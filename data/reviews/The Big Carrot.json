{"text":"I find myself shopping here less and less because I'm tired of staff and/or security following me around the aisles when I'm carrying my bike pannier. How about investing in cameras instead of following your paying customers around the store? Not to mention that the male staff make me feel uncomfortable too with their not-so-subtle leering. It happens every time I go and I'm sick of it."}
{"text":"they carry a lot of decent fresh grocery and skincare.  it is located in the high end neighborhood.  their food are very price.  the cafe has good vegan options"}
{"text":"If you want to find supplements and herbs from anywhere around the world, this is the place to come. they really have a lot. Every time i go the girls are so nice too, never impatient with my questions and really do seem knowledgable about the products!"}
{"text":"As a first time visitor I was expecting a lot more. Didn't realize everything was going to be so pricey. From $14 for an uncooked chicken to rather high priced grains, I think I'd go bankrupt shopping here on a regular basis. Fun to visit, but shopping here is another experience."}
{"text":"The Big Carrot is part of The Carrot Common, which is like a little enclave in the west end of health. Books, yoga, acupuncture etc. The Big Carrot is the health food store that is the backbone of the whole deal.  It's totally overpriced, and healthy and fantastic. There's this tea behind the counter that the guy recommends when you need a quick cleanse that will sort you right out.  They genuinely care about health and they're not pretentious, and let's face it, deep down, that's what we all want right? Some kind father figure who will sort our fast-food eating butts out without judgement."}
{"text":"Since the expansion of the Carrot into its neighboring space a number of years back, it has become my number one place to by organic and non-GMO products. They just have the best selection of products at quite reasonable prices for any health food or natural food store in Toronto AND the surrounding area. I've been to a few. There are a few exceptions in terms of price, but the Carrot is consistent about the quality of products they deliver."}
{"text":"hi!  the store should be called the big rip off not the big carrot!"}
{"text":"Agree with everyone on the jerky-ness of some customers. GET OVER YOURSELF!  But, that being said, I lurve this place. The deli is amazing - always has something delish ready to go. Great selections of healthy, organic, natural things... whatever 'thing' is your 'thing' they have it! Even as more of a health food admirer as compared to nut, this is THE place to go.  That being said, it is a bit pricey. I couldn't imagine doing ALL of my grocery shopping here. But if you're looking for something nummy and good for you, try it.  Try the cheese onion muffins. TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"I drove from Oakville to go to the dispensary here as the service over the years used to be exceptional. As of a week ago I don't feel the same way. I came in asking for a certain vitamin and the 2 ladies looked at me like I was an alien. Not polite or friendly AT ALL. The one lady came back with a couple things for me which I then purchased and went home with. The next day I realized that my vitamin safety seal was ripped off and the cover on the lid had been ripped off and half of the pills were missing. I drove ALL THE WAY back from Oakville and politely asked for new pills. Vanessa was the one helping me and not only was she rude, abrupt and defensive but she also didn't apologize once. She pretty much kept letting me know that it wasn't her fault and the fact that I had to get something different and replace it wasn't her fault either. It also wasn't her fault that what I exchanged the original pills for was $2 less and she would not be able to reimburse me the $2 but would have to give a store credit. I have never dealt with such a paranoid defensive person! I was nothing but nice to her and cooperative even though I had just spent $40 on gas going back TWICE from Oakville. I'm going to Whole Foods from now on as Vanessa makes that place look like a joke. Also do they not keep tabs on their products to make sure they are safe, sealed and not half empty??? I GUESS NOT! Bye forever!"}
{"text":"The Big Carrot Natural Food Market is my favourite place to shop for organic groceries and produce. They have a wide variety of produce compared to what the other BIG grocery stores have."}
{"text":"I have been shopping at The Big Carrot for over 2 decades and it keeps getting better and better. I was very proud of them for being the first health food store in Canada to go GMO-Free back in 2000 and they continue to set the health food industry standard. I love the atmosphere The Carrot Common (the larger community that includes The Big Carrot) creates. It is like a little village in a big city.  Be sure to try their Organic Curried Cashews. They are addictive!"}
{"text":"I can't explain how much I love the big carrot, they usually have whatever I need whether it's organic produce, vegan food, nutritional supplements, fresh smoothies, all natural beauty supplies & even cleaning products. Oh and their staff is generally friendly!  Edit: 5 star review to 3! I have been buying boxes of bananas from here for the past 2 months (not including shopping here for the past year) & I get them for $36 with the 10% off. I've asked a few times if I bought a few more boxes if I could get more of a deal, flat out nope. I now have to travel 20 minutes out if my way to another grocery store for my organic bananas for $30 a box, also they are happy to give more deals on other produce like oranges, apples, mangos, ect.. Really not pleased as the big carrot is very convenient for me & I have been buying most of my needs from there whether it be boxes of produce, vegan food, essential oils, my Paderno turning slicer and natural/cruelty free products like deodorant & makeup. I will still stop by once in a while but not so much for my produce."}
{"text":"I feel like there must be something I'm missing about this place. Every single person in here looked absolutely miserable, from the woman working at the cash to the person who said \"excuse me\" in the most irritated possible tone as she pushed herself past me. Why oh why are you all so frikkin miserable?  Perhaps it's because everything in here is so very over priced. Because it is. There's no denying that The Big Carrot has a fantastic selection of lots of things (I stopped in for locally sourced hot dogs and gluten free buns and I had options in both areas, which is something I can't say very often), but you're paying a super premium for those things. GF bread products are wickedly expensive at the best of times and prices at the Big Carrot were 1-2$ more than I've seen elsewhere.  For my money I'd rather buy local meat and seasonal produce at a farmer's market. It's cheaper, friendlier, and leaves me feeling more like I've contributed to something meaningful and less like I've been had by yet another marketing platform aimed at the alternative crowd."}
{"text":"I love shopping at the Big Carrot! This is the place to go for Organic food, staff is incredibly helpful and friendly, and they won't hesitate to help you."}
{"text":"They offer premium produce and products with premium prices to match. Given the price tag, you would expect them to implement some sort of parking validation system for its customers with a minimum spend. (I.e. The same way Whole Foods, Loblaws and every other grocery store in the city does.) I have been ticketed several times while doing my shopping (sometimes only while being in the store for 10 min). They have actually hired staff to go around with parking enforcement, pointing out which cars to give tickets to. I mentioned this politely to customer service and was met with unexpected rudeness and an unwillingness to help. I used to shop here multiple times a week doing the bulk of my grocery shopping here, I now make a point to bring my business elsewhere and maybe stop if I have to 1x p/month. Incredibly disappointing, they have zero appreciation for their customers."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy was I happy to have found this place when I moved to Toronto!  After having a natural food market so close to me Calgary, I suffered when I moved to Toronto without one nearby... and still, I had to travel far to frequent the Carrot.  Either way, glad to have it.  Prices on some items are definitely higher than in other places, but I do like that I can find organic food and other items that are locally made.  They're to-go food offerings and baked goods are pretty tasty as well.  Service can sometimes be a little stuffy, but I'm sure they see all kinds of different people walking through here.  Also helpful to know that the vitamins/supplements part of the store is just across the way, so you can get everything all in one area.    Overall, this is a pretty good stop for your natural food items... it says enough that even though I've moved away from Toronto, I still visit this place when I am back in town - I miss those damn pumpkin spice cookies I tell ya!"}
{"text":"Excellent diverse selection of mostly organic foods.  Good choices of prepared foods for restricted diets including gluten free, vegetarian, vegan and kosher.  But no one is going to shop here for cheap food - very high quality doesn't come cheap.  Check service is usually friendly.  Customer service within the store is totally hit or miss - sometimes the staff is extremely eager to help and sometimes the are just not interested.  Hours are also less customer friendly than other nearby specialty food shops like Sun Valley."}
{"text":"This review is about the cosmetic department.  What can I say but the douchey guy that works there ( you know who you are) is full of shit.    I took my mom there to help her buy some face oils and he was very eager to oversell us on these incredible life changing face oils and told us that if we weren't happy bring them back for a full refund.    Well my mother wasn't happy and so I went back yesterday to return the products based on my mothers dissatisfaction. Well the song changed now and supposedly since she used a certain amount of product we can only get a credit. I said look, you clearly stated refund before we forked over $100 for your life changing oils and since they failed miserably you won't take accountability for your empty promises?   Well I spoke with the manager and he decided to honour the word of the douche. As the said douche was processing my refund he was huffing and puffing! The nerve! When I was leaving I said \"thank you\" and nothing from him! Like seriously?   This is how you conduct business? I'd rather go to Whole Foods where they give a shit about customer service! I'm all about supporting local business but not one that doesn't appreciate my business.   Get your shit together and stop acting like  you're doing me a favour since I am the one spending my money. Ugh so annoying honestly. I'd advise against buying from this place. Ambrosia, Qi Natural foods, whole foods, and many other places are much better and their staff are actually nice!  I'd give this place ZERO stars if I could BTW!"}
{"text":"Im a big fan of shopping and eating local, and now that Ive moved to the east end of town, Im beyond thrilled that this is a short bike ride away. Hello antibiotic/preservative/growth-hormone-free bacon! Love!"}
{"text":"I am posting this review after visiting The Big Carrot approx 5-6 times.  CONS:  - Cramped store with awkward layout. - I consistently find that during busy times employees are restocking items that are already plentiful - their large carts are taking up precious, precious space! Common sense, please!  - Employees won't move when you're struggling to reach something-- and actually seem annoyed. Courtesy, please! - High prices, but unfortunately that is common with natural/organic markets. Comparable to Whole Foods, IMO. - Meat/fish eaters - I'd look elsewhere.  PROS:  - Points/reward system!  - Wonderful essential oil selection at a reasonable cost. Staff is very friendly in this section. - Large wholistic dispensary. - Juice bar! - Toronto Veg Association discount (only at the vegetarian deli- which is currently under renos). - Very close to the subway. - LOVE the Carrot Common!  OVERALL:  Not a place where I'll do the majority of my grocery shopping (who can afford that!), but I'll drop in for a few organic essentials. My advice is to go in with a zen attitude and ignore the occasional unfriendliness & lack of space."}
{"text":"For organics true-believers (raises hand) this is an awesome place. I just moved to Toronto, but I'm already in love with the Big Carrott (I live downtown and coming with the subway is a breeze).   There is a great selection of organics, much more than in other health stores (I'm spoiled by Italian organics-only stores. I'm a TRUE believer) and there are a lot of things I can't find elsewhere.  I think that prices are overall fair, some things are cheaper elsewhere, some are cheaper here, you can't really find everything cheapest in a store, but you have to see how convenient it is to shop all around rather than find everything in a place.  I like the beauty section with TRUE green products, I like the bulk section (would love everything to show the origin as well though, I'm picky) and overall there's a lot of variety. I also like the Deli (considering most is organic I don't find it so pricey, but I have to insist on bigger portions :)) and while I don't eat a lot of meat, at least I can find organic meat here. I also love the area, is so welcoming and nice. That's my kind of place, I can't deny it and I'll be shopping here often!"}
{"text":"Carrot Commons is a collection of shops all with enviro-conscious, health conscious, themes. As mentioned before, the Big Carrot and the dispensary are slightly more expensive than some of the other health food stores in Toronto (Essence of Life, Tutti Fruiti) but it really is in another league. The organic cafe serves up ready made meals that are really delicious and healthy and a good way to try \"exotic\" health foods you may never have had before.. like Quinoa.  For those well versed in exotic grains, there is a large bulk section for you to stock up. The bulk offering include grains, spices, pulses, legumes, rice, nut butters, honey, coffee, candy, salts (including Himalayan), sweeteners, and more.  My FAVORITE Big Carrot Offerings include  - Refillable \"pump\" style beauty products like shampoos, conditioners and Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps. You save a considerable amount of money and plastic bottles. Bring your own, or buy a refillable one on site. Good quality products as well. - Reverse Osmosis filtered water refilling station. You can bring in your own bottle, or buy from them. Reasonable prices. - Kleen Kanteen Lids for when you lose yours.  - Almond Milk for $2.19. BC is the only place I have found Chocolate, Vanilla and Regular all offered in unsweetened.   They have a wide variety of things otherwise hard to find like coffee substitutes. Lots of ready made and packaged things for those who want to eat healthy with convenience. Fresh sprouts, cheeses, dips, everything is of high quality, and there is lots to choose from.  For organic fruits and veg I find them just too expensive. I prefer the organic home delivery bins for my perishables. Otherwise, It is worth not having to go all the way to the west end to pick up some small things here and there. Helpful friendly staff too."}
{"text":"After shopping at the Big Carrot you feel like a healthier person.  They have a good produce section and about every type of organic product available (food, makeup, home care...)  I've always been skeptical of places like this because they  seem a bit on the hippy-ish side, but the Big Carrot is definately one of the cleanest health food stores in the neighbourhood, and their stuff seems to have a high-turn over rate.  Probably more environment friendly than whole foods (although if I had to choose I'd pick yorkville whole foods because its larger and more open).  On the upside its easier to find what you need at the Big Carrot because its smaller.  *Bonus- the carrot corner has a groovy smoothie bar"}
{"text":"I love the Big Carrot.  It has a large and varied selection, and I like the fact that all the products they sell meet strict environmental and ethical standards (even if it means that I need to go elsewhere the occasional time I want to buy something evil like aluminum foil).  I've always found the staff friendly and helpful.  The cash registers are very well staffed, so I find the lines move really quickly even on a busy weekend afternoon.  I really like the fact that it's an employee co-op, so the staff are earning a living wage.  Price-wise, it's more expensive than Loblaws, but cheaper than Whole Foods, at least on a general basis.  Prices on individual products vary: some products are cheaper than conventional supermarkets (for the same brands), while others are significantly more expensive.  But at the end of the day, I am getting better quality food than I would at Loblaws or Sobeys, for less than I would be paying at Whole Foods.  I know some people here have complained that they can get food cheaper at farmers' markets, but my experience is that Big Carrot is often cheaper than the organic farmers' markets.    My criticisms are few.  The main ones are:  The aisles are narrower than a typical supermarket, and staff tend to stock shelves during the day, so there are often \"traffic jams\" in the aisles during really busy times.  Sometimes the staff stocking the shelves ignore the people who cannot pass (it's the one staff discourtesy I have ever experienced at the store).  The produce is fine, but they could do better.  I really wish they would stock more vegetables from local farmers.  Sometimes it's disheartening to see the produce at the Big Carrot after visiting the farmers' market at the BrickWorks.  The fruits and vegetables section is certainly not as attractive as the one at Whole Foods.  I don't need the produce to be food-magazine pretty, but they could certainly work on their selection and presentation.  Too much of their stuff is shipped in from Mexico and similar places, even when Ontario produce is in season.   The Body Care department is fantastic, but their selection of men's products is weak, and they do not seem interested in expanding it.  When I commented that the plastic disposable men's razors they sell are not particularly environmentally friendly, even if they are made partly from recycled plastic, I was told that the razors could be used more than once (i.e. um, like any disposable drug store razor).  When I suggested that they stock DE-type razors and handles (far less waste), the manager simply pointed out that the plastic ones they sell aren't tested on animals.  Both times I raised the issue, the female staff seemed uninterested in men's products and out of their league.  It's fine if they do not want to sell DE-type razors or other men's products because they think demand would be weak, but it seems they do not want to offer them simply because they are not interested in learning about the products.  I have no idea the gender breakdown of the staff in the Body Care department, but it appears that it could use some male input."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy the big carrot, but today was not a good experience. I grabbed a few items (laundry detergent, almond butter, bread, oats, and a brownie) which came to about $45! As I was walking outside after paying, I went to unwrap the brownie from the plastic wrap, and about 1/3 of it crumbled to the ground instantly (as though it was soil)! I wrapped what was left and put it in my pocket.  When I got home I looked at my receipt, the almond butter I grabbed was on sale for $14.99 (main reason I grabbed it) yet I was charged $17.99. I was not pleased to see this, as it's a bit of a commute to get there by subway. What made it all worse, is when I went to eat what was left of the brownie (which cost $3.22 plus tax)...I wasn't even able to hold it with my hand to bite a piece, it just crumbled away into a soil like consistency - I had to eat it with a spoon and it was bland, dry, unappetizing.   Really not a good experience today, I would appreciate a refund on the brownie and what I was overcharged, or I really don't see the point in trying again."}
{"text":"Organic produce here is cheap to comparable natural food stores (i.e. Whole Foods). Strawberries ($3.99), cauliflower ($2.99), gala apples ($1.99/lb) just to name a few. Great selection of packaged goods some brands I haven't seen at other grocers. Fully stocked items even though it was mid day Saturday.   Small store so variety is limited. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Once I realized that every trip to this store I would find something great, and at the same time find  something equally disappointing, I knew I would continue to shop there. I find myself at an appointment near this store about twice a month. The aromas wafting out the door are very enticing. But, often the produce is nothing short of disgusting....and very overpriced. Hidden in the aisles I always find a purchase or two. The breads look wonderful, but again the prices! Something always jumps out at me and I don't regret the expense. I see people with carts full to the brim and I wonder, WHY? I usually have my small bag of goodies to take home and the bulk of the shopping is done elsewhere. And the parking, well, that too can be an issue. Expensive, lack of spots and too often the ticket machines are out of order. So,  all in all, not worth a special trip. But, if there anyway, I like to have a look."}
{"text":"The carrot doesn't stand for what it used to anymore. The amount of waste they produce at the deli, the vegetarian resto set up right beside frozen meats, the easy availability of plastic bags over the hidden reusable ones for produce, lack of local produce... Only go there for organic cinnamon buns :)"}
{"text":"I came here to purchase some essential oils. They have a great selection of oils, and they were reasonably priced. Didn't really look at anything else they had to offer, but I'm sure it's great. Checkout was fast and service was good. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This review is only for the grocery store items and natural beauty products.  I recently found this place and I have to tell you, it's pretty amazing. A great variety of organic toiletries but also organic food.   I will tell you that the prices are higher than at Kensington Market, Whole Foods and at Herbs & Nutrition (all 3 places I shop at). They're not significantly higher like at $1 more, (only about $0.30 more), but we certainly won't be going out of our way to visit this store to buy our food.  The cashier was very friendly, and so was the lady milling about the toiletries section. I can't believe the wall of stuff they have, although you have to make sure to check that it's not made in China.  It reminds me of a Whole Body store I once visited in Chicago. Lots of great things to look at and I second the reviewer who says it's better than the Whole Foods beauty and personal care selection in Yorkville."}
{"text":"This place has anything you could possibly want in a health food store. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is I find the staff a tad aloof. That could be a result of their large size and numerous staff. They don't take the \"ownership\" that staff in a smaller store might take."}
{"text":"This place is very welcoming. It has a ton of natural organic products. The most I've seen anywhere. They also have an adjacent vitamin shoppe but I never buy my vitamins there. They are so expensive! Walk Mart is better or online. They also have a ton of books and skin care products. I like that they let you try the product before buying them and they even give you a sample to take home. Sometimes they give you so little is not even worth the trouble. But at least they offer that. Nowhere I have seen stores do that. The prices are not that competitive. But you do get a really great experience. I'll recommend going to tutti fruity instead located at Kensington market If you are shirt of money. But if money is not an issue. Here is the place to come."}
{"text":"Organic everything at exhorbitant prices.  A quintessential Toronto institution."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the size of this store as I was thinking ah well just another small sized corner health food store. I would say it is like a mini sized Wholefoods.  Full disclosure here I am not by any means an all organic feed fan and don't believe that the best things come from the deepest/darkest parts of the jungle.  Never mind I gave this place a thorough check and enjoyed my visit here. The meat area  was surprisingly sparse when compared with the produce section.  The produce section has good items and a decent variety. They have vegetarian only cooked food counter where one can buy food by weight etc. The frozen items section was OK and had a decent variety.  The personal care section is separate from the main store (I find the idea of a all natural shampoo repulsive as one should benefit from the advances in tech)  I don't have reference point for prices but I guess they do charge a premium over big chain stores as after all it is part of their chic. 3 stars."}
{"text":"The staff are always so helpful and I find they have a wide range of interesting finds that you obviously can't find at franchise supermarkets or stores. I love their selection and always spend at least an hour or more (guilty) just in awe of all the different kinds of products I could use for a better quality of living and for health purposes of course! Such a great little niche in the Danforth area - will be back in the nearby future and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the original natural food stores, I've been dropping into this place since when it was located across the street.  I say drop in because it is not my first choice but my last option. I prefer to shop most anywhere else simply because they are over priced on just about everything and the service is lacking.  The market is getting more competitive and my opinion the Big Carrot is pricing themselves out."}
{"text":"This is just about the beauty section (although I've had some food from their hot table and it was delicious!).  I came here after realizing that I've probably been using toxic chemicals on my face and body for years. Maybe that's why I've got the skin of a teen hitting puberty. I could spend hours in here gazing at all the different creams, soaps and makeup. I came into the store without a clue as to what I was after but their staff was more than helpful and I ended up leaving with a few new products in hand.  I overheard one staff member saying that they have tightened restrictions on what they can sell here as far as legitimately \"natural\" and \"organic\" products go (and as I've recently learned by watching \"Marketplace\", any company can slap that title on their products and still contain unsafe ingredients). I referenced cosmeticsdatabase.com for some of the products that I examined in my nearly hour-long visit. The site lists all kinds of products and their ingredients. They rate how safe a product is (discovered that useful site through ecoholic!). Most of the products I checked out got a decent rating except a couple of 4's (low-moderate).  I ended up purchasing a moisturizer by a Canadian company called \"Green Beaver\" (titter). I've got really oily skin but want something that I can safely use under my eyes as well (for my nice set of bags). This cream seems to be pretty decent and they're pretty cheap! Plus, supporting Canadian companies is a bonus to make you feel extra good about yourself! They have a good selection of non-toxic sunblock and bug repellents too! Some can get a bit pricey but there's some cheaper ones. I got a cheap facial sunblock. Sure, it makes me look like a ghost when I first apply it but a little bit of gruntwork does the trick! I would love to invest in some makeup there as they seem to have a good selection but I had to tighten my purse strings as I had already purchased shampoo, astringent, moisturizer, bug repellent, body cream and pretty much everything else for the body/face. I've been to a couple other health stores but the staff weren't as helpful as they were here and for people who have no idea where to start, that's definitely a good thing!"}
{"text":"As a grocery store the options are amazing, especially if you have dietary restrictions however be wary of the salad bar, I warn people a lot you may think your going to be paying an already unreasonable $16 for a damn expensive salad, only to find out it's $28 dollars!!  Gets the newbies every time!  It's a beautiful market but really watch what you are paying. It can be over the top."}
{"text":"This is the go to stop for any and all Organic food you can possibly attain in Toronto. My parents are big on eating Organic and Natural Foods so we frequent here a lot. The Coffee Stop around the corner too has some wonderful coffee blends and lots of nice finger foods to choose from (all organic). The staff is wonderful here too and very helpful.  If you make it here early enough make sure to buy a lot of the fresh bread, pastries they get shipped in daily. The cheese sticks are to die for. Whoever makes them should get a medal. I literally drool before I even bite down on one lol!  It is best to get here as early as you can especially on the weekends as it gets packed fast with customers and parking is very limited. If you do not know the area, your in for some road rage finding a spot."}
{"text":"I've been shopping at the Big Carrot since 1990! First the pros:  -They used to be the only bigger organic and natural food store in Toronto and they therefore were trailblazers in this market.  - They were one of the first stores to take a stand against GMO foods (and still one of the very few). They worked hard to eliminate GMOs in their food section. -They have one of the best selections of organic, non GMO and local foods. It is better than Whole Foods who sell a lot of non-organic foods. -They financially support organic farmers and other small alternative food businesses. -Their supplements department has an excellent selection and the prices for supplements are generally reasonable compared to other supplement retailers. -They are a co-op and therefore the people who work there receive fair compensation and decent working conditions (as far as I can tell). Now the cons: -Aside from a few friendly people at the cash, most of the people who work there are not friendly at all. I've been seeing the same faces for over 25 years (a testament of how good the working conditions must be), however some of the people who work there never say hi or even seem to recognize me! -I hate the new deli. The layout is terrible. It makes the Big Carrot much less inviting as a store because there no longer is any seating close to the deli (the message seems to be that the Big Carrot no longer wants customers to linger in the store unless they are shopping). The deli food is too expensive. I used to eat lunch or a snack at the Big Carrot while doing my shopping, but I refuse to pay close to $20 for a salad and then eat it at that cramped counter on the other side of the cashiers.  -The Big Carrot has relaxed their policy on non-GMO ingredients. However, they did it quietly. Many of the supplements and personal care products do contain GMO ingredients. Apparently it's too difficult to stock the shelves with non-GMO products in these two departments. I shop at the Big Carrot regularly (although a lot less than I used to) and I didn't know about this shift in policy until I asked. More transparency would be nice. -Prices are too high. I've cut down significantly on how much I shop at the Big Carrot because of the prices. Fortunately there now are more choices of where to shop such as farmers markets and other natural food stores."}
{"text":"I have shopped at the Big Carrot for more than 25 years from the days before Carrot Common existed so they're clearly doing something right to bring me back every week.  However, they changed the way the deli works and now I never buy anything from those warming tables; nothing looks fresh or particularly appetizing where they formerly had a great selection of prepared foods. I used to buy two to three containers of prepared food weekly so at least I'm saving money!  Finally, there are a few cashiers who need to realize they are being paid to ring up AND pack my groceries; while they may be moderately amusing, I'm not paying $200 a week to pack my own bags. (I'm looking at you, d@v!d, though he's not the only one.) Fortunately, I know which cashiers do the work they're paid to do and only go to them."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!!! I usually shop at Whole Foods in the U.S, but I hate the prices and how crowded they are.   Big Carrot has all of the best stuff you get at Whole Foods and beautiful product but without the uber-long lines and hefty prices.   I am so glad to have this place in my neighborhood!  The Good Great organic produce Great dry goods area Great coffee Great ethnic foods Great dairy and soy and all that jazz Some Stuff is Cheap (Eden Organic Garbanzos for $2 -- cheapest I've ever seen!) Fresh seeming baked breads Nice looking veggie cafe Body and vitamin store attached! Co-Ops are cool  The Not so Hot Some stuff is oddly expensive (Ezekiel cereal -- $8?) Gets crowded at 5pm and small aisles means lots of bumping with fellow customers Pay for parking :( Fish offerings, pitiful  I will be back, in fact, I'm heading there again right now!"}
{"text":"Horrible! I went there a couple weeks ago and now find out they have a major outbreak of Hepatitis A ... now I have to go get a vaccination from Toronto Health because I'm at risk of a disease. I'm almost having a panic attack right now... Thanks a lot!"}
{"text":"I prefer Whole Foods and Wild and Fresh. I really do.   My Big Carrot experience was okay...they did have some of the yogurt and eggs and meat pies I was looking for, but so does Wild and Fresh and Whole Foods. But, what brought the shopping times down was the people. I have never experienced a more rude, pushy and ignorant group of shoppers. I had people stare right at me and walk and stand in front of me. I try to buy organic about every other time I grocery shop. When I go, I feel empowered, healthy and like I am helping for the betterment of this great world of ours. But everyone I encountered looked like and acted like someone shit in their flax seeds.   I guess I like Whole Foods and Wild and Fresh better cause there is more selection, and particularly with Whole Foods - omg...the meat...beautiful, beautiful stuff. Plus their bakery....make you want to cry and call your mommy. Did I mention Whole Foods has free parking too?!   I will say I did not check out the beauty section, and that was mostly because the other shoppers were ticking me off. I will give it another chance, and hit the beauty section first.   Hopefully I will be able to update this review with more raves : )"}
{"text":"I went in to pick up a new filter for my shower head. A little pricey but a great selection of healthy items. A wee bit pricey. Clean store and friendly staff."}
{"text":"the review is only for the food counter/cafe inside the store.  the variety of dishes is soooo vast and intriguing. I was lost.  you pay by weight and the prices are reasonable - 3 different dishes on one plate ended up costing me only under $8 the service is quick and attentive too.  there is also a huuuge variety of ingredients and foods to buy but I didn't really check anything except actual hot food as I was hungry. a place to be for a vegetarian=)"}
{"text":"Love it here.  Great selection and quality produce. Not the most friendly environment but that's why I am there to shop and not make friends. :)"}
{"text":"We just stopped in for a coffee, but were glad to see that they served only vegetarian stuff. Bought their burger, an Oatmeal cookie with some nuts and fruits embedded and were delicious. Think of going there again and would recommend it to anyone, lovely place."}
{"text":"I like the place a lot - it's got a bulk section for your organic nuts, seeds and dry things, any sort of gluten free/wheat free alternative you might be looking for, and tons of choice.  But there are things that have started to bug me.   For instance, I can never FIND anything in here. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I was looking for my butter alternative spread, and I always wander and wander, but never seem to find the right place.  Most times I just come here for the good sales they have on Almond Milk, and Quinoa from the bulk section.   Parking.  They have a paid parking system (not Green P, so some might say you don't have to pay to park, but if you get ticketed, u might have a debt collector bothering you).  Before, it wasn't as strict, but I've noticed that they've now hired a person (at least in the summer time, peak hours like evening) to stand around and check people's tickets.  If you see this man in a black t-shirt, beware and go pay.  I wonder what they are going to do in the winter time.   So I went to go pay. I knew I would only be in there to grab my Quinoa and go, so really only needed 15 mins = $0.25. Nope. Minimum $1 (i.e. an hr). How annoying.   There is also free parking after 6 on the streets adjacent if you have time and feel inclined to drive around."}
{"text":"I've been shopping at the big carrot for at least 2 years. I don't live close however taking the 40min drive is worth it to shop at a store where everything is Organic. Until today. Today is the last day I ever shop here. Being followed by the female lost prevention worker is not a nice feeling. She trailed me through EVERY SINGLE aisle I went in. I even confronted her dumb ass and asked if she was lost prevention. She said no. But of course I knew she was lying as I've seen her before but she's never followed me (or maybe I didn't notice until today). After I confronted her she disappeared and I cashed out. I then walked across to the dispensary to get my vitamins and guess who was there! That is where she went to run off to. I did complain and the manager said she would be speaking to her and her boss but they've lost my business and several others as I've recommended them to tons of my friends. To add to this review they overcharged me!! Why didn't I look over my bill! Icing on the cake with this place!"}
{"text":"The Big Carrot is an excellent resource for all organic foods.  And that is really the crux... it is all organic and has most everything.   People complain about the prices and they are certainly right it is pricey but I rarely have to get in my car and spend $5.00-$10.00 on gas plus my precious time running around the neighbourhood  or further afield looking for the items I want.  So you have to add that into the equation.  Most of the other stores if I call ahead like for instance Healthy Planet will be missing several items on my list.   The Carrot has 95% of what I require.  If not the Bulk Barn is just down the street a block or so and then there is upayanaturals.com on line which will ship me the items the Carrot draws a blank on.  And when they draw a blank they really do.  They stare at you as if you are from outer space.... they never heard of such a thing and have no clue where to direct you to source it.  This attitude would be a good one to change.   So as a one stop it is great.  But you will pay extra for the privilege and the meals and soups at the cafe are always tasty. If you are gluten free they have one of the best selections of breads around town. And the best tasting ones.  Just buy several and put them in your freezer."}
{"text":"I love the Big Carrot, their produce and products are great!  Staff are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of whole foods; a holistic dream! 3 stars because they sold me EXPIRED food. It was on sale, but the reason was not specified (AHEM, ITS EXPIRED). Exp. date says 01/27/16; I purchased 02/03/16. Thanks for the stale granola, Big Carrot!"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with The Big Carrot.   Love: 1) I can buy small portions of meat that was raised well for a decent price (not like the $18 monster packages of chicken at the regular supermarket). 2) Sprouted tofu close to home 3) Juice bar next door for the days I'm too lazy to clean the juicer at home 4) Raw and paleo products for when I get in my fad-diet moods (those paleo wraps are delicious, but soooooo overpriced) 5) Pretty much the whole product line of Tofurky. My guilty pleasure secret love.  Hate: 1) Overpriced on almost everything. There is a competitor a couple blocks down that sells most of the same stuff but cheaper. I only come back here for the better selection. 2) Severe lack of grass-fed beef. 3) Most self-absorbed patrons in the city. I've never seen so many people just stop in the middle of the aisle blocking half with the cart, half with the body and refusing to move despite the line up of five people trying to get by in each direction.  4) Staff are entirely uninterested. The customer service desk is the only place you might see a glimmer of life. The people stocking shelves don't make eye contact. The cashiers don't bother with hello, goodbye, please, or thank you. Not really the friendly neighbourhood vibe I imagined the place would have.  I plan to keep shopping there but there's definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE The Big Carrot. They have everything you need -- from groceries, beauty products, vitamins, freshly made juices and more. Also love that it's located in the heart of the Danforth. You can rest assured that you're purchasing GOOD QUALITY products that are good and safe for your body and mind.   If you get a chance to visit the juice bar, I recommend the Amazon Warrior; that's some good ish! Majority of their ingredients are also certified organic which is awesome for a health junkie like myself.   The vitamin store and juice bar are definitely \"must visits.\"  I've been a customer for years and will continue to be. Definitely my favourite health food store, hands down."}
{"text":"Blink too fast and you may miss the Big Carrot.  I call it an organic version of Whole Foods. Tucked away off the busy hussle and bussle of the Darforth, Big Carrot is great for finding organic food. Especially rare stuff..  They are one of the few retail grocers in Toronto to sell tofurkeys. For those who don't know what i'm talking about they are vegan turkeys. They don't really taste like turkeys but it's the idea that counts! :-)   Their hot plates section is pretty good too. It rivals Whole Foods cold food selection, but I think Whole Foods has the upper hand. A lot of vegetarian and vegan meals, quite interesting and tasty.   Pricewise, not the most bang for your buck.  But I guess if you're shopping organic you're somewhat use to the prices. At the very least pick up a tofurkey dinner! :-)"}
{"text":"I absolutely ADORE the Big Carrot. To me, it is like a gem. it's BETTER than a gem. Everything they sell here is healthy, so there is no need to screen through your purchases and worry about nasty hidden ingredients. The produce are ALL organic! another plus for Big Carrot :) Sure, the prices are a bit of the high side, but it's ok compared to Whole Foods. I LOOOOVE their Vegetarian Cafe section as most of the ingredients used to cook the foods are organic. ans not to forget the bakery section, in which most of the ingredients are also healthy and organic, unlike the ones that Whole Foods bake, which are filled with white sugar and white flour :S In conclusion, Big Carrot is worth the visit, even for someone living in scarborough =)"}
{"text":"I've been going to The Big Carrot since they opened.  It's my favorite place to buy organic food.  They have one of the best selections in organic products.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love The Big Carrot.   I love their selections of food, their staff and their location. The prices can be steep but so can many of the other options out there. If I am feeling especially light in the wallet one week, I will simply go elsewhere. But when it comes to food, if I can get top quality, then I don't mind paying top prices.  I am moving a bit further away where there will be other enticing options, but I can still see myself going there whenever I am in the neighbourhood.  MUST TRY: Yukon Gold Bread"}
{"text":"I have been here several times as it's my New Years resolution to eat healthier so far it's going ok. However, this place has been my saving grace. There is a huge selection of natural foods, great quality of local produce, plus so much more. I am impressed at the sheer size and selection of items. I have started eating a lot more grains that I never knew existed, I am taking better care of my self, and I am even using some natural products on my hair, face, and to shave with. Probably one of the nicest things about this place is the little restaurant they have right in the middle of all the action. There is a nice selection of grab and go food for a quick meal on the go or you can sit for a minute and enjoy.  Of course all these great goodies do come with a price tag. You will pay a little more for almost everything here then you would pay anywhere else. Quality of any kind cost more, always. I have found that it was been well worth the hike in price, so I do recommend that you stop by and see for your self."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally. Semi-regularly, really. I come here because I like their organic foods, their juices are quite good, and they make the BEST MOCHA EVER. mmm...mocha. The prices are a little high, but not for what you're getting. I pay it gladly for the quality.   The customer service is where they are lacking here. A few of the staff are friendly, but most are stone faced when they ask you what you'd like. None have been rude to me, ever, but I sometimes wonder if smiles cost extra...  Speed is not their strong suit, either. I realise that this isn't fast food, it's organic, but A) organic doesn't mean slow, B) blending fruits and veggies, really shouldn't take that long, and C) the staff seem to chat to each other a lot. I'll wait 4-5 minutes for my drink when there's no one else in the shop. When there are people in the shop, I usually just go elsewhere (why I'm not a regular), because I work by appointments, and I often don't have the extra time to wait."}
{"text":"In my (our?) life (lives?) we've all been faced with that friend who chooses a mate you just don't jibe with. Call it the \"she's with HIM?\" syndrome.   I bring this up because the staff at the Carrot are amazing. The food at the Carrot is amazing. The customers are doucebags. Not all (obviously) but every time I've been there, without fail there seems to be a customer berating a staff member for this or that. Anyhoo.  The prepared foods are incredible. There's always some organic greens or amazing quinoa dish that is truly delicious. However, I can't get over the customers. 4.5 stars for the  company you keep, Big Carrot!"}
{"text":"I have a big HEART-on for the Big Carrot! Who doesn't love this place? I mean COME ON, PEEPS!  Most important star factors for me:  1. They carry Ying Ying Soy Food products. They keep up their stock. A reliable source in the East End for my favourite tofu = Priceless!  2. The staff aren't snobby.  3. Clean, well laid out, and doesn't smell weird. So many similar establishments SMELL SO WEIRD. Not an issue here  4. Is this the biggest retail store of its kind in Toronto? It's the biggest I've been to! YAY!  Lose a star:  Why can't I FIND anything here??? Maybe it's me... but I just don't get the layout. What is the suggested pathway through the store to see everything? Where is the signage? Help!  Lose another star but I'm not actually deducting it:   As others have said, the OTHER CUSTOMERS are the worst thing here - I want to slap that \"holier than thou\" smug look right off their face and trip them so they fall right into the gluten-free bread display and it all goes EVERYWHERE. Douchebags."}
{"text":"The Big Carrot is one of my favourite places to go in Toronto. They are tucked in the back of a little interlock courtyard in east Toronto called Carrot Common - other establishments that make up Carrot Common are The Big Carrot's dispensary and juice bar, as well as a health clinic and Book City.   The Big Carrot specializes in \"health,\" which covers food, health and beauty products as well as books. They have bulk foods, fresh baked goods, frozen foods, produce, convenience foods, boxed foods, plus a really great hot foods cafe. All the items from the cafe have the ingredients listed plus a different coloured tag for \"Made without Gluten\" and \"Made without Dairy\" so it's easy to spot if you are into those things.   Their beauty section has the traditional hippie products you would expect to find in a health food store (Dr. Bronner's anyone?) but also really great newer brands of makeup, nail polish and fragrance that are free of traditional chemicals packed into drugstore brands.   In the grocery section, you can find pretty much any type of specialty health food. If you are looking for raw gluten-free vegan, soy-free nut-free, organic free-range, local, or any type of food that you need to be free of something, chances are you will find it here. Although they have a large section of veggie options and don't offer any meat at their cafe, they are not an exclusively vegetarian store and they do carry a wide variety of meat - they have lots of local and organic options. Some stuff is a little pricey, but like anything it pays to shop around. There are definitely items that are cheaper here than other places in the city (I always make sure to pick up their maple syrup, a big container for not a lot of money).   The juice bar can make any of their smoothies non-dairy and soy-free. I have a tragic weakness for the Hippie Hemp Shake with Maple, plus their seasonal smoothie flavours like Pumpkin Pie. You can also get salads, wraps and sandwiches if you are looking for a quick lunch.   On Thursdays there is a free lecture series (upstairs above Book City) with speakers that have been sourced by the store's head nutritionist, and cover topics like Eastern Medical Approaches to Depression, Warming Foods for Winter and even movie screenings and round-table discussions. They have cooking classes offered and you can sign up for nutritional consultations, where one of the store's team of nutritionists will meet with you about your needs and then actually shop around the store with you and make recommendations.   The Big Carrot has covered every angle of being a health food store, and while I am sure they do edit their selection they have great options for people who may otherwise feel that healthy eating and living requires them to edit (rather than expand) their grocery list."}
{"text":"Obviously I'd rather give my money to a co-operative than to the owners of Amazon (looking at you, Whole Foods). People don't realize it, but the Big C supports many small local organic businesses get off their feet, they assist their community, they've put in a beautiful rooftop garden and they are GMO-free! This is the kind of store you want to support instead of a chain.  Employees get way better benefits than at WF and they don't get fired for bringing a coffee from home and using some cream from work. WF is turning so fascist, it's a pleasure to support a store that has more folks living the lifestyle and who know what they're talking about when you ask for help.  Sure the produce has been off this past year, there are things constantly out of stock and the deli offerings could be so much better (look at my instagram, please!), but overall the selection is fantastic and everything is well organized. It's our communities' health food store, but also draws customers from as far away as Buffalo, NY. I will always support them and wish them all the best. I've been a customer for 31 years."}
{"text":"*this is about the apothecary/dispensary only*  I went In a couple of weeks ago to buy a calcium supplement that wasn't in a liquid form because I'm preggers and was planning to travel.  I didnt want to carry a glass bottle on a plane even in my checked luggage (then you always have to find a spoon to take it too.  I bought the one they recommended only to get home and read the label a few weeks later to find that it's not recommended for pregnant women.  Argh.  Word to the wise, make sure you read the labels of everything despite what the people who work there say.  Lucky I didn't really use it, but I've lost faith in their staff, that's for sure.  For a place that sells their goods at a premium relative to other health food stores I expect more.  I'm disappointed, but I should read the label.  Not a place to shop if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"well ill be damned.  the big carrot, despite the annoyed pseudo-hippy that moped past me as we walked in, seemed pretty slicked up.  it seemed that not too long ago they were bedecked with simpler shelves, simpler displays and more run of the mill registers.  well without an examination of the details, the space seemed a lot roomier.  or alternately, it seemed more visually geared towards people who could afford to regularly shop here - branded, if that makes any sense.  itd be great to be able to shop here consistently, as most items are organic and there are lots of healthy choices and better quality choices of foods thatll make you fat.  (ill often catch myself saying, as i stuff my face with special chips, or a swatch of baked bread, or an oozing cheese, \"but its organic?!\").  i do believe, however, that all in all it was a MUCH healthier, and (as it should be) tasty lunch we decided to have there, than the alternatives on the danforth.    inside of this shopping eden, there lay a vegetarian cafe, called nothing other than...vegetarian cafe.  np i say.  here you get to choose from a buffet of big carrot made dishes.  we had a curry carrot coconut soup: bright orange with a little kick.  that came with two mildly fresh slices of a small baguette with a turd of butter on each.  (though the natural colour of butter it was, its placement and paltriness seemed to bring that to mind.).  i went to go to get spoons and could only find one soup spoon.  so i had to get a tea spoon after they explained to me that they didnt have any left at the time.  boo bad planning.    after that we had a plate filled with a few dishes:  one was pureed, bright green spinach and tofu mixed together.  alongside that sat a brownish green puree of something.  it was good.  it seemed like there was chicken in it, but i was confident by that simply chosen and very effective moniker of \"Vegetarian Cafe\" that there was no need whatsoever to confirm, but rather to just enjoy it. (my wife tried to confirm, couldnt, and ate it anyway).  some fried tofu in green curry found its way into the mix.  that dribbled on some kind of grain.  i didnt bother asking too much what things were made of; it was all a visual experience for me. and all was washed down with a zesty chick pea salad.  the girl behind the counter, i was delighted to know, asked me whether i wanted my plate heated up by microwave or oven.  microwaves shrivel food and make bread weird.  i was thankful for the wait as we slurped soup.  after that we roamed the store - we always seem to split apart and try to cover more ground or perhaps we just each get preoccupied with what we like - and we found the food we wanted.  it was nice to pick up a bunch of clementines - theres certain fruit thatll be crappy when you go to cheaper places, and these are those kinds - in fact im going to get one right now.  (go and do something for a couple of minutes and youll get the 'happening in real time' feel here)  sooooooooooooooo good.  yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhh organic.  im glad i started writing this review, its so refreshing."}
{"text":"Best grocery store!!!  First - it small. way smaller than whole food. But, they have only the best product! I like the soy cheese selection. So much non-dairy milk!!  Second - Best burritos!  Third - It pricey, but good food. Cheaper than Whole Food tho.   Four - Cucumbers too expensive.   Cashiers are hippies. They funny!"}
{"text":"Love the big carrot. Especially the veg food bar - books great too -  skincare products - endless selection of hard to find organic and obscure foods. Nothing bad to say!"}
{"text":"I'm at the Carrot so much that I sort of feel wierd about reviewing it...like I'm reviewing a family member or something.  Anyway, the place is way more personable than Whole Foods and way more organized than most smaller health food groceries with a pretty great selection of goods.  Great bread section and real good soups at the prepared food counter.  Prices can be a little steep but if you're patient and come often enough you can catch some pretty good deals.   They've got a reverse osmosis water filtration machine for those who like to get their own water and a 18L water bottle can be filled for $2.60.  Once you've tasted reverse osmosified you can not go back."}
{"text":"This place is a good, but expensive place to buy healthy, vegetarian, vegan foods. They also have a lot of foods for people with gluten, wheat, and nut allergies. They also have takeout food which looks more delicious than it actually is. Just because it is healthy doesn't mean it should taste healthy, you know??  I do enjoy going to The Big Carrot, but I usually limit myself to going when I have something specific in mind otherwise I end up spending waaay too many dollars."}
{"text":"Not cheap, but their demo is yuppies. I generally only come here for things I can't find anywhere else (ie: Sheese). It's also probably worth noting that any Rowe Farms meat on sale here is nearly double what you'd pay at any Rowe store (deli meats $8 here and $5 at Rowe for example), so just get it straight from them instead of here."}
{"text":"Probably the best store in the area to buy organic, sustainable, and high quality food, supplements, and body care products. Most of the staff are knowledgable, helpful and well-trained in customer care. If you're buying supplements, across the lane, the staff will spend as much time as you need, to help you find the right item, and the head guy there is friendly, caring, and super-knowledgable.  The body care department has a good selection of anything you need, and the best selection of essential oils from Canadian companies, Divine Essence, out of Quebec, being my favourite. If they don't have something, they will order it for you, and the wait time is often less than what they say.  The food items are constantly being re-stocked, while you're shopping, and the stock staff will stop what they're doing, and go out of their way to find something for you, or inquire with the manager as to it's availablity. The bulk section is always well-stocked, clean, and abundant, and the produce is always fresh and of excellent quality. Their prepared foods department, with their dine-in area, has the best selection of take-away foods, with an emphasis on being vegetarian, and it's always busy, so that tells you something.  The check-out staff are friendly, and accommodating, and rarely do you have to wait longer than a few minutes, as they bring out more cashiers whenever there's high volume. It's not a large store, but once you get used to it, it's a joy to shop here. If ever you have a problem with your purchase, providing it's authentic, they will refund your money within 30 days with your receipt.  Their prices for some items are somewhat higher than what you may find elsewhere, but after shopping here for 3 years, I've come to realize that you get what you pay for. The only reason they get a 4 star rating is that a small few of their staff can bring their bad moods to work, and to me, this is not acceptable. If it weren't for that, I'd give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"When we travel, finding a health store is a priority for my wife. Whole Foods maybe represents the monster of this format, so it's great to find a smaller format.   The Big Carrot has assign in the window celebrating 30 years. This, along with the busy aisles is a true sign of success."}
{"text":"The vegan cupcakes are amazing! This is a picture of cookies and cream, lavender, vanilla, and smores cupcakes. The cookies and cream cupcake had super rich icing that tasted just like ice cream. The cupcake is very dense and rich, which is just how I love my cupcakes. The texture and taste are better than most non vegan cupcakes. Thank you for the awesome treat!"}
{"text":"My first time here, I was completely overwhelmed. I didn't know where to go first. I felt like a kid in a candy store. An organic candy store.   If you aren't familiar with eating organic or vegetarian, this is a great place to start out. I don't do a lot of shopping here, I have to admit. Its out of the way and I do find it pricey - but you get what you pay for.   I do, however, stop by for healthier versions of chips, cheesies, salsa, etc. I can't keep my husband away from that stuff, so I feel better about him eating this alternative. Not to mention, I'll eat it too because I find these ones so much more flavourful.   I also love the health and beauty section. You can bring in your own bottles and fill them with natural shampoos and conditioners. Its a great way to try them out. My biggest find here was \"badger balm\" - its almost like the natural version of vicks vapo-rub. It is used as a sleep aid, but there's other varieties for when you are ill. It is amazing, and works better than vicks. And there's a cute little curled up badger on the tin that makes me smile. I looked for this stuff all over. Even when I worked at a nutrition/supplement store as a buyer, I tried to bring this in and corporate wouldn't let me. Big Carrot has everything though - its much better than searching store-to-store at all the small chains in Toronto.   I love coming here because I always find something new. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Come on you miserable-looking sods!  You're surrounded by exclusive artisan produce and enough organic stock to buy you a round trip to the righteous land of holier-than-thou Vegan Saints, so why can't you turn that frown upside down?    Is your soul tormented by the thought of so much unnecessary suffering in this world, or are you just in need of more half-caf Fairtrade shade-grown coffee with organic no-sugar-added soy milk?   Or are you off caffeine right now?   Doing a cleanse?   Did you accidentally eat some gluten or dairy last night and are even now experiencing the horror or increased mucus production or a rumbling of IBS?   Perhaps your lunch was accidentally heated, resulting in you eating a less-than-raw diet?  Oh, I digress.  I generally only visit this store when I'm in the area, which is to say about once or twice a year. Once upon a time it was a true destination in and of itself, but the prices can no longer justify my transit time unless I'm already headed in that general direction.  All kidding aside, the stock here is wonderful; I can almost always find what I'm looking for, although it's priced at a premium. I would not compare the shopping experience to Whole Foods, mostly because the staff at Whole Foods are much more friendly.  I definitely brace myself before I shop here.  Customers here look a bit forsaken, but I guess that's to be expected with so much to worry about in the way of Health and it's affiliated neuroses.  Unfortunately, working or shopping here is not on the application for sainthood. You can take that long-suffering look off your face now."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, one of the main reasons why I can't move away from The Danforth is The Big Carrot. I've been grocery shopping here religiously for the past 4 years and love the convenience of having such a great shop so close to home.  The main reasons why I love The Carrot so much are: - they carry only organic and non gmo food - they have a great reputation so I know I'm not getting conventional products in organic boxes (I've seen this happen with my own eyes at a small fruit market up the street where the employee added conventional berries in an organic box!!) - everyone that I've encountered working here has always been really helpful and pleasant  - they have a great selection of everything from produce to cleaning supplies, I especially love trying the different products they carry in their beauty care department and their ice cream selection :D - they have a dispensary and juice bar for those super lazy days - they make amazing soups and have quite a selection of ready to eat dishes *if your coming for soup go early they sell out everyday  - they have a points card so you can collect points on every dollar when you shop *if you don't have a card make sure to ask for one at the customer service desk before shopping that way you can have your points added on right away, also BYOB (bring your own bags) and receive extra points! - I usually bring my grocery buggy to push my groceries home and always leave it with customer service when I come into the store and its always waiting for me when its time to cash out   I admit I price check when I go to different shops and the prices here are pretty standard with other shops carrying organic/non gmo items. A lot of the times I've found items here, which were a lot cheaper than others... So don't be fooled by what you read from others, it isn't too pricey to shop here and even if you still think it is, think of it this way... You are what you eat."}
{"text":"A great variety of natural health food products located in the heart of Greek town! This is one of the places I go to look for specialty products that big chain stores don't carry. Sometimes things can be pricier than other health food stores, so make sure you know what you want, the price comparison and what you are willing to spend."}
{"text":"Big Carrot's environmentally conscious focus is great. Yes it's a couple of bux more, but they have some great and unique products. This was the only place where i could find jerusalam artichokes for example.    The store could use a little work on display considering their premium pricing.   All in all - go here for something specific, but don't go just to shop. You'll save money elsewhere for the same products."}
{"text":"Pros:  - A very wide variety of healthy food selections (organic, dairy free, low carb, gluten free...etc)  - They have a small section of ready-to-eat foods and snacks, and a hot food buffet sold by weight like Whole Foods for a quick and healthy meal!  - Place is very clean - I've been here several times, it's always kept very clean, unlike your typical grocery chains with random foods lying around  Cons:  - In my opinion, a lot of their items are quite expensive compare to some other grocery stores that carry the same items  - They carry mostly prepackaged foods, not a good selection of fresh produce  - Not so much selections on international foods - most of their items are America and European based, with a few American brand Asian foods"}
{"text":"Many years later, still pretty mediocre overall.  They focus on bringing in local and organic produce, which is great, but the prices are pretty crazy. $8 for a handful of Brussel sprouts is a bit much.  It gets really busy in here and the produce aisles get blocked pretty quickly with people double parking carts. Very stressful unless you go when it's dead.  They've implemented a mediocre points program since my last review, which is a slight improvement from no program, but it's almost insulting how terrible it is. Every time I go in I spend between $70 to $130 on groceries, and I've still only seen one or two $10 rewards since the program has been implemented. You earn 1 pt. per $0.01 spent and you get $10 off when you've reached 200,000 points. Maybe my math is off but it seems like you get $10 when you spend $2,000. You can earn more points if you bring your own bag but if you bring, let's say 4 bags, the cashiers will choose the biggest bags you brought and stuff them to the brim, squishing all your groceries in there, just so they can avoid giving you the extra points for an extra 1-2 bags. This has happened the last few times I've come here, so it seems like they may have gotten stingier recently. A reward from them is pretty unattainable. Basically a household of 1-2 people can buy groceries there for a year and only see $10-20 in rewards that year. It doesn't seem like a very good program.  Their beets are a sloppy mess sometimes, covered in mud, and you start flinging mud around when you're going through them. I had to roll up my sleeves and I still got mud all the way up to my elbows. Come on, guys, if you're charging that much for produce at least wash the mud off. Yes, I know it's organic, but come on, we aren't all hippies who like to eat dirt for its probiotics or because it's a rich source of selenium... You sell other stuff for that...  Some employees also forget to input the $2 deposit when you return milk bottles, and they need to be reminded. Seems shady.  Their prices keep going up. Fred's Bread is like $7 for a loaf of the olive bread, and the potato buns are now $2. That's quite an increase from the previous pricing, which I thought was already pretty steep. Their body care section is very expensive but they have a pretty good selection, but it seems insane that they charge upwards of $15 for deodorant. Maybe that's what it costs but the natural stuff is generally quite gross and ineffective, so the ones that actually work are closer to $20. They are usually less on Well.ca.  Sometimes you'll get a good deal on produce, but sometimes it'll be crazy expensive. It's unpredictable.  They sell containers for making your own body care products here, so that's pretty great.  They have bulk nut butters. Their macadamia nuts used to be the best I could find in Toronto but now they're just rancid like everywhere else. I guess I have to go to Australia to get good macadamia nuts because now there is officially nowhere that has fresh macadamia nuts.  They have paid parking, which is better than no parking, but not as good as free parking. Whole Foods gives you free underground parking.  Even with all my criticisms I still shop here. It's the farmers markets first and foremost, and then a tie between the Big Carrot, Loblaws, and Whole Foods if I can't get to the market (or if it's winter).  I think there's a lot of room for improvement. They have a lot of potential to be amazing. I think they should improve their points program so that customers can feel like they're going to get a reward at some point. It would be great if they didn't squish all the food into as few bags as possible to avoid giving away points. I think if another big player came in that offered organic food that seemed as independent as these guys do then they would definitely need to step up their game to not fall behind. They're pretty lucky being the only large independent organic grocery store in Toronto. There are a few small ones in Kensington (Essence of Life, Tutty Fruity) but they're even more cramped and have way less options, but their prices are definitely cheaper. If I'm wrong and they aren't the only large independent organic grocery store in Toronto, someone please educate me so that I know that I have other options!"}
{"text":"A great little store for all things Organic, and a great selection of Gluten Free items.  Prices are high, but prices for organic products are always high, you get what you pay for.  Some of the gluten free bakery items are worth the steep price, but not the Tartistry tarts... not tasty and work out to $18 a pack of 6.  I would rather make a trip to Almond Butterfly and get some fresh baked treats, not stuff that has sat in a refrigerator section for days.  Staff are helpful and for a store of it's size, a lot of check out lines, bonus."}
{"text":"Still think they need to expand their beauty/body care section. It's so cramped! I went last Saturday & the place was super busy. Not enough space for all the people that go through there. Customer service was still good this visit and selection is bigger now for cosmetics. Though they have a good sized hair care, oral care section & lots of essential oils to choose from. It's amazing how many different brands of lip balm can be found here."}
{"text":"I know, I know a lot of folks say Whole Foods is better that the Big Carrot , blah,blah,blah  but I like that the Big C is close to my hood and for other reasons too.  I am going to try to finesse and finagle reviews for both BC and WF into one,  so hang on tight.   Here are some other reasons why I like The Big Carrot over Whole Foods  1) I don't have to witness high maintenance types wearing Louboutins and YSL platforms with leather pants while they're grocery shopping for say, soy cottage cheese?  I know it's Yorkville but c'mon!  2)The service at Big Carrot has always been genuinely friendly in that smalltown, neighbourly kinda way.  At Whole Foods I find the help is  always busy, trying to look busy so they don't have to help you.   3) The Wholistic Dispensary at the Big Carrot is really charming and laid back , whereas at Whole Foods Body care dept. they follow you around like your gonna steal something when all I'm doing is reading ingredient labels dammit!  Besides how am I going to fit a tub of coconut oil into my skinny cargo pockets?   4) @ Whole Foods  This place is lurking with icky guys trying to put their theoretical from reading \"The Game\" into practice. Not to blow my horn, but one gets picked up here more than they would at a Canadian Tire!! I want to be able to fondle my produce and not have to endure stupid double entendres involving gourds okay!   Well there you have it!  The Big Carrot,  no nouveau riche poseurs, no produce perverts , just your friendly neighbourhood organic grocer!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Toronto, but when I am The Danforth is where I stay and The Big Carrot is on my list of regular haunts. I love the local products they carry such as The Millet and White Bean (gluten free) Bread from Queen Street bakery.   It's not a bargain, however, you do get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately it's not in a convenient location to me but the selection and prices are great!  Much better pricing than Whole Foods.  They have a great assortment of cosmetics too."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad. It seems like everytime I mentioned anything about \"this (any) food store on the Danforth\", the immediate reply is \"the Big Carrot?\"  Come again?  Oh, okay. The Big Carrot *is* like a more righteous version of Whole Foods. I was pretty freaked out by the fact that everything was organic, that the grapes were 5$ a pound and the bread I looked at was missing ingredients that I had believed to be necessary to make it bread (ie. flour and gluten...whatever that is). They should legally be forced to come up with another name.   Anyhow. It is a very nice and shiny and earthy (but in a shiny, man-made way) store that will presumably leaves its customers looking nice and shiny and feelin' earthy. In stores like this, I am always amazed at how calm and happy people look to be grocery shopping in places like this; the aura of pleasantness that permeates every employee, customer and earth/body-friendly item makes me wonder if organic food really is, in fact, magic food.  Certainly a different experience than the one I regularly see/get at the Dufferin Mall No Frills.  p.s. I had been wondering if Happy Planet smoothies had gone extinct, but I saw them here for the first time in ages. In GIANT SIZE, no less."}
{"text":"So I went to the Big Carrot this weekend. I started out by heading to the vegetable section of the store than making my way through the isles until I got to the meat section. Considering the store is not huge in comparison to Whole Foods, they did carry quite a few products. They had a good selection of fresh herbs and sprouts.  I purchased a few items and enjoyed browsing around in the store. I will be back when I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Great selections of everything at The Big Carrot!  I love how they have the local coffee roaster like the Birds and Beans which I have not seen a lot around Toronto.  The beauty and personal care selections are just awesome, I have to say better than Whole Food..   Staffs are super friendly.. \"Can I help you?\" I am not lost, I am just overwhelmed with the selections..  Vegan cream and lip balm? Definitely something new for me.."}
{"text":"Great selection of products and food that try to make your body a healthier one and the world a better one.  If you need gluten-free anything, the Big Carrot is your place to stock up on cereals, pastas, and all sorts of great food without that evil starch. Everything is of course, very expensive, but totally worth it if that's the kind of stuff you want or need.  As everyone has mentioned, they carry some great vegetarian and vegan products, as well as cosmetics without harmful chemicals and of course, ones that aren't tested on animals. Get your free-range chicken here so you know your chickens lived a happy life, running in fields. (I'm not being sarcastic, thinking of happy chickens makes me feel better about eating them).   Also they have AMAZING vegan cookies. They are huge, they are about $2 each, but they are so good I dream of them very often. Chocolate cookies...mmmmm.....  Anyway if you live in the area, it's a great local grocery store to grab all your organic food needs, and if you don't, it's about two seconds away from Chester station. Definitely worth the TTC fare."}
{"text":"The store has a pretty good selection of organic and alternative foods.  It has prepared food, bulk food, and packaged goods.  My main complaint is that every section seems lacking.  Go in for herbal tea, and while they have it, the selection is not fantastic.  Same with bulk food, same with dairy, etc.  Customer service ranges from friendly, to indifferent, to clueless, to pretentious.  Also tends to be pricey."}
{"text":"My grandma was the nutritional trailblazer of our family.  She was juicing before it was cool, drying flowers for her own tea, and borrowing my parents' coffee grinder for flax seeds.  She was also bringing me on trips to The Big Carrot.  I remember the smell so vividly, and the fact that her 'treat' for helping to carry her bags out to the car was always some sort of date-heavy baked good (I didn't have the heart to tell her that I hated dates).   Flash forward to today: The Big Carrot is a little out of my usual way, but I like going.  It smells the same.  It reminds me of my grandma.  And hey - what do you know - her legacy just took a while to kick in.  Now *I* love juicing, and tea, and flax and EVEN DATES!  And this is a great place to source anything I might need.   The staff is super-helpful, the range of products is really diverse for the size, and I especially appreciate the knowledge of those manning the nutritional supplements outpost: they have directed me - and my dog (holistic pup, ftw!) - to some great finds over the years.    I also love their prepared foods section.  A quick-grab lunch of a grainy salad and something from the organic juice bar?  YES'UM!  Not the most wallet-friendly choice, perhaps, but I feel good about the product and supporting The Big Carrot.    Yelp note: the flow of the store isn't the most streamlined, so I try to dodge visits during busy weekend times."}
{"text":"This is probably the best natural food store in Toronto. I go there all the time and always come out having spent far too much money than I had planned originally. Not my fault there's so much great food!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the comparisons of Big Carrot to Whole Foods (aka Whole Paycheque) - if you compare the prices, Big Carrot is slightly less expensive and the shopping experience is MUCH more enjoyable because it's less of the 'I'm vegetarian because it's trendy and I want to be a Skinny B*tch' crowd and more of the health & environment-conscious crowd that isn't overbearing and annoying to be around.   Also, the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly, plus they know their store really well and won't hesitate to help you track down what you're looking for. I haven't personally tried it but apparently they have a personal shopping service where someone can usher you around the store and show you how to shop.   And let's not forget the weekly cooking classes and demos (free on Thursday nights, otherwise you have to pay/preregister) that you can sign up for via the website. There are topics like: how to stay healthy in winter months, cooking with root vegetables, ayurvedic cooking, gluten free baking, food intolerance and organic skin care.  Be sure to check out the health & beauty division of Big Carrot which has pretty much every elixir, cream, soap (or non-soap product) and vitamin you could hope to find. And neti pots!"}
{"text":"I like this place for its vibe.  It's not just a typical grocery store, it's like a community place to shop for many organic goods.  yay: -good selection of organic (+/or) gluten-free (+/or) vegan or vegetarian goods; produce is usually fresh/fresh enough; it's cool also that they have a Nutritionist available *for free* to consult with you (in the hygiene/beauty goods section).  Make your appt with her/him in advance, so that you're not waiting too long.   Free drinking water available near the eating area.  I like the nearby stores, too.  ex: there's a rock store across from the Big Carrot.  nay: whereas in Kensington Market, you'll be paying only x amt, here at the Big C, you'll be paying more.  I guess b/c of the 'frills' -- you get more selection of organic goods, a lot is available in this one store.  One stop shopping?"}
