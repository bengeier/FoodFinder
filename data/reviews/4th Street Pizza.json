{"text":"This is now our go to pizza place. Reasonably priced, delicious pizza and the owners/employees/drivers are super friendly and delivery is quick! Just picked up some pizzas, and the guy at the counter was friendly. Great independent pizza shop.

Oh, and try the garlic vegetarian, it's amazing."}
{"text":"On short notice I had to order 16 pizza for the www.wcscalgary.com Pizza Night (our regular place would not deliver).  We were able to get our order placed, delivered on time (precisely) and the group of 100 dancers LOVED the pizzas.  They sliced it into 10 slices as we requested, regular/medium thick crust and the right amount of toppings.
WE were more than satisfied and it kept us dancing for a few more hours.
Thank you very much and we'll be calling again."}
{"text":"Really good pizza.  The place is always busy but great friendly service.  Hard to find parking for pick up, but the delivery is fast and cheap.  

Solid medium crust. Not thin and not a loaf of bread not greasy or floppy.  The toppings are fresh and great flavour in the meats.  

I like their lasagna too.  It's a solid dish packed full of sauce noodles meat and cheese. I find one order is good for two full meals and freezes well for lunches."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, hands down was one of the best but now that is long gone cause I complained one time in my many years of service about the pizza because it was not up to standard. So the next time I ordered from there it looked like somebody spit on one spot on the pizza. I will never ever order from this dump again ever again!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! We've been ordering for three years and it's always delicious!! It's fresh, the crust isn't greasy or dry, perfect! Meat lovers is our favourite."}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza place in Calgary. I had the pepperoni and cheese pizza and it had delicious chewy crust with a tangy tomato sauce. It was delivered in a timely way and was very hot."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from 4th Street Pizza for 10 years now, and the quality and preparation are fantastic. While I prefer the thin crust Napoli pizza, it really doesn't travel well for delivery. This pizza is the of thicker crust variety with lots of cheese and generous toppings.

Give the chicken artichoke as try, I personally don't like artichokes, but on this pizza they are somehow magical!

This is a true gem, family run, and you can taste the quality in their cooking."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall. 2 LG Pizza's and 4 pop for $40.00. Pizza was delicious and piping hot and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"This is the only place I was able to purchase anything at the Lilac Festival as the street was PACKED but that does not take away from how good this pizza was! I just got lucky with timing. Right off the street where they had set up, a beautiful spinach and feta pizza came out piping hot into the glass container. YUM! I was so hungry and one slice was heaven. Not too big but a decent deal at $3.50/slice. (no drink included)
I chomped so fast through this piece of hot heaven that I did not notice the feta much, or the fact that I was standing in a dusty, gravel parking lot out of the way of marching peeps OR the 125lb doberman watching me eat a foot and a half away. HA! Gooood puppy!
Will return for a whole pie next time when in the area."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Great pizza. Great sauce. Lots of toppings. One of the best in the city for Greek style. Keep your receipts you can turn them in for free pizza, nice bonus for loyalty."}
{"text":"I order from these guys once a week.  In my view this is the best delivery pizza for those of us who live in the near SW.  On top of that, they are one of the least expensive.  The quality is similar to Volos which I also like very much but they are 50% cheaper!  Takeout or delivery only.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great value and quantity, this is our frequent go-to place for pizza or pasta (lasagna or spaghetti)."}
{"text":"We walked in and were told the kitchen was 45 minutes behind and almost left... but thankfully we stayed and give this little gem a chance.  A long wait on the kitchen can sometimes kill the experience of a resturant but it barely factors on my impression now.

The decor is cool - the walls are wallpapered with an photo of Calgary by air and people have added stars to their homes.   I looked for my home but it appears I live to far away!  

Pizza stands are cans of Italian tomatoes.  Parmesan cheese comes in a grinder at your table imported from Italy like you'd find at Linas or something - so much better than a shaker!   They use Karouzo's old pizza recipes (for those Calgarians that remember the days when Karouzo himself was alive serving out the best pies in the day) and although it's not the same owners, the pizza is still very good and cutely named.   I got Popeye's mistress pizza which was good.  Yam fries were very tasty with a lemon kick to them.   I can't recall what everyone else was eating but the feedback was all thumbs up. 

It's a bit far from me and maybe not something I'd go all the way out of my way to visit - it's something I'd check out when I'm over there again!

{"text":"4th street pizza is a one floor walk up to an unassuming pizza, wings, donair and lasagne take out joint.  Its interior is decorated much like a lake cabin from the 70s, plastic flowers and that shellaced wood art that is so ugly, it is best you eat your food outside.

I was disappointed with my donair here, it cost me $6.50 for a donair and coke, I found that although they were not shy with the meat portion; it was tasteless and I didn't even finish it.  It is now just sitting in my fridge and I will only finish eating it because I don't like wasting food.  

Staff is not so friendly here, when I ordered my donair, I was not informed that they only had beef; it was assumed that is what I wanted until I asked.  There is just one table, a couple of chairs inside, and a picnic table just outside its doors.  I had problems trying to throw away my napkins and paper plate here as the trashcan was quite full. 

Would I go back probably not,  I am looking for the tasty donairs I once had in Montreal, with the most amazing tsatsiki sauce with loads of garlic and spicy tender beef, but I have yet to find it."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us and wow it did not disappoint. Ordered the Pop's Supreme. We will be making this our regular pizza place! Delivery was under a half hour and free because we live within 5kms - bonus!"}
