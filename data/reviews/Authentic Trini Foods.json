{"text":"Love, love, love this place! The food is deliciousness and more. My favourite dish is their spicy doubles. It can be greasy at times but other than that it's mouth watering! The service is very friendly and if you visit a second time they'll be sure to remember you. Prices are very very cheap and the doubles deal is a deal alright!"}
{"text":"Restaurant names can't get more straightforward.  This restaurant is a primarily takeout hole in the wall that serves up a variety of Trinidadian foods. They have roti/rice specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which is when I made my first visit.  For $5.50, I was able to get the bone-in goat roti with slight pepper (medium spice, I think?). Solid portion for the price - you will definitely be filled up after eating one of these. You can load the roti up with either potatoes or channa.  The goat portion wasn't especially plentiful, but given the price was still worth it. I've seen the full size portion of the goat roti and there's much more meat, but at $9, the price was also much higher too. Though it was bone-in goat, I only had 2 bones in the meat, and they weren't all over the place. Not annoying to work around at all. The roti was neither dry nor too oily, which is a plus.  The food I've had here thus far has been solid. I'd like to try the bake and saltfish next!"}
{"text":"At this point I'm fairly neutral. I did not like the doubles because the chick peas/channa was under cooked and hard, the bara/dough was also very tough. The boneless chicken roti was very good, but fairly spicy. At this point the Roti was a positive. But we went on a Tuesday and asked for the Tuesday Roti special to just try their food to see if we liked it... the lady behind the counter said that they were out of the smaller roti. I honestly find it very hard to believe, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt. The boneless chicken roti that we did receive was very large and could comfortably feed two people, so it was worth almost $10.  I look forward to trying other items that they have and hopefully seeing an improvement with their doubles.  Tuesday specials are always 'sold out' lol... honestly, we've tried 3x and it's always sold out. Be it 8 p.m. or 5 p.m... I had originally thought because we go so late it made sense that they're sold out, but it doesn't seem to be that."}
