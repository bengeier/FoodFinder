{"text":"I did some trade out work for Johnny's uptown for fixing his register system.  I charge $75 per hour a fairly cheap rate ($175 per hour for the geek squad).  It took me two hours to climb through all his rafters and trace down a network break.  He was fixed within 4 hours of calling me at 4 P.M.  Most places would have stuck him with a bill of over $500  for last minute and evening surcharges.  My boyfriend (Johnny's Employee) and I shared a stake and a bottle of wine.  Retail cost was $85  his employee discount made it $42.  I asked John Tallifer if he wanted me to bill him or he could trade out.  I have never seen some one gripe about saving $450 more in my life. Like an Idiot I did some newspaper ads for him 2 of them for $100  again no foresight he called me 2 hours before they were due. Then I did a sign for him for his other failing restaurant the pizza place Melrose caf I created 12 beautiful logos for his sign and a magazine made him 3 more they wanted to charge him a grand for it. He sat behind me for 4 hours and directed me how he envisioned this atrocity he had me create.  I charged him $160 he loved the sign.  I realize why straight men are not designers After 30 days of not paying me he offered, to trade out dinner for 4.  My boyfriend's uncle was in town so we went to Johnny's to eat.  My filet was fantastic; the lobster was cold, old and had been frozen before. The wine was good and the bill came to $400 well $200 for employees.  Again he bitched about saving a grand, called my partner a silly faggot and his black manager who set up the deal a stupid Nword.  My boyfriend quit and we left."}
{"text":"I can't help but wonder how Johnny's Uptown stays in business.  Mafia money?  I think so.  This place is cool.  They have great live jazz music and it's a unique place to go for dinner, drinks and dancing.   But to me, it's a little mafioso because I've never been when it's busy.  In fact, the times I've gone, I've been just about the only one in the place.  Yet, they keep on keepin' on.   Makes you wonder.  Also makes me wonder if I'm gonna be sleepin' with the fishes after writing this review.  But Johnny, if you're reading this, I love your bar/restaurant.  I do. I really do. All I'm saying is that it doesn't get that busy.  Keep in mind, I haven't been in a few months, so maybe things have livened up a bit.  I have been to their Sunday brunch too- that gets pretty busy and the food was really good. So if you're looking for something a little different to do, check out Johnny's Uptown you filthy animal."}
