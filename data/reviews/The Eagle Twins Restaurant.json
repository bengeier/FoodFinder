{"text":"Avoid the high school lunchtime crush times and the Eagle Twins is a great greasy spoon with excellent bacon, cheap egg breakfast and lunch falafel. Burger and fries are a good size and a tasty dinner option.   Open on Saturday as an excellent fast alternative to expensive, slow, ho hum food in crowded nearby St.Clair diner standards.  Dingy yes. Tasty yes. Cheap yes. Wonderful neighbourhood family running the joint.   Just wish the coffee was tastier but you can't have everything in one place I guess. High schoolers know their tasty foods."}
{"text":"You get what you get here. Cheap prices decent food and quick service.  I love it!"}
{"text":"I can't recommend or rave about this place enough. The owners are extremely warm and welcoming and truly show what real customer service is about. The food portions are ridiculously large for the price!   I'm a regular here for a reason and highly highly highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"OK, I've decided.  It is very dingy.  Repaint, and I'll reconsider."}
{"text":"Got brunch here by chance on my trip in Toronto. It's a small place with some pretty basic choices for food. I had a little trouble deciding what to get and ended up choosing something I saw someone else order.   What I ordered: 1.  Chicken shawarma    My thoughts: 1. Chicken Shawarma - hands down best shawarma I've ever had. It was so simple and well made. And I think I'm not trying to over complicate the recipe it made it even better.  Would I go back: I would go back for the shawarma . My family ordered other items on the menu that were decent but nothing special. The place also needs a little cleaning up. But for the shawarma alone I would go back because it was that good ."}
{"text":"Love this place. Breakfast was amazing. Great prize. I go every Tuesday.  Very nice mom and pops shop. burgers are great. I keep coming back for their home fries give it a chance."}
{"text":"A little hole-in-the-wall cafe/diner with the grill at the front and a TV with the news channel on in the back. Sedara and I got burgers and Jessy got a  Mediterranean plate. The food came out quickly, was really good, generous portions, and dirt cheap. I'm glad we stumbled across this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food lots of different types of food to order and great pricing, and great service for just two people"}
{"text":"Fly Eagle Twins, fly!   I had a delicious breaded chicken burger and a side salad. Nice and cheap here, and it's a mish-mashy dive-y diner, which I dig. The chicken burger was frozen, but that didn't make it any less tasty. The side salad was simple and drenched in dressing... totally reasonable.   I look forward to returning and trying one of their breakfasts. Diner breakfasts are the. best.   PEPPER'S PISSED: High School Students tend to descend here right at noon, so try to be earlier or later if school is in session. I have nothing against youth (most of the time I behave like one), but the sheer size of their packs can be overwhelming."}
