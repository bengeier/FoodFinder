{"text":"This was recommended to us by several people so we figured it had to be good. Aside from the manager that came by to check on us, not a single employee smiled. The bartenders actually rolled their eyes at us and walked away instead of serving us. Waitress was annoyed with the fact that we were ordering a bunch of appetizers instead of dinners. They weren't prepared at all to handle the volume of a sold out concert despite sitting in the shadow of Heinz Field. How do you not know there's a concert going on and prepare accordingly? I know that you are in the service industry and things can get hectic, however you need to at least smile or act like you'd like to work there. Extremely disappointing service, I would never recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"My mom and I were spending a girl's night out and decided to check out this restaurant prior to the Pirate game.  We planned ahead and got in line via No Wait, as I anticipated this being a popular spot on a Friday night.  We arrived at the restaurant and I checked in as the app instructed me to do.  The hostesses seemed overwhelmed already (it was only 5 pm) and not one of them politely greeted us.  One asked me if I selected indoor, outdoor or no preference when I registered online.  I said, I'm sorry I didn't as that wasn't an option when I got in line.  She looked super annoyed, rolled her eyes and said, \"That's what I'm asking you.\" So I apologized again (something wrong with this picture here...) and requested outside.  At that point, there were four parties ahead of us.  We waited another 15 minutes before our table was ready.  Once we were alerted, I returned to the hostess desk, informed them that my table was ready.  At this point, there were 4 employees standing at the desk, not busy serving other customers.  One said, you have to now check in with the outside host desk.  Having never been there before, I did not know where that was exactly, so I asked if someone could show us.  One employee, also seemingly annoyed (I'm sensing a pattern here...), lifted his arm and literally pointed at the front door.  Incredulous, I said I needed someone to physically show me the way - not point outside.  We were then  directed outside to the appropriate area, and the next hostess was far friendlier and lead us promotly to our table.  

The table wasn't actually ready, as there was still debris and remnants from the previous diners.  So the hostess bussed the table and we settled in.  At this point, it was 1 hour and 45 minutes prior to the start of the game - plenty of time to enjoy the beautiful weather.  We were greeted fairly promptly by our waitress, she was very friendly, and our drink orders were taken.  We acknowledged that we were going to the game.  It took a solid 15 minutes for her to return with our drinks and take our dinner order.  She apologized for the wait, and we said no problem because at the point we had the whole night ahead of us.  That turned out to be the shortest wait of the evening.  And our waitress became less pleasant and present from that point forward.

We ordered three apps total and a salad.  Our first two appetizers arrived 30 minutes later (?!) and at that point our glasses were bone dry.  We asked for water, which took another 15 minutes.  It's important to note that while the restaurant was somewhat busy, not all of the tables were occupied in our area and it appeared to be well staffed.  

It took another 35 minutes to receive our dinner (remember a salad and an appetizer of tacos), and we were starting to get very annoyed.  My mom's salad came without dressing, so the waitress went back to retrieve it.  Not sure if she got lost, but that took an unnecessarily long time as well.  Unfortunately, the game was fast approaching, so we hurriedly ate (not at all how we envisioned this going) and asked for the check.  We also asked for a take out box, as the portions were very generous.  Our waitress served two tables, going in and out, before finally bringing us our check. Guess what, no box.  She served two more tables, in and out, before taking our check and bringing boxes.  At this point, we were 5 minutes from game time, very frustrated and certainly not relaxed.  

The food at Jerome Bettis Grille 36 was tasty and generously portioned.  However, the staff was hugely disappointing from the moment we walked in to the moment we hurriedly rushed out.  Despite being well staffed, it appeared disorganized and poorly managed.  The host staff was incredibley rude and the wait staff was not attentive or responsive to our very basic needs.  I will not return to this restaurant for future pre-game meals, nor would I recommend it to anyone interested in spending their time wisely.  

Jerome - the city loves you and we are proud of you, but your restaurant staff is letting you down.  I can't imagine these are your standards and you are going to need to act quickly to turn this around before the next influx of sports fans unknowingly settles in."}
{"text":"This place was great!!! The food was very good. There not cheap on there portions either !! The atmosphere was great, during and not during game times. 
We stayed there for three days, and we ate there every night. You got to have the nachos!!! They are very large. You got to try Iron City Beer. I'm a big beer drinker, and I love this beer.

You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This review is with respect to the carrot cake, only: It's pretty awesome.  For $9 you get enough cake to feed 4 normal people, or maybe 2 happily indulgent people.  Either way, gigantic chunks of walnuts, and tasty cream cheese frosting makes for a happy camper in my books.  Yum."}
{"text":"This is a really great place to eat. Very clean reasonable prices & the portions are huge. The staff is friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"Been here several times. I am not a drinker, here for food. Decent size serving. The slice of carrot cake was humongous! It was very good non the less."}
{"text":"The food is average and the service is slow.  The ambiance is awesome,  it's not enough to cover for the slow service though.  Try the deep fried burger,  and a Boilermaker,  you won't be disappointed. But don't plan on getting out quickly. They are slow."}
{"text":"Every time I come into town this is a must stop for me.  The drinks are great and it always has a nice friendly crowd before and after sporting events.  Total thumbs up in my book."}
{"text":"Had a very poor experience there related to customer service. 

Arrived to to get seating for a large table at 12:30pm.  They said they would not take names and hold tables. There were limited large tables open at that time, but only two of eight in our party had arrived so they wouldn't seat us.  We mentioned our party was expected around 1.  Around 1 they started a wait list and were not helpful when we asked to be listed on it.  They had not looked to save any large tables or opportunities to hold our group and were very rude when we asked again to try and be seated.  The rest of our party showed by 1:15 and it included 3 kids. At that time, there was nowhere for us to sit.   By 2pm, they had not followed up with us at all or tried to be courteous.  In fact, they were very unprofessional during the entire process.  I complained to the management since they \"had no idea\" about how long it would be to try and seat us. While I waited for more than an hour, they still made no effort to hold smaller tables open to try and accommodate our party.  By just after 2pm we said we were leaving and they seemed shocked.  Was also very frustrated the manager did not really try to solve any issues and help us out.  

I didn't even get to eat there but my co-workers had lunch there other days and said their meals were \"OK.\" 

They need to improve their approach to seating and customer service.  If they would have been more accommodating we would have been a large party with huge orders.  Instead, they ruined our day and their reputation among a large group of potential customers."}
{"text":"Upscale atmosphere, great selection of adult beverages and great food. Boneless wings are some of the best I have had. The Asian chicken salad was awesome."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved to Pittsburgh, all the way from Montana.  We were having lunch at Jerome Bettis Grille 36, and we asked our bartender, Matt, if there was any chance they would be showing the Montana State / Stony Brook playoff game later that night.  As Montana State alumni (Go Cats!), we are big fans, but being this far away from home, we didn't figure there was any way we would be able to see the game.  If so, our plan was to return later that evening to hang out and watch the game.  Matt went above and beyond to make sure that their AV guy, Taylor, would be able to put the game on for us.  Not only that, but Matt knew that he would be off his shift when we returned.  So he talked to the other bartenders that were coming on duty that evening - Dave, Nick, and Sean - to make sure they knew to expect us.  Sure enough, when we walked in later that evening, Dave remembered us, and had them turn the game on for us.  Not only that, but the manager on duty came up to us and asked if  everything was ok for us, and if the TV that they were showing it on was close enough.  Awesome!  PLUS, the AV guy - Taylor - stopped by where we were sitting and asked if we could see the feed clearly enough.  We definitely could.  Long story short....  The service was phenomenal!  Thank you to everyone - Matt, Dave, Nick, Sean, Taylor, and the manager on duty the afternoon and evening of 12/1/12 (sorry - we didn't get your name!).  All of you made 2 people who are a long way from home not only feel welcome, but right at home.  We are impressed, and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been in a few years and happened to be back in town with my fianc√©. After walking around the point - we headed over for lunch. 

We were seated quickly, our server Cory was friendly, attentive, and very helpful! Our food was delicious (burger & shrimp tacos) It was a beautiful day to sit outside - their outside patio is in a great spot. 

We will definitely be back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Came in last night and our bar tender Chris was the best. Service was five star.  Had the shrimp tacos they were very good. So got up this afternoon and went back. The bar tender was different but still a five star server. Didn't have to ask for a refill was their when I needed it. Also had the fish tacos again. Will be coming back to Pittsburgh just to come here and I'm from Dayton Ohio. Much love"}
{"text":"Atmosphere. That's what this place has. If you want to go to a top notch sports bar, Jerome Bettis Grille is the place in Pittsburgh.

An excellent bar, with over 30 beers on tap,many being craft beers. Big selection of liquor and a good wine selection. The bartenders are awesome, very attentive and quick. 

Lots of tv's to watch your favourite sports events. The lounge and patio are spacious with both lots of standing and sitting room.

The restaurant has lots of seating and wonderful food.  The menu has a great variety of choices to please all palates.  You have to definitely try the deep fried pretzels...they are amazing!!  If you're up for the challenge, try the 36....and kudos to you if you finish it.

There were a few reviews that said the food here was 'pub' style.  We thought the food was definitely a few notches above that.  We all had something different and the food was fabulous.

We will be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The wait was almost 2 hrs. But the service was decent. The food may have been alright but they got my order wrong. The environment is nice."}
{"text":"Even though I'm not a football fan (sorry!), I ended up having the greatest lunch here.

Whatever you do, start with the pretzels! They were out of this world. Enough said. Just do it.

I went for the Sesame Ginger chicken salad, and I don't regret it. A little spicy, a little juicy and a bunch of green goodies - this lunch was exactly what I wanted. Would not mind going here for dinner, I'd love to try out some of the beers they have here. There is a lot to choose from. 

The whole place was neat and clean (restrooms, too), pretty good for a sportsbar! It left me impressed."}
{"text":"Was enjoying a summer day, listening to an outdoor concert at stage AE and decided to move over and sit outside of JBG and have some cocktails and appetizers with a friend. The service was wonderful, very polite host and our server was very helpful and fun. The food for the price is where I had issues. I had 3 beers (draft selection was pretty decent) but at 8$ a pop for each one (all different) was a bit much. 
Food wise:
started with the spinach artichoke dip...a little too creamy, but still good. 
Continued on with the short rib tacos which were maybe the worse tacos of my life. cold tortilla, little meat, and dry slaw mix. nothing at all interesting and certainly not worth the like 13$. I had to put the leftover spinach artichoke dip on top to give it any moisture. still only finished 1. 

So, location is great...food is meh...prices are as high, but service was wonderful. Won't be going back though"}
{"text":"Went here with my ten month old and wife.  We thought was just a tourist trap type of place but it really surprised me! I love the combination of foods they have. Very good place and great service !

Actually went there twice during our four night stay in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I was a bit nervous to eat here since I have heard bad things about this place, but we decided to eat here before the death cab for cutie show. And I must say it was pretty good. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich which was good and had a few bites of the deep fried hoagie, also good. They had 2.50 dos equis which is a great price. I think they were 20 oz.? We all got the artichoke dip before hand. Big pieces of artichokes. Plus, you gotta love that when you take a piss, there is a 2 way mirror while doing so. Cant say I ever pissed and looked at people sitting at a bar before...well at least that I can remember. I might even consider watching a pittsburgh stinker game here this year"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch while out doing the tourist thing. I thought there would be more memorabilia, not as crazy as a hard rock but something. 
They have some funky burgers, with funky meats and one that's coated in tempura batter and deep fried! 
Menu is pretty big with a nice selection of salads, soups and flatbread sandwiches, as well as apps and meals 
Hubby had the Turkey Devonshire 7.99 lunch special, 
grilled turkey, garlic mashed potatoes and buttermilk biscuits, topped with smoked bacon, cheddar jack cheese, and a parmesan cheese sauce, which he liked and was a good meal for a cold, rainy day. 

I had the Kobe burger 11.99, ordered medium, came well done but it was still good, came with purple potato chips and a parmesan dip/sandwhich spread that was really good. If we come back I'm getting the Ultimate Mac and Cheese 

They have a really nice cocktail menu and my Tropicotton cotton candy martini was awesome! A+ 

Oh, and my Hub also liked being able to look at the whole restaurant through a one way glass while he was peeing. Men..."}
{"text":"Great place. Love going in to see the people I know who work there. The food is very good and another great location in the Burgh."}
{"text":"Love the Grille!  The Cedar Plank Salmon is great and the burgers are awesome. The manager and staff are always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"So we came here because you just \"have to\" when visiting Pittsburgh. It was a total let down and just horrible food! We had the nachos that the the waitress said they were \"famous\" for. I can make better nachos myself. If I hadn't had ranch to douse them in, they would have been inedible. The beer was warm. Just overall not a great experience and very sad that I had to rate it so low."}
{"text":"really cool place, down the street from heinz field.  huge bar on the inside, really large patio seating and the mensroom had a cool one-way mirror so you're lookin out into the restaurant while u pee.

huge menu with a lot of different choices.  some dishes have a 36 logo next to it signifying it was one of bettis' favorites.  so based on that, i chose the turkey burger since i actually never had one before.  i will never get it again.  it looked terrible when the waitress brought it over and it tasted terrible.  made me really question the bus' taste.

but the wings were really good.  my coworkers all ordered salads or wraps which looked pretty good.  they also have a good selection of beers and that day the special beer was $2.25 for a 20oz glass, which they said was pretty good (i didn't drink).

overall, a decent spot, but i'll just try somethin other than the turkey burger next time i go."}
{"text":"I came here because of good reviews and the fact I'm from out of town. I asked the waitress if I could get a burger without a bun, because I have Celiac disease. She informed me they had a gluten free menu! I was ecstatic that they had gluten free buns. I ordered a burger with the gluten free bun. We finally got our food and when I got mine I asked again if it was gluten free, the waitress confirmed yes. After I ate half the burger I was suspicious of the bun since it tasted too good. I asked the waitress again and she had it remade. It came back on a completely different bun. The one I received first was NOT gluten free. I immediately knew I was going to be sick. I told the waitress and she apologized. I got my bill and she still charged me for the burger. I honestly didn't eat any of the new burger because I felt so sick. After I explained to the waitress I thought it was ridiculous that I had to pay for a meal that I ate half of and was going to make me sick for days, she took it off. Just disappointed that they advertise gluten free buns and can't even make sure they give the customers the right ones."}
{"text":"Terrible experience yesterday Dec 27.  Arrived at Bettis' at about 1:25 pm.  (Know this because paid to park for 90 min at meter at 1:20). We had a group of six including 74 year old disabled mother and my brother's family visiting from Florida.  Not crowded at all as it was mid-afternoon on a Tuesday.  There was only one group in front of us , yet we waited over fifteen minutes to be seated and this despite the fact there were empty tables available on the riverview side.  Hostess claimed they didnt have enough servers in that section, so we had to wait for someone to leave on the streetside.  After viewing a quick table top wet towel smear, we were finally seated at that table.   Noticed that the carpeted floors were disgusting throughout the room...food all over them.

After almost 10 min the waitress breezed by us and said \"i'll be right with you\".  Never saw her again.  After another 10 minutes a couple from next table advised, \"you seem like nice people...take our advice and get out while you can.\"  They said that they had long wait on a table, long wait to place order, long wait to get food, no service after food arrived, and yes, even a long wait to get their check.  They had been there well over an hour and a half. We thanked them and decided to leave.  Another table saw us leaving and they too left.  

As we were leaving, a young man appeared and asked what he could offer us to stay.  He began providing rationalizations as to why the service was so poor and actually followed me all the way to the door asking if we wanted a different table.  We asked if we could get better service, to which he had no response.  He then actually offered us coupons for our next visit.  Really?  We came in for a meal, not charity.   Won't be visiting again.  

We had an excellent customer service experience across the street at Burgatory.   BTW, thanks to the Bettis team, i also had to leave that meal to go back out to the car to feed the parking meter."}
{"text":"We went in on a Thursday at 7:30 PM and the place was a little dead on the inside, and the patio had about 15-20 people sitting outside eating.  The wait staff acted like they were slammed and took forever to give us menus, take our order, refill drinks, bring the check, etc.  My friend's wife ordered Sangria and said it tasted like they gave her pineapple juice that they had dyed with another juice to make it look like sangria.  She knows her wine, so I am sure she knew what she was talking about.  She actually returned the drink and ordered something else, and it took like 10 minutes to get her 2nd order which was just a glass of white wine!  Also when we first went into the restaurant, the host and hostess at the table just stood and looked at us like we were intruding.  It took them a couple minutes to greet us and ask if we wanted to be seated!  Moral of the story:  Get your shit together, Bettis Grille.  Maybe Jerome needs to check in on you more often."}
{"text":"Sports! Big Screens! Dj! Tater tots! More places should offer tater tots!!! Food and drinks were good. Bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers delicious. Our food came quickly, and was hot. Overall it was really good. The only reason I'm not rating a 5 is the hostess seating us wasn't especially nice, tho the waitress was great. The food was all delicious, but our \"medium\" burger was brought out \"well done\"."}
{"text":"Food: The menu offers pretty much exactly what you would expect Jerome Bettis himself to eat, a lot of meat and hearty sides, but also features a surprising number of vegetarian choices for a grill owned by a former NFL player as robust as The Bus.  Carnivores will have no problem finding something that sounds good on the menu, and I'm sure the food is up to par with any other steakhouse its size and scale.  Some menu items are noted with a \"36\" as \"Jerome's favorites\" (hint: Jerome does not prefer vegetables), while others are noted with a differently colored \"36\" to show that they are vegetarian.  Those items include a homemade veggie burger, gnocchi, linguini, salads, and a handful of appetizers.  We ordered the hummus, which was pretty bland and had almost no flavor.  Unlike most restaurants, which load you up on hummus and skimp on the pitas, Bettis does the opposite, providing a mound of pitas and a less hummus than you would expect.  We each ordered the homemade veggie burger, which was impressive as a concept (for this type of restaurant), but Jerome needs to talk to some of his vegetarian NFL friends (Tony Gonzalez, Arian Foster) and revamp this burger.  It had little flavor and a sloppy texture and had standard, bland toppings like onion, a massive leaf of lettuce, and a slice of tomato.  The strawberry cilantro dressing sounded great but was barely noticeable.  The best part of the meal was the huge pile of sweet potato waffle fries that came as a side.  We didn't order dessert after being underwhelmed by our dinner.

Price: Jerome has to pay the bills for this amazing location (see below), but the prices are generally fair.  This isn't a cheap meal, but not expensive either.  Appetizers range from $6-13, and sandwiches or entrees range from $10-19 (except for the $54 36 oz. steak).  The special cocktails are a little pricy but there is a full bar with cheaper cocktails and at least one beer special which is more affordable.

Drinks: The bar is the Grille's strongest feature.  There is a huge list of draft and bottled beers, an extensive wine list, a full-service bar and specialty cocktail list, and even IBC Root Beer and Red Bull.  We tried a special cocktail, The Jolly Roger, which wasn't cheap but was made strong and was pretty tasty, before switching to one of the many beer options.

Atmosphere: The restaurant aspect is pretty standard with large and small tables, indoor and outdoor seating, televisions playing sports, and music blasting.  The bar is a huge oval with many seats, a lot of fast-moving bartenders, and even more TVs playing almost any live sporting event that you'd want to see.  The entire place is littered with signed notes on the walls from former Steelers and famous athletes.  Just reading these notes, if you're a sports fan, will keep you busy throughout dinner.  If you're like me, and the Steelers are almost as important as your family, you'll want to try this place once and will probably be somewhat biased in a positive way, like the homer that you are on Sunday afternoons.  The men's restroom has the now famous two-sided mirror that looks out into the bar and front door of the restaurant, which is a unique perspective while relieving your bladder.  Due to its proximity to Heinz Field and Stage AE, the place gets super busy before a big event.  It was packed when we went, but we only had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table for two.  The bar fills up quickly, but there are enough bartenders to get a drink without too long of a wait.  This is probably a good place to watch a game, but is much busier and more frantic than your neighborhood pub.

Service: Everyone was friendly and efficient, particularly the bartenders.  Despite being slammed before a concert at Stage AE, the bartenders were hustling to get everyone drinks fast.  We didn't wait long for a table, put in our order quickly, and had quick refills on waters and drinks.  

(+): awesome location, plenty to drink, owned by a legendary former Steeler

(-): average food, lacks the authenticity of a smaller bar/restaurant, nothing special

Would I go back again? If I had tickets to a show at Stage AE or a game at Heinz Field and forgot beers for tailgaiting at home or it was raining, probably.  Sorry Jerome; watching highlights of thunderous runs with tacklers bouncing to the turf gives me goosebumps, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to come here for the generic food on just any old night."}
{"text":"We stopped in for appetizers with friends.  The service was very good and our server Bryan made some excellent recommendations.  We had the tot cho's which were a very good version of nachos, but with crispy tater tot base, the bacon wrapped jalape√±os were excellent as were the sliders with a side of Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, a great place to go before any Pittsburgh sporting event.  We have been there 3 times,  and never have had an issue.  The dry rub wings are out of this world.  I ate there with a champion wing maker.  He made fun of me for ordering the dry rub wings.  However, he ate half of my dozen and started on his own dry rub when we returned home.  Tbe Barnyard burger is up there with the best burgers I ever had.  I would have given it a 5 star rating, but the prices are a little high.  Not high enough to keep me from going,  But high enough to limit my trips."}
{"text":"Not too bad. Our server was lovely and the setting was really great! Outdoors, by the river, with fairy lights hanging... beautiful! I ordered the linguini bruschetta pasta and asked for no cheese, but it came with cheese. I didn't send it back because it took so long to arrive the first time, so I ate around it. Also, the balsamic glaze was far too overpowering so I had to eat around that, too. What I did eat was nice, though, and my boyfriend enjoyed his meal! I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Diners go to restaurants so that they can become involved in the personal lives of the people who work there, and this restaurant excels at creating and sharing that experience! And every once in a while the staff bothers to be interrupted to find out what a diner wants and if everything is okay. What more could you ask for? A cooked steak, for one. I asked for medium rare, and I got a raw slab of meat with score marks on each side. The waitress sided with the cook, until I insisted that medium rare still meant cooked. The vegetable...well, the menu had promised a seasonal vegetable of zucchini, squash, peppers, and onions, and once I pointed this out to her, she had the stalk of broccoli that the chef had plated next to the mooing steak removed and brought me the promised side dish--about ten minutes before she returned with a slightly overcooked steak.  Broccoli...mixed vegetables...honoring what's promised on the menu. Why be so picky? It's the hip place to be! You can listen to the staff's preferred choice of music and hear about their social lives at the same time! I won't be back."}
{"text":"I went here before a Pirates game and was a little disappointed, both with the pirates and the restaurant.  I love wedge salads and order them anytime they are on the menu.  This particular salad was $8, so I knew it was gonna be big which was ok since I was planning on splitting it.  Well, it was literally a head of lettuce with dressing drizzled over it.  As you might imagine, a coating of dressing over 1 piece of lettuce is not enough for an entire head of lettuce.  The burger I shared was ok, a little undercooked, not the best.  Our waiter brought us the wrong beer, so we got to keep the mistake for free which I guess makes up for the bad wedge salad.  

The menu had a good selection of food.  Mostly burgers.  Everything was presented very nicely.  We sat outside along the river which was ok except it got a little windy and my poor mother had to sit in the sun since our table seemed to be the only one without an umbrella.  

Oh, and the bathrooms in this joint were so dark!  I had to paw my way around to get where I wanted to go.  This makes me wonder what they are trying to hide. Hmmmmmmm......"}
{"text":"As a diehard Steelers fan, it pains me to give this place one star, but this was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.

My friend absolutely adores the chocolate cake at this place, so when we were in town for a football game, we thought we'd eat dinner there. Upon entering, the hostess told us it would be an hour and a half wait. It was packed, the night before a Steelers game, so we had expected as much. No big deal. We put our name on the list and went to find seats at the bar.

Upon sitting down at the bar, it took us 25 minutes until the bartender came over to see us. I know they were busy, but it took us nearly a half hour to just get water. We had to resort to flapping our arms to get the bartender's attention.

It was another 20 minutes before we were able to get the bartender's attention - again by flapping our arms - to order drinks.

After almost an hour of waiting, we finally had drinks, and the next half hour passed by rather pleasantly, although we were again completely ignored by the bartender.

After an hour and a half, I went to check with the hostess, who told me it was going to be an additional two hour wait for a table. I told her she had originally told us 90 minutes, but she just shrugged. There's a big difference between an hour and a half wait, and a three and a half hour wait.

Now with both of us a little mad, my friend and I decided to just eat dinner at the bar. We ordered, then proceeded to wait nearly an hour for our food. If it was just me, I would have been long gone, but my friend wanted to stay, so I put up with it.

When my burger did finally arrive, it was ice cold. My friend told me to send it back, but at this point I was upset and hungry and said it was fine. (My mistake!)

Once again having to wave our arms to get the bartender's attention, we ordered dessert, the fabled chocolate cake my friend insisted I had to try. We once again waited 45 minutes, which at this point had become par for the course, only for someone to come out and tell us they had dropped the chocolate cake on the floor and didn't have any more. So I never even got to taste the whole reason my friend and I went to the restaurant.

To add insult to injury, a manager came out and said she wouldn't charge us for the chocolate cake, as if they were actually thinking about charging us for something they had never served us.

Four hours after we walked in the front door, we left the restaurant with no apology, no comped drinks, nothing.

And did I enjoy the Steelers game the next day? No, I did not. I made it through about a quarter and a half before I was in the bathroom puking. When I got home and saw my doctor, he said the most likely cause was food poisoning caused by undercooked meat.

Needless to say, I will never be returning here."}
{"text":"I just love this place! I have been there many times and its always been very good. The atmosphere is great especially if your a sports nut. Plenty of TV's, great food and an endless list of beers."}
{"text":"Unbelievably Mediocre. I believe I did not get the correct thing off the menu, however the party of seven I was with gave similar opinions."}
{"text":"Good spot to grab a drink before the game. Beer prices are reasonable considering the proximity to Heinz Field. Service is slow when ordering drinks at the bar, not sure about table service as I haven't used it."}
{"text":"I hope Jerome Bettis is reviewing, step your customer service up ASAP!  I do not want to know that the bartender \"gets moody\" when I've asked for bar specialty shot. If I want to spend money on booze and food for a steeler game, sadly it will not be here ever again. The staff feed on the busy entrance, communicating to the prospective customers a 2+hour wait- please know it took us 20 minutes to be seated at a table on game day. horrible. Jerome come check your staff and please train out waitress Alisha. P.s who serves crown and pitrone warm?!?!"}
{"text":"My husband & I were hesitant because of our boys.
It turned out we loved it. The food was delicious,  great service & beautiful view. The waitress let my kids go in into the little private room with all the Jerome Bettis memorabilia. Its was cool. They have really good martinis!  Spinach dip...best ever!"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow at the bar but it was a Sunday evening. Great Big Screen televisions with good visibility  from all areas of the bar. Food was good though! Kind of a unique menu with some homemade options."}
{"text":"I went to a party at the Bettis grill we had a reserved area and was to have staff available. Well theres was non exsistant service after 30 minutes I went to the bar to get a water. It took another hour to find anyone to take an order which I just left & went somewhere else. My food was dry, cold, over cooked  & not done as I ordered it. The Jerome burger came out almost burnt, cold & missing all toppings. My other order was also cold but looked greasier than a turkey burger should. It was also missing the sweet potato fries what I got was some over seasoned old fries. Again it was done done as I expected it to be, what a big let down.

Then to top it off I pay the waiter and wait & wait for my change guess what no can find the waiter. He took off with my money, I looked for him for over half an hour for him never saw him again. Funny I was going to give him a bigger tip than wat he stole!

So if your down with terrible service, ordinary over priced food & thief for waiter then this is the place for you. I'll never waster my money again & make sure I spread the word about the thief."}
{"text":"Food is amazing.  Tried the mac and cheese, best I've had in a while.  Fun place to watch games, or pre-game for a Steelers or Pirates game."}
{"text":"with all due respect - this is not my type of place to frequent: Nice place, clean,  upscale sports bar with a dining area. The popularity of other local venues keep them alive in my opinion. This place would have to step its game up significantly if it were in any other location- nothing really jumped out at me.  the staff is awesome; friendly and informative."}
{"text":"Meh...was expecting higher than average sports bar fare but was disappointed. Staff was friendly and service was okay. We tried a few appetizers and entrees and noticed the lack of fresh ingredients and overcooked or undercooked meals. Great location but c'mon BUS!  You can do better."}
{"text":"I'm never coming here again. I am writing this as we are here. We are a large group at a high table in the bar area. We told the server that we would take care of her because we would be here all evening to watch the STANLEY CUP FINAL. She barely showed up. Service was so bad, we gave up on her and just ordered from the bar. 

The absolute worst part, though, is the DJ. They have the TV volume turned off when the puck is not in play, and instead some idiot DJ who clearly has never watched a single game of hockey is blathering on and on, reminding us that we are watching the Penguins play a game. A lot of people were expressing their displeasure over the fact that we couldn't hear any of the pregame commentary. One of our party found a manager and asked that they put the TV volume on, and the answer he got was, \"We turn off the DJ when the puck drops. That's just how we do it here.\" Idiots. Idiots. Idiots. They are absolutely killing the atmosphere. 

I thought this place was annoying during football games with the DJ coming on during every commercial, but this is beyond the pale. Seriously, never again. If I could give zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Great service, clean, unique atmosphere, and extra bonus for the men who need to use the restroom. ;-)   I got the turkey burger, and it was quite possibly the best I've ever had... seriously.   Also got wings that were tasty.  Not terribly pricey.   Definitely recommend this place if you are downtown."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and food was delicious!! My husband loved the fried Italian hoagie."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere

Nice bar area to dine  for a quiet afternoon after the Heinz field tour.  outside seating by water also great to have if weather was nice.   

To the food

Korean BBQ tacos not up to par.  Beef ok but too thick like skewers of beef instead of true Korean bulgoki.  The best part was the side salad with a kick o wasabi in sweet dressing.

Turkey Parmesan burger was great.  Big piece of meat. A good 1/3 of pound it seems made like a pizza burger.  Sauce was great and they did not overstuffed it with mozzarella.  Great dish around the bar."}
{"text":"At first I  was a bit duds appointed that they were our of many items 
your waitress was incredible and the marighirrsa even better"}
{"text":"4 stars. Cool sports bar in between PNC Park and Heinz Field. This place quiet possibly has one of the coolest bathrooms ever (you will have to experience it for yourself). Ordered a couple of IC lights before the Pirates game."}
{"text":"We went here and I couldn't decide what to get! We ended up with the deep fried pretzels, (while awesome, way too big of a serving for 2), and I got the deep-fried cheeseburger. It was the Best. Cheeseburger. of . My. Life!!!
Prices were surprisingly low considering it's downtown on the river.
The wait wasn't great, but it was a Saturday around dinner-time with a Dave Matthews Concert down the street... So I wasn't shocked at our 25 minute wait.
Service was fantastic. The server admitted to being new, but still blew me away. 
I will definatly go back, just to try the things I didn't get last time."}
{"text":"Got here about 3 hours before game time and were able to sit right now at the bar.   Ordered an appetizer with plans to order a main course later. After a long wait - they brought us the wrong appetizer.

Had to wait a while for the right one and when it came finally got to order our main meal.  Got the signature 36 burger.

Over 45 minutes later it arrived... Cold.  No one asked how it was or how we were doing.

The burger and fries tasted like Applebee's quality but cold. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Visiting the city for a pre-season Steelers game, we had to stop here for dinner. I'm glad we did. Friendly waitstaff, pleasant atmosphere (not loud, maybe that's in the bar, where you would expect it to be loud), good food. I had the chicken quesadilla, which was prepared differently than I am used to but I loved it.  I didn't think it was expensive at all as some other reviewers thought but, hey, I'm visiting from metro NY so perhaps my expectations are different."}
{"text":"Waiter was absolutely adorable and super nice, oir drinks and refills were so quick. Great staff. But the pasta primavera was overcooked and mushy."}
{"text":"They have a pretty wide menu, but it's generally a more unhealthy fare, such as the deep-fried Italian hoagie. The turkey burger is pretty good. Portion size is good, and it's more likely you'll leave stuffed than hungry. Service is horrible. We waited 40 minutes for food and they weren't even that busy."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I love it. The beer selection is endless and the food is good. The only reason that I'm giving the Bus 4 stars is only because my favorite dish \"the blackened tuna\" is no longer on the menu which is very disappointing to me. Other than that it is a fantastic place to eat, hang out and watch a game."}
{"text":"Fantastic Bartenders, the best in Pittsburgh.  Amanda is the best. Dave, Julia, and Marybeth are fantastic. Missy is always ready to serve, Only complaint is Julia is waiting on tables instead of serving at the bar."}
{"text":"After a horrible experience 3 months ago we decided we would try again.... Once again we left disappointed.  The fortunate thing was that we didn't waste our time sitting down.  We showed up and the dining room was half full, at best, we were told that it would be a 30-35 minute wait!!  I asked why, when the dining room was empty, and we were told that they were seating all of those table soon..  Only a handful of people were outside and the bar was empty.  I am sure the issue was that they were highly understaffed both from a server and kitchen perspective.  I am sure this place will be out of business once Burgatory, Toby Keith and North Park Lounge open up.  So if you want to eat there.... save your money!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe there would be another star if I had actually gotten to eat my dinner at the restaurant. 

We picked this place because we were staying in the area and their menu had a variety of items.  We ordered one gourmet Mac n cheese, an 8oz sirloin, and a burger.

The food showed up about 25 minutes later, after we waved down the puzzled looking person holding what appeared to be our order.

The side of broccoli ordered with the mac consisted of two small pieces. With the steak, which was supposed to be served with 'seasonal vegetables' - a squash medley, was served with a crown of broccoli.  Not cut apart or anything, and barely cooked. Unfortunately it was served to someone who can't eat broccoli and was expecting the vegetable that was listed on the menu. The seasonal veggies were a mushy mess of onions, peppers, and a few pieces of zucchini. Not a great start.

The person who delivered the food went back to request a different veggie for the steak. We disintegrated let him take the rest of the plate, which ended up being a good thing because it gave us a chance to check the steak.

Steak was ordered medium well, sight pink. What came was tough, burnt, and brown all the way through. Finally flagged down a waiter and sent back the steak plate. The only thing on the plate that seemed correct was the sweet potato fries

The manager came and apologized, promising an 8-minute wait. 15 minutes later, after everyone else was done, we still didn't have a steak. Flagged down the waiter (where was he????) and asked for the check. After the check arrived (excluding the missing steak), a to go box arrived with the steak. We left and headed for the hotel.

Cut into the steak, and it was barely medium - really red throughout - after a 20-minute walk in a hot box. There were some greasy, limp green beans, and sweet potato fries coated in sugar. Yuck! The first set of fries didn't have any sugar. It feels like their cooks have no idea what's on their menu, nor do they cook anything consistently. Microwaved the steak - gross, I know, but when you're hungry, you do crazy things. Threw out almost all of the veggies/fries and about half the steak (chewy/gristle). Not sure that was better than cereal from the hotel. Sigh..."}
{"text":"Do not recommend. Staff not friendly. Hostess gave us the impression she was doing us a favor.  When I asked for a chair that didn't have food spattered on it the waiter huffed at me. Asked twice for a kids menu. Ended up getting our own. Could use improvement on the service"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and stay around North Shore when I visit. Jerome Bettis is my favorite place to go for lunch and dinner. Your dining options around the stadium are sports bar or sports bar, so a sports bar has to be somewhat competitive. I mean, there are only so many things you can do to a burger and beer to keep folks coming back.

The atmosphere is a little more upscale and clean than most sports bars. It's definitely classier. 

The menu is your basic fare - burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc. I had the nachos once expecting a typical appetizer. They should have called it \"Nacho Mountain\" it was so huge, and would have fed all 4 of us sitting at our table with no issues. Good beer selection and a full bar, although I usually just do beer when I'm there.

I've had both lunch and dinner there and the service has always been good. Nothing exceptional, but they get the job done and make me feel welcome to be there.

If you're by the ballpark and want to grab a burger but still want to impress your date, this is the place I would go to."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! It's my favourite townie bar and a great place to watch any Pittsburgh game!"}
{"text":"Home of the best burger I've ever had l. The burger 36 is delicious and I recommend it to anyone in the Pittsburgh area. I love the steelers decor and memorabilia true to satisfy a fan."}
{"text":"Service was the worst. After 2 hours of waiting, we had to leave.  Sorry Jerome, love you, not the service at your restaurant. Traveled all the way from So. Calif to experience this.  So disappointed.  We had an appetizer that was delist, hence the 1 star rating."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Sunday in September to watch some football. First the service is fantastic. Our waiter worked especially hard to fill up my drinks without even asking. The men's restroom are really cool it's a one sided mirror where you can look over the whole bar. The atmosphere especially while watching the games was electric. Would really recommend this place for a lunch break or even a night out"}
{"text":"First time to the restaurant. Went the day before a Pittsburgh Steelers game and after a Saturday Pitt University game at HEINZ Field. Very busy but we were seated fast. It took a while to get a waiter and a couple of drinks, but the nachos we ordered came out fast and the main courses even faster. It was a bit cold out but the food was good [not excellent] and the view over three Rivers was nice. A bit pricy for 3 people with only 1 drink each was just under $100 with tip, but that should be expected for a niche restaurant."}
{"text":"We ate here twice and had different experiences; 1 good, the other bad. The pasta was great for our 8 year old and the flatbreads were very nice. I cannot remember the dish but it was deep fried with cheese and shrimp on the inside. This was not so good. I was hoping for something different and above par given the hype of the place, but it turned out to be just another average sports bar."}
{"text":"I really hate to even give this place one star. Awful service. Truly awful. And we had serious money to spend. Oh well!  There are other options in the area thank goodness."}
{"text":"Their bloody mary is a joke. You could make a dozen bloody marys with the cheap vodka and mix they make their drinks with for the price they charge."}
{"text":"So this place HAD been in the running for a wedding rehearsal dinner... not anymore. 

When the fiance and I arrived, we were seated right away by a girl who was dancing and speaking with coworkers as she walked us to our table. Ok, no biggie. She's just quirky. Our server could have been a football player himself and was nice enough. Fiance ordered a steak and I ordered the brioche-crusted salmon. Since we were looking for rehearsal dinner places, we figured we should get grown-up food and not burgers or sandwiches, and quite honestly that may have been our mistake.

The steak was alright... it's hard to make a steak bad in my book. It definitely was not cooked medium well as he had asked for. I'm a medium rare steak person and it was right on the cusp of being too undone for even me. It had an odd taste to it that wasn't bad, but wasn't necessarily good either.

As for the salmon... well... I probably won't come here again based off of it. The description said that it was brioche-crusted and I believe it also said there was some sort of pesto on it also. The waiter explained when I was ordering that the ratatouille that came with it had a red sauce. I didn't realize that the salmon would also have it. I ALSO didn't realize that the \"red sauce\" was tomato sauce. On salmon. Without any sort of pasta or starch. I had asked for mashed potatoes based on the fact that I didn't want red sauce veggies, and in my mind this would a been the cue for our server to inform me that the salmon also had it. Mind you there was nothing listed on the menu about it having tomato sauce. The fish itself was overcooked also which made it impossible to eat without the sauce giving it some sort of moisture.


Now I would only read this if you are wedding planning, as it is more of a rant, and won't necessarily be helpful for everyone:
My fiance recommended this place to me as being somewhere that was \"Pittsburgh\" for our rehearsal since my family and friends are from out of town. We loved the idea of being right on the river and the patio outside, and it's really the best option to chose from being the other ones are Tilted Kilt (nope) and McFaddens (love it, but it is LOUD!) So I decided to use the website and requested info regarding events as they had that option listed. Nothing. Emailed again, still nothing. Since this was a place that fiance really seemed to have his mind set on, I called. The girl that I spoke with was very helpful while on the phone. She stated that she would email me that day with event menu samples and she would research the date to see if there were any Pirates games or concerts she could find yet. This was 3 weeks ago and I still have not heard back from her. I've given up. Even though the location would be perfect, I would be terrified until the day-of that they would forget our group of 26 was coming in."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!  From walking in and standing at the bar where two bartenders looked at, then ignored, me to finally getting a table, which wasn't cleaned from the previous occupants not even when then the waitress showed up.  Either they were NOT trained properly or rudeness is acceptable.  Other than socializing I'm not sure wth they were doing."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Sports Bar in Pittsburgh.  The amount of TVs here is just RIDICULOUS.  I mean, any game you want is on, with labels on all the TVs telling you what will be on.  It's very well planned out!  Food has been pretty great for me, as a seasoned lover of American bar food.  Any place that serves a deep fried cheeseburger or italian hoagie is allright by me.  The portions are large and everything has been well-prepared every time I go.  The bar has a great selection of craft brews and liquor, but don't go by the drink descriptions written on their drink menu...I've caught them cutting costs subbing out cheaper liquors for what is labeled on the menu as premium (triple sec for Grand Marnier, for example).  Otherwise, it's a great place to sit outside and have some great bar food and a beer.  

Oh and guys...make sure you check out the bathroom...the urinals have a 2-way mirror that lets you watch the bar while you pee...very unique!"}
{"text":"Very close to football and baseball stadiums. 

Lots of TVs. I loved how they had magnets underneath each TV showing which games that TV would show.

30 beers on tap.

Very friendly and attentive waitress.

Mac and cheese was awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent wait staff and large variety menu. Trying to cut out carbs and the selection of food is fantastic. Bryan our bartender was great, very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Slow. Slow. Slow service.  Several empty tables but the kitchen takes forever.40 mins to get wings for an appetizer. Sports vibe. OK beer selection, decent pub like fare. If you are in a hurry, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"restaurant tr√®s design, entre le stade des fameux steelers de Pittsburgh et celui des Pinguins, avec terrasse avec vue imprenable sur cette super ville , plats divers, vari√©s frais , portions tr√®s g√©n√©reuses, doggy bag possible, vu les portions!!!!"}
{"text":"On 12/21 I went for lunch with a few friends.  The food was great - spot on.  SW Club, Bus Steak Salad, Barnyard Burger and Chicken Caesar Salad.  All worthy picks.  I'm writing this to commend the great service.  Our server was Darkel and we did also meet the Manager - Eugene.  Darkel was professional, polite and friendly.  I would call Eugene a 'restaurant ambassador'.  This man is a good as it gets and we all appreciated his attention.  You have options in the area but this is the place to visit!  Enjoy, dine well."}
{"text":"The ultimate Bar and Grille for Pittsburgh sports fan.The food is diverse and good.The service is very friendly and the prices based on location are reasonable.Being this close to sports stadiums it's easy to gouge patrons.See LA Live next to the Staples Center in Los Angeles.For my money the deep fried hoagie is just as enjoyable as a Primanti Bros. sandwich!Thanks 36!"}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh exploring the city over the Easter long weekend - 2 adults, 3 kids aged 11,8,7. My husband had heard of this place before, and tour guide on Gateway Clipper reco'd it. We ended up driving around the downtown area but a lot was closed, so we circled back around to Grill 36. It was almost empty, so the service was friendly and fast. Good upscale pub menu, lots of TV's playing sports, good beer selection. We had nachos as an app- amazing. The queso was def house made, as was the chili. For mains, kids devoured mac and cheese, pulled pork sliders, and chicken tenders (the real meat kind!). Fries were hot and crispy. Hubs has farmyard burger - topped with OE egg; said it was amazing. I had pan fried chicken, which was lightly breaded, and served with bacon cream gravy, garlic mashed red skins, and asparagus. It was FANTASTIC. Table next to us had wings that smelled amazing. Server told us 95% of their items are made in house, and you could tell. Thoroughly enjoyed Grill 36."}
{"text":"You don't have to be a football fan to grab a bite here but it helps.  There were tons of items on the lunch menu but I ended up picking one that was just a little better quality than average.  My lunch buddy thought much more highly of hers so I'm willing to revisit the rating after returning for different entrees.  The service was very good although a little slow for a city lunch rush; I'll have to make sure the meeting calendar is clear for an extended lunch hour the next time."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere here.  It's classy but casual.  Really it's just a good place to grab a decent meal before or during a Steelers or Pirates game if you aren't tailgating or don't want to spend $50 on a few hot dogs.

The food isn't great but it could be much, much worse.  I'd much rather have dessert here than a real meal though.  They actually do pretty well in that area."}
{"text":"Early lunch on a Sunday. Ordered the slider appetizers and a small side salad. The salad was excellent. Nice variety of mixed greens and a tangy honey mustard. The sliders were disappointing. Advertised with a \"special sauce\", there was nothing but the meat and cheese on a stale bun. I asked for mashed potatoes instead of fries and they were VERY dry. Real potatoes which is good, but lacking adequate moisture to please in texture. OK venue."}
{"text":"Went here for a Pirates Mets game. Mac and cheese is to die for! Decent food."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good bar to hang out at before a concert at Stage AE.  We wanted to sit down for several drinks before heading out.  One bartender took our beer order.  After a few minutes waiting, another bartender asked if we had been helped and we said yes, asked us what our order was and poured it for us.  The other bartender began arguing with us and the other bartender as to who was serving us.  They were clearly irritated with us and each other.  We quickly got our drinks and headed outside where a manager immediately stopped us and said we could not sit out here unless we were being seated to eat.  Although I could understand such a policy if they were very busy, but there was tons of open seating and she was extremely rude.  All of this happened in about 5 minutes.  We sucked down our beers and jetted.  We love Pittsburgh but this will never be on our list again.  The other bars around here were much more fun, accommodating, and fantastic!"}
{"text":"tourist trap
noun
a place, as a restaurant, shop, or hotel, that exploits tourists by overcharging.

Keep your $9.00 shots and lackluster service to yourself.  Sorry to say, but if the staff here was Bettis' blockers, he'd have negative yards.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"We went there for our sons birthday dinner. It was our first time there. The manager made us feel like we was the only people in the restaurant even though they was extremely busy. Food was great and our waiter was on top of everything. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Two things that stood out about this restaurant - it is overpriced and it has a great view on the patio of the water and is super close to the stadium.
The medium size wings were a pound of wings for $17, and I ordered the Buffalo garlic sauce, I did not taste any garlic, just Buffalo. The wings were OK overall. 
The deep-fried pretzel sticks were good with the queso. 
The chips & queso was also good and the salsa was quite hot. Though I do not see how the chips & queso were worth eight dollars.
I think I would really only come here to enjoy the view."}
{"text":"I'm not sure when the people with negative reviews visited or who was their server/cook but I had the completely opposite experience. My friends and I got to the restaurant a little late, about a half hour before kitchen closed yet they were more than willing to take us in and serve us. Our server who's name I really wish I remembered was easily the best server I have ever experienced. He was awesome with his knowledge of the menu, beers, and the area around the bar(I'll explain later.)

  We got there and were seated immediately and had our drink orders taken right away after a couple of suggestions from our server on beers. Speaking of beers, I love that the menu denotes which beers are brewed in-state. It was the last day of a weekend trip to the city so we went all out for our dinner. I got the 36 steak which was cooked to perfection. Since it was so late, the kitchen asked if they could butterfly it so it could cook faster which I totally understood and appreciated them just giving me the heads up. All my friends meals were cooked to perfection and they were thrilled with the meals.

 As we talked with our server we discussed how we had been looking for a good cigar bar in the area and were told by a server in another local restaurant that there was none. Our server was baffled knowing there was one right in between Grille 36 and the other business. He went so far as to get the number of the bar and call himself to see if it was still open for us.  

Overall, we were kind of skeptical with mixed reviews, but after our meal Monday night, Grille 36 will forever be remembered as one of the better restaurants I've been to with some of the best staff I have experienced.

P.S. Men should definitely check out the one way mirror in the bathroom, definitely an awesome feature."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times and usually it's a great experience. 

The last time I went, the server was awesome, but they must have had their B team in the kitchen. My salad was tasty and everyone else enjoyed their entrees - but when I thought back about it, my salad was missing two of the ingredients that were listed on the menu. But hey, I was tipsy and didn't miss them while I was eating. They were out of carrot cake (basically the reason we came). We got the brownie instead and it was pretty dry. I could have made better out of a box. 

But, overall it's a fun place with good food and big portions!"}
{"text":"Very good food,  soup and flat bread were excellent,  enough portion for 2 meals.  Very clean and the service was good and fast with enough time to let me go back to my conference on time.  Also had a burger here once and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Yum...food amazing..Rich is nicest server ever!  Very kind ! Being an Ohio girl...have to say Pittsburgh is beautiful!  Very nice place!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate dinner here on 12/27/16 and the service was slow and took forever.  When our dinners arrived, my daughter's mashed potatoes were cold.  The blackened mahi mahi sandwich I ordered was missing the cheese I requested and when the waiter took it back, the chef slapped a piece of cheese on the fish and it didn't even melt.  When we spoke to the waiter about it, nothing was done.   We were very displeased with the food and service during this outing.  Not sure if we will return again."}
{"text":"Beautiful day to sit outside and take in the city while enjoying the Deep fried burger which is a must try!  Boneless wings were on point, Good flavor. Barnyard burger was really juicy and delicious. It was a home run!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a Steelers fan but I really do like this place! I like the atmosphere because it does show Pittsburgh pride with showing support for all of our sports. The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and relaxed, the lights are dimmed. The food is really good and the service is good as well! They have some different food to serve. I recommend the perogie flatbread, it's an appetizer but I had it as my deal and the portion was a good size and it was really good! If I'm down in the North Side, Jerome Bettis Grille is the place I'm most likely to go to."}
{"text":"Monday night I stopped by with my dog as this restaurant came up as a dog friendly place. 
I was seated outside quickly and got service quickly afterwards. The staff was very friendly and brought a dog bowl. I ordered a fat head IPA beer and it was great! I ordered the highest ABV IPA, as I don't usually drink beer much. I ordered the fried chicken entree as there were some food options that the restaurant was out of at the time. Although, my food came out wrong, the staff took care of everything and made things right. I sincerely enjoyed my food and my beer. I will most likely return again in the future."}
{"text":"Good food and great decor, but not quite worth the price. The wait staff where fairly decent. It is more of a sports bar then a Grille."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Great food and lots of choices in alcohol! Service was fast and friendly! Recommend for any game days or anytime!"}
{"text":"Went with 5 other friends on Saturday after the penguin game.  First thing i noticed was the wait time and the many empty tables,  a true sign of poor management.  After waiting 25 minutes, we were seated.  The waitress took our drink order than came back two other times to get our food order without the drinks. I ordered the chips and salsa and it came with a large bowl of salsa with only a handful of chips.   The salsa was excellent but i ran out of chips within a few minutes and since our waitress disappeared they didnt get refilled until my meal was served.  I ordered the deep fried italian hoagie.   Like many things on the menu it sounded better than it tasted and it didnt help that we all sat there for too long with empty beer glasses.   Like this review, Bettis's was just your average sports bar with average food, but the atmosphere was cool and the outdoor seating is a plus so I am sure we will be back.  The stars are for the food only."}
{"text":"After visiting Jerome Bettis Grille on a few Sunday afternoons, I find it to be a mediocre sports bar.  

The hubby orders the BLT Double Grilled Cheese Ranch Burger every time we visit.  It is always cooked as ordered and has scrumptious amounts of bacon and cheese surrounding a juicy burger.  I seem to always steer toward the Ultimate Mac 'N Cheese which is actually done really well for restaurant standards.

The service could be a little better as the wait staff always seems to be being pulled in 100 difference directions.  Also, there are always so many hosts/hostesses just standing around. 

We have never had to wait for a table but know how uncomfortable it would be if we had to as the entry way and hostess stand are practically on top of each other making you dodge people upon entrance and exit.  There has got to be some way to rectify this.

They have televisions at the booth's but we have yet to get a working one.  It either doesn't even turn on or, if it does, you cannot change the channel it is on."}
{"text":"went on a monday afternoon, it was quiet but that's okay. had the street tacos app, perfect amount for dinner and delicious! our waitress dayna was the best, so nice and super helpful. She helped us find out where we should go for the rest of our day in pittsburgh. always a good place to go."}
{"text":"We stopped by last Sunday at 2pm. Non-gameday and not busy. The floor of the bar was dirty with stepped on food and trash. & the bar reeked - the odors given off my unclean bar mats and beer lines that haven't been cleaned out in ages. We had a round & left."}
{"text":"The Burger 36 sounded so good on the menu .. but was a little on the dry and wasn't as flavorful as expected.  Listed on the menu \"short rib & chuck infused with bacon\" oh that sold me right away, however; it tasted like a burger that I cooked in my toaster oven  with A1 steak sauce.$14.00 - came with fries - that's an expensive lunch. I will give the restaurant another chance and order something different next time I visit.  Maybe \"burgers\" aren't their specialty."}
{"text":"Reading other reviews, I thought they had an allergy friendly menu but it turns out that it's just a gluten free menu. They don't care about other food allergies like soy. They use soybean oil to fry everything so that cut out half the menu. I'm giving two stars because the waitress was helpful at running back to the kitchen staff to ask if I could eat certain things. The only things I could eat were a salad with oil & vinegar or a side vegetable. If you want a meal and you have an allergy, don't come here. #notallergyfriendly"}
{"text":"It was my first visit. I enjoyed it. Very good service from drinks to dinner. Didn't have to wait long, they weren't exactly busy though. The food I did order was very good the \"TOT\"- chips were nice and crispy and the toppings were amazing. Also I ordered a Sesame chicken salad, very delicious. They only thing I wasn't okay with was the price. I think you're paying for \"Jerome Bettis\" rather than the quality of the meal. I would return."}
{"text":"Service was great. I ordered an appetizer that was the size of an entree. The drinks we good also. The atmosphere I also enjoyed. Sports played all around. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I typically wouldn't give a sports bar 5 stars, but I couldn't think of anything wrong with the place! I went at lunch and sat at the bar, and even with only one bartender, service was efficient and helpful. I didn't get a drink since I had to return to work, but I ordered the pierogi flatbread and a side of the legendary mac and cheese. It was ENTIRELY too much food, but man was it worth it! The flatbread was everything I wanted it to be - a great balance of the potato, cheese, and onion, nothing overly heavy. And the mac and cheese... a friend had mandated I get it, and I originally was going to order the entree, but she stopped me in my tracks and said the side was enough. It WAS. The richest, most decadent mac and cheese I think I've ever had! So needless to say, I left about $16 lighter and 100 lbs heavier."}
{"text":"Staff not very accommodating. At 11:00 am, refused to change channels for us to watch rain delayed Nascar. Instead, they had Wimbledon on half the TVs and baseball highlights from last night on the other half. WTH? I guess they didn't need our business."}
{"text":"It has an outstanding location between Heinz field and PNC Park. 

I thought this might be a tourist trap type of place.  But loved Jerome Bettis as a player and decided to go just the same.

The food was very good and the prices were not bad considering its location.  Let me just say this; don't eat here if you are not very hungry.  As one Steeler wrote on the wall, \"You can tell this is a big guy's place!\"  That sums it up the portions are very large and most of the food is not very good for you.  I even saw a deep fried hamburger on the menu (not kidding).

We got the nachos for an appetizer and could have stopped right there.  It was the biggest nacho appetizer I have ever seen in a restaurant. My wife and I both got different salads which were wonderful but we could not finish because of the nachos.  The kids got cheeseburgers which they could not even eat half of.

The seats are comfortable and there are flat screen televisions everywhere you look.  We saw that several of the booth tables had their own TVs too.

The only negative was that there is no parking expect for the lot across the street and price to park there varies depending on the day and what is going on around that location.  Parking can vary from $5 to $25."}
{"text":"Very good Mac and cheese, and the bulgogi taco was a great appetizer. A little pricey, but very good!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the ribeye medium rare.  Came a bit over cooked and it was dry compared to what it should be for a ribeye.  Certainly not richly marbled as advertised on the menu"}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant in the city I can eat in and not worry about gluten contamination! They have wings, French fries, tots all fried up in a dedicated fryer. As usual, make sure to let your server or bartender aware of your gluten intolerance and watch for your food to be served on a circle plate. They even carry Omission beer. The food is good as well as the service."}
{"text":"I came here the Steeler game on Monday night with two of my friends. The space is nice and roomy with a lot of seating. My friends and i found a table at the bar area and sat there. I will start by saying two things: 1) our waiter came right over and asked for our drink orders (i like that) and 2) the bar area was a little busy, not definitely not completely full. He brought us back our drinks and then went on to another table. He wanted to put an app in, but our waiter never came back. Finally when he did, he brought another guy over and said that since they were so busy (they weren't) that they would both be helping us out tonight. A while later, the original waiter comes back over and says \"he's taking care of you now, right? Okay good.\" Then ran away as fast as he came. At this time we were still waiting to put our appetizer order in. Finally about a half hour later, the second guy comes over and asks if we needed anything. (My water was empty). At that time, we put in our appetizer order, some more drink orders, and i asked for more water, because we didn't know when he'd be back. He came back about 10 minutes later with our appetizer and then about 10 minutes after that when our drink orders. A while later he came back to take our dinner orders. Two of us got salads and the third person for a turkey burger. It took almost 45 minutes for our food to arrive and was brought out by someone else. A half hour after our food came out, our waiter came back and was very anxious to give us our check. He did not check to see how our food was nor did he refill our drinks. Once he dropped off the checks, he was very quick to take our checks and bring them back. We stayed until the end of the game and he didn't come back to check on us once we cashed out. He didn't offer any more water or anything. 

On top of that, the food was nothing exciting. I gave this place 2 stars because the atmosphere and warm and inviting and it is a great place to watch a game. But, i probably won't be back."}
{"text":"So we are in Pittsburgh for the Easter weekend. Staying down the street from Heinz stadium.  After our stadium tour, we decided to eat here.  Nice day out so we asked to sit outside.  It wasn't terribly busy. No line or ppl waiting, however the hostess was completely overwhelmed.  Ok so we get sat outside.  The table was wobbly and took about ten minutes for a server to come over.  Such chaos!  Food runners were bringing food to wrong tables...it was terrible.  We finally got our appetizer firecracker shrimp (after it was almost pawned off to three other tables)-it was amazing.   We ran out of drinks halfway through the appetizer---and then our food finally came after they thought they already served it to us.  It was cold!  Our waitress finally brought my husband a beer, it was the wrong one.  I got up two times to refill my water myself.  Really really poor experience!"}
{"text":"Do not get the Grown up Grilled cheese,it barely had enough cheese to hold the two pc of bread together, way over priced at $14.00.
My husband did like his chicken sandwich. The service was friendly."}
{"text":"Julia was awesome! And manager Eric helped us Elton our ticket situations , great place good people , great food and fun time!!"}
{"text":"Before the Pitt vs VT game . We had a group of 14 and the pulled it off , with a mixed of people in and out at different times . I had the black n blue burger . Great , done as I like . Fries were very good . Service was as good as you could hope on game day ."}
{"text":"You're probably thinking how have you lived in Pittsburgh forever and never been here?  I don't know but I know I'll be back. 

We went on a Sunday night when it was dead after the March Madness events in Pittsburgh blew over.  If you're gonna watch sports in Pittsburgh this would be a good option to do it.  TVs are at every angle and I mean EVERY ANGLE, even in the booths.  That was another highlight, huge divided privacy booths big enough for 4 with 6 people's worth of room. Fast, friendly service from our waiter Niko kept the mood perfect.  A large beer/wine selection upped the odds of leaving tipsy.  We ordered the loaded nachos for the appetizer and we loved them.  Enough for 4 people.  For entrees we got the sliders and salmon.  I don't think the food was mind blowing but it was fresh, hot and full of flavor, adequate.  Afterwards we sat and the bar and had a few more drinks because at this point we were highly satisfied with the pace and efficiency of the night.

I'll have to go back on a busy night and see if the execution is the same, but from our first go through I'll say I look forward to going back.  Maybe even get the 36 ounce steak!"}
{"text":"Family of four dinner. Pretzel appetizer was best part of the meal. Perogies were mediocre. Pulled pork was served cold and flavor was poor. Fish dinners were very average. Love the 'Bus' but the restaurant will never make the hall of fame."}
{"text":"Being a sports fan, I was looking forward to having a drink and an appetizer at Jerome Bettis's restaurant right next to Heinz Field.  First of all, I was disappointed by the interior.  I expected lots of football memorabilia (helmets, jerseys, photos, etc.)  However, the only thing really plastered on the walls were letters of congratulations to Mr. Bettis from NFL and local celebrities.  The atmosphere was typical of any sport's bar & grill and I had expected a little more from this place based on the name and location.  

We asked the hostess if we could sit near a TV that was showing our favorite baseball team.  When she couldn't find a table near a big screen, she gave us a large booth with our own private, smaller screen where we could change the channel to whatever we liked.  So that was a nice accommodation.

We ended up splitting the nachos which were absolutely huge.  However, we are vegetarians, so we asked if we could substitute the chili for guacamole.  The server asked and the manager said \"no\".  So we paid the extra dollar for the guacamole anyway and it ended up being served in something similar to the little, plastic, ketchup containers you might get at Burger King.  In other words, we would have needed about 12 of these to match the mound of chips we were given.  Overall, the flavor of the nachos was good, but we were underwhelmed by the restaurant's inflexibility and the tiny portion of our appetizer's upgrade."}
{"text":"This place has a great gluten free menu.  Their steak/ egg/ whatever salad is amazing and their bacon burger AND FRIES!!!!!!!! is likewise delectable.  I'm always a bit impressed when a place can offer me SAFE fries.  They do have a designated gluten free menu... so you just have to ask.  I'm pretty sure everything even comes out on specially shaped plates to fully differentiate gluten from gluten free items.   Overall its a nice place to catch a game, chat with a few buddies, and eat +/- drink.  Parking might be a challenge if its a game night... but there are something like 3 lots within 2-3 blocks that you can pay a rather low rate for the night."}
{"text":"Had to check it out before the Pirates game.  It actually isn't really all that football-y though, other than the huge picture on the one wall.  It feels like any Pittsburgh sports figure could have opened this up and done the same thing, like Louis Lipps or Andy Van Slyke. It's just a kind of fancy looking sports bar that gets away with being overpriced due to the location.  

The one thing that stands out is the men's room, probably one of the coolest public bathrooms I've ever been to.  The two way mirror is a fantastic touch.  Good job by The Bus on that one."}
{"text":"My friends and I celebrated a birthday at Jerome Bettis' Grille and we had a wonderful time! There was 16 of us and they were so nice about accommodating us and it didn't take long for us to get a table. Our waiter, Brian, was wonderful and brought us anything we needed!

We all started off with drinks - margaritas, mojitos, mixed drinks and drafts! The appetizers were great, especially the nachos! For our meals, a few people had the southwest club, that they said was delicious! I had the Black and Bleu burger and it was great! I would definitely go back and like to try the deep fried hoagie. That looked really good!"}
{"text":"No doubt Jerome Bettis was an outstanding football player, but I was unsure of his culinary qualities. I decided to give his Grille 36 a try and was pleasantly surprised. The menu is so diverse and features a lot of choices. The pierogies were delicious, as was the Moroccan pomegranate BBQ chicken. On a second visit, I had the Cabo Burger, with shrimp, Monterey jack cheese, and an orange/lime spread. Interesting and tasty, although a bit greasy; I felt a little sick afterwards. I thought well of the service; our waitress was friendly, and the service was quick. Playing a Miley Cyrus song, however, is a black mark. Really Jerome? You're better than playing Miley Cyrus in your restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, service was ok. The burgers are different but very good. Great selection of local draft beer"}
{"text":"Walked in after a long flight looking forward to some lunch.  Entering the front door, there was no one at the front desk.  2 wait staff members walked by and said nothing.  When the phone rang, two girls scampered across the room to answer it as if there was a prize for the first person to answer.  The other girl looked and me and said hello.  I asked if I could sit in the bar area and she said \"Sure, it's self-seating.\"  I picked an empty space along the outside wall and patiently waited while the server was at the table next to me.  I opened my phone to write an email and read a few while I waited....and waited...and waited... After waiting 15 min and receiving no service, I decided to leave.  As I passed the hostess that spoke to me before, she said have a nice day, not even recognizing that I was the same person that had spoken to her just 15 minutes before.  If you want good or fast service, avoid Jerome Bettis Grille 36.  If you have time on your hands, go for it."}
{"text":"On a Friday evening with a baseball game, playoff hockey game, and Alice Cooper concert, this place was popping, but quick and efficient! We waited less than 30 minutes for a table, our waitress was awesome, and the food was spectacular! Don't let a busy night scare you away from this place. Keep in mind that it may be a longer wait to eat outside on a beautiful night. I definitely recommend the new Firecracker shrimp...it's amazingly delicious, to say the least. This place was worth every minute and penny!"}
{"text":"I like this place, but have to admit I've only been here on weeknights when there is nothing going on at any of the neighborhood venues. So I can't comment on how things are when it's packed. The menu runs the gamut from typical (and reasonably priced) sports bar fare (wings, burgers, etc.) on up to more expensive steaks and \"specialties\". I've found the food to be inconsistent, very satisfying on one visit and then disappointing on the next. But I come to watch my favorite NY sports channels (yep, they get MSG, SNY and YES) while eating at the bar, so I can live with the average food. There is a nice selection of beer and wine, but prices are a bit steep ...$6-7 for a pint of craft beer, $8-10 for a glass of average wine.

Service has been friendly and efficient on my visits, but again, the place has not been particularly crowded when I've been here.

I will also add that the space is very nice. Not only is the restaurant right on the river with a pleasant outdoor patio area for dining, the interior is really very upscale for a sports bar."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents after a Pirates game. They are big Steelers fans and they'd been wanting to check it out. The menu was lacking, the service was just okay, and the outdoor seating was not ideal. The inside was packed so we were seated at a small outdoor area with really low sofa-like chairs and basically a coffee table. It was really hard to eat our food and I was disappointed that my parents didn't get to have a better experience. I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Nothing else on the menu really appealed to me. The sandwich was good though. We may have had a better experience if we waited for an inside table or came at a less busy time, but I still don't think we'd go there again. The menu is a little dull for such a wait. I regret not being able to sit inside to check out the decor, but it was understandably packed after the game. My dad was amused by the bathroom with the two-way mirror. At least we can say we went there once."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Steelers fan as we left West Virginia I wanted to go to Pittsburgh before we drove back to Utah.¬† I found this on yelp near the field and not directly in the city so we could exit easier.¬† We sat at the bar and the bartender was so sweet.¬† I asked for a Mai Tai since I can't get them in Utah.¬† She was unsure how to make it so she google it and nailed it on her first shot, it reminded me of the first one I got hooked on in Las vegas.¬† 

The artichoke spinach dip was so good.¬† The consistency wasn't what was expected but, that wasn't a bad thing.¬† The spinach looked like it was wilted in the dip before being brought out.¬† The pork bellies were quite a wonderful addition to the dip.¬† I enjoyed the large chunks of artichoke.¬† It was very creamy and flavored well,¬† the salty crackers made it a great salty flavor that wasn't overpowering.

My hubby had the burger 36 and loved it.¬† He ate the whole plate and was making mmmm sounds.¬† I didn't try it so I only have his response to review but, he was quite pleased with his choice.

I had the new York strip medium rare and I didn't think I could finish it but, I dang near did.¬† It was so tender I hardly needed my knife.¬† I also judge my steaks on the seasoning without steak sauce (if I use steak sauce it's not a good thing, I don't like steak sauce, it shouldn't be needed on good steak).¬† The steak was seasoned well, only a little salty which I like, not overpowering but, mostly a pepper flavor which is what I love.¬† I couldn't pinpoint the other seasonings but, I don't care it was a wonderful steak.¬† The mashed potatoes were very good, a little crispy on one side like it was exposed to something hot, not sure.¬† The broccoli was cooked well but, had a bit to mush salt for my liking.¬† 

I would go here again just for that steak, spinach dip, and if that lovely bartender is there the Mai tai, it was worth it!"}
{"text":"It was crowded but we didn't have to wait too long. Food was awesome. Service was awesome. Prices are great. We are from out of town and will be back. Oh and the pierogi flatbread and nachos are fabulous!"}
{"text":"We were in town and wanting to watch his Jets and my Steelers, so we thought Bettis' would give us a good mix of \"being with the crowd\" actually attending a game, and \"being able to watch on TV.\" We were correct in that regard, though the TVs were a little on the small side. I'm spoiled though, so I didn't actually complain about that or anything. Just something I noted. Being as it was game day we got there early, and despite being told there was a 2 hour wait, were seated within 10 minutes (our first drink at the bar hadn't even been poured yet.) I'm sure it's hard to guess whether a group is staying for the whole game or just trying to eat before heading to the game, so that was sort of understandable.

I started with a mimosa, and then found out they were $8....and since they were served in a plastic 5oz water cup....not exactly worth it. We opted for the Miller Light $4 special instead. We shared a pile of wings, and the spinach/artichoke dip. The dip was one of the better ones I've had, and even though I'm not typically a pork belly person, it definitely added a little something something. The wings were good too, definitely meaty! We tried black and gold BBQ and Hot Buffalo. Whoo! That was hot. For serious.

Overall, it's good people watching and sports watching, especially on game day, but there are a few things that could be improved upon (like the mimosa situation.) They had fun raffles and whatnot throughout the game too which was fun."}
{"text":"Back again, whoops.  We are staying at a nearby hotel, figured we would come here for drinks and dessert.  Waited 40 mins, which I really didn't care about then when we were the last party waiting, host staff asked what we were doing.  I said waiting, of course.  They said we were notified of outlet table earlier so I showed them my phone.  Apparently we could have seated much sooner but we weren't sent any notification.  Whatever.  Ordered a cocktail with Maker's.  It was not awesome, served in a plastic cup, probably a total of 4oz of liquid - $14.  Wife's drink was similar, $10 and not worth it either.

Last visit to the Bettis Grille."}
{"text":"The place was pretty busy as a Pirates game had just ended. 

Our food arrived quickly and was pretty good. We had TOTchos (tater tot nachos). I had the Bettis burger, slightly small for the price, and fries.The bun was twice the size of the burger and the fries were meh. My husband got the fish and chips but substituted the chips for mac n cheese. The fish was great. The mac n cheese was basically a full meal on its own but was incredibly heavy.

I'd return if we were in the area but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Great stop after a tour of Heinz Field ....... we stopped in the afternoon for lunch on a Saturday, not much wait at all ....... Many menu choices , kids meals available! 

Food was good , wait staff very attentive"}
{"text":"I stopped in for an early dinner and this place was packed. I always assume that's a great sign or at least that the food will be worth the wait...But for me the food here was just okay. 

I ordered a turkey burger with a side of tater tots. Then I waited...and waited. When my burger finally arrived I was too hungry to snap a pic but it was a bit disappointing. While I was glad it wasn't just an average turkey burger patty it was a bit dry and could have used a tad bit more seasoning. The tater tots were good but a little on the salty side. 

I was waiting to be blown away and it just didn't happen. But I'm not giving up on this place. I'd give them another try maybe when they aren't so busy (there were three events going on the night I went) and see if they can make me a fan."}
{"text":"If you're here in the city visiting, this is a really nice establishment to have lunch or dinner.  The food is really good and the staff is extremely nice.  However,  the wait time and the time to receive your food is too lengthy."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Dirty plates. Wrong orders. Waiter came off like he didn't care. Tv's were broken and there was spilled food on the floor that they just stepped over instead of cleaning."}
{"text":"Staff was amazing, mac and cheese and burgers were really good. Obviously the atmosphere is amazing. Over priced, but really good"}
{"text":"The food was eh to average, but the atmosphere after a Steelers win over them nasty bengals was fantastic. Nice beers though.  Plenty of other good food restaurants we could've eaten at.  But we can say we ate at The Bus' place!!"}
{"text":"6-12 minute wait was actually over 35 minutes.


Good food....just not an accurate wait time by any means !"}
{"text":"We chose this place for my mom's birthday because it sits on the river and offered something fun for everyone. The menu also looked appealing.

My parents got their first, ordered drinks and an appetizer, all of which came out fairly quickly. The meal quickly went down from there. We ordered one other, very simple appetizer (pretzels), and fairly simple meals (burgers, salads, and one baked chicken dinner) and waited nearly an hour for these items. We had given ourselves 95 minutes for parking (paid that much) and ended up having to add money to the meter because the service at Bettis Grille was so slow and incompetent. 

I was a server for years and so am usually patient with restaurant servers. I know what it's like when things get busy and you're doing the best you can. Bettis' Grille was NOT busy the day we were there, nor was our server running around. In fact, he spent a lot of time standing up by the computer (where they enter orders) dong...I don't know what! Overall, this was a very underwhelming experience, and the food was only okay. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We love the aspect of all things Steelers and try to support the legend  of \"the Bus\". Every year we try and seems it is a fail. Service was poor in that you could not even get someone to look at you when walked in. It was a late Sunday, well after the crowds were gone. The server was to distracted to bother with our meager order of dessert and drinks. 
We love you Jerome, but will break tradition and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday night with a couple friends from out of town before hitting the bars.  Perhaps not our first choice for an authentic Pittsburgh dinner but I had a gift card so we decided to give it a try. I also didn't mind rubbing Pittsburgh sports into my Philly friends' faces. 

We went during a Pens game and the place was pretty packed. We put our names in and got a drink at the CROWDED bar. The bar was definitely the sports crowd so I felt a little out of place in a \"going out\" dress.  We got a great booth with a TV in the dining area part of the restaurant. 

Food: I would give the food at 7 out of 10. I got the seared tuna which was quite a large portion of high grade tuna. Spicy and delicious. It came with \"dirty rice\" which mean chunks of sausage in the rice.  Not really my style so I got pilaf instead. One of my friends got the Mahi Mahi which was really good as well. I would never order a cream base pasta but a had more than a couple bites of it (if you order something healthy but eat someone else's unhealthy meal the calories don't count, its science) and I loved it! Other friend got a typical Pittsburgh steak salad minus the fries and onion rings (she doesn't understand this Pittsburgh staple). She liked it though. 

We started off with the goat cheese app. It wasn't culinary genius (goat cheese, marinara, warm bread, balsamic drizzle) but it was a good app to share and everyone liked it. 

Drinks: OOOO THE DRINKS! This is where the place went from a 3 star to a 4 star. After going to Church Brew Works the day before jonesing for a cocktail and coming up empty handed because they didn't have a list, this was a great surprise. About 40 speciality cocktails. 30 Beers on tap and 30 something bottles. Got a \"healthy\" Acai drink which was nice and girly. Then followed my cocktail with a....multiple beers. Great List. Something for everyone. 


Atmosphere: Not enough TVs, haha. The place was on the louder side because it was busy.  I thought drunk college kids were sitting behind us but it was actually a group of 50-somethings (classy, dad).  Overall the restaurant is beautiful for a sports bar. Definitely a tourist crowd especially with the Patriots game the next day. 

Service: Our server was great. She let my picky friends move to another table in the corner.  She was very knowledgeable( I want to give her props but a forget her name...brunette pony tail).  My (gay) friend was a fan of all the cute bus boys. He insisted they only hire gay bus boys because they won't pay attention to the games (haha).  

Pro: Drink list, lively restaurant, quick service even though they were busy. 

Con: Bar was slammed almost like a crowded club. Some people were drunk and obnoxious ( if a had a couple more beers I wouldn't have cared). 

Generally good food. solid drinks. Just really Busy!"}
{"text":"I can't begin to say enough good things about our experience at the Bettis Grille.  Missi, Tiffany and their staff could not have been any more attentive.  We hosted our son's Bar Mitzvah party with 125 guests at Bettis' and everyone had a fantastic time.  The River Room was transformed into an awesome dance space for the kids and adults.  Everyone was able to spread out into the bar and patio area.  We did not lack for space, especially considering the gorgeous weather along the river. I worked with Missi over the past few months selecting the menu, room layout, vendor coordination, etc.  She provided everything that we asked for, including delicious food and service.  They were catering to both the kids and adults.  Some of the reviews have mentioned the TV's.  We had a looping photo slide show playing on most of them.  Every time you looked up, you couldn't help but pause and watch.  Just the effect were were hoping for!  The staff went above and beyond, assisting in set-up and clean-up beyond their regular duties.  Toia (sp?) was especially gracious and bonded with our family.  You would never know that this was there first time hosting a Bar Mitzvah party.  I hope that our party leads to future bookings. FANTASTIC VENUE!!!  Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"Great location, traffic can be a hassle even if not a game day. Had the wings in the signature black and gold sauce. They were delicious and I would get them again. The rest of the family enjoyed their meal. If your in the area definitely stop by."}
{"text":"This place has many pluses... 

The location is super nice, tv's for everyone, outside seating is on the river and overlooks the point... All very nice...

The drink selection isn't bad either... but the food...eek. 

Ok, so I'm a veg, which may be where the problem lies... but I have eaten here twice, and not been impressed either time.

Chips and Salsa are out of a jar and bag... bleh
Caesar salad was ok, but nothing great...meh
Veggie burger was ... oh how do I put this in to words that describe the horror...the veggie burger was a disgrace to humanity and to all things living and to everything that is to be born in the next century.

 I mean it wasn't just terrible, it was effing TURRIBLE... soggy, mushy, lukewarm, baby food consistency, tasteless, oh god please help me finish some of this so I don't look like an idiot on this date, shit... A true disgrace.

Bettis, seriously, F***ing seriously, 86 it. Forever."}
{"text":"Had the spinach appetizer. It was okay,. It didn't have much flavor & was more of a soup consistency than a dip. Prices are high and menu appears to be trying to be high end, which is weird when the bus' name is on the door. Actually walked to the restaurant from the Hyatt Place hotel specifically to watch the Rangers game and grab a bite to eat unfortunately after five minutes was not able to get the waitresses to identify which TV could be change to the game. As it was the bottom of the eighth inning I chose just to watch the ending via the mlb app I have on my phone."}
{"text":"This was on our list of places to try in Pittsburgh, I'm glad we did!  The service was great, atmosphere was fun, food was amazing.  Our table was very sticky, which was a big turn off, but the dining area was clean and the food and service made up for the sticky table. The four of us had a pierogi flatbread, spinach and artichoke dip, kids mac and cheese with fruit, and a barnyard burger.  The portions were huge, we could have shared a couple items.  The kids mac was delicious, everyone tried it and the kid still had more than he could eat.  First, I have to say that I was impressed that every kids meal came with one side.  Most places only certain items get a side, and typically the macaroni and cheese is not one of those items.  The fruit cup wowed me, actual fresh fruit!  Watermelon, cantaloupe, grapes, and blueberries- a 'cup of soup' size bowl.  The spinach and artichoke dip was a generous portion with both tortilla chips and pita bread slices.  The teenager barely put a dent in it but she was busy picking off of everyone else's plate!  The pierogi flatbread was so delicious, and a unique combination.  Just the right amount of food to feel very full but not overly stuffed.  The barnyard burger was a great burger and when given a choice of fries or tots, the hubby couldn't decide so he got both.  He definitely liked the tots better, but didn't get to eat many between the two kids!  This is a great place to go and we will be back!"}
{"text":"A lot of hype, but the food and service were just okay. It's been a while, so I think it is due for another chance."}
{"text":"Being a native of Dallas (Go Cowboys), I already had a negative perception of this Steeler restaurant.  But it won me over.  The wait on game/playoff/football weekend sucks...real bad.  But Pittsburgh loves its sport teams and I can respect that.

When you first walk into the restaurant you notice all the black and gold and TVs.  There are flat panel HDTVs everywhere you turn, which are tuned into many different sports so you won't miss anything.

As I was waiting for 1.5 hours I saw a waitress carry around a nice piece of steak.  It looked so delicious.  So I got it.  It was satisfying.  

I also recommend the \"house made bread pudding with sweet flakey croissants, oatmeal, and raisins\" for dessert.  It is scrumptious.  

I would recommend taking \"The BUS\" to this grill because parking in the lot across the street costs money."}
{"text":"Excellent example of a place that stays in business solely because of its location.  I ate at Jerome Bettis's on a college football Saturday, and it was crowded, but not packed.  Service was okay - friendly but slow.  The high point is definitely the location: can't think of a better restaurant patio in Pittsburgh.  The views of the rivers, point, and skyline are incredible.  They've got a lot of TVs, too - never a bad thing for a sports bar.

Food was abysmal.  I had the Carolina pulled pork sandwich, which I knew would be bad.  (I have yet to find good pulled pork outside of dingy BBQ places in the Southeast.)  However, I was unprepared for what came out: the sandwich had cheese on top.  Maybe I should've read the menu more closely, but it would never have occurred to me that someone would even think to put cheese on one; even my Pennsylvania-native compadres thought it was weird.  (By the way, it tasted really bad, too.  It's been a long time since I couldn't finish an entree, but I left half the sandwich.)  The other guys with me thought their food was mediocre at best, and one couldn't finish her hummus because it had a weird flavor.  (I think they used really cheap minced garlic from a jar - had that weird jar garlic flavor.)

Oh, the bathrooms are weird, too.  They have a 2-way mirror that looks out on to the street, but that means they have to keep it really dark so people can't see in.  It's basically too dark to see where you're peeing; imagine trying to hit a bullseye by candlelight."}
{"text":"Service was good, the restaurant was nicely decorated and clean/modern. We would've expected more memorabilia from the steelers in there. The prices were reasonable for what you received. The Peorogi flatbread was delicious. The buffalo chicken sandwich wasn't anything special, but the grilled cheese was good. 

TL;DR good restaurant, would go again."}
{"text":"I think it is the best sports bar in Pittsburgh. the food is very good and the service rocks. i have been here many times for many different occasions and have never been dissapointed. I dont like Jerome Bettis personally ( I think he is a fake and I am not alone ) but his restaurant is a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"Not a bad place overall but don't come to it thinking you can get much of anything that is healthy.  

The deep fried pretzels are AMAZING.
Chipotle Turkey wrap (lunch special) is pretty good for what it is.

Prices are good.  One of the cheapest places we ate at in Pittsburgh and also one of my favorite."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is good.  Lots of tv's and multiple baseball games being shown.  Excellent beer selections on tap with a lot of local breweries being represented.  The food:  it wasn't bad - it was middle of the road at best.  The \"pierogies\" appetizer was odd.  My friend did have the steak and said it was really good and cooked perfectly.  I will go back and try something else for sure.  Good place to hang out.

And the 2-way mirror in the bathroom is interesting!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant to her three times in the past and it was great. I went in and the hostess sat me down outside. I could see the waiter and waitress walking around. Then they came out and sat at a table and had a conference. Then the hostess at a table of four. After the conference the waiter and Waitress got up and went over and waited on the other table. I gave them another five minutes then I got up and left. I will never go to this place again even though Jerome Bettis is one of my favorite players."}
{"text":"Location and the fact that it was a Notre Dame alumni were the best things about the restaurant. Beautiful stop by the River. We had drinks on the patio along with a salad and a burger. Food was good, drinks were cold, but the waiter gave a life story I could've done without. He was nice enough, but a 10 minute oration on your high school and then college track career was a little much. I don't remember asking!"}
{"text":"Love JB grill. Watched the super bowl there a couple of times. Steelers were 1-1. Good food and great atmosphere right by Heinz Field"}
{"text":"Stopped by Bettis for a drink and dessert. Amazing carrot cake! Great place, very hip!"}
{"text":"Stopped here before Pirates game.
First time here and will be the last.
From entering we got an attitude greeter that just was arrogant,maybe he was having a bad day.
Very dirty floors with food and napkins all over the place.
He sat us with menus and we waited and waited and finally a server who was not ours came over and asked what we wanted to drink,2 waters an ice tea and a beer.
Our actual waitress came with 1 water 1 ice tea and the beer.
I asked for my water as she asked us for an app order.We ordered the nachos.
She came back in a few minutes and we put in 2 burgers and an order of wings.
Few minutes went by and the nachos came and they was pretty good.
Then we waited for about 45 minutes and they kept saying the kitchen is a little messed up but we noticed that people who say after us had gotten their food already so we asked a few minutes later and still no food.
Manager came over and used the kitchen excuse and asked what they could do for us.
We said just bring out our food.
Finally came and was defiantly not worth the wait.
Burgers had a taste of dirty grill and just bland.
The tots I got were just not very good.
They gave us some money off as they seen we didn't eat most of it and told us please come back and try again.
Pretty sure we won't."}
{"text":"Look I love the bus but i don't think he would be happy about the way this is going. I'm sure he's collecting a nice check but it was a 2 hour wait I finally asked the lady and I along with the 3 groups in front of me we're all somehow off the list. When I finally got a seat no silverware. No drinks. 35 mins after sitting we received our appetizer still no silverware. I'm sitting here now it's been 20 mins since I've seen my waiter still no food we've been sitting for over an hour now. I stand corrected my food just got to the table next to me. Nothing good to say at this point."}
{"text":"Went here after a Pitt game.  This place was packed.  We went in to stand around the bar and the place stunk.  I don't mean there was a slight odor....the place smelled like the day after at a fraternity house.  There was beer spilled on the floor...everywhere...it was on the bartops, counters around the bar.  Took forever to get service.  Finally got a place at the bar and the girl that was good looking was just standing there.  Everyone else was doing the work and actually serving drinks.  Never got food because of such poor service.  I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Desperately average sports bar. Overpriced and with pretty crappy beer. Just b/c you add an \"e\" on the end of \"grill\" doesn't make it fancy. My hotel was nearby but I would never voluntarily go here."}
{"text":"I am a Life long Steelers fan. So my review might be slightly jaded, but this was a great experiences (yes I specifically said experience vs just a great restaurant.). I had the ahi tuna app, the deep fried pretzels and a caesar salad. All were very good, especially the tuna, but the tour of Jerome's private room was the icing on the cake.  The few of Hines field from my bar seat was just extra filling in my Steelers Twinkie ( sorry for all the metaphors). Just go and experience this place. Of course location is everything, but this is a true Steelers fan bar. I think the only thing that could have been better is seeing Jerome in person. Next time...."}
{"text":"Firecracker shrimp was pretty good. I had that with a side salad for my lunch and I was pretty happy with my choice. 
My friend had a chicken sandwich and it was good. His kid had the cheesy fries which she just picked at, you know kids...
The place is really nice and conveniently located down the street from the stadium. 
Bathrooms and restaurant was clean! Good service and good food."}
{"text":"This was my first experience here.  I went with some friends to watch the Pen's game.  We sat at the bar.  There were plenty of large screen TVs to look at.  Usually bar food isn't great, but I had a burger with barbecue sauce and bacon on it.  It was a great burger!  The fries were delicious too.  My only complaint was that if you weren't drinking beer, the drinks were very expensive!  $9.00 for a Royal Flush!  All in all, I'd go back."}
{"text":"I had a quesadilla and chicken salad.  The quesadilla was okay, while the chicken salad was great.  We sat inside and the music was a bit too loud to talk with my friend.  The outside seating area looked awesome, so we should have sat there.  The server was extremely friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Went here after a Steelers game along with a few hundred other people, it's right next to Heinz field.  Staff did a good job even though they were swamped, lots of TVs, even a few outside.  Saw lots of tasty looking food go by but was too busy drinking tequila to order any, couldn't tell you what the prices were but the Nacho plate was as big as a garbage can lid."}
{"text":"Nice selection of beer and upscale bar food.  Burgers are very good with a choice of brioche or wheat bun. It is that little extra touch that makes such a big difference! But my 5 star rating is due to its super dog friendly patio and wonderful staff! Perfect outdoor space with a grand view of the rivers. We were here on a Sunday as were four other patrons with dogs.  The staff and clientele could not be nicer! Kudos Bettis's!!! Thank you for being pet friendly!!! This may be my Sunday destination this summer! I'm impressed."}
{"text":"Great drink menu, great food. Good specials. Bartenders are super friendly! Have been there a few times and have always had a great experience. Lots of memorabilia to check out which makes it a great environment for the interested sports fan. All of their TVs indicate the games that will be played on them for the day too, so you can seat yourself accordingly. Love it!"}
{"text":"Being a Steelers Fan of course we had to try this place. We tried once before after a game and that was an error. The wait was longer than the Wall of China. So on another trip we came on a random day. There wasn't much of a wait (I think I used No Wait App). The place was still a little crowded but nothing too bad. The food was good and I decided to try something different - I did the fried burger (I know sounds crazy, right). The entire burger is fried. It was surprisedly good. The drinks could be a little better. Our waiter was amazing and was able to handle being seated back to back like a pro."}
{"text":"Went to Jerome's on Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The place wasn't crowded but the Pirates game was still going. Every TV in the place had a different baseball game which was awesome since I definitely enjoy watching baseball. 

I ordered the cheese flatbread which was actually very good and quite large. The Fiance ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was also quite tasty except that it was supposed to be on a kaiser roll but came out on a .25 hamburger bun. I definitely will visit again when I am back in the Burgh."}
{"text":"Spinach and Artichoke dip was great! The restaurant is nicely placed in the city, in quick walking distance from Heinz field, PNC park, Stage AE. Overall good service, and food!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sports bar food we've ever had - great river front location - caught the hockey game and loved the food. We chose two appetizers to share with draft beer - loved it and will go back next time we're in town. Good service too."}
{"text":"The hubby, a couple friends, and I went into Bettis after seeing everything else PACKED April 13th after the home opener at PNC park. They were packed too, but just seemed a bit more promising as far as getting some drinks. We were lucky enough to grab a table, and ate too. We had seared tuna, and some sort of BLT with avocado and chicken, the food was all good, but the start of the show was out server Kasey. They  were filled, hardly even room to walk, and she managed to keep our drinks filled the whole time. She was attentive as if they weren't even busy. We've all been in the industry for years and know how it is on big days like that to run your ass off, kudos Kasey!"}
{"text":"Great food cold beer and awesome customer service.  We are visiting from out of town and wanted to watch a college basketball game that wasn't on locally they found the game put it on the tv close to where we were sitting. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh on business, and a friend suggested this place.  The food was nothing special, but the place itself is pretty cool.  TVs everywhere, a two way mirror in the men's room, and good service.  Pretty typical food, nothing special- not bad, not great.  Our server was mad cool.  For his service alone, I'd bump it up to a 3.5."}
{"text":"I realize the term \"sports bar\" can mean just about anything nowadays, but I wanted to finally check out JBG36 after a long afternoon of snacking at the ballpark. I can't comment on the interior restaurant because we opted for an outside table. Maybe that's good, maybe that's bad, but either way I was pleased.

The drink list, as well as the menu, was more extensive and varied than I first assumed, with decent selections of draft beers and mixed drinks. I decided on the Turkey Burger with sweet potato fries, which were both very good. For dessert: Turtle cheesecake...excellent! 

As far as the service, the waiter was very personable and friendly throughout the meal even though he was very busy with numerous tables. Prices were surprisingly reasonable as well.

Spending a warm, beautiful evening outside, eating/drinking on the North Shore and admiring the Point and city skyline sunset was a great way to end the day."}
{"text":"This place is better than I expected.  Food is quite good.  As you would expect, they have a huge bar, with a decent list of beers on tap.  It's large, well laid-out, and has lots of tables and seating, so they can accommodate lots of customers.

Service is generally quite good, friendly, helpful, and not pretentious in the least.  They do get a bit slow during busier times, which is one area that could improve.  And, yes, it is a touch pricy, but location, location, location!  Jerome and team have invested in a great location and have outfitted it nicely.

FUN FACT:  The Men's room has one-way glass above waist-height above the urinals.  First time whizzers are surprised to be looking out over the hostess stand and the bar, and inevitably will double check that glass when they walk out (to make sure you can't see in)!"}
{"text":"So.....Jerome Bettis Grille 36....it is what it is (or trying to be) - an upscale sports bar.  I made my first stop here before a Pirates game on a rainy evening.  There were good things and bad, but after reading other reviews and marinating on my own experience, I'm landing on 3 stars.  I'd give an extra half star if I could. 

I don't know why exactly I thought it wouldn't be crowded.  Sure, it was a Saturday evening.  And yeah, okay, the Pirates were playing at home.  But the weather wasn't great and I'm pretty sure there were more people here than at the game I went to later.  However given other North Shore restaurant options, this is probably the best.  

Not that I hated it at all.  As I stood around with my friends waiting for a table, we watched many tasty looking dishes taken into the dining room.  I was tempted to start grabbing bites as the plates were carried past by unassuming waiters.  Needless to say, we were kind of hungry.  So when a few seats opened on the bar side, we decided to sit there and avoid a long wait for a table.  To hell with civility.

Our waitress, once we established who would be taking our order, was very friendly.  Our drinks were never empty and she helped us navigate through some of the choices on the menu.  (Originally I thought about ordering two dinners just because I couldn't decide.)  I ordered Our Ginormous BLT Double Grilled Cheese Ranch Burger - recommended by our waitress above the deep fried burger.  She said what I got was her favorite, but by the looks of her, she didn't eat too many of them.  We also ordered the Deep Fried Pretzels and Buffalo Shrimp Wontons for appetizers.  My friends also ordered from the burger options.  The Deep Fried Pretzels were pretty good, but the Buffalo Shrimp Wontons were pretty stellar.  My burger was just okay, mostly because I ordered it medium and it was charred.  

Overall, though, we had a pleasant experience.  Great service and reasonable prices for good food.  And because I only ordered one entree, I will be back to try the others I resisted in ordering the first time."}
{"text":"We stopped in after the Chesney concert at Heinz field, we came in at the tail end of their rush, we were sat Ina fair amount of time, 20 min, enjoyed some drinks at the bar and had really spectacular nachos, once we were sat the story changed completely. We ordered 5 burgers and a chicken sandwich, our food literally took 1.25 hours to come out. We were told sorry... It's been a long day.. No kidding.. Us too. Not only did the food take too long it came out wrong, cold and staggered. Again.. Burgers, how exactly does that even happen. We were so disgusted with our incredibly late, cold, wrong food that we barely ate. Who knows how long a cold burger had sat out before it made it to our table. The manager apologized for the 'kitchen dropping the ball' and comp'd our meal but... It should have been comp'd. This experience literally ruined our night as we wasted lots of time waiting then were left still hungry and in search of yet something else to eat. May be a ok place to go when it's not busy but I wouldn't count on anything if its after any kind of event. Also... Men's bathroom tries too hard to be cool and is just plain creepy."}
{"text":"We had an okay experience here. Our server was nice, but we didn't stay long. Looking at the menu, there was lots to pick from, but in the past, we've only really had satisfactory experiences with the food. For this reason, we decided to not order food but stick with drinks. 

We were seated outside and it was a beautiful day. Upon entering, we were told we would have to wait 20 minutes for a table outside, but it was more like 20 seconds, which was nice. The beer menu didn't have prices on it, so that was a little inconvenient. The cheapest special they had for the holiday weekend was $4 Miller. We each drank a beer and left, due to this. It was a nice atmosphere and good service, but if you're looking for good, reasonably priced drinks and food specials, this is not the spot. Although, I'd stop back for Happy hour, if that makes a difference."}
{"text":"Came here after it first opened.  New, clean and hot new place. Tonight place was terrible. Bathrooms not cleaned. Service mediocre. Not same no pride."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go! The bartender, Will, was absolutely phenomenal and went the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable for our visit. We had the pretzels and the shrimp tacos, both were delicious. Amongst the various beers I had and the martinis she had (which we both loved), we topped the night off with a unique, yet tasty, pancake shot! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We were here on a Friday night before the Steelers Colts game that is happening on Sunday night. It was about 1/3 full. The waitstaff was very good, we got our drinks and our food quickly. Everything seemed fairly priced to me. It is a pretty cool atmosphere. We met some really nice people and talked for several hours about the city of Pittsburgh. It was Fun!"}
{"text":"There is no excuse for the absolutely poor service I experienced. I sat at the bar, while the bartender kicked her leg up on the ice container and waited more than patiently for her to acknowledge me. From there, she proceeded to never give me the water I asked for in accompaniment with my drink and messed up my food order. The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because their sweet potatoes fries are the best I have ever had!!! The mixture of cinnamon and sugar they are baked in is heavenly. You also can't go wrong with their mini pierogis. Deep fried pierogis topped with caramelized onions and scallions. Also, delicious!"}
{"text":"I personally love steak, anytime I go out and there's steak on the menu, more specifically rib eye, you best believe that's what I'm ordering. That being said, Jerome Bettis Grille makes a good a** rib eye!! I order my steaks rare and this steak was just perfect! Sided it up with veggies. The steak was so big it was truthfully bigger than my head! I could not finish the whole thing in one meal, but that just means I get to finish it for lunch the following day :) can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop at prior to kickoff. Fair prices on beer and the food is good. I got the Chicken and Waffles, which I would highly recommend. I will be back, no doubt."}
{"text":"The food was less than average. Had a small salad and pomegranate salmon.  The salmon was seared perfectly but the pomegranate sauce was barely a drop.  Typical cut up squash for veggies with WAY too much raw onion. And some boiled fingerlings with no seasoning, just fell flat. Will not go back unless for beer and wings. This is really just a low level sports bar. I think TGIF may be better."}
{"text":"I have been a Pittsburgh Steelers Fan since I was 5, born and raised in Virginia, and now live in Minnesota, I eat, live, and breath Pittsburgh, I was able to finally get to Pittsburgh for the 1st time in my life and was able to see the stadium and got to visit Jerome Bettis's Restaurant, so glad I did!  The Black & Gold Boneless Wings were to die for, made my day finally getting to Pittsburgh!  Great place, very friendly bar staff!"}
{"text":"You will not find a better location, especially when seated outside.  What a wonderful view of the Allegheny River and the Point.  

There are some things Grille 36 makes that are very, very, good, such as their Mac 'n' Cheese.  I also like their steak salad.  Overall, their food is inconsistent.

A little bit of trivia, there is a 2 way mirror in the men's room, the men can see out into the restaurant.  The same mirror was installed in the women's room, but with the lighting turned up, people could see in.  But they had complaints when they turned the lighting down, women complained and the see through mirror was removed."}
{"text":"We waited for over an hour for our food. The waitress was grumpy. And the food was so gross. White fish for the fish and chips. Ew. And the chicken tacos were overly spicy with no flavor but spice. They actually had some odd green sauce on them that looked like a baby pooped on my tacos. I would suggest that u eat anywhere else than here."}
{"text":"Ordered the Southwest Club and  specifically asked if the turkey was cold cuts or real turkey - told turkey was real, total cold cuts- gross.  Ate at the bar -- bartender had zero sense of humor -- seemed like a robot.  Ended up with a Caesars said - you can't mess that up."}
{"text":"Always highly skeptical of any celebrity joints...because you know how it is, the celeb lends their name to a glorified TGI Fridays and then it all goes down hill.

Though for this neighborhood and how long they've been going at it, Bettis has a restaurant he can be proud to put attach his name.

My co-workers were all excited to go to McFadden's as it was close to PNC Park, but I saw the 2-star Yelp review average and said no thanks.  Ended up just down the street at Jerome's Grille 36.

The service is generally good, the food is actually edible.  Had a great burger, wonderful fries and lots of drink refills.

Only negative was some fruit flies at the bar.

The bathrooms are a total trip.  Funky lighting, super dark.  Like you're on a drug trip."}
{"text":"Drinks were good. Food was good. But overall seemed like a chain restaurant. Absolutely loved all the tvs especially because it was super bowl Sunday. Every table along the walls had its own tv to view the game. Very nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is the second and last time we will eat at Jerome Bettis' Grille 36. We ordered the nachos with the guacamole on top as an appetizer for 4 people. The server brought four appetizer plates and walked away. The guacamole was not included and when we asked and the server returned with it, was practically a thimble full for an entire plate of nachos. Two of the four plates were dirty and coated in a red sauce. We had to wait several minutes for the server to return to get clean plates. The tortilla chips were caked in salt and practically inedible - and I like salt but this was gross. The side salads were brought out with the meals instead of before them. The corn tortillas for the mahi mahi were split in half upon arrival. Someone in my party accidentally spilled his water and was all over the tables and filled one of the plates. Luckily the table next to us grabbed napkins and helped to sop up the mess. When our waiter finally did come over, he scanned the table and asked if we were alright but never actually cleaned up the puddles of water until he was ready to clear the table. Start to finish, this restaurant and the staff was a huge disappointment. We are four people who will never be back."}
{"text":"Coming down from Western NY for a Monday Pirates game vs. the Braves, who I rarely get to see, my brother and I wanted to make a day of it. After doing some research of the sports bar/grills that populate the area around PNC Park and Heinz Field, Jerome Bettis' seemed like our best bet, though no place had crazy outstanding reviews. We'll let it slide that the Steelers beat our Bills just two days before!

Entering at around 3:30pm after a 3 hour drive we were seated quickly at a hi-top table in the bar. Lots of TV and we liked that they had the TVs \"pre-labled\" with which games would be showing on them in the evening. I had a nice view out the patio at the WWII memorial as well as the Fountain across the river. It was already pretty bustling with Pirates fans and a few of our fellow friends from Braves Country.

Toi was our waitress and was very pleasant and quick with service, even if my brother's NY Drivers License confused her when looking for his birthday :).  My brother and I both started with draft beers. They have large glasses for the $7.50 range and a wide selection of PA local and general favorites on draft. 

I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Biscuit \"Sliders\" and my brother got the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger with the sauce on the side. Our food came out very quickly and was freshly made and piping hot. I sort of had low expectations for biscuits made at a sports bar, but I have to say I was very impressed. They were warm, flaky, and held together even with the BBQ sauce. The pulled pork was moist and tender and the BBQ sauce which was layered on top was nothing out of this world, but still very tangy and a good compliment. Not too spicy or salty. There were lightly battered/fried thin onion \"strings\" on it. Those were a little tough. Might be better to have them chopped because they were hard to bite through. With a small side of basic fries, it was a filling meal. 

My brother chowed down on the cheeseburger, dipping it in the BBQ sauce. He ordered it medium rare and said it was perfectly done. Good amount of toppings, large overall burger, and I could see the bacon sticking out of every side. Had a higher end, large soft bakery roll. He ate every little bit while hardly talking so I would consider that a success.

Prices for downtown/near stadium food are to be expected. It was $13 for my two biscuit sliders and $12 for the burger. I think mine was a little over priced for the size, but it was still good. I did like that they had quite a few fancier salads and vegetarian items. I always take note since my mom is a vegetarian and it is rare sports bar place has these, so I would recommend it here if you have a veggie eater in your group.

The bathrooms were oddly weird... my brother went when we got there and said it was \"like a club\". I went when we left and it was SO dark in there. I had to use my phone's flashlight app to find something in my purse. Very strange considering the rest of the restaurant is not like that."}
{"text":"This is a cool trendy place on the North Shore.

I was playing Pokemon Go all day and they were the only restaurant and bar open for food at Midnight. 

They have several rooms and a bar and patio.

I ordered the firecracker shrimp which was good and was a large portion like most of their food. Everything  here is large portioned so be prepared to eat.

Their firecracker shrimp was good but wasn't as sweet as others. I would eat here again. The men's bathroom is a must see!"}
{"text":"So we've now went to Jermoe Bettis Grille 36 4 times to keep trying it and officially are DONE with it. Every time, it's mediocore at very best. 

Second time we went we took Steeler fans from out of town who wanted to try it because well they loved The Bus and love the Steelers. So we went. All ordered the cavatapi mac and cheese. All 3 were cold to the point that the shredded cheese they put on top not only didn't melt it was still cold throughout. Gave it a stir. Still cold througout. Sent back and ordered buffalo chicken tenders. Came out like fryer had never been changed in a year - had that burnt taste to the breading, and they came out cold. Allow me to mention I hate my food too hot anyways so it has to be colder than hell before I'll notice. 

Third time we ordered the nacho tower thingie. Mound of chips. Well it's huge. But once you get one inch into the nachos, you have 4-5 inches of chips left and no toppings. And again - cold. Cheese is melted a touch but rest of toppings are cold and make it cold as well. Wife ordered one of the deep fried hoagies. INteresting I suppose. But cold in the middle, what a trend here. 

Fourth and FINAL time we went - here recently. Got a wild hair and decided to go in for appetizers. Got the firecracker shrimp thingie appetizer, and the breading all came off the shrimp. None of it stuck. Then our chicken tenders were not fully cooked in the middle. I kid you not they were pink.

We're done. We wanted it to be good since we're homeowners downtown. But with all the new great places opening up we don't need it to anymore. Besides the game day crowd will keep it open me thinks. But it really is pretty mediocre food. And not in a good way. 

Service wise - not too bad actually. Rather attentive actually. Oh and the mens room, make a trip just for that. The urinals are below a two way mirror. You are behind hostess stand about 2-3 feet from other patrons staring right at them as you piss. It's awesome. You're looking right at them through the two way mirror as you handle your business. Coolest bathroom ever. Food wise - just don't go."}
{"text":"The bar is loud and has every sport possible playing on multiple screens. If you are looking for a place to grab a d drink and munch on something with your friends then this is the right place. Plenty of stand up tables as well as a big bar. The place still gets full!"}
{"text":"I love The Bus as much as the next Pittsburgher, but I normally stay away from celebrity endorsed restaurants as they strike me as fancy Applebees.

Our group came here due to proximity to our hotel, and to the Grille's credit they had our group of 14 seated before we could finish a beer at the bar.

The menu was pretty standard, and most of us stuck to burgers. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food, and they dedicated two servers to our table who did a great job.*

Why only 3 stars? Well the seating area was pretty dirty with crap and food debris all over the floor. I know Bettis' mom personally** and I'm sure she would not have been happy with the cleanliness.

Also, the 2-way mirror in the mens bathroom allows you creep on the hostess desk/entire restaurant while you pee. I'm a creep so I liked this, but it just felt so wrong.

{"text":"Took a group of 20 for lunch.They accommodated us with amazing service. The food was delicious. Naturally there was a variety of food due to the number of people, and all commented that they want to return!"}
{"text":"A must to go to this place when there is a game. So many people, but great atmosphere! I had the burger which was really good."}
{"text":"Food is great..delicious!! Environment on point,.. clean, energetic, friendly. Only thing is.. a little unorganized.  Yes, very busy as the wait time was a while, but understandable as it was a game day, they use an app to tell your place in line.. I'm a fan :) but once seated the friendly server took our order, app came out fast, before our drinks and no app plates...and not with our other app we ordered. But once we tasted it all.. absolutely delish!! Definitely be back in the future!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Pirates game day about 2 hours before the game. Luckily we found some seats at the bar to eat & drink( the wait for a table was over a hour). 
We ordered a few appetizers and beers. It only took about 15-20 min to get our food, I thought much longer since their wait was so long. Our waitress was on top of everything, our glasses never were empty. Food was aright, pretzel sticks were AMAZING, get those if you're getting a app. The bones less wings- are really not wings, but chicken tenders with wing sauce. Buffalo chicken flat bread was good. THEY HAVE BANANA BREAD BEER!!! GET IT! 
The inside of the restaurant is obviously sports themed. LOUD atmosphere, there were children there, it's family friendly if you want to bring your kid to a bar.  Bathrooms are ok, little dark."}
{"text":"This bar has a nice decor honoring the Steelers and their great Jerome Bettis. The bar is large in the venue and seats many comfortably. There is also seating indoors and outdoors to enjoy a beverage and dine. When outdoors or near the rear of the restaurant you can enjoy a view of Pittsburgh's rivers.

They have a good selection of beers, wines, and cocktails.

One interesting item is the \"spying\" window in the men's restroom. When taking a leak, the urinals double as an observation deck for the bar.

Unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to sample the food during our visit, but hope to on a future visit."}
{"text":"I love this place. Definitely my favorite spot on the North Shore. Just went here yesterday while biking on the Pittsburgh bike trails. Stopped with my wife and two young children. I had the fish and chips. My wife had a buffalo chicken sandwich and my kids split chicken fingers. For the appetizer we had loaded nachos. Great day and great meal."}
{"text":"On our first visit, we had to wait for over an hour to be seated and could barely find a place to stand while we waited. Once we finally sat down and got our food I was very disappointed. Usually when a place charges this much for food they tend to use higher quality ingredients. Not here. I sampled food from a number of people's plates and was let down each time. The ribs I got were fatty and tough and the other food I tried was no better. What a let down.

We have returned a few times but only to have drinks and those were very good."}
{"text":"Zero stars. We came here for dinner last Thursday. There were four of us and there was no wait. The waitress tried to seat us at a table with only three chairs, without finding us a fourth chair. I guess one person was supposed to sit on the floor. Then we asked to move to another table, and instead of saying that was ok, she responded that would be a different server. I am not sure why we cared, except our service turned out to be terrible.  Maybe she was trying to save us from that, but I highly doubt she was thinking of us. It took us forever to get our food, and the server was not friendly at all. I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup. The \"soup\" came in a container the size of a side salad dressing. I was expecting an actual bowl of soup. The sandwich and salad dressing/soup were cold. I'm not sure if we were being punished for moving tables, or if it was always that bad. There are way better places to eat in Pittsburgh. Don't waste your hard earned money here.  This place is living off a name only. It's a tourist trap.  Bad food, even worse service."}
{"text":"If you're a Steelers fan, how could you not eat here? 

Well I am a Steelers fan and I did.

On first impression, it is a very nice place- clean and sharp in its decor. The menu has a pretty diverse selection of food, though most would fall into the category of \"American\".

Starting with the chips and salsa, I was excited to hear the salsa was home made. What came out wasn't exactly salsa, but more of a bowl of diced tomatoes with a sprinkling of other ingredients. Not spicy at all. Just tomatoey. Not impressed.

I had the llama burger which was the meat featured on Friday. I ordered it with the recommended Cajun mayo and sweet potato fries. it was pretty damn good. Not the best burger ever, but pretty good.

My buddy got the buffalo chicken burger which apparently was not even good enough to finish... and he always finishes.

So this isn't anything special as far as restaurants go, but it seems like a great sports bar. IF you can find parking."}
{"text":"Bettis' is a fun atmosphere when you come during a sporting event. The bar will be packed, patrons noisy and loud cheering for Pitt or the Steelers. Lots of screens to watch and it's not too too hard to get a drink at the bar even when it's crowded.

The food is pretty standard; nothing great even for bar grub - fried stuff, nachos, quesadillas, wraps, sandwiches and a few fancier looking items to round out the menu.

Overall, the only time to come to Bettis' is when there's a corresponding game going on. It's a nice establishment, yes, but there are much better places around town if you want a proper meal, even by pub fare standards."}
{"text":"We came in for an early dinner and had a great time! Toi was our server and she was phenomenal -- very knowledgeable about the menu and attentive. We have 2 twin baby girls that are not easy to dine with and she was awesome. She even held one for a quick minute to give us 60 seconds of peace! :) Several other servers, food runners, and managers stopped by to check on us during our meal. The Bus has clearly created a family at his restaurant and made us feel at home! Thanks to everyone who was a part of our night!"}
{"text":"Deep fried italian hoagie, giant slice of carrot cake, two way mirror in the pisser?  This place rocks, plus, who doesn't like bussy?"}
{"text":"My server was lovely and was very attentive. My food was great although the portions are large and heavy. A bit of a louder atmosphere but good overall. One problem I had was the kitchen manager that kept walking back in forth through the main dining room with a green flossing stick hanging out his mouth which was gross in my view. Good restaurant, solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Went on the 4th of July we expected a long wait but it really wasn't that long, food was great and so was the service ...def be back"}
{"text":"The prices are right but the food is less than exciting. My husband works on the North Shore so we were looking for more lunch options other than SoHo because it is a bit expensive there. We ordered the same items that we had ordered at SoHo the day before and noticed they were a few dollars cheaper. So far, so good. However, when we got them, we realized why. We got a chicken caesar salad and a turkey avocado sandwich. The quality is mediocre and the taste isn't the best. The quality of the meat was definitely lower than we were expecting and overall, it didn't seem worth it. However, the service and ambience were great! I could see us coming back before or after a game or concert, though!"}
{"text":"I had the fried hoagie- a MUST!! My husband had the spicy shrimp appetizer, he was really impressed with the amount of shrimp. Our waiter Shakur was a real sweetie. Next time we are Pittsburgh we will visit The Bus's place."}
{"text":"As a HUGE Steelers fan, every trip to da Burgh includes a stop at Bettis's.  

The food is . . . good (not great).  

I've seen Jerome in there more than a couple times (which is nice).  

As a Steelers fan, it's just something ya gotta do.  It's located just a hundred or so yards from Heinz Field.  It's THE place to catch the early games while standing at the bar pounding Iron City's as you wait to enter Heinz for the 4pm or prime time kickoffs. 

They offer a 36oz steak if you've got your inner Adam Richman going on.  

I wouldn't go there for the food if it wasn't Jerome Bettis's place.  But, it is, so I do.  

Go Stillers!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to the restaurant for some snacks after attending an event. Our server was excellent: very friendly, quick, and accommodating. Our table split nachos, fried pretzels, chicken tenders, and bacon wrapped stuffed jalape√±os. Everything was so delicious and the portions were huge. I would go back as soon as possible to try even more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"Let me set the story...  It was a midsummer's eve and all was quiet on the street.   After having a lack luster happy hour next door at the Tilted Kilt - I decided to get my food on.

What did I have, say you?    I had a cheeseburger.   It was not just any cheeseburger.   It was a DEEP FRIED CHEESEBURGER

Let me say this about the cheeseburger.   The cheeseburger probably would have been really bad if it had not been DEEP FRIED (I feel like I have to capitalize because it was really good).

I believe I will eat everything DEEP FRIED for the rest of my life as soon as they make a difibulator smaller than my iPod Nano

The food was good - $8-23 for entrees
The atmosphere was okay (it was really quiet but I blame the economy)
The drinks were good 

I say support your teams and your businesses.   I will go there again (and try the DEEP FRIED Hoagie - yes they have one of those too :-)) on my way to my meeting with Jenny Craig

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First of all, I love The Bus and love the decor in this place.  The problems that I have with the place is that they keep changing the menu.  The past couple of times I've been there, the two things I liked most, they got rid of.  I hate it when restaurants do this!  TGI Fridays and Romano's Macaroni Grill are two of the biggest culprits of this!  The last time I was in there, the place had a BAD issue with flies.  Two of them landed on my fries.  They did get me a new order of fries, but that's besides the point.  You've gotta address that issue, because if there's flies, there could be roaches or rats.  It opens the door for a bad precedent.  Also, the last time I was in there, two of the TV's in my area weren't working, and they had billiards or something like that on, instead of other baseball games (the Pirates were off that night).  However, most of the food I've had is enjoyable.  The service isn't fast, but they are nice.  The bathroom is very cool.  When you're standing at the urinals, you can look out into the bar area and see the TV's (they cannot look in and see you though).  And of course, you'll have to pay to park.  It's best to go on Pirates, Steelers, or Panthers game day, or if you're going to a concert at PNC or Heinz, because you're already paying to park.  It can just get very busy in there."}
{"text":"We came here after the Polar Bear Plunge and got some appetizers and a couple drinks. We asked the bartender for a pancake shot and she didn't know how to make it so her recommendation was a Washington apple instead--not exactly what we were looking for, maybe she was new? The place has a bajillion tvs and is very nicely decorated. I'd like to go back during regular business hours."}
{"text":"Great food and okay service. I've eaten there a few times, but just tried the chicken (something I often avoid in restaurants) and the Asian chicken salad was wonderful - the chicken was perfectly prepared. Not common in a bar restaurant. Whoever partnered with Jerome Bettis to create this restaurant did a great job. The food is always wonderful and the selections almost all look good. I haven't tried everything yet, but it's in a great location for concerts and games, so we'll keep going back."}
{"text":"Great place to visit of you're a Steelers fan! awesome vibe from all the people, wouldn't recommend the food.  I tried the fried cheeseburger, mainly because i wanted to know what a fried cheeseburger would taste like, and you guessed it, wasn't that great.  Would recommend just visiting this place for beer and appetizers and getting dinner else where."}
{"text":"I had dinner here during Super Bowl Sunday. Steak. Perfectly cooked. Draught beers - lots of choices. A mile walk from my hotel, but worth the hike. Service was excellent. Prices - a little high I think, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at the \"Bus's\" restaurant. (I'm a Dolphins fan; it takes a lot to compliment a steak place without having complimented Shula's in Florida)."}
{"text":"Great place for pre game excitement - stopped in Saturday before the Game on Sunday - packed, everybody happy, staff was great - we just had appetizers, pictures with the STEELER Pope- food was great! Would defiantly return!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and although I cannot say that I have ever been blown away by amazing food or service, I cannot complain.  Typical run of the mill sports bar and grill.  

Any time I go, I am content.  Food is good, nothing amazing that makes me want to come back for me, but things are always cooked as asked and the staff is always nice and friendly.  No complaints there. 

If you are going to an event in the North Shore area, this is one of the better places to go in that area.  Beats a lot of the other options!"}
{"text":"So my family and I drove to Pittsburgh to watch the Steelers vs Bengals game since it was blacked out in our viewing area.  After some searching and talking to the concierge at the Wyndham we decided to head over to Grille 36.  We were a little apprehensive because of some of the reviews, but wanted to give our oldest a chance to see the stadium up close.  

We had the BEST time and will be going back (despite the 5 hour drive) sooner the later.  Our party of 5 was made up of 4 Steelers fans and 1 Bengals fan (and 3 of the 5 were children ranging from toddler to teen).   The atmosphere and the staff were great.  They had a fantasy football game and gave out bracelets to the kids.  Sure everyone picked on my poor Bengals fan husband, but it was all fun and goodnatured and he wasn't the only Bengals fan in the building.  He even remarked how cool everyone had been once we'd left.

As far as the food goes the best I can come up with as far as a complaint is that the nachos were only so so and probably not worth the price.  Other than that we had 2 orders of the wings, dry with 3 different sauces (at our excellent servers suggestion), 2 orders of the fried pretzel sticks, the breakfast burger, the deep fried burger, the horseradish cheddar burger, the carrot cake and the chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cake. All were wonderful.

We were expecting the price to be on the expensive end, but despite all the food we had, plus drinks, including a tip we still priced out at under $200.  

My introduction to the Steelers was with the Bus and he has always been my mothers favorite.  When we left Grille 36 I made sure to call her and tell her it was the greatest day EVER!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Pittsburgh,  and I typically stay at the Hyatt Place Northshore...I hit up Bettis 36!  Food is good, staff is cool as sh*t!  If the weather is nice, sit outside and take a few cold ones back with a great view of the water and Mt. Washington."}
{"text":"Very good service and food, Hugh variety of menus and they do have lower fat choices to choose from,vi had large salad with chicken and shrimp with fat free black raspberry dressing, very good, also had the grilled chicken sandwich with buff sauce on it, for the price it's great nice size portions , it is a bar for all those complaining bout noise, but I also saw many families enjoying the atmosphere , w"}
{"text":"Just stopped for a late lunch.  Was told we would have a 30 minutes wait.  There were 8 empty tables outside and at least 5 inside.  Told that people are coming in. So we left. Called 15 minutes later and told there is no wait come on in.  Apparently 40!people cancelled their reservation in the course of a quarter hour. 

May never go back."}
{"text":"Great food knowledgeable staff really likable staff so the expectation of good food and good service is met. Plenty to see in the downtown area around the grill also so it's definitely if you're in Pittsburgh a place to stop."}
{"text":"Don't expect to get the advertised beer special.
They advertise $4.00 Miller Lites all day every day but actually cost $5.25.
I informed the bartender but they didn't give a shit."}
{"text":"The 4 stars isn't for the food, that was just OK (greek salad & hummus plate), it's for the atmosphere.  Especially if you are a Steeler/Bus fan.  I loved the full wall mural of him driving the ball.  I love the framed notes of good luck.  I loved the lights underneath the sinks in the ladies room and I loved the VIP room.  I so want to be invited into there!  Also, the beers are big!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was packed with people, probably because of the location. Thankfully I did not have to wait too long to get a table. The menu had items such as wings, salads, burgers, new york strip steak, and salmon. I ordered the pierogie flatbread. The service was very slow, and the food tasted average. I am not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"First time here and I ask the waitress for a mudslide martini and the bartender served it in a rocks glass, wrong glass but tasty. We ordered chips and queso for an app the queso tasted like an old boot and was cold and and the salsa looked old and tasted like metal. Then we both decided to order the deep fried cheese burger just for giggles and it was awful, over cooked and no flavor what so ever. We never got checked on after our food came. Waitress was very inattentive."}
{"text":"This place is literally right next to Heinz Field. If you're coming here on game day, good luck getting a seat. Good luck even walking around inside. Even after the game, there's a long wait to get food and even inside the restaurant. But I mean, what do you expect when the owner is Jerome Bettis and you have a place right next to Heinz Field. I usually would take a star away for being overpacked but not here. So the last time I was back for a Steelers game, we hit this place up after pregaming hard in one of the red lots. Well. About 1.5 hrs until they opened the doors, we went to this place. I've heard quite a bit it here but never actually experienced it. We waited 30 minutes to even get inside. And once inside, it was hard to manoever aroud. I have no idea how we managed to snag a booth but we got a booth for 4 which was awesome. We ordered a plate of the nachos and a ton of beer. 

Guys, you have to check out the bathroom here. It's a one way mirror. You can see out of the bathroom while peeing and see everyone else drinking oblivious to the fact that you are taking care of business and they can't see you at all. 

Well. After the game, we came back for a late night dinner. The steelers won of course and everyone was really happy. The line up outside was probably about 45 minutes long but we waited 5 minutes to get inside. Here's a secret. If you say you're going to be drinking outside, you can just cut in front of everyone by walking to the outside drinking area then walk inside and a get a table. 

So once we got our table for 10, we started ordering. I saw a deep fried cheeseburger and just knew that I had to get it. I mean. I probably had about 30 beers during the course of the day along with nachos, primanti brothers during half time, de luca's works for breakfast so what's a deep fried cheeseburger going to do? Might as well go all out with the calorie count. So I got the cheeseburger and figured that it would be disgusting but I had to try it. My my ... was it awesome. I have no idea how they did it but the cheese just melted in your mouth. The burger was tender and juicy and the lettuce, tomatoes and onions were not touched at all. 

I am def. coming back here for game day next time but will have to get here hours in advance to get a good table."}
{"text":"Many years ago, I went to Grille 36 prior to a game and was so overwhelmed by the crowds that I never got my beer and had to walk out.  It wasn't their fault; I am just simply ridiculous in large crowds.

I finally made it back here for an actual experience this November.  I went with my sister and brother-in-law and we decided to have a small lunch and beer here after a long day shopping and playing around in PGH.  

Grille 36 has a decent craft beer menu (including many local brews) and I opted for a Church Works beer and decided to forego food, although I did pick at my sister's edamame (which were good, but not salty enough).  

It was lunchtime during the week and the place wasn't very crowded and we easily got a seat at the bar.

I would love to write more about this place, but nothing really stands out for good or bad reasons.  It was just another sports bar that happens to be owned by a legend and situated beside Heinz Field.  That is definitely its appeal."}
{"text":"Large esports bar a stones throw from the stadium. Fun surprise at the restrooms with the see-through windows. :)

Food-wise this place does not dissappoint. The \"deep fried cheeseburger\" is something I just had to try as a European.. and it lived up to all its epic expectations. 

Next time I'm looking forward to try either the Burger 36 or the BBQ Bacon."}
{"text":"My fianc√© went to Notre dame and is from Pittsburgh, so he's a big fan of everything Bettis.  We found ourselves in the area after a visit to the Science Center and decided to give it a try.  We were told there world be a 45 minute wait, but it ended up being more like 15 or 20.  Once seated, I noticed the large number of TVs and how they were labeled with which hockey games they were showing.  Being from Buffalo and a huge Sabres fan, I was delighted when they changed one of the TVs to show my game.  
The menu ranges from typical bar food to fairly gourmet selections.  Despite a grilled chicken option sounding very tasty, I opted for something that I highly doubt I can find anywhere else - the deep fried cheeseburger.  Am I glad I tried it?  Yes.  Would I ever have it again?  No.  It had a tempura type batter on it and it was HUGE.  Certainly a fork and knife sort of burger.  It was tasty and they burger was moist without the trimmings being soggy.  But it is very filling.  

And apparently the men's bathroom has a mirror that you can see out to the bar so you don't miss any of the game action. Strange, but I guess just something else that makes Bettis's memorable.

Will I go back to Berttis's?  Sure.  I'll just be sensible and order the chicken."}
{"text":"Food is gross! Pulled pork sandwich was so dry it tasted like what I would expect dirt to taste like. Wanted to order tortilla soup, the waitress said \"it's gross today, don't bother\", service was horrible and she brought our check before I finished 1/2 of my meal."}
{"text":"First time here in Pittsburgh and this was on our list of places to stop and so glad we did. The atmosphere, food, everything about it was nothing but perfection. I really wish I remembered out waitresses name she was so helpful on suggesting some drinks for us to try. We had the pleasure of meeting the floor manager Jason and he was such a great help. Since we came from out of town he was so helpful on suggesting places in the area to view before we head home and he gave us a tour of the place. My husband and I will definitely be going back before we leave back home. I 100% recommend this place if your looking for drinks and some amazing food."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!!!! If you like to wait this is the place for you. When we got there with a party of 6, we were told 30 to 45 minutes. After waiting over an hour we were told that they were cleaning a table. Meanwhile there was a large empty table. Another large party that was standing next to us were given that table even though their yelp app said no parties ahead of us. We asked again and were finally seated. When the waitress came to take our order we were told it would take 45 minutes to get our food. At that time we said \"see you later!\""}
{"text":"Came into town for the Monday night game and were else would you go for some pre- game, but to the Jerome Bettiss' Grille. Read some of the earlier reviews and got kind of nervous.  However all I can say to that is, it's a sports bar, they serve beer and it's awesome. Came in a few hours before the game hoping it would be packed and it was, Steeler nation was in the house. Lot of T.Vs to watch and a nice gated outdoor area to hang out it. Not a better place to get warmed up, ramped up, and ready for Heinz field!

Beer is cold and food is exactly what I want out of a sports bar.  Had the Bulgogi and some wings for some dinner and they were both delicious.  Bulgogi came in a flour tortilla with a wasabi slaw and a spicy Asian chili sauce.  Wings came in orders of 9, 18, and 36, so I went with 18 with the hot garlic parm sauce. With all those wings I had to drink plenty of beer to wash them down with.  The bar had my favorite on draft magic hat #9 and all six were just as good. Each one even got a little better. 

Jerome Bettis Grille was exactly what I was looking for, great atmosphere, great people and great Service.  If you're looking for a fine dining experience, a quiet place to be with your friends, and a lame night probably not the place for you. If you want to rock out with some great Steelers fans then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The food is average at best. They have good beer and a great view from the outside. I will not visit here again if I cannot sit outside and/or if I'm not drinking."}
{"text":"Here it comes: my shortest review, ever!

Wanted lunch on a mid-afternoon visit with my wife. The music was so loud that we concluded that we could have no conversation, no dining experience. We left. 

Don't know about the food... couldn't get past the \"noise.\" 

Never again."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this restaurant but I was disappointed with my visit. The menus and floor were pretty old and dirty looking. The restrooms were a mess. I ordered the veggie burger and it was just bad. It had no flavor except for the cabbage and onion and just tasted like a mushy egg roll. The server asked me why I didn't eat my dinner and I told him, yet I did not speak to a manager or get anything off my bill. The sweet potato fries were good if they weren't cold, and I got basically half the portion of my friend who got the same fries. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food. Pulled pork sandwich was nice and tender. Daughter had fish and chips, she loved. Will was our waiter. Fantastic waiter. Place was awesome."}
{"text":"We went here on a game morning. 
4 stars because I don't think this was indicative of a normal visit. 

We had food and drinks. 
Drinks were all in disposable plastic. Not the greatest but I understand because of the timing. 

Nacho tots were great. We had a mix of breakfast and lunch. Pizza was good. Tacos were good. 

We were not rushed out even with a crowd outside. Lots of tvs for games. Just a really nice game day atmosphere."}
{"text":"Me and boyfriend came here after watching some of the pirates game. The people at the front desk were super friendly. We were seated quickly. The food I had was the bbq pulled pork sandwich and it was really delicious. I also had sweet potato fries with caramel dipping sauce which our server Shelly recommended us to try. It was a great combination. She was very kind and personable. It made the overall experience awesome. Next time I'm in the Pittsburgh area I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"The pitas that come with the spinach dip are not so wonderful. We took the dip to go and bought our own chips. The wings were good, though they did forget to give us blue cheese :( sliders....meh. Not great, but not terrible. Usually I'm pleased with this place but I was somewhat dissapointed with my experience last night."}
{"text":"Really spot on service. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. My girlfriend had some allergy concerns, and when we told our waiter, he alerted another employee (maitre d'?), who promptly brought a checklist of allergen-friendly menu options. They also have a section of the kitchen allocated specifically for allergen-free foods, which is amazing.

On the food: good on-tap beer options, 36 burger and the tater tots were great.

Classier environment than your typical sports bar with an obscene amount of televisions."}
{"text":"We've gone to Jerome Bettis Grille a bunch of times. We love sitting outside. The location is perfect. The food is however just so so, and the service is really slow. That's sad. Hope they can heed all of these reviews and improve, cuz they would totally rock it."}
{"text":"Good food great views friendly staff and fast service. Had the fried pretzels and firecracker shrimp. Tried the I C light it was good"}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Bathrooms are neat. They have a two way window so you look on the bar as you go. They don't complain if you pop in just to use the facilities (like if you're hanging at stage ae."}
{"text":"We came to the cute area not planning on eating here. The menu was very mediocre and read \"boring bar food.\" But, we were sooo pleasantly surprised!!"}
{"text":"Had the assumption that a \"celebrity/sports star\" kind of place would be overpriced, crappy food, marginal service, you get the point. All UNTRUE here. I was very impressed. Happy hour at the bar (with a few seats open just prior to a Pirates home game), cordial servers, and a ton of different food offerings (from the healthy choice to the fried grilled cheese...). We had snacks at the bar (mini perogies and the pizza), and both were fantastic. That and 2 drinks each, and the bill was 24 bucks. May be high for Pittsburgh, but for those of us visiting from other areas, it was a steal. Extra bonus (so I'm told)- men's room has a 2-way mirror on top of the urinals that looks into the restaurant ...certainly interesting."}
{"text":"Listen: Where is the DEEP FRIED HOAGIE?!?! We loved this! Bring it back, don't get cheap with a paltry cheeseburger :("}
{"text":"Great place to pre game a Steelers  or Bucs game, or in my case a Volbeat concert at Stage AE. I can't get too in depth on things here since I had chicken strips while sitting at the bar.

It was packed for a Thursday happy hour, good, kinda loud music playing. Not too loud though. Decent selection of beer on draft and plenty of seating, probably not enough before a Steelers game though.

I gave it 4 stars because the beer was cold and the service was quick. And the chicken was pretty good. Will be back sometime to actually hang out and eat a meal."}
{"text":"The food here was great. Thge staff very attentive 5 STARS, no 20"}
{"text":"If you need a place to eat late night on a Sunday before you lose all your money at the casino, I can't highly recommend Jeromes....but it's open and you will get food."}
{"text":"The weather wasn't great the night we visited,  which meant we had our choice of seating.  The staff actually looked amazed that someone had braved the snow to come get a bite to eat.  The host was pleasant. He later also became our server.  The only bizarre part was that he sat us next to the only other table of people in the restaurant.  Their party had about 12 people and it just would've been nice to have a bit more space and less volume.  But we got past that by admiring the variety of memorabilia on the walls.  If you are a football fan of any sorts,  it's definitely interesting to see the pictures,  jerseys,  trophies and more. I ordered a burger.  It was prepared just as i requested and quite tasty.  We did order one of their specialty cocktails also and enjoyed it too.  I'd love to come back during football season. I imagine this would be a great place to watch the game."}
{"text":"Went on the night of Beyonce concert and it was packed to capacity, but yet still we received our food in a timely manner (compared to how busy it was), and our server kept his composure. The food was better than the average sports bar, so I would go back."}
{"text":"I was incredibly disappointed with the service that I received in the afternoon Sunday, July 27.  I made reservations via an online app, and they were relatively prompt sitting us.  A slight annoyance was that they never removed my name from their list so the app kept texting me that my table was ready.  I had to go back to the hostess to change this.  Next, I was a bit annoyed that it took our server too long to greet us.  Yes they were \"busy\" but in my section there were a lot of empty tables.  My boyfriend and I order immediately when he greets us.  It's ~3 PM  We decide to be simple to get in and out (or so we thought).  I ordered the sliders and fries with a Blue Moon; my boyfriend ordered a turkey burger and a side of fries.  My beer came 5 minutes later (which is fine).  20 minutes come around and I ask the waiter to check on the food.  My fear is another table getting my food (sliders and burgers are common).  It's going on 3:30 PM.  I'm beginning to get restless and not to mention hungry.  The server then brings on the excuses.  \"We just got a large influx of people so we're a bit swamped\".  He tells me the manager will bring the food out...  10 minutes later (yep, a total of 45 minutes after we ordered) the manager (Kristopher Brown) comes out with the food.  All that he did was apologize and give me the same excuse that they're just busy.  Other people that came in before us were in and out.  He offered NOTHING to us. No discount, no complimentary anything.  We felt like we didn't matter at all and that management didn't care about us.  After that I didn't have the time to even argue.  I guess I know where I stand.

I was greatly disappointed in the service and ESPECIALLY Management."}
{"text":"The only word to describe this situation is HORRIFYING. I'm going to start this with clarifying statements.

1. I know how busy restaurants get on Saturdays. 
2. I understand it was exactly the time for that late dinner/drinks crowd.
3. The North Shore gets crazy when there is a Pitt game, even away games.
4. I have worked in restaurants before. 

THE WAIT:
That all being said, we expected a longer wait for a table. What we didn't expect though, was to be told that they \"in no way could even give you an estimate on how long this will take.\"  We had a party of 5 people, not a large group at all. After standing outside in the beautiful weather drinking beers, we soon realized that we'd been waiting for nearly 2 hours.

Eventually this lovely hostess, Christine, approached us (they call your cell phone when a table becomes available) and asked us how long we'd been there. We told her and she immediately got us a table. She was truly a great employee. 

THE FOOD:
Finally seated, it was another 5-10 minutes before a waiter came over. His name was Bobby and he was clearly young and new to serving. He was running circles around the tables. He obviously had a full section. 

2 in our party ordered wings as an appetizer and those actually came out really quickly. They smelled great and I don't think either of them had any qualms with the taste either. This is where took a quick and crazy downturn. We asked the waiter for napkins and refills on beers, we didn't see him again for 10-15min. I actually had to flag down a bus boy/food runner for napkins/silverware. The waiter stopped back and we reminded him about the drinks we needed, which by this point had gone from 2 to 4 beers. We placed our order and 1 in our party ordered the 36 steak. In case you're not familiar with this it's a 56$ 36oz steak. This is a serious piece of meat. He ordered it medium well, and the waiter did let us know that this may delay the food coming as this steak is thick. The rest of us ordered various burgers. By this point I'm starting to get hangry (an anger driven by extreme hunger). 

I made certain to stop and tell 2 manager/supervisory types how great Christine was doing and she had even stopped back to check on us just to make sure things were ok! 

THE HORROR:
We have been at this place for 3 hours now. Waiting for food for a little over 1.5 hours. The general manager stops over to our table with some of the absolute WORST customer service skills I've ever encountered. He did apologize, but it went like this... \"We really don't know when you food will be out. Our kitchen is sort of down right now. It's coming eventually, bro.\" The member of our party who ordered the 36 actually asked him to just forget the steak and get us 5 burgers to go so we could go back to our boat. He also mentioned that if the meal was free we would leave with our burgers to go, make sure to really take care of the server, and leave as happy as possible. 

The manager's exact words... \"I don't care if the server gets taken care of, I just want the customers to be happy.\" I was so offended. As I mentioned, I've worked in the food industry as did someone else in our party. That's just too much. 

The food came out about 5 minutes after that, including the steak. The steak was so bad that my friend couldn't eat it. It was cold and dry it almost made me choke. This was Denny's/Eat N Park grade steak, not 56$ steak. My boyfriend and our friend had the deep fried burger, I tasted that and it was delicious too.  

Here is where I snapped though... I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I am shaky at this point as I've been on a boat in the sun and haven't eaten anything. I put the top of the bun on my burger and grab a steak knife as I almost always have to cut a burger in half. 

I saw the burger in half, drooling as meat juices (I also like it medium rare.) and bbq sauce is squishing out. I pick up half of the burger and notice in the very low lighting something far brighter pink than the meat right in the middle of my burger. A PIECE OF PINK PLASTIC IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BURGER. I knew immediately what it was, it was the medium rare indicator that they are supposed to stick in the top of the burger. It was laying flat IN THE MIDDLE OF MY MEAT. 

I shot up out of my seat and took it right back inside and forced the manager to take it from me. I reminded him that this food can't get any more free than it is right now, and I don't have another 3 and a half hours to wait for food. He tried to tell me that it couldn't have been inside it. To which I picked up the other half and pulled the cut in half indicator out of the center. I didn't even get to eat dinner after 4 hours of waiting.

Never ever ever again. I left starving and angry."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to check out if you are on the Northside.  Reasonably priced and good sports bar feel."}
{"text":"We went on a beautiful day, but had a poor lunch.  Championship Nachos were covered with a oily cheese and flavors were off on approaching stale corn chips.  Draft beer was barely cold, flat and you could tell the lines needed cleaned.  
The bathrooms were just a dirty mess.  This is mid-afternoon?  No excuse for unclean rest rooms."}
{"text":"the bus!!! i love how you can piss and watch what everyone is doing at the bar. haha food is good and drinks are reasonable"}
{"text":"Aw, a mostly average place for such an above-average player!

Came to this establishment earlier this month for an appropriate occasion...to watch The Bus get inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, of course!  Made plans to get together with a couple close friends who were visiting town, catch up, grab food and a few drinks, and watch the highlights of the induction ceremony.  That's exactly what we did and all-in-all ended up spending about 8 hours here.  Time flew by because we were having fun, though the fun was mostly due to the company we were with and not so much to the setting we were in.

I expected the service to be decent but not extraordinary.  It was.

I expected prices to be a little on the high side to account for the prime North Shore location a few steps from Heinz Field.  They were.

I expected the food to be slightly above average at best.  That was the case.

What I didn't expect was for the crowd to be thin until the afternoon Pirates game let out.  Getting there several hours before the ceremony began turned out to be completely unnecessary.  Also didn't expect the food portions to be on just the slightly generous side being that we'd heard from several people that portions here are Bettis-sized.  Husband and I shared a steak salad (half yummy pieces, half chewy pieces) and burger (overcooked) and fries (tasty).

As for drinks, after learning the mimosas came with an inexplicable price tag of $8.25 a piece--when I ordered the server told me she believed the mimosas were \"about $5.50 each\"--I opted not to enjoy more than one of those guys.  I also had a couple tasty but weak specialty martinis.

Atmosphere became more fun and lively as the crowd grew in size.  Probably a good option for game day if you want to drink indoors whilst being as close to Heinz Field as possible without actually being in the stadium.

It's rare that I review a restaurant/bar after just one or a couple experiences, but I'm making an exception in this case because, honestly, I don't plan to come back here for quite a while, if ever.  Hopefully Hines' new restaurant in the northern suburbs is a little better."}
{"text":"My Dad only turns 70 once. I asked him what he wanted for his birthday, and he said a night at the Pirates game with all of his kids. So that's what he got. 

Since the Parents don't know the city that well. They asked for suggestions on where to eat near the park. We decided on Grille 36. 

It was CRAZY busy when we got there, but they quickly got us a table for five. We sat down and our waiter was there in a jiffy. He didn't tell us his name, unfortunately. But he was amazing. We quickly had our drinks, and refills. 

I had been previously to Grille 36, and recommended the Fried Cheeseburger. So, everyone but dad got that. Haha! It was still as good as I remembered. Dad got fish and chips, and he shared them with his favorite daughter..me. I'm a lucky girl. He really enjoyed it and ate the whole plate! 

Right before we were to get the check, the waiter came over and asked if we were going to the Pirates game, and we said, \"yeah, for dads birthday!\" And ten minutes later, he came back out with a giant plate of brownies, ice cream and a little skewer on top, lit like a birthday candle. He sang a horrible rendition of Happy Birthday, but we didn't care. You could tell that it's something they don't usually do, but this guy went above and beyond to make sure my dads meal was special. So, thanks, nameless waiter. 

I hope I can take my dad back someday. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"If this place wasn't on the North Shore by the stadiums I don't think that it would stay in business. The food is habitually below average and the service is extremely slow. I only go here if I'm meeting up with someone who is using it at a starting point."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their outdoor patio after a concert the Friday of Memorial Day weekend with my wife.  Ordered the Deep Fried Cheesburger and had a coronary the next day.  Seriously, though, it was good, just a bit rich with all the fryer oil."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The energy in here - especially on game day - is amazing! It's always busy, but we've managed to sit in the bar area and usually just end up eating there too. On game days, they have giveaways for Q&A's etc...nice touch! a guy also gets on the mic periodically to pump up the crowd...very cool. We always get the chicken nachos for an app - HUGE and delicious. My favorite entree is the mac and cheese - oh my gosh SO GOOD. Corkscrew pasta with a delicious cheese blend, tomatoes, scallions, bacon, breadcrumbs = heaven. My husband gets burgers and likes them, and one friend got the huge steak and it looked like somthting off the flintstones. We've always had really good service and leave happy. There is always a beer special and the food prices are good too - which is a true testament to the place and to jerome, because given the location and everything he could definitely charge SO MUCH more, but he loves us pittsburgh fans!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. The nachos are huge and the pretzels with cheese dip is great. Sandwiches are okay. Just normal. The tv situation and surround sounds are what you come for. Drink prices are not too crazy for the location."}
{"text":"Great service great location great cocktails 
   We were enjoying a warm afternoon on the north shore one Sunday and stopped for lunch. The drink menu might have more items on it than the food menu. I tried one called something like \"watermelon wave\". It was refreshing and not overly sweet...perfect!
   I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich for lunch and it was well seasoned...flavorful and delicious. The fries were pretty darn good too.
  Although we arrived at the restaurant during an unexpected rush, we sat outside and didn't mind the wait. We could see the fountain at the Point and a newlywed couple and their bridal party were taking photos in the nearby park so we just sat back and enjoyed a beautiful day in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner at a gameless night. I had a steak burger and my friend had a turkey burger. The service was good, and the person serving us was very quick to attend to our needs. My burger wasn't very good. The meat was kinda dry and it was very though to chew and it didn't have a lot of flavor. My friends turkey sandwich was good. 

The bathrooms are very weird. They have very little light inside. 

Overall it's got a good atmosphere and its a pleasant place, and we had a good time. Too bad the food wasn't the best, but we'll be going back for another try some other time."}
{"text":"A few of us from North Carolina recently took a trip out to Pittsburgh for an NFL game and had an awesome experience at Bettis Grill.  We decided to pregame at Bettis Grill and it was a decision we would not regret.  The atmosphere was electric and the food was very good.  The nacho plate was enormous and did not skimp on any ingredients.  The best dish I had here was the Ultimate Mac and Cheese.  That dish was one of best mac and cheese dishes I have ever tasted. If you visit this place then it is a must order.  The prices were reasonable and the service was good considering it was game day the place was packed.  We also ordered multiple rounds of the liter shots which were strong, cheap, and good!  I would definitely visit this place again if I'm ever in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"OK if your a Steelers or Pirates this place is a perfect location for a pre or post game drink or food. Although I only had a salad, so I don't want to say their bread & Butter stuff MEAT, is not better then the salad. It was just ok, had way too much dressing, forgot to order on the side as I usually do, but someone fell asleep when pouring!! The atmosphere was cool, but the service was just ok again. Not sure if I will be back on my business travels, but may give another try, when I am not looking for a salad."}
{"text":"Ate here while traveling for business.  I had the tropical shrimp salad which was fresh and flavorful.  The only glitch was the service which was comprised of college students fumbling around apologetically \"Sorry, I'm new...\""}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced as well. The main point I want to get across in this review is that you MUST visit simply to use the men's restroom. There is one-way glass on the urinal wall. This means that you can see out....but no one can see you. That big mirror you see when you walk in...that is one-way glass my friends. I know it sounds crazy to post a review about this - but of all the restaurants I have visited, this is a first. It is certainly something to remember!"}
{"text":"Went to the Bettis Grill today with the family. 

We actually started at the foundry.  we weren't too impressed with the menu, so we finished our drinks, and left. Should have stayed. 

I Hate to say this because I love the Bus, but it was by far the worst service I've had in over ten years. Waiter never brought us all of our drinks. In fact, after he took our order, he never came back. He literally passed our table no less than 12 times without stopping or coming near us. 

The poor people from the back brought our drinks and food. They looked swamped while the servers and hosts hung out.

We finished our food, which was obviously sitting under a warmer for a decent period of time, and waited 15 minutes before stopping someone else to please have our waiter bring us a check. The wait staff was obviously more concerned about hanging out than doing their job. It was horrendous. It's a shame as I had such high hopes. 

I feel if Mr Bettis knew what was going on, he'd flip the entire floor staff."}
{"text":"Soon to be famous deep fried cheese burger--OMG!!! Need I say more? Of course there are other items available on the menu.  It's always crowded on game days so I would recommend going on a non-game day if you want better service."}
{"text":"I've gone a few times for lunch during work and things have turned out much nicer. Prices are still the same, but the service was much better."}
{"text":"We went here before a concert at Stage AE and for once we didn't have to wait. We usually go somewhere else, because it's always an hour or more wait. 

We aren't Steelers fans, in fact we both had on New England Patriots clothes. The staff was very nice and told us it was a great Super Bowl and everyone has their own team. Very nice, because it's true, doesn't matter where you live, you can like any team.

We ordered our food, got burgers and the food came out in a timely manner and everything was very good. Our server was good too.

The servers walked around and cleaned up the floor in our area all night and kept the dinning area very clean.

My only complaint, I went to the bathroom before we left for the concert, it looked like a tornado happened in there! Toilet paper everywhere, half the stalls didn't have toilet paper, or the new rolls where sitting on the dirty bathroom floor! The trash can was overflowing and paper towels were all over the floor. It was just a VERY dirty bathroom. There are enough hostess outside of the bathroom, standing at the desk, that someone could check the bathroom. I was a hostess before and I checked the bathrooms on busy nights every hour!"}
{"text":"Good location between PNC Park and Heinz field. Solid tap list as well. Food wise, I went with the shrimp tacos and they were pedestrian. If I go back, I'll probably go with something safer like a burger."}
{"text":"YUMMY in my tummy. This food is some good eats really, but if you're a foodie (ie food snob) don't bother. It's bar type food. It is awesome,hearty, flavorful, and surly fattening the portions are Jerome Bettis approved. I love their souped up bar food...the pretzels are a thing to be devoured Our service has been top notch twice, And We were even invited into the \"owners box\" last time. It was amazing."}
{"text":"While in town I stopped here to eat some dinner and watch a game on one of their many tv's. 
The game I specifically wanted to watch wasn't showing but the staff was able to quickly accommodate my request.
I enjoyed an order of dry dusted wings, some tater tot nacho's and a few Lite beers from Miller. All good and as expected. The service was good, lots of games to watch and overall a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Deep fried pretzels! That was the first thing we noticed after we were seated on the appetizer menu. We went to Jerome Bettis on Friday night for our weekend stay in Pittsburgh. Given the fact that there was a baseball game that night and this is a sports bar, it wasn't that busy and we were seated right away. 
Our waitress was attentive and got our drink orders and our appetizer order right away. The pretzels were served with honey mustard and our waitress also suggested we get the queso to dip also. So good! 
When it came time to order our entrees, I went with the shrimp tacos and my boyfriend ordered the BBQ Bacon burger. I was slightly underwhelmed with my tacos. They were good but not fantastic. I tried Shane's burger and fries and they were great! It was a nice, low key dinner which was exactly what we were looking for after driving all day on Friday."}
{"text":"This place is owned by \"The Bus\" from my favorite team THE STEELERS and he is from Michigan where I currently live so know I had to check it out.  Enjoyed this place. It is right off of the waterfront in downtown Pittsburgh. It has TV's in every location of the restaurant and has outdoor sighting with a good view of the riverfront. The food was ok but if you are a sports fan it  is definitely the place to be. Parking is across the street and convenient."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were just awful. The food here is mediocre at best, especially for the price. The first time the service was decent but the Mac n cheese and the wings were completely underwhelming. Yesterday, the service was horrendous and the food was absolutely disgusting. We had the loaded nachos with chicken and guacamole and everything about it was just bad. Cheap, cold dollar store chips, chili that tasted like cheap $1 a can, mystery-meat hot dog chili, the \"pulled chicken\" was ice cold, had zero seasoning or taste and had a texture as if it had been sitting in a pan of water for hours on end. There was almost no cheese on them and the guacamole was obviously pre-packaged crap as well. To top it off, the nachos EVENTUALLY came to our table sitting in a pool consisting of what I guessed was undrained lettuce water and chicken \"juice\" and we're soggy. The Romaine for the Cesar salad wasn't drained so there was also a pool of Caesar flavored water at the bottom of the bowl. Service was beyond terrible and everyone around us was complaining. The couple next to us eventually got up and left. I spent years in the food service industry as a server so I am very forgiving of bad service, rarely complain and have never stiffed a sever even for bad service, but I did today. Manager comped our entire meal including drinks so that was cool, but still not worth the headache. I'd rather pay for good service and food than have what we had for free. Sorry, Jerome. I love ya but your place is not worthy of your name."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to places on the North Shore. The portion sizes are huge, like what would be appropriate for The Bus himself. I recommend mortal humans share one entree and one appetizer. Unless you get the tot-choes. Those can easily feed a family (of Mormon Fundamentalists)."}
{"text":"We had lunch here after a tour of Heinz field. It was the perfect stop for us. It was a 5-10 minute walk from the stadium.
We got there around 1pm so it was not crowded. We were seated immediately. 
The food is typical grill food. We had burgers and a buffalo chicken sandwich. Both were good and served quickly. 
There is a lot of interesting memorabilia of Jerome and signatures of people who have eaten there. 
Plus there were lots of tvs if you wanted to go and watch a sporting  event.
It also has  outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We love Jerome so I was so glad when this restaurant turned out to be so good!  The Black Bean Burger and Salmon, Rice and Veggies were legendary. Everyone else ordered Burgers so I couldn't get much feedback.   All anyone would tell me was, \"It was great!\"  Long live \"The Bus!\"

Oh, they aren't kidding when they tell you the Carrot Cake is big enough for two, 2 Pittsburgh Steelers!  It was big enough for our entire table of 7!  And Maggie was a great waitress. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't GO!!!!!!!!! 2-3 hour wait to get in and 3-5 wait to get your food!!! Extremely disappointed, this restaurant is only in business because of its name. It would be shut down if it was any other restaurant.  The kitchen can't keep up with the amount of orders that come through. A 'll of the employees will tell you, \"This is the worst we have seen the restaurant in years.\" The managers need to be fired immediately.  All they do is apologize for the terrible service and go back to flirting with the waitresses. (Jerome or someone from corporate,  I hope you read this!!) YOUR RESTAURANT NEEDS RESCUED!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The waitress was very familiar with the items on the menu and knew the specials off by heart. The menu didn't have that many items on it so I went with a Chicken Caesar Salad (which it was only $1 extra for the chicken, so that was nice) the chicken was excellent all white meat and grilled nicely. The Caesar dressing seemed too watered down and made the salad sloppy. Prices were very reasonable for 2 people and a child. (23$)"}
{"text":"The food is subpar and the wait staff doesn't seem to know how to do their job properly. Our waitress didn't even know the daily specials off the top of her head, spent more time tending to a table of her friends while we went with empty drinks. I got fish and chips and could not taste the fish at all, because it was very bland. Also, when we were about to leave we asked for boxes for our meals and were provided a folded box instead of styrofoam boxes. The folded box would have leaked juices from my husbands Mac and cheese all over the place, so we left half our meals without the ability to take them home. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this week.  

The bugers we had were very good.  I had the Bettis 36 burger and it ranks right up there as one of the best burgers in the burgh.

There are not many healthy options and don't even think low calorie when you go here.  Just go and have fun.

The fried pretzels ARE kick ass.  Get both the chesse and the honey mustard."}
{"text":"Definitely a disappointment. Service was slow which wasn't a big deal because we weren't in a rush but burger came out cold and the cheese wasn't melted in the least. Sweet tots were ok but looked like anything you could pick up in the freezer section of your local grocery store. Beer seemed a tad old and flat. Server was very good, which was nice. Thought the bathroom was cool idea but the place was kind of dirty overall. Lots of dirt and trash in the floor that just didn't give a good impression. This place probably does a huge business due to games and concerts but there's really no reason to go out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow especially because it wasn't especially packed. The beer selection isn't bad but it's nothing to really brag about.

As far as food goes, I had the boneless wings and a salad. Honestly the house salad was much better than the wings. The wings had a hard texture to them making me a bit nervous at why. 

Overall not a bad place to go before a concert at Stage AE but don't be a rush and don't expect too much."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. The sriracha mayo is a nice compliment to the black and bleu burger 

Service was good, and the place was not very busy for a Tuesday lunch around 12:30pm. 

Great menu selection from burgers to a dozen appetizer options and desserts."}
{"text":"Nice place, great service. Dry, over cooked hamburger in spite of ordering it medium rare. The other burger ordered at our table was described as dry and tasteless.  Disappointing especially considering the price.  Tacos looked great.  Not a destination restaurant but looked like a nice place to catch a game over a beer."}
{"text":"Tourist trap and I was caught. Interior looks like a generic red robin just not as clean. I wouldn't say it was busy when we got here but it wasn't empty. The service was absolutely terrible. My fianc√© and I sat at the bar thinking the service would be quick so we can get in and get out. Unfortunately the management here is terrible. Our server/bartender did a fantastic job and she is not to blame. On a Friday in mid summer she should have had more help. From looking around it seemed everybody was frustrated because of the lack of service. The manager was behind the bar for a few minutes not helping tho. Not sure what he was doing but he wasn't helping with orders or drinks.  Service was a lot better when relief showed up. Not sure why there would only be one bartender working on a Friday. The food was great. I had a 36 burger cooked medium rare and to my surprise it came out medium rare. Most places struggle with that for some reason. My fianc√© had ordered the margarita flat bread pizza in which she said was very good but not out standing. She's kinda picky so very good is about an 8 out of 10. Not gonna lie the fries sucked. Beer selection was on point food for the most part was awesome and our server was doing a great job for being alone. I tried this place because when in Pittsburg for the first time you kinda have to. Won't be back and I can't really recommend it. Nothing was outstanding and had the place been staffed better we probably woulda stayed longer."}
{"text":"This place has a great location next to Hines Field. I came in hungry and still hungover from the night before and they help fix both issues.  We had bloody marys that hit the spot and I had short rib tacos that were pretty good.  My wife a club sandwich  that was very good. They sell Bettis Items and have TVs everywhere.  Get there early on game day because it will get packed."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaraunt twice. Never had to wait for a table. The first time was a great experience. The server was polite and funny, attentive but not so much so you were annoyed. My fiance got the steak salad, I got a blue cheese burger. My fiance LOVES these steak salads! Price was reasonable, maybe a little expensive for food quality. 

The second time we went we ordered an appetizer. We got nachos. Now, I know as a server you like to add on appetizers to increase your tital. But the size of these nachos was enough to feed 6 people! I believe that the waitress should have said something to us! 

Aside from that, I will return to the Jerome Bettis grille, it was delicious."}
{"text":"This two star is based on overall appearance, ONLY. Grille36 managers please take heed and don't get angry, just go it. I like the appearance of the place, but there are way too many bugs and the bar area stinks.... BaaaaaaaaaaDuh! The floor around the bar was extremely sticky on my visit. The bar towels that were being used were gross, leaving the bar itself sticky and stale smelling. My advice: let's get these bar tenders to be more consciousess about cleaning better. I mean HELL.... Not just 5 minutes ago.... One of em dropped a beer glass as he was filling it, and automatically slung his hands back.... AT ME..... Along with beer. Thanks. Lets clean up your act."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Great location next to the stadium. Asked 4 different employees on the pricing on the souvenirs and for 4 different answers.  Overall, the food was good, but the bathrooms were a mess and we were there for probably 4 hours, and no one attended them the entire time.  How do l know???? The same stalls never had toilet paper in them.  Garbage cans overflowing with paper towels, and floors on the bathroom were disgusting."}
{"text":"Phenomenol service! Out server Will went above and beyond! He gave us a great tour of the place and told us some great facts. I had the fish and chips, it was amazing. The fish was flaky like it should be and the chips were the best I have had in my 35 years on this planet. Definitely a must see when in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This is always a must stop for us when we visit Pittsburgh. The servers are fantastic and they were always happy. My husband and I were visiting and having a very good time, having dance parties in the bar area. The food is also great. Their homemade guacamole is amazing."}
{"text":"In the area for a conference and went to this place twice.  It's a good sports bar with lots of TVs, lots of room, and great bartenders. It's right next to the Steeler stadium, so the crowd seems to be mostly hotel guests from the surrounding blocks or bar regulars. The menu is pretty vast, but my burger was great. Most of the sandwich options my colleagues ordered were well received. 

I made the mistake of ordering some shrimp/cheese wonton as an appetizer and that really missed the mark. But it seems like this place will have a beer, cocktail, and dish for everyone."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I found this place while visiting. Everyone that worked there was so friendly and the bartender was amazing! They made me feel very welcome."}
{"text":"The best sports bar/ restaurant in terms of fun/ customer service on the Heinz field part of the stadium area!  Excellent bar food and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned this \"upscale sports bar\" has a great location, especially when there is a game or a show nearby later. I love sitting in the bar because of all the windows and how nice and airy it makes the place seem.

However, contrary to what Bettis Grille may want to believe, this is really just a slightly nicer than average sports bar. The food's not bad. It's not great, but I've had much worse. It sits somewhere in-between. I've never had bad service, but I have only ever say at the bar and thus can't comment on the servers. 

The beer selection is decent, but watch out for those cocktails and shots. A mimosa one Sunday cost me almost $9. Ouch.

If you're sitting at the bar, the TV setup is really wacky. I don't know, I just think they could have done better with that. Then again, considering this is a big sports town, I'm a little disappointed at the TV setups in most of Pittsburgh's sports bars.

All in all I haven't mind any of the times I've visited, though this place is nowhere the top of my list. It's just kind of there."}
{"text":"I will never return. I'm sitting at this restaurant as I type. Arguably there is a one direction concert this evening BUT we were sat at 12:52 (thank goodness for cellphone time stamps) and a server didn't come for over 10'minutes. When he finally arrived we ordered right away and waiting until 1:56 to get our food which was then wrong, cold, and over cooked. We asked the server for an approximate time and he dilly dallied the whole way. Awful on all counts"}
{"text":"This place is supposed to be \"the best.\" It is not. I would place it in line with a chain family restaurant. 

Between my party, we ordered a Mac & Cheese dish, a turkey burger, wings, fried fish, and a salad. 

Portion-wise and aesthetically, it was OK. Not super fancy, but not crappy either. The problem arose when we all realized the cook had apparantly never heard of salt, or any other seasoning for that matter. It was all bland, bland, bland. The salad was the most flavorful thing!

There isn't much you can do to screw up a fish filet, which was what I ordered, and I was OK with what I received for the price. I just expected a lot more from a super great place like this. The fourth star was for our amazing server- she was a heck of a gal, and if the food matched, I'd be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful bar, super close to pnc park. Was excited to visit after a pirates game...BUT, do not expect good service. I sat at the bar for 15 minutes without getting acknowledged. Went next door and had immediate service. Stay clear of here"}
{"text":"A must stop if you like classic grill food and are a Pittsburgh Steelers fan. Located right between PNC Park and Heinz Field the location is great and the food is better. We went on a warm summer afternoon before a Pirates game to get a quick bite and of course wanted to try out Jerome Bettis place since we were in Pittsburgh and he is a classic Steeler. We sat on the patio where we had an amazing view of Point State Park, Downtown Pittsburgh and the river. My boyfriend and ordered a local beer off the menu, which the server had great knowledge about. It was served in an adequately sized glass and perfectly fulfilling for him before a sporting event. We placed our orders, getting an appetizer and two main dishes. He had the signature burger, burger 36, which was probably one of the better burgers we have had in a while. The sauce was amazing and topped everything off, we also got the Ultimate mac and cheese which was great with the bacon crumbled over the top. I got the pulled pork which was alright but I preferred his burger. We didn't go inside so I can't speak about the seating there or the bar experience but can say we certainly enjoyed ourselves on the patio even on a somewhat windy Pittsburgh afternoon."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my recent outing. Although it is far from my first visit....I felt I could now give a well deserved review. 

The atmosphere is unique....You can do a private setting, or sit by the ample bar seating. I personally like the bar seating area. The noise level is typical of a sports bar but also creates a dining experience presence.

The food is amazing! Very generous portion sizes, a festive sports centered variety. Awesome cocktails.,..and the Bus Steak Salad is an award winner (IMO) but feel free to find out for yourself! 

The wait time for seating can be tricky and on busy days quite lengthy...personally it's the only reason I gave 4 versus 5 stars. Otherwise it's an awesome place to be during a Steelers game! 

Try it! The Bus does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Jason Hondros is the most amazing general manager I've encountered. He was very knowledgeable and accommodating to my group from out of town. He went above and beyond to make our visit enjoyable. Now let's talk food, we had the chef's special Cajun shrimp pasta and it was delicious, so creamy filled with juicy shrimp! It was simply amazing and I will absolutely be back to visit next time I'm in Pittsburgh. The decor, the service, the location is perfect! This is a great place! Jerome Bettis should be proud to have his name on this place!"}
{"text":"I am in no way saying I like the Steelers by coming here. I'm not saying I'm gonna start cheering for them. But Jerome Bettis' restaurant is amazing! When I came in with my Brother and friend they staff thought we played professional football. They took us to a private room and when we went in I was in shock. It was ex players having a meeting and they were speaking about football related topics. My first thought was to take a picture but I froze. Once they figured out we were not players they escorted us out. We walked to the bar and one waiter noticed my disappointment for not getting a picture. At the bar I noticed this place was beautiful, it was modern and full of TV's. I loved the atmosphere and everything about the place. We joked with the Bartender and she was pretty cool. We ordered food but my friend asked us not to order any burgers because we always do and that was fine so we got a variety of items and shared. Later on before the food came the waiter walked up to me and told me a player went into the bathroom. Me being me I waited and he came out. It was Mike Logan and he walked up to me. He thought he knew me and I didn't want to correct him. I told him I was a Giants fan and that I respected him and I asked for a picture. He agreed and my night was made. After we sat back down and it was time to eat. The food was good! The shrimp was perfect, the mac & cheese was good, the buffalo sandwich was amazing and the chicken burrito was perfect. I truly enjoyed this place. I hate to say it but I wish there was one in New York. I'm gonna ask my friend to move in just to be close to this place."}
{"text":"Great place to eat all-American food and pregame before the Steelers game.  The staff are nice and the lines at the main bar aren't too long. Love the outdoor vendors and seating area."}
{"text":"4 stars for food, 4 stars for our waitress, 2 stars for the kitchen. Let's just say it took well over an hour for our food to arrive, Not sure what happened back in the kitchen, but the wait was totally unacceptable. We did end up getting a sunstantial discount on our meal for the inconvenience, and luckily for us we were not in a crunch for time. Parking was a crapshoot as there is street parking, but unfortunately for us We had to choose a lot for event parking which set us back  $12. We had no wait time for a table which was nice considering there was a baseball game that evening as well, that also contributed to the no parking situation. Our waitress was attentive and the hosts/hostesses were very friendly. The food was surprisingly good. Normally these restaurants that people slap their name on are notoriously not the best for good food, but we thought it was good eats. I went with the Bus Salad. Definitely not a salad for dieters , but definitely a hit in the flavor department. Mixed greens, steak tips, cheese crumbles, corn, tomatoes, onion strings, tater tots, and melted cheese. Very tasty! My husband went with the deep fried cheeseburger, because who can resist a burger that has been deep fried?? No-one! He thought perhaps it would be overdone since it was fried, but it came out juicy and tender. Definitely a must try item on the menu. They did offer a uniform discount which was appreciated."}
{"text":"We ate here before the pirate game. The service by George was awesome. The food was good and the drinks were too"}
{"text":"Don't come here for the food.  Come here because, like me, you are visiting from out of town to attend a Steeler's game and you like being surrounded by the excitement!  The boneless wing appetizer was no different than what you buy frozen in the grocery store.  The Australian Grouper sandwich was not delicious but the sweet potato fries that came with it were.  The vegetarian burger was incredibly dry and bland.  The carrot cake was as HUGE as my husband's HEAD with lovely cream cheese icing (not taking off points for the embarrassment I felt when it was delivered to my table).  The service was very good - our waitress was terrific.  She responded well to all of our concerns.  Great service  made up for mediocre food.  I wasn't expecting much, I am kind of a food snob,  but I knew what I was getting myself into when I came here.    Very very loud, they do not take reservations, kid's are okay, casual, full bar, very crowded on game day, special events menu on game day (not the full menu you see on the website).  Come for drinks.  GO Steelers!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and I am glad I visited!  It is attractive, modern, spacious, and comfortable.  The only downside was that my wife and I were seated at a table with no light.  My bacon barbeque burger was delicious, fairly priced at $10 including a nice helping of tasty french fries.  My wife made a hearty meal of two side dishes: macaroni and cheese ($5), and mixed vegetables ($3).  The scrumptious macaroni and cheese side dish was what some restaurants would no doubt offer as a full portion.  Her glass of house wine was fine, but for $6.50, it was not a bargain.  Attentive and friendly service from Brian made the meal most enjoyable. We liked that the restaurant was still serving after the Pittsburgh Pirates game, our arrival being after 10:30 p. m. We shall return!"}
{"text":"The service was incredibly slow. We had a table of 5 and it took roughly 3 hours from sitting down to leaving the restaurant. It took so long for a few out drinks they took them off of our bill. The same thing happened with our dessert. The food is always good so I can't complain about that.."}
{"text":"Went here before a concert at stage AE on Friday. The hostess acted as if we were putting her out, and getting waited on was difficult. Had to ask for a drink menu, was served a sloppy beer with no napkin and shorted on change. Even an appearance by The Bus himself wouldn't have changed this for the better. Disappointing to say the least, wont be back. Someone needs to keep an eye on the outdoor waitresses. Bar Rescue comes to mind."}
{"text":"Try the pomegranate martini, it's awesome! 
Their signature dish is the deep fried burger but I didn't like it that much."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  I wish I knew the bartenders name she tried her best to get things done. Wait time for a party of 1 (me) was 1 1/2 hours.  A seat at the bar opened up so I only waited an hour. After sitting I order lunch and got it an 1hr. 40min later. Came in from CA to watch a Steeler game and wanted to give this place a shot. Overall wait time, I walked in at 12pm walked out around 3pm. Also I still had to pay full price. Fist time last time."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to during the summer time. I love sitting out on the patio which has a pretty nice view of the riverfront. The fish and chips were delicious, the fries were sweetie potato and had this cinnamon sugar on them which was amazing! I only really go once a year since the price is a little high and I rarely go on the north side."}
{"text":"Came here after our Heinz Field tour. The restaurant was very busy when we got there but we were seated right away. Our waitress was Toi and she absolutely wonderful. Very attentive, gave us her suggestions about the menu, and just hands down the friendliest best waitstaff experience we've had compared to other places. The appetizers came out quickly and shortly after we finished with them, the entrees came out. Everyone's food was fresh, hot and DELICIOUS! Would 100% go back here again! Great experience!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a great sports bar and convenient to Heinz and PNCs stadiums. The menu was very big though.  Food was OK nothing to brag about.  Most things were fried or greesy in terms of menu items.  I had a burger which was pretty good.  The fries weren't that great.  I'd go back if I was in area but nothing I would make plans for."}
{"text":"What an experience! 

We didn't have very high expectations because of a few negative reviews but we were pleasantly surprised! 

Large portions, great \"bar food\", cool indoor atmosphere, and an AWESOME outdoor seating area right on the riverwalk! Only reason I don't give 5 stars is it is a tad overpriced. But not a deal-breaker by any means.

Oh...and make sure you try the \"Purple Rain\" cocktail if you like sweet drinks."}
{"text":"I was here over the summer (the day the duck floated in to town!) and had a nice experience that was tempered with so-so food.

The Firecracker Popcorn Shrimp appetizer our table shared was amazing.  It was tangy and spicy and on a bed of cabbage and carrots, like a slaw but barely dressed.  I was debating between fish tacos and the deep fried cheeseburger (I mean, it's a deep fried burger, I HAD to try it) and I wish I had gone with the tacos.  Someone else at the table had them and they said they were delicious.

The burger was on its way, but I thought it could have used some tweaking.  The patty was dry and tough and the beer batter was fried to a rock-solid state, so it was hard to even cut through the thing.  Cheese was on the patty before it was battered, so it basically melted away to nothing in the fryer.  It was topped with lettuce and tomato.  Nothing amazing.  The menu says it has \"secret sauce\" but I didn't detect much of it.  I'd want something zingy to cut through the grease, like a coleslaw; something that makes everything pop and come together.  I ended up eating it with the garnish from the shrimp appetizer.  The fries were pretty good; not amazing but not just average either.  I'm not going to lie, if I'm debating between dishes and one comes with fries (or housemade chips) I'm going with that one.

The server was attentive, though you can tell very busy; even then, he checked on us frequently and didn't show signs of being rushed or frustrated with the crowd; hats off to that!  The beer list was sadly not updated; most of the seasonal pumpkin beers had just hit and were already gone, so that kinda sucked.  I know it's hard to keep up on a Friday, though.  I'm not sure if this is a regular occurrence, so perhaps your experience with the beer will be different.

Overall, it was average.
Pros: shrimp appetizer, accommodating waitstaff
Cons: deep fried cheeseburger, beer not well stocked"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short (sorry Jerome):

Fried Pretzels are okay: I'd take a Auntie Anne's pretzel over this. The honey mustard was the best part.

I ordered my Burger 36 Medium and my girlfriend ordered hers Medium Well; both burgers came out Well Done.

Sweet Potato Tots: they were alright nothing special I've had them before...in my grocers freezer section.

P.S. Yelp say's the restaurant has a private lot.....they do not! Don't make the mistake of leaving a paid lot to move your car to the non-existent restaurant lot just to have to pay for parking...again.

OMG.....How did I forget to mention the two way mirror in the men's room. Maybe I'm breaking some carnal Man rule I'm not aware of but: Be warned ladies....the mirror behind the host/hostess stand is actually a two way mirror....behind it is the men's urinals?!?!? So guys peeing have a clear view of the bar and people walking in.....its kinda cool but on the flip side very disturbing and creepy."}
{"text":"The saving grace of this place is its location.  The seating area outside has a great view of the city/rivers.  But...service was horrible.  The food was sub par.  They do have a good beer variety.  I'm sure this place does well during game time, but it's a typical sports bar."}
{"text":"What this place has going for it is it's location-right across the street from Heinz Field.  Other than that, I would be hard pressed to go out of my way to eat here.  Every single person at my table had the same opinion of the food: it was nothing special.  I had the Burger 36, and with its blend of sirloin, short rib meat and bacon it sounded pretty good.  But it was less flavorful that I expected. 

Our waitress was exceptional, but I did notice other tables not getting as good service as we did.  Looking at the other Yelp reviews, I would think fair to middling service was the norm, and our good service was not the norm.

One particular aspect of the restaurant might entice someone to downgrade or upgrade the restaurant rating by one star:  the men's room.  Behind the hostess table is a mirror.  When you enter the very dark men's room right behind it you realize the mirror is actually a one-way mirror over the men's urinals.  One member of our party was weirded out by the fact he was peeing while looking out at people entering the restaurant.  One other member of our party liked that he could pee and watch the football game mounted at the entrance.  To each his own, but I was ambivalent and used the stall."}
{"text":"the food was excellent and the selections were interesting... A wide variety of American food with s twist!!  I ordered a simple steak salad but it was by no means simple, it was extravagantly tasty!  this is a great place to go if your in town and enjoy  great food and watch a game!!"}
{"text":"Aha Tuna and Bacon Cheeseburger were excellent. Sweet potato fries had a sweet flavor? They were the bomb! yum! The atmosphere was lively and fun with the noise level of a typical Sports bar. They had two large Christmas parties going and we still had excellent service. Drinks were kept full. We will definitely go back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Great place, great location. Parking is tough, just like most area's in the city.  walking distance to both Football and Baseball Stadiums.  Decent food, ok prices.  DEEP FRIED CHEESEBURGER.... Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I ordered wings and they were not extra crispy like I asked and had hardly any sauce on them. the chicken tasted like it had been frozen and microwaved and then deep-fried. Very very bad. I got to say the pretzels were pretty good but the queso was not. And everything was super slow coming out of the kitchen for a restaurant that was ridiculously empty"}
{"text":"Long overdue but want to give a shout out to George, our server, who went above and beyond with our service when we were in town visiting in March. We had only planned on grabbing a drink and appetizer and ended up staying for dinner.  He was so friendly and helpful, giving particular attention to my son's food allergies. Thanks for making our night great!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great but the food is average. It's your typical sports bar except everything is overpriced due to the name on the door. I've now been here twice on two separate trips to Pitt and this time I got the deep fried cheeseburger since it looked interesting. Do yourself a favor and don't get it. Last time I got the nachos and it was enough to feed a small army. I would stick to the specials on the menu but don't get the deep fried cheeseburger!!! Definitely worth a try on a game day."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner for a bachelor party before going out. The food was average, nothing extraordinary. We ordered tatchos as an appetizer and they were the best part of the meal. I ordered the black and bleu burger and ordered it medium; it came out extra well done and was very dry. 

I ordered a bourbon smash and it came out in a tiny plastic cup. When I got it, the cup was only 3/4 of the way full and there was a ton of ice. What really was disappointing was they charged me $14 for a sub par drink!!

The service was very slow. It took over an hour for our appetizers to come out (tatchos, quesadilla, and a buffalo chicken flatbread). We were at the restaurant for over 2.5 hours because it took another 50 minutes for our meals to come out after our appetizers. Very disappointing.

I probably wouldn't return in the future, but if I did, I would try either the artery clogging fried cheeseburger or fried Italian hoagie."}
{"text":"We are from California and decided to go here for dinner and to watch some football. We had such a great time and we enjoyed the food that we went back the next day before and after the Steelers game. We loved this place and the staff were super nice and friendly!!! I highly recommend this place!! Plus it's right by the stadium. Try the Mac & cheese!!"}
{"text":"JBG 36 purports to have been voted Pittsburgh's favorite sports bar/restaurant for as long as they've been on the scene. 

Really?

Kay's gonna mercilessly skewer this place if and when she gets around to writing a review, and based on the morsel I had of her Moroccan Pomegranate BBQ Chicken entree, it would be hard for me to argue with her. She claimed it tasted \"processed.\" To me it was just dry and tough. 

We both, however, cherished the Gehenna out of the Deep Fried Pretzels. An order gets you a quartet of swarthy kosher-salted staffs  that are essentially the most sinful breadsticks ever kneaded, twisted, and baked. A downright delightful cup of bright yellow honey mustard sauce sat in the middle of the tissue paper bed.

JBG 36 has one vast menu with a great deal of items that are tremendously appetizing reads. 

And I ordered a burger, yet again. 

I know. I do that when faced with myriad choices, don't I?. 

Jerome's Fresh Ground 100% All Beef Half Pound Burger is its name, killing your hunger pangs is its game. 

And it was sufficiently charred, juicy, and fresh. The pile of fries that sat to the side were crispy and rich.

There's no way in hell this was 1/2 a pound of beef, though. If that were the case, considering that I was fairly full from a late-morning meal at home, I wouldn't have finished it so easily, if at all. 

Our desserts, the Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate (Kay's) and the Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse Bar (mine), were both frozen duds. My after-dinner treat was just plain unwieldy. Judging from the icy plate, I reckon these (you actually get several to an order) sat in a cryogenic state awhile. The mousse part of the bar was fine, but the bottom Nestle Crunchesque part nearly broke my tooth. 

Ya just don't freeze candy bars. It should be a federal crime. The \"coconut peanut drizzle\" tasted like sweetened glue with turpentine folded into it. 

Don't fret! JBG 36 does have a few things in its favor. 

1-It is unswervingly across the road from Stage AE, making it a convenient choice for dinner prior to the Anthrax/Testament/Death Angel gig we caught tonight. 

2-Morgan, our excellent server, was such a darling and fun young lass that I feel lousy writing such a middling review. She told us that her boyfriend \"puts whipped cream on everything.\" He is a fortunate fellow. 

3-As I said earlier, the menu is large, so there's much to try. 

Would I come back? If it's between this and the Hooters-Meets-Piper's Pub joke that is The Tilted Kilt,  then make mine Jerome's.

P.S. The men's restroom is the strangest one I've ever been in. It's dark, cavernous, there are windows that allow you to see out into the bar without being seen, and the sink is...illuminated? No, I was not on LSD."}
{"text":"1 hora de espera pero vale la pena, la cerveza muy buena, la comida tambi√©n, l√°stima que que muy satisfecho para seguir tomando."}
{"text":"Stopped in after being at Stage AE for the Sumo Showdown.  Bar area was pretty full when we arrived but we managed to get a table that was just being cleaned.  
Our waitress was terrible!  
We ordered drinks and one app. and stated that we would be ordering more apps. once we had our drinks.  The drinks took a little bit and our waitress disappeared before we could order more apps.  Then she did stop by and looked at us and said, Oh Yea you ordered an app.  She ran and picked up our app. and started to run away! Ha!  We were able to get her attention and did order more apps.   During all of this a few more people showed up at our table and not service. Those apps. did show up pretty soon and then she did refill some drinks and take the other drink orders.  By this time the bar area was about half full. Then no waitress, no cleaning up of all the plates and apps that were on our table, no drink refills.  We put all of the dirty plates on a table nearby.  Those were picked up and finally we were asked if we wanted drink refills.  Then we asked for the check.  She forgot that and we had to ask again about 20 minutes later.
We shared a few apps and a steak salad.  The steak salad was good, the Chips & Queso was OK, you do get a fair amount of Queso and Salsa but not enough chips.  The flatbread and quesadilla were also OK."}
{"text":"Garlic wings gave us indigestion all night!  Other food was average, nothing special for the price."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! Came in from Nashville for a wedding and was told the Hall of Famer would change my life...it did! Bones, our server, aka Chris Feathers, was an awesome guy! He gave us crack in a cup and was just an all around good guy. You knew he loved his job. Thank you Chris!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The sweet potato tater tots are amazing! There is also an edamame appetizer that they offer with a really good sauce if you are looking to have a protein filled vegetable appetizer! I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, which was good. The quesadilla is especially good and totally worth a try! The interior of the place is nice- dimly lit with many TVs and tables. Every time I went here, I experienced no wait and there weren't many people there, which made it a calm and relaxed environment. Just note that in the winter, they don't take care of the surrounding side walks, so be careful walking! My friend and I were slipping and sliding everywhere from the science center to the front door of the restaurant!! Other than that, I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some unique eats for a good price!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and everytime is equally as great as my last visit. It is by stage AE and sits alongside the river so it's a great place to go for a date or to eat before a concert."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly service. Except kinda preoccupied due to a college football game going on while we were eating. Agree with those who said to get the pretzels. Very yummy. Our server suggested caramel dipping sauce. Everyone at the table agreed it was better than their honey mustard. Get that if you can! I had the turkey club sandwich and the hubby had the skirt steak. Both were prepared well and we got to see Jerome Bettis' brother. Hah. Too funny. GO steelers!"}
{"text":"Been here several times before more recently went with my boyfriend because it was his first time going. We ordered an appetizer I believe it was shrimp I don't have a picture but it was really good it came on a bed of lettuce which was great. I have pictures of what we ordered the service was good the food was much tastier this time than it has ever been before in the past. I would say the menu was not extraordinary but for what it is it's okay"}
{"text":"I love catching games here when I visit Pittsburgh. It's a high end sports bar with a ton of nice televisions and a separate dining room, as well. The menu has both bar fare as well as slightly fancier options. My favorite element is the one way mirror behind the hostesses that you can see straight out of from the men's room, so you can still see most of the TV's while at the urinals. Well thought out!  Good job, Bus!"}
{"text":"Before reading this review please know I'm not a local, my family is from Pittsburgh and we've been wanting to try Grille 36 for awhile. These reviews made me laugh though. Cmon...when you walk into this place you should know exactly what you're getting yourself into. Throw healthy out the window-drink a beer, eat some nachos and watch some sports. Enough said. 

I get giddy every time I visit Pittsburgh. My family drove from DC to Detroit to see the Bus in the Superbowl. Sitting on a bar stool at Grille 36 just flat out made me happy. I don't even remember if the food was good actually. Or if it was loud, or if the service was good for that matter. I remember meeting nice people,  there were sports on everywhere, I was with my family, and it was a blast."}
{"text":"Toi. 
Toi is the best. She's the hostess with the everything! 
She's awesome and helped make our first trip to Pittsburgh a treat. She set up my wife like royalty for her birthday. 
The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is fun and the prices are great for huge portions. 

You gotta come here... And ask for Toi!"}
{"text":"Went in tonight with my family for the first time since we're visiting from Albuquerque, New Mexico and my dad is a diehard Steeler fan! We all ordered the Steeler's Steak and they all came out perfect! Our server Mike, was attentive and kept our drinks full! One of the managers (Jason) came up to the table after we'd finished and was SO amazing! He gave us a list of places to go while we're here, told us a little about the history and even took us into the Owner's Box so we could see Jerome's hangout and the shoes that he wore while playing! It was great and we will definitely be back on Sunday before the game while ESPN is there! Hopefully lucky enough to meet/see Jerome!"}
{"text":"Sad to report that this was a total bust. We used the no wait app as suggested by their website. We got there a little early, checked in, and went to the bar to order a drink. We asked for a drink menu and after deciding what we wanted stood there for about 10 minutes without speaking to a bartender (and they were no that busy). Deciding that we didn't really want drinks in a small plastic cup decided to wait and order from our table. Stood there a bit, tables were available, and others were being seated. The hostess forgot about us. 

We were finally seated and sat at our table for 15 minutes, never spoke to a server, no water, nothing. We walked out.  

Disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a real sucker for a feel good story and Jerome \"The Bus\" Bettis is all of that and more.  So, what fan of the 5 time Super Bowl Champion Steeler's doesn't wanna eat at Jerome's restaurant?

Located in the Del Monte building near Heinz Field, the outside patio has an awesome view of the Pittsburgh City skyline.  On a hot Saturday afternoon, we opted for inside.  We were here for a late lunch, so we didn't get really adventurous.  My friend had a highly recommended Fried Italian Hoagie.  It was stuffed with salami, pepperoni, cappacola, provolone and hot peppers, battered and then \"yes\" deep fried.  It was crazy good!  My simpler tastes went for the Apple and Blue Cheese Salad with sherry bacon vinaigrette and candied walnuts.  Needless to say, I helped my friend polish off his hoagie and we took most of my salad home!  They also have the very best raspberry iced tea ever!

Service was great.  We had a team of servers attending to our needs, not just one.  They seemed to be working as a mob, even though the place was busy.

My friend commented that the men's room had a two way mirror, I could live without knowing about that.  

4 star restaurant, get's another star for being Jerome's.  I said I'm a sucker.  No, I'm a fan.  I love it!"}
{"text":"The view from the men's room was unique.  Since it is, I wonder if anyone else has picked it up?  (Probably some place in Tennessee).  
We hit it right before a Pirates game, sat outside, and put up with slow service.  The food and drinks were good enough, although hamburgers came with and without specific fixings.  
I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, but might have to use the men's room."}
{"text":"Went in here for a late lunch on Friday, June 15. There was a game that night and there were some people there but it was not crowded. Our waitress brought us water and disappeared for over 20 minutes. She then came back, took our orders and left. it was another 30 minutes before we had any food and no waitresses in sight. I had the blackened Mahi Mahi tacos and they were not good. The shredded \"lettuce\" was some very old limp green pieces that I picked out and the fish was over seasoned and dry. I ate it because I was very hungry but otherwise wouldn't have. While we were eating a waiter came over and tried to serve us a beer, which we didn't order.
Don't bother stopping in here."}
{"text":"We arrived around 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon. We were told it would be 30 minutes for a table so we sat at the bar to have a drink. Bartender was very welcoming. He immediately acknowledged us and had menus in hand. My wife ordered a cocktail (a mule of some sort). She loved it, and she is very particular about her cocktails. I went with a Guinness cause you can't go wrong with that. Within ten minutes, I received a text notifying us our table was ready. We were seated outside on the patio with a wonderful view of The Point. Our table was in the sun and we were hot so we were about to ask if we could move to another table with shade. The manager could tell we were in need of assistance and came over to introduce himself (Eugene). What a gentleman! He escorted us to the other table and proceeded to take our order himself. He explained that they had an unexpected surge and so staffing levels weren't what would be ideal. Well we couldn't tell. Eugene  made us feel like VIPS. He tended to every detail of our visit. Eugene did what a lot of managers don't do in a tight situation - he rolled up his sleeves and helped his staff. Now to the meal. I ordered the deep fried cheeseburger which was deep fried deliciousness. I had a second Guinness as well and my wife ordered a second cocktail which she enjoyed as much as the first. We had a top notch experience and we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great service, great food... Loved the Jerome burger, perfectly cooked. Waitress was upbeat and got everything just right. This was the perfect spot to eat in between stadium tours."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for the Stadium Series weekend and went here late after the game at Heinz field. Our wives were able to get table before game ended otherwise we would have been screwed. Place was packed and more and more fans kept coming. 
We had some apps and drinks. Food was good and service was fine."}
{"text":"Was just ok. The 36 burger was not all that. We waited for a while for our food. Wife's crispy chicken was pretty good. All in all just ok"}
{"text":"I hosted a military reunion for 36 people recently, and needed a place close to our hotel for a buffet loncheon.  The planning process was very easy, and the price very reasonable.  When we arrived the food was brought out immediately.  We had the tailgate buffet, and I heard good cooments about the sliders and especially the buffalo chicken.  The waitstaff was knowledgeable and attentive.  I would recommend the Bettis Grill to anyone."}
{"text":"Perfection - From entrance to exit!  We sat outside and the view of the Mr. Rodgers statue, the Point's fountain, and the river were all spectacular.  The drinks (Creamsicle Martinis) were delightfully awesome.  The very reasonably priced food was unique, plentiful, and delicious.  Worth noting - the service - was impeccable!  Our waiter was named Rahim and he was great.  Moreover two managers needlessly checked in with us.  It was a delightful afternoon, spent with epic friends in a historic location.  Of note, it is literally situated between Pittsburgh's Steeler Football and Pirates Baseball stadiums."}
{"text":"Meh describes it perfectly.  Dry rub wings were pretty good but other than that everything was mediocre at best.  Service was slow considering it was less than 1/2 full.  They weren't rude but they weren't overly pleasant either.  Probably better to just go to the bar pre-game."}
{"text":"Was seated promptly excellent service. Absolutely no complaints. It was perfect weather which made an absolutely beautiful night and now A  really slow walk back to out room"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after walking around Heinz field. For some reason I was craving a burger, so I ordered the Bbq Bacon burger even though the Deep Fried Cheeseburger intrigued me (it's dipped in a beer batter, how could that be so bad?) I also upgraded my fries to Sweet Potato fries. I was ravenous and even though the burger was huge I ate the whole thing! And the fries were dusted with cinnamon so the smell was like having Christmas on a plate. We split a piece of Key Lime pie which was creamy and perfectly tart, but soo big we couldn't finish it. Service was wonderful, our server was on top of it and knew just when we needed something. I would come again, when in the area of course."}
{"text":"Atypical sports bar, big drinks, big portions of unhealthy food and a lot of flat screen televisions. Oh, big bill at the end of your meal too. 

Most popular item on the menu seems to be the deep fried Italian hoagies, deep fried cheeseburgers and meatball sandwich. No, the don't deep fry the salads here, but even they aren't typically healthy due to the fact they use about a hall cup of dressing per dinner salad, and according to Pittsburgh rules, about a half pound of fries depending on your salad. The 36 oz steak is huge and looks like it would be hard to finish along with the sides and salad that comes with that meal. 

Daily drink specials and happy hour priced apps. Busy during events at PNC Park and Heinz Field, and after work with all the offices on the North Shore."}
{"text":"Jerome Bettis bar and grill. I love this place my wife and I are huge Pittsburgh Steeler fans and we go here every time we're in Pittsburgh. We try to go to Pittsburgh at least once a year to catch a Steelers game. It is a lot harder now since I have two children and and to get a babysitter to watch the girls for the weekend while we drive up to Pittsburgh, but when we do get it we always make sure to go to Jerome Bettis bar and grill on a Saturday night before the big game on Sunday afternoon. The atmosphere of this place is a 5 out of 5 it is absolutely stunning inside the Sports Bar & Grill. The coolest thing that I see about this place is the bathrooms. When you go into the bathroom it is a two-way mirror where you can see out into the bar while you're in the bathroom using the urinal. It took me a while to get used to it at first and then now it's humorous and kind of neat and in the urinal they have the biggest Rivals of the Steelers so the men can urinate on the Bengals the Browns and the Ravens which is funny. This is a bar food type environment but they do have some classy type food as well such as Italian and ribs and whatnot but always go with the classic big Bettis Burger which is about $10 and then it is a phenomenal Burger great place great prices of the food and they always have the games on. We like going on Saturday nights because there's usually a Pittsburgh Penguin game on and we watch that in the crowd and they listen to it and everybody's excited and pumped up for the Penguins. I highly recommend this place we will be back the next time we're in Pittsburgh which will hopefully be this fall and I hope everybody goes out and tries it."}
{"text":"First of all I'm a STEELER FAN but when it comes to food that's a different story.

The buffalo spicy wings were ok, quite dry. The side of fries had just a hand full on a large plate and the 12oz rib eye steak had no favor when I added salt the shakers were wet so there was no salt that came out.

The bathroom had no toilet paper in 4 stalls and there were no napkins.

1 star for personable customer service and another star because it's a STEELER restaurant."}
{"text":"Outside of the location there is no reason to come here. I ordered mini sliders which were hideous, burnt so bad they looked and felt like hockey pucks. My wife had chicken which was overcooked and my sister had shrimp which was absolutely disgusting. Also it was a busy Saturday and our waitress was overwhelmed and proceeded to tell us how overwhelmed she was 10 times. One good thing that happened to us was that we were told the wait for a table was an hour and a half and literally five minutes later we got a text that our table was ready. Entire staff seemed completely overwhelmed"}
{"text":"We went to the Bettis Grille 36 on our honeymoon, and it was insanely good. I(bride) got the mac and cheese and it was honestly the best i've ever had. It had bacon in it! My husband got the 36 oz steak and it was cooked perfectly, and cut like butter. The best part of our experience was our server, Matt. He was so friendly and was great conversation. He even scored us a desert on the house for our honemoon (chocolate chocolate cake-heaven!) The whole staff there was awesome, and we can't wait to go back next year."}
{"text":"So I was at a yoga class with my close personal friend, Snooki, from TV's \"Jersey Shore\".  

While doing a Warrior One pose, she whispers to me \"You know, it's really fun to take a leak in public\".  Knowing how conservative and middle-aged I am, I figured she was just trying to get me to blush so I told her to zip it.  Of course if she could do  that, she wouldn't be pregnant now!

Fast forward to lunch on a sunny Saturday at Jerome Bettis' Grille 36....I visit the men's room and lo and behold, they've got this one way mirror in front of the urinals so you're facing the bar while taking a leak!  You can see people right outside but they can't see you (at least I hope not).   That was a very freaky experience, but I can see where Snooki was coming from...it was kind of cool.

Now, onto the food.

My friend and I sat on the patio. It was sunny and we weren't under a tree so it got pretty hot with no shade.   We started with the soft pretzel sticks.  They were great!  Then my friend had the mac and cheese and I had the meat lover's flat bread.  He liked his food and mine was tasty, although if the flatbread had been crispier, it would have been nearly perfect.

Our server was like a Pittsburgh version of Matthew McConaughey.  He was laid back to the point of being in a coma and I could barely understand a word that he mumbled.  But he was nice, our drinks were never empty and he got us our food, so there you go.

The decor is really nice and everyone there was friendly.  I don't think it's fine dining, but for solid food and nice service, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere :) great food, cool friendly staff.. the barn yard burger was great, and the blacked fish sandwich was amazing.. and the birthday brownies were amazing:)"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the games! Will, the bartender is so nice and best customer service! We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"It was good consistent food. The atmosphere was fun after the winning game for the Steelers. Plus with the option to add to the waitlist, that made it a plus. We took home a slice of the carrot cake and it was HUGE! Great to share with a family of four (don't do it alone!)."}
{"text":"The first thing that comes to mind when I think of the Jerome Bettis Grille is Carrot Cake! A delicious, amazing big as your head Carrot Cake! And, if it's your birthday, it's FREE! I found this out by default, but now every time me and my friends have a birthday we head there for the free Carrot Cake. 

Carrot Cake aside, I've never had a bad meal there. The menu has a large variety of American food. The most famous item on there has to be the fried burgers and sandwiches. Which means exactly how it sounds. It's a sandwich or Burger dipped in the deep fryer and served straight to you. Not for people on a diet! The environment is obviously set up like a sports bar with TV's everywhere, so it's a great place to come before or after a Steelers or Pirates game. They have large outdoor eating area that overlooks the city, so you can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Typical bar food atmosphere. Can't complain, it was free food. Really enjoyed the sporty atmosphere. And I love the location. Ate here my first time in in this town. Definitely a memorable visit, the food was ok but it's just a fun place to visit when you're in town."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was so so.. It was after a Pirate game so it was a little busy. I just had paid my bill and gotten my last drink when our transportation arrived... I asked the bartender for a 'to go' cup and she looked at me and said \"What's wrong with that one?\" So I said oh... Ok... And took my drink in the cup I had. They ended up charging my credit card an extra $10 for it. Which I don't quite understand. Anyways... If you go here make sure you don't take anything with you even if they say it's ok to."}
{"text":"I came here last night to watch the Pitt game and grab a bite to eat. It was pretty busy but we still managed to get seats at the bar and the service was pretty fast. They have a nice beer selection on tap, and I love that there is also a huge outdoor patio, although we probably don't have many good weather days left this year. I ordered the Mediterranean Hummus and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip. Both came with plenty of pita bread to go around. The hummus was pretty good - it was pretty much what you might expect to get ordering Mediterranean hummus. The spinach and artichoke dip had prosciutto in it, which I have never had before in this type of dip. It was delicious, but incredibly salty so I couldn't eat too much. I didn't order an entr√©e, although the gentleman next to me had the BBQ Bacon and Cheddar Burger and it looked/smelled amazing. My mouth was literally watering as I watched him eat it.

I will definitely be back to try the Mac and Cheese and the BBQ Burger, and will update my post then."}
{"text":"I will do my best to not let the Steelers loss taint my review of the bettis grille.  This is in my estimation the best sports themed bar in Pittsburgh.  I usually swing by this place when the Steelers are playing at home, but this is the perfect place to watch a game when the steelers are away.  For some reason I always struggle with where to watch the game when the steelers are away, McFaddens is fine, guiness and all that, but the food is awful, the same can be said for calico jack's.  South side is also kind of meh' for Steeler sunday.  Bettis Grille was crowded yesterday, but not overwhelming.  I was there with about 8 people and while we only had one seat at the bar none of us had to wait for any real amount of time for a drink.  The space itself is very nice.  It has a huge football shaped bar with at least a dozen 50' plasmas with every game on.  I would characterize the food as good bar food or close to upscale casual.  I've tried many things here on muttiple visits and never been really disappointed. Yesterday we tried the burgers, which were cooked pretty well on soft buns with decent seasoning and plenty of melted cheese.  The chicken quesadillas were also adequate and the popcorn shrimp was served in style in a chinese box with plenty of veggies and ranch dressing.  They weren't overbreaded and had a nice amount of spice.  There is plenty of parking for $3 and if it's nice enough you can park a few minutes away and make the walk without the cost.  The mens bathroom is somewhat odd.  I mean it's nice enough with marble and plenty of room, but the urinals are facing a one way window out into the bar and maybe it's just me, but I findi it a bit disconcerning to think of a bunch of guys staring at whatever lady friend I happen to be with while they are doing their business.  Maybe it's just me.  I think it's a little overpriced for the booze.  I drank mostly guiness at $5 a draught, seems a little high and had a glass of wine or two for around $10.  Some of the girls ordered lemondrops for $8 a shot, seems a bit pricey, but I tend not to do candy shots myself.  Overall this is a good place and I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Dropped in here when on a quick trip through town. 

Frankly, I was kinda bummed about the food.  90$ for six for lunch including a child and all of our dishes were mediocre at best. Soggy fries that no one finished, overlooked flavorless burgers and dry chicken sandwich.  Each person left less than satisfied. The burgers were clearly not fresh, they looked like the kind you get out of the freezer case. 

Service was a bit haphazard. Kept our drinks filled but didn't put condiments on the table, had to get them myself. 

Server was nice enough though. 

The location and atmosphere held promise and the outdoor seating is great.   Everything else is subpar."}
{"text":"First time I have been able to get in. I am usually in town when the Steelers play and this place is packed then. The decor is fantastic. Our server Yvonne was hilarious and so personable. If you decide to go here, ask for her. My girlfriend and I shared the street tacos (chicken) as an appetizer. The chicken was very moist and the whole thing has just the right amount of kick. I had the 36 burger and she had the blackened fish sandwich with a side of the Mac and cheese. My burger was very good and juicy. I liked the infused bacon. Her blackened fish was spicy. (We both like spicy food but it may be too much for some). The Mac and cheese was great. Their beer selection is good with many local breweries on tap."}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment probably 3 or 4 times over the course of 5 years. Out of those times I've ordered food only once and the other times I was just stopping in before a game to grab a beer. As far as the food goes it was awhile ago but I remember getting the deep fried Italian sub. I think mostly it actually being breaded and deep friend was about the coolest thing about it. Other than that it wasn't anything that great tasting. As far as stoping in here before a game and grabbing a beer I would AVOID this place. I usually only get drug in here because the people I'm with want to stop in and check it out. I know most places around this area especially at game time get busy but this place is not worth your time during a game day. I wouldn't even stop in just to look around as it gets so packed you can barely even move around in the place. The last time I stoped in 10/22/17 was the first time I actually got very rude service from the bartender. You could tell he was overwhelmed by the number of people ordering drinks but there is no reason to  be disrespect to paying customers with a bad attitude. Also if you don't like waiting for 20 plus minutes just to get you and your buddies a quick beer definitely don't try this place. The Tilted Kilt that is pretty much so next door is the place I would recommend 100 times over this place on a game day. They keep things rolling over there and there bartenders slay drink orders left and right. The only time I would give grille 36 another shot would be during a week day but I'll never be out there to try it for that seeing as I'm only in that area for Steeler games."}
{"text":"Very nice outdoor patio by the waterfront. Had the tortilla soup and it was good. The Margherita flatbread with 4 cheeses got my attention and it was really good. It was an appetizer but my instincts said it was going to be big enough, and it was. And then some:) Took a bit of time to get service but the nice waitress made up for it."}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality of sitting at the bar was Nick. He was attentive when our other bartender was not. He took care of her orders. The food was meh. Not a foodie's scene at all. So much potential gone to waste."}
{"text":"Do not even waste your time or money. Stopped in after a Pirates game this weekend and wish we would have went anywhere else. Got seated quickly but the wait time for food was horrendous. Took over an hour for the appetizer to come out. Then our waitress was barely around to question where our food was. Food arrived at the table which included 2 burgers and wings. WARNING: do NOT get the wings. Brother in law eats them frequently and loves them but they were so incredibly spicy it destroyed his stomach and he had issues for a few days afterwards. Spoke to the waitress about it and she said they often have many complaints that the wings are dangerously spicy and inedible. If the wings are that spicy and you have that many complaints, the management should do something about it and at least flag it on the menu!!! The salsa and quesadilla were also spicy but not nearly to the point of the wings. Also its disgusting and unsanitary to find out that when the brother in law went to use the bathroom due to the wings, he sees that the cook leaves the bathroom without washing his hands. Honestly this was a total waste and ruined the night. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite before event or concert! Menu has lots of options and the atmosphere is awesome for families or big parties. Service is as good as the rest of the place. Kevin, our server, anticipated our needs before we asked! Really enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Our first stop on our Pittsburgh Wing road trip, we love to stop at unique Wing stops and anything  to do with athletes.  We tried the Buffalo sauce and Asian sauce.  The Wings were good, they were not cooked consistently.  That means some were really crisp and some were not.  We really enjoyed both sauces, the Buffalo had a great consistent heat, and the Asian sauce tasted like I was eating sesame chicken.  They were both very good, and I really enjoyed seeing all \"The Bus\" memorabilia."}
{"text":"Crowded! This place was packed with people sitting and standing so much so that it's difficult to walk through. Our waitress was very nice but never brought one of our apps and kept disappearing for long periods of time. She was very enthusiastic when we asked how different dishes were before ordering which made me change my order. 
The food was good. Wings, good sauce. Nachos, huge. Deep fried burger, meh. Gorgonzola salad, yum. 
For some reason When we got our bill there were a couple things on it that we didn't order and had to have the waitress remove which took her 30 minutes to do. 
Definitely not a place for a quick bite but if you're there to watch a game the food is pretty good for bar food."}
{"text":"Certainly not returning to this establishment. We waited almost an hour and 10 minutes for the entire party's food to arrive - with a near empty restaurant. Service was poor and I can make better meals at home. We understand why it's not doing well as a restaurant in the North Shore."}
{"text":"went two years ago food and service was great .two years later the service sucked was brought cold food soup that was as cold as it was outside brocclii that was almost raw waited 35 mins. for the waitress to come back had to find a manager just to get my bill they have destroyed the name of the owner by the way the take care of the buissness and treat the coustomers.i won't recommend it again,maybe Jerome bettis should send in a mystery guest so he can see how bad it has gotten,then he might want to fix itso it will be up to his standards .what a waste of a birthday at least the steelers did not let me down.too pricey for the quality of food and service I received"}
