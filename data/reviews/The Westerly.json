{"text":"Located at the top of the restaurant strip on Roncesvalles, The Westerly is a cozy neighbourhood spot that is sure to please.  The uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'. Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.  We spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.  After a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon & smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.  When the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.  Between the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.  Amazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.  I would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).  If you haven't been, add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I live in the area but had not been yet.  I went with a party of 6 for brunch and it was delicious. Our kids had delicious lemon poppy seed waffles, I had a mixed grill hash skillet with chorizo, salsa, beautifully poached eggs and home fries. It was great. While the portions were not overly large, they were enough. The braised beef eggs benedict were served atop home baked cheese biscuits. Also good. The atmosphere and service is laid back and hipsterish, but not over the top.   We will be going back."}
{"text":"solid brunch place.   i had the creme brulee french toast.  solid.  basically a baked bread pudding rather than anything really like a creme brulee.  still it was solid.    nice casual decor and very friendly service is what really make this place worthwhile."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for the first time. For the appys we had brussel sprouts and scallops. Both were amazing but the brussel sprouts are definitely a must try. We ordered the cheesburger and the sable fish.  Both entrees were done very well and overall everything was tasteful. For dessert the creme brule was brilliant. This is kind of an unassuming place but is worth trying if you are around the area."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check this spot out for brunch. Totally impressed and would love to go back for lunch or dinner based on the caliber of the food. Great service, great food. Casual room and vibe. Recommendations: Monte Cristo and their americanos are fantastic. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family was visiting Toronto over the holidays and they are real foodies!. I love good food too but they are very hard to please. I was worried that I might not make the best choice when deciding where to take them .I had heard great things about The Westerly on Roncesvalles  so I made a reservation there. We were originally 6 people but grew to be 8 and they found us more room and made us feel very very welcome, the food was fabulous, even my picky sister thought it was great. The service was exceptional, from the host at the door(also very funny) to the fabulous Aussie server. We had such a great time and I highly recommend it as a place to go for a warm delicious evening."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my sister.  She has the spinach and brie scrambled eggs and I had the eggs with pork and beans.  The food was plentiful and quite good.  Would have rated it 4 stars but the service was slow and unfriendly.    It's seriously a hipster locale.  For that reason I would likely not come back."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great veggie options. Good wine selection and the latke appetizer is incredible."}
{"text":"The room at Westerly is cozy, warm (thank G-d, because I got stuck near the door), and buzzing. Both the bar and main dining room were at capacity throughout the night and the demographic in the room was vast and mixed. From well-dressed groups of couples in the above 40 category, to young pairs of girlfriends having a casual get together, it is clear that a classic yet diverse menu can ring in a large and diverse crowd.  My only criticism was that the room was just above my tolerable level of noise, and that's speaking as likely one of the youngest diners in the room! I suppose, the best solution to this problem would be to organize a large party and reserve the Westerly's 50-seat private dining room in the back, which seemed far less noisy when I peaked my head in at a group having dinner last night.  While at times the noise did make it difficult to hear our adorable server speak, it did not in any way deter her from delivering exceptional service. She was quick to replace cutlery, refill water glasses, chat with us in detail about menu items, and respond when certain menu items were subpar. The whole meal was timed and spaced appropriately, and we were in and out in a comfortable 1 1/2 hours.  The drink menu at Westerly is short but agreeable. The wine offerings are mainly international (with a few Ontario whites), while the cocktails are all relatively classic and identifiable. Over the night we sampled a Manhattan, a Caesar, their signature, the Westerly Spritz (Aperol, Cassis, Cava, Soda, Orange) and a couple decaf cappuccinos.   While the Manhattan was little watered down, the Caesar was fiery and bold, and despite the Spritz feeling refreshing and light, it could have used a spritz itself of something acidic.  We were both really impressed at the end of our meal with the perfectly smooth and frothy cappuccinos, joking that they might have been the highlight of the night.  And it was indeed a joke, as there were moments of perfection in the food, but perhaps just not enough for us to get really excited about. Over the course of the night, we opted to share:   Arancini with Bocconcini, Lobster Bisque and Mizuna ($14.00)  Not off to a great start. The arancini were were deliciously cheesy and crispy, but the accompanying bisque was problematic.  Not only were the lobster pieces incredibly overcooked, but the bisque itself was so oversalted, I wondered if a salt shaker had accidentally fallen into the pot.  I did mention this to our server, and she graciously comped our cappuccinos later in the evening.  Smoked Trout on Potato Latke with Dill Creme Fraiche and Frisee ($12.00)  This one fared a bit better, but the salt level was still a bit overwhelming. The latke was not traditionally shredded, but rather, was more like a fluffy, light fried mashed potato cake. It would have made a great dish all on its own without the thickly cut salty trout on top.  Duck Confit with Sour Cherry Jus, Grainy Mustard Mashed Potatoes, Fresh Vegetables ($25.00)  This was the better of the two mains. The duck was tender, and thankfully well seasoned, and the cherry jus had the perfect balance of sweet, tart and richness. The mashed potatoes were a little bit grainy and anemic, and I admit I could not detect any mustard notes, but the vegetables were just spot on. It always amazes me how many restaurants can't seem to cook basic vegetable garnishes and sides, but these were were beautifully tender crisp.  Braised Lamb Shank with Sweet Dried Figs, Sundried Olives, Toasted Pistachio, Tomato Jus, Israeli Cous Cous ($24.00)  Far less successful was the lamb. I have to wonder if the kitchen took my complaint about the arancini as an indicator I'm sensitive to salt. Actually, I'm probably more sensitive to UNDER seasoned food, which is exactly what this lamb suffered.  The braising technique no doubt contributed to the lamb's delicate and juicy consistency, but if I were evaluating just on flavour, I would have guessed the shank had simply been boiled in water. It just didn't taste like anything. While I at least got a nice flavour profile in the side dish, with the sweet figs, salty olives, and earthy pistachios, the couscous was overcooked and really just dissolved in the mote of tomato jus that flooded the basin of the plate.  Caramel Pudding with Salted Caramel Rice Crispy Cookie ($7.50)  Well, I often say that dessert can make or break a meal for me. And the Westerly is lucky I've got a sweet tooth because there were numerous menu options that appealed. In the end, however, with the help of our server, I was able to make my decision. Exactly as she described, the pudding was rich and thick with a slightly bitter burnt caramel flavour. Definitely not the cloying sweet butterscotch variety you get from the package, and absolutely delicious with the super salt..."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here. The food was superb and beautifully plated. Good wine choices. Excellent service."}
{"text":"We walked in Friday night at 5:30pm and there were 3 people in the entire restaurant. I stood at the front door and watched two young women talk to each other in the back hallway and never bother to walk up and speak to us. I walked to the back of the restaurant and explained that we did not have a reservation, but we would eat super quick if they could seat us. She stated, \"sure - how many?\" I said two and a baby and she instantly said \"no.\" She was cold, unapologetic, and just plain unfriendly.  We were expecting to be turned away b/c we didn't have a reservation, so she could have politely told us that they had no availability.  Does The Westerly not do children or is it just sub par customer service?  We have recently moved to Roncy from SF, CA and are huge foodies, but I cannot imagine giving this place another try."}
{"text":"Make sure to book reservations for Sunday brunch. Made the mistake of not doing this and the wait was long. Nice atmosphere and decor. Table for four, three ordered the frittatas and really enjoyed it, one person got the standard breakfast fare and found it mediocre. Sausage was gamey and left on the plate. Restaurant doesn't carry soy milk (we asked for soy for our coffees) and won't accommodate requests (won't scramble eggs. They're big on poached eggs over there). Decent experience but not expecting to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"We were a group of four and was thrilled to find a place that 1) came highly recommended, and 2) took reservations for weekend brunch.   The food was ok (although I felt the pan-fried potatoes weren't fried at all.. they felt stale, hard and lacking of taste), otherwise the eggs benedict was good.  What I was most shocked by was the slow service and lack of care to be efficient during a busy time. I showed up for our 10am reservation and ordered a cappuccino. At this point, the restaurant was probably about half full. When one friend showed up about 10 minutes later, the server came by to take her drink order and I asked about mine to which I got a very surly \"it's coming.\" response. The rest of our party joined us and it took a LONG time for the server to come back to take our food order. And a long time for our food to come. (I'd say over half an hour).  He also gave our other friend some attitude when she ordered her drink as well.   We were done eating, our plates were mostly empty if not entirely gone, cutlery off to the side and astonishingly nobody came by to clear our plates or see if there was anything else we wanted. Even with the packed crowd of waiting guests at the door. No lie (as I checked the time) we waited half an hour from when we were done eating, throughout the busy crowd, before the server finally came back to clear our plate. Still astonishingly, didn't offer to bring us anything else or the bill at that time. He grabbed our plates and left.. walking by us without making eye contact for 10 more minutes before I was able to catch his eye and ask for the bill.  We then saw him walking around bringing drinks, etc. to other tables before - once again - come over to our table ten minutes later to ask if there was anything else he could get for us. And we reminded him that we had asked for the bill.   It was about 45 minutes from when we were done eating to when we finally got our bills to pay and leave. I'm just shocked given how busy it was that there was no sense of urgency from anyone to be efficient and clear out a table that was clearly done eating."}
{"text":"Having recently read Amy Pataki's review of the Westerly, we decided to go there on a Saturday night. First of all they take reservations, which is fantastic and for this establishment probably a good suggestion. The wine is very reasonably priced and the staff is very friendly and attentive. Between the four of us, we had the mussels, French Onion soup (which is unbelievable) for the starting course. The braised short ribs and the pork and bean entree was really unbelievable. Dinner for four with wine and dessert was just north of $200 which I found to be very reasonable, especially since I never felt that I was rushed out of the restaurant. What a great place - highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times didn't disappoint.  From the friendly casual service to the tasty sweet and savoury options, The Westerly is definitely a brunch staple in Roncy.  First time I went I ordered the Creme Brulee French Toast and although this may sound like a toothache or a highway to diabetes, it actually is surprisingly not overly sweet but very satisfying. Definitely my pick for a sweet brunch choice.  Paired with the French press coffee this is a winning combination.  Second visit, I really wanted to have the potato latkes with smoke salmon, a friend of mine ordered this when I came the first time and it looked delicious.  I loved the latkes and with the smoke salmon another great combination.  They take reservations if you want to be there at 10am when they open.  With a group of 4 or more I would definitely recommend coming early.  Cool laid back modern/rustic decor, is a great space to hang out as well."}
{"text":"Tipped off by not one, but two people in the same week we ventured out to the Westerly on a busy Friday night after 9ish.  Upon arrival were advised we could expect a 40 minute wait we asked if we could leave our names and pop back in for either a table for two or a seat at the bar...to my surprise (the place was busy) they asked for my cellphone number and offered to give us a call when our spot was ready....and they called us!  Thank you Beth.  We returned, settled in at the bar and proceeded to enjoy a fantastic three course meal which was incredible.  Started with having to make the very difficult decision of what to have - the menu is wonderful and full of mouthwatering options.  Decided on smoked trout with potato latkes with dill cream, and mushroom ravioli (generous appetizer serving size).  Both were fabulous and promised a tasty entree to come.  The foccacia bread was light and fluffy, and perfectly seasoned and a second helping was offered without hesitation.  For a main we shared a braised short-rib that was probably the best I have ever had with the sweetest golden beets ever...mmmmm.  Dessert was a chocolate terrine that I will now officially crave.  The menu note which suggested to save room was spot on!  Thank you to the kitchen - our taste buds were very happy.  The place settings were charming simple white china, with mis-matched antique silverware - linen napkins...this is a place run by people with good taste on top of good manners.    The other thing about this place that we loved was that on our impromptu \"date night\", without reservations, we never felt rushed or pushed by the staff.  The timing between servings was perfect and allowed us to enjoy our very reasonably priced bottle(s) of wine without interruption.  A plus of this place that needs mentioning in case not specifically inferred - the staff - warm, welcoming, efficient, friendly, and quick with suggestions...marvelous.    The ambiance was a combination of romantic, but bustling with lots of different tables - groups,couples, friends etc. of all ages.  Very casual atmosphere.  We loved the decor, a modern french feel with attention to detail. Cozily lit, comfortable and substantial finishes.  A nice touch and very unique for other places on this strip, a main floor, large, private (his and hers) bathrooms with attention to details in fresh florals, quality hand soap, and a lint brush for touch-ups!  A very thoughtful place indeed.    Westerly - we will be back and you go on our top new restaurant recommendation list.  Well done and welcome to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"A small group of us went here this morning for breakfast (2 couples and a baby). My boyfriend and I arrived earlier and sat down and grabbed a couple of coffees. We thought the atmosphere was great and the menu looked excellent! There were 3 major issues we soon discovered. First, the server was not very friendly, but secondly, our food took over an hour, and our server did nothing to compensate us for the long wait, not even an apology! That being said, when our food finally arrived, it was delicious! The third and final issue I discovered as we were leaving.  We saw MOUSE traps under the booth that we were sitting at!! For me, and I think for many, this is a deal breaker and is unacceptable for any dinning area! Even if there is not a mouse issue, this is not something you like to see after finishing your meal. I can't say I'll be back here anytime soon, too bad, the food is really good!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed as my dinner guest had been before and thought it was very good. The lamb meatballs really could have been any ground meat, covered in a basic tomato sauce. The fish entrée - pan seared bass - was served on a bed of mushy polenta which was swimming in oil. Fish was very greasy and appeared to have been poached as opposed to pan seared. We had to repeatedly request more water and asked twice for sugar for my tea, then gave up and went to ask at the counter. Our server was pleasant enough, just not very efficient. I wouldn't return as there are so very many excellent restaurants in Toronto; why settle for mediocrity?"}
{"text":"The Westerly is fading and they need to come back fast because I used to really really love it there.  I love music in a restaurant but when I can't even hear the person in front of me I feel like what's the point.  I'm not a fan of the new menu - where's the chicken stuffed with pork, or the gnocchi in a mushroom sauce?  Also the lack of AC in the summer, especially during the recent heat wave, makes this place a bit of a stinker."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my partner and mother on a Saturday night. Had made a reservation although restaurant wasn't very busy. Service was pleasant and attentive. Ordered appetizers to share, entrees, and a bottle of California Pinot Noir for the table.   From the starter, we all noticed that the food was very salty. Any hint of flavour was hard to discern because of the overbearing salt. No luck on the wine either: it had clearly been kept at room temperature and was too warm to be enjoyable. This was a very unfortunate start and it didn't get better.  My main dish was the Fish of the Day, a pickerel with lentils, sweet potato and rapini. Again, the aioli sauce was way too salty and masked any flavours. Also, the fish was mostly undercooked. I was barely able to split it with my fork -- since when do you need a knife to cut through a piece of white fish?!  All in all a very subpar experience and not quite worth the near $300 bill including wine and tip. There is a major problem with Toronto restaurants trying too hard at being fancy and charging astronomical prices for mediocre execution."}
{"text":"We've been back to the Westerly twice since my last review - once for dinner and once for brunch.  The dinner was yet again, out of this world.  Everyone in our party of five loved their meal (including 3 orders of braised short ribs).  The atmosphere was cozy, the service was great, and it was a great, relaxed evening.  We were slow to leave at the end of the night, but were never rushed out at all.    Brunch was a hit too, although the service was a little slow.   My latte and hubby's cappuccino were both VERY nicely made.  We both thoroughly enjoyed them.  The creme brulee french toast was unique, but very dessert-y.... it left me feeling over-indulgent and lacking in protein, haha.   For those who are used to traditional french toast, note that this is more of a bread pudding consistency.  Delicious nonetheless.  Hubby loved the eggs benny.  Brunch atmosphere is bright, upbeat music, and yet still cozy.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This is a resto with a great atmosphere! The back room is great for hosting a private dinner for 20 people and I appreciated the fix menu options to simplify the meals for everyone. I had the stuffed chicken and it was delish but I could do with kwas cream sauce. Thw scallops were also well prepared.  I was not happy that the prices per glass of wine was a bit pricey for my confort.  Shelmt"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with lots of wood and dim-lighting.  I had the beet salad and the fish special, which was pickerel.  The salad was very nice, but the fish not so much: the flesh was a bit rubbery and bland.   The \"special of the day\" can always be a roll of the dice, and maybe I would have been better off sticking to the menu (friend had duck confit which looked great).    The service was warm and friendly, and they accommodated a couple of requests easily and graciously.    So, I wasn't wowed, but there were enough positives that I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"Had a really great meal at The Westerly tonight. We wanted to try somewhere different and we weren't disappointed. The food was really tasty including an amazing starter of brussel sprouts! The combination of sprouts, garlic, pecorino and aioli was delicious. I really enjoyed the mushroom risotto that I believe included a touch of truffle oil. My guests had great things to say about the cheeseburger with fries and fish of the day (arctic char). They had a good selection and beers and the service was friendly and informative. A wonderful find and we'll be back with friends who also live in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great neighbourhood, dim lighting, really cool vintage stereo... only guys with cool beards working, so pretty standard hip restaurant I'd say. The service was a little slow, but understandable for a Friday night... but they were really nice about it, and friendly... non of the entitled hipster attitude, which is common now for Toronto restaurants.   I liked the vibe of this place and do want to return, however the food didn't impress me much, it was good... but just not good enough if you're paying their prices. The highlight of the dinner was the perfectly made sticky toffee pudding, delicious. The hen and the burger were just decent. I think I'd stick to the brunch menu here from now on..."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday brunch at 10:30 am which was a good time as there wasn't any sort of line up. I believe the staff was short one man but the remaining crew hustled to ensure everything got delivered on time. It was a bit of a wait to get our coffee initially but it wasn't a hardship as it allowed my friend and I to catch up and chat. Our steak and eggs plates came out in good time and were exquisite. Flank steak was medium done and just delicious. It's a bit of a hipster-y neighborhood and you could see that reflected in the waitstaff, clientele and prices but overall, quite worth it."}
{"text":"The revival of Roncesvalles has led to a multitude of new openings. Among the list of new restaurants and hang outs is The Westerly. Before hitting a jazzy show at Gate 403, which happens to be almost next door to The Westerly, a friend and I decided to listen to the hype and pop in for dinner. The restaurant is relatively small, but with enough seating to keep it lively and buzzing in the evenings. We were fortunate enough to get seated immediately, albeit at the back near the kitchen, which is never my favourite location. I like to be in the action with a good view of other dinner guests (mainly so I can ask myself repeatedly \"Ohh...that looks good. I wonder what he/she ordered?), but one cannot complain when the food arrives and it causes your taste buds to have a dance party. The braised short ribs were muy tender and the horseradish mashed potatoes a delicious addition. After all, you cannot go wrong with meat and potatoes! Match the food with a nice bottle of wine from their extensive list and the night has only just begun!   The Westerly is an ace of a place and I would not be shy to return...but, I may be inclined to ask for a better seat next time...you can never go wrong at the bar, right!?."}
{"text":"I've only been there once, but it's already one of my favourite brunch places in the city, and I can't wait to return.  The French press coffee is one of the best I've had in the city.  So smooth and flavourful.  I had the creme brûlée French toast, which while it may be too sweet or rich for some, I found just delectable.  They have many less-sweet options like Monte Cristo or other egg dishes, and everyone at our table enjoyed their pick.  Plus, the service was great, so all in all, a great brunch destination."}
{"text":"Unlike many of the busy restaurants in the city, The Westerly does take reservations on Friday and Saturday night.  Unfortunately we didn't know that until we got there. We stopped in here on a random Friday night to find out all the tables were booked up for the night. The crowd was  mature (most were 50+). Luckily one of the reservations called to cancel not too long after we'd arrived and we were able to grab the last two seats at the bar.   The serving staff walked us through the menu recommending the scallops to start (delicious!), the trout and the braised short ribs. We also had their Georgian wine (from the country, not the state) that was really different from anything we'd had before. As a bonus, they two espressos we ordered to finish our meal were on the house.  We'll have to come back and try it out their raved about brunch."}
{"text":"This used to be our favourite brunch spot because the food was always so good but the last five or six times have been pretty bad, went back so many times because we just wanted so bad for this place to be as good as it was when it originally opened. Every time we went for brunch they lost our reservation, they have no idea how to greet and seat people. The servers and managers actually argued with each other in front of us. Rude servers, ridiculously long wait for food with no apologies, one server plonked a piping hot cup of coffee within 2 inches of my 8 month old baby and just walked off, luckily we had noticed what she had done and quickly removed it just in time to stop my daughter pulling it on top of herself. Such a shame, this place started off so well now it's just a disaster and not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I've been to the Westerly for brunch a few times (which is stellar btw) but never for dinner. I finally got around to going there for dinner last night, and it was a delightful experience. I ordered the braised short rib. It was perfectly cooked. I went to give my friend a bite and the meat fell apart with the touch of a fork. Beer selection was good, and service was friendly. One of my favourite things about this place is the feel of the place. It's very warm and comfortable, but not fussy.   My only gripe is that I hear they're taking the creme brûlée french toast off the brunch menu, which is criminal in my opinion."}
{"text":"Brunch with 5 people. Ambiance was lacking. Serving coffee in a French press was fun, but overall something lacked.  Had some sort of hash with eggs. Another person had the same thing. We both thought that it was blend and rated it 3 stars....until we found a long hair in his plate. We then noticed that someone (women) in the kitchen was not wearing a hair net....rating dropped to 2 stars  I would not return at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Thought it was pretty good and want to go back... shared four appies, the scallops, shrimp with grits, mozzarella and salmon gravlax latkes.  All of them were very good .  decent wine list and they have Aperol spritz cocktails which are deelish !   Service was great, we sat at the bar, nice décor. the only thing was the noise, the bartender was putting away clean cutlery & the station is close to the seating - it was literally being thrown into the drawers to the point even the table behind us commented.  the acoustics are so so anyway but with this is was really noisy  .."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch that residents of Roncy go to. The staff are friendly, the restaurant itself is cute, and the food is solid.  I had the Short Rib Hash - WOW - delicious!!!!  If you love Roncy and you love brunch, why aren't you here?"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner at The Westerly for the first time last night and had a really good meal. I went for the Sour Cherry Barbecue Chicken with Cheddar Grits and my wife tried the Pan Fried Trout. We both enjoyed our entrees and also the olive bread that was brought to the table. The staff were very friendly and the service was quite fast. I will definitely go back to try some more of the menu as everything looked pretty excellent!"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre brunch place in my opinion.   We started out with the Caesar drink which I had never had before. It was basically the same as a Bloody Mary. Definitely good, I would order again. I also liked that we had the option to make it mild, medium, or spicy. I got it medium, and it came with a celery stick and an olive. Honestly, the olive was amazing and so salty so we asked for more haha.  Our waitress was very friendly, but the food took FOREVER. Probably about an hour. My friend and I split the avocado toast and added poached eggs, and the bagel with lox. Both dishes were meh. The avocado toast was pieces of avocado with ricotta on top, but i was imagining (and I think it should have been) smashed avocado. The toast was also too soft in my opinion.  The bagel with lox was also meh. Not super flavorful. The side of bacon we got was the best, but only 3 pieces of TINY bacon for $4.  Overall, it was fine, but wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise going here today.  Would like to go back and hopefully see more lunch type meals"}
{"text":"A lovely setting, and a very warm welcome from hosts who know how to greet people and make them feel comfortable.  The service is exquisite: never condescending, never in-your-face, responds to questions, prompt, hip without being annoyingly hipster, a true pleasure.  The food, though, could use some refining.  First of all, too much on the menu has bacon, cheese grits, or both.  It would be nice to have a bit more variety.  Not everyone is of the mind that \"everything is better with bacon.\"  A bit more nuance with flavours would be appreciated.  My arctic char was perfectly seared, but was accompanied by an Israeli couscous with lobster that was lukewarm, and unpleasantly mushy.     Crust on the butter tart was quite tough, but the accompanying raisins were delicious.  Lemon tart was not of pristine freshness.  So all in all, a good experience, and definitely in the right direction.  But several missteps with the food that could be rectified with a bit more attention in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic dinner! Highly recommend. We shared the Brussels sprouts, ravioli and mussels- exquisite. One of the best ravioli dishes I've ever had. Loved everything about the experience. Everyone was welcoming and knowledgable . Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Came for a brunch here. We rolled in a bit late -- almost noon -- so there was not wait for a table. I split with my wife a burger and a benedict. Both tasted great. The burger was pitched as having short rib and other meats. It was tasty but a bit dry; it could have been cooked less.  The service was great and everyone was really friendly. This may merit 3 stars on food alone, but I will definitely return due to ambiance and proximity."}
{"text":"Such a great place to go on a cold, rainy night!   Had the special of the day: a gnocchi with lamb sausage. So tasty! Our waitress was lovely and the bartender recommended the perfect beer for my husband.   Will definitely come back. Next time, I'd love to try the brunch!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite short drinks list in the city. Any bartender that uses lots of gin, earl grey infusion and egg whites has my heart.  Try the Pimlet or the Brassica."}
{"text":"Overall underwhelming for the price. Had the eggs benedict (not sold on using a dry af biscuit in place of an English muffin) and a caesar. Neither was exceptional nor worth the $32 (incl tip and tax) price tag."}
{"text":"Stop 1 of  #AdasFoodCrawl  This was our meeting spot for a surprise Bachelorette for my foodie partner in crime. An afternoon of her favourite places and new ones (thanks to Public Yelp bookmarks), where we'd share only a few dishes between the 8 of us - I asked her to meet me here for brunch.   I love the atmosphere in here. Casual, yet with character, perfect for brunch or dinner, I liked the vibe.   When I made the reservation for 8, there was no hassle, which I loved. They made us a huge french press of coffee ($6) for us to share.   The server was really nice, and I felt badly that we didn't eat more. However, I'll definitely come back here after my little teaser today.   We had the Short Rib Hash, Frittata and the Eggs Benedict. Each amazing in it's own right, creamy and filling for sure, we wondered if we could even go to the next 7 places on the list.   Service was great, and good was good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 1/2 dozen times, and have been very impressed with the  Excellent service.  The staff is attentive, and friendly, and you can just tell that the owners set the bar at an intelligent level, knowing what it takes to keep customers coming back.     You absolutely must try the chicken liver crostini, as a starter to be shared.  It is 9 bucks, and just a great value.    Westerly burger is excellent value as well at 14 dollars, almost reminding me of burger priest's tender feel... however accompanying French fries need more seasoning...  The arctic char is an excellent main at 24, as is the gnocchi at 16.      When an owner or manager cares enough to meet you at the door... it starts your night off right..  The decor is cool as well... and they seem to have a private room in the back for special occasions."}
{"text":"I went along on Friday evening and had the most amazing meal at the Westerly. The ambiance was fantastic- friendly attentive caring staff and brilliant food. This is the place to be - and I can't wait to get back and visit! I particularly recommend the mussels!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. Always a pleasant experience. Can get packed fast, reserve ahead of time. Eggs Benedict is great. Hash is great. Bright, clean, and pleasant environment. Highly recommended. 4 stars for great value to $."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today. Maybe it was the heat, but it wasn't too crowded by the time we left at 11:20. There are not many veggie options-most dishes came with meat and I object to paying for something when I ask not to have it on the plate. Could they replace it with a small side? So I ate the frittata, which was nice and salty with feta and spinach. The ubiquitous sweet potato fries were okay, the salad was about eight big leaves, seven of curly lettuce, slightly bitter, and one piece of radicchio, lightly dressed. The half French press of coffee was better than standard, but not superlative. My friend said her Americano was really good. I would go again if I was in the neighbourhood, but it ended up being about $25 including tax and tip (service was fine) so a little bit on the high side of me. When I do go back, I'm getting the bread pudding. It looked amazingly decadent."}
{"text":"Have a great 4 course meal with wine and everything from the seats, service, food, drinks and dessert was absolutely perfect.  Everything was severed at the right temperature with a perfect drink pairing.  Windows were open and you almost felt like it was summer!"}
{"text":"Super nice food, the place is beautiful, waiters are nice, washrooms are clean and nicely decorated. Reasonable price, I will like more coffee for what I paid but overall is a cute place."}
{"text":"Have had brunch and dinner here a number of times, always delish. It's a beautiful room that keeps a balance between comfy and sparkly. Favourite menu items include meatball app, braised ribs, smoked trout anything, and for brunch the shrimp with cheese grits (they don't always have it though). Desserts are excellent as well.  Main floor washrooms are great too (no basement! yippee!)"}
{"text":"Went to the Westerly on a Saturday night and they were very accommodating for our group of seven. I liked the ambiance a lot and he servers were awesome w everyone. They have a nice private room in the back too. I had the scallops and hen w gnocchi - both were great. Others had the ribs, burger, mussels, cheese and meat plates, and sable fish. Wine was reasonable too and they had a good selection of local beer. Overall, a really nice experience. I'd do the shrimp and short  ribs or steak frites next time. Very cool place."}
{"text":"The food is very good at Westerly, we went for brunch and both of us liked out meal. It was very loud there though, if they added some noise absorbers it would help tremendously   The food took a little long to come out but not terribly. Everything was made fresh. Portions were much bigger then we thought; we orders home fries as a side but didn't end up eating all of them because we were too full from our meals."}
{"text":"Didn't  get a chance to eat there, the service at the door was so unbelievably rude.  It was amazing, I've never experienced such unprovoked hostility, even in the face of no reservation.  Don't know if it was because we had a child with us or just a supremely bad day on the part of the host/manager.  We certainly don't care to find out."}
{"text":"Great meal from start to finish!! We had the shrimp fritters , tomato salad , steak and short ribs.  Everything was fantastic !!     We finished with the banana tart.  Delicious !!! Great service as well.   We will be back"}
{"text":"Cozy, cute and comforting place for Saturday brunch. They also take reservations which is a definite plus! Stop by for your favourite American classics such as eggs Benedict, steak and eggs and their classic (eggs, bacon, hash and salad) . Everything was flavored well and the service was incredible warm and welcoming. I also appreciated that they let us linger and chat even after our meals were done."}
{"text":"Woooow. Easily, one of the best brunch joints in the city. The Westerly truly wowed me.  The menu in itself is pretty awesome & interesting. Brunch norms like Eggs Benny & Huevos Rancheros for those who like to stick to the classics, and items like Crème Brulee French Toast & Lemon Ricotta fritters for those who a.) have a crazy big sweet tooth (like myself) & b.) want to try something a little more unique!  In addition to being one of the best brunch joints, The Westerly has some of THE best French Toast, in my opinion. Though by no stretch of the imagination is it a traditional French Toast, it is AH. MAY. ZING. The brulee on top is tasty and delicious, the French Toast itself has a bit of a bread pudding type texture, but the flavours are fantastic. Seriously worth a try.  The Lemon Ricotta fritters remind me of timbits served on a mountain of whipped cream & blueberries. I wouldn't get this as an entrée, though I think they are great for the table to share! Fantastic, fluffy, & full of flavor!  On my most recent visit, I had the Monte Cristo. Yum. The Monte Cristo is one of my favourite breakfast dishes, and The Westerly does it right. Perfect amount of French Toast battering, just enough oozy cheese on the inside, and some delish smoked ham.  There was not ONE complaint about the food with my little party of 6 (oh, and did I mention, they actually take brunch reservations, so no hour long line for brunch with a group!), and I think it was a consensus among the group that each one of us will most certainly be returning.  Total gem of the Roncy area. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing brunch here!  My friends and I originally wanted to try another place down the street but they were slammed. We found The Westerly which is a beautiful bar that serves a kick-ass brunch.   We initially waited 15 minutes and our party of five were seated near the front windows. Every table was full, even the bar where a party of two or one can enjoy a meal.   The overall service was great. I do have to admit that our server seemed a little frazzled by how busy the place was. She wasn't overly unpleasant but didn't seem happy to be working there. But no matter, she was polite throughout our time there which is important.  The manager on the other hand was great, fantastic even.  She greeted us with a smile when we walked through the front door, was calm and collected, and was nice and attentive.   The brunch menu offers an array of different dishes for savoury or sweet palates but one dish caught my hungry eyes: Duck Hash.   The dish comprises of duck confit with two poached eggs, potatoes, bacon and mushrooms in a jus. It was perfect enough to be served for dinner. The duck meat was succulent and every ingredient soaked in the jus. It was delicious!  The Frittata won rave reviews at our table too. It's a veggie friendly, delicious dish that's served with spinach, roasted red peppers, goat cheese and potatoes.    Beautiful and inviting, The Westerly is a place I'd like to return again, for breakfast or dinner."}
{"text":"Food: We ordered Hash on the Ranch and Frittata.  There was nothing special about the dishes compared to the pricey bills. $4 side of 1 small breakfast sausage and 2 bacon - what a rip off!  Service: pretty slow - we waited 30 mins for the food.   Overall: I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"The Westerly is a great brunch spot and I am so glad we had chosen this place for the occasion!   They menu option isn't super long which we prefer because the more on the menu the more options and harder to narrow down the selection. We had the eggs Benedict (with cheese biscuit and ham - yum!) and the beef brisket hash. The brisket had a nice smokey flavour and the potatoes (home fries) were done to perfection or just the way we like it. It was so tasty.  I would love to go back for dinner. Overalll, this place is great for brunch if you are ever out in Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"Would give it a 3.5, but the price is steep! This place is super hipster (which I actually kinda like), but prices to match (your bank will cry). It's   Service is great! With a great selection of beers for all tastes (bonus points for letting you try things you MIGHT like, as I am not an experienced beer drinker). I also love when they being bread to the table (lost touch) and it was delicious homemade or baker bought).   Tried the venison with gnocchi (the venison was meh, just taste like well prepared steak, sides were DELICIOUS, definitely recommend the gnocchi!!), the burger was also great with DELICIOUS FRIES (I've also misspelled delicious twice, thank you autocorrect), and the Sunday special is a roast with sides (huge portion and delicious all around).   TL;DR: come for sides and beers!"}
{"text":"I got their eggs benedict and LOVED it. The portions were small but very well done. The place was small and cozy and had very friendly service. Would love to visit it again."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times. Once for dinner and once for brunch. The food is good, and the servers are quite friendly. The only thing that is missing in my is something that hooks me in... that hook could be the Créme Brulee French Toast., which was quite delicious and the texture was out of this world. I would order that if I went back for brunch. Just not positive if I'll be back to dinner anytime soon."}
{"text":"I would recommend the ricotta fritters since they melt in your mouth and are sinfully delicious!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about the place but took a long time to get around to going. Loved it. Great food and outstanding service!  Definitely going to start being more of a regular."}
{"text":"I've been to The Westerly for brunch three times now - twice I was thoroughly satisfied and once I was underwhelmed.  First off, let me say that the decor and atmosphere are one of the stand-out aspects of this restaurant. Everything from the brick and tile work around the foyer and the kitchen, down to the cutlery (which has a vintage feel and a pretty design on the handles), makes you feel comfortable, cozy and laid-back. Even the washrooms are well-decorated! The service is attentive and polite, and the manager/owner seems to always be present.  Our first visit was on Valentine's Day with a reservation made about an hour ahead - which I was impressed by. I couldn't begin to decide what I wanted off the menu between the Creme Brulee French Toast, the Huevos Rancheros and the Eggs Benedict. I went with the Eggs Benny and I don't regret my decision one bit. The home made cheddar biscuit that they use adds the perfect amount of flavour and texture and keeps the dish crispy. My boyfriend had a breakfast sandwich that he loved, but is no longer on the menu. I had a mimosa, and though tasty, it is tiny and not quite worth the $10 price tag.  On our second visit, I was again deciding between the Creme Brulee French Toast and a few other items on the menu. I wanted to try something new but had a craving for eggs and hollandaise sauce, so I decided on the Braised Shortrib Hash. This dish had the \"I'm-getting-rid-of-my-roast-dinner-leftovers-in-one-dish\" kind of vibe. There wasn't enough flavour or sauce, be it gravy or hollandaise. We also ordered a pot of french press coffee that arrived with a broken press and coffee grains everywhere. The waitress was quick to get us a new pot though and apologized.  A few weeks ago we went back for a third time; I ordered the Eggs Benny again because I couldn't eat there and NOT order it. My boyfriend ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich and it was delicious. We had the same positive experience as our Valentine's Day date.  To conclude, I have yet to try the Creme Brulee french toast... And I'm curious about their dinner menu (especially $30 prix fixe on Mondays with half price bottles of wine)."}
{"text":"Food is well prepared and has a cozy atmosphere. Brunch has decent selection of sweet and savoury options."}
{"text":"The Westerly came highly recommended, and after having had Crème brûlée French toast in Boston, I was eager to have it again (The Westerly offers a Créme Brulee French Toast for brunch).  1st Visit  The restaurant was cute and cozy and the staff was attentive and professional.  On to the food....  Crème brûlée French Toast: For starters, the French toast did not have any elements that reminded me of a Crème brûlée but rather, it was more like a bread pudding. I had no problems with that because I love bread pudding. The Crème brûlée French toast I have had has consisted of a rich custard base topped with a contrasting layer of hard caramel on a piece of French toast.  Monte Cristo: The Monte Cristo consisted of bread layered with smoked ham and gruyere cheese, free run Egg dipped and pan-fried. For some reason, I was imagining it to be closer to a grilled cheese than French Toast, but when I grabbed a piece, it was so soft that texturally alone was a turn off. The sandwich looked beautiful when it was placed in front of me. It was this appetizing gold color, and I was eager to eat the sandwich that I imagined would have a crispy exterior. But I was very disappointed to learn that appearances are deceiving. I know, I should have known better than to fall for the exterior before closer examination. After a couple of bites of the sandwich, I left it and began eating off my friend's plate. Lucky for me, she does not like whipped cream, so that is what I had for breakfast; whipped cream.  Coffee: My friends raved about the coffee here. And yeah, it was good. What I did not like was that online the price appears as $4.95 for a full pot, when in fact it is $5.95. Please update your website!  Cheddar biscuit with butter and jam: I am used to fluffy biscuits, specially after spending time in South Carolina. This biscuit was on the drier side and the jam was not the right fit for the biscuit. I ate one-half and left the rest.  Pan fried potatoes: they were swimming in onions so I did not eat any. Thank God that my friend loves onions and potatoes so she ate them all. I hate wasting food. The onion issue was on me, obviously. I failed to ask if their potatoes were cooked with onions.  Salad: I called it rabbit food. I did not taste any dressing, so it felt like I was chewing on grass. BUT, I am not a fan of plain salads, so again, this is my problem, not the restaurant's.  I did take the sandwich to go, and planned to fry the sandwich for breakfast. I fried it this morning, and it tasted a bit better, but because of the egg wash on the bread, it did taste like I was eating overcooked eggs. That's not what I had in mind for breakfast.  2nd Visit  The 2nd time around I brought 6 friends with me, and was really hoping to be converted to a lover of The Westerly. Unfortunately my 2nd trip here was a disaster in several ways.  Service   Our waitress was rude and pretentious. To try to get her attention, we had to physically get up and ask for her, or chase her down. The sub-par service made the ambiance difficult to appreciate. On a good note, those with young children would really appreciate this restaurant as it seems to cater to young families on weekends.  Food  I tried to apply the lessons I learned during my last meal here at this visit, and first requested an alternative to the potatoes. Our waitress told us that she could assure me that the potatoes I received would not have any onions in them. In fact! She stated that their potatoes never contained onions in the first place! Bullshit! I have eaten the potatoes that come with the brunch dishes before (1st visit), and they certainly had onions in them! But whatever! As long as you, a staff at this establishment, guarantee me no onions, then I am good.  Result?  Potatoes had onions Told our waitress about the onions and she looked at me like I was being a complete princess.  I imagined her thinking the following: \"Onions?! How the hell could someone not like onions?! Suck it up and eat them!\"--Mmm, if you could not omit the onions from the potatoes, you could have told me so, rather than lying! Salad still tasted like rabbit food Coffee was still too expensive and more so than my first visit All my guests thought the food was okay, but would not return-no dish was worthy of trying again in the future Argh, and why did the service have to suck and why did the waitress have to be so rude and unprofessional? Verdict?  Gave it two shots, and not worth a 3rd.  **This is an image (link below) of the Crème brûlée French toast that I had in Boston for under $8. It was incredible! http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/muls-diner-boston?select=tihKeDFZmzyBROFlbIPyMA#tihKeDFZmzyBROFlbIPyMA"}
{"text":"I've been to The Westerly twice and both times it was for brunch. Waits (from being sat to being served each course) can be especially (expectedly?) long on weekends and confusing (and frustrating) on less busy weekdays.   The slightly dry, but greasy duck hash and tres mignon smoked trout latkes are both decadent and delightful. The ever-present Beth, who I am assuming is an owner, is warm and personable, but some of the other staff feel under experienced.  Calling ahead won't get you a reservation (although I was once told over the phone that you could when they just opened), so just show up with a small party and/or early enough to snag a table."}
{"text":"Went there just for dessert and dessert wine on a Monday night and it was excellent.  Really classy and casual atmosphere.  The desserts were divine and they had a great selection of wine as well.  Service was friendly and quick. Looking forward to going back there for a full dinner!"}
{"text":"Booked a table for 4 on a Friday night and the restaurant was busy but not overwhelmingly so. Although most of the tables were full at 7pm, you could still easily carry on a conversation and the tables aren't crammed together so it doesn't feel crowded. The service was excellent but the food average. Our waitress Hannah was funny, friendly and was able to accommodate my husband's particular requests (he likes his food plain). I ordered a cocktail after asking the  waitress for a recommendation and loved it. It wasn't something I would have ordered based on the description in the menu but it was delicious. We spent a couple of hours enjoying our meal and the atmosphere but we weren't rushed by anyone to eat and get out. I'd come back for the drinks, service, and cosy decor. Looking forward to trying out the brunch!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a higher end place in the Roncy/Junction area. This place was amazing! We have eaten at a few top end places in different parts of the city, and this definitely holds a place in our top 5. They have an impressive wine list, creative dishes and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch based on the numerous positive Yelp reviews, and the fact that they take reservations for weekend brunch, which seems to be a rarity. We had a reservation for 2 at 10am, and when we arrived, there were only two other tables in the restaurant. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and my boyfriend ordered the Short Rib Hash. Although the restaurant was nearly empty, it took 45 minutes for our food to come out, and not once did anyone come over to check in on us or let us know the if food would be coming out shortly. When I tried to make eye contact with any of the servers, they just seemed to ignore me and walk away. When the food finally did come out, we both felt our meals was average at best (my plate basically consisted of two corn tortillas topped with lukewarm poached eggs, cold black beans, cold salsa and some cheese, and a heaping pile of field greens), and I felt it was overpriced for $14 a plate. I'd rather stand in line for 45 minutes for great food and great service than sit in a restaurant waiting for a mediocre meal. Won't return for brunch."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great menu that has something for everyone. Sunday roast is also a treat.   Good wine list and friendly staff.   Very fond of the seafood options here as well as the beef."}
{"text":"I came to the The Westerly a few weeks ago for brunch and I had to write a review because I LOVED everything about the place; the service, the food and the decor! We didn't make a reservation but it wasn't too busy when we arrived, so the server had no problems seating us.   The restaurant itself has a laid back and warm atmosphere, I love the the wooden floors and chandeliers. I ordered the creme brûlée French toast and it was to die for. It's the best French toast I've had in Toronto and I will be bringing my friends and family here when they come visit!!!"}
{"text":"Ooooo, a treat!  I've been eyeing The Westerly for a while as part of my ongoing eating tour of Roncesvalles.  We rolled in last night and were impressed.    We each ordered an appetizer: the bf got curry mussels and I had the ricotta gnudi (the latter of which comes in an entree size) and both were delicious.  The curry had almost no heat but had potent flavour; the gnudi was rich and cheesy with some memorably delicious mushrooms.    Entrees: Bf got pickerel on cheesy grits and I got the lamb shank.  I was especially impressed with the pickerel.  Fish has the tendency to not ever feel like an overly hearty or decadent choice, but the bed of super cheesy grits complemented the fish and elevated its richness.  My lamb shank was extremely soft and whatever cooking method was applied brought out all the nice flavour inherent to the meat. It came with perfectly cooked couscous and blanched green beans.  Everything was top-notch and reasonably priced.  The Westerly doesn't feel like it's trying to be overly adventurous, but it's still unique, high-quality dining.  Ambience-wise, it's a great place for an intimate meal.  I can't wait to try their brunch."}
{"text":"The waitress greeted us with a genuine smile...very attentive. Food was delicious.  I had the Monte Cristo sandwich and my company had a Eggs Benedict... Delicious and cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"I liked the Westerly but didn't love it.    The atmosphere is modern; clean lines, marble and sharp edges.  It comes off a bit cold, especially for brunch.  On the positive, the windows are large and there is a lot of natural light.  The food itself was solid but not particularly inspired.  The Huevos Rancheros was good but not especially flavorful.  I really liked the French Pressed coffee but overall there was nothing that really stood out to me.  It was good... but not memorable."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, and a great place to have a party in their back room.  The manager gave me so much help in planning my birthday in December, and accommodated 2 prix fixe menus at once for all of my guests (after sending a preemptive google doc of our orders).  So wonderful, and our server (I think his name was Bruce) was our personal bartender with festive shirt with little Santa's peppered into it.  Food is always great, likewise of the service.  Keep coming back."}
{"text":"A nice relaxed neighbourhood resto.  Bistro style food that is all good but nothing that stands out as exceptional.  Prices are reasonable and the service is good.  I was not impressed with the wine list.    Just an anecdote on the wine.  They have a few wines from Georgia.  Having tried Georgian wine when I was in Russia, I decided to pass, but our server insisted that I try a taster.  I did.  I still decided to pass."}
