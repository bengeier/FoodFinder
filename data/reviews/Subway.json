{"text":"A guy made the best subway sandwiches I've ever gotten. Said he's been working there 4 years and that he was 19. Whoever that guy is... Deserves an award"}
{"text":"It unfortunate that this is so close and convenient to me. The food is fresh, which is the only reasom I go. The employees have such an attitude EVERY time I go. I have never been there and had a good experience with the workers. They are incredibly rude. Also during times that are busy, especially lunch, they only have one employee in the building. So the line will go to the door. I was in there when that has happened and 3 people came in and waited for a minute then walked right out. Something needs to be done on how rude they are."}
{"text":"I get take out there 3 or 4 times a month every month  since the store opened a couple of years ago.  I've never had a bad sandwich and never met an unplesant employee.  Clean & polite & decent prices."}
{"text":"This subway is about average. We order take out weekly and have no complaint about sandwich quality.  But for the past couple of months, at least, they are not replacing the ink in the register ticket.  Not one time!!  When my wife hands me the receipt, I can't read it at all to see what to enter in my charge card account.  She has complained to them about it, but it hasn't changed."}
{"text":"It is like any other Subway. Food is good, restaurant is clean. However, as I walked in, there was an employee and her friend sitting at tables no more than 5 feet from the door, both smoking. I had to walk through the smoke to get into the restaurant. Stuff like that is a deal breaker for me. I will go to Quizno's next time."}
{"text":"I love the convenience of this place the subs are good and fresh and healthy and fresh."}
{"text":"Staff (both sandwich making and cashier) are poorly trained and provide a subpar customer experience. Had to repeat my order 3 times and I did not want cheese but still had to stop her after she put the first slice of cheese on my sandwich."}
{"text":"If I could put negative -1 star I would, this place is beyond horrible. I ordered a chicken sandwich which gave me food poisoning. When I was at the drive-thru, I literally worried 20-30 mins that's what I could remember from when I started keeping tracking I probably stayed there longer.


If I could back up and leave I would've but there were cars behind me. 


Recommend NOT to go."}
{"text":"This location is open at the most convenient time... for management.  Store hours say 9-9 everyday.  Doesnt actually open until 11 and closes sometime in the evening.  Not sure how this franchisee gets away with this as they are contractually required to be open a certain number of hours a week.  If management is willing to run its franchise like its its own wholly owned small business ignoring its contractually obligations of the franchisor, what does it say about the quality of the place."}

Toppings were minimal. Had to ask to give me more lettuce. Twice this occurred. Avoid this one"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something to eat, AVOID this subway at all costs! I had the WORST customer experience of my life there. I went through the drive through to order my food. After pulling up to the window, I paid and waited patiently for my food. Ten minutes goes by and I start to wonder what the heck is going on. Twenty minutes hits and I'm angry. I try getting the workers attention through the window and both blatantly ignore me. I try knocking on the window and honking my horn. Still they ignore me. Finally, the guy opens up the window and hands me half my order saying he's sorry for the wait. He didn't even have my entire order! I tell him that I want a refund and he says the other worker will have to do it. At this point, I'm waiting for 25 minutes. I honk my horn more. The girl worker opens up the window and asks for my receipt for the refund. Turns out the receipt she printed me was blank so they couldn't figure out how to give me a refund. I'm pretty much on the verge of tears bc I'm so frustrated and ask for my debit card back so I can just leave. Never ever go here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here the location is convenient the staff is always friendly & nice one time I went 2 hours before closing & the workers Natasha & Jennifer had no manners did not say hello did not even ask to take my order I had to ask them!! Acted like they did not want me there !"}
{"text":"This store used to be OK, but over the past year it has gone down hill faster than Sonny Bono-- and with similar results. I visited the drive thru this week and wanted to order the Reuben, which is the monthly special. That sandwich didn't appear on the touchscreen menu at the drive-thru so I pushed the button to speak to an employee. The employee told me to enter in a different kind of sandwich and they would know to make the Reuben instead. Well, when I tried to do that -- surprise -- Swiss cheese, which is supposed to come on the Reuben, wasn't listed as an option on the touchscreen because it's not standard. I had the same problem with the special Rye bread not being listed. I hit the button again but the employee didn't respond a second time. I had no idea what was going to come out of that drive-thru window now, but I was pretty sure it wasn't going to be my Reuben. After waiting 30 minutes for the three cars in front of me to get their orders I finally arrived at the window. I honestly believe that, until this very day, the employee, who was the same person I spoke to through the speaker, thought that a Reuben was that dude who beat Clay Aiken on American Idol. But she had no prior knowledge that it was also a sandwich. That was a new concept for her. So there I was at the window and my sandwich wasn't ready, as she had promised it would be. She then took my order on a paper pad like a freaking savage. I requested Swiss cheese, because, hey, it's a Reuben, but she said she didn't have Swiss and that American would have to do--yuck!! I asked for Rye and she said they didn't have Rye. Then, her manager overheard this and told her that in fact they did have Swiss and Rye, so yay me! I then asked this lady, who I assume was employee of the month, to put thousand island dressing on it, because, again, Reuben. Her eyes betrayed a bewilderment that I hadn't seen in a human since my younger brother first saw my mom working out to a Richard Simmons VHS tape in 1987. My gawd. The lady proceeded to close the window in order to, presumably, make my Reuben. I realized that I never told her to put corned beef on my Reuben (obviously, I assumed she knew I didn't want a vegetarian Reuben, but at this point I was losing confidence in this chick's sandwich knowledge faster than a knife fight in a phone booth). So I gently knocked on the window. She tentatively opened the window with a look of dread as if she thought I was the Alex Trebek of Reubens who was going to quiz her about the essential components of any sandwich that would dare wear that moniker. So, I then asked her if she was going to put corned beef on my Reuben and she said, and I quote, \"You think I'm going to serve you a Reuben without corned beef?\" To which I replied, \"Ma'am you wanted to serve me a Reuben with American cheese.\" She retorted, \"The guy in the back makes the sandwiches, he knows how to make a Reuben.\" Me: \"Mmmmmk.\" 10 more minutes passed. She then asked me to pull into a parking space because their sandwich making artist was clearly YouTubing how to make a Reuben and the store's Wi-Fi was acting up. I did as instructed and waited another 10 minutes. FINALLY, Miss Reuben emerged from the Subway Restaurant, Reuben in hand, and presented the finished sandwich to me. I thanked her for her help in facilitating the creation of my Reuben. She returned to the store. I opened the wrapper, fearful of what I might find tucked inside. Alas, soggy Rye bread and no thousand island dripped upon the watery sauerkraut. Hmm, I thought the sandwich artist knew how to make a Reuben. In fact, I was shocked that corned beef appeared on the sandwich at all, but a Reuben without thousand island is just a lunchbox sandwich whose own mother wishes that the only drug store in her small hick town wasn't owned by a crotchety Southern Baptist who refuses to stock copious amounts of Plan B. So, in total, I waited 55 minutes for a soggy, flavorless, sauceless, unloved mess of a sandwich. Total waste. AVOID this place!!!"}
{"text":"The guys working were talking shit about me because I didn't hear what one of them said the first time. Thankfully, my boyfriend did hear them. The guy making my sandwich also decided that extra onions means adding three extra little pieces. I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before. Ever. I will gladly walk the extra mile to the other subway. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Personally this subway is one of my favorite locations. Super clean, great staff, and best of all perfect sandwiches every time and if your clubbing, this location is exactly what you need being open till 3am on weekends. They also have wifi and are more than accommodating."}
{"text":"The terrible service was incredible trays that were supposed to be full of vegetables and add-ons for your sandwich were for the most part empty are looks so junky it was pathetic they were out of most of the things and had a real bad attitude in serving a sandwich I'll never go in again, they should just close the place it's the worst"}
{"text":"They don't carry spicy mustard. Excuse is that it goes bad before they can sell it. Really? Only subway I've ever been to that doesn't carry all the same stuff. I mean how much does a case of spicy mustard really cost anyways? Sad!"}
{"text":"The service here is great. I'm always greeted with a smile. 

There are a few new servers that I've seen use the same gloves on the cash register and then go back to making sandwiches but the more senior staff, when present, always makes a point to remind them to put on a new pair. 

Throughout the work week the veggies are all very fresh. On the weekends, there were a few times that the cucumbers looked a little frosty/frozen but this hasn't been the case in the last few months -- maybe there is higher cucumber turnover or the restaurant has made more of an effort to restock fresh veggies. Either way, I gladly return on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"As far as I know this is the only subway in Oakville that's open 24 hours and that alone is worth 5 stars. I rarely have the desire or intent to eat a sub before 1am so this place has been a life saver on a couple occasions. 

Unfortunately the downside to any subway (at least the ones in Oakville) is that they're always severely understaffed so even if there are only a couple people in front of you, be prepared to wait because there will likely only be one employee working and English is likely their second language so be patient."}
{"text":"This place is in a good area however it is very very dirty and The music is way too loud.  Will never eat here again :("}
{"text":"This location is not too bad. The bread is soft and everything makes me happy. BUT the staff in here, they are too mean. The make fun and they did not make the right bread you want. They did not take the hot bread for you. They laugh at you when you get trouble. The last thing, I would recommended to everyone, SHOULD NOT come here. THEY ARE TOO RUDE. I really do not like the service in here"}
{"text":"Worst subway experience ever.

1. Instead of microwaving the bread and cheese like I had to ask and repeat myself 3 times, they toasted the whole thing, for a prolonged period of time so the bread is practically hard like a stone. 

2. They forgot to include the ham of my sub. It was a ham subway. Are you serious? When I pointed it out, they rudely implied it was my fault for having them only heat up the cheese + bread and not the meat. Seriously?

3. Instead of charging me the price of foot long, they charged me TWO 6-INCHES. I didn't realize until later.I understand it's only a couple dollars or so, but practically everyone who goes is a student. So, no.

4. Every employee was rude. Except the Asian cashier who charged me extra.

Never am I going there again. I'd rather get the overpriced Starbucks sandwich from now on."}
{"text":"I think this is a great place to dine in if your ever in a rush but want to eat something decent. Good food, fast service, and overall good, but I find the insistence on getting certain ingredients by the server sometimes annoying and guilt tripping depending on the ingredients."}
{"text":"Got a great sandwich tonight.  Awesome fresh food and great sandwich maker.......had the footlong on white tuna was a great sandwich.  And a bag of chips.....lol"}
{"text":"I've been working in the food service industry for quite some time and am fairly easy going and understanding when I go out to eat. So the fact that I'm complaining to begin with is a big deal. First , there were three people working and one person in line ahead of me. No one acknowledged my presence or even made eye contact with me for the whole time they made his sandwich....When the boy behind the counter finally said something to me...it was \"Sorry. What do you want?\"
I asked for itailian bread, he got white, I asked if it was the Italian and he said it was....spoiler alert, when I got home with it, it wasn't itailian, it was white. Oh well. Bread is bread. Back to the rude people making my sandwich. I asked for a specific sub, he said I had to pick all the ingredients myself. So I asked for everything that came in that sub and he asked me to tell him what come sin it. Then he made a big deal about having to turn around and look at the picture of the sub. The other lady sort of rolled her eyes at me. I was still trying to be pleasant at this point even though I was getting pretty frustrated that no one was helpful and made me feel like I was inconveniencing then for even coming in. Like they had better things to be doing. When I finally paid for the sub, the lady asked again what sub I had....like she didn't just help make it. 
Nine of these things by themselves would have been upsetting, except for the lack of humanity in these employees. But all of those little, snide, rude mannerisms just made it such an unpleasant event to get lunch! And, like I said, when I opened up my sandwich, it was wrong. 
I won't be back, and I'll certainly tell my friends to avoid it. 

There's a great Whataburger in that same parking lot. Phenomenal. 

This Subway location is not terrible, but the staff is just rude and barely alive."}
{"text":"I know, I know a review for Subway, come on.  But I have to say that the service at this subway is top notch.  The staff is very friendly and always goes out of there way to say hello.  It is highly appreciated.  The food is pretty standard Subway fare.  Not too much to say there, but I will be be back again on my lunch breaks."}
{"text":"This is the worst Subway I've ever been to. The staff are rude, sloppily create sandwiches, and have horrible hygiene practices (he dropped a tomato on the ground and tried to put it on my sub)  Would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"I do normally go to subway 3 times a week. Today when I went in at 9.45pm I ordered the food and the food is good but there are 2 workers working at that time a boy and a girl. After me and my wife took the food and sat down at around 9.50pm they said u must leave by 10 because we will close at 10 and I said OK. In between one old woman who finished her order and when she left those workers are commenting on her and I can hear that clearly. That's not the way how they should be they should have manners.

And the main thing exactly at 10 lady came and said u must leave now and I requested for 5 more minutes.and she said OK but immediately after a 2 min she came in again and asked us to GET OUT and I got obsessed and I asked her do we need to stop eating right now and leave can't u give us 5min and immediately another guy came with a shouting voice and said GET OUT right now. I haven't faced this type of experience anytime in my life. He then said GET OUT right now or we will call cops. I don't know that 5 more minutes after closing time is a big crime. I said OK and we left the food on the table and we left.

This is the bad bad experience in whole life and I don't want to go to that subway again. I don't know about other workers but these 2 are so so bad and I dont know why subway hires such a bad guys.

Plz guys give customers some respect and plz learn manners go to some school.

And also when I asked for Avocado in my sub he said we will not serve Avocado after 9.30pm and when I speak to the store manager a day later they said they will serve till closing time. Is this the way they tell lies to customers by not providing the available item. 

Thanks,"}
{"text":"Very bad. Worst subway I've been too. The people who work there are even worst then  greasy subs they make"}
{"text":"Subways  are usually predictable so you know what to expect,  but I live a tenth of a mile from this one and have lunch there frequently.   The subs  are about the same as all the other stores.  The problem is the staff.  They don't seem to be as well trained and efficient as other Subways.   The personnel changes frequently so maybe the owner has other stores he rotates them with.  Even when he fills in he seems so disinterested and distant you'd never know it's his place.  Would never go there if it weren't so convenient."}
{"text":"I went today and noticed a worker taking opening a vault with food to replenish the containers up front. He used gloves to open the vault door then went to unload the food into the bins touching the food with the gloves that were used to open the vault door. I did not think this was sanitary."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible and Horrible service at this place, I regret even going to this place, I should of followed others reviews and gone elsewhere and drove a few extra miles. The two Ladies working there have no manners, full of attitudes, don't even listen to their customers, what the heck is state allowing this business keep running? If I worked for the State I would of made sure that this place shut down within days. People don't go there, spend your a few dollars elsewhere somewhere that they deserve to have your local business. Stupid people needs to learn customer service and listen to their customers.. and Subway, do not contact me about this review. And no I'm not taking this post down.. if I could give them Zero Star I would of..."}
{"text":"I've never had great experiences at this location but never felt like it was worth it to write a review, but tonight's experience pushed me over the edge. My mom and I went to subway because it was one of the quickest places to eat around that was still open. We walked in at 9:30 and they closed at 10. We felt like that gave us enough time to and we weren't going in right before they closed. Well the employees must have thought differently because they were giving us attitude from the get go. One of the ladies was at least trying to be pleasant but the other one was not whatsoever. She acted as if us walking into the store was a huge inconvenience to her and the fact that we stayed and ate there made it even worse. But what made it even worse was that while we were eating, they turned off the front lights so only the back, counter lights were on and they locked the front door before they were even closed. If they were closed and we stayed past their operating hours, I would understand such treatment but considering they locked the doors and turned the lights off while they were supposed to be open was both, bad business and super inconsiderate to those that were still in the store. I'm infuriated by their poor customer service"}
{"text":"I like subway because everything is fresh and healthy. but especially in this place I like to order to go and catering super fast and friendly"}
{"text":"I have only been here two times and I am never coming back. I came in around 1 o'clock in the afternoon and there was one person in front of me and one person behind me. Three ladies were working, the woman who was making my sandwich did not speak English that well and kept staring at me, I would say lettuce she would grab tomato I would say chips she gave me a blank stare. Service was veeeerry slow when it was clear that we were all just trying to grab lunch and head back to work. When I finally got to the register with the woman who was making my sandwich we were at a closer distance and her body odor was overwhelming, made my eyes water and singed off my eyebrows and lashes. It was SO HORRIBLE, I paid for my sandwich and was completely grossed out I didn't end up eating it."}
{"text":"I grabbed a veggie sub today in the Squirrel Hill Subway!  Staff is CONSISTENTLY upbeat and friendly.  Ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"To the manager of this Subway: I want to personally recognize one of your employees for outstanding service. Tonight I visited this store in Goodyear by the Frys Marketplace for the first time. A young lady named Janell was my sandwich artist. She was so kind and patient and helpful, and made the absolute best Subway sandwiches we have ever had. She assembled them with care and it is evident by how nice they look as well as how wonderful they taste. I realize this may sound silly talking about a sandwich, but to me it shows that she takes care and ownership of everything she does. My husband remarked \"this is the best subway sandwich I have ever had, and it looks so nice!\" Before I even told him about the young lady that helped me. Please recognize her for her commitment to excellence and customer service."}
{"text":"This Subway is closest to me, but I'd rather travel to another. While there are a handful of friendly employees here, the majority of them are not. They usually don't clean the knife in between sandwiches so my sandwich will be covered in whatever the person in front of me ordered. This location seems to constantly run out of bread and be left with only one type even in the afternoons. I've gone several times where the employees have closed 15-20 mins early and make me feel like a bother for trying to get a sandwich when they are still open. The last time I went there was no air conditioning on in the store even though it is really hot out, so my cold sub felt like it was toasted by the time I got it. The meat was disgusting and hot and when I contacted the manager asking for a refund, I was ignored."}
{"text":"I actually have had poor experience in the past, however they seem to be cleaning up their act. Two years ago the people working would make fun of me and offend me. They make a great sub, and have really cleaned up the place. They still need to improve in customer service and the presentation of the sandwiches. They mixed up my sub a few weeks ago and I brought my receipt back and they gave me the sandwich, however the guy seemed to not believe me. They corrected the error and went on my way. They're getting better for sure."}
{"text":"Subway is like any other fast food restaurant, but come on? This location doesn't even have a trace of customer service or care. I have come to this location in the ballpark of 40 or 50 times and this last visit was the worst. The girl making my sandwich was sick and sniffling all over the place. Talk about disgusting. Call out would ya. She also didn't say more than 15 words while she made the sandwich. Makes things extremely uncomfortable. I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Employees are always super nice and efficient. They make your sub perfectly everytime and the establishment is always clean. They take pride in their work!"}
{"text":"This subway is open 24 hours. The bread was fresh and they honor national specials. Even with fresh bread the sandwich wasnt all that great (got the turkey breast). There was only 3 slices of meat which I think is less than a typical subway 6 inch."}
{"text":"Thankfully there is another Subway close by and I will not have to return to this one.  Ice tea dispensers were empty and store was out of ice.  Employees didn't bother to say anything about there being no ice or any tea and then refused to refund the drinks.  I was told the manager was out of the store buying ice and he would \"deal with it\" when he got back.  Rude employees and it took 30 minutes for two of them to make my order of 3 sandwiches."}
{"text":"Subway..typical subway. You really can't go wrong here unless bad service. Love their macadamia nut cookies!"}
{"text":"I ordered a few 12 inch sandwiches , a turkey and a chicken... wanted avocado...they were out!
Really?? This store is in the same parking lot as SMITHS Grocery and these lazy and UNEMPOWERED employees can't take a five'r over there and buy a few avocado's for peoples sandwiches???  Subway needs to look at their policies, training, and allow their people to be able to satisfy their customer's needs....Adios!!"}
{"text":"If you are college student trying to use the discount coupons, don't go here they don't accept coupons. Just walk across to Yonge street. Thank me for saving your time. :)"}
{"text":"The parking lot was nearly empty, but as soon as we got to the drive through they told us to wait for 10 minutes while they took care of the line inside. They were out of more than 50% of the menu. We had to repeat our simple request 3x before they understood it. Then before we were even done with our order, they cut us off with our total and told us to pull forward.  Crap service for sloppy, sub par food. Not coming back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I came here! First time I walked out there was one person serving and she took forever I'm back again and the same shit.  Please owners don't be cheap hire another person. Service is really bad. I also see people walking out because they do t want to wait. You guys are loosing money"}
{"text":"Subway is Subway. The food was roughly the same...BUT only go there if you are not going to need the restrooms!!
The smell was so bad that the children I was with ran out, refusing to go to the bathroom! Sadly, when we brought the issue to the attention of the staff, we were met with a shrug. 
I can't help but question the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. 
I won't be back."}
{"text":"Usually I have very minor issues with this Subway. I think their food tastes better than  any other Subway I've visited. 
Occasionally they have soup. During this visit, and another time a month ago, I ordered soup. The first time they put the soup in the bag, then the sub and held it upright. I was getting my drink so I didn't notice. The soup had opened and was filling 1/2 inches of the Subway bag.  Well, tonight... they had seperate bags, nothing spilled. The guy getting the soup seemed to be scraping the bottom. I didn't mind, someone has to eat the last. When I got home the cup of soup was just barely over 1/2 on the container and barely warm. See photo. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. I walked in and was promptly greeted. The staff was extremely friendly and very quick."}
{"text":"I started coming to this Subway because it's close to work but after coming here 4-5 times over the last two months it's consistently sub-par.  The floors are always dirty likes it's an auto shop.  The last three times I've been to this store they have been out of several bread choices...  today they only had white.  (1 for 5 isn't good)  There bathroom is always completely out of paper towels too...  you need to wash up before arriving.   Save yourself the headache and eventual disease."}
{"text":"This Subway restaurant- Village Green Place in SW Champaign- is the best I have ever been to...and I have been to a lot of Subway restaurants.

The very polite staff will not skimp on your sub, let me tell you.  My footlong Veggie Delight always invariably ends up weighing about five pounds.  None of that pinch of lettuce, put an extra paper-thin tomato slice back here!  They even give me spinach and carrots on it!  All other Subway restaurants are pale in comparison.  Even if you have to walk or bike across town to get your sub from here, you should."}
{"text":"Dirty and rude........their sandwhich boards are nasty and they dont wear gloves. The soda fountain  machine is not up to code. There was hair in my food the owner refused to remake or refund my money. Just nasty! The employees count out peppers and skip on product to save money. This place should be shut down"}
{"text":"Not the very best experience ever the girl named Celeste that worked at 9:00pm april first was rude i like mayo in my sandwich and she told me that what i requested was disturbing because she hates mayo. Who would say that make the sandwich its not yours to eat. Worst experience ever made me feel really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"They opened the door 7 minutes late, with no apology. I went in there specifically for a buy-one-get-one-free promotion that was supposed to run all of April, but all their signage was for May (it's April 30) and they'd taken the promotion out of the computer, so there was no reason for my visit. I didn't get the deal. They rang up my sandwich at the wrong price. I got no receipt. The only redeeming quality is that they didn't skimp on the veggies like they usually do, but next time I'll just skip this store altogether."}
{"text":"This subway is so gross. Not even clean. The girl was on break and came back from break and didn't even wash her hands and got right on the floor to make my sandwich. I would give this 0 for cleanness and health hazard."}
{"text":"Love this location, the staff is always friendly and presentable (unlike other locations).  The food is fresh about 98% of the time, the counters are always clean, the food itself is always in the proper bins and looks very tidy. They always have enough bread and seem to have all kinds available, the bread is always soft and fluffy, never overcooked. I always enjoy the sandwiches here. 
The only negative, sometimes when you come in no one is up front and you need to wait a few minutes or yell for someone to come help you."}
{"text":"This is a tough one to review...we used the drive thru service which was incredibly slow (one car ahead of us). I was doubtful from the beginning that a drive thru could run efficiently for a Subway. When we pulled up to the window we had a coupon, the employer helping us, Courtney, took it but another employee, Kathy, snapped that we couldn't use it. Courtney explained that the coupon had their specific location on it and ended up phoning a manager to ask. The manager approved the use of our coupon. While waiting for our order to be made we saw Kathy sneeze, into her shirt, but with gloves on she held the front of her shirt. Now we all know that spit, viruses, and bacteria still pass thru shirts. Was it better than sneezing into the air? Sure. Should she have still at the minimum changed her gloves? Yes; but did she? Of course not. She then also adjusted her hair behind her ears with the same gloves and continued right along making sandwiches. The order Courtney made for us was correct and she was very pleasant to deal with however I would not return to this location because of Kathy and what we witnessed and her general attitude."}
{"text":"I come here very often and have seen almost every employee that works here. My least favorite, is a lady named Rylan. I walked in to get my sandwich of course and I expected a nice greeting and a smile. Nope. Neither one. She gave me an attitude when asking what I wanted and didn't even say have a great day when I left. She has no respect for her customers and gives off terrible looks to people in line and definitely doesn't change her gloves I watched her type something on the register where I checked out and make someone else's food right after that's downright disgusting I'm not coming back any time soon there's a vistancia subway I go to now instead"}
{"text":"Do not go here. The employees are rude, they throw your food together like it doesn't matter and throw a fit if you ask for a receipt. I am HAPPY to drive a little farther to go to another location. 67th Ave & Bethany is a good location and 59th Ave & Northern is my FAVORITE location. I will never go to the Subway on 83rd Ave & Glendale again."}
{"text":"The food was expectational, nothing special .. The service was horrible. Young kids that hate their life. One girl, Kristen, is so rude it's pathetic. It's not the costumers fault your life decisions ended you up at subway."}
{"text":"Came in, bought a sandwhich, and all of the sudden I was wearing pants that were like 100 sizes too large. I guess eating hoagies does make you lose weight like Jared, the guy sitting in the corner, told me it would. Seems like a cool dude. I probably wouldn't let my kids go near him but he seems nice enough. 

Bread was fresh and tuna was the normal subway tuna that we all dream about. Can't complain really. 

Eat fresh!"}

{"text":"Horrible experience. 
Starting with walking in the door the gentleman eating in the back while on his phone did NOT WASH HIS HANDS before attempting to make my sandwich. After looking at the meats, cheeses, and veggies I opted to walk out. I do intend on calling the health department as this is not acceptable behavior for any food establishment. 
I was in there between 9:45pm and 10:05pm. I'm wearing the black Absolute shirt holding my sweatshirt, with the second gentleman in shorts and has a beard. 
Verify on camera please.
I was told I would be charged for a meat item I have never been charged before for. It was a substitution and and even then he failed to follow any customer service techniques I know. Please not, I am in the restaurant industry. I have worked my way from a Subway as my first job, to becoming an Regional Manager for a large chain restaurant group. This is not what Subway us about. No engagement, absolutely no resolution, and worst of all couldn't look me in the eyes. Customer service 101. 
When we walked in we were the only ones in there and the store looked unacceptable to any descent health or Subway standard. We were unpleasantly greater by the gentleman eating while on phone. I can go on and on but I think you got it. 
I will not return here, nor refer you to anyone I know. Unfortunately I just moved to the area and you are less than a block away from my gym/home and I eat 3-5 times per week after my work out. First and last time here. I'm disappointed..... 
Thanks.
Have a great night."}
{"text":"Dear anyone who gives less than 5 stars,

It's subway. You knew what you were getting when you walked in. The food is the same as any other subway. And of course the workers don't want to be there. It's subway. I go in just to remember how glad I am to not work at subway. Each of those workers is a shining example for me to work harder at my job so that I never have to be as unhappy as they are. I love this subway. 

Oh, it also rocks that it's open 24/7. So in case you are tossing and turing in the middle of the night thinking about quitting your job, you can walk into this subway at literally any time and remember how good you have it at your 9-5. 

Thank you subway workers. You are the best free therapy there is."}
{"text":"Came here a while ago numerous time and since then I moved ,before it was just perfect now on my first visit in months let me say I'm not that please their way under staffed and to rushed in my opinion"}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I could. Only 2 people working at 11:15 AM which is obviously lunch rush. Unacceptable. The female was polite and felt bad for a bunch of us having to wait way too long in line but the male was rude and uncaring. He ignored me totally after I had received my food and then discovered the men's room was locked. Fortunately, the nice lady working helped me right away. Would never return."}
{"text":"Not usually one to stop at subway but sounded good in the moment. And I'm glad i stopped at this one! Fantastic service hands down. I now know why they call them sandwich artist haha"}
{"text":"The sandwich of the day was a six inch meatball, and after 20 minutes (no kidding - 20 minutes) of waiting, they told us it would take another 8 minutes to make.  Their flux capacitor or something was broken.  Ok, so we asked for a refund because we were stupid and prepaid.  They said they didn't know how to give a refund, so I promised them this review for my $6."}
{"text":"The man who helped us was working around 12am Thursday morning. Don't remember his name but he was nice and quick to take our orders! Food, awesome like always. Music is playing to keep the mid-night vibes going and it was nice and chili in there so you can escape the vegas heat! 24hr must I mention!!"}
{"text":"Expensive standard subways prices. Rude service (probably because they treat everyone like the high school kids next door). No air conditioning! I'll only go when I'm desperate for a sub and have coupons."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the free breakfast on the way to work.  The sign up site had several choices, of which I chose breakfast BMT. Gabby was working the counter and told me that the BMT was not one of my options.  After a couple of less than understanding responses, she agreed to give it to me anyways. I understand that she must have been told something different by a manager than what the promotion was actually offering, but a little bit of friendly customer service would be nice. luckily, the breakfast flatbread was pretty tasty. Would eat it again, but maybe from a different location."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding!! The girl who made our sandwich this morning went above and beyond."}
{"text":"June 8th 15:58:13

Dear Diary,

Today I figured out how to restart songs on my phone using only my headphones. I had no idea of how to do this before and I'm so happy I figured it out!

This school is so good now 

With Love,

{"text":"This subway is like every other subway. The setup is exactly the same just like every other one. What makes this one special is that it's never busy. You're in and out in less than five minutes. Beautiful. As long as it's never busy I will always go to this one"}
{"text":"After watching the Subway episode of Undercover Boss, I kind of expected a different experience.  Took my kiddos there for a later-than-normal dinner (almost 9pm).  We were the only ones in the place and had to wait for the employee to finish eating before ordering.  Not only did they (yes, there were 2 employees) not greet us, but they chatted amongst themselves with their backs to us.  When they finally got around to us, I asked for a 6\" tuna on flatbread.  They were out of flatbread.  Since I don't like their bread to begin with, I went without.  

My kiddos ordered a 6\" meatball and a 6\" BLT.  Not hard orders to make and thankfully they were correct.  Two combo meals (6\" sub with a drink & chips) and our bill was just a tad over $10. 

While this is definitely not my favorite Subway, the plus side is - they're next door to Starbucks (which does have a drive-thru)."}
{"text":"Best subway bread I've ever had.  Order a 12 inch but ask for it to be toasted like a 6 inch.  Service was great.  Food was awseome.  Thanks from a Mississippi tourist!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience.  The staff is friendly and hard working.  The store is one of the cleanest in town.  $5 Foot long sandwiches are great for a inexpensive lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Subway is Subway. Like the 1st review said, the only time it's bad is when the bread is stale or old meat. This particular Subway is batting 1.000 so far. Plus, it's right next to my work."}
{"text":"Subway is anything if not consistent. I usually grease it up at Chico's Tacos next door, but sometimes I make a more concerted effort to be healthy. Subway fits that bill. This one, like all the food places in this strip is pretty consistently busy, but they move you through pretty quick. And for the love of God people, pick what you want before you get in line! /end rant"}
{"text":"I've written probably 5 reviews on 5 different Subways, and they are all pretty much the same. That's a good thing."}
{"text":"I hate the west side. Sorry west siders. That being said, I give every west side place a fair chance. This Subway had workers that were clearly not excited to be there. I understand you work at Subway, and that it's kind of a thankless job sometimes but c'mon."}
{"text":"It's Subway. This one is good, clean, etc. Make sure you say a lot or a little mustard if you get it, otherwise it will be a LOT."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times in 2 days been treated horrible.  Pass on this place & how they operate.
1- They refused to honor their $1 off coupon on 2 occasions, then refused another coupon after they made the sandwich they said was good.   Complete morons and horrible service and treatment.  They switch to spanish and knew they were being even more rude."}
{"text":"Great food.
Fresh veggies.
Quick and friendly service.
Good prices. 
Seating areas could be cleaner though, especially since the place was empty when we walked in. 

Will probably be back."}
{"text":"I love subway and I go to a lot of them! The reason I keep going to this one is because of one exceptional worker and I think his name is Thomas. He is such a hardworking kid, and always has a great attitude. He is always joking and in a good mood. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't come here!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here all the time. Fast food place that is healthy.  They are also very fast when preparing your food. The price for a meal is acceptable.  The staff I'd also very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place, great customer service right when I walk in the door, very helpful with suggestions ect will come back time and time again!!"}
{"text":"0 stars if i could. Worst customer service. Never been to this subway til today after my daughter's dance class and it definitely lacked cs.  To the two girls working the 6pm shift if you don't like your job work somewhere else or suck it up.  Management needs to instill proper customer service upon training.  We barely ordered our food and their attitude and tone was rude already.  How would they feel if they received service like that! Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  I walked in to an empty place and still no one greeted me, not the little boy behind the counter or the mgr who was sitting at a table and never looked up! The little boy just stared at me silently till I told him what I wanted, he made my food in silence, never asking if I wanted anything else.  He then kind of gently tossed the food to the area where you pay, and walked away, without a word! Then a girl asked up and asked me what I ordered, took my card and asked if I wanted a recpt, not another word was uttered, she didnt even ask if I wanted a bag. Then I left and ate the food that the cheese wasn't even melted on."}
{"text":"I have vowed never to go to this Subway again.  First, my fiancé asked for a roast beef sandwich. \"Is it ok if I give you the scrap pieces of roast beef? Otherwise we have to throw them away. I'll hook you up with extra meat for free.\" ... \"Uh, ok, I guess.\" (Note: the meat looked like slivers of beef jerky, and he absolutely did NOT get hooked up with extra meat. If anything, he got about half of the meat he should've). Flash forward one minute to the topping station. \"Can I get just the tiniest bit of mayo?\"... *dude squeezes the mayo bottle, which is clearly clogged, until a waterfall of mayo cascades on top of the bed of lettuce and tomato* He then proceeds, instead of maybe scarping the gigantic glob off, or even making a new sandwich, to spread what looked like a gallon of mayonnaise all over the sandwich. Flash forward to the cash register. Transaction complete. \"Oh, if you would've gotten a footlong instead of a 6 inch, you would've saved a dollar\" Good information to know now that I've already had you make our sandwiches and paid you... you couldn't have informed me of that at the beginning? Clearly incompetent people. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to make a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Was just in this subway and they ladies behind the counter were overly rude and slower than ever! 
What should've taken 10 minutes at most took 25 minutes. 
Call this fast food? More like slow and rude food!
On top of that my sandwich is so overly toasted I can't actually bite into it."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Forgot to put chicken in my sub and when I returned asking for a refund they refused. Extremely rude, do not go to this location unless you're looking for bad customer service with your meatless sandwich."}
{"text":"I live in the Providence area and once in a while I get in the mood for a sandwhich. Saves me a trip to far from the house. The staff was great...super friendly and made a great sandwhich. I know it's Subway but it wasn't overloaded to where all the toppings where falling out. Just have to say love the location."}
{"text":"The emeployies where rude and didn't understand what my wife and I wanted we had to explain it several times and the lobby was dirty the thrash was overflowing"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst Subway I have ever been in. The food was horrible to begin with! The people that work here are the rudest people I have ever encountered, the cashier literally was screaming at us in front of other costumers. I emailed corporate to tell them the full story and no one has even bothered to contact me back. Ridiculous don't waste your money to be abused by these people all for some nasty food."}
{"text":"Horrible. They literally made my sandwich and then the girl walked to the back and never checked me out. I sat up at the register for at least 5 minutes while my sandwich got soggy and gross. The girl who made it never checked me out she made me wait until everyone after my sandwich was made and other girl could check me out. They were vey unprofessional and need to get it together."}
{"text":"Assistant Manager Janice is the best! Always in a good mood, smiling and greets EVERY customer when they walk in. She is the reason we keep coming back to this location."}
{"text":"ok, I have tried the website,completed the survey, very conscientously I might add,then at the end some dumb glitch won't take it! Could they be screening out the \"negative\" remarks? Well, I went in to the Subway at 8877 N. 107th Ave in Peoria AZ for lunch. Had coupon,got my sandwich,filled my drink cup. Went out to the car to eat. Came back in for refill of tea, to which a young male employee says to me, \"That will be $1\".  I says \"Oh you charge for refills now?\" He says,\"I was just told it would be $1\". Embarrassed!!Gave him back his cup of tea&got the h$%%# out of there!Called mgr later who was apologetic, saying no we don't charge for refills if you haven't left the property. She said \"Come in and we will buy you a meal.\" I thought cool! But haven't been back. IDK, just not worth taking the chance that overzealous dude would do same thing. They can keep their comp meal. Too bad - I liked Subway. Now I don't want to go to any."}
{"text":"Never again. 2 guys working on Monday 11/3/14 around 230pm were talking about my wife's \"big titties.\" The bread was hard like croutons & deserves a refund. Been here before with a couple of younger teenage boys & the service & food was great."}
{"text":"I eat at this subway at least once a weak during normal lunch hours.  The employees are very friendly.  The sandwiches are consistent with other Subway restaurants and taste fresh.

It can get busy at times and the line gets long. But that happens at most subways I'm aware of.  It is kept clean."}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favor and dont eat here. 2 of my friends got food poisoning here, violent vomitting and diarrhea for 3 days straight. They did nothing to correct the issue, and I doubt they have updated their health standards. Just an aweful place with rotten food. Wish I could give no stars."}
{"text":"I asked for a 6\" sandwich today and they pulled out a piece of bread that looked maybe 4\"... I decided I'm not going to pay for a small sandwich I can make at home. I requested they make it into a footlong so it is at least worth my money, they pulled out another half of a sandwich, made them separately, provided me  with more attitude than my 3 year old does on a daily, and tried to charge me for two 6\" sandwiches. I certainly wouldn't suggest coming to this subway."}
{"text":"This location is the cleanest, and the most friendliest! I would highly recommend coming to this location and the workers are super great!! Especially one of the workers named Angel!! :-)"}
{"text":"Attempted to order a breakfast sub off the menu. The worker grabbed the flat bread. I again asked for the sub and pointed on the menu where it was and what I wanted. Again he grabbed the flat bread. I tried still a third time that I wanted a sub and he rhetorically said you you want the flat bread. I proceeded to walk out and grab breakfast elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had walked into Subway because at my daughters school it was a parent and child lunch. My daughter wanted a kids meal with sweet onion chicken. I finish getting both me and my daughters sandwiches, I look at the total price of our sandwiches and it came out to 14 dollars?!?! My sandwich was only 4 dollars and the kids meal was 4 dollars!!! They charged me for separate Juice box, chips, extra 2 dollars for chicken! I thought they would be nice enough for replace the other item for the ones I was charged for? Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the girls blew me away with how nice and on top of things they were. Not that anyone is going to honestly read a review before getting Subway or not, but I just left and Ashley could not have been a better representative of Subway. Fast service, super nice and polite, and full of energy. Thx"}
{"text":"My local Subway that I've been visiting for years. Fast friendly service, clean, great for quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is the worst subway I have ever gone to. This service was horrible and when I got home to eat my sub and cookies, I opened my cookie bag to find a bite taken out of one of them. I will NEVER go back there. I will tell people about my negative experience here."}
{"text":"A Subway is a Subway, but this one is always spotless clean and it has a drive-thru. The workers are efficient and friendly which are ideal when time is short."}
{"text":"Great customer service! The owner is always so friendly and his current staff is also. They go above and beyond to satisfy the customer. The food is okay like the rest of the subways. I haven't seen them make any mistakes as far as handling food. By far the friendliest subway I have ever been too."}
{"text":"Kathleen is The reason I like Subway! She is courteous,  hard working and very engaging. The service here is better than the surrounding dine in eateries. I am glad you guys are here!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning once after eating a sandwich from this subway.
Worst 3 days of my life. And it was a weekend! I ended up spending my weekend between my bed and my toilet"}
{"text":"I was in there yesterday prior to work and as I looked down In the food assembly area I viewed a like cockroach.  Needless to say I didn't pay for the sub because my appetite was diminished at that point.  Perhaps they can take a more proactive approach and have a licensed pest control company spray more often.  A time before this incident saw a live  fly in the work station before he landed on the food prep area."}
{"text":"They guys greeted us when walking in and we're very patient  with my girls since they didn't know what they wanted.  They were not skimp on the veggies n the perfect amount of oil n vinegar."}
{"text":"I come.here at least once.a.week for my mom, I moved from.new york and found this place to be pretty amazing everyone is polite. The manager is so cool n down to earth n the at manager. A lay with dark blind hair usually working v the veggies n register had exceptional customer service. I def tell.everyone to check this place out"}
{"text":"Went to the subway at 11:30 pm and they said they were closed though the sign said they are open till 12:00 am. We entered the restaurant and the server that was there signaled to us that they were closed by waving his hand across his throat. No 'i'm sorry we're closed'. Nothing. Terrible service without getting any service. Will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"Very good service. I come into this subway often because it's close to home. This location is usually clean and the staff is pleasant."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Usually my subway experience is more than satisfying, but not this time. The manager, Karla was very rude and short, my veggies were not fresh & she seemed to be so distracted she couldn't even focus on making my sandwich correctly. This was by far the worst subway experience I've had. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I love subway, but some locations are a hit or a miss. The staff is friendly and nice, but they skimp on the veggies and the spinach is usually bad or spoiled, it looks black and unappetizing. This is a miss..."}
{"text":"This place is hopping during the lunch time (11-1), and they are always super fast despite the line circling the lobby! Typical Subway otherwise with friendly staff and good food."}
{"text":"Those 2 girls working there on Saturday August 27th, 2016 need to be retrained or fired. No idea how they are working there. When we ask for extra olive and pickles we DONT mean FOUR. Then when we ask for more they add 3 more. A guy who works there during weekdays early morning makes them amazing but not these two. Specifically the blonde one. Cannot be called a sandwich artist."}
{"text":"A very busy lunch time location. Veggies aren't always the freshest here. They serve old bread. Good customer service is hit and miss. They definitely need to give this location some TLC."}
{"text":"I ordered a foot long turkey on Italian bread with all veggies minus the pickles and olives. How hard is that? I was given my sub with hard bread and olives and pickles on it. I politely told her. She asked me if I wanted her to take them off. Really?! Okay I could just take them off; that's not the point. She didn't offer to remake it. Needless to say I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I've been to many subways in my travels, this one was one of the worst I've ever visited.

Apparently their portions of cheese on a footlong is by their definition \"a pinch\". Ordered a Meatball Sub with Shredded cheese, there was barely any cheese on the darn thing (Seems like an obvious ploy to get people to pay for the extra cheese, but having visited other subways, this was painfully obvious what they were pulling!)

Oddly they didn't have any spinach as a choice of topping either, \"too expensive\" they claimed. Sheesh. I could have forgiven that if the only greens you could choose from didn't taste like it hadn't been washed! The lettuce they use just tastes disgusting!

I will be slightly positive, there is one male staff member there that is actually friendly and will greet you warmly, however the others just treat you with indifference and appear to don't actually listen to your order (A simple meatball sub I had to correct them numerous times on what I want in it. And I may be a Brit, but my accent isn't difficult to comprehend I should hope!)

It's a shame. I love my Spinach, Shredded Cheese and Min... err. Ground Beef (Wrong country there again!) sammichs! I'll be giving this place a miss and going to the nearby Safeway's Deli counter or Richmond's Pub instead for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Yeh I must not have caught the team on a good night cause they were mean. I'm not gonna go into detail but I will never return their again. And Annie or Andrea whichever one is her name I'm not sure, she should be fired. She has some problems and she needs to learn to not bring them into work with her. Oh and the issue had to relate to her forcing me out pretty much and threatening to call the cops on me right at 9pm most likely due to some personal issues of her own and needing to be out ASAP which being mean to someone and threatening to call the police on them isn't a way to handle that if you ask me. And I'm a nice guy and did nothing to deserve the kind of treatment she gave me. Here is what is written right on the subway workers manuel to that I found online, \"- Employees must be willing to stay past their scheduled time at times when the store does happen to get busy\", and \"All customers must be greeted with a \"Welcome to Subway\" greeting as they walk through the door. Customers must be treated in a professional manner, be patient with customers, even if they are giving you trouble. Last but not least, remember that the customer is always right. She did say Welcome to subway, but that is about it."}
{"text":"I usually love subway, but this location it not the same.  Having to ask for a topping four times is ridiculous.   it wasn't just me either, I noticed almost everyone in line doing the same.  I can only assume the ones that didn't were too shy.  this has happened on all 4 of my visits.  I would suggest choosing a different location where there is not shortage on all vegetables."}
{"text":"There are many reasons why subway is the best restaurant on ASU campus. Firstly, in my opinion, the quality of food at subway is great. For instance, it is tasty and delicious. Also, food at subway is healthy because it has low calories. In addition, I think subway is convenient for students because it is on campus. For instance, subway is at the MU. Thirdly, in my opinion, the quality of service at subway is high. For example, the workers there are friendly. Fourthly, I think the price range is low for students at subway. Finally, in my point of view, subway a is really good restaurant because we can eat healthy food at subway. To sum up, for these reason, I believe that subway is the best restaurant on ASU campus."}
{"text":"We walked in after the lunch crowd.  It was around 2:00.  There was nobody in the restaurant so we figured we would get food quickly.  Turns out there was only one employee working and she was fixing loaves of bread to put in the oven.  She said she would help us but when she finished putting cheese on top of the loaves and getting them in the oven she grabbed another tray of bread to put cheese on top of those loaves instead of helping us.  We looked at each other, laughed, and walked out.  We found another restaurant nearby and at there instead."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for ZERO stars because that is what I would rate this Subway location. Their bread was not fresh - somehow it was a combination of stale and undercooked. Lettuce had a brownish tinge, indicating it was turning. Staff didn't even know how to cut open the bread well. And to top it all off, their prices are much higher than other subway locations less than 5 miles away. Do yourself a favor, take those extra 5-6 minutes to go to another location. This one is terrible!"}
{"text":"Dont go to subway often so i don't really know whats good, but the worker Alejandro did a good job giving me options, i appreciate it and i will be back, thank you."}
{"text":"If you like water with your meal, you'll have to pay for a drink. I don't mind paying 25¢ or so for a cup but to have to pay for a drink to get tap water is a huge annoyance and a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"We are normally satisfied with our food and customer service, but today was not the case. Jenny, with the blue hair, was our sandwich artist and she was less than friendly, unprofessional and overly stingy with the portions. There is a scoop portion controller for a reason and she didn't even fill up the scoop."}
{"text":"I eat there yesterday with my daughter in between 2:30 & 3:00. Terrible service & the girl behind the counter had major attitude!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Subway in the state. I have given this location many chances and every time something odd always happens. My very first time visiting this location a kid helped me I am 99% sure he was on some kind of drug (not saying illegal) it took him 15 minutes to put together my sub then the second time they had no boxes for the flatizas so the girl refused to sell them to me. Lastly during my last visit I asked for a flatiza a guy was making it and then he coughed all over it. Didn't wash his hands nor did he attempt not to cough all over the veggie bar. Nasty! Management needs to fix a couple thing here! I will always drive down to Loose and Centennial even though I love 2 seconds away from this location. Oh well."}
{"text":"Best location in Vegas they are always friendly and fast. There tends to always be a line but that is for a good reason! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Never had an issue here
Always great fast service
Most employees will repeat back to you what you asked for to make sure its correct

This subway does have a drive thru, but I personally wouldn't use it...too much room for error with it being along side the busy highway"}
{"text":"Busy location. Food is always fresh. Pretty good customer service. Parking is difficult given the business lot and location of the store"}
{"text":"I took my 3 kids for a late lunch (around 4 PM) on our school holiday break.  The two male employees were restocking the food and condiments.  No one greeted us, in fact it took a minute for them to stop what they were doing to wait on us.  

My sons shared a 12\" meatball sub, my daughter had the kids sandwich and I had the $3 roasted chicken.  After the boys made our sandwiches, the female manager appeared from the back room.   She was pleasant.  The staff all seemed bumbed out to be at work.   All the food was to our liking."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8pm. Empty. Completely empty. But boy, was this place clean & put together. Cleanest, tidiest Subway I've EVER been in.

I looked around to see if anyone was there & wondered first if they were open, then if anyone was even in the shop because it was so quiet. My last thought was if a robbery was in progress & if I should get while the getting was good!!  At which point someone came out from the back. 

OMG!  The prep area was clean!! All the containers were properly filled, nice & neat. Not a crumb or lost lettuce shaving to be seen.  Chips were displayed upright & properly stocked. Not a crinkled bag in sight. 

I'm not sure what was going on noise wise (there was none) behind the counter but I was constantly repeating myself as was the Subway person. Maybe its the design of the counter?  I dunno really, just something I've noticed at every Subway I've been to: no one seems to be able to hear each other. 

I still can't believe how clean it was!!

I asked for a toasted Chicken Bacon ranch sammie with provolone. Having a fried pickle craving, I also asked for \"lots of pickles.\"  Got 'em!  My sammie quickly came to life before my eyes & it looked amazing. I was so hungry I couldn't wait to get home & devour this culinary masterpiece. 

ALL the tables were wiped down!!

Unfortunately, even toasted, my sammie was cold. Specifically, the chicken. Honestly I didn't notice if Chef Mike warmed the chicken prior to it going on the bread or not, but its the only reason I can think as to why my sammie was cold. 

The drinks station was immaculate. Not a single stray straw wrapper. Anywhere!  The bit where the soda comes out WAS CLEAN!  good thing I went for the tea. 

Because of the Chef Mike oversight I gave a 4-star because this by far is the cleanest restaurant (fast food or not) I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Janice has a HORRIBLE attitude. I asked her a question and she immediately got smart with me and threw her hands up!! While making my sandwich she decided to stop and do a hundred other things like my time wasn't important!! She should consider a different job since her customer service skills suck!! Maybe something behind a glass or over the phone"}
{"text":"This subway will try to rip you off $2-3 per transaction if you're not paying attention."}
{"text":"This review is for their new product only!! The Flattizza. Wow, this thing is horrible.

 Contrary to popular belief, every restaurant, food stand, food truck, diner, hole in the wall dive bar, does not, I repeat, DOES NOT need to try to make pizza. Stick with a pizza joint. If you want a sub go to Subway. I love their subs! They're tasty and pretty cheap. This Subway only has 2 workers in at all times and they get very busy at times. These so-called pizzas are labor intensive and not worth the effort. You're better off buying a frozen pizza and cooking it your self. They take a flatbread and cut it in half, then toast it. They pull it out and put on tasteless pizza sauce, then top it with a miniscule amount of pepperoni and cheese. Then they toss it back in the toaster. Depending on how long they leave it in there, it will either be almost burnt or very soggy. By the time my 4 flattizzas were ready there was a line of customers behing me.

 Another thing they need to drop are those chopped salads. These things take 3 years to make!!
Bottom line: 2 for 5 bucks!? Still not worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't know what passes for service at this store, but if it's the same thing I experienced last week...well, I would hate to see what constitutes as \"courteous treatment\" on a good day. The person who made my sandwich (Jan, Jen, I don't know. She was nowhere near courteous enough to treat me with respect, so why should I?) was rude, impatient, and generally unpleasant. She rolled her eyes several times when my son, who has special needs, was having a bit of difficulty in deciding what he wanted on his sandwich.

I was hoping that I wouldn't have to deal with this unpleasant worker all the way until checkout, a wish that was almost granted; as there were two other workers (a guy with colored hair and someone taller.) Unfortunately for myself and my son, however, the other two workers walked into the store's backroom and left us with the disrespectful sandwich artist. My son has an allergy to tomatoes, and I reminded her several times of this, but, admittedly, did not double check while she was making the food. She proceeded to be rude till checkout, and we left in a huff before I could yell. When I got home, I inspected the sandwich and found five tomatoes! Worst experience, and implore others not to visit this store. One star."}
{"text":"I'm hoping I can give this place no stars as I start to write this but if I can't, you'll see one star and know that I would have given it none if I'd been allowed.

Like Tara S. (who I do not know), this is by far the worst Subway I've ever been in (although I've only been in maybe ten of them in my entire life).  I come to Cleveland frequently for business and don't stay far from the restaurant so I've been there twice in the last five weeks.  The first time, the only employee in the location snarled at me and the other customer who was in there.  Clearly, we were interrupting whatever he was doing.  The other customer and I were both treated rudely.

Today, I went in and was waited on by a different employee.  She also appeared to have other things she would rather be doing.  No smile, no hello, no nothing...just asked what I wanted.  In fairness to her (though it may only be because I complimented her on her hair), when she went to put the meat on my sandwich she apparently felt like the little paper tray holding the meat didn't have as much as it should have so she chose a different tray.  Thank you, sullen girl.  I also asked for a cookie and when she removed it from the case, a very small piece of it broke off so she started to grab me a different one.  I appreciated that, but told her I'd take the one she already had.  She then rang me up, asked me if I wanted my receipt and after I said no, she turned and walked away.  No thank you, no goodbye, no have a nice day, nothing.  I wasn't even sure my credit card worked...thought maybe she was off to call the police so I grabbed my food and walked out.

My card worked.  It was just an illustration :)

I also like the food for the most part.  Just the same, there is no way I will go back in that place.  I give everybody credit if they try, but both employees at this store failed to try AT ALL to make me want to come back ever again...really made it pretty clear they didn't want anyone in there in the first place.  I can't imagine how this store stays in business.

Shoot.  Sure enough, I had to give it one star.  Yelp owes me a star."}

{"text":"Four stars really?  it is fast food thousands of the same all over the country.  yes they make a quick decent sandwich but I wont give it four stars.. I wont go into detail on all the different sandwiches I have tried there I think 99% of the population knows what it tastes like already.  good for a quick cheap meal but not 4 star good.."}
{"text":"I visited this subway last night just after 8pm. The sandwich artist behind the counter was almost non verbal but made it known he wanted out of there ASAP. Closing hours were 9:30pm. When paying  I had to sign the receipt but since he didn't have a pen said I could use my finger nail it's the same thing. Then went to fill my drink and there was no iced tea. Asked the sandwich artist and his reply was they don't leave tea out more than 4 hours. \"What the\". Really if you want iced tea you have to come before 8 pm? The whole attitude of these kids if awful. Your are definitely unwelcome there. Bad experience."}

{"text":"Great Convenient location. The staff is so friendly and they always have a suggestion if you need help. It's also very clean. Free internet and a big TV makes it a great stop for lunch."}
{"text":"I got the meatball 12\" sandwhich for $6.79+tax. Gave me less tomato for some reasons, cheap guy. Brought it home and everything fell apart."}
{"text":"Clean and fast. Your average subway restaurant. Considering it's in a busy place, I have never had to wait too long to get my food. They also made my sandwich according to my bizarre requests without complaining :)"}
{"text":"Amazing morning staff aftera morning jog with kid. There was no coffee made yet and the staff jumped in a made me one. Stephenie and Benjamin are a great time and i highly recommend them. What a way to start the day. My coffee was brought out to me. Wow customer service at the finest."}

{"text":"Service is consistent. Team is fast and courteous. Food is generally fresh. I am always disappointed with subway in general because of thier cheap portions.  But hey I get it.  This is by far one of the better subways in the valley."}
{"text":"The service is sad. If you are going to offer drive thru then be consistant. Waiting for 10 minutes in line and without moving is not drive thru. So I forbid to give my money to a company that does not provide good service. So I pull around the car in front of me and talk to the guy in drive thru saying they need to speed up their drive thru process, which he proceeds to tell me is slow because they have allot of people inside and rolls his eyes at me. Really, that's the excuse?? Then don't offer the service if you can't manage the business or staff properly. Will not go back. Train staff properly."}
{"text":"Drive through takes FOREVER.  I'm sitting here right now. It's been about 15 min already. They get on the speaker and the first thing they say is hold on, we need to help customers inside first. I'm 99% sure I've been waiting longer than the people inside. What's the point of a drive through if it's 10x faster to just go inside??"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would.   Went in around 6:30pm, and waited patiently while a very slow moving employee finished doing his \"chores\" and was barely acknowledged.   Next, order a meatball sub.... was told they were out of meatballs.... next tried ordering pizza....nope!...told me they were out of pizza.   Ordered two other sandwiches.   Asked for brown mustard (which I get at least once a week at a subway).... instead my sandwich was slathered with honey mustard.   When I objected, I was given a \"so what?\" stare by the employee.   The employee proceeded to tell me that they have never had brown mustard and honey mustard was the closest thing (defined inaccurate).  She then proceeded to pick my meat off and tried to scrape it off (not working) instead of starting over.   I finally gave up on these clowns, paid for my stuff, and got out of there before I got angry and made a scene..... Terrible customer service and poorly managed"}
{"text":"there was a slimy thing on the drink and I informed the staff and guess what,  she was so rude and did not bother to clean the drink dispenser.  I won't recommend this location and will never go back."}
{"text":"Two workers...one with headphones in his ears and didn't even hear me when I asked him a question. The other was almost rude and threw the sandwiches together with the care of a warthog slinging trough food. Food prep seemed to lack a basic amount of hygenic consciouness and thought for a sandwich that would at least not fall apart upon unwrapping. Bad show!"}
{"text":"I go to this place several times during the week.  The girls know me and my order.  Great location."}
{"text":"Had a good visit, fast service food was good and looked fresh, I feel that if the staff was a little more friendly and outgoing it would take the visit from good to great. Big picture- better than most subways I have been to, I will be returning!"}

{"text":"This is the closest subway to my work. Its clean and convenient.  Eat Fresh!"}
{"text":"The owner Scott is the rudest person I've met in a long time I have called and complained on him and I think anyone else who witnesses his behavior would do the same. I am determined to make this man understand that the way he is running this business is not sufficient. Scott seems to be an unhappy miserable person who treats his employees like crap! Scott has no respect for himself his business the subway franchise his employees or his customers. Save yourself the trouble and just go to another subway the food is pretty much the same."}
{"text":"Wow first one star.

This rating is for the service, not the food.  According to James Blake, Subway tastes the same in Shanghai, New York and London.

Although most people dont like their jobs, the ladies that work at this particular location really really hate theirs. The sandwiches are sloppy, little to no eye contact, and not one single smile. I'm not saying I want Mrs Personality making my food, but if I wanted to order through a robot I would have gone to Arbys (some of them now have automated ordering machines, they look like ATM's and you can customize your orders, pay, and just wait for your number to be called) 

And something else. The stupid 5 dollar foot long song. Seriously, I HATE IT!"}
{"text":"This is the best subway I've been to because of the great service! !!!! I pass three others on my way home and this is the one I will always go to. ... I'm tired at the end of my day and it is nice to have fast professional service.  Apparently one employee has been there for 12 years and for all the time I've been going here he is always very fast and courteous. ... thanks!"}
{"text":"I eat at this Subway a minimum of 4 times a week (I wish I was kidding). Compared to other Subways, they are pretty consistently good.  Their tomatoes are usually red and they are good at picking the seeds out of the hot peppers.  However, if you get a fountain drink, double-check the ice that comes out of the ice-dispenser; it tends to have little black flecks in it.

About 1/2 the employees know how to correctly align the triangular cheese slices too, so that's well above the Subway corporate standard. 

When the owners work the cash, their extremely long fingernails kinda freak me out.  They also seem like pricks, but the rest of the staff is really nice. One server even slides me an extra cookie sometimes.

The fresh bread comes out of oven at 12:15 on Sundays and 11:15 other days. The ovens make the place hot as hell, but it's worth it for that bread.  Their chocolate chip distribution on their cookies is also excellent."}
{"text":"This place was super dirty. The toilets were clogged. The service sucked. I had a tune sandwich and it looked like crap. They got lazy and started doing a guacamole instead of just cutting up the avocado and putting pieces on the subs."}
{"text":"I love Subway so don't think this is a knock against Subway sandwiches, this is a knock against THIS Subway.  I used to eat at Subway 3 times a week and since I moved to Southern Highlands and this is really the only Subway near me, I don't bother very often.  

I have never, not once, gone into this store and gotten what I wanted.  Every single time they are out of the cheese, or my favorite drink, or the bread I like, or green peppers, or whatever I want.   I have asked why they always run out of things, and half the time I am sure it is because this store is run by teenagers who don't care.  Twice out of the past 3 times I have had to wait for someone to go find tops for the drinks.  I can't drive home without one.  Is it such a surprise that you have to fill up supplies?  Why should I have to stand there for 10 minutes while you search the store to see if you have any?  

One night they told me there was no cheese...not because the store didn't have any, but because \"the other shift didn't fill the trays with cheese and it's not our job.\"  I suspect that is the case with all the products.  I walked out that night.  I had 6 people to fulfill orders for and guess what?  They all wanted cheese.   Who runs out of diet coke?  Raspberry drink?  Minute maid lemonade?   And all at once?  Heavens folks!  All you do is sell drinks and sandwiches, make sure you have these things to sell!  

Well, it's not my job to do their job.  I sure hope the owner of this place sees this review.  This store is the poorest run Subway I have ever seen.  You cannot leave a business in the hands of \"it's not my job\" teenagers.  

If this had happened once...ok...twice...not so great...but 6 out of 6 times in the past 6 months.  I have never walked out of that store happy.  Luckily, the supermarket is next door and guess what?  They carry food too!

Update:  6/23/12   They are batting 1000.  Once again, they were unable to make a sandwich because they didn't have the ingredients.  The excuse....we were busy and it will take a while to make more.  Worse, I was told the aforementioned with a whiny complaint as if to say....what do you want?  Food?  Why should we have food?  If we are busy you should accommodate US and change your order to whatever we do happen to have on hand.  

Again...no adult in sight.  Just children running the store on their time not giving a whit about customers.   Perhaps this store is owned by a 15 year old?"}
{"text":"Music playing super loud.... i couldn't hear him he couldn't hear me i kept having to repeat myself and try to speak over the music. Its a sub shop not the club."}
{"text":"Stopped in this location after realizing how late it was and that everywhere else around me was just about closing.   We were promptly greeted by a gentleman named AJ.  I must say that I'm completely compelled to write this review based on the customer service we were given by him!!! It had to of been around midnight and he was so upbeat and positive!  Just an absolute pleasure to be speaking with.  As for the facility itself - very clean, with fresh ingredients ( I always check the tomatoes) youd be surprised by how many places look like theyve been cut days before!  Yuck, who wants a slimey tomatoe.  Anyhew, if you need something late night to eat and dont feel like eating a million fast food calories, choose this place!"}
{"text":"Please stop here if you want to be dissapointed with the service. This one store put a bad taste in my mouth..literally. After trying them for the first time and utilizing the drive-thru for the first time at a Subway it was a total disaster. The \"sandwich specialist\" took my order but failed to get my entire order and gave me a piece of bread and a couple slices of meat. She took my money shut the door and left me out there with my sad sandwich. I honked. I called the store and asked for the manager. I was in rage. So save your self and just eat your homemade pbj."}
{"text":"Worst service ever in my life. Employees are under the influence while working. Today I had my friend go to subway and I wrote down what I wanted on a piece of paper...the subway worker messed my order up TWICE on a simple order. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Joseph was very friendly and made us feel welcome. Definitely made this visit a great dining experience! Will be coming back and recommending this place to friends. I don't usually give reviews unless I have a great time or someone is exceptionally memorable and Joseph most definitely is."}
{"text":"Never having the female make my sandwich again.... She made my sandwich I said mustard, oil and oregano... She put vinegar in it and I said I didn't want vinegar.... She just looked at me and I told her I can't have vinegar so she made it again.... When we got to the end part I said \"ok... Mustard, oil and oregano...\" She puts mustard, pepper and i tell her \"I said oregano\" and she said \"that's oregano\" and I point at the oregano and I ask \"what's this?\" And the guy passing by says \"that's oregano\" and I tell her I said I wanted oregano not pepper and she makes a noise indicating she's annoyed when clearly I should be the one irritated, and I am, so I just say just add oregano.... And I got home to find she didn't even cut it!!! (Kind of mad, to be honest)
I haven't had a problem with this location til now... But I won't stop coming, just won't have the female make it."}

{"text":"By far my most favorite Subway. The AM crew is wonderful. Always nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Subway. It delivers what you expect - a quick mediocre sandwich. Good if you need to not starve, but not \"good\"."}
{"text":"This subway has gone downhill!! Recently I've gone in and saw the bread I requested with mold on it! Server had it right on the prep table. Luckily she threw it away but replaced it with another from same area!! Manager was right there the whole time and said nothing. Not sanitary or safe for customers."}
{"text":"I stop here on my way home at least three times a week, sometimes four. Tonight, I went in at 9:30 PM and they close at 10 PM. As soon as I walked in the door, the two workers there immediately put up their hands and yelled, \"We're closed!\" Really? Thirty minutes before you are supposed to be? Okay.Then  I guess I don't need to keep eating there three to four times a week if you can't take five minutes to make me a lousy sandwich."}
{"text":"Clean and Eugenia was very nice. They were out of grilled chicken but there plenty of sandwiches to choose from. No complaints from me. \"No work trucks in parking lot\""}
{"text":"Terrible.  In a break in between class I decide to eat at this establishment.  As I was trying to order the whole staff is chit chatting with each other.  TRYING to order was even more fun.  I told the guy three times that I wanted a six inch subway club but he kept on talking.  So he pulls out a foot long bread and rudely asks me what I  wanted in my sandwich.  I said pepper jack and he said NO what sandwich you want?!?!?!?!  So then as he's beginning to put it together he hands it off to his equally lazy coworker and takes off in the back.  Paying for it was it....EXCEPT after the girl took my money she took off forgetting to give me my sandwich so I reached over and grabbed it.  I will NEVER go back to this place again!"}
{"text":"The service is horrible!! This girl kyra !!! Dont have manners!! Never recoment this subway!! I hope she gets fired!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Breakfast Flat Bread Sandwich with Egg, cheese, and bacon.  I got the combo with a coffee for 3 bucks before tax.  It was a great value if you were to ask me.  I of course added chipotle sauce which is what keeps me going back to Subway.  The sandwich was tasty for breakfast and something out of the ordinary.  The only thing that I would recommend is to have the flat bread toasted instead of microwaved since the bread is a little soft for a breakfast sandwich.  If they were to figure a way to get that done it would have been an outstanding treat.  If you are out for a cheaper breakfast I wouldn't discount Subway as a potential choice with these breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm a restaurant manager and there are a few things I expect when I go out to eat.  Number one is cleanliness.  The two ladies working on 3/8/16 at 10:45 am both handled my sandwich, then grabbed the ringing store phone to answer a call, and went back to working on my food with the same gloved hands the entire time.  Don't they know that phones are the most disgusting thing to touch?
Second, I watched one drop a slice of provolone cheese into the \"scupper\"? Where they brush the random food particles that fall, then put it right back in the cheese bin for later use.
Lastly, customer service.  Another customer came in to pick up an online order.  The lady behind the counter said nothing had come through the system and stood there looking dumbfounded instead of making even the slightest attempt to resolve the issue.
Needless to say, I will walk out again if I see either of these two ladies working here again."}
{"text":"It's a Subway. Clean, fairly small. Parking in back for free; paid parking on the street. I wish they would move it in a little closer to 10th St though.

Open 0700h to 2200h M-F, 0900h to 2200h Sat & Sun."}
{"text":"This Subway definitely deserves a 5 plus rating. The employees go above and beyond to ensure that each customer leaves happy. Their exceptional customer service was greatly appreciated. As soon as I walked in the door they made me feel extremely welcomed. They all had smiles on their faces which was a nice change to what I usually encounter at other food establishments. I was lucky enough to meet the owner, and he was absolutely phenomenal! He was hands on and worked will his team. You can tell he cares about each and every customer. He treated them like family. He made sure no one left dissatisfied or disappointed. I was so impressed with my experience, I knew I had to write a review to let everyone know about this location. As for the food, it was excellent and the presentation made it more irresistible. My sandwich was great. You can definitely taste the freshness in the veggies and the bread.This is truly what makes a establishment worth coming to. I will never eat at another Subway again!!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE WORST SUBWAY IN FRANCHISE HISTORY!!! This franchise is privately owned by Stacey Provence and Douglas Pasanella, two people that should NEVER be allowed to own a customer service based business! Don't complain about the crappy service or incorrect charges because they will call the police and create accusations and file a false police report against you to avoid refunding you a $4.00 discrepancy or remaking a sandwich to please the customer. Not only will you be denied the proper solution to poor customer service or being overcharged, your bad experience at this Subway may turn into being contacted by the police! The last time I checked, the customer was ALWAYS right! This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!"}
{"text":"Been to this subway a few times.
The place is clean. And the service is good. 
But the issues I have with this location is that they do not offer a restroom at all. 

Most subways I been to offer a restroom.
The issue I had was the lettuce for the last two times I been there looked a little brown."}
{"text":"Got breakfast for the first the at subway.
Ordered the flat bread ham sandwich. 
The service was fast. The taste of sandwich was bland.  The place was clean. 
Would not order the sandwich again."}
{"text":"Usually great, the guy who starts the sandwich decided I didn't matter once he saw a customer he recognized. I ended up being skipped to get the regulars better service. Told the cashier that isn't good service and I probably won't come back. She was polite, apologized offered freebies. I turned them down, hope they learn to treat people with equally good service and respect."}
{"text":"Normally I would give subway a 3 star review. I like subway but there are better sandwich options out there. However, I bumped this one star due to the drive thru here. It is nothing like I have ever experienced. Its a large touchscreen that you use to order whatever you like.  When I mentioned this option to people the first thing they said was, \"well I like extra of this and only a little of that\". You have control over this. You can select extra of this or select less of that. Its amazing. I wish these were installed in more locations and other fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Ugh. Worst sandwich ever! I usually go to this location because the employees are always really friendly and their sandwich artists are just that! Today, however, was an entirely different story. Looks like they've hired some new employees and Luc is anything BUT a sandwich artist! From the way he destroyed the bread to the way he placed the mayo/mustard on top of one another -- DOWN THE CENTER OF THE BREAD, NO LESS -- who does that??!!...someone teach this kid how to make a sandwich!! Also, putting a smile on your face when you're dealing with customers couldn't hurt either! It'll be a while before I go back to this particular location:("}

An a$$ out of me AND u!!! I assume they didn't even make my order. After about fifteen or so I finally(!) See a girl running out from behind a door...well guess what??!!..Again, no acknowledgement, no nothing...well after sitting in your drive thru for twenty five minutes...I'm all set with your \"convenience\"! An easy,  \" I'll be right with you, or I'll get right on that \", would have sufficed. I no longer will patronize your location."}
{"text":"Very slow service, no matter what time of day you go. I thought it would be great to have a subway in town and that has a drive thru however it's not all that it was cracked up to be. I've never had a fast trip in and out of there. A drive throu is supposed to be convenient for people in the go and this once is anything but that, if you'd in a hurry don't go here."}
{"text":"OMG!! I'm ordering a steak & cheese footling. The Chinese lady sneezed into her gloves and continued to put toppings on my sub. I tried telling her 5 times to change her gloves!!! Maybe she didn't speak English?? I was forced to pay and I throw the sub in the garbage!!!"}
{"text":"I came here to buy a subway sandwich two times within the last two weeks and a lady by the name of Clemmi(black heavy set lady who wears patch on her swollen eye) made my sandwich both times. The 1st time i came here, i forgot to add pepperoni on my sandwich and Clemmi got mad and gave me a dirty look and took a deep breath with such a bad attitude(keep in mind she had just closed the lid to the food and was in middle of making my sandwich and it only took her 3seconds to open food cover back up to get out pepperoni because it's on one side and other side of counter top has all the veggies) and paused for 8seconds with attitude before putting pepperoni on sandwich.The 2nd time I came in, the front door was locked and this place is open 24/7 and i had to keep knocking on window to get her attention(she acted like she couldn't see me or hear me knocking at window even though she saw me as i walked to door) so that I can purchase a sandwich. The meat and veggies were very fresh but this time the bread was so stale(I realized it once I got home to eat sandwich) that i had to through away the Subway bread and put my own bread on it. Because of how rude she is, I wont be back."}
{"text":"This place is great and the people working in the morning are always friendly!"}
{"text":"Why is it that a turkey sub and a veggie delight cost the same but the veggie still gets minimal toppings. I feel like I have to beg to get extra lettuce to make it look like a real sandwich. Two stars because of poor sandwich making otherwise I'd give them a three star. Change the business model for the veggie sandwich please Subway."}

She said no and justified that different outlets have different rates...quite bluntly....Then she toasted the flatizzas with cheese and she started to pack em up without even asking me if i need to add any vegetables, which was quite a common sense...when she was trying to put em in boxes, i interrupted and asked her to add some veggies..she posed a grin look..as if i was asking a favor...when i tasted the flatizza it was very hard and had tough time to bite em up..Horrible service..Alyissa you better need some customer service classes...you spoil the brand name.."}
{"text":"I was reading this morning about the interesting composition of Subway breads... things like their nine grain really being essentially white bread, with trace elements of the rest (so it technically can be called 9 grain). Or it containing ammonium sulphate, a nitrogen fertilizer, to fuel the yeast and assist in making the bread appear \"brown \" (reference: Men's Health Magazine, \"Eat this Not That\"). 

All told, it was kind of disturbing, because I do eat at Subway fairly often. Nonetheless, the article made me hungry, so off I went to Subway! 

Well, no Yelp reviews for this location, so let me chime in: 

Located in the upstairs of Mac's (yes, THAT Mac's - \"Crack Corner\"), a couple of tables with a balcony view of the convenience store checkout awaits. 

Subway is pretty much Subway wherever ... some locations are more creative and obscure than others. Some have greener, less ripe tomatoes in the bins. 

But this one? Besides the balcony view, it also has good \"up-sell\" potential. Quicker than they can mumble \"double meat, double cheese?\" under their breath, your price tag may just go way up, if you aren't careful. 

White cheese also must be the cheapest default, as it seems to cause pain when I say \"no, Swiss please.\" 

Upon careful review of the meat options, I opted not to go with the \"grilled chicken.\" What IS up with those \"breasts?\" Clearly reformed chicken slurry, pale and almost quivering under the fluorescent lights. And the \"grill marks\" ... are those painted on at the plant? 

Well, all in all, exactly what I expect from fast food. 

No surprises here. I like the concept of custom ordered food prepared quickly, and I like a big sandwich. So I come back. But it does make me wish for a really good deli nearby, whipping together a fresher, more natural sandwich to go. Or maybe Subway could put that in the suggestion box for me."}
{"text":"I just love going in there always super nice and fast and clean. David always makes my sandwich and always amazing."}
{"text":"Got a quick lunch after a movie in Harbourfront center. its small but very clean and cozy. the food tastes great and it was softer than other subways i go to which is great because often the bread tastes dry. i got the turkey and ham footlong. the staff seems a bit depressed and down but again, you never know what people are going through."}
{"text":"A quick note that the lunch team working here seems to have been together for a long time and are hands down the best Subway staff I have seen anywhere.

Kudos for handling the lunchtime crowd so well for so long."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I cringed when my friends all wanted to come here for lunch today I dragged my feet in there and ordered a turkey sandwich. They must have gotten new employees in there because the women who helped me was very nice and efficient. (Not at all like the ones I had read about) Everyone was pretty happy with their sandwiches. I wouldn't call these the best in Charlotte but pretty average for a Subway. (Hence, the 3 stars)"}
{"text":"I love subway but this review is specifically for the new Panini sandwiches and this particular store. 

I had a Coupon where you buy a drink and get a free panini. I got one of the Chicken Panini Subway has been promoting like crazy lately. 
The Panini had Chicken, Ham, Spinach and Tomato with Honey mustard as the only sauce on it. They don't allow you to do modifications or add extra sauce, you can ask them to skip the ham or sauce if you want. There is no option on the kind of bread you want it on as well. 
The paninis are placed at a price you can get a foot long (sub of the day) at Mr. Sub with all the customizations with the toppings and sauce. 

I have a couple of other coupons but will not use them because these paninis are the worst i have ever had.

The place had three girls and they didn't say a word and were not welcoming. It looked as if they are doing me a favor making the Sandwich."}
{"text":"So I was hanging out at playhouse square and needed lunch, and this place was right next to me. The guys who worked there were really nice, but the food wasn't nearly as nice. I got my food toasted, but the middle wasn't hot. Other than that, the experience was standard."}
{"text":"This location gets no stars.  This place is the worst Subway I have ever been to.  We have given them unknown amounts of chances and every single time we go our food is never right.  They are always running out of bread in the afternoon and its not like its almost time for them to close this is more like 3 or 4 hours before.  I will never ever step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"This is a great location. They are always so friendly and quick and make great sandwiches and salads. Today I got one with a smile! (See photo)."}
{"text":"Good folks running it. Very fast. I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened but the girl who visibly sighs and slumps her shoulders when I walk thru the door is gone.  Everyone now is friendly and quick.  I love going here now.  Good job!!"}
{"text":"24hr Subway w/ no Drive Thru.
You should eat no where else Late at night

Workers are great (including me haha). Come by, I'll be glad to make your sandwich.

We have quick sandwich makers. If you come in when it's slow, you'll be on your way in no time.
**This location does get a steady amount of customers, wait time depends on how fast the customer orders their sandwich ahead of you** (some ppl take FOREVER)

I would not even go to McDonald's that's nearby."}
{"text":"Twice I went to this location. First time they eyed me strangely and didn't say much. But the second time I went in 50 minutes before close and one worker told me they were closed, while the other lazy employee just stared at me in an awkward way as if he didn't know what to say. I found out later they are supposed to close at 10. This was on a Monday. Need some initiative on this team if you could even call it that. Bad."}
{"text":"I love Subway. I eat it at least once a week but this place is starting to make me mad. I live less than 2 blocks away so it's an easy walk for me but I'm starting to reconsider my sandwich choices.
I have eaten the same subway sandwich since I was 13. I am now 25, so for 12 years I've never had an issue until now. I get a 6 inch turkey with cheese lettuce and mayo. That's it!!! The only detail I have for my sandwich is extra lettuce. 
I'm guessing that the Indian guy that's ALWAYS there is owner or at least the manager but I'm also assuming the other people working are his family. I'm making that assumption based on their interactions with each other. These people seem borderline miserable and won't hardly speak to the customers to ensure their sub is being prepared properly. That's cool because, hey, they're working at subway full time and their job is to make sandwiches not give me a phenomenal experience. 
So this is where I have an issue. If I'm not coming to this establishment for the experience then I'm obviously here for a good sandwich. Like I said before my only issue is I want extra lettuce... Maybe even a little bit more than \"extra,\" maybe a lot of lettuce! But I don't get any other vegetables on my sand which so what's wrong with a healthy amount of lettuce?? It doesn't matter whose behind the counter, I run into the same issue every time. I ask for extra they put a normal amount, I ask for a little more and they put about 4 more pieces of shredded lettuce and its almost awkward to ask them 3 or 4 times to put more lettuce on my sub. I do it anyways and get the weirdest vibe from them. Almost like they are actually annoyed that I wanted a lot of lettuce... I guess the next time I want a turkey sandwich I'll walk 10 more feet and just go to 7-11. This place should be renamed from Sub-Way to Sub-Par."}
{"text":"On Wednesday December 2nd 2015, My sister and I went into this subway. I am subways regular customer in the area where I live. I am always polite and everything. When we walked in I asked for 3 6 inch Italian subs. The manager and her employer looked at each other and rolled there eyes. Once they did that I let it go because I was running late. After they pulled out a bread that was burnt and was 3inches long and about 3 inches thick. I was like um my I have another bread please because that's really smart and burnt compared to the others. The employee was like okay and her manager rushed over and was like there the same bread and I was like no they're not, after that I was like this is something I am paying for and I would like a new bread and the MANAGER was like you know what, you can get out of my store, and I was like how are you going to ask me to get out your store when all I asked for was a new bread ? And she was like it doesn't matter get out or I will call the police and I said well call them because I am not leaving because I asked for new bread. And I told her employee \"be honest isn't these two breads two different breads\" and the MANAGER was like no sh don't answer that and help the next customer. I was really upset, I spend about $150 a month at subway. This subway was horrible, and I will never come there again. The manager looked like she didn't even want to be at work, and for her to refuse service, was incredibly rude. There was no sign in the store that said \"rights to refuse service\" I got a look at her name tag and all I seen was Manager on it. She was a older lady with blonde hair. I went to my regular subway and told them about it and they all were disgusted in that. I hope you guys hire better employees. I love subway but didn't love that service . I thought the customer was always right?"}
{"text":"I haven't ate at subway in like 4 years. This place just blew my mind with how great of a sandwich I just had. If I get a sub like that every time I might eat there once a week with the deluxe thing they got going on."}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here! Today my co-worker decided to eat lunch here and as she was biting into her sandwich she see a DEAD fly on her cucumber. Ugh so disgusting."}
{"text":"I usually come to this location cause it's the nearest subway in my area. And I never had any issue ever til awhile ago, I arrive around 2309hrs and I ordered two footlongs teriyaki and the new sandwich turkey avocado. Teriyaki was perfect as always, but the turkey is missing \"avocado\" that was the most important thing on my sandwich the \"AVOCADO\" without it's incomplete, I was so dissapointed. I didn't wanna come back for it and beside I'm already home didn't wanna do another trip just for that , so I decided to call them multiple times to let them know that they messed up my order but no answer. Hopefully next time that do better job!"}
{"text":"It has been good for me it's just that some incompetent employees somehow don't know how to make a fucking tuna and American cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Really?! This is the only subway branch that doesn't have veggie patty! How many times do i have to ask you  guys? Its been 2 years now since i last asked the first time. 2 thumbs down. I would give four but i only have 2 thumbs"}
{"text":"I normally am not one to write into a customer service line, but the experience I had a Subway tonight was unlike anything I've ever experienced at a Subway before. The line was long when I walked in, but that didn't bother me at all. Five minutes into it the lady who I assume manager finally screams to the back to have another employee to come out and help her and her fellow employee. They moved ridiculous slow, go at people sandwiches mixed up, and the toppings bar was disgusting. Subway is my favorite \"fast food\" chain and every store I've been into keeps a nice clean bar. This bar on the other hand was gross. It had toppings thrown EVERYWHERE. Sauce everywhere, and the glass looked sticky and slimmy. Within the 15 mins it took them to make me and other ppl in line a sandwich, they ran out of three items on the bar and then when to the back to attempt to find more. The female employee aka the possible shift manager, was rude beyond belief as she counted the register for closing process while also handling sandwiches. I understand that you have to prepare to close, but is counting the register infont of me and telling me to \"hold on a second\" appropriate? I literally waited three minutes before she rang up my order and the line built up behind me.....all because she was counting the register. Lastly, this is gross, but while making th girl in front of me a sandwich, the male employee that was called from the back proceeded to scratch his bottom with his gloves on.....unbelievable I know."}
{"text":"This subway has got it on lock.  It's the fastest, most consistent subway on campus.   With the line going out around the lobby during lunch, I've still never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes. The efficiency is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Never eat here! I've gotten food-poising from their incorrect food storage and also they were offering a promotion where you pay for 10 sandwiches and you get one free; but the lady said when I tried to claim my free one that the \"promotion did not exist anymore!\" This is horrible business practices."}
{"text":"I called ahead to order a sandwich to be picked up in time for my lunch break, but was told they were \"too busy\" to help me. I guess subway doesn't need my. Business. Ashley did tell me I should have used the app, which I have tried before. Unfortunately the sandwich I like (turkey Italiano)  isn't an option. Nor is there an option to \"make your own\" 

Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Came on the wrong night apparently.  Charged full price for my $6 footlong and didn't realize it until I drove away..."}
{"text":"Tried to serve me a sub out of the trashcan. Really?!!!"}
{"text":"As the worker made my sandwich, I noticed a hair sitting on the turkey. After I pointed it out, they removed it but there was no apology. And I had to ask for them to do something. In the end all they did was remove the meat. Yuck!"}
{"text":"The wife and husband owners are absolutely rude! I am calling corporate to also let them know how bad they treat their customers and \"run\" their business. This location is right next to our home and we rarely go to subway anymore because of how we are treated EVERY time, together or separately. Seriously, it never fails there is always an issue when we go in. The sandwiches are never up to par and they act like they are bothered to make a sandwich. The husband is really odd and the wife is a TOTAL B!TCH! DO NOT GO THERE! They SUCK more than their CRAPPY SANDWICHES. Thank Heaven Kneaders is across the street Much better quality and SUPERIOR Service than THIS CRAPPY SUBWAY! STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"This fucking place es close when it said it was open fix your stupid shit...."}
{"text":"I went into this place on April 25 and they wouldn't honour a coupon I had.  They claim that they don't accept Subway coupons!
I escalated the issue to Subway head office and they had the owner of the location call me.  I have rarely found an alleged business owner to be so unprofessional.  She kept talking over me and saying that it's up to the franchisee whether to accept coupons or not.  What kind of franchise system allows their franchisees to make up their own rules?  The coupon does NOT state anything about being valid at participating locations only.
I called back to Subway head office and they told me that their franchisees don't have to accept their coupons, because it would amount to illegal \"price fixing\".  What nonsense!  I wonder how legal the word \"fraud\" sounds to them, when they offer a coupon deal and then refuse to honour it.
I'm finished with Subway restaurants and informed them of such.
My advice is to steer clear of this location, at any rate.  The woman who runs it clearly wants the customers, as evidenced by the other ratings here in addition to mine, to accede to her wishes, rather than the other way around.
Businesses with such a philosophy need to be punished by seeing a nosedive in their sales.  Again, ALL Subway restaurants will suffer my lack of business going forward.  If I can't trust an enterprise to do something as basic as redeem one of their own coupons, then they won't get any of my money."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this location is 24 hours.  You can't say that for many Subway's and with them rolling out there new breakfast menu it helps a lot, check out the english muffin breakfast sandwiches, they are great!  As for everything else it's a Subway, there is not much more you can say, the staff is friendly and the store itself is usually pretty clean, just about what you would expect from any Subway."}
{"text":"Top notch, kudos to Carol.  She was fast and efficient.  Awesome service!  I was in and out of this FAST food restaurant in about 3 mins."}
{"text":"Just tried the Fritos enchilada melt. Not a bad lunch. Had to try it... Not sure Id get another one. It gets a little busy during lunch so the staff just focuses on getting you in and out. 
If i eat there i'll usually pick the meatball marinara or the buffalo chicken."}
{"text":"Subway is always reliable. Food is fresh and tasty. Service is prompt and courteous. Always a good idea to pick up a sandwich there."}
{"text":"New to the area for work and was looking for something close by for my lunch hour. This is the best subway I have been in in a long time. The customer service at this location is what every small fast food/fast casual restaurant should be like. It was really clean and the staff was friendly, but not in a fake annoying way. One employee even making sure the floor was spotless (unlike other restaurants that don't sweep up often enough) and asked if I was done and took my tray for me. Great service! I'll be back on a regular basis! (This is my first time bothering to post any reviews, so that says something!)"}
{"text":"I Always order the same sandwiches on any subways. It's just to my liking: \"sweet onion-teriyaki\" sandwich! 
With mozzarella cheese, olives, and the veggie works!
All this on a grilled flatbread!
Yummy!
I never order my drinks extra large ever!
Hello folks, it's a soda fountain kinda thing!
That means no limits!
If I'm eating inside why pay extra dime if I could go back for more drinks! 
Besides when I'm done eating there, I don't drink anymore soda, at least for that time being...
But hey, the service were pretty quick and delightful!  I don't know what some people talk about service complaints all the time!
The complainers must have belong to the \"complain department\"; they came out to eat and complain....lol!
Sorry folks, you ate it all so no refunds!! Haha
And hey sorry guys no pictures this time because I was so hungry that I ate my sandwich like water and forgot the yelp pictures!
Maybe next time!
Enjoy your meal!
Don't complain too much!
You could be that person behind the counter you know!"}
{"text":"Went to this location last night and something had burnt somewhere. The smell was really bad. Ordered my sandwiches and was not pleased by what I was seeing behind the glass. The guacamole was brown and the cutting boards did not look like they had been cleaned in days. People making the sandwiches knew what to ask but I am not sure if they knew what to do. I will go to the subway two miles away before I return to this one."}
{"text":"Slowest Subway ever...
Sorry for the negative but come on. The place looks great though, really like the new style of decor and active menu/sandwich boards."}
{"text":"The line for this subway was astronomical. Literally, out the food court into the main hallway.  They worked pretty quickly though getting everyone their order. 

It was great to eat at a known restaurant and not get gauged. The prices in Vegas can be high, especially with all the 30$ buffets.  My girlfriend and I don't gamble so buying a few drinks throughout the night can really add up. 

This subway was consistent with most others. Food portions were what I have come to expect from this chain.

I would recommend coming on off times to avoid the lines. But, recommend overall."}
{"text":"VERY POOR RATINGS FOR ME! The workers are rude and reluctant on helping you at all. I believe that all they want is your money and you out the door! Not only were the employees rude but the MANAGER was The RUDEST OF THEM ALL! This short haired woman was so NOT being her entitled \"MANAGER\" postion and in my opinion should be REPLACED IMMEDIATELY. I work in this shopping complex and can assure you that I'm not the only one who will refuse to go there again!"}
{"text":"Embarrassing when i'm at this location. The workers can barely speak english and are very rude. I had to tell them my order over 5 times. I had to ask for more lettuce 3 times as they would put close to nothing. Smells like an arm pit in there and all the meat looks 2 years old. Very poor place to eat never going back there again."}
{"text":"Worst Subway I've ever been to! I do not feel like I got my money's worth for what little there was.

Meatball Marinara is a waste of money here. At other locations, they seem larger, meatier. Here, small, dry, burned even! Literally charred. I couldn't believe it! I'm used to a sandwich bursting with meat and sauce and flavour, and here I find myself served by lazy assemblers scuffing their feet to the front, lazily scooping OLD DRIED OUT MEATBALL MARINARA! Honestly, if you can't do your job, then quit and let some else who can!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch today the young girl started slapping my food down, literally had to ask her to fix some things. I didn't realize it was rocket science to make it look pretty too. OH! And whose ever idea it was to hide the regular chips and only have the Reuben and Gyro chips out is stupid. Not everyone likes those and having to ask for regular chips like it's a speciality is weird. I'll stick with coming close to midnight, the blonde guy is always nice and patient with making the food."}
{"text":"Thought this Subway was fine on multiple visits.
But just got immediate onset food poisoning from a footlong ham sandwich. Within half an hour of eating it, the fever and nausea were too severe for me to take the TTC home; killer headache and further digestive symptoms followed. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"My doctor's office is just across the parking lot from this Subway, so whenever I get my physical, I get a sandwich afterward, as a treat. Have been doing this for the past 4 years. This has always been a great place to grab a sandwich to-go and take it home. Generally, this is about 9:30 or 10:00 am, soon after they open. I went Tuesday morning and got one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had from any Subway. The bread was absolutely dry and stale and crumbled to the touch. The lettuce tasted as though it had been cut days before and was slightly gummy in texture... I almost gagged when I put it in my mouth. The meat and cheese were okay, but couldn't make up for the bread and lettuce, which ruined my appetite. I ended up just throwing the entire footlong in the trash. Yeah, it was that bad. The service from the young woman could not have been more unfriendly and I felt as though I was bothering her, though I was the only customer. Obviously, there has been a change in ownership or management. I won't ever go back to this store.... ever."}
{"text":"This location has new employees, new smiles, very friendly location. Love going to this location. Much cleaner than some of the others down the road."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to this store it is always nice and clean.  I always order the chopped salad, and yet to be disappointed.  When family came to town they went to this subway and had the same experience.  Some employees are friendlier than others, but overall they do a good job."}
{"text":"They do skimp on the ingredients and their prices seem higher?  We had still been going there for years as its a walk from our place to the village of Bronte. Will never go in there again as our cat went missing on the weekend and they would not let us leave a missing cat notice.  I know they are not obliged to do so, however it's a close community and that was not very neighborly.  We got our cat back after three days, and they lost our business forever."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service they made my sandwich just how I like it. The people were very nice and professional. The food was also done really good and fast."}
{"text":"Their breads are pretty good ! a lot of fresh vege! nice serive but maybe not speak pretty good E , that let to misunderstand sometime! still in my list to go back! :)"}
{"text":"Mostly always a great experience last time I went the girl was super nice she was real small with burgundy hair, she turned my whole day around with how nice she was."}
{"text":"Average customer service,  average sandwich making skills, average speed. Hence average rating."}
{"text":"I am literally walking distance from another Subway location (Main & Robson) & I would rather get in my car and drive here to eat at this one. 

Staff is very friendly and their sandwiches just taste better. Plus nice view to relax for lunch."}
{"text":"There's not a whole lot that a Subway location can do wrong, but this one does it. They consistently run out of various condiments as lunch progresses and as far as I can tell do not restock until the next day. 

On multiple occasions they have ran out of spinach, avocado, and lettuce. And each time the employees do not do anything to acknowledge or make up for the difference. 

I really do not recommend this location, but unfortunately am not left with many other options as this is the closest Subway to my workplace."}
{"text":"This establishment does not even deserve one star. I waited for 15 minutes and still no one came out from the back. I said hello many times in attempt to get someones attention. Completely ridiculous and terrible service."}
{"text":"Costumer service was horrible. They were rude and did not care about their customers. However the sandwich is just like any other subway. I would definitely expect a hello or acknowledgement went we enter but there was none."}
{"text":"To Jacob, the all star making $9 an hour....

For such a tall guy, you sure act like a little bitch, sincerely,

The guy who said guac instead of avocado. P.S. eat a dick you lanky bitch"}
{"text":"I like this subway because it's close to home and it's always kept clean.  The staff isn't the most friendly, but they always get my order right and that's what counts to me.  I like that they play a local radio station that has good music."}
{"text":"Finally, a Subway near my house.  I love going to Subway for all of the different healthy options that I can choose. I love coming here for lunch, dinner or whenever I am hungry.  The staff is always very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"poor service and it was dirty. the worker didnt wear gloves when making my sub, and the bread was stale. the drink machine was broken, so i wasnt able to enjoy a drink while eating. the floors and tables looked like they havent been washed in a month. the worker there, mary was so mean to mean. i was very disappointed with this subway and would not recommend anyone to go there"}
{"text":"I was warmly greated upon entering this facility by Joselyn.  The place was very clean but was cleaning anyways she then made me the best oven roasted chicken sandwich I have ever had at a Subway restaurant.  The food was excellent an the service was amazing.  I didn't see the infamous owner \"Scott\" yelling at his employees or see him at all for that matter.  I will definitely recommend this Subway to my friends and neighbors who live in this neighborhood with me."}
{"text":"If you have to go to subway between 3-4, I'd recommend just going to the one on Sixth St. because the girls working were gossiping and slow and inattentive. The order I make usually takes 5 min took twice as long. The girl making the sandwich kept giggling with the other worker and ignored me while I was making my order."}
{"text":"Place was clean, standard food for a subway.  However there was only one employee Sunday at lunch, leading to a long wait.  Never been to a subway with one person making all the sandwiches and running the register.  She was pleasant, but said she works alone all the time.  Not sure that's the best plan to run the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went in at 8:40 Sunday night and the place looked closed so I checked online to see the store hours and it said they close at 9pm. 
Well I decided to go in and the girl asked me if I was paying cash or card , she had already closed the register early because they were slow, anyway I ended up taking my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"Subways is Subways, and they generally all taste the same consistently and have pretty decent quality ingredients. The reason for the low rating at this particular location is because of our server. He was very rushed, brusque, and stingy when it came to any of the add-ons. 

Not sure if it was this location that was stingy or if it was just the server. I had to ask three times for more bell peppers because he barely put any on each time, and just didn't bother with the rest of the ingredients or we'd be there for a while. 

He also dropped something behind the counter at one point and picked it up to throw away without changing his gloves as he went back to prepare food. Since I didn't see what it was or where/how he picked it up I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. Over charged for a buy one get one. Super gross because they touched everything before touching my sandwich."}
{"text":"I really appreciate the service and the kind staff at this store. They are always friendly. I've been to a couple of other Subways and they aren't as nice. I had a tuna sandwich and my friend had a BMT (Italian). Both were really good. The staff put everything we wanted on them, they were quick, the place was clean, and the food was very fresh and tasty. I love how this location is kind of the \"mom and pop\" franchise. It's really worth going to and spending time at. The people are great and the food is just fine."}
{"text":"Great place to get a cheap sandwich.  Also you can add some veggies to it.  I usually get the tuna or italian bmt.  The chicken and steak are also pretty good.  The bread is also freshly made."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place one star because I'm forced to give a star. I visited the subway more than two dozen times. While I am able to order my sub, I'm unable to get a sub for my husband. My husband likes his meatball sandwich. It seems though that the subway doesn't carry meatball. And yes that's an assumption based on experience. If you go to the subway after 3 PM even though it's open until 10 PM looking for a meatball sandwich you'll be disappointed. 

I understand it's a subway. And there's another one probably 2 miles away. But this one is right outside my subdivision and I don't think it's that difficult to properly ensure you have the correct levels of supplies to make a simple sandwich."}
{"text":"This place can't be worse. It's not clean. Service is bad. I have witnessed( twice) how the sandwich maker touched money with her gloves for the previous customer and then made a sandwich with the same gloves. This is disgusting and I hope they close down soon."}
{"text":"Good location . 
Tried them on a Saturday because I need something fast 
Honestly speaking, subway is not my usual place because I rather have a hero burger when it comes to fast food. 
The service was okay and on the indifference side. (Hey it is fast food ) 
The server was impatient with me because I don't know the \"drill\" - order bread, meat, topping and sauce. But with there'll of my friend, I ordered my chicken with 2 toppings and chipotle sauce. 

Only challenge is that there were lots of people on a sunny Saturday. Some people occupied the spots with tables not cleared , so obviously we had to clear our own table and wiped it clean, after the crowd left. 

Food was okay , but the service can be improved."}
{"text":"Definitely not surprised why this specific store has so many bad reviews. I always come to this subway because it's closer to my apartment. Tonight, I pulled into the parking lot and I parked crookedly (no one else was in the parking lot) and I walked into the subway. Some pansy little kid with the worst attitude told me to move my car. I told him no one else was in the entire parking lot being that this is at 9pm. He gave me the nastiest look I've ever received from anyone I was giving business to. His attitude was so rude, and I specifically remember this kid because he's always had a horrible attitude whenever I come in. He should not be working there if he is so miserable being there. From now on, I'm driving the extra couple miles to the next subway instead of this dump."}
{"text":"I went here today to get a BMT. the line was short, and the store was well kept. I could tell the owners take pride in the store. 
on top of that the person who helped me was well informed and answered all my questions. I loved how friendly the person was and attentive to what I asked for. I will be returning to this location on a regular basis and highly recommend it for others!"}
{"text":"The girl name Farrah seem not happy with her job. She gave attitude when i order more than 1  sandwiches. Customer service is horrible. No change in the cashier, She took my money didn't give change she walk away and let the guy clueless does't know what to do. We just stared at each other cause he don't have change. Never come here again."}
{"text":"First time today and the place was clean. Friendly server and great service! I would definitely go back again. I always like independent subways not the ones inside walmarts or gas stations (just side info)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst service in town!!!! It's the only Subway close to where I work and I really wanted Subway but I promise this time I will NEVER be back to this one again.   These girls have such a BAD, BAD attitudes!!!! I have reviewed this location before because of bad service and still they have bad service 5 months later.  I wish I had walked out before I got my food.   It was a terrible experience.   I would like to find the franchise owner of this location and let them know just how bad these girls are.   If I was an employer I would want to know that I had girls like this working my business.  They would be fired immediately!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  I'm so disappointed in this subways. My family and I eat here at lease 4 times a month. We always had a good experience but lately the serviced has changed. It has went from a 5 to a 1 in my book. Employees are very Rude and they argue with each other and  even the customer... I'm going to really change my subways maybe even switch to port of subs I'm all about customer service."}
{"text":"Walked into this subway with a list of seven subs all custom orders; right during a lunch time rush... People behind the counter knocked it out pretty quick, and with a good attitude. Can't really ask for more than that."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and the bread had just came out of the oven."}
{"text":"This subway is very Clean and the Staff is Great.   Love that they give the local high school students job opportunites!  Great food"}
{"text":"Best subway ever!!!!! Rae is the best employee there is!!!!! Really impressed by the sandwich too!!! Great great subway !!"}
{"text":"This Subway is extremely cheap on the veggies. . . Be sure to ASK for more than two slices of tomato, etc.  Especially In comparison to the mentor ave mentor Ohio location, near Heinen's on the north side. . . They do it right the first time. Very generous with the toppings"}
{"text":"Old brown lettuce, dry meat, unfriendly staff at 12 noon, the place wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and it's never too crowded. Depending on whom is serving you with depend on how good your sandwich is. Meaning if I say I want a lot of spinach on my sandwich, it doesn't mean 5 extra pieces lol. I mean I want a salad between my flatbread lol."}
{"text":"this subway is a great place to visit.  the workers greet you when you come in and when you leave.  you can always get the exact thing you order there and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"My sandwich artist was in quite the mood one day. I ignored it, a week later went back. Was glared at by the same girl behind the counter and then wasn't sure if she knew my order because she didn't say one word to me. Only thing she told me was my total. Steer clear!!!!"}
{"text":"Best place in Scarborough when you want a sandwich for less then £2
THere are 2 subways now in Boro, this one is slap bang in the town centre.
Great selection of fillings, quick and simple."}
{"text":"Came here to buy a sandwich for lunch and it was delicious. As a matter of fact it was my first time trying it out. Sounds crazy but yeah I really didn't know what was great until I ask for their opinion and they were kind of enough to go over with me of what I like in my sandwich. I appreciate there customer service thanks subway!"}
{"text":"I'm the President of Ditto Advertising and hardly ever leave a review but I stopped in after a meeting and Paul was very gracious to a very rude customer. He later went to find her to see if she was satisfied with the outcome and she made a scene in front of the hundred passengers.  Good job Paul for being the bigger person and representing Subway well."}
{"text":"The Subway Soccer Centre is the best indoor facility in Calgary! 

Too bad the bubble structure collapsed in 2010. Still a premiere soccer facility!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best subway restaurants there is in Madison. The ingredients are always very fresh and the staff is friendly. They moved recently next door and now the restaurant has a brand new equipment and outside seating. If I ever crave fast food/take out, this is the first place I think of."}
{"text":"It's Subway. The food is the food.

What I really cant get past is the staff at this place.  I stop here on my way home from work often and almost everytime I stop the staff surprises me with something new and inappropriate.

Whether it's sexual conversations between employees or just a total lack of regard for me the customer I am never \"disappointed\""}
{"text":"I wish I couldn't even give a star to this place. Aweful. My mom ordered a salad and they didn't even have a fork, one of the basic necessities in a restaurant. They microwaved this ladies pizza and turned it to rubber. They microwaved My sandwich AFTER they put the vegetables, that's common sense the sandwich was rubbery and my dad and I keep making jokes about it."}
{"text":"Its expensive and the service is not good. Although few customers wait in line, the staff were in a hurry as if there were a large crowd, even put the wrong veg in since have been told twice."}
{"text":"Great customer service. I go in frequently and can always go in and be greeted as soon as I hit the door and thanked for on my way out. Miguel the manager is awesome to! Stand up guy and he holds his associates to a high standard and it shows in their customer service."}
{"text":"Subway location in a Mac's location just off of Blackfoot. Came here to grab lunch while in the area. Very clean and fast service."}
{"text":"Everyone who has made my sandwich was quite rude and obnoxious. I went on Friday night and had a nice young lady who made my sandwich and she told me she's only been their a month! Sad that the workers who have been there longer are so rude. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't go to this Subway restaurant. They don't honor the discount cards programs they join, so they get the benefit of the advertising and getting people to go to that location, but then don't give the promised discount. You're just told too bad.

And, they're slow."}
{"text":"Was a great until the new owners. Now you just know your going to get food poisoning as soon as you walk in. It was so hot in there the cheese was melting in the containers."}
{"text":"Super stingy on the veggies- 4 tomatoes and 4 cucumbers on a foot long VEGGIE sandwich! I asked for extra cheese, and of course I was charged for it! I'm used to paying extra for additional cheese, but with the measly amount of veggies, I was hoping.... Also very pushy with trying to get me to buy add-ons like drink, chips, cookies, soup, etc.  I politely said \"no\" out loud, but was thinking in my head I'd probably need all of those things with the miniscule amount of veggies I received. I'll stick with my regular Subway store on Gilbert and Southern where they are very generous."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this particular Subway I remember why I avoid this one. Lets start with the food. If you order a kids meal, they use the leftover scraps of bread. Today, it was no longer than an inch and a half. One piece of ham folded over and it hung out the sides. Two pickles and a glob of mayonnaise the size of a dime in the middle. Lets go to their menu. Right now, 6\" cold cut or meatball subs are 2.00. They dont have that posted ANYWHERE. they tried to charge me full price and I had to show them my e-mail. With that said, good luck getting much veggies on your sandwich. While they make your sandwich you actually get the feeling you are inconveniencing them. They throw everything in very sloppy. Vinefar and oil they squirt in one spot. 
Very rude staff. I usually avoid this particular one. When I do come back to it, its always the same. Drive an extra couple miles to a different one."}
{"text":"Workers are always cheery...  Never had any problems, except once.  The young man only put on one glove after handling money and touched my sandwich while wrapping it.  Not cool.

This is my GO TO Subway though...I still go back.  They are quick and do a good job.

If you like bread more soft then overcooked, this is your place."}
{"text":"My new favorite Subway location. From the friendly staff to the care and pride in construction of my sandwich, it's was a awesome."}
{"text":"I usually love subway, but this location is not your usual good food. The service was good & the workers very nice. The food however was very disappointing. When I got home the bread was hard & very dry. The cheese wasn't melted, over all the three sandwiches tasted stale. They were scraping the bottom of the containers of the toppings. They should refill sooner & use fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"They acted like they were closed and I was there 40 minutes before their posted closing time.  The sign was off, they were out of meatballs and when I changed my order the were out of mustard and refused to fill the bottle.  I will never be back"}
{"text":"Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.  The staff is outstanding and really hustles.  When you walk in the door they dish out a \"hi, welcome to Subway\".  If there's any kind of a wait, even just one person ahead of you, they will let you know they'll be with you in a minute.  The bread is always fresh, no exceptions.  Been to many Subways where it's obvious the bread is a couple days old.

If you're ever in the area you can't go wrong stopping at this Subway.  It really is better."}
{"text":"I love subway!  This location had a great young lady working... I went in with am order of 24 sandwiches... She was great!!"}
{"text":"WORST Subway ever!!! Went through the drive thru last night about 8pm. After putting order in on kiosk, pulled up to window and heard a girl yell \"order at the window\". So I waited....and waited...and don't waited....12 minutes later no one came to the window. I pulled around front, no customers in the store so I go inside. My order is sitting on the front counter and a girl comes out from the back (young enough to be my child) \"hey honey, thus your order?\". I said if it was the one for the drive thru then yes, it is mine, I don't see anyone else here. I asked if they used the window and she said yes she told the other guy to go to it but he didn't want to. Ok so??? You just ignore customers because you feel like it? She avoids the questions and give me my total, tr walls me to slide my card, hands me my meal and walks off. I told her people use the drive thru for a reason and she tells back whatever! Not only was the servuce horribke, i got home and my order was wrong! These were obviously immature brats working, no manager! Unbelievable that someone would trust their business to these individuals, let alone allow them to treat customers so poorly! Obviously from other reviews this is a huge issue and they don't care. I couldn't get a hold of a manager today so I just emailed corporate direct."}
{"text":"Wow... Hailey either really hates her job... Or maybe just life. But pleasant customer service is everything. The sour attitude made me want to go someplace else."}
{"text":"The good: Flat bread was amazingly fresh and did not taste like emulsified cardboard flour paste. A rare find at Subways lately.

The not so good: No BBQ sauce and some of the veggies were starting to turn. Fuze tea had a time stamp sticker from 6:20AM at 8PM. As someone who has had food poisoning from the Fuze tea's several times I always check now. They are supposed to be dumped, cleaned, and freshly brewed every six hours from what I have been told. Staff was friendly but could use some basic POS re-training.

Also, several of the ceiling tiles were open which is a health code violation."}
{"text":"Line was almost 15 people deep and they had ONE employee working. ONE. 

I didn't even attempt to wait"}
{"text":"When I walked in I got no welcome, the guy had an attitude and was acting like he is doing me a favor.. I just walked out and said to him to change the way you treat customers.. Horrible!"}
{"text":"Open surprisingly late so it makes a good alternative to the usual kebab or pizza after a night out.


 Fresh bread, part baked on premises, and fresh ingredients.


 The staff are friendly and very helpful.


 I would recommend the meatball or teriaki chicken on honey oat bread :)"}
{"text":"We used to go here a lot and never had issues using digital coupons texted by Subway. Not until there's this new cashier named Olivia who refuses to take coupons because she said all these reasons : \"the coupon is not in the system\", \"it's for a different bread\", \"we just had a meeting and most of the coupons that Subway sent to their customers are wrong\". I've been all over the country eating at Subway and uses their digital and paper coupons and never had issues. I'm an avid Subway customer and so as my kids. So I think we better tell Subway not to send text messages with deals to their customers because according to one of their cashiers most of the time they're wrong. I went to another Subway store and used my digital q with no problem."}
{"text":"Cassandra was extremely rude and sloppy. Took 5 minutes for her to notice me because she was glued to her phone. Gave me dirty looks and did not greet me. After she gave me my change she did not say anything at all like thank you or smile she just turned around and went back to playing on her phone. Worst costumer service I have ever received and would not get served from her again. Very unprofessional"}
{"text":"See my tip! Subway just sucks. They are cheap and want to charge for extra ingredients! How about putting on a fair amount of ingredients in the first place!"}
{"text":"Worst Subway I have ever been to. Three of us ordered personal pizzas. The very rude woman making them was in a big hurry. She was rushing everything. We would tell her one of things we wanted in it and she would quickly throw it on and then put it right in the oven before we had a chance to say what else we wanted on it. So once it came out of the oven we said we wanted vegetables in it. They said well if we put veggies on it now and put back in the oven it will make the pizza too hard. We said but we were not done saying what we wanted on the pizza. The rude lady didnt even ask if we wanted anything else. She just rushed it in the oven   The cashiers asked the lady making the pizza what happened and she started blaming us. Speaking in spanish that we were being to slow and picky. They didnt realize that our friend that was with us speaks spanish si she understood everything.  Si she called the woman out on it and theu tried to deny what they said. All very rude people working their. Horrible service and the pizza sucked. Mine was nit even cooked enough, my Husband had to have raw veggies on his because theu already cooked the pizza before he was able to add toppings. Just a horrible experience. Avoid this Subway at all cost. ."}
{"text":"With regards to the food, it was all right. Exactly what you would expect from a Subway franchise. However, the service was lacking. The woman working behind the counter was very cordial, however the man was not. This was the first time I had been to this location and I did not leave with a good impression. My debit chip could not be recognized by the machine and I asked if something was wrong. He made a big deal about blaming me and it was embarrassing. The worst thing was, there wasn't anything wrong with it (I had used it just prior and many times since)."}
{"text":"I went in at 10am this morning and I did not get any type of customer service. The employee (African American girl, some what stocky, medium lengths hair) assisted me and greated me with a \"are you going to get a sandwich\" assuming that anything else was out of the question for some reason. 

She did not smile, rung me up, and walked away without saying goodbye and left it to myself to grab my items that where closer to her the. They were to me.

The only way I can describe the customer service (or lack there of) is a spoiled teenager who was not happy to work there and was waiting for my transaction to be completed so she can get back to social media on her cell phone."}
{"text":"Just so you know Subway's bread is not made fresh I went in at 10:30 a.m. and they said the bread was fresh made daily I found out later it was made theday before before but yet they keep advertising how fresh it is lol I guess that's why they always like to toast your sandwich so you won't see how near to the bread is at other subways I've been to their bread is fresh dislocation probably doesn't do much business lol they lost my business and they had an attitude when I told him the bread was not fresh"}
{"text":"Just horrible customer service and will never be going to that subways again. Paid more attention of the other things going on that blamed me for not hearing my order and then question why I didn't stop her when like if I knew how to put the sandwhich together"}
{"text":"The staff is so rude words can't even express. If you hate your job that much find a new one dont take it out on your customers."}
{"text":"This is the best and friendliest subway ive been too. The workers always have a smile on there face and make great sandwich. Ive been there multiple times and they always succeed to satisfy."}
{"text":"Love those $5.00 Footlongs!!  That's two meals for me.  This Subway is nice, clean and the help is friendly.  They are all about the same I think.  You can eat pretty healthy there.  But I love their chocolate chip cookies!!"}
{"text":"as always subway's food is good. This one has a drive-though window which I think slows their service down a bit. Takes a little longer at the counter."}
{"text":"Was excited to eat my sub when I was munchkin away came across a hair wrapped around in my lettuce .... disgusting wear a hair net!"}
{"text":"Quick service, good ingredients, good prep, and good sandwich. What more could you want from a Subway?"}
{"text":"Again, more issues from the employee with an attitude, Assi.  This time tried to fool my wife into thinking that Subway had closed early.  The current time was 8:45pm and they close at 10pm.  No respect and continued to treat my wife in a belittling way.  Is there a number I can call to fix this poor customer service???"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved subway and their fresh selection. But since I found out that their bread contains a chemical found in yoga mats, I have never gone back since."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is the right subway, but I went to the subway on american pacific and stephanie st.  It's located behind the panda express and neighborhood walmart grocery store.
First of all, I would like to state, I WOULD NEVER GO HERE AGAIN.
I'm Asian American.  The workers here are racist to those that are not caucasian/white people.  I went to grab some early dinner before school.  There were 2 white teenage workers, 1 white manager and 4 white customers in front of me.  The 4 white customers in front of me were offered a free cookie when they paid for their sandwiches.  And as it was my turn to pay, I was not offered a cookie.  I decided to dine in and see if the other 4 white customers that followed behind me would be offered cookies.   While I was eating my sandwich, of course the next 4 white customers were all offered a free cookie.  
So, after I finished my sandwich, I decided to go up to the manager and told her that her employees did not offer me a free cookie.
She replied with, \"I'm sorry about that sir, would you like a cookie?\"
I denied her cookie and told her, I could care less about your cookie.  With her shallow mind, she thought I was angry about not getting a cookie.   It's the principle of offering cookies to every customer.
It's not about the cookie, it's about treating every customer like a human being.  
In conclusion, I will never go here again and if you see all white employees in there and you are not white, get the hell out.  
Happy Black History Month to you too!"}
{"text":"This was the worst subway experience. Amazingly skimpy with veggies.  They added 2 slices of each veggie for a foot long sandwich. Very sad"}
{"text":"I eat subway a lot to save money and have an alright meal. this subway tends to be a better subway. the staff here most days is pretty good to me. i think they guy i liked that worked there that i liked is gone so they might be on there way down the hill but you never know with subway hit or miss. good cookies ."}
{"text":"Best customer service here. The others are probably just blind. Cashiers are great here and very fast!"}
{"text":"Came in while I was getting an oil change, sat for about 30 minutes and used my free cookie from a survey I took, they were out of m&m cookies but the manager was so sweet and offered to make some fresh for me since I would be waiting a while. Best customer service I've seen in a while."}
{"text":"Has to be the greatest bunch of employees in the Subway empire, always the best customer service EVERY TIME!! Convenient and perfect sandwich every visit, lucky to have this location so close by, all of these guys and girls deserve a raise! Been coming here 3-4 times a week for awhile now for the rotisserie chicken, thank you 1000 times!"}
{"text":"Not one bad thing about this place! Clean, friendly, (not ghetto, as stated in a previous review) I will be coming here for years to come!"}
{"text":"Today, I found myself on Monona Drive.  I also found myself in need of lunch, and I found myself right next to this Subway.

I noticed that this particular subway has a drive-through - so I gave it a try.

Driving up to the menu board and speaker/mic, I was immediately told that a very large order had just been placed and it would be about eight minutes.  Had I been in a hurry, I would have thanked him and left, but I wasn't in a hurry.  I was already there and a few extra minutes wouldn't kill me.

About four minutes of quiet introspection later, a guy pulled in behind me (apparently their drive-up lunch rush had a bit of a lull).  I got out of my car and kindly told him about the delay.  He kindly thanked me and left to explore other options.

Two minutes of Facebooking later, a gentleman piped up on the speaker and asked to take my order.  I began to give it, and then he interrupted me with a \"please hold on\"...  A full minute later, another voice came on to take my order.  

As far as placing an order at a drive up window goes, it wasn't the best or the worst of similar experiences.

Pulling up to the window, a young chap (or yung samich artist) came to the window and verified the bread-type or some vegetable quandry regarding the order (I don't remember what it was, but it was good.  Attention to detail is a solid plus).  Then, another gentleman came to the window and offered me a free beverage to make up for the wait.  He was either management or bucking for a promotion - but I liked him nonetheless.  

I declined, stating that I wasn't thirsty (this seemed to befuddle him, as most people will accept outdated dairy products if they're free of charge).  But, in the grand scheme of things, offering me a bucks-worth of Fanta was an astute move, so a solid plus again.  

It is Subway, but there's a drive-through.  They got my order correct and it was agreeable in quality and presentation.  Their employees treated me well.

But I wonder what happened to the guy who first offered to take my order and then disappeared...  Best left a mystery, I suppose."}
{"text":"According to the new employees, this new manager does not order enough food for the volume of customers. This is the third time in a month. We left and went to the competing store. Message to the manager, this is a great way to lose business. Corporate will be looking at your store real soon. May the Force be with you."}
{"text":"I had very bad service and food. One particular employee act as if she couldn't speak, just point to the condiments to indicate what I wanted to go on it.  Also, the sandwiches me and my wife got were very skimpy for the money we paid for. I will not return again."}
{"text":"This store is so poorly staffed most often can't  wait for food.just there today 2 of the slowest sandwich makers ,had to leave.wanted lunch today!!! Only two people ahead of me!!I cold not believe how long it took to make one sandwich!! I am done!!"}
{"text":"This place is clean and fun. During lunch rush, the sandwich crew seem happy and upbeat. Very fun place to go."}
{"text":"Twice now my wife has gone through the drive thru only to get home and find out her order wasn't even remotely close to being right. She ordered a BLT and got home and only had bacon on it. Can't find a phone number to call and tell the manager."}
{"text":"Under new management

Owner is very sweet and friendly. While I was there, one of his staff members (I assume was new) was pretty clueless and took forever and was very unsure of what he was doing. He also made a mistake on the lady in front of me's sub. The owner offered her a discount. He greeted everyone who entered and was very helpful. My only complaint: no rootbeer in the fountain drink machine :("}
{"text":"Every time we stop here the service is excellent and accurate! Even while training a new employee Emily kept the line moving and service great!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Subway fan for quick cheap eats.  A Subway lunch has been the norm for me over the past 5 years.  

At this location, food is average for a subway but the service is the worst you will find. The kids making your sub never seem to know what they are doing. The owner is constantly yelling at the sandwich artist as they make your sandwich.  It is shocking to see the owner treat his employees in this manner in front of customers. The owner is strange and aloof and not customer service oriented.  

There are plenty of Subways in Vegas, stay away from this one.  I recommend the Quiznos across the street if you are looking for good food and service."}
{"text":"There's a lot of variation in Subway from location to location, more so in Tempe than in other places I've been.

I seem to always have some sort of issue at this location. Sometimes it's relatively minor where they don't seem to be paying attention (\"just a little mayo\" means \"just a little,\" not \"let's see how much mayo we can get on the sandwich). Other times, it's just a complete mess. On one of these days, they handed me a sandwich that someone had opened and returned (our sandwiches got switched around, which is never surprising at this location). A bit unsanitary, but then lied about it, which really irritated me.

They always seem really stressed out and frantic around lunch time, like many places are. But instead of being stressed and efficient, everyone just seems to be running around confused and in the way. The person who I believe is the manager at this location consistently seems to make it worse. They're actually not that busy for a sandwich place. Jimmy John's and some others in the area are much busier.

I'm going to try and avoid this location from now on."}
{"text":"Subway seems to have a really high variation in quality from location to location. This is one of the better ones I've been to, especially in Tempe. I used to live really close and ended up going here a lot for lunch. There were only a couple times when the experience wasn't stellar, which is a really good track record. Friendly people and they actually get the order right (not as common as you might think). They're constantly cleaning and picking up trash in the dining area."}
{"text":"Update !!

Took almost two weeks to find and solve the problem in question. And at the end of the day both the owner and manager did an outstanding job making things right. 

I thank the owner for doing the right thing!!"}
{"text":"We went there after moving into the area and was very disappointed in the service.   The man and woman behind the counter were unfriendly and the store looked dirty.   We lost our appetite and vowed never to go back again.   I understand they own the shop.  They need to get over their hateful demeanor."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service every time! I try to give this location another chance, I swear they screw up with me every time !either it's old food, slow people, poor service the way they talk to you or the way they deal with your food and handle your food how this place is still in business I do not understand as of right now but I promise you one thing today was the last chance I ever give this place it's sad because they are located in my neighborhood and it was very convenient to go there however I am tired of the poor attitudes the down talking in the way that they treat the customers at this location I will never go back again!"}
{"text":"First off, I LOVE Subway. I eat there almost daily, and sometimes twice daily. This is the absolute worst Subway I have ever eaten, and this being said after trying to give this place a chance because I am close to it often. No matter.... I will drive somewhere else. The stores appearance is ok but the help is choking the business. There are a few foreign girls working there that almost ignore you and anyone else that walks in the door. As you patiently stand there waiting, they will eventually ask you what you want (appearing like you are bothering them) and then pile all of your ingredients in a huge pile in the center of your sandwich, and debate you when you try to get them to put stuff at the ends, and not completely smother one side with mayo and try to move their hand to the side attempting to cover rest of sandwich yet only leaving a dribble past the first mountainous pile. They talk about you in their other language like your not even standing there. The absolute RUDEST staff possible. Does the owner even know what is going on there? Or do they even care?

Drive 10 miles to another one, or find a Jersey Mikes somewhere...."}
{"text":"No spinach! What makes some Subway restaurants have spinach and not others? Almost not worth going to for this reason.

Otherwise, average Subway expectations."}
{"text":"I haven't heard from my gf Kassandra in 6 months.

Meatball sub is pretty good.

Probably will have to eat it alone."}
{"text":"It's like most Subway restaurants minus a few changes like water logged chicken, however the fun comes in from the customer service.  By customer service, I pretty much mean the lack thereoff.  Staff is very rude and seems be more bothered by your mere presence in the store.  It is close to my work, but I am about to start driving to one that is further away just to not have to deal with them."}
{"text":"Normally I have no problem ordering at subway but this one is very greedy when I asked for extra olives they wanted to charge me....needless to say I will never go back to this one!"}
{"text":"This subway has the worst customer service. The employees are super rude and always have an attitude about doing their job. They don't clean their soda machine drain which causes the restaurant to stink like rotten eggs."}
{"text":"Always very helpful and courteous.  I usually get catering from them and everything is always ready on time."}
{"text":"Terrible employees. They mumble inaudibly when speaking, don't listen to your order and are all around unfriendly. I have never felt to uncomfortable while ordering food."}
{"text":"Run, do not walk, \"Margaret C.\"


bad bad bad

poor service, RUDE PEOPLE, over expensive"}
{"text":"I read the other reviews previously, but the guys now have only been courteous, hard working, and customer-service oriented to the last minute (I walked in a few minutes before closing a few times). I've been in the Service Industry for 17 years & the guys that work here now, deserve some praise. I can't vouch for anyone else before, but they rock now."}
{"text":"Great subway shop, it's open 24/7! Good for those late night snacks.... Tip: when getting the sub toasted ask for some green peppers ontop ;)"}
{"text":"We use this one because it is right by the boyfriends house.  Not too bad most of the time.  Have had a few wing-nut help incidents, but not as bad as other review.  Most of the time, we have had no problems.  No dine in at this one,"}
{"text":"O.K. I think this is one of the best in the area.  I have eaten at a lot of Subways but this one in Westwood Town Center (by Marc's) is pretty decent.    Recently the boyfriend and I went here 4 dinner and there was a mix up with my sandwich and a to-go order who was busy playing with his phone and not paying attention.  The order was corrected with many apologies and I was given a $5 gift card as a refund.  They were still apologizing as I left.  I must say, that I have mix ups at other locations and I have never had it fixed so quickly,, or as politely as this location.  Others haven't even made an effort to fix a problem and this is why I drive to this one, and not walk to the one by my house."}
{"text":"Again, I will drive to this one rather than walk to the one by me because of service. Always clean  and always gets my order right. They even under stand \"a lot of cheese, please\"."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is for this particular Subway.  Most have subpar service and questionable hygeine, but I was famished on the drive home last night, debated on a flatbread at dunkin donuts but i have those too often....and saw this Subway so I pulled in for a grilled chicken sandwich.  

I walked in to a full house, but both employees behind the counter gave big smiles and eye contact and acted like they not only cared about their jobs, but about making good sandwiches and being nice to their customers.  Big thumbs up for service!  These two won my heart over....I hope they stick around."}
{"text":"Yummy subs and good week day staff. The weekend staff is not so friendly."}
{"text":"This Subway has some issues. The place is clean and the help is great but the management policies are suspect if not downright illegal. I go to this subway as it is within walking distance to my house and seems like every time I go there something interesting happens. 
For starters the staff cannot give you every kind of cheese on site. The \"artist\" informed me that \"management\" had told them to no longer offer the shredded cheddar on peoples sandwiches - only on the cheesy bread. In addition I have been told \"management\" also made certain limitations on how much of each topping can be put on a sandwich which includes limiting lettuce to barely covering and a mere 3 shreds of onion and 3 pickles per 6\" sandwich.
The worst \"management\" decision though which I find very suspect and nearly illegal is the way they have setup the cash register. Attempt to use a coupon in this place and watch the register. I went from a $7 sub on the board and a $2 off coupon to a $6.50 sub. Asked to explain I was told \"management charges another price for coupon based transactions - actually my sub was $8.50\" This seems very dubious. This is not the first time this has happened though, as the price on the board here doesn't always equal what the register will charge, especially when it comes to coupons. It seems like the help has to put in a set price half the time rather than use the standard functions or otherwise you might find yourself paying 50-75% more than what is advertised.
I love Subways but wont be returning to this one, the Hawaiian place next door is just a nice and are honest in advertising."}
{"text":"I eat subway almost daily and this Subway is one of the best i have ever been to.  They always welcome me and start my order quickly.  I am fairly picky with the way my sub is made and they always take it in stride, in fact most of the staff has my order memorized.  

All of the staff is very friendly and more than happy to chat.  The store owner and his wife work at the location often and have a good grasp of whats going on in their store, which i appreciate.

It always clean and I hardly ever have to wait!  I sometimes go out of my way just to go to this specific Subway.

Kudos Guys!"}
{"text":"Was in today, poor guy was working by himself. And some B from the dance school had a long special order for him while he was busy in the first place. While she was stealing cups upon cups for who ever came in and flustering the employee we decided to leave. I hope the owner see this and knows the employee did all he could and the lady I'm sure will try to get all her money back."}
{"text":"I usually don't get good customer service at this location so I rarely go. But I thought I should just give this place a second chance and also I was starving so I had no choice haha. But the instant I walked in the artisan named Ashley was so nice and has such radiant energy that it even made me happy!  I think I'll come back again because of her!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Subway! They hire the best people with great attitudes. There's never a dull moment when I go there! And the food is good, of course."}
{"text":"Second time eating at this location on Stephanie. Served stale bread and skimpy vegetables. This place has totally gone downhill. Skip it and go somewhere else. At least the staff was polite. If I didn't know any better I would say the sandwich artists are getting a kickback on the vegetable savings. I had to ask twice for them to at least cover the bread with lettuce."}
{"text":"Good for Subway and the friendly sandwich maker at this location !!
Kudos for making a chain an all-people-friendly place !"}
{"text":"I walked into this very dark, shady looking location, and the Asian male counter person had an attitude right off the bat.  I said I'd need 4 foot longs but that I needed a few more minutes to decide. He said \"duh, when you make the very difficult decision of what bread you want, we can make your order\". I said excuse me?  He said duh again and pointed to the picture of the breads.  I was getting irritated with his extreme rudeness at this point and asked his name.  He said Jan.  I said \"I'm Going to a different location because you're too rude\".   Response?  \"Oh no. Bye\".    I drove down 88 to south park shops and went to Panera Bread. Then went home and wrote subway a letter.  I even took the little sh*ts picture.  I'll never return to subway. 
Pretty astonished at the kids rudeness, even in today's horrible customer service atmosphere.   He was truly the worst person I've ever encountered in fast food, and that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Some employees are nice, but the head manager rushes you, over upsells, and doesn't listen when you talk."}
{"text":"There are Subways everywhere, I know, but I like to escape to this franchise in particular.  It seems like their cookies are always fresh and I never fail to get a smile out of the staff.  Sometimes they'll throw avocado on my sandwich for free!"}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience at this subway. We nearly never go to subway anymore and this is why.
My daughter asked for mustard on her sandwich and she got mayo. When I told the workers that they put mayo instead of mustard one of the workers said to the other, \"Scrape the mayo off and put mustard.\" They didn't even scrape off all of the mayo. Btw my daughter was allergic to Mayo."}
{"text":"So after leaving the gym, I decide to pick up a sandwich for dinner at Subway. Turns out they had NO white bread left. The most basic type of bread. The only two options were wheat and honey oat. Just ridiculous! Now, I've frequented this Subway before and have never come across this problem. How are you the sandwich spot and run out of bread?? That's like the pizza place running out of pepperoni. UNACCEPTABLE."}
{"text":"Five stars for customer service. I came in and had a gift card to use.  My gift card did not cover my entire bill so I used a credit card.  There was an issue with the system where my gift card wasn't recognized and my credit card was charged for the full amount.  Employee Mason attempted to resolve the issue.  Mason could not resolve it, but contacted the owners and they advised him to refund me my entire bill.  I thanked him and asked him to thank his owners.  I did not expect this and will definitely be back to support this business."}
{"text":"A very dirty place. You can watch the employees picking the gunk out from between the bins with their fingers, and then watch them make your sandwich while wearing the same gloves. Another customer said something about changing gloves, and he was ignored. I walked out, and will never go back."}
{"text":"To tell you the truth, there really isn't much to say about a place like this.  You go in, place your order, they make it, you pay, you leave.  That's about it.  So that's how I'm going to review them.

It's located in a shopping strip that's kinda if inconvenience to get to.  You can't get to it directly traveling south on Hayden and even weirder is that you either enter the shopping strip from behind from an adjacent street or cut through a Circle K's entrance.  Once you do manage to get in and parked, you will find that the store has an odd layout with the sandwich counter being in the center separating the seating areas into two.  Let's just say, I would have laid things out differently but really, who really goes there to sit down anyway,

The counter there is the same as any other Subway counter you will find so no big surprises there.  What I will say about it is that it seems clean and the meat and vegetables always seemed well stocked and somewhat fresh.  The bread in there in full view as well, keeping it close by for the workers to be able to access them quickly when they are making these subs.  That lead's me to the making of the sandwiches.  Again, nothing too spectacular here either.  Everything is made according to a preset formula.  When you order a Turkey sub, they will put in a certain amount of meat along with a certain amount of cheese and move on.  Same goes for all of their choices.  There is no flair or originality here . . .it's all basically an assembly line.  What you see in other Subway's is what you will find here which is the point of a owning a Franchise so no complaints there.  I will say that you can personalize the sub to your tastes when you get to add whatever vegetables and dressing you want on it so there is that.

After that, they wrap it, they bag it, and try to up sell you on a meal which is a bag of chips and a soda.  From there you pay and either stay there to eat or go where ever.  That's it.  No much else.

So far, I haven't had a bad experience here though my expectations aren't very high to begin with.  Let's face it, it's a sandwich, how hard is it really to mess up?  I will say that most of the employees have been friendly and some going as far as learning my name and remembering me when I go in which is nice considering that they are more in a production atmosphere where quantity is the name of the game.

So to sum up, for a Subway, this one is pretty good.  It has it's issues with road access but makes up for it in cleanliness and speed once in there.  So if you are looking for a quick sandwich/sub or what ever you want to call it, this place is as good as any other."}
{"text":"Although I can't eat here due to dietary restrictions, I went in to pick up a sandwich for my mother. The store was clean and although there was a line, the service was fast. I was especially impressed with Chelsey who really was exceptional. She was super friendly and very helpful. Her positive attitude was noticed and appreciated.

I only took a star off because I myself didn't taste the food but my mom loved her sandwich!"}
{"text":"Bought some Lays BBQ chips and when I got home and opened the bag the chips were pure white and smelled like paint. Now I know this could be Lays fault but I brought them back to the store and they would not exchange. The chips are cheap and it is the principle. I will be gassing my 92' grand prix and hitting the road from this Sunway Gas stop from now on. Buyer beware. 1 star!"}
{"text":"One star is being generous.... people there are rude (especially the owner) and the main reason for the 1 star is for the fact that they do not make your Sub the way you like it. They get upset for asking for extra toppings and really try to rush you out..... also got I'll, May not have been from there but I'm not going back. Go to another location..... this one wasn't worth it"}
{"text":"Sign outside says open 24 hours yet I was just told by the employee they are closed until 4am. Horrible attitude as well. On second thought, the food looked like it was riddled with bacteria so maybe they saved me a night of praying to the porcelain god."}
{"text":"You can't even get a glass of water in this place with your meal. Don't make the mistake I did and eat at Subway in Las Vegas at store 22017-0 on the Strip in Casino Royale."}
{"text":"One time I ate here and someone had puked on the floor and the staff where so grossed out by it they refused to clean it up. So everyone that walked in walked right out. Meanwhile I'm sitting there eating and quickly wrapped  my sub up and left. That evening I called the company and they got the owner to call me he was apologetic but when I asked him for a coupon for the trouble he said sorry no can do. So there you have it need I say more."}
{"text":"Best Subway experience ever. The employees are super friendly and very professional.
I get greeted, thanked and presented with a sandwich that could be used in a commercial."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Subway with a super cool self serve pop machine that lets you have cherry Diet Pepsi."}
{"text":"Everytime I eat here I get the best service. There are two ladies working that I think I have worked there for a while, they are so sweet and seem to know a lot of the customers.  She once told me \"keep on smiling\" it was so sweet, it made my day and I still think of it. They also have a drive thru! They need to be recognized for their great service, it is definitely rare in this area!!"}
{"text":"Didn't open on time. Mapping software and sign on door said it opens at 9:00am. Arrived at 9:15am. Doors were locked. Girl behind counter didn't acknowledge the four of us waiting at the front door even though we had eye contact. She disappeared into the back. We started knocking. She finally came back to the counter area and gestured she didn't open until 10am. Such a waste of our time. Fortunately the Subway in the Walmart just a few blocks further south was open and took good care of us."}
{"text":"I see bugs flying in the food. I guess they can't do anything about that but it's unappetizing. Sugar cookies seem to have been discontinued. I don't like them to use bread that I saw sitting on the counter  when I came in. I want bread grabbed from the oven and cut my 6 inch from. And don't scrape the bottom of the container. Get a new tuna out. 
Other than that it's the typical Subway experience."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. You have to beg for a piece of lettuce or cucumber. Stingy on all veggies. Count all cheese and meat. For raising prices, I would drive an extra 10 minutes to go to Port of Subs or anywhere! ! I live 2 minutes from this location and would go anywhere but here. Owner needs to address this location if they want to stay in business."}
{"text":"The location is nice! But the service sucks! The guy didn't even make eye contact! He would not even look up at us for a second. He was very crabby! If you want a good sub and good service this is not the place.."}
{"text":"My mom got food poisoning from this place and they have the worst customer service the manager was a complete jerk when I tried to talk to him about it, I wouldn't recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Worst subway I've ever been to. Terrible service. The people working did not bother to wash their hands after helping the previous customers pay and making new sandwiches. They cut all the way through the bread causing my sandwich to completely fall apart after the first bite. You're better off driving to a different subway."}
{"text":"Great location and great subs if you are into healthy eating. I have to eat Subway once a week so I can be like Jared."}
{"text":"Subway sandwich shops seem to be located about every mile or two.  The experience at them is usually similar.  Not so with this location IMO.  The good: very clean dining area and the bathroom was also immaculate.  The problem for me involved the sandwiches.  

When I get a Subway sandwich, it tends to be a veggie dominated eating experience.  The franchises have those wax-paper pre-determined meat and cheese servings.  This one is no different.  But Subway sandwiches tend to be made with overflowing lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, etc.  This is the way that 99.9% of Subway sandwiches that I have ever eaten have been made.  Not so here.  I first had some doubts when I noticed 4 individual pickle slices being placed on my foot long sandwich. 

I did not want to be overly picky about pickles.  :-)  But the total amount of all veggies was underwhelming (I asked for everything minus like two of the choices, as I always do).  When we got home, my fellow sandwich purchaser and I both noted how bread was the primary taste of each bite of our respective sandwiches.  Again, Subway has always been know for meager meat/cheese portions, but it is made up for by the large variety of veggie choices.  Not sure about most folks, but I pretty much only keep lettuce and tomatoes at home, not various peppers, etc.  So I tend to choose just about everything for my Subway sandwiches.

Now, I guess that I could have asked for more veggies, but it would be the first visit at any Subway in which I would have had to ask for more lettuce, etc.  Maybe only the staff working around 4pm on Saturdays make the sandwiches this way.  But my guess is that the owner told them to cut back on sandwich toppings.  Not the end of the world, but I will just head down the road to another Subway the next time that I am driving down Bell Road and want  a sandwich.

If another veggie lover has a better experience here, please post it and I will give this location another try.  I really liked how spick and span clean it was."}
{"text":"I am in shock that a restaurant can operate without a restroom. Isn't there a law or something requiring you to have a restroom?  Will not be back. Just absolutely crazy."}
{"text":"I'm completely shocked that this place can operate without a restroom. The sign on the door to what appears to be the restroom states \"employees only\" no public restroom. Isn't that a health code violation?  Two behind the counter and apparently only one can operate the register and when the guy completed my order he had to go find the girl who just walked off. If your on the register and just checked someone out and could obviously see he was working on my order. Why would you walk off?!  It took her at least 5 minutes to reappear and and check me out. She starts with \"sorry I must have spaced\". Really?!?"}
{"text":"Worst subway i have ever been to workers had an attitude and were extremely rude and stuck up. Kyle and jules are their names and i do not recommend anyone visit this location EVER!"}
{"text":"I totally love this Subway location. It is one of the cleaner ones I have been in and I have had a lot of good experiences here. The owner is always around, totally nice and her employees seem to have some personality which is a plus for me. They are pretty much always busy, but I don't think I have ever spent what I would consider to be too long there in line. I completely accept that you always run the risk of a so so service experience when it comes to fast food, but I have had too many good experiences here not to write about it."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona for interview last Monday, June 4th and was happy to find this Subway close to the place I had my interview with.

Not the greatest Subway but not too bad either. I guess I lucked out receiving awesome service from the employees that were there during my visit.   I got my sandwich as I ordered it.

The place needs to be cleaned more often is what I'd recommend.  

Thank you for my yummy quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Roxy was making my sandwich and i noticed she wasn't wearing a hat or a hairnet, lucky i didn't have hair in my food.  She was also very rude and seemed short tempered when my debit card said declined.  she must have been rushing or trying to do it wrong, because a third time she slowed down and the transaction went thru."}
{"text":"I just got served by Hope and it was the best service and sandwich from Subway that I have ever had! She was the only one working when I came in and she still made sure that my sandwich is exactly as I wanted it. Super friendly,  it seems like she loves her job and it shows!  Someone give her a raise, she deserves it! 

As for the location,  it is new and clean. It's quiet with PLENTY of parking!"}
{"text":"The food is what you expect but the people working there are rude and mean to customers. Go to the one on the student union."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've had at a subway. We go in to get a couple sandwiches 30 minutes before they close, with no intention of staying to eat there. The two young ladies working were completely unprofessional and rude the entire time. We walk in, and immediately, instead of greeting us like you usually are when you walk into a subway, they stop midway in the conversation and just stare at us with disgust, making us feel extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome. After the girl behind the counter asked us what kind of sandwiches we wanted, they immediately start up their conversation again while the girl is taking her time making out sandwiches.. The girl also sneezed and didn't cover her mouth while she was wrapping our sandwiches up. Disgusting. 

Their conversation consisted of \"I'm going to go home soon, I'm so tired. You don't understand how tiring and rough it is to be 18\" If you thinking being 18 is rough, you're in for a rude awakening, especially considering the type of work ethic you appear to have."}
{"text":"So disappointed with the selections at this location! Jalapeño bread and Sriracha sauce are no longer offered...deal-breaker for me, especially when so many other locations offer it."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst subways I've been to. Ordered a chopped buffalo chicken salad and got about half the meat and half the vegetables that it normally comes with. I will absolutely never go to this subway again! I should have read the reviews before I went and I would have gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars. This is BY FAR the worst subway I've ever been to. The staff is rude and rush you or just ignore anything that you're saying. I asked them to not toast my sandwich and got a long sigh and continued attitude. The vegetables were old and soggy and don't even try to ask them to take something wrong off because you'll get yet another sigh and another full dose of attitude. Terrible service. Horrible food. I live less than a quarter mile from this subway but I am always more than happy to drive 5 mikes out of my way to go to a different one with better service."}
{"text":"I recommend the Ham & Cheese.  It cures the munchies.  That's it."}
{"text":"OK, unless you've been in a coma for 40 years you know everything there is to know about Subway.  That being said, each franchise/location can differ greatly in service and quality.

This particular location offers fantastic service, and has such long-tenured employees they have to have a PHD in sandwhich artistry.  If you could get above a PHD they would have this distinction.  I swear the same guy who was working here when I moved to the Valley 4 yrs ago is still here.

AND, right now (2/08/11) is $5 for any foot long.  Booyaa!"}
{"text":"Really clean place to eat! Good food and friendly people. Good location. Easy to get to off of the interstate and fun little town feel."}
{"text":"The girl in the morning is very rude. I wanted a small breakfast sandwich but she refused to make it for me at first and explained that \"you know it's this small right?\" Well, obviously I knew that! That's why I wanted it in the first place! Came here once, NEVER coming back again."}
{"text":"Food is like any other Subway. Sometimes the employees look a little sketchy but I've never had a problem. This location has one dude that keeps everything running, which is better than many other location."}
{"text":"Typical subway but close to every time I go in its some of the bitchiest workers I've seen"}
{"text":"Ive been coming in here quite often over the last few months. I think the staff is great and they make great subs. Today, I decided to try and use my Subway text specials. I get them every so often, but I dont always use them. The employee told me that the owner doesnt allow them. Sucks, cause now I have to find another Subway near me that does use the text coupons. Wonder if there are any other Subways near me that will take the text coupons ;)"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly place. Great service. Clean and tidy. They know about the new sub promotions."}
{"text":"Went to Subway for lunch 10-31-17. Have worked downtown for years and been to this Subway location many times. Received a Downtown Madison gift certificate which clearly states can be used at that Subway. Got to the register and the guy who was new asked the jerk with glasses next to him making sandwiches how he should handle the transaction. The jerk said \"we don't take those\" real quick and did not make eye contact.  The lady working took over to show the new guy to process it like a cash transaction. I got my change and that was that.  To the tall JERK W/GLASSES working there, lying wasn't necessary when CLEARLY Subway is listed as a particating business!  Obviously you DO take them!"}
{"text":"What a Awesome afternoon staff. Jackie was very energetic and personal. She made our food with smiles and asked all the right questions for me to come back as a continuous customer. Thank you Jackie!!! Hootie Hoo."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been to this Subway shop twice. The first time I heard it mentioned was by my older children who were upset by the service they received. They were treated rudely and ignored by the staff when trying to place their order. They actually skipped over them to serve another customer who was standing behind them. 

The last time I visited the shop it appeared dirty and I recieved a half bowl of cold soup . I paid for a full bowl of hot soup (chuckle) I returned to the counter to have my soup warmed up and asked for a full bowl (please) I was informed that it was all gone. I realized they scrapped the bottom of the pot instead of simply telling me they were out and offering an alternative. 

The manager is very abrupt and not very freindly. 2 x's a charm ..I will not return"}
{"text":"This is the worst  costumer service place from all the subway I have had bad experience and the food my 6 inch all soggy after I ask to put the ingredients and he dint put the meat and the cheese I request even telling him and he argued with me that it was their even when  I see he dint put it on bad never coming back"}
{"text":"This subway is awful. The crew is rude. I literally had to wait for them to finish discussing the recent firing of an employee for them to finish making my sandwich. Even worse is the managers piss poor attitude when dealing with complaints. She mocked me when I brought up the situation. I'd expect more out of a leader."}
{"text":"Today was the best service I've had in there for a while, Josh I believe his name was, IS AMAZING. Listened. Smiled. Said hello and goodbye and had some damn good personality. Thanks for my \"oil and vinegar\" sandwich! It was delish!!"}
{"text":"Several time this older lady has grabbed my food without gloves, she smells like cigarettes all the time. Several coworkers have become sick, all in all its disgusting"}
{"text":"Totally got abused today by a server on salads at the Craig Street Subway. What a controlling, intimidating man! I had to order the vegetables in some particular order, and then he yelled at me for not reeling off the vegetables all at once. He kept saying, \"don't pause...stop pausing, do not pause.\" And he corrected me for asking for the non-vegetables before starting and then finishing the vegetables. Wow. He's the Salad Nazi!"}
{"text":"Price is fine for a $5 foot long...but bread was undercooked. That's a first.

Bread was falling apart (Italian) and was not the same quality that I'm used to."}
{"text":"Quick service with friendly people. Clean establishment too. As always great subs and salads. My currant favorite here is their breakfast sandwiches! They rock! Especially after a great workout! Love it!"}
{"text":"First, when I walked into the store I was greeted by Erick from over the counter, he had a mouthful of food in his mouth munching it down. And then before preparing my sandwich I had to ask him to change his gloves for sanitary purposes since he had been using the same gloves to eat his food. He was offended by my request and he complained and tole me, \"they don't have any large size gloves, and it's hard for him to wear medium size gloves.\" Finally after he changed gloves and made my sandwich I told him to make my order \"to go\" and instead he charged me as \"dine in\" which is extra money with tax verse getting it \"to go.\" I'm never coming back to this store again! I was very I unsatisfied with the cleanliness of this store even the spinach on my Sandwich was old looking. Wow"}
{"text":"Standard Subway says it best. Seems clean everytime I go."}
{"text":"Service is slow when there's few people and being near the bus stop, they need to step it up for those in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Wow, the subway did not have great customer service. The food is ok but what makes it bad is when they do not treat you good and this subway needs a lot of help, maybe the person I had was not happy or something."}
{"text":"If they could give you a loaf of bread and call it a sandwich, they would. Seriously, the lack of veggies they put on the sandwiches, even when you ask for more, is sad. How much does shredded lettuce cost that you put a half a cup on a footlong veggie sub? Three thin slices of tomato, about 8 pickle slices. Next time I'll just eat my $5 bill instead."}
{"text":"Let me just say, in general I love Subway, always have. Used to work at one as a matter of fact, during my college days back in Austin - the one on the corner of 29th and Guadalupe next to Toy Joy, the best Subway EVER. 

The problem with Subway is the lack of consistency from store to store. The good ones can be really, really good - super fresh veggies, generous helpings, clean inside...  and the bad ones can be just as bad. Well, this one - the one in the Fry's shopping center on the southeast corner of Ray and Rural, is somewhere in the middle. Can't really rave or complain about any of those things.

What did bug me about this particular location were a couple of the employees who insisted on giving me a hard time for not eating meat - especially when I ordered the veggie patty. They made faces when pulling it out of the wrapper, ask me what was in it, get grossed out when I told 'em... and then pretty much challenge my quasi-vegetarian views, which wasn't really why I was there, you know? I just wanted my damn sandwich, no questions asked. Now, that being said, I do have to give them credit for even having the veggie patty on their menu in the first place, as not all Subways across the valley are considerate enough to do so..."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it one star is it forces you to give it a rating.  I went in this morning to order a simple breakfast sandwich.  The young gentlemen (and I am being nice) was EXTREMELY rude and condescending.  I requested a black forest ham, egg and cheese sandwich.  The server put the ham and cheese on the bread and proceeded to put it in the oven.  I stopped him and asked was he going to warm up the egg.  At that point he snapped at me and said \"I asked you did you want egg when I repeated your order so you must didn't get it\".  I said to him \"Excuse me...I did ask for the egg you must not have heard me\".  He then got rather flippant and said in a condescending manner \"Is this your first time at subway\" as he threw my meat on the bread on top of the eggs.  I was so angry I told him to cancel my order and walked out.  The customer behind me was also in shock as he stated quite loudly \"WOW what service\"  
I have worked in Ballantyne for many years and have never experienced such terrible service.  I plan to contact their corporate office to let them know the culture of this store."}
{"text":"My gf ordered a tuna sub from this location from some creepy sandwich artists. He gave her 2 skimpy scoops of tuna on a 6inch sub The tuna didn't even cover the sandwich. After that he used old tomatoes while the lady was putting out a fresh container of tomatoes. She only had one sub and it took a total of 8 minutes for this one sandwich. Will never go back to this location, this slow creepy young kid ruined it for me I will be taking my business to a different location and enjoying my fresh sandwich somewhere else."}

I had a bad experience I always go to this place because is always close to my job. Well when I when in there on Saturday employee named Omar (\"manager assistant\") was the one who served me well he did not greet me or anything like that but it was not new to me because all employees there look like if they don't like their job or something so I was like okay because maybe he was having a bad day so I started telling him what I wanted and etc but then every time that I would say something he would give me this face and I really got upset. He gave my sandwich to this girl who charged me and she was smiling etc when I paid I told him \" you have to give a better customer service because it feels uncomfortable\" well he got mad and instead of telling me sorry he started talking SHIT ! Because ppl like them talk SHIT ! Well I told him \" and you are assistant manager ? Wow what I great customer service !\" He answer me \" I don't give a fuck\" well we started arguing back and forth. I was like \"you don't have a mother kid because for you to talk to a women like that it's a meaning of no mother or maybe she did not reached you to respect a women\"  well he did not stopped talking and I ignored him completely!

{"text":"The worst subway I've ever visited. Staff terrible, food a disgrace to \"fresh\" and the whole place was so gross to even sit in. Never returning."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!!! Made a quick stop during a trip. They had no meatballs, no spinach and I kid you not - TOASTER OVEN OUT OF ORDER!! I wanted to leave but hubby was starving. Then we paid for our food and looked on the receipt and saw we were over charged. We pointed out the error and were refused a refund!! The older woman working said only her boss can give us our money back and we would have to come back or take a drink or chips we decided to go ahead and take the chips. When my husband was getting the tips the girl in the back I was just looking out on a while she was eating her dinner. Then we sat down and another man came in right before 8 o'clock and the girl refused to take his order because she said they had already closed.."}
{"text":"SUbway is regular but this particular one on st.clair is just terrible. I work close by so every now and then I go visit.

They just slap on a sandwich without any interest whatsoever. It always falls apart and they do such a terrible job that I feel I shouldve never gone there when I go to pay and had something else instead. 

been there about 4 times and I think I'm going to write it off. People if you want to enjoy your food go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick meal. Decent prices, neat and tidy."}
{"text":"this is a review of this particular subway but from an older experience, but i have never forgotten how disgusted i was.   

i went in one evening to get two foot longs.  

some kid was mopping the floor behind the counter with gloves on.  (you see where this is going?)

i ordered from a girl who was not mopping, then, she cut the bread for my order, passed it along,and walked into the back.  The red haired kid who was mopping then went directly from mopping to handling my food.  no washed hands, no hand sanitzer, not even a wrong attempt to change gloves, just obliviously went from holding the same mop they use to clean the bathrooms, a mop with an unknown brownish residue speckling the handle, possibly after using those same gloves and mop to clean the toilets, to (attempting) to make my food.   he smiled and asked \"what would you like tonight?\"   
 
first:  i don't give a damn how nice you may pretend to be,  if you are going to give me e-coli or salmonella or human feces on my turkey breast subs, you can go to hell.

ALSO:  if you don't realize that you shouldn't go from handling the same mop you use to clean up piss and feces in the bathroom to making food for human beings, you do not belong in any facet of the food industry.

i asked:  \"uhhhh, shouldn't you wash your hands and change your gloves after touching that mop handle and before making the food??????????\"....... his response:  oh, ha ha ha,  i forgot, ha ha.

he took off the tainted gloves after grasping the (now tainted) bread, grabbed the mop he had leaned against the food prep table and placed it against the wall near the hand washing sink and then rinsed his hands for 3 seconds with water (no soap or sanitizer), dried them on his dirty apron, then dug his hands into the box of gloves and fumbled with putting on some new gloves for about 30 seconds, contaminating them as well.  

at this point, i said \"oops, i left my wallet at home\" and walked out of there, probably sparing myself many, many hours of food poisoning symptoms, e-coli-poisoning, salmonella, or just the disgust of knowingly ingesting bits of human feces.  

beyond disgusting.  i have never eaten at a subway since, nor do i plan to in the future considering the type of people they employ.  (apparently, idiotic high school kids who just want a paycheck and have never even heard of food safety practices, or they just don't come close to caring about them when they're handling other people's food) 

...just something i needed to get off my chest, (i have had nightmares about the experience ever since)"}
{"text":"Normally, I wouldn't even bother reviewing a chain restaurant, but this one deserves it!! The bread was incredibly fresh and so soft. the employees carefully prepared my sandwich the way I like it and weren't stingy on the veggies. Maybe I just got lucky, but this is the best Subway I've ever been to, and I've been to quite a few!"}

{"text":"Literally hate this subway. Worst one I been too! The food is low quality, they served mine cold when I told them to toast it! The chicken was bad, I couldn't even finish my foot long when at other subways I need more than that to fill me up! Service is awful and impolite employees. I hope I never have to go back to this place."}
{"text":"My favorite subway so far! Food is high quality and fresh every time. The service is great too and they keep the place clean as well. The place however is smaller than others I been to. I love how they have the in store special meal too! I get the foot long Italian cheese bread, buffalo chicken with pepper jack cheese, some lettuce or spinach, jalapeños and to top it off ranch. Craving it as I'm writing this :)"}
{"text":"This is by far the best location to go to on campus. Friendly,fast, and great food! All the employees have a great attitude the manager at this location is really awesome and fast. It does get busy, but understandable it is a school and what else can you expect during lunch rush lol. Love the affordable menu $3 deals rock!!!"}
{"text":"It was clean and I liked that this one does not have that strong subway smell. The staff is a little unprofessional especially for the area it is placed in. They were in conversation with each other instead of giving full attention to the customer. But other than that not bad."}
{"text":"A Comment from the Owner:

I would like to thank all of our loyal customers for supporting our restaurant over the years. It is with a heavy heart that we regrettably inform you we have had to close this location due to the landlord's refusal to renew our lease.

{"text":"I have been coming to this subway during my lunch hour for over a year. The service use to be great but there was a staff change that occurred over 6 mths ago. They have never been very friendly, but today especially everyone had a bad attitude! Staff is very rude. Some of the workers were even  slamming doors and being rude to one another as well as to the customers. I don't recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"The dirtiest subway I have ever been to. I hope I don't get sick... I was the only one there while the guy working here was just in back talking on the phone instead of cleaning. Also,  the produce was old, dry and nasty. I wouldn't recommend this place if you were starving."}
{"text":"Have been to this location many times and always have had a pleasant experience. Today was no exception, had a great lunch, until I was ready to leave. One of the women making sandwiches appeared to be new. Just as I finished my lunch I watched her walk outside and have a cigarette break. When she was completed, she walked back in and went directly behind the counter and started taking orders. At no time did she wash her hands."}
{"text":"1 star because the place was clean.

The bad is that only 1 person was making the subs while the other waited at the cash register. Keep in mind there were 10+ people waiting behind me. The 2 teens working barely communicated. One more thing, they did not have any meatballs in stock. I ended up going home with no dinner for my son and wife. :/

Where's management to step in to get this place back up and running right.

Only reason they are busy is it's the nearest subway in providence!"}
{"text":"When it comes to food, I'm easy to please. It's almost as if a place has to go out of their way for me to be disappointed. This particular Subway had it in for me. 

I came in with one thing on my mind: Broccoli cheese soup. They didn't have it (it's seasonal, so that's fine), but they did have Chicken Noodle. Unfortunately, the lady helping me said her co-worker forgot to make the soup. Queue Price is Right failure trumpet.

I ended up getting a turkey sub on wheat. Not only were they stingy with the toppings and condiments, the meat didn't taste fresh. 

However, the customer service there is great. They were friendly and apologized sincerely for the soup ommision. I think great customer service can cover up a plethora of mistakes. 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"It's a sandwich, it's not a difficult thing to make. I asked for sweet onion sauce and I started paying, I get home to bite into my teriyaki sandwich and it's straight up vinegar. Employees at this location should be wearing safety helmets."}
{"text":"Disappointing service.  The guy behind the counter, JD, seemed to be bothered by having to make my sandwich.  Maybe they were flustered by too many people in line, but I felt like I was not welcome.

The energy here was not positive which I picked up on."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the service today. There was only one employee attending the customers with 4 waiting customers in line. A second employee finally started to assist after a long wait. Asked for extra chicken did not get it, vegetables were not so fresh and they barley wanted to put any sides on, had to ask for a little more. Took 25 minutes to get my order. No tip today and I always tip."}
{"text":"I came in Monday last week around 330 in the morning. Ordered an awesome club made by Mana.. Outstanding personality and promptness."}
{"text":"Most horrible experience I've ever had at a Subway. It was the afternoon, I came to grab a 6 inch Pastrami. They worker didn't greet me, just stared at me until I told him what I wanted. Then the cashier said he couldn't except my $10 bill that I just received grom the casino and suggested I go to the change machine, another inconvienence. They need some training because their customer service skills are lacking. I will not return this location ever again."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times for lunch over the past couple years. Their meat is pretty low quality but the bread & toppings are a step up. I can usually eat pretty healthy by getting a 6 inch turkey sub on wheat with a bag of baked lays. I tried their green tea with honey today & it was so yummy. This is definitely not my 1st choice when it comes to subs, but it's quick & convenient  so I'll most likely be making return visits."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this subway hundreds of times, last night I went for a late night snack and Anthony was great! He was so helpful, and so polite! Probably one of the best workers I've been in contact with at this location! Thanks Anthony you made our night!"}
{"text":"Everyone loves Subway!!! Pretty standard across the board. We frequent this location several times per month. Just visited today, however, and not pleased with the guys that are working. No hair nets and long stringy hair that is not pulled back or in a net. Safety and Cleanliness....losing points Subway! Get in there and get this corrected."}
{"text":"Great service, beautiful building! So grateful to have a subway in Vistancia!"}
{"text":"Nothing was ready/stocked for lunch rush! Employees either don't care about customers or don't know how to make a quick sandwich. They work at a ridiculous pace and have no communication. Pretty much suck at their jobs."}
{"text":"It took 10 minutes to make my sub and no one was in line. Only had 3 types of bread to choose from. Asked for honey and oats and half way through making the sandwiches, realized that she was using wheat. I'm not sure how that even was mixed up.. Dropped my sub into the chicken container.. the toppings were not even close to being evenly distributed on the sandwich... Sauce on 3/4 of the sandwich.. if I called them out for all of their mistakes, it would have been more trouble than worth.. only reason this review even gets two stars is because one thing is being accomplished as I eat my unappealing sandwich... My hunger is gone"}
{"text":"Slow almost painfully slow; one person working behind counter old manager lady with attitude. Go hear if u want to waste time waiting in line and dealing with workers who are annoyed by customers. No problem just take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very rude disrespectful drugged out employee! She started giving me an attitude and told me not give her an attitude when I asked if she can change her gloves because I'm allergic to tuna! Then she proceeded to ramble on about a guy named Tony, Sara who I don't know and did not care about just out of nowhere and the store owner Susan saying she allowed her customers to get ripped off by letting the employees  not properly cut vegetables and serve to customers for full price! which is against Subway policy standards! The whole video goes on for 4 minutes. It ended when she chased me into another store harassing me for my name and I told her that I would call the police on her for harassment. She left  the store unattended with other customers still inside when she came after me. She didn't have a name tag or a hat on so I couldn't get her name. Shame on you Subway! DO NOT EAT HERE!
***UPDATE****
 As of 4/28/17 the appropriate action has been take place against this employee and she has been  since fired. For her rude and inappropriate behavior."}

I already told him that I wanted the $6 meal special but at the register, he asked me if wanted the meal as I was saying that I'm getting the chips (as in I was choosing them as part of my meal), and only charged for the sandwich chips.  I asked him about my drink and he looked at me weird and indicated that I said I only wanted the sandwich and chips.  So, I told him I was choosing my chips in my meal and he then charged me the full price for a soda.  And during this time, he's talking with his coworker in another language. Rude af..."}
{"text":"In general I love Subway. I go to Subway about 4 times per week. This location however, is another story. One bathroom is disgusting with pee everywhere, and the other one is out of order. They obviously can't be bothered with cleaning the bathrooms. Makes you wonder how clean the rest of this location is. 

Very stingy with toppings. Poor service. Avoid this Subway."}
{"text":"\"No turkey, no spinach\" Seriously, this is the sign taped to the display case at this very moment. That sign though, did not deter several people from trying to order a turkey sub. When they were directed to the sign in front of them stating \"no turkey, no spinach\", they had hissy fits. That's besides the point. The point is, this place is out of turkey at 6pm. I think most people would consider turkey to be a pretty important part of sub, the spinach maybe not so much. But it gets better...when you go to pay and ask to add chips and drink you are then given the news that the soda machine is broken. No turkey, no spinach and no soda. What's next, no lettuce?  Warning, call ahead and make sure they have all the normal ingredients on hand before driving here."}
{"text":"Way over priced. Girl taking our order was extremely rude and pushy.  She did not even give us a second to think of what we wanted on our subs and gave an attitude as if we were holding back this big line. We were the only customers there!!! Avoid this piece of trash establishment. This place is a disgrace to the subway franchise."}
{"text":"Well run Subway location. Lots of staff at lunch time so you get through quickly. They have two credit/debit card machines so the cash is quick too. Food is subway, so you get a basic sandwich at a fairly cheap price."}
{"text":"It seems like every time I go there the customer service gets worse. Almost every time I go I end up buying multiple meals yet that doesn't seem to be enough to deserve some good customer service. A smile, a hey how are ya? Nothing. It's the opposite, they are rude and have nothing but snide remarks to give you. The saddest part is that the worse customer service comes from their manager. How do u expect your employees to have good customer service when their lead example is the worst one of them all.  I'm Glad subways are everywhere and I don't have to bring my business here."}
{"text":"I do not venture into a subway often but today I did.  Today was a particular day, I was working on a project with a group and I stopped in to bring back some lunch. Unannounced I walked in the Kings Square Subway and ordered 11 foot long subs at the end of a normal lunch time.   They seemed to be a little busy at the time and had a somewhat full store.  The young lady helping me, Brianna, was very helpful and kept a smile the whole time while making my large order. Another gentleman mentioned in the future that I could have called in my order to save me the time waiting.  It was a nice gesture and in hindsight I should have probably should have phoned in my order since it was so large. When they started to assemble my order they started to get very busy.  At this point I was feeling crappy since my order was putting everyone in the weeds.  Stepping back I watched while they put together my order all the while serving over 20+ other costumers.   Being in the restaurant business I appreciate their hard work and know what it is to be in a busy restaurant.  They handled it well and the manager (gentleman in the black shirt) held his team together and banged it out.   I was in and out in a matter of minutes with my large order and it was perfect.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I really like this subway specifically because the customer service is great and they are open late so I can eat fresh at any time. Also make my subs perfectly toasted every time."}
{"text":"My favorite subway by far it's open 24hrs a day for our coveniance so that we can eat fresh anytime. The customer service was awesome the workers were very friendly and professional. My sub was made perfectly and everything was fresh and exceptionally well."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent and they made my sub exactly how I wanted it. Everything was fresh and done right."}
{"text":"This subway has such excellent customer service. I feel like family every time I come here. I tend to get on people's nerves because of how specific I want everything and they never complain and always do it right."}
{"text":"WOW, I've been to a lot of Subways before, but this is the worst one yet. So, I order one of their featured sandwiches (the Turkey, avocado, and spinach sandwich). I tell the sandwich \"artist\" exactly what I want. He puts the turkey and cheese down and when it comes time for the veggies, fails to mention that he is out of spinach. I think that was an important overlooked detail that should've been mentioned at the beginning.. but okay. While he finishes making my sandwich, the MANAGER, starts ringing up the order. The artist forgets that it's a Turkey, AVOCADO, and spinach sandwich and has to add the avocado after I kindly remind him. After ringing up and paying for the order, the manager fails to add the avocado to the total and asks for additional money. I ask \"why\", the then start begins a very rude tone. As we walked out of the place, I hear \"...some of these people\".. I took a deep breathe and kept walking out.  Never going back here again. OH, and not mention that their credit card machine was out order and the lettuce was yellow. Just an absolute horrific experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean, never too busy, and the subs are not bad. That's all we can ask from subway, and I'm glad I have one close to home."}
{"text":"Due to several restaurants in the Mint Hill, North Carolina being without power this evening my wife and I had a late evening romantic dinner at Subway. Arriving at 9:00 pm we placed our order, took out food, and found a table. Just about the time I finished my sandwich, pushed back from the table, and took a big sip of my diet coke, the restaurant went dark. Looking across the darken restaurant, I said, \"Excuse me\" which caused one of the young ladies to look around the corner and say \"We close at 9:30.\" I told her that my wife was still eating, to which she repeated, \"We close at 9:30\" (yes she was blond and apparently thought that her being blond affected my hearing). I replied that closing time was when you stopped letting new customers come in, not when you turned the lights out on your customers. \"Oh, are you still eating?\", she queried. I tried to explain that my wife was still eating and that it was very rude to simply turn the lights out on your customers, especially without informing them that you were closing and going to turn the lights out. I thought about accidentally falling in the dark. I know some attorneys that would loved such a case and I have always wanted my own Subway. I told the young lady that I had never seen anyone so rude. At which she became magically polite and turned the lights back on so my wife could see how to toss her uneaten food in the trash can so that she would not have to clean the table. My wife, being the lady she is, gathered up her uneaten food and all the papers napkins, straw papers (even picking one up out of the floor - which I would never had done) through them all in the trash. Then, when my wife asked for her name, she disappeared in the back. 

So beware, if you decide to eat at this Subway in Mint Hill, and if you do, you had better be out by 9:30 or take your own candles!"}
{"text":"Came here last Friday at 9:50 and the doors were already locked so I decided to go through the drive thru instead since there is a huge banner outside that says \"OPEN TILL MIDNIGHT\". However all the lights were off and a young man was parked at the open drive through window with his window down as well. I stayed there for ten minutes hoping the young lady would be polite enough to stay open for the hours posted but she did not."}
{"text":"Hey Subway,

Don't be so stingy with the napkins. If I need an extra couple napkins, don't make me feel like a beggar.

I look forward to your cooperation in remedying the matter.

{"text":"We went with my husband and mother to eat on Sunday at 5:00 pm and the cashier was very rude a lady who mistreats her co-worker and clients should not be a cashier.

Subway needs to train employees to be more friendly to customers"}
{"text":"On several occasions I've gone in a few hours before closing and they were out of multiple items. Aside from that, they have some good deals and the food is pretty fresh."}
{"text":"After reading previous reviews, I assume they must be under new management. This is the only location in town where ingredients seem fresh, and they are always well-stocked. It is also the CLEANEST Subway I have ever been to- by far, and the two owners are fantastic! They are always quick and professional. 

We drive across town to come to this specific location now!"}
{"text":"I went here one night to grab a quick bit after work , and the customer service sucked . I normally go to this subway and receive great service, but that wasn't the case the night I went. I got a vague \" welcome to subway\" from Krystal (it's a guy). it's seemed like he hated his job. He didn't really speak to me, except when he asked what i wanted on my sandwiches . I got a footlong, then I changed it to a 6inch, he dropped my bread inside the speed rack an continued to make my sandwich with it ( ewwww), he then added very like toppings on my sandwich. I was very disappointed. I also ordered the meatball sandwich, and I was told by Krystal that it would be 10min cause the meatballs weren't ready. So i waited. He put them in the microwave for maybe 3mins, then started to make my sandwich with it. I don't even think the meatballs were ready since he said it would take 10min. When I ate my sandwich the meatballs were barley warm...."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location a few times and it had not been too bad but on my last visit I nearly broke a tooth on my food. Several pieces of tile were hidden in my sub. Maybe don't eat here."}
{"text":"Dried out bread, dried out tasteless meatballs. Diet Coke comes out of regular Coke fountain.  Worst Subway I've ever been to."}
{"text":"If you're going to offer a promotion be ready for the customer flow. If you run out of product, have a back up. Saying we are out of that style of chicken and will not offer any other type such as rotisserie is bs. Especially when I was lookin forward to this and ran over after work. Thanks for the disappointment"}
{"text":"This subway is awesome the people working here a very friendly and even if im.having a bad day they make it better. The manager is awesome and has a strong crew with him. I didn't know what i wanted and asked for a suggestion and he made it and nite was very very good.."}
{"text":"No problem with the restaurant itself, but unfortunately it has a manager or owner with an attitude problem. Two young employees are in store trying to keep up with the dinner crowd and the manager/owner walks in and immediately starts griping in front of customers. Doesn't say hi to any customers, but immediately starts arguing.  When she eventually does step in to help she is pretty short with the customers like we are inconveniencing her for giving her store business.  I'll keep that in mind when I decide which subway I go to next time....  a thank you would also be nice."}
{"text":"I'm going to freely admit that I love Subway. It was my first job as a teenager, and even seeing how everything's made - the frozen breadsticks that become sandwich bread, the mixing of tuna with copious amounts of mayo, etc. - I'm still a fan.

BUT, this is the worst Subway ever (and also, unfortunately, the closest to my home). The owner is to blame. The people working there are very nice, and are simply instructed to do the owner's bidding. Last night, I went in to use a Subway text offer (I've done this twice before because the offers are sent weekly). I ordered two footlong tuna sandwiches - identical in every respect because I planned to eat one for dinner and one for lunch today (I'm 7 months pregnant... lay off). I pull up the offer on my phone which states, in no uncertain terms, buy one sub and ANY fountain drink, get second sub free. Here's where the problem began:

1. Cashier asks coworker if they accept the coupon. Coworker says (in Spanish so I'm relying on cashier's translation) they can only offer to give me a 6\" sub for free. I point out that offer says nothing of the sort - the only restriction is that the second sub has to be \"equal or lesser value.\" Considering I got two identical sandwiches, there should be no issues.

2. Cashier says she doesn't have the ability to ring in the free sub on her register. That's not my problem.

3. Cashier says owner told them they were not to accept these \"free sub offers\" any longer. That, again, is not my problem. I tell cashier I will not attempt to transact business with this Subway in the future, but there's still the matter of two tuna sandwiches on your counter that you don't want to eat and I refuse to pay full price for.

4. Cashier rings up two tuna sandwiches without the drink and looks at me, pathetically. I'm getting a little annoyed at this point - it's been about 10 minutes of back-and-forth at the register.

5. Cashier finally rings in ONE footlong tuna sub and the medium drink. She apologizes for the previous ten minutes and I immediately forgive her. The cashier is making minimum wage and has to act as the messenger for the deranged owner.

6. The tuna tasted fishy.

Under new ownership, I'd be back in a heartbeat. But since it's unlikely I'll ever know if or when the ownership changes, I can safely say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Updated my review from 4 stars to 5. Today I was greeted by Victoria and Eric. I ordered a 6 in tuna sandwich on white bread. They both apologized to me for running out of white bread as they were really busy earlier. They did tell me they just made some but were too hot to serve. So i opted for wheat bread instead...no biggie. Victoria then advised me they just ran out of tuna and offered to make a fresh batch if I didnt mind waiting. Again, no biggie (she was nice enough to offer to make fresh tuna vs forcing me to choose another option...Thank You Victoria! Much appreciated :) )...I was thankful because I really wanted tuna! While I was waiting Eric was nice enough to tell me about their breakfast menu and delivery using GrubHub. After Victoria whipped up my sandwhich, Eric suggested to try honeymustard on my sandwich and boy oh boy! It was even more yummy! Thank you Victoria and Eric for going above and beyond! Subway is lucky to have you both :)"}
{"text":"I love subway but not this one!
- Not all customers are treated with the same respect at this subway.

{"text":"I will never go this subway again. It was Monday night and I paid for the sandwich and cup of water. The fountain pop machine is next to the where you pay the cashier. The guy (cashier) standing next to the fountain machine told me that make sure you don't hit the back of water as it dispense Lemonade even though I was filling cup with \"Water\" and he could see it. I believe his name starts with \"Y\". 

I asked him have you seen me filling lemonade and why would you say that to customer when I am not doing it. He said that he can say anything to customer and its his right. I asked him for his Subway Owner number and he mentioned he is the owner and he refused to give it to me. I know he is not the owner and just an employee. I was so mad why would you say to customer like this. This subway has the least professional employees and the girl who made my sandwich kept complaining that owner called him to work and she is not supposed to work that day. You don't talk to customer like this....I would have given zero stars to this location."}

There was not a single time that I went over there without being ignored. The employees look dirty and create a very negative and unpleasant atmosphere. DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"I'll admit that this location is extremely efficient and fast with the prep and the service is decent. The downside is that they do not participate in the $5 footlong monthly promotions anymore. I didn't realize that this was even an option for Subway restaurants! 

Needless to say, I was beyond disappointed when I found this out after stopping at this location."}
{"text":"Went to subways today 11-10-14 to buy four subways.  A kid was helping us then a white guy came over to help him.  Without asking us what we were having (because there was different breads there), the man assumed he knew what the subway on that bread would be.  My husband corrected him and he just seemed so irritated.  He roughly snatched the cold cuts and threw it on the other subway.  He kept shoving our  4 subways around (roughly) as the other 2 workers were trying to complete them and as he was trying to make other customers subways.  I've never had such rude service and I regret not walking out the store.  The store was previously owned by a Filipino (or Asian) family that always gave EXCELLENT customer service.  These owners hire people who do not want to work here.  We were not rude in anyway except I started getting very annoyed at how rude this man was which put me in a bad mood.  I told my husband NEVER again will we give this shop any business and it's the reason we had not been there for a while.  It's just shocking that you do the shop a favor by giving them a business (4 subways) and they treat you like crap because of that."}
{"text":"Went in today to buy 4 sandwiches.  A younger guy was helping us out and then an older white male came over to help him out.  Without even asking, he assumes what kind of subway will be on the bread (we had 2 types of bread).  My husband corrected him politely and the man just got so annoyed which he displayed with his actions (stopped in his tracks looking at us like we were speaking a foreign language like. . . how dare we!).  Then he roughly snatches the cold cuts he put on the bread and throws it on the other bread.  He then kept flinging our breads to make room for the next customers behind us.  We really should of walked out but we were trying to not let this ruin our day.  I was appalled by his actions as we were giving his store business (a good thing) and we were treated like crap like we were doing a bad thing giving his store business.  Uggh.  Anyhow, it used to be owned by a nice Asian family that ALWAYS gave great service but I think the store changed owners and the service is now HORRIBLE.  Will NEVER go back there again."}
{"text":"I come here quite often because it is 24 hours. And too the man who said most are, no you're wrong. 

Anyhow. The night guy is super awesome, helpful, and nice. 

I'm here now on a Saturday at 4pm. After leaving another subway because they only make cookies once a day and i wanted chocolate chip delicious morsels with my sandwhich, i drove here. (Knowing if they dont have cookies theyll make them). 

I come in and no one says anything, no acknowledgement, no hello, no \"be right with you\"

I stand waiting (they were filling a big order. Probably a catering im assuming. Still no one said a word. Two other ladies walked in... Silent

I asked if they could make some more chocolate chips and he said no we cant. 
(Theyre 24 hours and have to make them) 
The chick said. Yeah give me 10 minutes. 


Finally the young guy asked what I wanted. I said turkey and double american on an italian herbs n cheese footlong. 

He puts 4 turkey slices on (its supposed to be 8) and moved on. 
I asked \"isnt it supposed to be 8 slices of turkey. He said \"yeah\"

Ummm can i get ma damn turkey please? 
Then he only put four pieces of cheese on (i asked for double) and then i asked again. He said \"i dont know\"

The woman behind me told him it was supposed to be more cheese.
Then he started making her sandwhich and left me. 

That woman told him to do mine. And he said \"yeah butt\" 
And someone else came to help. 

Anyways. I got everything and it tasted good. Still waiting on the cookies. 

I also noticed on the catered items theyre sooooooo stingy with items. Usually you get 3/4 lettuce and 1/4 other. With the catered sandwhiches they probably had 10 shreds of lettuce on there. Pretty weird and gross looking."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of the best Subways I've ever been to. They always greet you warmly when you enter -- \"Hi, welcome to Subway!\", are very fast & professional.  The only things that could be better is that sometimes when one worker may start your sandwich & then \"pass it on\"/leave it for another worker to finish while they start the sandwich for the next person in line, sometimes that is just inefficient & the customer ends up waiting much longer than they would have if just 1 person finished that order.  The other thing I would change is that there is too much mayonnaise in the tuna.  But other than that, this place is excellent -- very friendly & great food!  :-)"}
{"text":"I went to this Subway on my break at work to pick up a meal for me & my co-worker. My co-worker wanted a large water with their meal and told me to tell the person working for a water cup (since water cups are free). I bought my co-worker what they asked for and brought it back to them only to freak out when we saw the receipt. The guy at this Subway charged me $2 for a WATER cup, which I specified was for WATER. Very angry, my co-worker called the Subway only to have the same guy answer the phone and blame ME, claiming I never said the cup was for water (which is BS, I specified numerous times that I wanted a water cup, FOR WATER). REAL clever, Subway. My poor co-worker never got their $2 back. Overall, loser staff & not really clean. I wouldn't overspend here again."}
{"text":"I am only writing this in hopes that the owner/manager will see this and make some changes.  I am giving it 1 star for the food safety practices in this store.  One time I went and there was just one guy working.  He never changed his gloves from one sandwich to another, and more disgusting, after using the cash register! Gross!  Gloves do not make things sanitary if you are touching everything with them! Then while I was eating, and the only one in the store, he went outside to smoke!  When the next customer came in, I saw the employee follow him in after he tossed his cigarette, and then I watched as he just went back behind the food counter and just put on some new gloves, not even bothering to wash his hands after being outside smoking! I was so grossed out.  The next time I went there, I hoped they would have different employees, but it was still the same guy. Once again I watched as he never changed his gloves after using the register and from sandwich to sandwich, and money exchanging.  Not only that, but there was a huge puddle of water by the drink dispenser that no one was bothering to clean up.  they just had a caution sign. I tried to get a drink, and I kid you not, I stepped in about a half inch of water that seeped through my sandals and got my feet wet.  Finally that same employee went to go \"clean\" it up.  which meant he used a disgusting mop with black water to sop only some of the water up, and then he just left the disgusting mop and bucket just sitting there! And once again, after \"cleaning\" up the water, I watched him go straight back behind the counter, and put on a pair of gloves, NO HAND WASHING AGAIN! I wonder is there ANYTHING that could inspire this employee to wash his hands before handling food? I will definitely be skipping this Subway location from now on, unless I hear they get their food safety practices up to par with where any restaurant should be."}
{"text":"Order an double meat Italian bmt, and later find out that they charged for double meat but didn't actually  double the meat..."}
{"text":"The store was clean & they are very generous with the toppings! Artajah was real sweet, we will definitely be back :))"}
{"text":"Pretty crappy service, the employees are rude. One uses the same gloves all the time. They always tell you AFTER you order and finish and get to the register that their credit card machine doesnt work. Then they dont apologize about it. Horrible place to go dont waste your time or money just find a different one to go too. I've been coming here for years (its close to school) and ive never had good service"}
{"text":"The logo should be \"subway don't eat fresh \" seriously when ever I eat there meat ball subs as if I were to eat cardboard."}
{"text":"This location has become terrible. I asked for tomatoes. The \"artist\" cut ONE slice of tomato in half. I asked for green peppers, I literally got 1 strand that she snapped in half to spread evenly across my sandwich. Prepared with the knowledge she was being stingy. I asked for EXTRA onions and I was given 3 thin strands. She even took the time to separate the strands to make it appear like I was given a full serving.

I had to ask for extra green peppers and onions two times before I was given the proper serving.

Then when I went to pay with card, the debit machine had a connection error and attempted to use dial up. The other \"artist\" was chattering away on the land line so naturally the dial up connection attempt failed. I tried to explain this to the cashier but she got confused and did a hard restart on the entire system. The system didn't restart properly resulting in me waiting 10 minutes while she resolve the system issue."}
{"text":"I had such an awful experience. I was in line for about 20 minutes with only 2 people in front of me. The employee, Jelsy, moved so slow. I was about ready to throw my friend over the counter and have her make my sandwich for me. Let me make a note that Jelsy left in the middle of making my sandwich to perform another task and proceeded to make my sandwich before switching gloves! I wasted my time and money."}
{"text":"I agree with other two reviews. Worst subway ive ever been to.  I asked for tomatoes and the indian lady put on 3 freken tomatoes. I literally had to ask for more topping on each item 2 or 3 times before it had a regular amount.  They wont give more than 1 napkin and literally cut the subway wrapper in half for 6 inch sub . Cheap filthy indian service and cleanliness.  If I could give 1 star its too much."}
{"text":"Was a great location. Have been going to this Subway for about six-months since I relocated back to Chandler. It was about half way from my office and home. Usually stopped in once a week. Last visit was on 12/14/2017 and they were out the Italian Herbs & Cheese Bread. Odd, never had a Subway 'run out of bread'. Went back there on 12/21/2017 on my way home from work and discovered the location has closed. The sign is gone from the building as well windows. Looking inside the entire front section has been cleared out. Not sure when during this past week they shut down. There was not even a \"Notice of Landlord Re Entry\" or even a 'For Lease' posted on the door as if they had just vacated in the past couple days."}
{"text":"Food is consistent, but the service... The lady who works during the week is sweet, but the man(her husband I think) is rude, never smiles and on several occasions when I came in, was on the computer, watching a movie and the volume was crazy LOUD!!! He did not turn it down when he saw me come in. Needs to get some manners."}
{"text":"I love this subway! I came here once on a trip to Las Vegas and walked in to find the place very clean with satisfying and healthy food as subway always has to offer! The only thing to complain about was the temperature. It was really cold in there, which made us want to get out quickly and stand in the sun. Really recommend you bring a jacket!!:)"}
{"text":"The Indian guy that owns the place stands at the counter and gives his staff evil looks if the put too much in the sandwiches.  Bit of a joke honestly.  I ordered a foot long and it only had 4 slices of meat.  Had to complain to the parent company as it was basically a bread sandwich for 8 bucks.  They're not even meeting subways minimum content standards as the owner is so busy policing his margins.  If subway were a half decent co, they'd revoke this guys franchise.  Save ur money and go to the burrito place next door.  3x  the food and much better quality for less money."}
{"text":"Thanks for your time to read this. 
I had walked in to a subway restaurant which is located in the south east corner of western and 401. 
Employes were just standing around talking to each other in there native language, didn't care about the costumers. One employ was coughing all over the station. No hair net. Talking to fellow employees and spitting all over food. 

Worst experience ever! Never going to a subway joint ever.

{"text":"Employees have no sense of customer service and God forbid you ask of anything that inconveniences them. Stay away from this location if you really want subway. These people should be grateful they have jobs. 

Ask for mayo on the side and be sure you define regular mayo. Otherwise they'll give you light because it's too much effort to squeeze the regular stuff into a container. 

Want to split a sub and get two different 6 inches on a coupon for a foot long? Any other location will happily take your request into consideration. For this location. It again comes down to being too much effort.

Let's put this location out of business and give someone a job that values it."}
{"text":"Never go to this location!! Lady was extremely rude, when I wanted to go to the washroom before I ordered, she told me I had to order first before I went to the washroom. Very poor customer service by the short haired lady, very cheap on vegetables as well. Go to any location but this one for your own good."}
{"text":"Subway is ok.its not wonderful, but its ideal for a snack and is even better than falling into a greast kebab shop after a night out. Fortunately, because it stays open late, this particular branch of Subway affords you that luxury.


 Prices are pretty reasonable, and theres always a variety of breads to choose from to go with the range of meats and vegetables and so on which go in them. There are certainly things you can get in Subway which are original - the recent limited edition reggae reggae chicken sub and the famous meatball marinara spring to mind as disctinct examples of this. Plus, because you can pick and choose what you want in your sandwich, it saves you picking out thibgs as you'd have to if you bought pre packed sandwiches from supermarkets etc.


 Staff here are helpful and efficient at their jobs, and it never seems to take very long to be served and out the door. the food is generic, but it can be quite tasty if you're in the right frame of mind."}
{"text":"I feel so regret on myself..that why i had not seen these people's reviews on yelp's..my only mistake was i guess ive order food from the app called \"SEAMLESS\".ive never had order from that app before,and the experience i got that had made me, not just writing reavive on SEAMLESS app but had SPECIALLY made me to download YELP in my phone just to write a review about them..igivewasn't swear if i had seen yelpers reviews first,i wasn't  gonna order from them,but i guess just just got another 1 star from me as well.in my case ive ordered for delivery about 2 hours ago at 10:38 pm and after long wait at 12:15 i contact the\"SEAMLESS\" app customer service center to find out about my order..they put me on hold for a minute to find out where the issue occurred.and the answer i got from them was that ,when the driver went there, the subway was closed already.i was like WTF...seriously  you gotta be kidding me..they said they will send me discount coupon code in email,which i dont want it,and they will refund my money.which im not give leave it. I never want anything like this about any buissness, but this place need to be shut down and i dont know how could a health department not taking any actions..i definitely wanna got there in person, not to order,to see what i can do to have them shutdown."}
{"text":"Felt compelled to review (and add to Yelp!) this Subway as this chain varies a lot in terms of quality and service across its numerous locations - moreso than with most chains, in my opinion.

The staff here in my local Subway are friendly, pleasant and efficient. The ingredients always seem fresh - something that is definitely not the case in a lot of other Subways.

There are hardly ever any lines despite its optimal location at Queen/Broadview. In fact, most of the time when I go in, I'm the only customer there. Maybe chain restaurants suffer in this area full of independents?

There's free wifi (again, this isn't the case in all Subways) and the washrooms are well-kept.

I'm a Subway fan and I always enjoy coming here. I inevitably finish my sandwich satisfied and happy that I spent my money well. This hasn't always been the case in other Toronto Subway locations where so much can be hit and miss. (NOTE TO EVERYBODY: DON'T EVER GO TO THE SUBWAY AT PEARSON AIRPORT!!!)

A solid four stars. I do wish they would sort out their opening times, though. They opened an hour later than expected on a recent Sunday when I was craving a Subway breakfast. Devastating!"}
{"text":"Great customer service !!! Food is fresh. Manager is so friendly and customer service oriented!!"}

{"text":"i used to not be a very big fan of Subway in-general, but ever since the $2 cold cut combo and meatballs subs in December i have come to love their subs, but the thing is, i have been to several other subway restaurants in phoenix/Scottsdale and the experiences were sorta bad (and I'll get to them in their own review), but of the 10 times i have been to this particular location i have had no issues other than it being 4 miles away from my house

Pros: Fast, Friendly service, open 24/7, fresh ingredients, food tastes great

Cons: other than the location inconvenience, none whatsoever

Conclusion: If you like great tasting subs for a great price i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone, and also if you have a bad experience at another location don't blame them all, because their are good locations such as this one!"}
{"text":"This Location is closest to me being less than a mile away from my home, but my past experiences has me driving 4 miles to tatum and bell for the 24 Hour location (also because of their amazing service and good food)
every time i have been to this location it has been a bad experience especially with employees who have terrible accents and are very hard to understand in-person or through the drive-thru window which gets very frustrating on my end and on there end which has even led to one of the employees talking to me like i was a baby which i was very unhappy about plus with the drive-thru window the service inside and out is slow as hell, and as for the food, it's always wilted and looks as though its been sitting out for awhile without being changed. as for the drive-thru, the audio quality at the crappy looking menuboard is awful, almost impossible to communicate through causing confusion, and frustration amongst the customer and the employees

pros: it's subway, close to my house

Cons: Service quality is bad, and the employees are hard to understand and are extremely impatient as well as unfriendly, the drive-thru audio quality is impossible to communicate through. food is gross looking, and taste is not far behind. 

conclusion: i would definitely not recommend this location to a friend but if you absolutely had no choice i guess you could always put up with the crap the employees dish out in-store and in the drive-thru"}
{"text":"I guess it depends on the time of day.   On May 10th 2014 4 pm totally horrible as far as the cleanliness.   Every table need to be wiped down.   Management should be embarrassed with the condition.   Staff not too friendly."}

{"text":"I've never had such a bad subway sandwich plus the guy behind the counter kept disappearing I saw at least 5 people walk away thinking they were closed! He put an overpowering amount of sauce on my sandwich and he rushed me the whole time. Plus I am pretty sure the meat was bad on the sandwich. The worker is still in the back just missed customer number 7!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.  Perrish dropped the knife on their dirty mats and continued to use it.  Trying to avoid being rude i kept to myself as it was used already for my sandwich, so the person behind me had to deal with the consequences, but who knows how many times the knife was dropped before my visit.  I was asked what kind of cheese, i told him no cheese, thanks. When i was rung up, i was charged .40 for extra cheese.  All the tables were clearly neglected.  I will never go back. As a subway enthusiast, i was more than disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"It wasn't very busy; my order was fast. Ingredients fresh. The service was good. The place was clean."}
{"text":"The line really felt like it was 30 min if not longer.  and yes it's $11 for a foot long.

It was the worst subway sandwich put together.  I watched the guy butcher the bread with his dull knife and sloppily placed the cold cuts and other toppings on top.  It was a mess.  An expensive mess.  I thought it was a good idea to stick to what I know but I was wrong.  If you are in a hurry, skip this place and get something else.  Don't want you to miss your flight!

not only that, their toaster oven was out of order!! ughhhh"}
{"text":"Chris and Josh were really fun! No monotone action, they treated us like we were the only customers in the entire store! This is by far the best customer service I have ever had in a restaurant! Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"Do you like decomposing lettuce? Me neither.

When it came time to put veggies on my sandwich I noticed that their lettuce was rotten. I asked if they had fresher lettuce (not that I should have to). The worker told me \"no, this is it\" and then proceeded to fluff the lettuce in the bin, apparently hoping there would be non-rotting lettuce at the bottom. There wasn't.

Rather than get mad, I took the ridicule route. After being told \"no\", I just stared at the rotten lettuce and laughed mockingly. The worker got ashamed or at least uncomfortable and went to the mini fridge. Lo and behold. A fresh bin of lettuce was in there.

So I got my normal, fresh lettuce, but those that came after me didn't. The worker kept the rotten bin out.

The whole time this worker made the sandwich, she was lamenting to her co-worker that the Walmart wouldn't hire her until after she worked at Subway for six months.

I wonder as I write this why I didn't just walk away. It's been several hours since I ate it and I haven't felt nauseated. So I guess overall it was a win. Won't be returning though."}
{"text":"Best subway I have been to.  The two young guys working were very polite, made no complaints and washed their hands after every order. Also used gloves."}

{"text":"I'm in search for the best Pastrami in Las Vegas. First stop Subway. I ordered the 6 in. Pastrami. The portion of Pastrami was small compared to add ons. The meat lacked flavor, even the jalapenos I added had no heat. So, no suprise here."}
{"text":"Not sure how someone can screw up a subway, yet here we are. Stingy servings, the oriental woman behind the counter is miserable and actually took ingredients OFF my sub and put them back in the trays. Don't visit this location."}
{"text":"During my time laying around the house, I decided that I wanted to go out and get some good food at a reasonable price. After reviewing my current funds in my wallet, I decided to take a trip to the nearest Subway. For those slight few who do not know, Subway is an actual restaurant that leans more towards the fast food side than a formal restaurant. Compare it to McDonalds or Burger King and you get a significantly more healthy place to chow down. 
       The menu offers plenty of choices to choose from, such as regular lunch meats to chicken prepared in different ways. If you like a good variety of sandwiches or subs, this is the place for you.
        I have had Subway a couple times to say the least so I wanted something different. There are numerous combinations to make a sub with so I asked the employee to make one of his for me. I figure that someone who works at this establishment must eat the food and would know some good combinations to make. The sub he made me can be described as delicious and satisfying. It was also very spicy. It was a buffalo chicken with pepperoni and bacon combined with various vegetables. I got a fountain drink along with it, the usual Coke product that the Subway carries. Sadly, one of the downsides to this was the price.
        I remember a couple years ago when the most expensive sub was around $6.50. The $5 menu was so much bigger; I wanted to go to Subway more and more because of the great deals. Now the prices have risen over a buck-and-a-half for some subs and it just doesn't seem worth going there as much anymore. 
       I understand that it is business and prices raises have to be made. If the sub artist does a good job with making a neat, organized sub, it makes the price a tad bit more reasonable. When the sub comes sloppy and messy, the sub just seems over-priced sometimes. Price and all, it is still a good place to find various kinds of healthy meals. Make sure to watch out for the sauce though because it is not all healthy there."}
{"text":"I am not too happy with their service. There is always 2 people working behind the counter and they are sooo slow! The 2 times I have been there, they have screwed up my order."}
{"text":"The two ladies who worked Sunday morning were absolutely pleasant and provided great customer service."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8:40 pm and were told they were already closed. The hours say open til 9 pm but the worker there said \"not tonight.\" So don't expect them to be open during business hours I guess.  Jersey Mike's got our business...."}
{"text":"Convinent location, horrible customer service. My sandwich is either burnt or so sloppy it falls out. Sandwich preparers side conversations are loud. During peak hours not enough coverage for amount of people. Cashiers are usually somewhat happy to be there."}

I stood at the register for a good 3 minutes before the woman sweeping back behind the counter was prodded by another employee to ring me up. She was extremely rude and not friendly at all. She even slammed my friends change down on the counter when she rang him up after me.

I used to work at a Cold Stone and I get it, the food industry isn't fun. But there's no reason to be rude without just cause. 

We came here to avoid the OTHER subway at the Phoenix Center which is a joke sandwich AND service wise but now I don't know which is worse!"}

Wish all restaurants were like them! I would highly recommend them. They can handle the larger orders with a smile!"}
{"text":"Treated very poorly with atrocious customer service by the associate named Rodina. Gives every customer a hideous look with her face and attitude. Not clear to the customer and tries to get us out of her face. I told her I want the 6 inch sub of the day and she grabbed a 12 inch sub, so I politely said, \"I wanted the 6 inch\" (Just to make sure) and she vulgarly looked up at me while rolling her eyes at me and said, \"I know\" It left me a bitter taste in my mouth being treated so rudely at a subway cafe on my campus."}

Instead of helping me through the line she screams off the top of her lungs,to the back of the kitchen, for a nice young gentleman to come help me. \"Can you come help this young lady out please!\" Umm hello, your not doing anything, and that was rude of you to adress your employee like that.

{"text":"Nothing special it's just a Subway. You can actually make the sandwiches at home but decided not to because you're too lazy to do so. NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. Happy Eating."}
{"text":"Very very bad customer service. I have been in many Subway locations, guys at this particular place are a shame on subway brand. 

The one that works at night, even refuses you during store hours. He is always closing 15 minutes early, but leaves the open sign on. Just tells customers that he decided to close early. 

Politeness is something he never heard of it, I guess. No hi, no hello, no thank you, NOTHING!!! He must be out of customer service world all together!!!

Now these days, I don't even bother to go in there. Who wants to give such a store business.

I will suggest that you also do the same. Lots of places to go in that plaza."}
{"text":"I went to the 75th an Thomas location today with my sister on our lunch break. And we were greeted by TJ. He was amazing the whole time we were there. It was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I don't know what was lodged so far up Justin's ass tonight, but whoever manages your subway needs to talk to that boy about respect. I ordered a turkey bacon guac, and he slaps raw bacon on my sandwich. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware of the limited people who are willing to work overnight at a subway, but I mean come on, have some standards for your hiring process. Like any human with a brain in my head, I asked to have my bacon microwaved. From that moment on slim shady coped a nasty attitude with me. He literally slammed the microwave door. Watch out everyone, we've got a tough guy over here. Apparently I had made his job so overbearing that he had to display his undying teenage angst. Then the tip on the iceberg was that he had to go open a new thing of guacamole. Man, what a tedious sandwich. First, he had to lift bacon into a microwave and press a button, now he has to cut open plastic? My god, what a hard life. He finally came back after a questionable amount of time preparing pre-made guacamole, I'm sure I ate some spit tonight, and he then slammed the guacamole bin into its spot. He wrapped my sandwich and shoved my chips in the bag like his life depended on forcefully  making my sandwich. He wouldn't look me in the eyes, and I'm glad he didn't, it was probably obvious that I was uncomfortable and utterly concerned with whoever is in charge of your hiring. Not to mention he had a downtrodden sloppy looking friend sitting in the corner with his failed attempt at a man bun just creeping the night away. I know people with down syndrome who could run a better subway. Get it together. And for the love of god, make sure that kid stays in school, he's got a lot of learning to do."}
{"text":"Vegas tends to be expensive to eat a meal, i get that.  If youre looking for a quick bite, i.e. $5 footlong, this is the perfect place.  Right on the Strip in O'Sheas.  Crowd tends to be on the younger side, college students, spring breakers, etc, so this is a great place to hang out if thats your crowd.

If not, dont mind the loud music and beer pong.  

They also offer $1 Beers... Who even does that anymore in Vegas?!?"}
{"text":"I just went there the 2 girls that are working there both speak Spanish I told them my order in Spanish , the one that was putting some crumbs on the bread answer me in English . Then she start making fun of what i was ordering. I asked what is the joke about my order? Because you are laughing. I will never go back there awful customer service."}
{"text":"I had to pick up a Sub from this location today and the lady working was one of the most delightful Sub way sandwich artist I have ever met ! She engaged me in conversation the whole time, asked me if there was enough or too much of anything she put on the sandwich and looked like she really put a lot of love into my friends sub. 

It was one of the best subway experiences I had ever had, and my friend said his sub was perfect. It isn't hard to screw this up , but usually the people working at subway don't provide much conversation and small talk. They are usually busy rushing everyone through the line. 

I would go back to this subway anytime ."}
{"text":"The service for this place stinks. I live close by and my car was in the shop so I walked to Subway to get some dinner.  The door facing Las Vegas blvd was locked so I walked along the side and the employee was hanging out with someone.  I knew they were supposed to be 24 hours but I ask anyway. Are you open? The response I got was \"no I'm on break\" not give me a minute or oh I'm sorry I'm on break can you come back in a couple minutes? He was very rude and then went back to his conversation and I walked home. I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Good subs, but the service is terrible! They usually only have one or two people (usually just one) working the line. Hire more people!!!"}
{"text":"The smell of fresh bread caused my mouth to start salivating when I entered the store.   Although they were out of cold cuts - this subway seemed to meet the usual corporate standard.

The sandwich artist was attentive and detailed, with good coverage and sauce application techniques."}
{"text":"Stopped into this subway in my hood this evening to feed the family, since my self cleaning oven took it's sweet time cleaning itself. No complaints of cleanliness and decor, even the sammiches were good, it was the service that sucked. Employees there did not greet nor smile, to make things worse, homegirl looked like captain cavemans sister. Pretty serious mug on her and her partner who was also inattentive needed a hair cut to boot. The thing that bummed me out was they had no fresh cookies on deck. What the eff."}
{"text":"Rude service. Horrible and stingy owner. U don't get much on the 'bun'.

DO NOT eat here!!!

I drive by this one to:
290 The West Mall , Unit 15-C"}
{"text":"Best Subway joint in the area. Great service, generous toppings, open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Quick, friendly,  and good.  This subway has always done a great job,  and the food taste as good as expected from subway."}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick sandwich. My son seems to enjoy the roast beef with all the fixings he likes. I however, just stick to the meatball sub. A lot still looks too much processed meat for my likening...roast beef not so much as the others. The bread is typically fresh but I guess you have to hit it at the right time. Sometimes it's dry and hard. The place is clean and the staff has always been friendly. I gave 3 stars cause my kid likes the food he eats, the place is clean and staff is friendly. I would take more stars away when it comes to the deli. I wish they would jump on board like all the other shops and slice your meat fresh in front of the customer. SO much better taste vs. tasting something that looks like it came out of a Lunch-Able."}
{"text":"The staff are completely clueless to what items are on the menu. I asked for the 6\" sub as a salad, and they had no idea what I was talking about, even though it was right behind the girls head. I did not want the chicken heated up and they asked \"who wants to eat cold chicken?\", obviously if I asked for it that way I want it cold and like it. They also were slow and unorganized. Not impressed with our experience at all."}
{"text":"this subway has the worst night shift in anthem. they are extremely rude and absolutely hate their jobs. i will be calling the mgr in the morning to verbally complain as well."}
{"text":"Subs are always good and fresh when we go here!  We eat here about once a month!  The workers are always pleasant and if you order from your phone it is always ready when you get there.   Occasionally the toppings are slightly wilted but that's the joys of living in Vegas lol"}
{"text":"Okay here is the thing.
They are racist. I got so embarrassed when I got there. No welcome with blunt face.
When I asked him to add an eggs in my sandwich, he told me \" what? What? Do you want eggs?\" He kept his fucking attitude again and again. He didn't smile at all when we're facing. He didn't wanna talk with me.
Just looking at vegetables on and on. Lol
I've been in many place in vegas and everybody is nice. 
It's horrible place I never been.
Fucking white guy ass hole. -_-
That's why it's really scary to talk with uneducated person."}
{"text":"Pretty fast service every time I've gone in and the food seems fresher than other locations I've been to."}
{"text":"Terrible service, they made the wrong sandwich but I took it anyways cause I didn't want to wait any longer the bread was old and hard, never going there again!!"}
{"text":"Go into this subway all the time and it's hit or miss with the customer service. Some workers appear to be new so I won't comment on them. Last time I went in one lady tried to argue that my coupon was for something else when it clearly stated buy one get one of equal or lesser value free. Rather rude telling us we didn't know what we were talking about when we were holding the coupon, and that was even after she took it to read it. Could have just been a bad day on her part. Sandwhiches are generally always good. Bread sometimes does not taste fresh. Will go back."}
{"text":"Terrible service, complete indifference by employees.  Asked for a 6 inch sub to be cut in half, employee cut the sub 80-20.  Loaded up my wife's sub with so much mustard it was inedible. These restaurants are supposed to provide a consistent experience, but the lazy staff at this location couldn't be bothered to deliver it.  No front shop presence, both employees were quick to abandon the messy dining room to go to the back and socialize. The worst fast food experience in Calgary I have had in a long time. My expectations are never high for this type of dining but they managed to under deliver.  AVOID."}
{"text":"Staffs are friendly, food looks fresh. The girl who made my sandwich was very patient and nice. Would recommend this place if you are in the mall and wants a casual meal."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this NO STARS!! The blonde girl at the register told me to leave she was so laZy and didn't want to work and obviously didn't want my money or business !"}
{"text":"Excellent service every time we come here.  Now they even let kids eat for free after 4pm and all day Sunday as long as the adult orders a meal.  Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Went here twice in two weeks and each time they didn't have chocolate chip cookies around dinner time. I know this is a sandwich place but why would they have it on their menu if they weren't going to have any."}
{"text":"Subway in sun prairie is under new management. The moment you walk in the door they greet every customer with a hello and welcome. When you leave after eating there, they ask you how everything was. Their customer service has definately improved. The small touches make a big difference. Amazing what new management & staff can do."}
{"text":"The staff working tonight was very friendly. The only thing missing is Cherry Coke."}
{"text":"This is The subway I go to every time for the people. The people there are great, so nice and fast every time to help me. The food is always made right and the people always put a smile on my face. Go here and always tip!"}
{"text":"I was troubled by how, for lack of a better word, stingy the workers were with the food, napkins, etc. Then, after sitting down, I realized that I was double charged. When I pointed it out they fixed it, but barely apologized. I decided to try their drive thru the next time. I thought: \"How cool! A drive thru at subway! Now I don't have to get out of the van with the kids!\" After ordering and driving to the pick up window the woman asked that we never use the drive thru again. She said we ordered too much food. ??? 
5 sandwiches and a mini cheese pizza. No drinks. No chips. Nothing else. If you are going to have a drive thru and it is intended for people only ordering one sandwich please have a sign indicating as much. Honestly that is the only reason we went today so they would have lost that service.
Won't be returning. There is another subway a mile down the road."}
{"text":"I like eating Subway. However, this place has the rudest Subway employee I have ever seen. As soon as I began my order, one of their employees, Tom, talked to me as if I was stupid. I ask for flatbread, and as soon as I say that, he rolls his eyes at me in a rude fashion. He'll talk down to and patronize customers. I hate coming into here when he's working, because of how he talks to the customers. I went in with my friends, an he was unfriendly and rude to all 6 of us."}
{"text":"WOW -- What a clean subway and a very friendly staff.  Oh, the veggie sandwich was great."}
{"text":"This may not be the best subway I've ever been to but being one of the closest options I would gladly come here versus the other closer location I've had so many bad experiences they are the ones at this location have apologized sincerely to me for another stores mistakes which is not their job but I appreciate how friendly they are never had a mistake on my sandwiches everything is done right one of my favorite servers being the female employee Ashley she always pays attention and make sure its done correctly along with from my experience 90% of the other employees I've never had an issue with and I recommend this subway versus the other closer location"}
{"text":"Normally I would give it a five but went in there couple of days ago and requested the Ruben .  The manager said sorry were out of thousand island dressing! Do what?? Are you kidding? He also said don't know when he would get some do to very busy! Are you kidding? I got the spicy Italian switch is always good,"}
{"text":"This is the worst subway outlet I ever visited.... I have been waiting in queue for around 30 mins at 12.30 am...the guy working here is unprofessional ...just not because he is serving only one customer so long ... he keeps on playing with them and made others to wait outside in cold weather..."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they started having a breakfast sandwich, I had the Egg and Cheese on the flatbread, It's very good, The Girl that waited on me was very nice, She helped me to decide what cheese and continents to put on another sandwich that I had never had before, it's close to my home and I will continue to visit this establishment anytime I'm close by."}
{"text":"I always experience good service here.  I usually stop in around 4:00 on a weekday.  The female behind the counter in the afternoon during the week  is great, always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"garbage every single time! who seriously squishes their sandwich before eating it? this fast food chain employs too many people who don't care. Don't call yourself a sandwich artist if your going to make me a sandwich and not care. make it like its YOUR sandwich you are about to eat!"}
{"text":"Worst Subway ever.I know what you are thinking, \"I just want something quick and cheap.oh look, Subway!\"
Stop right there.Quick, yes.Cheap, yes, but not in the way you think.Cheap quality food and service.5 dollar footlong doesn't exist here, it's more like 9 bucks.I had to remind the sandwich \"artist\" to put gloves on, the bread tasted like it had been made weeks ago.Save your money and go for the 2 dollar footlong hotdogs next door."}
{"text":"I love subway. I used to be a manager at another location and I have to say this store employes by far the RUDIEST employee I've ever seen. She's a heavier set white woman and every time I go in this store she's impatient and just plain rude not only to me but my co workers notice it as well. she defiantly gives this store a bad look & if she worked at my store I would have already fired her! I will always go to subway just NEVER this location. Upper management should defiantly check into this."}
{"text":"Hate this Subway!! Pam has got to be the dumbest manager since she just does not know how to run a restaurant. The employees always overcharge, have to be corrected and some of them are as dumb as the manager about the regular pricing and the deals going on! Not the new deals that subway comes up with mind you, but the basic meal-time deals, etc. UGHHH!!! Did I mention that I hate and boycott this particular Subway?"}
{"text":"Ne parlent pas français. N'ouvrent pas à l'heure prévue (7h du matin, je suis repassé à 8:15, toujours fermés). Les sandwichs sont maigrement garnis et les prix ont récemment augmentés. J'espère que cette succursale choisira de corriger cela tout de suite ou de fermer."}
{"text":"4 stars because the staff is friendly and fast.  The restaurant is small but clean.  Strong, free wifi.

Biggest downside is that the location occasionally draws some unpleasant crowds.  About a 25% chance there will a crazy person, a panhandler, or some other obnoxious type there."}
{"text":"This place has finally gotten itself together.  New management came in about 8 months ago, staff stabilized, and now I would say that it is on par or better than your average Subway."}
{"text":"Subway was offering buy a sub get a sub free they were giving you that deal the thing they were not telling you is you have to buy a soda but they were not telling you that or even giving you the cups for the soda. The manager Heather was very rude when i inquired about what I found on the receipt. 
Oh yeah and be cautious about eating their cookies found mold on the bottom of this one."}
{"text":"I have frequented this store for years now. It has remained clean, staffed well even during busy times the line moves fast. I appreciate their service and have ever had a bad experience in five years. Regarding previous negative reviews I would remind consumers that anyone can have a bad day. Young people often staff service jobs and are learning their way through as they start out in life. It never feels good to have a negative experience. People are out of control at times these days. But management Is usually responsive and wanting to make it right if you treat them respectfully. I have not had an experience requiring that level of complaint at this store so I can't speak to that here. Surprise locations I have found to be very nice in general."}
{"text":"The worst subway I have ever been to, and that's saying a lot. Simple tuna on wheat. They put hardly any tuna on it and then smear it so thin it's basically the bread again, I thought they had forgotten it by the time I got to the veggies. Two different people had handled my sandwich already I wasn't sure about asking for more. Then 10 pieces of lettuce, I seriously had to ask for more lettuce. Lettuce. Such a disappointment for a basic sandwich , I'll spend the extra $ and go to jersey mikes down the street."}
{"text":"Was a huge fan of subway but they got rid of my favorite sandwitch chicken pizziola. I was able to still get it but they said that they couldnt anymore. I had to find a new fav but would like it more if they would bring it back. Most the subways in las vegas favor their own people or if you speak the language. Other than that could be better."}
{"text":"Very understaffed! The guy working was very rude because he was the only one on the line, made my sandwich in a rush, wasn't very good. SAD!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 12\" tuna sub.  The sandwich maker went out of her way to make sure that I didn't get any extra tuna, going so far as to scrape any tuna clinging on the outside of the scoop onto the storage bin side. 12\" tuna sub with meal deal= $13.00.  Most expensive I have ever bought.  Never again at this location."}
{"text":"Good place for quick food been there when I was hungry they made nice club sandwich,, that's made me a regular customer for here,, thanks for good service"}
{"text":"Beware! Beware! This Subway gave me my first case of food poisoning!!!! Not fun! I would really appreciate it if employees cared about the people that they are serving. Gross! Needless, to say I WILL not be returning! Nope!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst subway restaurants I have ever been too.   I say this as the result of multiple disappointing visits.   First off they don't participate in any of the national subway promotions and offer no deals.   This is the first one outside of an airport, rest stop, etc that I have ever seen do that.   Second off they are stingy as heck.   They have twice told me no when I asked for more of a certain vegetable.  Also the people are not very friendly.   Avoid this subway at all costs!"}
{"text":"Usually I don't review chain restaurants on yelp. Frankly, there's no reason to; their strict adherence to their protocols leaves very little room for actually impressing people or doing anything different. 

Is this place different?  Not in the sense that  it does things that are not allowed - a \"rogue\" subway. 

Simply speaking, it's the best quality Subway I've been to; their staff is friendly, their store is clean, and their bread...let me tell about their bread. I'm not sure what they do to their bread, but it's consistently fresher and tastier than any other subway. I can actually get a regular bread (not toasted)

How do I know? Try the one on Bloor & Spadina and then compare the bread. No competition."}
{"text":"Ordered 6\" steak and cheese and a side chopped salad.  Got home, opened the sandwich and was appalled at what Subway considers a sandwich.  Meat was paltry, cheese practically non-existent, and roll not toasted (which I had asked for).  Was so angry, I went back to ask if this sandwich was in fact complete.  Staffer said yes, and everyone gets the same amount and there was nothing he could do.  I left, with the sub, which I ate because I was STARVING!  This isn't my first rodeo with a Subway, so I never expected a gourmet sandwich, but this was just downright ridiculous!  Tired of being taken advantage of as a consumer!  Five bucks is five bucks, right?!?!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, we walked in. Saw the employee touching everything with her gloves and my fiancé politely asked her to please change her gloves and she gave a snotty childish attitude the whole time and didn't wash her hands after she changed gloves and she touches bread with her bare hands. Janell was her name and she tried giving my fiancé false names. Nothing was done management wise. Disgusting place."}
{"text":"Staff works remarkably well as a team during the lunch rush. Food met or exceeded our expectations. Restaurant is clean but can be a bit noisy when busy. Steady stream of seemingly happy customers during our visit. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place! Very friendly staff. And they make the subs look like what you see on tv, not all thrown together. Very clean establishment also."}
{"text":"Location is very convenient. It seemed like any other subway. It smelt good and tasted good, but shortly after eating it, I was sick and had stomach pain. While I'm not completely sure if it caused it, I don't think I ate anything for 5 hours before that meal so it seems very probable. I don't think I'll be going back just in case."}
{"text":"Brian made my sandwich fast and clean , while chatting back and forth , great worker . Stays busy , cleaning and stocking up for the grave yard person ."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick breakfast sandwich this morning. Worst subway ever! No flatbread in stock and no avocados! These are all items that are on the everyday menu! The store manager needs to get it together!"}
{"text":"Subway sandwitches is like my family."}
{"text":"Still has five dollar subs.   Clean.  Timely. Our sandwich artist made the sandwich neatly.  All I expect from a subway"}
{"text":"Me and wife bought two foot long steak sandwiches. We been sick all next day! Not Coming back here!"}
{"text":"Good luck being a regular at this place. I only come here because it's more convenient to drive here than the Avondale-Buckeye location. This one they always try guessing my sub, cracking weird jokes, takes forever to get through the line because one in particular always stops to make stupid jokes about things like you not getting sauce. Just leave me alone and let me order what i want and leave!! Instead since they know I dont like it, it's become a running joke for them to be as obnoxious as possible intentionally. I just want subway, that's all! I swear, because regulars are punished with this awful treatment i have to now go to the further one where they at least have respect for their customer base."}
{"text":"The girls that work in this subway have the absolute worst attitudes ive ever ran into in my entire life. There are like 5 other subways in medina and I would steer clear of this one unless you want to be talked down to. Apparently being a sandwich artist is a pretty stressful job. If I could id rate them less than one star"}
{"text":"I just called to ask a simple question and the manager there shut the barn door. What's up with that."}
{"text":"Had my 6 year old nephew with me who is the worlds pickiest eater. He had subway pizza one time and ate it. After we tried the pizza hut, who were out of cheese for their pizza, we went here. They no longer offer pizza but Matt and Randy were were helpful, friendly, and patient.  We figured out we could just do open face cheese and flat bread. Saved me an hour of pain and drivinv searching for food! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I just saw the only other review that this location has... and I am in 100% agreement.  
I go into this location often as it is located in my building and very convenient.  However today will be my last visit there.   One of the employees has been rude to me every single time she has had to serve me.  When I come in and approach the counter she just looks at me, I usually proceed to make an order after she stares at me for a few seconds without saying \" hello\" or \"can I take your order\".  This morning she looks at me and says, \"YES\"?   I ask for an egg white flat bread and before I could finish she had turned around to grab the bread.  Then because she couldn't hear me finish my order she turned back around and gave me this pissed off look with a face and said \"WHAT\"?  I looked at her like WTH is your problem and why are you looking at me like I just offended you?   I told her nevermind, I was sorry I had bothered her and left the store.  This was the last straw.  Yes, the 20th time you were rude to me was one too many!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I got Subway but I was getting gas at Love's so I figured it's right inside the building. This location is horrible. The girl making my sandwich was rude and unprofessional . There was a new kid training and she kept yelling at him in front of everyone. The mistakes he was making were very minor. I asked for black olives and she literally gave me two. I asked again, very politely for a little more and she rolled her eyes at me. Everyone in line looked uncomfortable . The cashier did apologize for her rolling my sandwich towards me but wouldn't bag it. Tuna melt in the hood."}
{"text":"Subs are consistent here. Friendly staff, soft bread, and fresh cookies!!"}
{"text":"I feel bad for the employees here, they were insanely understaffed and rushing around trying to make sandwiches and also run the cash register. They were very friendly and attentive but extremely stressed.

Unfortunately, when I ate my sandwich it was horrible! I think it was the bread that was the main problem, it just kinda fell apart and was super crumbly."}
{"text":"Drive the extra minute to the Subway next door.  The guy who made my sandwich came straight from outside and immediately put gloves on without washing his hands.  The register guy tried to ring me up for the most expensive combo they had. A homeless man was moving from table to table."}
{"text":"I work close in between this Subway and another one, but I prefer to go to the one on West 117th and Madison. They don't have enough people working here and if there is a long line, they don't care. They work like snails and dont put enough veggies, even when you keep asking. The one on W.117 and Madison puts on as much veggies as you want!"}
{"text":"I gave them 2 stars after trying several times to get extra veggies on my sub. Subway used to advertise \"free fixins\". Does anyone remember that? I have been eating Subway for years, so I do. This place wanted to charge me for extra veggies. The employees are nice, but they have to follow rhe rules. They only alowed to put so much on the sub.

I will stick to my usual location on W.117 and Madison. They always put as much as I want. This Subway and the Detroit Subway are close to my work, but they are both cheap!.you'd think they would want to keep their customers. They don't care. It's never busy here, and I can see why."}
{"text":"So, I gave this place 5 stars. Mostly I like to review a place if its really good or there is anything different about it compared to other businesses of the same type. My first review was not recommended. I don't know why. I work at the other end of Lakewood where there is another Subway. I prefer to drive to this one because it is cleaner and the girls that work there are quick and friendly. They pretty much know what I want when they see me. It is take out only and its kinda small. I've been coming here for years."}
{"text":"This is a tiny store. Wldnt expect much. The people were manageable. The stairs up front are kinda high. The entire spree fits abt 15 people. Food was still well prepared thou"}
{"text":"This is the worst sub shop in the entire Valley of the Sun. 

Let me list the problems:
1. The sandwich \"artists\" don't know how to make the sandwich.
- Listen, I get it, its a minimum wage, dealing with the ass-hat public, maybe I should go to Phoenix College and get a degree in Nursing so I don't have to work here sort of gig. 
- But c'mon, when you're putting on 1/2 of what the customer pays for, then give them a shitty look because they want you to do your job right. 
- Take a shower once in a blue moon. When you walk by me, and my nose hairs are running for cover, you shouldn't be handling food.

2. Parking sucks
- There are 3 eateries and a Verizon here. With that, if you can find a place to park, you might want to buy some lotto tickets and consider running for Pope that same day.

I'm over this place. I am really glad I am moving away so this place isn't my main choice for cheaply, slopply made food.

Long story short; don't eat here. Hopefully if the bottom line falls far enough the owner gets the message and finds some people who give half a shit about their jobs."}
{"text":"This is the WORST SUBWAY RESTAURANT EVER!!! and I've been to MANY subways in my time. 

Initially, we were served with a younger man who told us that the bread we wanted was unavailable, that's fine. We went for our usual bread - Italian herb and cheese :) 

We went on a Monday and got the steak and cheese sub. The first lad put t he THINNEST layer of meat my friend and I have ever had. Next thing you know, a couple of older 'Persian' (?)' men were behind the counter assisting us. That's fine, too. What's NOT fine was them speaking their own language and eyeing my friend down like a bag of meat. Their intentions became VERY clear when they spoke to her in english. It was DISGUSTING!!! Not to mention the older man putting the veggies on the sub was EXTREMELY STINGY. 4 spaced cucumbers for a footlong? Oh, really? 
3 spaced slices of tomatoes?! wow. 

Even though I was ordering they BOTH kept staring at my friend like I wasn't even there. It was despicable, disgusting, and utterly shameful. These men need to learn how to deal with customers, how to make a sub, and how to keep their zippers up. Not to mention my friend is clearly a MINOR. 

This establishment is a disgrace to the Subway franchise and should not be operating in the current state."}
{"text":"Way to often running out of bread. Your a sandwich shop seriously how much can it cost you you bake your own bread for cents for footlong. I suspect this low traffic subway is cost cutting, I would goto a busier area one from now on"}
{"text":"Food tasted fine.. Employees were rude though.. Didn't greet us when we walked in the door and when I got up to the counter she stares at me with a straight face and asks what I want. I like to be greeted when I go to places and feel welcome definitely felt the opposite going here."}
{"text":"This subway has moldie food the service sucks it takes about 2 hours just to get a sandwich and they bugs all over the place I WOULD NOT COME BACK TO THIS SUBWAY"}
{"text":"Today I had very little time for a lunch so I ordered a sub online at my nearby Subway. When I walked in to pick up the sandwich the lady at the counter said she never got my order. I tried to show her my order confirmation I had on my phone but she immediately called her superior while ignoring me.  I asked if I could have the sandwich i ordered but she kept saying she never got the order. I had receipt of payment and a confirmation number she refused to look at. Since I was in a hurry, hence why I ordered online, I had to go! So I left five dollars poorer and no sandwich. Sadly I don't think I'll be going back to this location which is a shame since it was two minutes walking distance from my work. Still waiting for refund. I complained through the app. I'm still very hungry and have a few hours of my shift left before I'll have time to get food. :("}
{"text":"I go here 3 times a week, yes I'm addicted. The employees learn your favorite sandwich over time and even your name! I come back treated like royalty and I really live them for that. The food is REALLY good though! They make it exactly how you like it no questions asked. The  manager has years of expirence and nails it every time. 

I only had a couple poor expirences but that was with the same employee going SUPER slow and even double toasting my (cold) sandwich? The rest are amazing though. 

I love this location. They actually care unlike most locations and that's why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in at subway for a cheap bite not expecting much... But this location was clean the food was fresh and staff was friendly!!"}
{"text":"Biggest influence for the 1 star, the girl with acne and white strands of hair not washing her hands after scratching and picking at her face while waiting on customers! I noticed this right away and then saw her put gloves on to add veggies to my sandwich.  
When I get home I see a white strand of long hair right between my sub after I unwrap. Threw the whole sandwich away...yuck"}
{"text":"The place was clean and the server was nice, however he gave me a footlong when I asked for half and I didn't notice until I was paying and it was so expensive. He also didn't warn me that avocado incurred extra charges. You never know when a patron is foreign so these things are good to warn them of..."}
{"text":"We were in the midst of helping our mother in law move and decided to run get some sandwiches. After paying $28 for 3 foot longs, I asked if I could have some paper plates and napkins. I was told they don't have paper plates and questioned  \"didn't I already give you napkins?\" I said it didn't look like there were any and was given 5 napkins. I then asked for a few more as we were \"messy\".  He then pointed to Walmart and said I could go buy some in the store! To which I replied, \"I think I already spent enough money with you!\"  

This Subway will never get my business again."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying: I get it. It's a Subway; I didn't go in expecting a 5-star meal. I went in expecting a mediocre sandwich. But seriously, when you can't even match those standards, there's an issue. 

The staff here is absolutely terrible. I've unfortunately been in twice (it's close to my house, so it's a quick stop), and both times the staff treated me like I was putting them out by making them do their job. The girl who finally took my order couldn't bother to toast my sandwich all the way, despite the fact that I was one of a whopping two costumers in line. After half-toasting it, she slammed it down on the table and flopped the piece of unmelted cheese over so it was half on the bread, half off. Their vegetables were old-- like, older than most Subway vegetables (a feat of accomplishment, if you really think about it). The kid at the register rung me up without asking if I'd like anything else. Honestly, this place needs NEW staff, as I'm not sure these individuals could possibly be taught costumer service. 

The restaurant itself isn't dirty, but it's clear it's not kept up well. The soda machine was out of pretty much all syrups, and there were no lids to be found. Seriously, if you have that bad a hankering for a fast food sandwich, hit the Subway 2 miles down the road. You'll be glad you didn't come to this one."}
{"text":"Subway is great!....  just NOT THIS LOCATIION !!
I have no idea why or how it came to be. - but everyone - from the manager on down is just, just ...  [searching through my thesaurus for the right word .. hmm .. hmm ] .. ah LAME.

here it is ...
I order using the online system ALL the time - an average of 5-7 times per week at different subways all over the country (mostly in my area of Phoenix).  Everywhere else, no matter how busy - within 15-20 mins, I can pick up my order.  The employees know how to manage the incoming online order vs the walk-ins.

This store .. it is so bad it is comical.  Here is one example of the 4-5 times I tried with them:
There is a Starbucks next door, so I was sitting there and decided to pace an order ... and I watched.  There was 1 customer in the store, maybe 2 ...  I waited 15-20 mins and came in to pick up my order.  He hadn't even started it!   And his excuse - \"sorry there were customers in line\".  (umm ... online orders don't state on the ticket \"please make this sandwhich whenever the store is empty\").  I had to wait 3-4 times longer for my order, thann if I stranded in line.  Other times the order was plain wrong (youusually don't find out until you are far away...)

I'd write more about how poor the management and service is, in this one store (all the rest are great!) .. I just don't want to waste more time on them ... but be warned."}
{"text":"I walked in, girl gave me the stink eye, i said hey really politely, she gave me attitude shoulder shrug with a blank stare (as she scratched inside of her nostril!) I left immediately. Was looking for ashton to come around the corner and say, \"you been punked\""}
{"text":"Always fresh and easy. Going to try eating subway for a whole month hopefully I can lose some weight. I love the turkey sandwich here."}
{"text":"Usually I am a huge fan of Subway restaurants. Aside from the fact that they are high in sodium, they appear to be the healthiest fast food choice and I do eat Subway sandwiches often, about 3 times a week. 
However, this Subway restaurant is the stingiest and the cheapest that I have ever been to. The owner is there monitoring everything and is EXTREMELY cheap about giving vegetables, meats and condiments. He is particularly cheap about giving vegetables when ordering the sandwich deals... Aside from being cheap, he is not shy about giving his opinion on what should and should not be had with the sandwich choice. Not what goes well with the sandwich, but what should not be had because of the price of the sandwich! As a customer, I was very disappointed with this restaurant and the service each time I go and try to avoid this restaurant as much as possible!"}
{"text":"Good service, friendly and quick.  Sandwiches are good........just wish they would have a larger selection of breads.  Otherwise very good all around."}
{"text":"walked in to a line of 4 people... after waiting 10 minutes just to order my sub because the cashier has no backbone and let some Mexican lady talk on her phone for 3 minutes before paying... ANYWAYS back to this AMAZING PLACE where my toasted meatball sub has been waiting 5 minutes now. I can see the cheese turning into rubber in front of my eyes... than a HUGH FLY lands on my GF's sub and is on it for over 30 seconds... 3 workers back there not 1 see's this fly?? the guy walks up looks at her sub the fly than gets off and he still does not see this?!?!?! I WANTED TO THROW UP!!.. I than after waiting 20 minutes for a SUB!!!! walked out! guess what subway ill never be walking in again!"}
{"text":"Nice hidden Subway, great service, quality food, although gas station is quite dirty. I enjoy coming here for a snack after a long day"}
{"text":"It's subway. There isn't much else to say. The employees always look dead inside. It has that fake fresh bread smell just like all the subway locations. I usually end up going here when I go to blockbuster and smell that sickly addicting smell for 10 minutes while browsing for a movie. I'm almost always disappointed, but overall you can do worse in the fast food realm."}

{"text":"I'm giving three stars because the food was good and the employees were very nice. HOWEVER, there was no tea available and three of the eight fountain drinks were labeled \"Out of Order.\"  That's almost half!  In fact, if I add in unsweetened tea not being available as well, that makes five of their ten usually available drinks gone. That's HALF!  Did someone not order enough soda syrup?  We all have a preferred drink, and it really stinks when that drink is not there. Also, one employee had a friend visiting and while I was dining I heard them cutting up and I heard a few S words and F words as part of their conversation. Now, I can handle cussing, but I don't want to hear it while in a restaurant, especially coming from employees. To top it all off, on the wall, a little baby cockroach came walking by. It was cute, so, amused and disgusted, my daughter and I just watched it head on its way."}
{"text":"I went there at 10 pm and it was a bad experience because it was only 1 employee doing everything and the line was so long that I had to leave, I really thing they need more personnel helping otherwise this place will be a mess"}
{"text":"Service is really slow.  One person working is not enough.  I walked out 2 weeks ago for the same reason.  There are better choices in this area.  Do not come here."}
{"text":"Every time I've gone into this location, let alone any Subway I've experienced terrible service. But without a doubt this one has the worst workers. HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES. Maybe ones that smile sometimes?"}
{"text":"I love this subway! It's clean, fast, and I always leave happy. Krystal, who is also the manager, is always sooo friendly! Ex: I told her I was dieting and she gave me all kinds of tips! She removed some of my bread , loaded up on  my fav veggies, no cheese and also gave me light mayo packets so I could measure exact calories. I always appreciate great customer service, I am loyal to this particular subway just because of that!"}
{"text":"I go to this subway many times a week because the staff is great and the food is also delicious. Unlike other subways I've visited the staff here is very kind and even takes an interest in their customer by making great conversation making it even better."}
{"text":"When I go to Subway I really don't expect much.  I understand that the meat I'm eating is full of giblets and highly processed.  I get that the veggies will be limp from sitting out all day.  I know that the employees will be about as friendly as zombies having had to work a soul sucking job all day.  

What i don't expect, understand, get or know is coming....a crampy food poisoned stomach from the moldy tomatoes you put on my sandwich (and much to my chagrin I discovered halfway into eating the darn thing.)  This is a subway to beat them all."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the negative reviews. This Subway is my go-to for a quick sandwich fix. Sandwiches are always made the way I like them and they even remind me of certain promotions so that I'm not paying more than I have to! The service here is always great. Quick tip if you want nice service - if you treat the employees like humans then they treat you like one."}
{"text":"Slowest drive through in town and then still got the order wrong, causing me to have to go in to correct it. Avoid this subway."}

{"text":"I was so hungry this morning at 8am. For some reason I was craving subway but from the lunch menu. I called and the woman was super nice over the phone and said Rey had both breakfast and lunch. When I came in she was super friendly and totally made me an awesome sub and saved my craving. Just wantto let management know she (morning person) is a great part of your staff. Thanks."}
{"text":"I've come here late nights a few times and think I'm about done with this particular location. It's always been the same woman who's helped me and each time I feel like I'm creating a huge bother for her by just being a customer. Meh, I'll pass on the sandwiches made with disdain."}
{"text":"It's subway, food is...subway...if you can't get to a local mom and pop spot, thyey'll do."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here just about every week. It's somewhat healthy if you pile on the veggies. We usually get a few subs and split them up. The staff at this Subway knows us which is helpful because they're used to our odd requests. It's kind of an odd thing to be a regular somewhere. You can't beat the price on the sub of the month at $5.00! We usually get our food to go, so I can't really comment on the cleanliness of the establishment. When we are there we usually see an employee cleaning something."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. However their flat bread breakfast sandwich is a disaster. What a contrast to their amazing toasted sandwiches!
I will never make the mistake of having their breakfast sandwich ever again. I took one look at their cold mini pre prepared omelette. ...and lost visual appetite.  Totally lost my appetite after taking a bite."}
{"text":"Hey.  Don't mean to bash on Subway and not the one on Carefree.  It's Phoenix but cave creek zip.  I adopted/ mentored a poor little black kid with a wonderful single mom with not much money.  He struggled in school. One time he did well  on a difficult exam.  I told him today when we go to lunch, you pick.  He said \"Taco Bell. \". I said no honey we can.go anywhere, I'm really proud of you.   Nope Taco Bell.  So he gets his dozen choices.  Kid could put the food down.   This was was when they introduced the Chalupa and had the signs up. So he is eating his food and he says  \"dad, you know what I realize? No son, what.  Why is the Chalupa in the pictures always prettier than the chalupa you get?   I said buddy that is how life works.  I just got some subway for a co worker and I the other day.  His choice.  The sandwiches we got didn't look like the.subway commercials.  But they tasted good.  But that's my lesson my yelpers.  Fast food is about getting you fed, not to take the wife for her birthday.  Enjoy and stay safe.  And  he gobbled that chalupa by the way.  Like my buddy crushed his turkey subway.   And I have to say the employees at subway are always very polite.   So they got that going for them, which is nice"}
{"text":"I was getting ready to leave for Spokane, and just kind of hanging around.   It was a couple of hours until I had to leave for the airport, and I was hungry. I thought I would stop by one of the sandwich shops near my place, get a sandwich to go, and relax by the pool with a beer and sandwich.

I headed to 90th and Via Linda and headed for the Lunch Box.  Damn, it was not even 4 PM, and they were closed.  Well, no problem - the Vermont Sandwich Company was right across the street, I would go there.  What the hell, they were closed too, even though their sign said they were open until 4:00.  I just wanted a \"fu***** sandwich to wash down with my beer and I couldn't even get one.

I noticed a Subway across the intersection, so I thought, why not?  Went in and the server making the sandwiches was great.  What a personality!!   And the sandwich was good too - one of the best I have ever had at a Subway.  Of course, I got one of those low calorie ones, so I headed home to supplement it with beer. 

For a Subway, I have to give it three stars - at least they were open!!"}
{"text":"Subway's sandwiches are about the same at all locations, so this review is based strictly on service.  This place rocks!  It is run by three women that do an outstanding job at serving customers.  They are cheerful, friendly, and pleasant.  They serve you blindingly fast and they assemble your sandwich exactly as you specified.  I have eaten at several Subways and this is by far the best run one.  I have become a regular."}
{"text":"I use to come to this subway all the time since it was so close to my house but after my last experience I will never return. It was painful ordering my sandwich. I asked them for a 6inch chicken guacamole sandwich that they where advertising all over the store. First he brings out a foot long so I had to repeat that I only wanted a 6inch. He was too busy joking around with his buddy working with him to concentrate. Then he starts asking me what I wanted on the sandwich and I tell him I want exactly what is listed on the menu. He could not figure it out! He even asked me which one of the cheeses was cheddar .... I wanted to just leave but I didn't want to rude. I almost went back today but I saw that it was him working and didn't even get out of my car. I would rather drive to another subway."}
{"text":"This Subway always looks so clean and I have never had an issue with my food or order. However 90% of the time they don't open on time. They have posted that they open at 7am, however they are always at least 10 mins or more behind!  Which when your heading to work is an inconvenience. Again, it happens the majority of the time. If you can't be prepared to open at your posted time, change your operation hours. Even now, as I'm writing this I'm sitting outside the store watching the workers and they still have yet to open at 7:07. And they never apologize for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!!!  Be warned that they will screw you over royally!!!!  I had a coupon for buy one get one free and they refused to honor it!!!  They wait until you have had your sandwiches made and are paying for them and then they tell you they will not accept the coupon!!!!   It is not posted anywhere in the store when you come in or on the door.  I showed them my coupon when I was standing in line too which makes me even more ticked off.  If you refuse to pay for it they will call the police.  I will NEVER EVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!!  Be forewarned they are scammers!!!!  I don't even wanna give them a star but to post this I am required to.  I would leave negative stars if I could!!!"}
{"text":"How does Subway get away with displaying menu boards that show good portions of meat or tuna when in reality, if you didn't get a ton of veggies you would have a sandwich with paper thin meat or tuna in it.  I asked the girl if she was spreading butter on my roll when she put the tuna in it.  Isn't that false advertising?  People are posting was a good deal their $5 subs are.  Really?  They have like $.20 of meat in them and one piece of cheese that has been cut in fours.  For $4.99 at Jack-In-The-Box I can get a big, fat burger, french fries and a soda.  Seriously people.  Dont let Subway rip you off."}
{"text":"Not a 5 star restaurant, but definitly a 5 star subway. It's amazing how efficient they operate during lunch rush (which is 12-15 people deep) consistently. If you're in the back of the line, you'll be out the door in 7 min. The food has always been fresh, and they ensure you get exactly what and how much you want. They even allow people to turn a foot long into 2 separate sandwiches (same base with different toppings) so cheap asses can save $1.50! You can text in orders which makes it more convenient to pick up mutiple sandwiches. Great job every time! If youre in a rush and want to get your subway on, go there!"}
{"text":"Have all the sandwiches you expect from a Subway. Friendly staff and good location       Spacious inside with the more modern Subway look."}
{"text":"I just wanted to put this comment out there.  I went to this location for the first time today.  The customer service was excellent.  The best I've ever had.  My food was delicious, once I was done one of the co-workers offered to throw it away for me and told me to drive safely when I was leaving.  Never experienced any of that before.  Definitely recommend this one"}

{"text":"To much bread! Ladies are rude and drive through is slow!  It would be nice to taste the inside of your sandwich"}
{"text":"every single time I came to this subway, rude employees. Been here a few times, live near by here won't come again. They rushed me and when I asked a question the male employee snapped."}
{"text":"Everybody is always giving their best effort here. If you come during peak hours expect to wait in line for a few minutes. I like to add bacon to my sandwich, but not toast my sandwich - and they understand how to heat the bacon separately and not look at me like I'm stupid for not wanting my entire sandwich hot. I love coming here because when I ask them politely to murder my sandwich with mayonnaise - they follow through."}
{"text":"This place was a joke there tea was gross and my sandwich was soooo bad and did not look right . There vegetables was not green and when I question it they looked at me like I was crazy . F that place ."}
{"text":"One of the cleanest Subways I have ever been in well stocked friendly employees  definitely going back"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give no stars. I visit this subway several times because I stay close by. Sandwiches are very poorly made and the product is not so fresh. I just decided that I would not be a customer any more after an Indian man told me I could not get my bread toasted more... It should always be about the customer! This was not my only problem that day I had a coupon for a free sandwich equal or less value and I had purchased a foot long. He did not want to give me a free foot long like my coupon says. He said I could only have two 6in sandwiches. And I already had the 2 sandwiches from my foot long he was just going to cut it in half. I was so upset I didn't want the deal anymore. He opened my sandwich after he wrapped it and tried to take the other half of the sandwich. It was not cut all the way threw so he took the knife and recut it and took the other half of the sandwich. All without putting on gloves. He was kind of angry too because I wanted him to understand the coupon. I told him never mind and had to settle for something else that night."}
{"text":"6 inch sub was actually 4 inch, less meat, less vegetables, cost the same, unfriendly service, no greeting or communications, just hand you receipt even without looking at you, not to mention any greetings."}

{"text":"Good is great here. But one member of staff constantly screws up my order. Every time i go in Pedro either screws up my sandwich or doesnt ring up an item and then tries to over charge me for it. Take for instance today. I got my usual bmt. With chips and drink and i added a soup. So after the transaction is rang up he starts yelling at me for making a drink. And i had said yes and made eye contact while i said yes.  So he tries to charge me over 2$ extra for my drink so i demanded that he rings up the whole order again because i am not being ripped off by this man again. I will not return to this subway again if Pedro is still working here. He obviously has some kind of language barrier or blatantly does not listen to people."}
{"text":"This is Store # 11045 at Pecos and Tropicana right on the corner where the Sunflower Market Mall is.     702-451-0125

This particular Shop is in the top 5% of the nation as far as we are concerned The meats are high quality, well kept and well sliced.  Veggies are definitely fresh, crisp, well cleaned and displayed. The folks who make the Subway Sandwiches are very pleasant and work very fast to give you what you want and how you want it. The shop is always clean and fresh. It makes you confident, happy and proud to be a customer. The Subway Sub Makers actually know my Wife by name and what she is going to order. This is one of the very best in the chain."}
{"text":"Nice space for a Subway.  However, a previous reviewer mentioned the exposed brick and I was shocked to notice that most or all of the brick is actually a huge laminate sticker!  Or brick pattern printed wallpaper.  I couldn't tell exactly as it is higher up on the wall, above those old nyc subway maps.  I was disappointed and would far prefer to look at real brick as I eat my sammich.  I'm not going to take a star off, but I hope management reads this I hope they consider real brick.  Also, that commercial about guacamole is very annoying.  \"Guac-a-mole-AY\"... When she says that I want to smash my TV.   All that aside, great service, clean restaurant, good sub!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches made here. My usual stomping ground when it comes to a meatball hero. Have not tried the other sandwiches. The peppers are fresh and peanut butter cookies are yummy too.

Staff is friendly and welcoming. I try to stop by at least once a month. 

Usually get a bag of chip and a water on the go as well.

Interesting spot for a sandwich shop. Good thing I use my navigation device to find this place. It's kind of hidden away. Not like a stand out eatery like the Jack in the Box or Burger King at the corner. The subway is nestled near other establishments."}
{"text":"This is more for grab and go. Its the smallest subway I've ever been to and I've been to many. There's 1 tiny table and just enough space for The line. Huge line at 12 everyday for lunch but any other time is good. The quality of the sandwich is a tad bit less than any other subway and the price is a little higher.  Not a fan but good for quick food"}
{"text":"The staff is not friendly at all. When u ask them to toast the sub or to add toppings, u can see from there faces that they are burdened. I understand that I go early when they open, but that doesn't give them the right to act like the way they do. The don't really say hi at all, instead I end up saying how Ur doing. If I had a choice to not to go to this branch, I would totally avoide this one."}
{"text":"Last three visits were totally unsatisfactory. I will not be back. Wrong sandwich took two additional visits to get a decent sandwich. That means customer before me got wrong sandwich too! No communication at all! Next time, there weren't enough ingredients on my footlong to even make a decent half sandwich. No communication. Last visit same with ingredients, Ordered a Club. Girl had no idea what I was talking about. Took two other girls to finally figure out what I wanted. It's plainly listed on the menu! After saying \"Club\" 5 times, I kept getting a blank stare. Tried to describe it and was met with another blank stare. Tried to point it out on the menu, another blank stare. She finally asked another girl and was told what I wanted.  Again, short on ingredients. No communication. Train your employees about your products and how to assemble them to maintain consistency. Put somebody in the store that can communicate in English to offer decent customer interaction with us English speaking Americans. Again, I will not go back to this location. I will go across the street to Harris Teeter or to Li's Banh Mi and get a much better sandwich."}
{"text":"Great service by Damon. Love the food and the attitude. Meatball Marina for the win. Love this subway."}
{"text":"I normally love their sandwiches.  This is the only \"fast food\" that I eat.  I was really excited about the Reuben.  That was a waste of $10.00.

The meat doesn't even taste like corned beef.  It is almost nauseatingly sweet.  There is no flavor to the sauerkraut.

The lady who made my sandwich was great, tho!

1 star on the Reuben.  4 stars on the rest."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service besides the fact they are efficient. No thank you or enthusiasm. It's called customer service for a reason... Get a new job if you're that miserable. There is one girl that is pleasant there, and I believe she is new. I'm giving this place two stars because duh it's subway, but the manager and employees need to learn some people skills."}
{"text":"Please spare me the details on other reviews. The 15-20 plus person line is NOT even CLOSE to being run through in 7 minutes.  Try 20 to 30 minutes, been there, done that and bought the farm. Took the grown cotton and made my own t-shirts, had them printed with: THIS PLACE TAKES FOR- FREAKING EVER.

The staff is only \"permanently\" populated with the store manager and a couple of assistants, after that, employee faces change QUITE frequently.  I do not go to this store anymore - after 4 years of going there at least 3 times a week, I had had enough of it.  

Subway is running, apparently, at such small margins that it cannot make things right, even when they are wrong.  The last time I was wronged at this particular store- and yes, I knew the people that worked there, including the store manager, Yvette - I just washed my hands of it.  Being wronged once you can brush over, being wronged several times with a total BS excuse is a non-happening event with me.  Well, it happened but it isn't going to happen anymore and hasn't in well over a year since I stopped going there and to any other Subways.  I have been a 15 year customer of Subway but they permanently lost my business and this particular Subway had a lot to do with it.

Whatever.  There are great lunch deals in that same area - LOTS of them - that walking away from this establishment was easier than I thought it would be after having gone there for so long."}
{"text":"worst customer service I've ever experienced.  I should have read these reviews before I walked in the door.  Needless to say i left while the useless staff member was cutting the bread (looked like he was in pain just having to do that)."}
{"text":"Complete let down.  How can you order food when you have no employees.

So many people came and left because nobody was working.

Sign says 24 hours.  Please put a closed sign if you don't want to serve your customers."}
{"text":"The kids that work here are extremely unsanitary.. They are rude and just plain don't care.  To be honest I love subway but this store is gross. The owner needs to fire the kids working here. Lets be real, making a sub is not rocket science. The other subway in town is 1000 times better. I'm still pissed that the kids knowningly gave me really old bread that I only discovered when I got home. I had to throw the subs in the trash. I was afraid I would get sick. Punk kids wasted $10 that I work hard for. Never again will I go here."}
{"text":"I went for a quick lunch and got flavorless meats, wilted toppings, and stale dry bread.  I should have went to jimmy johns down the street.  Fortunately, the people in front of me order the combo and was told it would be 30 cents more if they wanted a cold drink because the ice maker was not working for the fountain drinks and \"nobody knew how to load the ice\".  !!!  What a ripoff and example of poor customer service.  So I only had to lose 4 dollars for the lesson learned - go to a real sandwich shop if you want a good sandwich.  Subway is dead to me."}
{"text":"Workers are not very attentive, I've never been \"greeted\" when I enter. Often I'll say something like \"may I have a 12 inch Italian herbs and cheese bread please\" and they'll ask \"what kind of bread would you like?\" Followed by \"6 inch or footling?\". Could definitely be better with communication."}
{"text":"I might give this Subway 3 stars, but it is located in the most unwelcoming of shopping centers. There is a taxi stand there and the parking lot is always filled with taxis that speed around the lot with no regard for others. Taxi drivers are always loitering around the lot in groups smoking cigarettes in front of other business. I know they must be a nuisance to the other businesses in the shopping center because there are signs posted all over the place that say \"no taxi parking\". 

This subway is a bit hit or miss depending on who makes your sandwich. You could get the woman with the uncontrollable cough. Or you could get the guy who wipes his forehead while he's making your sandwich. Yes he wears gloves, but they lose their purpose when you wipe your sweat with your gloved hand then touch the food. If you're lucky, you'll get the guy who makes way too much uncomfortable small talk.

I will say this... this is one of the few Subways that adds ALL the veggies when you ask for ALL the veggies instead of verifying you really want each vegetable as they put it on."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a Subway BUT it's a special Subway.  How?  

It's deserted! Unlike the other Green Valley Parkway location, this place lacks the lunchtime herds of Zappos employees.  I love you, Zappos kids, but not from 12-1 p.m.  This place is also quiet the other 23 hours a day, so, you'll likely be first in line. Sucks for the owners, awesome for me.

Service-  Employees here are eerily polite (like they're friendly robots) and super quick.

Food -  It's your standard Subway.  Not exciting, not disgusting.  That's probably the best to be said about a Subway."}
{"text":"Worst subway ever!!! Didn't think it was possible. I was so pissed by the time I left."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the amount of food I got on my sub.  I ordered a turkey sub and got a few slices of meat. Then when I asked the worker for extra onions she gave me the smallest pinch of onions.  That's when I asked for more but the next time she gave me a dirty look and put about 2 more onion slivers in my sub. Before at other locations I would get a whole handful. I didn't understand why she was being so stingy with the onions. I asked for extra onions but I ended up getting hardly any."}
{"text":"The sandwiches that we ordered at this subway were so pitiful. Barely any meat or veggies. Even after asking for more spinach, I was giving 2 extra leaves of spinach. This is the second time trying this place. The first time they did the same thing. Thought I'd give this place another chance but ended up with another sad sandwich."}
{"text":"If I didn't have a wonderful husband and wonderful life full of beautiful things and graet experiences, then I might be upset about what went on with this pathetic pit of a sandwich shoppe. 
But to tell you the truth in life there are nasty people and places. When we go to them we have nasty experiences.
This slop hole is one.
Don't go to it!
That's my advice.
They are really bad. They are bad because there's a rude employee and the owner wants her there. So, I prefer to eat at places where employees are not rude and nasty.
Life's too short!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Subway's in Brighton and it was great. Unfortunately the Scarborough versions are poor. Food terrible, service worse and place smells awful. Won't go again."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! I'm here on a Sunday night after work and as I'm ready to order two elderly ladies start speaking to me in Spanish. I am fluent in Spanish but I choose not to speak it at times when I'm ordering since it's a little more complicated for me. Although they continued talking to me in Spanish and were very rude. They kept rolling their eyes every time you asked for something else, it's their job to do so! She even coughed on my food which completely killed my appetite! I still chose not to be rude and ate in the facility but as I was i don't think one of the ladies knew I was eating in the dining area and started ranting about me being so needy in Spanish! This place is a joke! I felt disgusted my whole visit! I never wanted to give a place a no star but this would absolutely go on that list!! Don't come here at all!!!"}
{"text":"Come visit us! New management, new staff! Mention this for 10% off. :)
We are striving for fresher product,  friendlier service,  and a healthier option in the mall. We'd love to help you create your perfect sandwich!"}
{"text":"We frequent this subway at least once a week.  The sandwiches are alway fresh and the service is usually great.  The sign on the door states that they close at 10:00 pm, however when we stopped by tonight at 9:45, the door was locked.  The two male associates working the store, ignored us.  We knocked louder so the turned their backs to us and then went into the back room.  I understand that good help is hard to find but employees should understand that every store has a sign inside above the door that clearly states, 'This door to remain unlocked during business hours',    Yes, we will go back to this Subway, but we are VERY disappointed in the service today."}
{"text":"This location is by far the best when it comes to customer service. Mrs. Maria is the manager of this location and I visited this morning to grab breakfast and a sandwhich for my lunch as well. Mrs. Maria went above and beyond this morning in customer service. What a blessing she is to have managing this location. Words can not express my gratitude for the service I received this morning.   This location is clean, the employees are very nice and I definitely enjoyed my experience here. Thank You Subway, and Gracias Por Todo Senora Maria"}
{"text":"Excellent Subway location! The prices are cheaper than all of the surrounding Subway restaurants and the quality of service is just excellent! The portions are great and the food tastes great! Would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time on 1/31/16 at around 11:45 pm. I had just gotten off work and was thrilled to see something besides greasy fast food was open. 

My sandwich was good....although next time I stop by ill be getting double meat. I really wish Subway would just put a little bit more meat, but that's just my beef with the company.

Anyways the five stars comes from the young man who was working the drive through. Although it was 10:30 at night he was very energetic. He totally lifted my mood. He answered all my questions politely & didn't seem annoyed. He also asked if I wanted to add chips and a drink...good up sell. I wish I would've remember to get his name but he was awesome. Next time I return I'll make sure to get it & send my compliments."}
{"text":"They make your sandwich exactly how you like it without any rudeness. They didn't constantly ask me what kind of meat I want (vegetarian ) and just moved to the next item when I said no.

Clean bathrooms are a plus"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with this Subway.  The servers are always friendly and the food is always fresh.  Parking can be a bit of a hassle if you'r not driving a Honda Civic...but it's not too bad if you aren't there for the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I had great costumer service with the girl behind the counter, however the manager was HORRIBLE! Maybe he was having a bad day but he didn't even look at my face when I asked to substitute an ingredient he just said: NO! I just wanted slices of avocado instead of cheese (I am allergic to dairy) - yeah, I wasn't asking for much here!!! The girl even thought he was talking to himself or something and she asked him again and he said another NO! He said I had to pay for it (which I gladly did cause I don't mind paying .50c) but he kept looking over the girl's shoulder to make sure she charged me. Then, asked her again: did you charge her for the avocado???

OMG!!! I don't mind paying!!! He treated me as if I were stealing avocados and he treated the girl as if she was going to (God forbid) forget to charge me .50c

Horrible for a chain to have a manager like that! I felt so bad that I decided to walk back to the hotel to eat there instead of eating in the restaurant."}
{"text":"poor communication skills and not willing to resolve issues for customers. I actually told him what was wrong and he basically said it was my fault."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the worst Subway I have EVER been to! The service was horrid, we waited almost 10 minutes to be waited on and there was no one else in front of us. They got our order wrong, the employee was incredibly rude and for the price we paid it was not worth it. When we complained to upper Management we did not get a response for over 5 days and they did not even try to offer any type of solution. Needless to say, even though this Subway is the closest to my house I will NEVER go there again and will never recommend it either!"}
{"text":"My visit today was horrible it's my 1st time here n I regret going. My husband n I got there and there were 3 people ahead of us which we were fine with that but the workers there name Jessica and Alicia were taking their sweet time making the 1st customer sandwich. They were talking crap about that guest and her friend. It literally took 40 minutes to take our orders. I asked about a salad n they answered with attitude. The 3 workers that were there need customer service knowledge cause they suck"}
{"text":"My experience with this location is don't use the online app to place your order. Paid for a 12\", got a 6\". Had to drive back to the store. And gave me sriracha sauce instead of buffalo for my sale and it was horrible. Yesterday, I went into the shop so I could watch to make sure I get what I asked for and ordered the new chicken Caesar melt prepared as advertised. Did not like it at all and definitely not worth $8! I have been eating at Subway for years and the quality and customer service at this location lacks in both. Looking for another sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Terrible Service!! Guy wouldn't even listen before he started putting toppings on my sandwich!! I hate Subway now!"}
{"text":"I've come to this subway quite often for convenience and for the most part the workers have been courteous but tonight was the exception. As I'm ordering my sandwich the woman building my sandwich is giving the customers in front of me dirty looks. When my sandwich comes out of the toaster oven the lady just sets both hands down and looks at me with an attitude, like what do want. I will continue to come here because most of these workers don't last long anyway."}
{"text":"Always old expired tomatoes, cucumbers etc... Always tight with veggies... Friendly staff however lousy subs. I'm glad subway franchise doesn't have territorial rights. So there is still like 10 more near me that have FRESH ingredients unlike this subway. I'm soon to be a franchise owner and want to open next to this one so I can fix this locations reputation. Or just walk in to smiths and buy there pre maid subs cheaper and tastier."}
{"text":"Ordered a tuna salad. The gentlemen  behind the counter was very helpful. That is up until a gal came in who walked straight up to the register and ordered coffee. I'll get back to this story in a minute. Back to the salad...
He placed all the ingredients I asked for in a bowl and began to cut/smoosh them with a blade tool. - I prefer the \"old\" way of preparing salads where this step wasn't  included. I then paid $9.26 total for the salad and a fountain drink! :-o. I. Could've paid this for a better quality salad elsewhere!  The salad is \"okay.\" 
Back to the gal who cut in front of me..
The subway attendant disregarded the fact that she cut ahead of me, failed to tell her he'd serve her after he was done with my transaction...& served her the coffee and checked her out before me! Not professional service in the least! I did not desire to create a spectacle as there were others now in line and thus I didn't say anything but this was rude of her and unprofessional of him."}
{"text":"Everyone that works here is very nice. The older gentlemen that works here, especially so. 
This morning as he prepared my sandwich, one of his regulars came in. He began attending him when my sandwich was in the oven. He then got so into making the other sandwich that he almost forgot about mine. The guy who came in behind me actually jumped me in line thinking he was going to check out first...(no chivalry to be had there)..  Anyways, right as the Subway attendant started to bag the other sandwich, he seemed to have remembered mine, finished it & checked me out first. 
Great sandwich nonetheless!! :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service. CHAD who makes the sandwiches is probably the rudest person I have ever dealt with.  My mother (who has an accent) was trying to order a sandwich and he was so frustrated trying to deal with her.  My son, decided to order for her and he even yelled at him for not know what cheese he wanted.  At the end and during checkout, my mom apologized if he was having a hard time understanding her, his response. \"It's ok I deal with annoying people everyday\".  When they came out and told me what happened I was shocked.  I got home and called to talk to manager. CHAD answered the phone. I asked him who manager was and he told me CHI but he isn't in.  I asked if he always spoke to people this way and he said \"I don't know we're they being annoying?\"  What kind of response is that.  If you hate your job that much and hate dealing with people, then don't work with the public!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Subway!  Every time I go in they are out of something. Who ever does their ordering needs to be re-trained.  I am always ordering and then the last sandwich they don't have something so I just want to walk out.  The staff seems like they are so out of it.  I live in Aliante but will drive Port of Subs instead.  This subway sucks."}
{"text":"Best subway I've ever been to-- taste wise
 They had options I've never seen anywhere else. Fast, Efficient and friendly service"}
{"text":"While not an expert at running a food establishment , I can tell that serving customers a bunch of frozen vegetables is not a good idea. In addition to frozen veggies this store is famous for not washing their hands and using the same gloves after they take money. The manager doesn't seem to have a clue how to run her store and laughed when I told her how dangerous serving frozen vegetables and not washing hands was. No washroom at this location either. I hope subway head office catches them off guard and teaches them a lesson is cleanliness and customer service."}
{"text":"Service was great and there's plenty of seating. You can get access from outside or inside. Parking is always an issue here. It's Subway. Not much to say about that. It's always not terrible."}
{"text":"Horrible service I don't like the guy \"Jose\" at all very rude I go there and he's already charging $11 for a sub I ask him how to use the coupon he says why don't you read it I told him that I didn't know what a 30oz drink looked like and then I ask him to go a bit heavy on my veggies and he rolls his eyes and throws them on my sandwich and After I asked for chipotle sauce he rolls his eyes again and he rings me Up I pay and he throws my sandwich at me overall I would never come here again and I advise you don't either"}
{"text":"I work close to this location, once and a while I stop to take lunch with me. Most the time its a pleasant experience. 7/18/2013 I stopped in because I had a coupon for a BUY ANY FOOT LONG sub and 30 Oz drink get ANY FOOT LONG equal or lesser price free. I asked for the Cold Cut Combo, then was told that didn't qualify. I then asked if I could get a more expensive sandwich and have the cold cut as the free sandwich, again denied. after the third sandwich denial I asked what I could get. I attempted to call the customer service line, but have had no returned calls. So if your not worried about deals this is the place to go, but if your avoiding locations that FALSE ADVERTISE this company does that."}
{"text":"I went to this place and asked for a salad.They came out with a bowl covered in dirt and dried mustard to put the salad in.NASTY!also this places meat is disgusting!!I got a refund and left.This place stinks.  don't go here!DONT COME HERE!"}
{"text":"I start with a 5 and then see how much things go.  So -1 for employees being so slow.  Management needs to get them some red bull.  -1 out of new bread and other types.  -1 out of sweet tea.  -1 out of some cookie types. so that leaves them with 1 star sad but coworkers say this is typical there. There are a lot of places to eat in the area, try them first.  (2:30 pm 7-7-14)"}
{"text":"I went there today to get a simple 6\" turkey sub. The girl made the sandwich really weird and folded it completely wrong. Her coworker said that girl was training, but I think even a child knows how to properly fold a sub bun."}
{"text":"I have never had an issue at this location. Service was always good, sandwiches same as any other Subway. Kind of a small and cramped location, not much room to sit down as the space between the tables and the main counter are pretty narrow. It's an ok place."}
{"text":"Subway being a chain, the food is pretty much the same throughout. Don't get me wrong, it was good and filling and at a good price point. What set this subway apart was the setting and service. The staff ( especially a gentleman named Brian) was very polite and energetic and took their time with my kidZ a BIG plus. The dining area was clean, inviting, and cozy. It was very nice out and the light coming thru the window wall was a nice change to the extremely rainy days we have been having. As my swimmer son loves subway (he traditionally eats a 12inch turkey sub) we find ourselves at some subway somewhere very often. I could see making the trek to this one more often. Keep doing what you are doing, and I assure you our appetites and our dollars will be back!!"}
{"text":"Totally awesome this place is open 24/7. It is a great alternative to late-night pizza when your visiting the Mandalay Bay Resort. Also, absolutely nothing to complain about food or service wise. Great job!"}
{"text":"24 HR Subway, convenient to cure the munchies. $5 kids meal = perfect snack"}
{"text":"The best Subway by my work so it gets 3 stars. I just can't get excited about Subway. I grew up in New York where it was all about the local deli where they slice up their meats fresh and the sandwiches are piled high. I also worked in a snobby small town for about 2 years where the only places you could get a lunch under 10 dollars were Subway, McDonalds, Dairy Queen and KFC. Subway was the best out of the bunch, but eating it straight for 2 years can cause you to burn out on a place. But I digress, what was I saying?... Uh oh yea best Subway by my work, and I will leave it at that."}
{"text":"Awful location. Every time I've gone here the bread is clearly from the day before, and apparently was sitting out in the open all night, since its disgustingly hard and dry. This morning i asked for jalapeños on the sandwich, and the lady literally took 4 small jalapeño wheels and spread them out over the footlong. Every time i order my veggie delight, they barely put ANY veggies on it. I have to keep asking for more. I'm like, \"veggies are the POINT of this sandwich\". Slow service. Will be going to a different location from now on."}
{"text":"Had the new BBQ Pork sandwich on wheat.  
I didnt toast it but I had them heat the BBQ Pork.  A little lettuce, tomatoes and extra BBQ.  

This is must have sandwich.

If you haven't tried it, try it tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Manager is utterly disrespectful. Usually don't eat subway but started craving some tuna before lunch. Got the foot long tuna so i could have some later on as it was just a bit before 12. At the end of the employee making my sub i asked to just please wrap them separately. The manager who had already cashed me out told me that he would be charge the regular price for two 6 inch subs if i wrap it individually again. I laughed and thought he was kidding and asked if he was joking. he replied \"This time ill let it go, to keep your respect but next time i will charge for 2 individual subs.\" Probably will never be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Subway is a pretty standardized franchise, their food pretty much tastes the same no matter which one you go to (well at least it shouldn't taste any different)

The only reason I'm writing this review is because the last time I went in there to eat, I ordered a sub (you don't say) and I'm a saucy boy. My Sandwich ain't Boss without da Sauce. So yeah anyways I'm there and I'm like 

\"hey buddy can i get a quick line of Mayo\"
*Squirts Mayo
\"and can I get a quick line of honey mustard\"
*Squirts honey mustard
\"a fat line of BBQ
*Squirts BBQ
\"a slight bit of mustard
*Squirts mustard
\"aaaand lets go with a line of ranch\"

the guy looks at me before he squirts the line of ranch and says \"We charge an extra 50 cents per sauce after putting two sauces on the sandwich\"

I looked at the guy and said \"since when does subway charge for extra sauces?\"

The guy replied \"We charge for extra sauce here\"

So i asked him where on the menu it says that they charge for extra sauce and he just kinda mumbled a little bit and just repeated himself in saying they charge for extra sauce. I was pretty aggravated at how he decides to mention this hidden fee after decorating my award winning sandwich with 4 sauces already. I was ready to tell the guy to start my sandwich all over again if thats the case but im not a fan of wasting food so i said whatever and paid him the extra dollar.

I'm not going to forget that guy who served me and im gonna go back one day and be like \"MAKE ME A SANDWICH\" and order all my sauces and i hope to god he tries to pull another fast one on me... because i'll be waiting."}
{"text":"This subway is located in the very back of the Casino Royale Hotel on the strip. We wanted to try something a little healthy but quick while in Vegas so we decided on this Subway since it was next to our hotel. Two footlongs cost $10 a piece but they were good. Quick service nice staff !"}
{"text":"Honestly, subway is subway. No surprises about what you're getting. But in the whole scheme of subways, this location goes above and beyond. I walk away impressed with the staff and overall experience every time I go here. They are friendly, accurate, and make excellent sandwiches, even taking care to spread the tuna salad I ordered evenly on my bread. It's a welcome contrast to not only other subways, but the general experience I have at other places in the area employed by unfriendly/rude college kids."}
{"text":"This is a smaller subway, good seating, not a very big lunch crowd when i went; parking is cramped cause of other stores in same strip.  Just ur average Subway :)"}
{"text":"It was Thursday, around 6:30pm January 18, 2018. We went to get 2 sandwiches at the Subway on Pecos and Russell. There was two young employees making sandwiches. One of the employee was on the taller side. Our problem was with the shorter employee. I have no other way to describe them because they were not wearing name tags. It was all fine and they were both very nice and polite but the problem was when we were checking out and the employee took our money and give us our change with the gloves on and then as I was walking out I notice that he never changed the gloves then he started stocking all the veggies sticking his hand with the dirty glove in the food containers. I was so surprised by what was happening I didn't think about going back and telling him just to give me my money back because who knows if he did the same thing and made change with the same gloves right before he made my sandwich. 
Of course the more I thought about it the more I could not eat that sandwich and there went some money to waste."}
{"text":"A great place to visit in Cecil"}
{"text":"Worst Subway I've ever been to in my life. Got food poisoning from a 6\" \"chicken\" sub. Missed 2 days of work and was violently sick for nearly 36 hours straight. Contacted the owner and he took zero responsibility but offered me a free meal on him! SPEECHLESS. Subway corporate didn't even bother to address my concern. I'm done with Subway for eternity. If you're still a Subway fan, good luck, but my advice is AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"This is the best of the Subways in the area. Staff is courteous, rather than robotically polite, and they give some care to the construction of a sandwich. This restaurant is also cleaner than the nearby ones."}
{"text":"Went in around 8:30p tonight (8/28) I received excellent customer and food service found the person working to be pleasant even though it was a slow night thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich I got and the conversation I had highly recommend the customer service on a Sunday night makes for a much Pleasant start to the coming week"}
{"text":"Jasper was really nice and just overall very genuine. Didn't think I'd ever describe a Subway visit as unforgettably positive,  but this one was!"}
{"text":"Had just started placing my order when I saw a cockroach scrambling across the food bins. I pointed it out to the guy behind the counter ... who didn't seem too surprised by it ... more just annoyed as if he deals with it all the time."}
{"text":"Ew, just ew. Worst Subway I've ever been too, nothing but fat people and this place was so dirty and the food was gross and stale, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I have been to many Subway restaurants before, but this one has the best tuna subs i have ever tasted. Also the service is great!"}
{"text":"Great service and the freshest of ingredients.  The guys who work here are really on top of things, and provided me with a great experience, not to mention a fantastic sandwich."}
{"text":"I've gone to this store several times during the past few months.  While the food is tolerable (it's Subway, so expect the same thing as a Subway in any town), the pricing has fluctuated (I don't think I ever paid the same price twice for the same meal).  Today, however, was the last straw.  There was a sign posted for their soup -- $2.50 for a cup / $1.90 with the purchase of a sandwich.  I had my daughter with me and she ordered a sandwich and I ordered a cup of soup.  When the owner rang up the order, he charged me $2.50 for the soup.  When I asked why it wasn't $1.90, he \"explained\" that because I was getting the soup instead of my daughter, it didn't count \"as a meal.\"

Absolute bulls*** !!!  It is this type of \"squeeze the last penny out\" kind of tactic that makes customers decide to go anywhere else.  I will never go into this store again."}
{"text":"David Giles, the manager is amazing. Talk about customer service. Every establishment should have a David Giles. Kindness goes a long way."}
{"text":"Not sure why the last person gave only 3 stars and a rave review?  this little hometown subshop does it right, they remember past customers and greet you with a smile.  The sandwiches are subway quality and there is always a local newspaper sitting around to read. There are more than 4 places to eat in Cross Plains, but not many more....."}
{"text":"Nice small Subway restaurant. The location is always clean and most of the staff are courteous. It's never busy, so it's a good option for those who need to grab food on the go."}
{"text":"Shop is larger then the usual Subway with a more open feel. Service was excellent and food was prepared to order."}
{"text":"A good Subway.  The service here is fantastic, and don't let the long lines deter you.  The lines move quickly.  Tastes like any other Subway (and I've been to a bunch).  You can get in and out quickly at any time of the day.  I go here often for lunch, and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a Reuben because it was on the website as a promotion and sent my order with my b/f who was doing the food run. Just wanted what was advertised, no frills. They gave me a random turkey sandwich with all kinds of weird toppings, not even close to a Reuben.  I called them and told them they gave me the wrong sandwich and that I was going to bring it back, so could I get the correct sandwich. They told me on the phone they couldn't make a new sandwich for me until the next day when their manager was in. (????) Really? You made a completely wrong sandwich and won't even take responsibility for it not even being close to what was advertised, incorrect meet, veggies AND bread, and if I bring in the actual sandwich WITH a receipt that said a REUBEN and the sandwich is NOT a Reuben, they still can't make me the correct sandwich until a day later?  I'm really supposed to bring in a day old sandwich to get the right one made in a day? This is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I recently had a miss-understanding and an unfortunate experience at this location. I went home and sent a note on the subway website. This location has an incredibly high rating and I understand why. I got a call from the franchise owner within 7 hours. It's apparent that this restaurant is committed to excellence and serves its community with dignity and honor. Thank you for the call, for what it's worth, it ment a lot and I felt compelled to share with the community."}
{"text":"First time going to this location. Will most likely be going to a different one in the future. The place is clean and looks really nice. Only issue I had was the person making my sandwich. I got a steak and cheese foot long and hardly got any meat on the sandwich. Once he finished toasting it he placed the sandwich on the counter and just stared at me. Usually they ask \"What kind of sides would you like\" but this guy just stared at me waiting for me to day something. Didn't really think seem like he wanted to be here. Most employees I've seen at subways use the knife to help fold the sandwich when they are done with the toppings. Not this guy. He used his hands to fold it in half. I don't plan on coming to this location again after this experience of lacking customer service.

Adding on to this review

Once I started eating the sandwich I found a piece of plastic inside it. I took the sandwich to the same guy that made it and pointed it out to him. He didn't hesitate to make me another sandwich. So in the end the customer service is lacking but the people do their job right. Because of how well he took care of the situation I will most likely come back to this location again."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst locations especially in the evenings when the employee named Christina is working there.  Incredibly bad attitude,  and manages to make even the simplest subs awful.  If you see her there save yourself the time and leave. Just go to the one down the street."}
{"text":"This is the worst subway I have ever been in I watched as an employee picked his nose did not wash his hands put on gloves and made someone a sandwich gross I will not be eating here anymore wish I could give no stars"}
{"text":"Never go on your lunch break. Understaffed and very slow, couldn't even get my salad how I wanted it because the guy behind the counter was acting scared and he was very slow!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Service. Very efficient and welcoming. The manager had a really great handle on things even when it got very busy. (think his name was Nate or tate something like that). I'll be coming here regularly"}
{"text":"Just stopped by to get a sandwich before hitting the road & the employees were quick to prepare everything  (it was 4 of us). I was very please with the service."}
{"text":"This Subway used to be good, but management must have changed because it's not good anymore. I'll never come back again."}
{"text":"Review is for food only, not service, which was fine. I guess this is more of a generalized review for ALL Subways. Went here as I was in a rush. I suppose Id forgotten how bland their offerings really are.
The bread is tasteless and light, sort of like styrofoam. I simply cannot tell the difference between the chicken, turkey and tuna they serve there. It just tastes like something cold and wet in my mouth and that's about all there is to it. The cheese is basically wax. Again, I challenge anyone to differentiate between their Swiss, provolone, American and cheddar.  As with the meat, they put only a small cut on each sandwich.
Subway still continue to load their sandwiches with shredded lettuce, which is the dominating ingredient in all their sandwiches. Just an awful meal. I strongly Subway -and its customers -  give Duck and Decanter a try. This should be the template for any company wishing to create a serious sandwich. I could make a much better one myself. In fact, that's what I'm going to do right now. Good riddance."}
{"text":"Terrible service! My husband went and bought me the new ceaser sandwich and it was dry and nasty with no flavor so he went to switch it for another sand which and the second time my sandwich was burnt toasted! Hard like a rock! Never going back."}
{"text":"There isn't really anything nice I can say about the Subway chain.  Inconsistency seems to be the only thing that is consistent.  VERY stingy with adding meat.  When I request a lot of onions, apparently two small pieces of onion qualifies as a lot.  Don't even think about asking for extra tomatoes.  It's like pulling teeth!  About the only topping they don't have an issue with generously adding is lettuce.  Yep, nothing like eating a good foot-long sandwich with bread and lettuce.  Each visit to a Subway is a frustrating struggle.  I e-mailed the company with my complaints and never got a response.  So --- if they don't have time for me, I certainly don't have time for them.  I will spend my money elsewhere.  Subway = Boo!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Subway for at least 10 years and it being one of the few lunch spots in this Anthem area, I am somewhat forced to eat here. I went there when Nicole P. was the manager, all the way through the more recent awesome managers Jovita and Claudia. The unfortunate downturn in service is disheartening. I hit probably 10 Subways a week in my service business. I eat healthy and prefer small servings, so the 6 inch subs and flatbreads are my mainstay. My complaints with this restaurant are with the new manager, who doesn't wear a name tag, but I assume she is manager because she is always there and always runs the register. I always give a dollar tip. It is just my MO. She neither acknowledges it nor has ever said \"thanks\" of any sort. But my real complaint is that virtually every other Subway in town has two options on their register screen for giving refills to Subway cup drinks. I always ask for a refill because I do my part in keeping as small of a waste footprint as possible and so I keep a Subway cup in my truck at all times. The other restaurants charge 75 cents for a small and 1 dollar for 32 ounce or 40 ounce refill. When I go to this restaurant, they deny anyone from receiving refills, and require that you buy a new cup each time and pay the full price. This is only to make more profit and this is a statement to the community that they are not \"green\" sensitive, and that they are unconcerned about the health of our planet in filling the land fills with Subway cups. Virtually all gas stations and convenience stores and fast food restaurants offer refill pricing in their cooperation to help make this planet a better place, and I do not appreciate this store not doing their part. I don't appreciate the new manager's attitude as well. Get with the program. I recommend that others complain about their money grubbing attitude."}
{"text":"I am on the road a lot with my service business, covering everywhere from Northwest, to Summerlin, to Blue Diamond, to Lake Las Vegas, to Boulder City, I am a healthy eater and so Subway is my default breakfast and lunch stop. I've been to every Subway in the Valley more than once. The Horizon Ridge Subway is my favorite. It is probably the owner who requires that the employees are overly friendly and funny and helpful because it is literally 100 percent of the time that I find exemplary service with smiles, greetings, and a service that is the best in town. There are Subways in town that are not friendly, so it is not a corporate requirement. It might be that the employees have just decided to be really fun and excellent, but usually you find that it is the top dog who is behind such quality service. Either way, I look forward to the days where timing with my hunger guides me to this restaurant when I'm doing my service route, as my business is a bit of a lone wolf atmosphere, and the guys there always make me smile and give the kind of service that is rare. I have a BA in Restaurant Management, so I am a stickler for details and I feel that I owe this establishment a minute or two of my time to return the unnecessary but appreciated extra friendly gesture and give back by saying \"thanks\". I say \"guys\" because it is always guys working at this Subway. I am sure if they get woman employees, they will be just as friendly. Check this place out. You won't be disappointed. Also, it is unfortunate that this Subway got a 4 star review from a customer who had absolutely no complaints about this restaurant. Her only complaint was price, and this store has zero control of price, so how can they be penalized?"}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of reviews but I definitely read a lot of them when deciding to dine at an establishment. We have recently moved to the area and love to get subway on Sundays but we were hesitant to come to this one based on mediocre reviews. Well we did try it and we were impressed. Lots of meat and veggies and they even accommodated my request for an extra side of sauce. The owners/employees aren't extremely friendly but are efficient and no nonsense which I appreciate because I have been to other subways where the over friendliness of employees has greatly increased the amount of time spent in line waiting to get served. 
Thank you for your hard work :) it is much appreciated!"}
{"text":"The employee who assisted me today was obviously high (obnoxiously shouting nonsense, slurring his words, and smelled strongly of marijuana). This was essentially the last straw for me.  I tend to get food from here a lot as I work nearby, often don't have the time to pack a lunch, and it's essentially the only establishment in the area that offers any remotely healthy choices.  However, my order is constantly wrong, items are forgotten, and now this.  I get that working at Subway is no one's dream job.  I don't expect you to smile at me or ask me how I'm doing or pretend that working there isn't sucking your very will to live.  All I ask is that you get my order right like 90% of the time and don't be high at work.  I don't think those are unreasonable expectations."}
{"text":"I stopped going here because they constantly have only one person working.  Subway with one person is beyond slow."}
{"text":"Service is so so slow and the two women working were very sloppy with our food and were on their phones, which I don't mind usually if there is no customers, but we were standing right in front of them. Just this once experience sucked. Usually I'm ok with it."}
{"text":"While the restaurant was smaller and darker than I'm used to, this has nothing to do with my 2 star rating.  I cannot be sure, but my review is mostly based on the manager on the clock at about 12:15pm, right during the lunch rush.  I can understand being new at a job, we have all been there, but why make the newest person on the team (and if he isn't the newest he is just the slowest) run the bread/start station?  There were clearly faster workers further down the line who would regularly go out to the dining room and clean up.  Also, the entire time we were there (more than 30 minutes) she, the manager, was sitting at a table by herself, earbuds plugged into her phone and text book open.  This was the lunch rush!  Not only wasn't she helping, but she was taking up one of a few available tables.  When she was needed she would shake her head unapprovingly and walk over to help.  At any given time there were anywhere from 3-6 people waiting in line to give their order, terrible managerial skills in my opinion.  She was focused on herself and would only take time to help when absolutely needed, or she would take a break to bark orders to the employees who were working their tails off.  We went to this location because it was slighly closer to where we work, but will not again return.  In addition, it would seem their toaster is on too high, both our subs came out hard and crispy.  There is a location about 3 miles west on Mcdowell of this location, I would recommend going there anyday over this location."}
{"text":"I love this location of Subway, everyone is always so nice and the food is always reliable! Good job guys."}
{"text":"same as other subways but this place is never busy so the workers never smile at you :( they always look so sad, miserable and bored"}
{"text":"I probably come to this Subway about once a week, since I work across the street.  They are usually busy during the lunch hours, at times the wait can be a little longer than it should, thats Sun City for you!"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe. I was the first and only customer in there. To say the woman behind the counter provided poor customer service would be an incredible understatement. I'm sure something terrible must have happened to her today to make her in such a bad mood, but the way I was talked to was worse than I've been treated since I can remember. 

Everything she said was SO INCREDIBLY RUDE and everything was with so much attitude. She was also SO SLOW MOVING. Like I said, I was the first and only customer when I got there  and it took me over 30 minutes to get out of there... 10 minutes of which was waiting at the till for her to tell me my total.

 I ordered 2 6 inch combos with fountain pops and cookies for both and I thought each combo came with 2 cookies, for a total of 4 cookies with 2 combos.... she informed me that despite what the menu said, each combo only came with 1 cookie. So I said okay cancel the 2 other cookies then, I JUST want whatever comes with 2 combos. and then she couldn't get the machine to take off my initial order I guess and she snapped at me \"LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID, THE COMPUTERS NOT WORKING IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!!!\" .. 

I look online later and it does say each combo comes with 2 cookies not 1 so I am so confused!!! 

 She also got mad, actually ANGRY at me and made me feel so stupid when I ordered \"white chocolate macadamia nut cookies\" because she told me i need to clarify weather it's chocolate or regular... well if it was chocolate I wanted I would have added in the word chocolate. But that was her reaction to everything... when i ordered flat bread she yelled (literally yelled) \"YOU NEED TO TELL ME WHITE OR MULTIGRAIN\" 

Like I said, it took me over 10 minutes with her standing at the computer trying to punch in my order (I was watching my phone timing her at this point) before I was able to pay and leave. 

I still am just in shock, I have never been actually yelled at by somebody in LONG TIME let alone somebody at a restaurant whether it's fast food or not. I don't expect great customer service at a fast food place but honestly, to be not yelled at and treated like a human being would be just perfect for me.

I came in Sunday January 15 just before 9pm, left after 9:30pm, and I would love some follow up from management about that woman. I tried looking for a name tag but she wasn't even wearing one... She is the older black lady.  I always go to Subway, but will never go to that location simply because I do not want to be treated like how she treated me ever again."}
{"text":"Mariana and her crew did a great job helping me to feed
my sons football team. They prepared 75 Subway To Go boxes and clearly marked what type of sandwiches were in each box. They were made fresh and ready on time. When I picked up the order, the restaurant was clean and decorated cute for Halloween. I will definitely use this location again!!!"}
{"text":"Don't bother coming here if you have a coupon.   Owner does not take coupons.   First location that has ever told me that."}
{"text":"It's horrible I just posted a video of an employe tilling a homeless to get out or he would stab him so I call police and they did not do nothing about it they told me I was wrong for calling that there was no treat there I have video and camera in store do too cop trying to scream at me I flat he wanted to arrest me for calling them I thing this is wrong employe shows be punished they  use the knife for our food too I hope no one goes it hire because of what happened today"}
{"text":"Placed my first online order today- I do NOT recommend it. Still had to wait in line behind the people ordering \"to go\" after being ignored by the staff there (Kinda defeats the purpose of ordering online, yes?)
I get home and open my sandwich to find that my BLT is missing a key ingredient- the lettuce! I even asked for extra lettuce and I can count on one hand the lettuce I received."}
{"text":"This Subway is the absolute worst! The staff of this place is so strange. They have the weirdest people working at this location. They are so creepy that I will never go back, This Subway is close to my house and I go out of my way several miles to go to another location. They all seem annoyed when you come into the store, half of them are usually in front of the store smoking. When they make your food, they sloppily throw it together, this place sucks! Do yourself a favor, go to another location. I have tried to contact the owners to tell them how uncomfortable the staff makes people feel but can't seem to find a phone number."}
{"text":"The employees here are so disrespectful, rude, obnoxious, mean, and every other negative word you can attribute to horrible customer service. They always rush you, even if there isn't anyone else in the store. They always close early, sometimes 30 mins early. The employees I'm referring to are usually only there during the night shift. A short brunette and taller African American. Don't get me started with the girl with blue in her hair. I have only left a couple bad reviews since I've joined yelp, and I don't do this to hurt the business. I do this so the manager reading knows that their employees are making people not come back. I have driven 10 Mins out my way just to avoid these employees. 
The people during the day are always nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The other guy that mentioned slow service is right, and here is another example of poor customer service.  Tonight after ordering, an entire group of six girls cut in front of me after I ordered and had to wait for them to each order one cookie and all pay separately.  on top of that, a father and his children's orders were also made in front of mine even while I'm standing dumbfounded by what I see.  They also acted none the wiser to what happened.  discrimination is no big deal, right?"}
{"text":"This is the best subway I have ever been to and I have been to A LOT. Place is so modern compared to most and food is fresh. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often and always get the same sandwich(veggie patty)...its easy to miss this one on the menu...but its yum!
The veggie patty is baked and has vegetable(me duh)..:)
Even when its busy, like all subways, service is quick!
Its my healthy fix and I see myself going here a lot more in the summer.."}
{"text":"This was the first local business I came to when I moved to Mesa, AZ. The first time I order here the employees were rude and impatient. I remember I sat down to eat and my sandwich fell apart. I wanted to tell them but figured they would be rude. To my surprise no one was even behind the counter, must have been in the back the whole time I sat and ate. I figured I'd try them one more time... bad move, my tuna was gross and they were still very rude. The A/C was working this time but didn't matter, I took my sandwich to go. Skip this establishment."}
{"text":"When I fist walked in the door yesterday, the first thing I noticed was a lady on her phone leaning against the counter where the food is prepared. I think she was the manager, judging by the way she talked to the employee that made our sandwiches. 

The bread was stale and very obviously not fresh. I asked for bell peppers and jalapeños and barely got any of either. They both felt as if they had been out for a while. Obviously the fridge was not cooling enough. 

Wish I could get my money back. Would NOT visit again."}
{"text":"I disagree with Jez R.  about the owner! Sounds like a disgruntled ex-employee.Been in their multiple times and have had nothing but great, friendly service! This Subway is one of the best and the cleanest that I've been in. As far as employee turnover...welcome to the fast food industry!"}
{"text":"My trusty late night dinner stop. Never a bad sandwich. Fresh ingredients. Always pleasant and helpful. Ask for Al. A true artist!"}
{"text":"Love this subway! Totally awesome people that work there!! I love going there on my lunch breaks!"}
{"text":"Food- Tried the new panini. It made everyone's jaws and heads ache just from chewing the bread. 

Service - Not acceptable. I wanted coffee/tea, the employee said they don't sell it, even though it was listed on the menu. I then said ok, I'll get a fountain drink (thinking I wanted the smaller version one 16oz). I was charged and given a 21oz fountain drink. When I asked for the 16oz, the employee said I can't get it because it needs to be made as a special request. 

I asked if I can add some extra veggies on my Panini since the veggies was less than my usual encounters with subway, the employee said no because it will make my sandwich soggy. 

Overall experience - One bad egg really should the bunch sometimes. I've had better Subway experiences, but this younger gentlemen really ruined it."}
{"text":"After many disappointing visits to this location, I will not go back. I stayed away from this Subway for over a year, but decided to give them another chance recently. On a Monday night I was in the same shopping center, so I went in and ordered some sandwiches for my hungry family. But the same issues were still  there; unfriendly Indian lady demanding all details for 4 sandwiches at once. They are always out of whatever I order.  This visit was no different. I was  told the were out of the first 2 things I ordered, she stood there with a mean look on her face as usual. Seriously? I know most items have to be delivered to them from corporate, BUT other things like simple dressings or sauces could be purchased from the grocery(across the street). In my opinion, you shouldn't take an order for a sandwich like a Reuben, and then wait til the end of the line and say \"we're out of 1000 Island.\" I could overlook a few things, but when advertised(in the window) items aren't available repeatedly, and are combined with poor customer service, I choose to take my money elsewhere!!!  The only reason for one star: a very nice young man who apologized repeatedly for the lacking items. Not a word from the lady, who I think is the owner/manager."}
{"text":"This is a good establishment with everything you would expect from a subway. Usually get your order right but there's the occasional mistake here and there. Don't do what I did, I ordered my sub and went to the cash register and the \"sandwich artist\" started adding more stuff so always watch them. They've got pretty much everything for the subs (at least that I have seen). Relatively fast and usually don't have long lines. They have a soda machine with a good variety of drinks, a bathroom too. Pretty clean and a modern design too with plenty of space. I like this subway and would come too it again."}
{"text":"Food - 4/5
Service - 2/5
Atmosphere - 1/5
Price - 4/5

Here for Breakfast - Bill was $7 w/ coffee and cookies.

I got a bacon, egg and cheese torpedo with 3 cookies and a coffee all for regular street prices - not bad indeed.

Its an airport Subway....what can I say.  Actually for being an airport food vendor this one is pretty good.  

Fast and efficient but not terribly friendly.  The sandwich maker with the repetitive \"Next in line\" and then nothing.  She gave me a look like she'd rather be getting a root canal vs. at work - its Subway what can I say.

If you traveling on Continental Express and you're in the D Terminal and need some grub - cheap - fast - and not too terribly mashed up - then come here.

But hey - its a Subway - what can I say..."}
{"text":"The cashier was very rude and they had some really bad tasting tomatoes! In addition to that the place is dirty and has some unpleasant and unprofessional staff! Not going there to have a sandwich anytime soon, there is far more sandwich shops to choose from in this city which do by far a better job customer service wise!"}
{"text":"Just left this subway location. As soon as I entered I was greeted by Sidney and he was friendly and quick! Then Joshua took over the second half of the sandwich process and was equally as friendly and helpful. I've been to this location a few times and so far this is the best service I received! It's nice to talk to a smiling face. Keep up the good work guys; it doesn't go unnoticed!"}

First off I ordered on line, which is like going thur the drive though which Actor joe pesci said it right they F you when you go thur the drive though https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V66XdulPrBM It was made yes, it was hard, cold, and I was very unhappy about it."}
{"text":"Walked in after work, after stopping by another subway which was not 24hrs anymore. I walk in an older man had sandwiches all over the counter preparing them? And a woman greets me happily. So I'm looking at the menu and the man looks super annoyed that I walked in. I start to order and at the same time he glances (super fake) towards the computer and asks me if I'm paying cash or card. (If the card machine is down wouldn't he just say, oh I can't accept cards?) I tell him card. He said super cheesy that the machine is down. I said okay. And walk out. He didn't want to help me because he had the counter full of other sandwiches. He also turned away another woman before me. Terrible service. Turning away paying customers."}
{"text":"I like Subway but this particular store has been a disappointment since it opened. 
After my third visit, I will never be coming back. 
The employees are uneducated and inattentive. 
I was told I could not have a certain type of bread that was on a rack behind the employee but when I asked, he could not give me a reason. 
The employee could not follow simple instructions then had to be reminded about warming bacon on the sandwich. 
The first time I spent 20 minuets in the drive thru only to be told the computer was down and they could only take cash. 
The second time I attempted the drive thru again but after 15 minuets I was told the employee was by themselves and they were busy. 
I drove thru without ordering and noticed no one was in the store."}
{"text":"Very poor service they were making an order ahead of us they said it'd be 10 minutes to wait and then we are sitting there waiting for 20 minutes they tell us that they're closed now that they're not going to make no sandwiches very poor service poor poor poor service do not go here"}
{"text":"I will never set foot in this place again. Your bread is not just day old it's many days old. This is the 2nd time this has happened. It had been a while from the first time and I actually forgot. Better believe I won't forget again. Maybe you have forgotten that you are in the service industry if the people are not happy..you fold up!"}

{"text":"Visited on Nov 19, 2017 around 8 PM. 

Lady working the counter wore plastic gloves to prepare sandwich and also to work the cash register with the customer before me. She came back and made my sandwich without changing gloves. 

Subway needs to have better training and oversight on ensuring employees follow proper hygienic practices."}

{"text":"You would think that over the years, reviews would improve for this place. I just came back from the place and my experience was so unpleasant. The vegetables look old...the lettuce dry, the cucumbers discolored, and the tomatoes more yellow than red. My one star isn't even about the food. It's the service. They were so rude! They ignored me, looked annoyed when I asked them questions about how much it would be extra for certain things, and took their sweet time making my sandwich even though they had three workers and just one customer.  I was never once rude to them through this whole process of getting food. I will never go back to this location. If Subway is a service job, I wonder how these gals even got hired."}
{"text":"The Graveyard guy Rob is great. He is always friendly and makes it how you want it. I Love the Cookies. Chocolate chip and Raspberry cheesecake Cookies are the best."}
{"text":"WORST SANDWICH I'VE EVER EATEN!!!

Okay, I'm not really a picky eater, but I do know what I order.
When I arrived, I was the only customer and an employee named Christopher was baking the breads. After he cleaned up a little, he came to me and asked what I wanted. I noticed he was wearing the same pair of gloves he was using when baking. I asked for my usual Italian bmt on wheat with provolone cheese. He only put 2 of the 3 meat that is usual on my sandwich. Before he put on the cheese, he stopped to bake the breads he was working on prior from my arrival. Twisting knobs, opening doors and cabinets WITH THE SAME GLOVES then continued on to my sandwich. I asked for it to be toasted and it came out burnt (I didn't notice till I got home). When it came to the veggies, same thing; sandwich, then twisting knobs, open doors, open cabinets, back to my sandwich WITH THE SAME GLOVES!! For condiments, honey mustard and mayo that's it. He had a hard time finding the condiments because the mayo was in the honey mustard container and he had to guess where the honey mustard is by guessing it's color. When checking out, I paid in cash. Counting my change, handing me my receipt, SAME DAMN GLOVES!! HE NEVER ONCE CHANGED HIS GLOVES NOR EVEN WASHED HIS HANDS PRIOR MY ORDER!!

Got home, opened up my wrappings and my sandwich was upside down (no big deal kinda but still upsetting) bread is burnt to where my teeth was hurting for the first half, and it was a mess!! Like unwrapping a salad!!
I felt so unsatisfied. If I wasn't so hungry, I would've just left and gone to another subway. Wouldn't recommend this place even to my enemies.
I'm not a picky eater. But I do still want a good sandwich. Smh first and last time coming here."}

there is a metal ramp as you enter the door and it looks dirty

{"text":"This is the closest Subway to home, and is conveniently located in an easily accessible strip mall. The store is always very clean and organized, and the people working are friendly and helpful. My only issue with this location is that it is very slow sometimes and gets crowded if there is a rush. Otherwise, it's a solid location"}
{"text":"Five...five...five dollar foot longs. This song is very catchy indeed. However the footlongs do not catch my taste buds for long.(no pun intended) Do not get me wrong the bread is fresh and so are the vegetables. The cold cuts? Hmmm not so sure. The grilled chicken pieces they use for the sandwiches, I do not trust. It looks like soy meat. I know it is only $5.00 but for the amount of money I spend on four subs I cold buy sandwich ingredients from the grocery store that will probably last me a week. Better quality too."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, good food, no complaints. I was able to get in and out in less than 10 minutes during the lunch rush on a weekday. That's tricky to-do in downtown phoenix."}
{"text":"Clean, Friendly service.

Hard to understand them sometimes but thats okay cause theyre nice.

My favorite one to go to on this side of town."}
{"text":"I work in the mall so I generally go to the Subway in the food court to eat. On 2/18 when I tried to pay using a coupon that had an expiration date of 2/18, the boy at the register would not let me use it. He kept insisting that I couldn't use it, finally pointing to the date on the coupon saying, \"I've already had to tell several people they couldn't use it because the expiration date is 2/18.\" I said'Yes. That's today, so I can use it.' He said 'No you can't. It expired today.' I asked to speak to his manager and was told she wasn't in and there was no way to reach her. I bet if the building were on fire she could have been reached! I work customer service so I know this is not how you treat customers. Especially not one that has been in there several times a week for many years. Through it all, I kept a calm, pleasant voice with a smile on my face because I didn't want to create a scene.  Finally I told him he could keep the order, and walked out. It will be a cold day you-know-where when I set foot in there if he's working.
On a separate note: since the franchise has changed hands, the place is not kept as clean. They look at you like you're crazy if you ask them to clean a table. More disturbingly, the help (usually the guys) do not wash their hands after working the register, going outside, or doing other tasks. They reach into the glove box and pull out new gloves around the middle, rather than at the cuff, thus handling what will touch my sandwich with their dirty hands. Why even bother with gloves? This is probably a Health Dept issue.
Other than that, the food is great!
***************
FOLLOW UP- I contacted the corporate office and later the store manager called me to apologize, honor the coupon and, to say that employee has been set straight and that all employees are going to attend a meeting about customer service, and cleanliness. Thank you ma'am. I hope to see the changes soon."}

Who eats a sub without meat?"}

No flatbread in the morning for a breakfast sandwich, no wheat bread at noon for lunch, soda dispenser was out of syrup and no one knew how to replace it despite already purchasing a drink, and no one knew how to refund my money for the drink).  Service is slow at lunch, took me 45 min to get through the line.  I lunch at subways all the time and never have this problem, only at this location.  Despite living within 2 min of this location, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always good. This visit was really good. We got 2 footlong tunas and was great. First time getting the tuna. Maybe it was the mix of the tuna with everything else. Whatever it was really good. Gota try the tuna at least once. We have a new favorite."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many different Subways and this place is like no other. And not in a good way. I knew as soon as I started to unwrap my sub that something was wrong. The \"fresh baked bread\" was so hard and crunchy it wasn't edible. And how many different toppings can you be out of at one time?  I'd be embarrassed to keep telling customers that you are out of so many different things.  Big waste of money. We will never go back here."}
{"text":"Cette sandwicherie est accessible à partir de l'autoroute et de la 32e Avenue. Elle est située au sein des Galeries Lachine. Un Subway comme tous les autres, mais aux biscuits toujours aussi bon! ;)"}
{"text":"I frequent this Subway quite a bit. They have great staff (always friendly) and most importantly, they put some effort into making the sub. They don't skimp on the toppings either. I am yet to have a sub here I don't like!!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today and they were out of BREAD.  The lady offered me Honey Oat or Southwestern Spicy Bread.  I told her I don't like spicy food and then the manager came over trying to sell me on the spicy bread.  I told her I would just go to the Subway on Kyrene.  This was my first time at this Subway, I was in the area and opt to go to this one because the one on Kyrene always has long lines, now I can see why.  I mean who runs out of bread at 11:55AM on a weekday???   Any sandwich store that runs out of bread at the top of the lunch hour is managed very poorly.   I'm giving them 2 stars cause the lady was very nice, store was clean and not busy at all.  I just want to add incase their reading, \"yes I noticed the whole rack of white bread on the rack. Not sure why I was told you were out, but it was obvious the young lady wanted to offer it to me. However the manager was standing guard of it\"."}
{"text":"For a simple chain sandwich shop this business really shines. It's not gourmet, but the sandwich's are pretty good. Here's why I gave it four stars: 1) they taste good, 2) the prices are reasonable, 3) the work area is clean, 4) the sandwich's are made fast and 5) the employees are personable. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great customer service, food is made to your liking. The only negative is, I wish they could do something about the bums infesting the area. It can be a little bit of a deterrent when females go in alone."}
{"text":"Bad review for the worker, Laura, in Subway this evening. While my children and I were eating our dinner. Laura is helping a white customer cheerfully, when her co-worker says he shut the lights off in the case so she can start cleaning it, jokingly. So she comes back with, \"Well the last time I checked, the color of my skin is white.\" She chuckled it off. Her coworker didn't hear, so she asks him, \"Did you hear me? I said the last time I checked my skin color was white.\" They both laughed. 

I was livid, I went right up to Laura and told her what a disgrace she is to be laughing and cracking racist jokes. She tried to say it was a joke between her and her coworker. So it's okay then? She shouldn't clean because her skin is white, as opposed to????? Black skin? Brown skin like my children and I? And in a public setting? Go crack your racist and ignorant jokes somewhere else. This is 2016, people. I will NEVER go to this location again. Horrible situation for my kids to witness."}
{"text":"The store is closed after midnight.But,on the door is a very big sign that says :OPEN 24 HOUR.Very disappointed!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service could not be any worse at this location. We arrived about 9:30 p.m., which was 1/2 hour before closing time, but they already had the wet floor cones out and the floor was sopping with mop water. When we got to the counter, TWO employees were standing there, but neither of them bothered to look up at me to ask what I would like to order. I specifically stood there silent waiting for one of them to speak to me, and neither did. Finally, I asked if I could place my order and one girl replied, ok, but still never looked up at me. I told her my order and she couldn't have been less enthusiastic if she tried. I don't expect cartwheels and high fives, but eye contact and a Thank You would have been nice! Avoid this location if you can drive 1.5 miles to the other Gilbert store."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm reviewing a chain restaurant. I ate here 3 times a week - it's location makes it awesome. You can grab a sandwich for 5 bucks and go to class. In fact I went here so often i knew most of the workers - most are nice and do their job well. over roasted chicken breast oh how i love thee."}
{"text":"Bad start as soon as I opened the door. The bell that goes off is about level with your ear and must be turned all the way up as it was SO LOUD! I make eye contact with a woman sitting in a chair behind the counter on the phone. She glances up when the bell goes off then looks away. I go up to the counter and she CONTINUES TO TALK ON THE PHONE. She doesn't even acknowledge my presence. After waiting for a good two minutes for her to do her job I ring the bell that is sitting on the counter. I hear her continue to talk on the phone. After about another minute she stands up and walks in front of me STILL on the phone. Finishes her story then hangs up. 'Christina' as her name tag reads then continues to make the worlds slowest sandwich and just dumps all the ingredients on one part of the sandwich. Classy"}
{"text":"I went into this location last night 11.3.15 at 11:30pm and had the worst service you could possibly have in a fast food joint. Savannah was the name of the person making my sandwich and she was the worst employee I ever came across in this place by far. I don't know if she hates her job or she was just missing out on a party last night but I will never go to the place again because of how crappy her service was. She was throwing the topping back into the trays and everything I asked for it seemed like I was putting her out by asking for. She proceeded to make my sandwich and when I asked for mayonnaise she said \"really\" and started to smash my sandwich down at that point I didn't even want the sandwich anymore and I told her she can throw it out and we went to winchells and got donuts instead. I do not recommend going to this place late night if you want quality service!!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times (most recently today for lunch) and there will NOT be any future visits.  Every single time they have been out of something.  Today they had no meatballs (kids were disappointed) and no sauerkraut for the Ruben.  I guess it was entertaining to watch the employees flirt with each other instead of focusing on my sandwich.  When I got home they totally had forgot the mayo I wanted on the Spicy Italian.  Normally I would have watched them making the sandwhich, but the employee I was paying couldn't seem to focus on the register instead of the bread girl and I had to make sure I was even getting charged correctly (which I wasn't).  :\"}
{"text":"Pretty strange to be told by an employee making a sandwich that he would be fired if he added any more pickles!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Subway weekly for at least the last 3 months now and have done the receipt-survey several times but after seeing previous Yelp reviews on this Subway I see that I need to put my 2-cents in as well.

In contrast to previous reviews, I have received very good customer service at this Subway location and the food has always tasted great for me and been of good quality. Even if there is a line, it has always gone by very quickly and before I know it my sandwich is done and I'm on my way. My favorite subs are the Tuna and also the Buffalo chicken ft. longs which I rarely stray away from. The manager Alex is a friendly, patient person and is bilingual (English/Spanish). Personally, I have not experienced anything inadequate or unsatisfying with this Subway location like some of these reviewers have in the past 1-2 years, and definitely would recommend this Subway to any of my friends or family (or strangers) who are in this area and looking for a quality sandwich at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"This owner needs to train his staff. And stock his inventory. One untrained worker handling people. No more Chipotle sauce. Hard bread. Seriously."}
{"text":"Do NOT go here!!! Horrible, rude workers! I walked in 30 minutes before close and was denied service because \"Food was already put away\" don't waste your time at this location, go to another that will treat you nicely!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and fast service! I go in around closing and they are always really nice and accommodating! Never act like I am intruding, only subway I'll go to!"}
{"text":"Went to grab a veggie salad. Waited 20 min to be helped. There was one couple in front of me. Absolutely the slowest service I have ever received from Subway. Didn't have 2 of the dressings that I wanted and once she was done with the salad, the employer let me know that they didn't have salad lids. Since I was picking it up to eat  later, it would have been nice to know they couldn't cover my food. Will never be returning here again."}
{"text":"They dont even deserve one star they have a roaches infestation and the owners dont even care the y know roaches aré crawling around and aré on the food sur faces and they dont care if they were to be in the customers food either there aré roaches egg sacs over by the sink where employees  put gloves  on YUK!"}
{"text":"I come to this Subway frequently since it's close to my house. I come on different days and different times, and I find it consistent that the service is really slow. The times I've been here there's only 2 employees and they usually don't seem in too big of a rush to make sandwiches even with several customers in line. I will keep coming back due to location convenience, but just an observation."}
{"text":"Sandwich was good but I told the employee twice what kind of bread I wanted and he still got it wrong.  Slow service on a non busy day and he spoke so softly I could barely hear him. I didn't think it was really possible to have a bad experience at subway but this guy pulled it off."}
{"text":"Subway is Subway... decent, cheap sandwiches.

When I'm in the mood for Subway, I make sure to go to this one because they always have the bags of kettle chips that I love. I don't often see these at other Subways for some reason."}
{"text":"I lllooooovvvvveeeeee Subway but in all the subways I have gone to this is the most convenient and most reliable one I go to. They know me so well busy now and they know the two types if sandwiches I get and they are in the process of figuring out my hubby's. I always get asked about my school and day.  I had a bad day on Tuesday and went to go get some lunch and they really turned my day around making sure to get me to smile before I left. The facility is clean and well kept, even the new workers who don't know me as well make sure my sandwiches are perfect as possible.  I reccomend this subway :)"}
{"text":"Used to go to this subway all the time. But stopped going after I got extremely sick. They're employees always gave off the vibe that they hate their job and this one employee moves soo slow. Expect to wait a half hour if he's making your sub. And he also gave me a huge thick slice of turkey (it was the end) and I was just disgusted so I decided to stop going their."}
{"text":"Health department will be contacted tomorrow! 

Worst customer service ever, been here 4 times and every time they drop our cheese or meat into the trash and pick it up and put it back on our sandwich. Can't ever get ahold of the manager. She doesn't ever call back. Tried calling 4 times today and they keep hanging up. I've called corporate office on another store and they don't do anything. I used to love subway but I guess I will take our money else where. Can't get good customer service anymore. Employees are rude! And food is hella nasty!"}
{"text":"We go in here very often and they always treat us great. Some of the employees know me and my brothers by name. They always greet us as we come through the door."}

{"text":"I go to this subway all the time, I am practically friends with the manager. But if I ever come in the afternoon there's one worker who seems to be incompetent and it's hurting their business. I will say \"guac\" then she puts on lettuce. I understand it's hard to hear sometimes but when you continuously put things on my sandwich when I don't ask for it, that is kinda ridiculous. Other than that, they are fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I was a little upset tonight after paying $6.25 for a Tuna Salad.  The salad only reached the second ridge from the bottom of the bowl.  It looks like a finished salad.   The restaurant was clean and the employees were nice but I didn't order a \"Petite\" salad.  I don't think they make a lot of salads here as the young man making my salad didn't know where the \"bowl\" for making them was."}
{"text":"This facility is decent, even though half of it isn't there anymore due to a collapse. Still, what remains is well maintained although it could be a bit cleaner.

I do like that the change rooms have field access and that there is more than ample seating for all the fields. Parking is good too however it seems like the walk in is further than at other centres.

The washrooms here are old and need a few basic repairs (door latches etc). They also aren't the cleanest.

While it is nice to have a brand name eatery on site (Subway), I found the smell coming from it can be a bit processed and overwhelming if you are watching a game on the closest to the entrance field.

They have an equipment store onsite which is smart if stuff is forgotten -  a given if you are dealing with kids.

The fields could use a bit more lighting...both from a player and spectator perspective."}
{"text":"Came to this place cause it was nearby...havent had subway in a while so I get here and the 2 workers just chatting it up so I wait til there done and the whole order I had to repeat my order to her 3 times she wasn't paying no attention drowned both my sandwiches in mayo and mustard after asking for light mayo and light mustard...i was just ok it's fine then am paying and the other lady starts to make remarks about my order in Spanish like if I don't understand so I stayed quiet...as I hear them running their mouth in Spanish and they have the nerve to tell me bye after all the s$%$ they said...never again really disappointed people here have no professionalism and I guess no accountability cause the next customer came and as I sat there and listen and they talk about every customer ...THEY REALLY THINK NO ONE UNDERSTANDS THEM"}
{"text":"Unless you're coming for one of the classic subs, avoid this place as they are skimpy of the portions of meat and garnish.

Back when they had the lobster roll, it ended up a lobster flavoured surimi salad rather than a real lobster meat salad."}
{"text":"Drudging another breakfast at Tim's, I decided to check out the Subway location at the Park Hyatt.  It was early, before 8 a.m. on a Sunday, so I was expecting the store to be closed.  But it turns out that this Subway is a 24 hour location - the first I've heard!

Breakfast here is also my first.  I ordered an Egg & Cheese footlong which is a new entrant in the reincarnated $5 footlong promotion.  As you may know, $5 footlongs are back while the $6 Sub of the Day promotion has been eliminated.  From a marketing perspective, $5 footlongs must have been much more of a success.. I mean, more inexpensive and a better jingle? It's a no brainer.

I am still not happy with Subway though.  The shuffling of promotions created a casualty a of war - the meatball sub!  While most of the original subs on the $5 lineup return (Cold Cut Combo, Egg Salad, Ham, Pizza with Cheese, Veggie Delite) the meatball sub does not!  In my opinion, it was the best sub in taste and value at the time...hats off to you meatball sub.  Instead, a footlong meatball sub is now at $5.75 in Canada.  Is it too late to boycott?

I had the Egg & Cheese footlong on an Italian Herb and Cheese with lettuce, tomatoes, green peppers and ranch sauce.  The sub tasted very much like a Western sandwich you would get at Harvey's except on different bread.  It was great to have egg on both sides of the bread.  They basically took a round egg omelette and cut in half for each 6 inch length of sub.  The egg was less artificial tasting than I expected - much less than you would get at McDonald's but more than at Harvey's (where eggs are cooked at the time of order).  The egg could have benefited from some salt and pepper though which I forgot to add.  I got my sub toasted so that the cheese would deliciously melt over the eggs.  I would get the sub again for breakfast but instead on flat bread for a better crunch.

The music in the store was too loud - perhaps it's to ensure that the sandwich artist stays awake for the night shift?  Fortunately, my sandwich artist was very friendly especially for such an early morning.  She also did a good job upselling me a coffee after seeing how tired I was.  My Seattle's Best coffee was more watered down than it should have been though."}
{"text":"After running around I was hungry.   I was looking for a fast food place, you know, quick and easy.   But as I was driving along I see this Subway and think \"you know, this will work much better then a burger!\"

Now that I have a smart phone, I tried looking this place up so I could check in, but I couldn't find it, so I get an FTR, YAY!  
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/subway-sandwiches-phoenix?select=JX98_a_O5wNUKfULdvB5jg#rZIyUf7tGRYiBtG4_Wn3_w

Remembering all the commercials for the \"$5 foot long\" I wanted one of those and decided on Black Forest Ham with pepper jack cheese on the herb & cheese bread.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/subway-sandwiches-phoenix?select=JX98_a_O5wNUKfULdvB5jg#4HxGhjvyQW1ZXt3jViHxDA

It was fresh and tasty EXCEPT the bread.   The inside was nice and soft, but the out side was dry and crusty as if it had been sitting around a while, as if it were \"day old\" bread.

Otherwise I was very happy with my sandwich!"}
{"text":"February is $5 foot-long month! With the exception of the Pastrami and Philly Cheese Steak, which is fine with me! I'm more of a cold cut/black forest ham fella. Plus I've been trying to cut down on how much money/calories I use/consume on lunch, so it's a win win situation for me. 

I been to this place more than a few times always on lunch break. The staff is really cool and always greet with smiles. Lately I'm hooked on the cold cut combo with 9 grain honey wheat bread. Add on all the fixings and I'm set. 

Goes well with jalapeno kettle chips and water."}
{"text":"Their hours are listed incorrectly, I called them and the lady that answered said they are already closed.

I don't understand why businesses lie about their hours here on Yelp."}
{"text":"This subway has lists of wrongs: they do not change their gloves, they constantly hold conversations with each other while tons of people are needing help, I have personally had my cards thrown on the counter and my hand is clearly out, today I had to tell the sandwich maker 4 times what I wanted and the cashier twice what soda I wanted due to them holding conversations, and the list goes on. So sad how this subway treats people and clearly do not have customer service etiquette."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best Subway I've been to in the Phoenix metro area.  I've eaten inside before, as well as done online ordering.  The dining area is always clean, and the staff are fast and friendly.  Online ordering is a breeze, and it actually works.  At another Subway location, I had them lose my order once.  This location has their you-know-what together - they had my order waiting for me when I arrived, and it was fresh and exactly what I had ordered."}
{"text":"C'est Subway, que dire de plus?"}
{"text":"Agreed with other reviews... they try to nickel and dime you. I'm not sure if staff are told by management to be \"skimpy\" on the veggies, but they don't put a lot on. Then when you ask for more, I feel like it is a burden for them. Plus I feel like their selection of $5 subs are less then other locations (could be wrong because I haven't eaten at a subway in a long time). All in all, customer service is lacking to save a little money."}
{"text":"To the woman who made my skimpy sandwich, your 'Anything else?' repeatedly was toned very rude.  I understand if you don't like your job but don't take that out on me..as matter of fact I won't let it happen again. I just won't be back in...you have too many competitors around you that WANT MY BUSINESS."}
{"text":"when im trying to some what eat a little \"healthier\" i always come by this Subway for a delicious sandwich!  now, when I was younger and my dad would take me to Subway i always disliked the experience because for some reason i always had rude people making my sandwich, telling me to speak up or just overall making me in comfortable while trying to put my sandwich together. not at this place!! every person that works here has a super awesome attitude! (which is even better considering some assholes ive seen these people deal with while ive waited in line) my favorite person at this shop is Hilda, who I actually met on her first day, she seemed so nervous but was very polite and intently listened to what you asked of her. now when my room mate and i debate on going to subway, we just say 'should we go see Hilda?'. :) 
food itself is good, never once have gotten sick from the cold cuts, veggies are never wilted, and they always have the bread i want in stock even when we stop in at 2am for a drunken meal. the only sub shop for me!"}
{"text":"jog here every other morning for my lunch after i finish exercising and can't complain about this location, everyone is friendly as far as I can see but they're not too talkative. (but then again I do walk in covered in sweat after running for 2 miles so im busy catching my breath and cooling down) knocked off 1 star from this location because one morning I ran all the way to the front door 47 minutes after they were supposed to open and the doors were locked with no sign of life inside. late shift worker? not too sure. aside from that's it's an alright location."}
{"text":"Worst Subway ever due to poor, lazy customer service.  Fat chic making the sandwich was too damn lazy to take 2 steps to the side to put another topping on my sandwich because I changed my mind?  WTF.  She was stingy and wouldn't give me a cup for H20; fat bitch.  She asked me what kind of cheese x3 so I yelled I'm thinking!  This is during the loud casino noise in background.  Eat my stinkin' cheese."}
{"text":"This used to be a really good subway! We would come here late at night when it was 24hrs and the guy making sandwiches was great! Unfortunately that's all changed, I didn't yelp the first time because I really don't do this, but this is ridiculous... There's a new employee, heavy set male, and this is the second time now that he's \"shut the toasters off\" and \"ran out of bread\" 4 hours before closing. I will never waste my time coming here again, the extra mile is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Switched to this subway from the one on Lindsay and Broadway (they skimp on every ingredient). The VV and Southern location gives the appropriate amounts and are very friendly."}
{"text":"The staff here has obviously never heard the phrase \"Check your attitude at the door.\"

We purchased from this Subway in late June during our stay in Vegas, and watched as the \"Sandwich Artists\" belittled people for not understanding which side of the shop to line up on. In fairness to the customers who were confused:

A. There was no sign which clarified with side to start on.
B. There was an influx of people standing around, making it difficult to ascertain the ordering process setup.
C. Many of the people in line didn't appear to be from America, and possibly have never even been to a Subway.

Despite this, the staff seemed more than content in making disparaging comments among each other, and rolling their eyes when addressing questions from first-time customers who had difficulty with English.

If you can't handle routine customer questions/confusion, you probably shouldn't be working in customer service."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Subway.  Go here for lunch every now and then on weekdays.

Only minor complaint.  They do that really annoying thing where when you walk in they yell \"Welcome to Subway!\"  I hate places that do that.  I'm never sure if I should just nod, ignore them, or yell back \"Thank You!\""}
{"text":"Not to be mean man but the guy who works here that has a gross rash on his arm makes this super unappetizing to me. I think they started making him wear long sleeves but still, I came here once while he was still showing the rash and I walked out. Came back and unfortunately he was there again but this time with a long sleeve on. I let him make my sandwich and he didn't even do it right. He's extremely sloppy. AND he did NOT change his gloves. He was touching the oven and all types of stuff without changing his gloves. Honestly, subway needs to learn how to hire people who look presentable specially when you're making food right in front of the people who are buying it smh. Do NOT go to this location.."}
{"text":"Already placed numerous complaints on this Subway location through their website and nothing ever gets done. Subway needs to get it together with customer service. And this location is a joke. Theres an older white woman who works there. I don't know if she is or was on drugs but she seems jittery every time I go there. Last time I was there on 3/11/16 she was sick as a dog and kept coughing into her arm while making sandwiches which was disgusting. Not sure why they let people work if they're sick. She's terrible at making sandwiches either adds too much of something or not enough and has a BAD attitude like anything you say or ask her for bugs her. They have no customer service training and their employees look miserable. Manager doesn't give a damn about what you complain about. He called me once after I complained, seem nonchalant like his employees did no wrong. If this wasn't the only subway close to my job, I'd go elsewhere."}

{"text":"All of the subways in Mesa AZ have been getting worse while the prices keep going up.  Customer Service doesn't exist.  They rush you.  They don't listen to you and end up making mistakes like putting the wrong mustard on the sub.  I have seen a lot of times in both stores #108 and #102 (on McKellips and Greenfield and the other McKellips and Recker) where the knife being used to cut the sub in half isn't clean!
I usually order the Chicken \"Tender\" sub. It's not even on the menu so the price differs but most of the time it is $8.75 or $9!  The Club which has slices of Roast Beef, Ham & Turkey is the same or less.  With the \"tenders\" all of the stores have been shorting the sub, meaning you take bites and all you get is BREAD because there is not enough Meat!  For $9 there should be more than enough meat.  I am giving up on Subway."}

{"text":"LATINO KID MAKING THE SANDWICHES IS A FUCKING IDIOT!!!! Had a 30 minute lunch break and decided to stop at this location since it was convenient. I told the guy I wanted a tuna sandwich, but noticed the tuna was almost finished. I asked this idiot if they had more tuna since it was obvious to anyone with common sense it was time to bring out new tuna. His response was yes, but instead of going back to get the tuna he continues to try and scrape the last bit of tuna out of the current bucket. The sandwich was obviously missing tuna, so I guess he was going to try and fill it with veggies as if I was a vegetarian or something. I explained to him that sandwich wasn't going to work for me, and asked him to make another sandwich. When I am paying full price for a sandwich I want it to be made correct, and if that's not possible let me know the reason. I think they were out of tuna personally, but he just didn't want to say. This area of town is rather \"ghetto\", and I guess customer service obviously isn't on their to do list. #HORRIBLE SERVICE #STAYAWAY"}

Don't try and save money but yet and still charge the customer  the same price for old meat and veggies. Shame on this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Like others have said just poorly run, I don't expect much from a subway but this place just seems to put no effort at all. Employees are unprofessional, which is on the management. Feel bad because it's clearly not very busy, so it's not like they're getting away with it, can't see how it stays in business."}
{"text":"Visited this place cause its healthy and close to work. While ordering the Tuna cause it's Friday I asked there are 3 price levels for your salad, I imagine the double chicken is the $7.25 price what are the $6.00 and $5.00 salads? The guy's response was it goes by the sandwiches and those change ever day. I responded it then goes by the different meat put in the salad....which is what....he still could not tell me....his only response was....you basically have to wait till you order then see what the register rings up.  That still doesn't make sense to me...what if I have limited money...I want to order within my budget of a $5.00 salad but they can't tell me what that consists of....is it Ham? Meatballs? Tuna?  Veggies? Am I just not getting it or is it how the menu reads?"}
{"text":"Came in at 6:45 on a weekday store was empty other than me and one other person. Asked cashier to give me a couple extra napkins so I could wipe down a table that I going to sit at. She gave an eye roll and when I asked for a water cup she gave another eye roll. Food was good I mean it's subway it's pretty consistent. This place is what you'd expect - 3 Stars"}
{"text":"The employees were very nice and had great customer service, the food wasn't 5 star restaurant but it was good. The actual lobby was clean well kept too."}
{"text":"Traveling, I stopped in at this subway knowing I could get a decent vegan salad. The two employees were extremely rude. I asked for the salad to be a chopped version (basically chopping it in a bowl) they said it was too early to bring out the bowl. Really? I understand if I was asking for some specific lunch item that wasn't prepared but a bowl? And, being vegan, I just want veggies.... Everything that you already have out. I have never been to a subway where I was treated so poorly. I guess they don't care about repeat business because they are in an airport. Just avoid."}
{"text":"I agree with Andrew T.  When my wife and I walked in, right away we felt like we were disturbing the two female employees' social hour.  There was No, \"Hi, welcome to Subway\", better yet, no response and/or acknowledgement at all.  Last time I checked, customers at any business makes the paycheck.  Also, when we finally got service, we were quickly rushed, and ofcourse no \"Thank you\".  I only gave one star to the fact that nothing was wrong with our food, but really how can you mess that up when the customers are telling them what we want on our subs."}
{"text":"Febuary 1st, 2018. 11:40am. Worst sandwhich i have had. The woman there was very rude. I cannot remember her name but it started with an \"M\". I asked for my sandwhich toasted and she only put it in for about 15 seconds. She basically just threw all of my ingediants on the sandwhich making it really really messy. When i pulled the sandwhich out all the ingrediants spilt everywhere and there was her finger makes left on the bread because she squeezed it so hard."}
{"text":"I feel like this particular location doesn't get a lot of business so the bread tends to be somewhat stale if you aren't there right at peak hours. I think they're aware because it seems like they're getting better but I still can't bring myself to give more than an average score. Not to mention... I literally have never seen an adult behind the counter. I'm pretty sure this store is run by 16-17 year olds."}
{"text":"This location gets two stars instead of one because the staff is usually friendly. I've been here dozens of times, usually at night being the only person there, and every time seems like I step into another universe where time moves at 1/4 speed. It's legitimately painful to watch how slowly they put stuff on your sandwich.

Toasted sandwiches with extra meat usually come out cold, staff never puts enough veggies but lets the mayo rain, ends of the sandwich are always dry with nothing in them.

You'll spend too much and wait too long for a sandwich that's not that great."}
{"text":"Located right on the strip and still honors the $5 footlong deal. A wise man would get 2-3 of these and bring them back to the room."}
{"text":"The service today and a few times ago sucked. :(. The girl faith has a bad attitude. If you don't like your job then get out of  customer service. I just might go to a different subway. Even though this is extremely close to my work. :("}
{"text":"Hands down WORST Subway EVER. Please take this required 1 star from Yelp and add a negative sign in front if it. From the first visit to the last the service has only saddened. We live in the area and my children rather enjoy Subway so on our way home from school on special days we will often stop for a quick sandwich. The older Hispanic lady that seems to live there (she's the only employee I ever see) completely loathes her job and she doesn't try to hide it at all. I've watched her with our family and other customers to first see if it's just us she doesn't particularly like, NOPE, she just hates her job. She makes all of the customers feel like we are an inconvenience to her because we have chosen to order a sandwich, or Gawd forbid 3 sandwiches. Once you respond to her rude \"what do you want\" request while you're waking up to the counter to the point that before you've even finished saying \"pickles\" she barks out \"what else\" repeatedly until you really just don't want to add any other ingredients to your sub in fear of the wrath of her next \"what else\" because trust me, past asking for 2 simple things like lettuce and tomato you're going to get more and more attitude. I just feel like it shouldn't be an inconvenience for an employee to do their job. I have tried several times to see if it gets better but like I said, it only gets worse. Reading the other reviews for this location I see that everyone shares these thoughts. Maybe the manager or owner should pick up Yelp and do some damage control before they are left wondering why they haven't had any customers for the last month. I know our family will not be returning."}
{"text":"There was a large confusing order ahead of me that the staff handled very efficiently. I stepped up and showed my electronic coupon. The clerk stated it would be handled at the register. When I had completed my order the clerk start to enter my order into the register the clerk could not find anywhere to enter the coupon.  He looked at it closer and stated it was only good at participating stores and they were not participating in the discount. The owner/manager came out and the clerk explained what had happened. The manager stated that I should let them know that I had the coupon before I ordered. Both the clerk and I stated that I had. Then the manager stated that they would honor the coupon. I give the service 5 stars .  Not because it was perfect, but for the way that they handled the problem."}
{"text":"I have been to this place about 8 times since I moved to Goodyear, And 8 out of 8 Times its always been a disappointment, I do not write reviews but this one needs it.... They skimp on all of the Meats, ALL of the meats, more than any other place, the service is great and the people are so nice, but they do not give you enough, and 6 out of 8 times the toaster Burns my bread, They do not have all the toppings and want you to wait 5 minutes for them, because they have none, even when you're the only customer in the building and they are slow. UN-organized, cheap on the meats, I have never EVER had a good sub from this particular shop. I will never return, today was the last time I get screwed out of my money. Moving on...."}
{"text":"They served my sandwich on a bun that was so over done that it was impossible to eat, if I hadn't taken it home I would have had them remake it. My son tried to order a different bread and they told him it was burnt, just wished they had told me the white was over cooked too."}
{"text":"My kids love Subway.  They are young and like the whole kids meal, including the nicer than usual bag it comes in.  One of them always gets a kids meatball sub, which is not officially a kids meal choice, but every other Subway is always happy to accommodate him.  But this is the first store that said that was \"not an option\" and left it at that, she didn't even say anything else.  After a few seconds of dead silence, I told her that he will take a 6\" meatball then.  It's not like I was asking for a premium item, meatball is one if the cheapest things on the menu.  It's even cheaper than some of the other kids options!

When it came around for the second kids meal, I told her just turkey and shredded cheese on the sandwich, nothing else.  She made the sandwich and put a pinch of cheese on it, which didn't even cover half of the meat.  I asked her for more cheese, and she informed me that it would be an additional charge.  I was in a \"whatever\" mood at this point, so I told her to do it.  

When it was time to bag up the order, only one kid was allowed to get the kids bag.  You would think that an upset kid would warrant a second bag, but nope. But at least she forgot to charge me for the extra cheese.

The lack of customer service will keep me from coming back to store."}
{"text":"Rude young male sandwich maker! Never look up and greet anyone!  Just asked what type of sandwich!  Management need to coach this guy about customer service to keep people coming!"}
{"text":"You don't get the quality you pay for. Don't do online orders they put rotten veggies on your sandwhich. They over charge you if you get a sandwhich that already comes with cheese on it  they'll tell you it's gonna cost extra which makes no sense because if you get a steak and cheese sandwhich why should you pay extra if the sandwhich already comes with it the sandwhich is already set at a price higher for that reason. Don't waste your time, go to a different location this one don't value you or your money."}
{"text":"Staff was definitely a cold cut. It seemed as if I was annoying them with my order; from the first person taking my order to the one ringing me out. Don't think I'll be visiting this subway anymore."}
{"text":"Amanda was amazing, CJ was awesome as well. Quality service and excellent employees!!!! Keep up the good work! They kept their smiles while some obviously intoxicated maniac came in and made them feel horrible, before deciding to leave her sandwich and running off to write a bad review. I'm here to say that this subway is amazing and delicious!!! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this subway. It's either one of 2 things when coming to this location.  (1)a poorly made sandwich or (2) the power of a personal cell phone holds priority!  It seems like the owner and a select few employees are more worried about their personal calls. I tried paying one time and the owner had me wait while he answered his phone before cashing me out. I finally told/asked him, what's more important, my money or that call? Cause I'm about to leave with my sandwich. The employees should know that if they need to make personal calls. Try making those calls in between the 2-4pm time frame. I really dislike this franchise! I wish one was closer to my work!"}
{"text":"I have been a Subway customer since they got their start several decades ago in Connecticut.  Over the many years that I have lived in Arizona,  I have been a customer of many, many Subway locations, but this one is my favorite.  A great management team, friendly service, great fresh food in an inviting, clean store provide the elements that make for a  great dining experience day after day.  Way to go Eli and Subway downtown Mesa team!"}
{"text":"I love going to a subway with fast and friendly staff. Most of the time that is the case and I love it, especially when I'm in a rush. I have been to this location a couple times during the day and it's great. When I've gone at night there is this young female worker that just flirts on with the customers. As a customer that is just enjoying a meal I felt extremely uncomfortable eating there. I do not see her working nor helping the other workers. I've also seen her wearing sandals. That shouldn't matter too much but I believe there is a uniform policy everywhere you work. She also laughed at a comment a customer said as she was flirting with them and replied with, \" what are they gonna do? Fire me?!\" She laughed like she can't get fired and owns the place."}
{"text":"I come here during non-busy hours. 

The first time, i went in and there were 2 employees. Both were on their phones. Didnt even know i was there. 

Second time.. i had been waiting at the drive thru for five mins ready to order. A lady walks in and a male worker tells me to \"wait\". 10 mins pass and the lady walks put with her order. Then the worker goes to the back. 

Really? Come on now."}
{"text":"This Subway is horrible!! 

Not only was the food not fresh but the food handling is not sanitary.  I saw the man at the cash register handling cash then make sandwiches.  The cahier would take off one glove but would use both hands when making cash change.  Then I watched him shake the change machine with his gloved hands then go back to making sandwiches. 

When I told the cashier he needs fresh gloves because he touched the money and then the sandwiches he said he didnt to it.  But I saw him do it with alll of the customers before me as well as my sandwich.  I wouldn't buy anything from this Subway."}
{"text":"Just visited this subway and had a complicated order. DARRON was very nice about it and had no problem helping out. He was very helpful and knowledgeable. HIRE more people like DARRON."}
{"text":"Food is good and prepared well, but they inexplicably have 1 person working during the dinner hour on a regular basis. This, inside the Natatorium when tons of hungry folks are finishing their workouts. They also run out of meatballs for subs way too often, and COOKIES!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I ordered a special, they didn't tell me they were out of some ingredients until I asked, charged me almost the full price. I definitely do not recommend and will not come back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I am writing this review months after my encounter here. However, I feel that the woman serving me , who was a good step above the rest in terms of how pleasant and friendly she was, merits this review.

If I recall correctly I ordered a oven roasted chicken on wheat bread loaded with veggies. I've always found this choice to be a tasty and healthy option and I've always enjoyed their sandwiches, this place no different. The lady serving me was according to my best guess was in her late 20s to early 30s. As I mentioned I felt that her warmth and sincerity went well beyond what I've previously encountered. Basically, in addition to getting a good meal at a decent price with timely service in a clean establishment, I encountered an individual where I can say we need more people like her in this world."}
{"text":"I'm not going to write a review of Subway because everyone knows what it is. However, I will comment on two \"features\" of this particular place that help to place this location in the bottom 10% of Subway restaurants in the city. 

1) The consistency in the quality of the sandwiches is terrible. You would think that a business that is centered around an assembly line process would be able to churn out a reasonably similar product every time you order. Nope. Sometimes, I will go and get exactly what I expect. Others times, I will ask for a little bit of mustard and they will empty half the bottle on the sub (yes, I am exaggerating but it's really gross). And sometimes, the ingredients won't fit properly in the bread but instead of re-packing the sub, they will simply close it up hope for the best, notwithstanding the lettuce and chicken overflowing from the sides. It's simply an unacceptable way to do business.

2) The employees are just flat out rude. I understand this place is busy and they try their best to keep the line moving but you cannot speak to people so curtly in the service business. Also, it would be nice for the guy at the cashier to just once hand me back my credit card instead of throwing it across the counter. Finally, thank your customers when you leave. They are the reason you exist.

I go here because it is across the street from where I go to school and the area is sorely lacking in restaurants. Otherwise, I would stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"I went back recently and got the typical Subway service. Disinterested and slow. To be fair, it was definitely not the same guys but the varying quality of service is pretty atrocious."}
{"text":"I like Subway. The food is usually fresh and the staff are polite for the most part. My favorite is the toasted flatbread with chicken breast! The service is a little slower here but it's still good food."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch this afternoon the lady who was making sandwich was very unfriendly. I was eating my sandwich and I can hear her screaming and cursing F**** words behind the counter complaining about some employees. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"This Subway has always had fast service and the employees are pleasant and not stupid like at the Subway across the street, next to Walgreens. They have never screwed up my sandwich and always charged me what they were supposed to, unlike other said Subway."}
{"text":"I went there twice to be sure I didn't get a exceptional situation, but what I'm about to review happened on both time, it can't an accident. 

The worst Subway restaurant I've seen. The employees weren't friendly and more occupied to argue than to serve me. They can't manage to put the deli and veg correctly. How can it be? Are you retarded? No asking if I want the meal with it to if it is to go or here. Actually, I had to complete the transaction myself because after sliding my credit card, the cashier went away to speak with the other employee. So I had to pick my slip and my card. Oh and the place is quite dirty too."}
{"text":"6\" on Italian Herbs & cheese bread, Meatball with double Provolone, toasted and Banana peppers on the side!! 
Can't beat that for $4.15 out the door!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon, and only one employee was working. The line was long, but she kept her attitude up and got through everyone's orders flawlessly. 

Clean restaurant, clean bathrooms, good lacation."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Subway in over a year. A few weeks ago I went to this Subway and the lady making my sandwich was amazing. She made it a point to tell me how much she loved her job and making sandwiches. It was a refreshing experience and lead me to come back the following week. Different employee, but same experience. The gentleman making my sandwich was friendly and interactive. They both made the ordering process, not only fun, but memorable. 

Honestly, the subs tasted like every other Subway I've ever been to but the experience and customer service  at this location is what brought me back and will continue to bring me back. 

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Bought a 6\" Turkey with avocado a couple nights ago and was very disappointed. The meat was plentiful; they threw in 5 slices, which was awesome. However, the entire sandwich was ruined when it came to the avocado. The avocado was past it's due date. It was evidenced by the fact that it was brown and tasted bad. It might have been a one time thing, or maybe the guy didn't notice.

I would give them a second chance, just to see if maybe it improves."}
{"text":"Overall great experience, service was nice, sandwich prepped in good timing. It's actually under new management I guess and it looks like you can tell the difference. It was a lot cleaner than before too. Thank you  to Marcela for being so nice and patient with me because I know I take long to order. Lol"}
{"text":"Agreed.   Those bad reviews are pretty old.   Was there on Friday the 24th and these guys did a great job.   Place was clean and the ingredients were fresh.   Be back soon."}
{"text":"I've been to this spot about a dozen times because of its convenient location, but today will be my LAST TIME. First, our meatball sub was WAY over-toasted. My son chose to not have them remake it since the line was getting long. Then upon arriving at our destination, I found that my foot long Italian Herb bread was WAY undercooked and soggy. Shouldn't they realize the bread is not cooked properly? The employees were unsmiling and did not communicate well with each other either. So basically today was the last straw. We'll be driving a little further to the other Subway because we've given this location multiple opportunities to impress us."}
{"text":"I agree, quite likely the worst Subway on the planet. The employees do not care 1% about you, or your order. I'd rather have a sandwich from the dining hall in all seriousness. Don't waste your time, even if you crave Subway - because this location will make sure you never crave it again."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  I came in around 8 pm tonight (on a Wednesday) because nothing around was open and my girlfriend and I needed to grab a quick bite to eat.  Now keep in mind I understand this is subway, so I do not have very high expectations going in, but this was pathetic.

The shorter, middle-aged to older, woman who helped me was named Sarah, and she informed me she was not the owner. My girlfriend and I  were going to split a footlong and asked if she could toast one side and not the other.  There was no one in the store at the time, and this area is dead at this time of night, so this wasn't a request at another customer's expense.  We were alone in the store!  She refused this request, telling me \"It was one sandwich, she couldn't just toast one side\" knowing she would be cutting the sandwich in half in less than a minute anyways. I informed her of this and she reluctantly cut the sandwich and tossed it in the oven to toast.

My girlfriend finished her sandwich and then it was my turn to select toppings.  I gave her my requests and she proceeded to place (shown in the picture) 2 cucumber slices, 3 jalapenos, 2 banana peppers, and 3 slices of onions.  After the previous interaction with the toasting, I decided that it would be worth the $5 to pay for that sandwich just so I could show everyone how talented this Subway's sandwich artists are."}
{"text":"Never any meat on the sandwich, and the employees overcharge without explanation. Ive been to other subway stores that are not that bad but this one takes the cake. Will not be going back. It's hilarious to watch the employee count the amount of slices of meat they put on your sandwich and if you ask for extra they put two more slices on and charge you two more dollars. RIP OFF!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. The people there are lazy. They forgot my napkins and didn't put cheese on my side when I clearly told them that I needed it. The manager didn't do anything for me I am never coming back there again"}
{"text":"Their veggies are always really fresh. They have a great day crew that always gets my order done fast during the lunch rush. My bread is always fresher and the rest of the subways and they usually make the cookies fresh every day. By far the best Subway in anthem!"}
{"text":"Would give this place zero stars if I could. The cup they gave me to get my soda with had a cockroach in it. Totally disgusted. Never again!"}
{"text":"Service at this store is bad. Frequently, there is just one poorly-trained employee on duty and so the wait is much longer than it should be. Management is totally inept as they are frequently running out of basic stuff like napkins. Avoid."}
{"text":"Subway isn't usually my go to place but this location seems to always have fresh veggies but employees seemed to slack off and not want to be there. I understand work can be a hassle sometimes but if you are getting paid to perform a service, and I, as a customer come in to pay for said service, you would think they would care enough to put some effort in. The food is good. Just the vibe is off. Will check back soon and update if things change"}
{"text":"Cons
Expensive by 33%, untrained& rude workers, and no water cups available. You have to buy water bottle.

Pros
Big dining area.
Slot machines very near."}
{"text":"If you like soft bread don't go to his location, this one is by my house but every time I've gone my sandwich feels like its on a rock versus bread. Not fresh at all"}
{"text":"This location is one star all around. The staff sucks, they are rude (especially night crew) there is a young guy Ethan that works there, don't put it past him to be rude to you every time, he makes it clear he doesn't have any customer service skills nor wants to help you."}
{"text":"I went in on Saturday April 15th with my best friend. I had been there before and always received good service that was until this last time. A women named Tammy was working and she wasn't very friendly from the start. We ordered 2 $6 sandwiches of the day she did make them fine but her attitude was disturbing. She was so unfriendly and it seemed as though something had made her mad prior to our arrival. She wasn't making any eye contact and her tone made it seem as if she was irritated that she had to make our order. It was so uncomfortable that I seriously felt like just walking out I couldn't wait for my order to be finished so I could just leave. I will not be going to this location anymore. Hopefully Tammy is having a better day for the next person."}
{"text":"Meatball w pepperoni!!! Sandwiches are yummy, and the people are nice too. It's nice because it's right next to blockbuster! So u can get ur sandwich and movie and go!"}
{"text":"Ok, here is a true review by a unpaid commentator. Subway should have never allowed their chain to be \"franchised\". This shop at 27th Ave and Thomas is in a tough area and they only have one employee per shift on the weekends. Super slow service by worker with an attitude problem that happens to be friends with the manager who is also cozy with the franchise area manager. Evenings and nights are dangerous in this area unless Phoenix PD is taking their lunch break there at night. Sometimes, there will be 5 to 8 officers on their lunch eating outside on the front patio. Then I feel safe to go in. Otherwise it's hoodrats, tweakers, and employees with attitudes. On a different note, Monday through Friday day shift they will have 2 or 3 staff working and all smiley and courteous because they now corporate managers are roaming."}
{"text":"The girl who made my sandwich on Wednesday was amazing and hilarious! She made my visit enjoyable and i will be back!"}
{"text":"Ryan made me the yummiest sammich I've ever had at a Subway before...I love coming here on my lunchtime!  Anthony & Ryan are seriously the best! I keep coming back because of their outstanding customer service and they way they throw down on custom made sandwiches...delicious!"}
{"text":"CLOSED?! Went by for this morning's healthy breakfast sammich and Regina and crew were gone, and the door said \"This location is no longer open\". 
The crew here made me smile, were always professional and friendly, and worked very hard to keep the place clean. This is depressing."}
{"text":"Just had a Chef Boyardee grade school meatball sandwich.
I never had one from Subway before.
It was the sandwich of the day.
SAD SAD SAD.
Truly the rock bottom of meatball sandwiches.
Now I remember again why I haven't eaten at Subway in over a decade."}
{"text":"Best service at a local Subway. The other stores are not nearly as knowledgeable about the product, pricing, or options as this one."}
{"text":"Bread is extra stale I don't understand
How u didn't feel that service medicre I won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"I was just in there for lunch and there was a woman sitting at a table smoking her vapor cigarette in the restraunt! I was so bothered by that! First of all, I don't want to breath in her toxins of choice! Next off, to be smoking in a restraunt that is smoke free, around all the open food is so gross. I told the woman working and she didn't say anything to the woman. GROSS."}
{"text":"when it first opened it was great...larger portions and friendlier staff...well, now when you walk in you are in a cattle line, and the employee makes you feel like you are making way too much work for them.... the meat is no way fresh and you get a sort of microwaved taste... the veges look like they were dumped in there spots and looked withered.. and the prices just climb higher and higer....well, they cornered the market here at one time...THE STEELYARD COMMONS opened, just down valley then turn right.... and a JIMMY JOHNS is there for you..never had a microwaved, withered veges taste...plus they deliver...motto is .. : \"freaky fast service\" I think before I am half way hanging the phone up..they are here!! nice delivery people also at jimmy johns!...stay away from snubway..lol"}
{"text":"This place continues to dissapoint me. Cant even order online and pickup without them messing it up. 
Whoever owns this place is proof that its hilariously easy to make money in america. If this owner can keep this embarassing subway open, anyone can succeed."}
{"text":"There is definitely a disparity between the commercials and what I received, but it was delicious. I arrived an hour or so before they closed and the bread was soft, veggies fresh and the service friendly."}
{"text":"I love this Subway! The bread and veggies are always fresh. Customer service is great, and it's always nice chit chatting with the manager Jonathan. This store is ran really well."}
{"text":"This place is Fasho subpar. Every time I come here they mess up my sub, like how are you messing up as I'm telling you a step by step order. Then try to charge me for \"extras\" man it come on the sub. Just look at the menu. 
Today the Lil short dude with orange hair was messing it up then the taller dude finished and messed up and tried to charge me wrong. Why is there two people that don't know how subway work even on the schedule at the same time. Also these tables are dirty as hell and it's 630pm on a Wednesday so being busy isn't an excuse since there's nobody else in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, today was the last day for the $2 6\" subs. We bought 4 6\" for less than $11 -- not bad. I don't really like subway but this was an exception. I wish they had more choices especially for veggies. There was a new girl there so the line was kind of held up but that's okay. The cashier guy was kind of funny; gave me a chuckle on the way he was responding to his manager."}
{"text":"Subway is...okay.  I'm giving it 3 stars not because the food is bad (well some of it is, using the microwave to make a sammich? Marone!) but because it's just not knock your socks off good. If I'm going to spend my lazily earned money on food, I want something that I can't make at home, and besides,  there are so many better options out there (Jimmy Johns, Jason's).  

I have to say when I'm on the UNLV campus and I walk by the outdoor Subway (not the one in the Student Union) and smell that bread, it makes me want to walk in.  But I can make a turkey sammich at home for free. Plus I'm not eatin anywhere that uses a speedo clad man as a spokesperson. 

But in a pinch, Subway delivers a consistent, good, middle of the road sammich."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if one Subway experience is ever drastically different from the next, but this one was average.  

First of all, I went at noon on a week day, and it's near Cotton Center, so that's my bad.  The \"room\" is very small, and the few tables they were able to squeeze in felt like they were literally in the assembly line or the doorway.  Fill that space up with about a dozen hungry business people in a hurry, and it gets even smaller.  

That said, the employees were keeping up quite well.  The team was a well-oiled machine and we got through the line pretty quick.  The friendliness of said team varied from person to person.  My sandwich was exactly what I expected, since I ordered the same thing I always do.  

If I go back, I'll go off the lunch hour.  More likely, I'll drive an extra couple miles to the location on 24th St. and Baseline."}
{"text":"Been here many times... Always see the same people.  The food is Subway and wherever you get Subway its about the same.  Service is why not a better review.  YOU are paid $10/hr. to make sandwiches.  Make them with some energy, don't seem so upset that you have to do what you are being paid to do.  Then there is the always cranky kid.. I think his name is Reilly.  Your are really doing him a disservice by ordering a sub from him.  I mean how dare you go to his place of work and make him work.. LOL"}
{"text":"Nestled in a little cranny of duquesne university, this little Subway is here to provide food to hungry college students. It is a Subway, though, so we're not talking gourmet. Normally, a conventional subway experience would garner three stars, but this one failed me on this visit in three capacities: 1) a broken oven, so no toasted sub and 2) no provolone cheese. These are only mild irritants, to be sure, but the third I found somewhat irksome. The sandwich seemed very light on the meat. Makes me think the restaurant is skimping to save, but I could be wrong. That said, the dining area is clean and well maintained, and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"I felt sorry I stopped at this place. The staff was offending and trying to make me regret it."}
{"text":"Negative Infinity and beyond.   Worst restaurant in 30 years,   I have seen cleaner rest stop bathrooms.   The stentch of piss and excrement hits you at 20 feet.  Think it might be from other dissatified customers after my visit yesterday.   At 7 PM they had no bread but Italian, they said it would be ready in 20, closed my windows and went to get gas, do my taxes, and clean my car.  15 minutes later they said another 10 minutes, waited in the parking lot for 10 minutes and another car pulled in front of me.  Theymust get called when they have bread I thought...good.   Got a new phone, programmed it after 30 minutes and the car was still at the window,  it had no license plates and when I honked it tried to back into me, I did't move.  In matter of fact I called the police.  When they finally got there order and I went inside to ask them to report the car without a license plate as is required by law the person there (Kobe) said ok but later said he did not do it.   Anyway they ordered over 20 subs and instead of pulling up so I could get the 1 sub I ordered over an hour ago they would not move.   Actually glad did I not get food from this place, these inept Troglodytes are probably coming in your sandwich, they are mentally challenged and they are not winning that fight.   Horrible place, smell, area, ownership and service.     Can not say anything about the food as I never received any or even an apology.  Would not go back there for free subs for life, its disgusting."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, and they know how to make the sandwiches pretty well. I have never actually had a bad experience at this subway and when they are busy their not too slow."}
{"text":"I went to the above subway at around 2PM to pick up a sandwich. I regret every minute of what happened. I asked them to fill more vegetables and black olives. A guy standing next to me told me that it is enough vegetables for one person and i should not be asking more. I was shocked and said i am not talking to you and i requested the girl (name: Ranjitha) that i want the sandwich the way i want it. The guy next to me got miffed at my ignoring him and started abusing before the crowd. He told me he is the owner. He has every right to do anything to the sandwich. He held my sandwich back and threatened me never to come near his store.

I felt embarrased for the crime of asking to put more black olives. Most of the subway stores in canada are owned by south asian community and i have heard from friends that black olives is one of the items that cost them more. So most of the owners cheap out if you ask for black olives. My request is take another dollar ot so and treat your customers with dignity and respect that any humanbeing deserves.

I am not racial in anyway as i am also a south asian."}
{"text":"Staff was disorganized, line formed before anyone cane from back to greet us. Tried to give me frozen flat bread. Tomatoes were green and sandwich didn't taste very good. I go to subway a whole lot at home (I'm traveling) so this was extremely surprising. Been to many subways in Phoenix too that were great. I'm wondering (hoping) if it would be different if the manager was there. Girls were friendly but food was not good. The cookie was good tho. Ended up tossing the sandwich after about 5 bites."}
{"text":"I'm still annoyed with whoever the incompetent idiots were who were working that day. To think I actually tipped you many times is embarrassing. Pathetic"}
{"text":"My husband sometimes brings home lunch from this location, and we both agree that they are always made super well! You can tell the workers here put the effort in to make good sandwiches"}
{"text":"Awesome Subway location. Large, clean and well staffed.

I consistently choose this location over several others in the Fort Mill/Tega Cay area."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Unfriendly..... Worst subway in the East Valley...skips on ingredients. ...I highly DON RECCOMEND....PLEASE USE ANOTHER SUBWAY....."}
{"text":"Pourquoi arrêter ici? C'est une bonne question parce que comme le client précédent les petits paniers, c'est pas l'invention du siècle pour garder les tables propres. Et oui les tables sont sales. Les services n'est pas vraiment courtois non plus. Pourquoi pas aller au Carrefour Angrignon si vous voulez vraiment du Subway."}
{"text":"The cashier was rude and wasnt at all professional or friendly. He wouldnt even look at me while taking my order. TERRIBLE service. terrible management. couldn't be anymore dissatisfied.
I definitely won't be going to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Asked for some hot sauce on my sandwich and got a swimming pool instead. On top of that the guy was being rude and disrespectful and giving me attitude for no reason at all. Worst service EVER. I had to leave the store, couldn't purchase the sloppy joe the guy prepared"}
{"text":"Cruised in here about 20 minutes ago after a great evening. 

Wow. Worst attitude I've ever experienced from an employee at Subway. No greeting, no interest, no eye contact, body language sending clear signals that my very presence was a major inconvenience. My \"pleases\" and \"thank yous\" never garnered a \"you're welcome. \"

2 customer's came in when I was leaving. They said \"good morning! How are you doing ! \" to same employee only to be met with silence. 

Kind of surprised consider how everyone at jersey mikes and urban turban were so nice and had outstanding food. 

Oh well"}
{"text":"Have gone here twice during their posted hours and they have been closed. You should be busy since you are right next to a hotel."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO THERE ! Worst experience ever, Geeta - the person who served me was completely useless and unprofessional. We all (we were 5-6 customers) waited 20 minutes for a simple transaction to finally end up empty handed... She concluded that the machine only accept cash and took away our orders.... This is unbelievable. I am never going back there and you should stay away from that place."}
{"text":"I go here once in a while because I live close by, and as a chain, the food is predictable.  That said, I will generally not go to this location unless I am pressed for time.  The location is typically not very clean, and the service is always incredibly slow as compared to other locations."}
{"text":"Baked fresh daily? As if. Dry crumbly bread and this is the third time we gave them a chance cuz it's close to home. Not only that, but it's baked too long and overly browned. Service has been hit or miss. Sometimes friendly sometimes seems like they wish you wouldn't have showed up. Meh"}
{"text":"I walked in to subway this evening to order dinner for myself and family. I noticed that a staff member was wearing a gun in plan site. I asked why he had to wear a firearm while working. He said that they've been robbed in the past. Doesn't make it right...... it's insane to have a team member carry a weapon.  He was way to young to carry a weapon. It would be easier and safer to hire security in the evening's. I don't need a shot out while ordering a sandwich. I won't be returning there, that's for sure"}
{"text":"Super service. Friendly and attentive staff and welcoming. Very clean. Fresh veggies. Great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!!

The guy that made my sub looked really unhappy and annoyed. He disgustingly threw the meat and cheese to the side after putting some on the sub. In the meantime the cashier lady got in an argument with a customer. Instead of backing off when the customer started walking away she decided to talk back with attitude. The customer then got ticked off and started arguing again! Then!! The cashier lady walked from behind the counter to the customer area and pointed to the arguing customer and said 'let's take this outside'. I could not believe this was happening. Needless to say, their staff is very unhappy and don't understand the concept of 'service industry'. I will never go back. No thanks!"}
{"text":"The place was dirty and the guy making the sandwiches didn't change his gloves, when touching pork then turkey."}
{"text":"The employees here never smile. Maybe they are all having a bad day but jeez where is the friendly customer service?"}
{"text":"Usually pretty good here minus the wait. Today, no wait but she made me a COLD oven grilled chicken sandwich. The veggies were sparse and looked sad. And my favorite part - my third bite in had something so hard in it that I hurt my tooth. Upon spitting it out I still don't know what it was, two little back/brown rock hard \"things\". Can you say GROSS!!!"}
{"text":"This subway is near my college, so a lot of the students will come here for lunch. Expect long lines during 11-12:30. Ingredients taste fresh, and they have a large selection of breads. The sandwich artists will try to charge you extra for cheese if you order the steak and cheese, so watch him as he process your order. The cookies are always fresh. There is limited seating, so if you come during lunch hours on a weekday, don't expect to get a seat. There is outdoor seating, but most of the time there are no chairs, or the students will bring them inside."}
{"text":"So 5th time here and it's always something, long line, no one behind the back counter, out of the bread I want, and now no meatballs. How do you not have meatballs? It's the only somewhat healthy option in this area so I'm forced to come back but, I think not anymore."}
{"text":"Italian herbs and cheese with spicy Italian , cheese and toasted. All veggies included with southwest , honey mustard and sweet onion was the best thing I had from there ."}
{"text":"Subway is a fast food chain so can't expect amazingness but you can expect to get what you order. I had a terrible experience at this location about a year ago and every time I went back I dreaded it. The girl was so rude and throwing my sandwich around like nothing. She must have been having a bad day so I let it slide even tho I wanted to leave! I kept coming back and that same girl was always there however she has always been super nice to me since then. I never complained to anyone about her or anything I think she just realized that I'm a regular. Always be the nicer kinder person in every situation because sometimes things aren't meant towards you it's just a bad day.. I understand but I still feel like she was way out of line. However this subway is my go to it's closest to me. I always get the same thing and it's always great!"}
{"text":"Pressed bread, bad cutting, place all in the middle, bad wrapping. Inconsistent in general."}
{"text":"My sandwich was okay, my issue was with the staff, in particular Reilly and another young girl. First of all, he seemed pissed at the world to be at work and put off that I ordered a sandwich. I almost walked out when ordering because the two workers at the counter got into a fight and slammed the customers sandwich down on the counter in front of me. They were arguing about who was doing all the work, what time they were supposed to leave, and what the workers in the back were (or weren't) doing. I was shocked that they were arguing like this in front of customers and never once apologized or seemed embarrassed of their behaviors.  I'm pretty sure the store owner has no idea these behaviors are being exhibited by the employees."}
{"text":"I went a few minutes before lunch time the other day.  Their were only 2 employees, and were very under staffed. About 7 different customers walked in at once, and the 2 employees started filling up all of the veggies / meats / cheeses that they didn't have a good supply of.  I would have thought they would have done that a litter earlier, instead of when 7 people walked in.  I was second in line and it took awhile for the two people in front of me to tell the employees their order, and then pay for the order. I noticed that the lettuce didn't look fresh on my sandwich and that it was browning in quite a few spots.  

This Subway is not up to par with the other Subway stores I have been to."}
{"text":"It's Saturday morning and my friend and I are working overtime. We took a quick break to walk to subway/winchells for coffee and donuts.
When my friend went to get creamer for her coffee, the clerk yanked the basket away and said, No more!! We have to leave some for the rest of our customers\".  My friend bought a large coffee and wanted 6 creamers...that bitch had the audacity to refuse her condiments after we had each just spent over $5 each on their products!!!
Pay attention Winchells!!!  We work in a BIG BUSY office and will be spreading the word that your employees treat customers like shit!!!
We will not be spending any more of our hard earned money in ANY of your locations ever again!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced!!!  I don't know why I should have to pay over $10+ for a sub just because it is a hole in the wall in a hotel."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst experience ever. Ordered online for 1:05. Got there at 1:10 and they have my order ready, didn't even know what my order was. Gave her the description, the young lady had me sit down and wait then surprises me with \"we don't have tuna\" so I say \"okay I'll settle for a chicken sandwich. She adds all the toppings from the previous order that I clearly said I did not want on this new order. She pretty much half assed everything. Toasted my sandwich for 5 Lucky I had to get back to work, I would have made a friendly phone call while i was there. Terrible service- get it TOGETHER!




12/12/17 : 1:12 pm- same girl Maria- just dropped my coworkers sandwich! Needs to make new one. Lmao!! This is crazy... she isn't fit to work there Im sorry."}
{"text":"Subway no matter what the location is dog food on bread.  HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 ft long sandwiches this evening for dinner. This location is 5 mins from my home and it's the second time I've gone to this Subway and let me tell you... all the breads were hard and dry. Had two sandwiches on wheat and one on white and it was wood city. Really sad because it totally destroys the meal. When we went to squeeze down to bite, the bread crackled and crunch. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Worst Subway experience ever.  Bread was stale.  I asked for a cup of water, and was told that I would have to be charged full price for the cup, and they don't even offer water in their soda fountain.  Will not return to this Subway location."}
{"text":"I frequent this subway often and always there out of the green Tee. I asked the manager why they are always out of this Tee they said well the reason we out now is the nozzle is broke which it was and has been broke for a few days. So I asked even before this was Broke you are always out it's obviously the most popular Tee. She replied actually I like the half and half Tee and I said well I don't and I'm the customer she had her head phones on and was sitting in customer area. I proceeded to order anyways. Then I went to ask her how long before the Tee would be fixed. She acted like she didn't here me because her head phones were on and then I said to the other employee there I guess she doesn't want to hear me. Then she replied actually I heard you but I'm on break. So I said you don't take care of a customer because your on break that's not right either. Her attitude sucked and I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Service was good however the chicken sub I ordered was NOT cook all the way. It was barely warm. Definitely not coming back here."}
{"text":"My daughter and I come here weekly before her evening class and I am always happy with the service and quality of food. The location is always clean. The workers are always smiling and greeting customers."}
{"text":"Its subway. Theyre the worlds largest fast food chain. ofcourse its has quality and consistency! Why are you even still reading this post? GO AND VISIT THEM!"}
{"text":"Worst subway I have ever been to... really please strain all the blood off the roast  beef before you put it in my sub.... Oh wait I asked and the girl said \"that is how it comes\"..... really I have never had rare roast beef at any other location and to top it off wrong bread. Same question 3 times and still wrong bread. This place sucks and I'm sorry I stopped in way before closing and the employees were upset with costumes coming in at 8:10 no worries will never go back and since my work is down the street will never recommend since there are 4 other subways in five miles...... so glad you all are private businesses cause however pays these people they should be fired. Really the worst of everything."}
{"text":"Went into this Subway today with my children.  Everything was fine until the attendant behind the counter gave attitude. He was not interested in serving us at all. Will never go back.."}
{"text":"My husband and I just left a baseball game for our kiddos. He dropped me off at subway while he drove to McDonald's to grab the boys happy meals, great idea right? WRONG!!! The two guys working inside locked the door?? I double checked the time.. 9:23 on the dot! Hours say 10 pm. Open sign on, oh wait I left out the best part!!! They were laughing! They watched me walk across the street to McDonald's! I told them I was calling their boss. What brats!"}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews but this guy Steven was pretty awesome!!! He subway was FULL of customers and it seemed like he was solo which sounds weird for a Friday ..... but he was awesome! Super friendly and apologized for the wait once we were up.... anyway!!! He was in good spirits which was great!!"}
{"text":"First off, I'm not dogging on all Subways. Usually they'd rank a 2 to a 3 star from me. 

But this one at 16th & Camelback ranks by far as the worst one I've ever been to. Maybe it was because I came at night, because who eats a sandwich at night? (I do), but it was filthy & depressing, I was standing there waiting while the two guys behind the counter were \"busy\" (I was the only patron in there), and my tuna sub? The nastiest sandwich I've ever eaten, even by Subway standards. You know how you wring a towel to get all the water out? Imagine your stomach doing that. Not a fun night, no. 

Moral of the story is (for me) that I'm never going back to this particular Subway again - I'll stick to Jamba'ing next door instead. Maybe you should, too."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Always great service, very friendly.  It's a little more laid-back compared to other locations; due to it not getting too busy, due to location.  The foods good and the dining room clean.  It's typically slow enough that it's only a one person crew, so be patient."}
{"text":"The best service I've had at a Subway. All the staff is terrific, save one. The atmosphere is extremely inviting as are the staff. I recommend going during the day time, to get the best experience. David's extremely loud greeting lets you know you have been noticed. It may sound militant, but you get used to it, and realize it is truly a warm welcome. Debbie, the manager is nice and personable. A little stressed, but that is expected with the volume of her store. 
  The only reason I am not giving five stars, is one employee. James, is his name and he usually works evenings. He is rude, disrespectful and creepy towards the women, and truly belongs away from a college campus. 
  In closing, aside from the one drawback, I'd have given it a five star rating."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. I went in on my lunch hour and asked for a sandwich. The boy who was helping me kept asking \"what\" everytime I answered his question. I'm not a soft spoken person. When he added my cheese he mistakenly used 3 peices on my 6 inch. However once he noticed,  he throw away the extra cheese slice. My person opinion, if you are goind to throw away food, just keep it on the sandwich. Such a waste. 
The worst part was he started COUGHING while he was making my food! At that point I politely told him I would not take the sandwich and his response was, of course \"what?\" I used to come here for lunch all the time, now I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place has had more leadership changes in the last 4 years than UPitt football. But, doesn't seem to really affect them one way or another. This is a subway, people. You don't come here because you just LOVE their oven roasted chicken. You come here because it is on campus, reasonably priced, and very fast. To that end, they certainly deliver as much as even the best Subways can. They get my approval."}
{"text":"The boys that work here are so rude I will never purchase another item from this shop EVER. While I was inquiring about a price difference compared to the price I usually pay, one of the smart-mouth employees  tell me its because I'm in a casino.   Well i buy the same thing at least a couple times a month from that location and this time the price was higher, wouldn't you inquire??  It doesnt matter what their prices are now. I'll go somewhere else. Too much competition around town to go somewhere they made me angry."}
{"text":"I order through the app. 75% of the time they mess up the order or it is made 10min+ later than the pick up time."}
{"text":"This Subway is inside the Orleans hotel/casino, in the food court area.
I always get a veggie patty sandwich, just like a previous reviewer, and when I went to this Subway on 4/7/12 they also did not have the veggie patty.
Get with it, Subway manager!!!!
Order more damn veggie patties and put them in the freezer!

I also don't understand why they charge extra to put avocado on my completely vegetable-based sandwich. I'm already skipping the meat AND the cheese...don't you think you could throw me a bit of avo? Hrrrrmmmmmph.

Other than that, food was fresh, made quickly. Sufficient to ward off starvation."}
{"text":"Ate here once a week for almost a year.

Until I got food poisoning =(

I suppose it's the risk you take eating fast food, but I still won't be back.

2 stars because as much as I eat there it was bound to happen eventually."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and eat at many different Subway restaurants. It has usually been pretty good. Clean washrooms and decent sandwiches. Subway has a Deal on now, $3 for a six inch turkey breast sub. Sounds good, give it a try. But not at this location. They lady asked if I wanted cheese on it for 60 cents extra. Figuring she was trying to scam me I said no. A few days later I ordered the same $3 sub at a different location and to my surprise there was no mention of extra charge for cheese.  I contacted Subway head office for an explanation over 2 weeks ago. No response. Do they think complaints can be ignored?  NO SOUP FOR YOU"}
{"text":"Now, this is way out of the box for me generally speaking, since i am not a fan at all of eating anything that comes out of a gas station. But i have to say i was mildly satisfied with the level of service received, and the food quality was actually on par and even slightly above my typical expectations of subway. The foot long i ordered was fresh, the toppings did not look like they were really fresh, but unlike some other sub places i have dined at, these didn't look 2 weeks old either. I recommend this subway over the other one on ridge and pearl or worst yet, the one located inside Walmart on west ridge-wood drive."}
{"text":"Brutal. Showed up and they are packed up a half hour before they close. Have no buns and guy is closing. Only flatbreads he says??? Live in the hood but won't go again. New guy is bad. Where did our regular guy go? Was always ready til he closed."}
{"text":"I mean it is Subway so you know what you are getting, but this location is open 24 hours so that is a bonus. I have had mixed service with some great service here on several occasions but saw some employee verbal fighting once."}
{"text":"Food is like any other subway. I frequent this location almost twice a week. However, the owner is always extremely rude so I will be taking my business to the subway on 35th Ave.

Tried it today once more and walked right out. Not sure what's up with the owners bad attitude."}
{"text":"Don't know why it's such negative reviews on this location but I love them! Every single time I've been there I've been welcomed in and some of the employees remember my sandwich (as I get the same thing every single time LOL) but they are all so nice and I get the vibe they all want to be there."}
{"text":"Just went to this Subway and it was by far the cleanest Subway shop.  I was not overwhelmed with the smell of freshly baked bread but it was very pleasant.  The lady that was working was very nice too."}
{"text":"This is only based when comparing this Subway location to others. The Parkdale subway is pretty fine. The franchise opts to include green olives, which isn't required like its cousin the black olive. Also, points for how they deal with the neighbourhood characters, who may not want to buy a sandwich.

Better cookies that Quiznos, we had a taste-off I guess.

Parkdale subway, you okay."}
{"text":"I come here most days because I work across the street! Everyone is super nice and speedy. Shoutout to Heather for being SO friendly and keeping her calm and professional demeanor when there are rude customers. One of my favorite Subways!"}
{"text":"They had fresh food! And is the best Subway I have been to so far!!

Was right next to my college too, so was very convenient."}
{"text":"Second time coming in to this location in two days. First time we ordered through the app. Walked in and waited ten minutes past our pick up time. The lady told us, there was people that walked in the store to whom come first than the people who order through the app... eh, wrong answer! This time, same ordeal, order isn't ready yet. Told us to pick it up at 9:47pm. It is now 10:02  and the lady still hasn't made our flipped food. I'll never come here again. Worst costumer servicer ever. They don't even apologize for the inconvenience!!!"}
{"text":"Manager was rude and vegetables were no longer fresh.  We will never return to this location."}
{"text":"This Subway is highly overpriced. I know it's located on the strip so they have to cover rent by charging higher prices but $9 for a footlong Cold Cut Trio sandwich is ridiculous. But, again I understand. The 1 star is because I walked all the way to Subway for the sandwich and the bread was stale. Like not day old stale but just stale. I was so upset. I called the store and no one answered so I had to walk all the way back to the store. I got a refund and went my way. Subway is known for baking their bread in house and their slogan is \"Eat Fresh\" for goodness sakes. When the bread is old. THROW it AWAY!!! Unacceptable!! And to top it all off, the people that work there were slow and not friendly at all."}
{"text":"Sandwiches always are good but EVERY TIME I have been here it's been different employees and they ALL seem bored and lack customers service and enthusiasm. I always come for dinner and only one person is working unless someone is in the back that I can't see. Teach your employees to smile and speak louder"}
{"text":"Cam and Toby are awesome Toby is amazing! Got three foot longs one he started making and we changed our minds and he was so down to start the sandwich over such a sweetheart !"}
{"text":"Took them 15 mins to ring up order , rude , no respect towards customer. Guy had attitude with people because there machine was down ."}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday afternoon and ordered a chicken salad and when I arrived to the hotel and try to ate my salad the chicken was soooo fake! GRILLED CHICKEN IS COMPLETELLY FAKE!!! Is like bread in the oven with some bubble gum. I would never again use this place as restaurants is disrespectful and unhealthy sale this product and should be illegal!!! -1 star!!! :'("}
{"text":"The two girls working clearly hate their job and people. Not only were they completely rude and put out but the place was a mess and the ingredients all looked unkempt and not very appetizing. Whoever owns this store... I STRONGLY suggest getting rid of the two girls who were working tonight. I will not be back to this location and I can almost guarantee the other two customers in there at the same as me won't be back either."}
{"text":"Cleanest Subway I have ever been to.  Great staff too. 

Sandwich was well made and had plenty of fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I know!  Why am I reviewing a chain sandwich shop... it's not that I'm reviewing this specific location, I'm here to expound the delight of the Veggie Max!

I've always ordered the Italian BMT but loaded w/ tons of veggies.. but an Indian veg friend clued me in to the Veggie Max (not the regular.. MAX).  Comes with veggie patties, which mentally and seems to be physically filling as well...   

tip:  This sandwich isn't meant for saving and eating later... few hours later, my cold veg patty is as hard as a rock... not sure if I should wonder why..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Subway. The difference is the people. The manager and staff do a great job. They are warm and very efficient in making your sandwich. Food safety protocols are followed and the store is always very clean."}
{"text":"Despite it being a chain, I'm such a fan of Subway -- and even moreso now that I live on the 'true to tv advertised prices' mainland. While I was living in Hawaii, I would often get frustrated at the $5 footlongs advertised with the \"not available in Hawaii\" exclusion on the bottom of the screen. But there's no such problem here! This location is convenient to me and has friendly workers, with the usual great selection of fresh sandwich fixins. After 5pm most footlong subs are $5 if you buy two, which makes a great, reasonably priced dinner for two after a long day. I typically get the chicken bacon ranch, sans ranch plus southwest sauce -- it's SO good! Plus, there are often coupons in those weekly circulars that arrive in the mailbox - so it's possible to get yourself an even better deal if you take a few extra minutes. Eat fresh!"}
{"text":"Only reason I give this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because its a drivethru!!!! I've been saying for years how awesome it would be to have a drivethru subway. But this place had like 4 tiny tiny tables to sit at inside, the lady who helped us had a crazy attitude AND they didn't have the veggie patty!!! What?!? That's the only thing I get at subway! So I ended up just not eating. Dumb!"}
{"text":"Aaaah WOW these employees need major customer service training.. No return visit for this Team.. Smile your on camera signage inside, OWNER needs to review video.. or the OWNER needs to FIRED for not caring. Meatball sub was the worst I ever had at any SUBWAY..   WALMART and SMITH'S have bigger and better subs what is that saying about this subway location... OUCH!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Subway after a workout.  Most of the staff is always very nice.  There is one staff member that is extremely pleasant and remembers my order.  I have some \"creature of habit\" tendancies and love to have my meals prepared the same.  Including my quick stops for a turkey on wheat with fixings from Subway.  The food is always fresh....even if I go late in the evening.  Thank you Subway for being convenient!  And special thanks to the outstanding staff!!"}
{"text":"My sub was 3 inches long and not 6. The two girls making the subs were very nice but the girl at the register would not even smile and looked miserable.  This subway sucks in general."}
{"text":"I usually go to a subway by my house but since I was in the area I stopped by this one for lunch and  4 hours later I started feeling so sick and my stomach was rumbling and burning and I ended up throwing all of it up. I got my usual blt so I don't know what's going on but I'm sticking to the one by my house if and when I decide to eat subway again"}
{"text":"This was a pretty mediocre Subway. The workers were okay, but not particularly friendly or good at making sandwiches. 

They were very skimpy on toppings (veggies and sauces) and my sandwich was pretty bland. Bread didn't seem all that fresh. 

The parking lot is fairly small and tight so not the best at trying to get in and out when it's busy."}
{"text":"Really weird location in a tiny mostly defunct strip mall on Westinghouse but that's good for me.  Can get busy right around 12:30 but not a soul before noon.  Standard subway offerings which I happen to think are awesome. My only issue is the lady that always does the toppings, she can never hear what you are asking. I'm not sure what that's all about but twice she's messed up my order. So getting oil isn't going to kill me but it's really messy on the run. Otherwise a clean little subway with decent food."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard food court Subway with supra-standard prices. I guess that's what one should expect here on the strip. Certainly one can get a footlong sub for 1/3-1/4 the price of a buffet - but do you really come all the way to Vegas just to end up eating at subway?!

Well, if you're on a budget and looking for a healthier option than Sbarro, Panda Express, Johnny Rocket's, or if you're actually tired of gorging yourself at the Bellagio buffet - or if you're like me and all of the above apply, then yes. Subway it is."}
{"text":"Went in to with the family to grab some subs as we were getting home late from graduation ceremonies. I've been in this particular store a few times in the past, and my experience has not changed. Let me tell you this store is quite ghetto with some of the staff they employ. Let me explain: The first few times I've encountered staff hanging out with their friends at one of the tables. The store was empty, however. As I was waiting to have my sub made I waited quite awhile until the employees had to pry themselves away from their friends. The staff seemed bothered but I made it out of there with my sub in hand. Bring this most recent experience to light now. As I mentioned we were coming in after graduation ceremonies so they were a bit busy. The spouse ordered first. The young dude making the sub gave attitude after he misheard the spouses order. After some unintelligible comments under his breath he proceeded to scrape the tuna off the bread and attempted to use the same bread for the correct order ham/turkey. The spouse ensured he used fresh unused bread. The young kid stated \"oh, you're one of those types of customers\". I bit my tongue and let it go. I probably would've ended up in jail had I let that comment get the best of me. In conclusion, we will NEVER step foot in that particular store again. It appears they employ unsupervised malcontents who have zero customer service. I feel bad for the owner because I'm sure the owner only wants to make a good living but it has yahoos who is driving customers from that store."}
{"text":"This place was gross. The smell in the air was of wet dog and puke. I didn't even want to eat here but my best friend John Tip was starving. He paid for my meal but I was sick with worry. I would never eat here again. The service was poor and the food looked old and dry. The bread was stale. There is no Key."}
{"text":"If you like meatball subs, don't go here. They never seem to have meatballs (or the employees aren't willing to make them.) The past several times I've been in here, usually around 7 pm-9 pm, I've waited several minutes in line (no biggie) just to walk out because they don't have meatballs."}
{"text":"I have never had an experience at a restaurant (or quick-service spot) that has sparked me to do anything but just not come back. I'm the diner who is unhappy, will tip 20%, not complain, but never, EVER return. My experience at this Subway today made me feel burning levels of service industry betrayal that I've haven't felt in years. I've bussed, served, bartended and managed for the past 15 years of my life. My livelihood is contingent on my success in this industry. When I encounter bad eggs, I feel as if they are a poor representation for all of us. 

I entered this Subway a couple weeks ago on a Tuesday for a mid-morning turkey sub. There were two ladies from a cleaning company standing in front of the register looking dumbfounded. They had been there for ten minutes with no one manning the front of the store. There was a \"ring for service\" bell that we hit twice. Then waited five minutes. Hit it again. Nothing. We looked at each other; we could take anything we wanted from this store if we wanted (but didn't, obviously - we were women of principle..). FINALLY after ten minutes, a lady emerged from the back, and said, \"stop ringing the f%cking bell. I'm on the phone with my godda$&@ manager. You can wait!\" She snatched the bell away, and disappeared again. We all looked at each other and laughed, nervously. It was so absurd and offensive that it was hard to believe that this was a real-life occurrence. Out of sick fascination, I waited to see how this would unfold. She disappeared for ANOTHER five minutes, then came out, gave an exasperated sigh and said, \"what do you want?\" I turned around, and left, before I acted out of character and actually said anything about my dissatisfaction. Obviously, I'm still reeling from the experience."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this location as it is five minutes from my work, but sadly, Subway became complacent, lazy, putting too many items on their menu, while using cheap cold-cuts and increasing prices across the board.  I remember when Subway was the new kid on the block, and a much needed option on the fast food landscape other than microwaved burgers, salty fries, and processed so- called chicken nuggets.  But a few years ago, they were left behind as other sandwich shops like DiBella's, Penn Station, and Jersey Mike's came on the seen with better products and better quality, leaving Subway in the dust.  So long Subway, it was nice knowing you."}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service. Every time we go to this location it's just terrible. The worst attitudes from these teenager employees. Sorry we didn't really know the difference between certain sandwiches. To see the way these kids have customer service is very embarrassing for our future. Myself and my husband are both in customer service. Please stop hiring teenagers who hate their jobs and Who can't interact with other people."}
{"text":"They are always super friendly and helpful. I  always enjoy it.  The food is fresh and tasty. I love the new salad for the price of a sub."}
{"text":"This is the worst subway I have ever been to the employees have no personality and could care less what your sandwich look like when they're done with it I will never go back to this establishment again as I hope the owners continue to read these reviews because it looks like everyone is unhappy with the store by far the worst sandwich I've ever had I contemplated taking it backbut it's not worth my time to deal with that 17-year-old kid that acted like his time was more important than mine"}
{"text":"Not the best Subway around. I will almost always make a trip to a different location. They seem to skimp on ingredients and give extra on the attitude. Last trip I went on as it was closest to home and watched some soccer Mom loose it after being treated very poorly. She was right but in the end they still got her money :("}
{"text":"One of the worst Subways I've ever been to. Note to everyone considering a franchise: if you can't afford to run the business correctly, DON'T DO IT! 

Although there were three annoying things that  happened at this Subway, I wasn't going to make a public complaint until I opened the sandwich at home.

1. I was about to get the last bit of tuna in the tub, so I asked if there was a fresh one. The guy says \"It's from today.\" This was now 4:30 pm. But, he did replace. 

2. I asked for swiss cheese. \"I don't have that today.\" 

3. I asked for cup to get water. \"I don't have water. The machine is broken.\"

I bought the sandwich. When I got home and took sandwich out of the bag, it felt wrong. See photo. Yep, the supposed 6 inch sandwich was just 5 inches!"}
{"text":"Of the numerous Subways around U of T campus, this is by far the worst. Every single time I have ever went there, I have been dissatisfied. Either the employees were rude, the dining area was disgusting, or, worst of all, the staff couldn't make my order right. Before going to this specific subway, I didn't know it was possible to mess up a simple turkey sub, but thanks to the staff there (or one specific lady who always seems to be working), I now realize it requires some level of skill. 
Here's a specific little story: I ordered my usual 6-inch turkey breast on italian bread. Toasted of course. I wasn't paying attention as the lady put ham on my sandwich and preceded to toast it. After it came out of the oven, I realized it was ham and pointed this out, since I cannot eat ham. She told me I had ordered this (really? I don't think I would make that mistake, since I ALWAYS order the same thing and cannot eat ham...), and asked if I was SURE I didn't want it. I said no, and so she preceded to throw away the ham and put my turkey breast on the already baked bread, and stuck if back in the toaster.
Not at all thrilled with a twice toasted sub that was so hard I could barely bite into it, with remnants of ham juice all over it, I ended up starving through my subsequent lecture.
And unfortunately, this is just one of many similar anecdotes about this little restaurant. Go to the one on college, another block of walking isn't too bad."}
{"text":"The Good,  the Bad and the Ugly

The Good: Ingredients are always fresh. Bread is usually fresh too. Restaurant is kept clean. 

The Bad: Always understaffed, so if there is more than one customer at a time...well, I hope you packed a lunch. Also, they don't participate in any of the standard Subway deals. It actually costs more to have a sandwich here than at a location in Toronto. 

The Ugly: Holy stingy, Batman! I have to fight for just a standard amount of toppings. They actually remove ingredients from your sandwich if they feel they accidentally gave you too much! What?? Yeah. That is tight my friends. 

I love Subway as a healthier alternative but this location makes very light sandwiches. I suggest walking over to Longos next door and grab the ingredients to make your own hero sandwich. You deserve better."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service! Help caughs on sandwich, and the help is filthy dirty! The employees are very rude and act as though customers are there to serve the employees lol! The owner actually refused service to someone because someone asked the employee to have their ingredients placed inside of the sandwich instead of outside and all over outside the sandwich. The owner actually refused service to the customer because the employee didn't like the customer's request to keep the ingredients inside the sandwich!"}
{"text":"Went to get some subs and they were out of bread... Really you are a sandwich shop right? When it looks like your running low on bread make some more"}
{"text":"Kattie Petty, general manager at Subway McDowell location, the sole reason I still have hope for society. Between the warm greeting to the uplifting goodbye and everything in between Kattie made the whole experience a Disney perfect experience. The only downside to this experience is the 50 min drive I now have to accomplish every time I want subway because I refuse to accept food from anyone but Kattie Petty. This girl is going places. 

#shredthegnar"}
{"text":"This subway is under new ownership. Unfortunately the staff just suck at their jobs. They were trying to talk with each other the entire time I was ordering my sandwich. The woman was barely paying any attention and when I asked her to put easy onions she put double the normal amount. I had to pick them off when I got back to the office. When she putting the other veggies on she just threw them on and made a big mess of it all. The gentleman that finally came from the back at the register ignored me while I was waiting for him to ring me up. I had to look at the woman and she told him my order. Both were still trying to talk with another employee trying to leave. 

The parking also is terrible. It's a one way parking because of the small size. I park behind the building in the hotel lot when I can.

I won't be returning to this location under this management. It use to be a much more customer oriented place."}
{"text":"I really like Subway. I don't eat Subway every day but when I do, I try to go to the one down the street - this one is awesome, thanks!"}
{"text":"I probably know every Subway in a 20 mile radius of my home,and this is the best one Ive seen in Phoenix.And I should know:I make a special trip to eat at this one at least five days a week.Why?The meats,cheeses,and salad items are always fresh and appetizing.They always have the bread I want,even at 8:00 at night.I cant even think of another Subway in Phoenix I could say that about.The bottled drinks are always cold,and the chips are always stocked.
           But the real attraction is the quick,friendly,efficient service I get from the wonderful staff.They never fail to leave me satisfied,and with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"I would never think of giving this five star let alone two. This place gets one star because went to the store a half hour before it closes, and the guy behind the counter is putting everything away for the night. I have been to this place late at night every time it's like that you can't get what you want because it's all ready put away. This wasn't just one time. I am done going to this place."}
{"text":"the one star is purely for the customer service. The girl making my sandwich tore my bread by accident and when I asked her if she would kindly replace it instead of continuing to make my sandwich, she got the BIGGEST ATTITUDE ever. You would have thought I asked her to cook me a 5 course meal lol She threw the bread on the ground and didn't even answer me, proceeded to grab a new piece of bread and made my sandwich. Maybe she was having a bad day, and I was the straw that broke this camels back. lol anyways, I wont be back. I don't feel like being treated that way. Both girls working were super young and obviously didn't want to be there or talking to people. Management should get on that."}
{"text":"Staff ranges from friendly and competent to rude and inept. Sometimes they pile on the toppings while other times they seem to count each olive slice and onion ring. None of the sandwiches EVER look like those pictured or advertised. You know them, the ones overflowing with meat and cheese and such. No. Instead we get a just enough slices of meat to barely cover the bread and then a few slices of cheese strategically placed short of one layer. I once asked staffer why my sandwich didn't look like the one in the photo next to its name and the person just looked at me like I was crazy. People, we have to demand the product advertised!!!! Unite!!! Express yourselves!! Tell them you want the fillings piled high. Don't settle for less.  Subway is a better choice for a meal than some other fast food places but when I see the great looking sandwiches on TV, I wonder where to get them. Certainly not at this Subway."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! But what makes it exceptional is the friendliness and great. The food is just the icing on the cake! Go subway! Eat fresh!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy lunch spot.  I like going to this location.  Friendly staff and pretty clean.

I'm a fan of the Subway club with tons of veggies."}
{"text":"We stopped going to Subway a year or two ago after repeated horrible experiences. But I'm surprised to say that this was BY FAR the best Subway experience my boyfriend and I have ever had. Jessie (I really hope thats her name), was OUTSTANDING. She was so nice, offered us everything and then some, smiled the whole time, and even thanked us for coming in. It was everything you want a Subway experience to be. GREAT HIRE, SUBWAY!!"}
{"text":"So I came here during my lunch and is usually my spot once or twice a week. I know for a fact that other Subways provide you a receipt that has a survey and if you complete the survey you get a code that will give you a free cookie. This location in particular would avoid giving you a receipt so they can avoid others trying to claim their cookies. I one day went to another location and asked if they have a receipt policy and they said it is a franchise policy that the receipt must be provided or at least offered. So I thought this was a one-off situation and maybe they forgot to give me a receipt so I tried another day and then another day... no luck on the receipt. One day I asked for the receipt and they said they don't give receipts. The only receipt they will give is the debit/credit card receipt which is not the purchase receipt. 

So what did i do? I contacted head office about this in hopes that they will get down to the bottom of this. It's only a cookie.. i get that but it's the rudeness and attempt to con the franchise/customers that gets to me. \"C is for cookie\"... not \"Con\".

Other then this issue, the restaurant is clean, service is quick and seating is comfortable. Plaza location is small and is located in a deserted location. No people = no line. That's how I see it.

One thing i did like about this location is they were the only location that held onto the Creamy Sriracha sauce longer then it needed to. I was disappointed when the other locations took it away."}
{"text":"Food was good, the person behind the counter was very slow. There were only 2 people in line waiting, she seem very nervous."}
{"text":"It's Anthem's and Inspirada's neighborhood subway. The staff are nice and make your sandwiches fast. I have never waited long to have a sandwich made. I've come in at different times of the day and there was never a line. The restaurant is clean and well stocked. I've never had a problem here."}
{"text":"What the...

I was super impressed by this Subway. I tend to reserve four and five stars for places that really exceed my expectations. And fortunately, because I am addicted to Yelp, I find only the best of the best. But what brought my to Subway was the need to feed. On a hot AZ day I was driving around running errands with friends when suddenly I just had to have some lunch. My friend spotted this Subway and while I first thought that finding another option might be better, I didn't see the point in disagreeing. We walked in and were immediately greeted by three smiling employees eager to take our orders. We wanted the same sandwich, split, so they offered to make two sandwiches but give us the low low price of 1 footlong instead of 2 6 inches. This saved us two bucks!

The \"sandwich artists\" were super funny and it was clear that they had been working here a while. They had a good time slapping the ingredients together and really piling on the toppings. I don't live in the area but if I lived closer, I'd come here just for the service. I left here with a smile on my face and a pretty decent sandwich to boot."}
{"text":"Please do not waste your time and go here. Save yourself disappointment and go to the new subway in Walmart on university blvd. They do not accept coupons and the bread is dry. Wish I could give less than one star."}
{"text":"This location is extremely unreliable. Pulled up at 9:30 and they were closed, despite posted hours indicating they were open till 10 pm on fridays. This isn't the first time this has happened either- if you want to get food here, make sure you call and see if they are actually open. 

We've also gone in to eat and been told that they are only accepting cash at the moment. Seems kinda sketchy if you ask me."}
{"text":"This location is okay. Not as busy and they don't have the 9 grain honey oat bread here. Staff was pretty nice. They really need to pay attention to getting the salt down in front of the door the patrons wouldn't slip on their way into this place. The location isn't absolutely terrible, I think it's convenient especially because there's plenty of parking. Just a bit cramped. This location seemed older and a bit dated. 2 staff members for a busy location is not a good idea."}
{"text":"This place is nice and convenient. I still can't get over the smell of the Subway. I don't like the fact that my hair and clothes smell weird after going into a Subway. They do have a drive-thru that's really convenient (I kind of wished I used it) I was able to get the soup and sub which was a really good deal. This is a really nice location if you're looking for something other than McDonald's and the bar to have some lunch."}
{"text":"This subway was great. The girls working this morning shift were pleasant and friendly and fast. I was tired and not paying attention and they just laughed with me about it. They made my sandwich perfect with light this and extra that. Thanks ladies you made my tired morning a little easier"}
{"text":"As I parked in the lot tonight to go to DQ I see that this Subway has now closed. This does not surprise me since they had already cut back on their hours..."}
{"text":"Only one person making subs tonight at dinner hour at 5 p.m. And of course this lady in front of me was ordering up about 3 or 4 Subs.  I have never been in a Subway before that did not have at least two people working at dinner time."}
{"text":"Subway is not as good as it used to be 10 years ago. But lets be honest; it is still the best fast food place to eat at, and the only healthy fast food place to choose from these days. 
The staff at this location is as good as they come."}
{"text":"I'm biased b/c i worked here for two years while on campus. But this subway is much cleaner than the one on John St.  However, dont count on them staying open as late as they say on the door. Serving drunk college students is the worst job ever, so they often close before the already drunk pre-bar crowd"}
{"text":"I had a coupon where you buy a drink before 11:00AM and get a free 6 inch sandwich. All in all, it cost me like $1.23 or something for coffee and a breakfast sub. I got steak and cheese with egg. It was alright. Nothing amazing but it wasn't awful. The bread was soft. The produce was fresh. The kid was real quick and friendly and I tipped him the change."}
{"text":"Worst subway ive been to with the worst customer service ever they didnt even smile and looked mad when i asked them for something and im usually not the type of person to be rude because i myself worked at a fast food restaurant and know what its like to have rude people but these ladys looked like they hated there job and maybe they shouldn't work with people of there gonna have that attitude didnt even enjoy my food"}
{"text":"Don't go here. It is owned and operated by an Indian, and as a fellow Indian I know when I see a cheap Indian. The owner makes the subs and tries to put as little as possible on the sandwich. Your paying money for the guy to half way fill the scoops with meat and sprinkle a few lettuce on. Food is good, Clean environment, Cheap Owner. Don't go you won't get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"Poor poor service.   Service is unfriendly, lacks concern or respect for customers.   The coffee is horrible and the food sub-par at best."}
{"text":"This is a 24 hour subway and after visiting this location at several different days/times I can confidently say the staff are the nucest and funniest team members ive seen at a \"fast food\" eatery. All of the staff I have encountered so far have been quite young, but very polite and professional. The service is always super fast and everything tastes fresh."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this Subway (#22228) in Las Vegas, Nevada on 9/16/2015.  It was my 1st time  there.  It's inside the Four Queens Casino.  I had a 6 inch sub combo which came with chips and a drink for $10.99.  The service was quick and the food was good.  Plus, I took photos."}
{"text":"This is a very decent location, for a Subway. It's pretty new, so the decor and environment is still clean. The veggies are usually fresh, unlike 99% of subway locations. 

I have an acquaintance that has worked at several subway locations, so here's a tip...never trust their ice and water."}
{"text":"Slow. Produce is not fresh. Found nats in my lettuce."}
{"text":"Got a foot long tonight and I can't even finish half of it. The bread is hard!  Very disappointed. I don't go to subway often, but now I doubt I will again. Food at this location is obviously not fresh."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would.
Came here today for lunch.
Immediately the lady at the front had an attitude with us.
I decided not to order after she said: are you going to order or not.
I took my business to Panda Express.
My classmate still got a sandwich.
She proceeded to treat the guy behind us very nicely.
It was a little weird.
After my classmate ate most of her sandwich she noticed that the chicken was pink on the inside!
Like wtf are the standards at this place?
Never again unless you want undercooked chicken."}
{"text":"Subway is Subway, if you ask me. The sandwiches almost never vary and what really makes or breaks the place is the efficiency and employees. There was nothing wrong here--my sandwich was made well and the employees were very pleasant and eager to help. We weren't left to wait and didn't have to try to get someone's attention. When I asked about a weird coupon I had, they had answers immediately and didn't seem at all upset that I had asked something of them other than a sandwich order."}
{"text":"The employees as well as the sales manager always greet with a smile.  Incredibly courteous and fast to make a perfect subway every time!"}
{"text":"Ew. This place is horrible. Every time I go it always has dirty tables. The cookies are always out. Also a lot of the time their soda is out which is annoying when you are in a hurry. Usually the people that take make your sandwiches they sometimes are snotty and do a poor job."}
{"text":"It's fine.  It's your typical Subway.  The parking lot can be cramped.  It helps if you use the first driveway driving east on McDowell the SR-51 (after the \"house\"), and not the second (before Wendy's) due to the placement of the parking spaces of the Mexican restaurant.  Also note that their parking lot doesn't connect to Wendy's lot.  Lastly, hold your breath if the dumpster's lid is open!

The employees are very friendly here though, and they keep the sandwich line clean."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Subway.  Unless it's February for their Febru-Any specials.  I will say though it's funny most people post negative experiences.  As is normal, we tend to remember negative experiences more as good service is always expected.
    I have to say though this is your average run of the mill sub shop, nothing that will stand out and say man I love this place! But having said that, the dozens of times I've been here I've never had a negative experience unless you count them mixing onions in their lettuce who knows how many time lol but that's no biggie. 
    3 of 5 cause that's George W Bush... you know average... okay he had C average but you know dang well he bought that.  That's beyond the point though lol"}
{"text":"So I'm siting at the drive thru no ones there. I call and the girl answered said hi this is subway on warm springs and Cimiron I think.  I asked are you guys open I'm at the drive thru and no ones there. She said ugh yeah I just came on so, then I asked so yes your open? 

She hung up.

She gets the mic and seems a little slow. So I calm down she has difficulty on the order then gives me the wrong chips and roll her eyes at me when I ask if this is what I ordered. 

The first time I came no one answered and when I drove thru she was in there."}
{"text":"Can't complain about the place or the service but this location sucks. It's sketchy around these parts. The staff was friendly the place was pretty clean and the food was nicely presented."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised this subway only has 1 star! The staff is rude, unpleasant and just a bad experience. 
I will go out of my way next time to a different subway just to avoid this one."}
{"text":"We love Subways here & at home in CA. This one is open until 2am which is great after late night gambling. They always have a steady flow of customers so the food is fresh and hasnt been sitting out for long periods of time. At the hotel when u check-in they give u coupons that always have a 15% off Subway, plus u can use your BConnected points."}
{"text":"I thought i had written a review for this location on a previous visit to the Plaza but i guess not. I love the Plaza hotel located in downtown Vegas, hate this Subway. This was our 2nd time getting food here only because one of my daughters loves Subway and just cant wait until we get back home, shes the only one eatin here i refuse to pay $7 for a 6inch or $10footlong and thats just the sandwich add $3 to make it a combo, crazy. This place is so high, no deals like we have at home, i dont know if its because theyre inside a hotel or what and the customer service is so bad. The 2 times we've been here the people working behind the counter are playing with workers on the other side. Too laid back for me when it comes to my food i dont like ppl playing over it. My daughter needs to take a lesson from me on this and maybe her ass wouldnt get sick as much as she does from eatin out. If your craving a sandwich go to Cafe Latte located at the entrance of the hotel near registration great fresh food and customer service."}
{"text":"Thee was only two parking slot, that is Okay.
Seems it is family business there, the young guys(son) was really rude. 
The father wasn't clean, he didn't change plastic gloves for each of customers ..."}
{"text":"We walked in at 1:00 on a Saturday to a line at the door and one guy working...on a Saturday. Poor guy looked like he hated his life. I read the reviews about the owner, and after 10 minutes of an unmoving line, decided not to support an owner who would leave one worker in his shop on a Saturday alone."}
{"text":"Disgusting food and disgusting employees! I have tried this place maybe like 5 times in 3 Months just because it's the closest to me and I thought maybe I just came at the wrong time but wow! I was mistaken because my husband brought me home a tuna sandwich from that place today and that was the worst ever! It was old tuna! So I called to go get my money back and turned out they couldn't do anything about it until the next day when the manager was available... Mean while I'm starving n now making myself dinner... Worst thing ever! And yes I am extra mad because I am extra hungry"}
{"text":"Reported this disgusting restaurant twice to the city of Toronto food inspection and also to Subway. See picture for details."}
{"text":"I live 2 minutes away from this location and I rather drive further for another location. Every time I come here I always get attitude from the employees! It's ridiculous. One time they burnt my bread and they wouldn't give me a new one. They don't make their sandwiches with love."}
{"text":"One star for location.
One star for having a drive through.

However, when said drive through is slow and inaccurate it renders itself useless.  I probably could have overlooked this one time but you added green peppers to my sandwich and I hate green peppers. And you forgot the lettuce and the tomatoes are tasteless.

I can't say I will never go back because it's a Subway.  You like it one day and hate it thenext."}
{"text":"This is the worst place. I work grave came here to eat on my 30min lunch. Waited in line to eat leaving 20min left. Come to find out they won't take my debit card. Gave some excuse. Fuck you ppl! Unable to eat lunch now you fucking bastards. No remorse.... not like I have much option 2am in the morning."}
{"text":"Run, do not walk, run away from this Subway.  The food is expensive.  The servers are RUDE and serve people out of order.  They take forever to make your sandwich.  

As I was getting my sandwich, one of the sandwich makers SNEEZED above the vegetables.  

Those of you who know me know that I have an unnatural affection for Subway sandwiches.  I even like that weird Subway odor that one can smell when walking past a Subway or opening the front door to a Subway.  It pains me to write a unfavorable review of a Subway restaurant.  However, this Subway needs to visited by the health department and be shut down.  Or struck by lightning.  Some act by a higher power needs to occur so I can fly to McCarren airport without being reminded of this traumatic experience."}
{"text":"Always go to this subway every two weeks. Usually late at night, and Josh is the one who's always there. He makes the BEST sandwiches ever !! Make sure you go late at night"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner; the kids choice.  I was pleased with the service I received.  Sandwiches and chips.... perfect!"}
{"text":"Pro of this location is that it's open 24 hrs a day, which for night shift workers is a wonderful option. Another pro is they are usually fast and the restaurant is clean. 

One of my cons for this location is the lack of personality on the part of the night workers. The two different young men are generally irritated while waiting on me and I think they could use a shower nozzle and soap on themselves. 

Also on a side note when did subway get so expensive? If it's not a $5 sandwich, you are looking at a 7-8$ middle of the road item to eat. 

I'll go back because it's close to my employment..."}
{"text":"This location is near me but haven't been in until now. Clean place and food is standard for subway. But it is 12:30 on Saturday and there is 1 person working. Stood in line for about 20 minutes. More people came in but quickly left when they realized the situation. Never have I been in a subway with only 1 person working. Even during typical more slow times. Chatted with the girl behind me and she said this location is understaffed a lot. And the girl working didn't seem to move any faster... super slow and unapologetic."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, small portions of every ingredient you ask for; but the family's staff order something, they put extra of every ingredient. I witnessed it.

I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and always convenient, this is a great location. I love subway, well actually I love subs no matter where they're from but subway is different, their sandwiches are supposedly healthy since the franchise is own by a bunch of doctors and if doctors know what's good for you then subway is the way to go but that's actually what kept me away for a while until I realized that it was  just a marketing  gimmick and That you can find unhealthy food with awesome taste like anywhere else  and it was then when I became a subway regular. My favorite is the Italian BMT with extra pepperoni, pepper Jack cheese and mayonnaise on white bread.  mmm mmm so good! Heart attack grill's got nothing on you babe! But if that's not you and you prefer something healthy you can certainly find that at subway, and here's the list.....
                                                                      lettuce
                                                                      tomato
                                                                       onions..all that for five bucks!"}
{"text":"I spoke to one of owners Shane, this morning who refused to cancel my credit card transaction that I submitted to through the website and the one closest to me was not listed so the order went to the wrong one. I was told to contact Subway immediately and you can only email so I did. I also called the store and they said to call back in 10 minutes to have a chance to ask the \"manager's manager.\" I did and they said to come in within 24 hours and she (the I store manager) will refund it. I get an email the next day from Subway saying it is up to the store and I also get a call from Shane who says they threw out the sandwich and got charged to run my card so they would lose money so they cannot refund it. He said they called 45 mins after it was made to see if I was picking it up which they did not. I told him now I have to dispute it through my credit card company In 4 days if it posts. If I was on this side of town I'd rather go to Jersey Mikes with fresh sliced meat, cheese, and AMAZING bread (it is across the street near Teharu sushi (and inexpensive) which is also very good)."}
{"text":"2 young girls working. Need to learn better customer service skills! Definitely got the vibe that I was disturbing them when all I came there for was a sandwich."}
{"text":"Subways are all very comparable so normally I wouldn't post a review. This subway saved me on my trip from all the horribly unhealthy Pittsburg food choices. The staff was more than friendly on two occasions and impressed me enough to give two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Subway !

I have had subway sandwiches for as long as I can remember. So instead of writing about what this subway has I will write what is different than a typical subway. 
1. It is not heavily staffed during the evening hours. 
2. There is ample room to sit and enjoy and it is empty for the most part. 
3. They have Veggie patty, which is nice for vegetarians. 
4. Vegetables are not always fresh. 
5. The street parking is free after 6 pm and on sundays. 

Enjoy healthy food."}
{"text":"Just your average Subway. Quick food, fresh toppings just the way you want it."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years. I work nearby and live close. I have always had a very positive experience. Great Customer Service, good food and orders always correct. 2 weeks ago I didn't have that same experience. I walked in and noticed employee was speaking to another employee who was behind wall. I patiently waited and notice the one gentleman kept looking over at me. Never once saying I will be right with you, hello or anything. Finally after 10 minutes the man behind wall walked around and said \" Oh my Gosh I had no idea you were there. I am so sorry. Have you been waiting long? I said 10 minutes but I'm in no rush. The other gentleman ( the one who seen me)washed hands and said what do you want? I told him, he said toasted or no toasted? I said both toasted. He rolled eyes and toasted. I asked for what I wanted on each one. I noticed he forgot tomato on the one and mentioned it. Very loud he stated \" Next time tell me exactly what you want.\" I asked for a little more Mayo and he rolled eyes, shaking his head huffing and puffing. On the other sub he missed 3 of the 6 things I wanted. I didn't say anything because of his reaction with first sub. Checking out I asked what is your name, he said why? I said could I please have your name? He ignored me, placed change on counter and walked away. I never do surveys but I did that day. As a manager if I reviewed a survey like the one I left.... I would of immediately reached out to customer and apologized. Never heard anything at all. I will be driving extra mile to different location. Not acceptable!"}
{"text":"Not a bad joint. Came at lunch so it was busy but my order was completed within 5 minutes of being there. Friendly people. Yeah it's in the ghetto and yes there is allot of ghetto trash who go here but overall I would come in here again for a quick lunch from work. Wouldn't want to come here with my kids or wife tho."}
{"text":"Young black woman stole my $10 bill. I thought a sandwhich with a drink was over 10 bucks. So I hand out 2 10 dollar bills, I get 25 cents back. Receipt machine wasn't working at the time either. I ask the lady who rang me up and she said I only gave her 2 5 dollar bills. Bull crap. I know you pocketed that you POS. I'm not coming here again as long as she is around. I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I usually don't prefer subway for my sandwiches I actually prefer jersey mikes, port of subs, capriottis, etc. not only because the sandwiches are great, but the employees are always always awesome, friendly, and super nice. Lately since I've tried subways new wrap I've been coming here a lot more than usual.

S. highlands location is usually not my go to subway I usually go to other locations even if this one is right down the street from my house because the service here is not so great. 

Anyways, I decided to have a wrap this morning and I get the same thing every single time,which is the savory chicken with extra lettuce and spinach (not even a lot, just a little bit more than they give) provolone cheese, olives, tomatoes, and the Caesar dressing. Today I had the worse service at subway. I was helped by an older man kind of bald with glasses. 

When I asked for extra lettuce and tomatoes he just shook his head and said it can't be done I have to follow the rules and I said just a little extra, so then he gets frustrated and just throws lettuce and spinach on the wrap while shaking his head the whole time. I didn't even ask for a lot he actually added more than I wanted. But out of his frustration he didn't even try to wrap it nicely!

I thought it was very rude and unprofessional. While continuing to make my wrap he continued to shake his head the whole time. I said I have never had this issue before I get the same wrap all the time, requesting the same toppings and just replied, \" well their doing it wrong!\" If good customer service and smiling back at your customers is wrong, then I guess I won't be returning to this location. I'd rather drive farther than come back to this one.

I understand about rules, it's just the way he handled the situation.  I almost didn't even want the sandwich anymore because he was rude, but I didn't want to be rude and walk away which I should I have."}
{"text":"Disappointed!
I went in rushing because they were closing in 5 minutes and yes I know it can be annoying to be the last customers. But the lady decided to lie to me that  her \" register was broken and it would let her ring someone out past 10pm and that it was ahead five minutes\" just bec she did not want to make one more sandwich and my sandwiches are the easiest I get tuna with just lettuce on it! Very upsetting.  Her excuse didn't even make sense. The reason I know they weren't having computer problems is bec the day before some dude was raving they got new computers. Very annoying."}
{"text":"I have to totally agree with the first reviewer here. This Subway is awful! The woman working behind the counter has such limited English speaking ability it is difficult to communicate. And she WILL argue with you so beware. I had a breakfast sandwich and I have had them before at other locations but this one was terrible. She didn't heat the bacon so when she added it to the overcooked hot eggs it got soggy and slimy and gross!! I couldn't eat the slimy bacon so I took it off the sandwich and just ate the egg, cheese and tomato. 

I wanted some sugar for my coffee and she pointed to where it is supposed to be and I didn't see it so I told her it wasn't there. She told me it was there and came out from behind the counter and pointed at the sugar substitute. I told her that wasn't sugar and she disagreed. I told her sugar was usually in white packages. She finally understood and went to the back and found me sugar. And frankly, the coffee wasn't that good either. 

So, bottom line is bad service, attitude, communication, food and coffee. Not going back!"}
{"text":"Only one staff at dinner hours and chatting with customers in line and slowly making sandwich. No urgency to move the line."}
{"text":"Very rude, very sarcastic, bad attitude. I could understand why the sub artist was upset because she was the only one there but for taking it out on her customer's is terrible, we tried to be patient with her but she was a total *bleep*, never again. I think the woman's name was Jennifer. Doesn't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"After my last visit I have decided to just avoid this store and walk to Safeway for sandwich supplies."}
{"text":"The service is BAD!!!!! The place is dirty and the staff is more interested in goofing off than taking care of business. The subs at Fry's are just as good and you won't have to wait a ridiculous amount of time to get one. This location is busy ... but not because it's anything special. I think they could really use a management team? Someone needs to step in and clean things up."}
{"text":"I went in and placed my order, and gave the guy a coupon to use... And he said they don't take coupons. No where on the coupon does it specify specific locations or anything like that, and I ended up paying twice what I thought I was going to pay. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe my son just went to get a sub I was starting to get worried because it's a few minutes from the house when he went in there and had to wait 10 minutes before ringing the bell and then no one still appeared for another two minutes.  And then was rude like yeah?  Well??   That's my money he's spending and I could've spent it somewhere else....my son is turning 19 is not a child you should not be treated like some obsolete teenager.  Maybe he will the guy up from a nap who knows....my sons to mellow to be upset....but I'm at said that he had to do that and be gone so long that I had to worry about him driving."}
{"text":"No napkins, dirty food set up and just slow up in their heads! A guy just crumpled a wash towel and serve it inside my plate, Very nasty."}
{"text":"I own a business off of Craig street and l am  sometimes forced to eat the food on this strip. Yesterday was the day. The people are so rude, they hardly made eye contact. The actual food l received wasn't fit to feed my dog. Seriously, skip this place. Forget what l said, don't skip, run for your life."}
{"text":"Although the sign says they open at 7, They have the door open and are making food but the jerk behind the counter tells me they're closed. maybe next time lock the door and treat everyone the same!!!!"}
{"text":"This visit downgraded this store. You go in on the pretense of $5 any foot long. You get a roast beef and they call it a premium sandwich and charge $8!  Give me a break. It's a single meat sandwich. They just lost a regular customer over $3."}
{"text":"Whoever the female blonde with glasses working today at 1pm was extremely rude. When I called her on it, she got an even bigger attitude. Should hire someone who appreciates a job and tries their best to put on a good attitude. I'm sorry you hate working at Subway. I didn't make you work here. Don't take it out on me. It's amazing how someone her age doesn't understand the basics of dealing with the public. I'm a reasonable person but I'm not going to get talked downed to by a stranger who I'm giving my money to. Subway should have higher standards. Any business dealing with the public should."}
{"text":"Ordered an egg & omelet foot-long, right on the menu. Couldn't make it, she said....only during breakfast hours. I pointed out it is on their all-day menu, as in every Subway on earth. She summoned the manager, who agreed with the help. I pointed it out on the all-day menu, in bold letters. She turned and stared the menu for a full minute.. That was a long wait. Finally she turned and  explained it's not a foot-long, bur only an omelet...no bread. This was the manager! I should've called her bluff & asked to go ahead and make me an omelet....I'm sure it would have been comical. Instead I told her to forget it, and got myself something at the Chipotle Grill nearby. I think this Subway has a training problem!."}
{"text":"There was meat on the cheese slices, onions mixed in with the other veggies.  Not your usual clean Subway.  I have been to Subways in third world countries that were cleaner than this place.
The girl behind the counter was not friendly either.
She barked at me when I entered the building.
I love Subway, but will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and the place was clean. The employees were nice, but undertrained. 
I had to repeat my order several times. 
Food turned out well."}
{"text":"Not too much to comment on about the food other than the meatballs are...you know...meatballs. You should know by this point if you like Subway or not. Take it for what it is.

The staff here is incredibly cool, though. Very friendly , good at getting the order right, and if you come in frequently enough and order the same thing, they'll even give you a cool nickname like, \"Hey Mr. Meatball!\". 

Yeah, they're pretty cool here."}
{"text":"I'm not a big subway guy, but this one is close to the gym, and they do a good job.  There place is always clean, the food is fresh, they are friendly(especially Alex), and it's what you hope you get when you go to a subway."}
{"text":"The only subway I've ever seen with no $5.00 footlongs.

Wanted a veggie sandwich which is usually 5 bucks and it said 625... not to sure u ow that is possible when subway is a national franchise...


#ripoff"}
{"text":"Never go through the drive thru!   I had a 2 sandwich order. Nothing major and the gal still got it wrong even though she wrote everything down."}
{"text":"First time visiting this Subway.

Walked in and immediately saw a female employee throwing the topping scraps back into the containers with her BARE HANDS-NO GLOVES. Not to mention her nail polish was chipped and her hands looked visibly dirty.

I instantly turned around and walked back out like I had seen a ghost."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly but the bread was STALE. 

Homeless man out front with all of his belongings asking for change.


I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"This is a great sub place if you like subs made with pre-sliced, bucketed meat on crumbly, stale bread that disintegrates when touched by vinegar or tomatoes, or just by taking a bite.  In a word: DISGUSTING.  Good service, though, can't complain about that.  Sadly, that's not enough for me to give this place more than one star (although it really deserves zero)."}
{"text":"This is our favorite location because Thomas is always so happy and friendly!  Always has a smile on his face and a quick joke on his lips!  They always make a great sandwich but with That going the extra mile he makes this location standout!"}
{"text":"Service was great. I just left and the guy working behind the counter had such a good personality and attitude. Highly recommend. His excellent customer service makes a big difference."}
{"text":"The 21 year old girl behind the counter deserves her own franchise today!!! I have eaten here many times over a two year period and she is nothing but smiles and very pro subway..She can make anybody's day happy whether the food is good or not...she is a good example of how a restaurant should treat its clients or customers upon arrival of their own restaurant...Subway executives please give her that location she is unbelievably the best customer service I've had other than running my own business..."}
{"text":"The woman who works here is so, so rude. And mean about it to boot. I got yelled at for knocking on the bathroom door to see if someone was in there. It's well worth the drive to go to the one on Broadview from now on."}
{"text":"Today was my unlucky day at the Subway in the El Cortez Hotel on Fremont Street/6th & Ogden. There was only 1 person working at the counter and it took forever despite the fact that there were only 2 people ahead of me on line. The woman's nametag said Miriam and she was in a funky mood with all the customers. I was very cheerful as I placed my order. As she assembled the sandwiches I asked her to place a word on the sandwich paper so that I would know which one was which. As she stuffed both orders in the same bag I asked, \"Did you mark one of them so I would know which one was mine?\" And she said no as she shoved the bag toward me and walked away. It was a bit disturbing when I noticed that she wasn't washing her hands after touching cash before she took the next customer. I don't plan on going back to Subway if staffers doesn't practice good hygiene. And as for the sandwiches, I just as well toss them out."}
{"text":"Its a Subway. Nice & Clean. But the service is usually awful. Really unfriendly management. The employees seem to hate being there."}
{"text":"This location was clean and open. The parking lot is kinda annoying because there are certain spots designated for the smoke shop next door and certain ones for subway. Chyson, the sandwich maker, was verrrryyyy chatty and tried to engage the guest who came in before me, me and the guest who came in after me. I guess when you're the ONLY person working somewhere you might get a little lonely."}
{"text":"This seems like a regular run-of-the-mill subway. The reason that I'm giving it 4 stars is because Maria, the sandwich maker, was so exceedingly patient while I was on the phone the entire time.  I'm sure they see rude people like that all the time but I appreciate how accommodating She was nonetheless."}
{"text":"Every time I've had the pastrami sandwich here I've gotten sick so I will no longer be coming back. I wanted to give them many tries and it still keeps happening so I have to think it's that."}
{"text":"My friend just got back with a \"sandwich\" from this location.  They gave her 2 slices of turkey!!! What a joke.  This place is just ridiculous.  If you want Subway go to another location.  This one sucks.  She also mentioned that there is a communication problem here because they do not speak English."}
{"text":"Such a great location for a Subway. Loved coming here. The clerk, Christy, was extremely friendly and service was fast as well. Will definitely be stopping here on future occasions."}
{"text":"I came for the buy one get one free deal because I'd like to support charities and they also gave a sandwich to charity for every one that you bought. The \"brunette\" girl who made my sandwich was very nice very sweet very professional she look like she actually liked her job. She made the sandwiches very neat because sometimes they're just thrown together but that wasn't the case here. This location is right by my house and this was the first time I've been there. Very pleasant experience! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Hi everyone! For this review I really can't complain. The staff was alert and had great attitudes. Subway is just overall a great choice; foot long, regular drink and chips all for 11 bucks. No crazy promos to report on so stay tune"}
{"text":"1 star because the employee did not understand english.  OK, thats fine, but when I cannot even order, I start to get frustrated and I order a sandwich and she look back at the menu where I was looking and starts to make the sandwich.  I told her I had to go because I was in a hurry and she did not understand.  I love the fact she wanted to work to provide for her family, but please learn the language first.  It will make your life so much easier and others so much less stressed.  Overall I am glad I just walked away and went to my room.  Maybe next stay will be better."}
{"text":"This is not a good subway. I was just there. I got a tuna sandwich. It was disgusting. I asked for it to be toasted, they toasted it with the veggies in it. Who does that? I went to the drive through I waited like 15 minutes. I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"When you go to this location and they sell TURKEY BACON WRAP but they don't wanna sell me turkey bacon for my bacon ranch melt it's so stupid now I know why is this place always empty horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Out of meatballs, out of rotisserie chicken (THE PROMO).  Nice enough staff and location.  Limited options at noon on a Tuesday. I have never seen so many ingredients out at a subway.  Just came to use a coupon."}
{"text":"Boy, their attitudes sure do suck, and their subs are so unbelievably nasty.  Uuuggghhh!"}
{"text":"I go to subways two-three times a week all over the valley (drive lot for work) I've probably been to 30 different subways. This location has the softest, freshest bread I've ever had from a subway by far. Whatever you are doing.... keep it up"}
{"text":"I work at the new animal hospital that opened in the same \"shopping center\" so I've been coming here a lot on my breaks considering how conveniently close it is. Yesterday I stopped in just for chips and a drink since I already had lunch and just wanted a quick snack. I went straight to the register considering I wasn't ordering a sandwich and the cashier or an employee who I thought was a cashier completely ignored me! She just continued to check herself out for lunch, and did not say one word to me, not even when I was in her way to swipe her credit card she just worked her way around me standing in front of the machine and kept on doing her thing. I even said \"no sandwich just these two please\" and she walked away with no words! After the real cashier checked out the guy she was making a sandwich for not me, she finally says \"welcome to subway, no sandwich?\" I'm not sure what was wrong with these employees and I know they are open 24 hours but wow. This experience makes me never want to return ever again I may as well buy the fake food at Dairy Queen next door."}
{"text":"Standard Subway fare, nothing special but reliably fast and tasty enough. Although Subway is definitely not the most healthy of lunch choices (salt, for example) it suffices when in a rush and you just want something quick to eat.

For a change, I had the spinach instead of regular lettuce and it made all the difference. Although I am not a fan of pre-prepared vegetables and other ingredients, it was quite tasty and lasted me until dinner.

The daily specials are definitely the ones to go for, as this reduces the cost quite a bit. Subway can be expensive otherwise."}
{"text":"I am not sure if there is even any management at this location as all the employees don't seem to have the proper training. The employees have a bad attitude and don't seem to care about their job or the product that goes out to customers. I am pretty sure if there was to be a health inspection they would probably fail, it seemed EXTREMELY unsanitary. I asked for soup and was told they didn't have any. I asked again as I saw the containers and this employee said \"Do you really want soup? I'll ask (her) if she wants to go ahead and make some if you really want it.\" I couldn't believe that an establishment inside of a Hotel/Casino (Venetian) is allowed to operate with such poor management. I don't know how much business has been lost due to poor attitude and telling people they are out of product just because they are to lazy to make it. I hope something gets done about this as this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I try to avoid coming to this location if at all possible. I work nearby and sometimes while running errands at lunch I decide to give this location another shot...so wrong! The attitudes at this location are completely awful. The sad part is that this location has NO chance to succeed since the manager (I believe Cleo) has an awful attitude that you can see allover his face and by his body language. He acts like you are bothering him by coming in. Sandwich is \"eh\" and the presentation is crappy. Today my sandwich was thrown half wrapped in a bag without even 1 napkin. Everyone should know that Subway doesn't have napkins out and you have to bother the staff to get any. Bothering the staff is the issue!

With other options in the area I would advise go somewhere else and get your sub fix later."}
{"text":"This is best subway in the foothills. You are in and out fast and they are nice.

I have been here many times and always had a good experience. I was there today and there was a short line. I got my sandwhich and paid in 4 mins. Jose made my sandwhich and he was a machine. He banged out my veggy sandwhich super fast."}
{"text":"At the moment this one of worst subways that I regularly go to. The service is terrible here. The kids behind the counter are usually rude and dismissive. There is one tall kid that is good and one girl that is also good. Other than that, they rush you through sandwhich making process asking \"is that it?\" with a snarl. They actually complain about their hours and their management to the customers. 

They clearly need guidance on good customer service. It's too bad this subway is closest to my home."}
{"text":"As my regular lunch stop and my co-workers as well, although its a chain sammie shop... the customer service offered here is above average & they always greet me warmly, and customize my sandwiches specifically and make me want to return. Also, cookies always taste fresh and yummy. Come here for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Over charged....  Slowest subway i have ever been in shut it down. the girl did seem new should probably put her on the register when it is busy like it was really shouldn't have to read the sandwich manual when making the club... Took twenty mins to serve 4people"}
{"text":"Decided to get myself a Subway sandwich. Oh wait I couldn't. The worker wouldn't let me in to order. After I rang the door bell twice, and on the second time I rang I made direct eye contact with the worker, she presumed to ignore me. After 5 minutes of waiting I decided enough was enough and I left. I would say I had terrible service but that would require me to to actually get served."}
{"text":"I went tonight the last 3 times I bern there they only have one person work ok I'll deal but it's a long wait I ask for honey oat got wheat girl had to be told to wash her hands and then she's was kinda rude  this place needs more than one person  at night......."}
{"text":"I had a BOGO coupon for this location and was told they don't accept coupons as they're privately owned. Fair enough but seems odd and at the very least is an awful business practice. Two stars for at least being open late until 3AM but if there were more options in the area I'd take my business elsewhere. There is a Wendy's and Ritters diner nearby FYI."}
{"text":"Young lady told me thy did not have my type of bread, told me \"cause we been busy\" its 3 pm. Then she processed to half cut and smash both my footlongs. Ended up wth min meat at best. I can find another regular sandwich shop to spend my $ at. No excuse for 3 employees to that slow and rude at 3pm"}
{"text":"Decent.  They try to work through everyone as quick as possible.  They do make the sandwiches correctly here, unlike some subways that cut corners.

Occasionally, you get some YASS-HO that orders $125 worth of subs at 12 PM during everyone's lunch time.  Yes, that happened and yes the staff did the best they could.  

I go here often, so I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I consistently have a superior experience in this store. Friendliness, cleanliness, and quality are above most other subways. I have been in about a million subways in my travels, and I'm lucky that this one is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I don't really like subway but I'm writing this review for an employee. It's really cool that this place is close by and 24hours but this guy makes these average subs much better! I really don't know what it is but it's just the right amount of ingredients that I've never been able to get at other  subway. And he's seriously always nice and offers to toast the sub (even though I don't) but he always seems happy and just ready to grind and make his money the best he can and I really respect that. I don't remember his name (and I know it's super not pc) but I really want him to get recognition he has a tat on his forearm African American shorter (my height ish)  maybe 5-5 but the dude just makes me feel better and better about this place. Hire more people like this dude!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and food was fresh! We were helped right away. Came in yesterday for lunch."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to agree as well. Since the change in ownership, this Subway has really gone downhill. I frequent many restaurants, some in Mahomet, where it's clear the owners are not native English speakers, but communication at this Subway is next to impossible. I swore I wouldn't go back, and then even decided it couldn't be as bad and tried again, only to find, after I finally got the woman to understand I wanted a salad, the portions were ridiculously small. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I ordered a subway club, I received a sandwich with 2 pieces of ham, one on each side of my footling. Half of my foot long had turkey the other half had roast beef.  Lettuce and tomato oil and vinegar.  The meat wasn't even on the sandwich and could not taste the oil and vinegar.  Worst sandwich I ever had.  It's clear too me he didn't know what he was doing.  This was my second visit I always give a place a second chance.
First visit did not go well I waited 15 mins.  For the girl to make a sub then she ignored me and went on to do 3 subs for the drive up window.  She never said hello, I'll be right with you or nothing.  2 nd visit no hello and no thank you either.  I'll will go to another location or another restaurant."}
{"text":"I noticed the negative reviews for this Subway. This is my first trip to this store and found it to be outstanding. Both employees were busy, but very attentive to the customers needs. The restaurant was clean and organized. I ordered my sub via Subway app and it d done perfectly and on time. Great job, kids!"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. They seem to think that starting to make a sandwich for everyone in line at once, will somehow speed up the process. If I'm first in line, I don't want to wait for you to help the next six people behind me before I can pay and get on with my day."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Subway in a while, but boy have they gotten skimpy on the fillings. I realize they are cheaper than other sand which places, but I would rather pay a little for a sandwich that actually has substance."}
{"text":"The owner prevented me to refill my drinks more than 3 times, which was absurd.

And their steak filling tasted stale, pretty disgusting."}
{"text":"This will be my 2nd time coming to this subway and every time I go I have to wait over 20 mins to get my sandwich !!"}
{"text":"I never post reviews for fast food restaurants but this one deserved one! I might be OCD about cleanliness so maybe this is why it's a big deal to me...

I go here sometimes after the gym if I don't feel like cooking. My gosh this has got to be the cleanest restaurant in Vegas I have ever been to. I like how it's 24/7 now. The blonde girl that makes my sandwiches is great. She places everything so neatly and evenly. (Usually other Subways just pile everything on top of one another.) Great place you have here thank you!"}
{"text":"Kind artists, but they often run out of popular selections. If you do not mind calling an audible, you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"All Subways are not created equal.  At this location in particular, the bread and the ingredients were so fresh.  So fresh that the tomatoes had a nice crunch to it.  There wasn't a spot on brown lettuce anywhere ... that was a little unfamiliar with me because I'm used to noticing a few brown spots on lettuce at many different locations.  The bread taste as if it was baked right before I got there.  It was perfect!  

I picked up a Subway Club sandwich on Italian Herb and Cheese with all my favorite fixings ... Lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles, green peppers, banana peppers, oregano, pepper, oil and Subway Vinaigrette, mayo and spicy mustard. I got it toasted.  I took a few bites the minute I got it and saved the rest of lunch the next day.  It was just as good as it was during the first bite.  I'd definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"usually lacking in customer service.. hardly friendly or inviting. today was different. I was impressed by the young man who made my sandwich. he was clean and on point. thanks dude!! ur efforts are noticed!

{"text":"Friendly staff always provide great customer service. Staff always offer promotion deals. Quick and efficient service."}
{"text":"I wanted a sub before work and it is 2 am ! Nope these fuckers are prob. Sleeping i wanted subway ! Oh well missed out on my 50$ ! Might be a while since i come back ASSHOLES!"}
{"text":"Great location, and employees! The manager was very nice. Place was vey clean, I will be back."}
{"text":"As with many other Americans, I have been to several Subway locations across the US so do not read this review any further if you are looking for a review on the food itself. This is a service review and this particular location has taken service one step above the rest. The employees (who seem to be all male) are fast, friendly and generally seem happy to be working. We've all been to the business where employees mess around inappropriately at work, but these guys find the medium between play and business which always makes for a memorable, professional experience. In the three times I have visited, I have never been disappointed and have always walked out with a smile on my face. I will surely return!"}
{"text":"I shouldn't let one visit weigh so heavily but the older lady with glasses that works here had me ready to walk out. She couldn't say anything at all let alone be courteous about it. She clearly hated her job and had no problem showing it. The other employees were nice however. Next time I'll just ask for someone else to help. If you hate people, don't work in customer service..."}
{"text":"One of the worst managers of a Subway ever!  The workers are jammed, b/c short staffed, the supplies are barely adequate, and the manager is sarcastic and flippant.  There is a much better subway on west Bethany Home near the freeway."}
{"text":"This subway is the best!  It is clean, orderly and the owners and family work there.  They genuinely treat customers and each other with respect and take pride in their little store and the food they serve.  I go out of my way to eat there b/c it is such a lovely experience for a deli sandwich.  I know they are limited in what they serve b/c it is a franchise and controlled by the parent company.  But, they make it as good of an experience and keep the food stocked, clean and organized as they can."}
{"text":"Used to be a huge fan of Subway. I do still like it from time to time. Went into this store tonight and there was a new trainee there. No big deal for me. The problem was the other girl there with him. She was rude, unfriendly and not professional at all. When I tried talking and joking around with them she just looked at me and didn't respond at all. I even asked a question direct to her and just blew me off and walked into the back. Now I'm all about giving the person the benefit of the doubt and that maybe they were just having a really horrible day. But to not answer a question asked directly to you is just plain rude. On top of that there were very little toppings put on the sand which at all. I pretty much at just bread...worst Subway I've been in."}
{"text":"First subway I've ever been to that doesn't offer salads. Every other one I've been to you can order their sandwiches into a salad. Lady behind counter was very rude and said \"just pick a bread\" hardly could understand her. Eat fit huh subway? Well not offering an alternative to bread is not eating fit!"}
{"text":"I try hard not to review franchises, and I will continuously refrain from doing so - but this is an exception. 

Subway is Subway is Subway.. but at this place, the service is well above the expectation. Courteous personnel, that smile. But the real plus is that the don't skimp on the veggies. If you ask them, they will load that sub up. 

So it's still only a Subway, but for a Subway - this one sets a new  standard. 
..aaaand they are open 24 hours. 

Nanananabooboo.."}
{"text":"The dude with glasses was awesome as fuck! He gave me a ton of ranch and chipotle. And gave me a thing of baby soup. Yum! Love him!!! Going back once a week. You da best! Stay 100 ^_^




Also ps: it's very clean"}
{"text":"I eat subways at least 3 times a week and this is the closes subway to my house therefore I am extremely disappointed that I hate this location. I gave it multiples chances and it let me down every time. 

Service was always bad and they don't know how to make a sandwich. I went one time and stood there waiting for someone to come out and help me and no one ever came out. I waited a good 5 mins. This was the last straw. 

Couple times I went and the lady was rude and made the sandwich horrible. 

I did go one time and it was a younger girl working and she was nice and made my sub good. Never saw her working again."}
{"text":"I honestly don't eat here but kids love to go here for a quick bite right after school. First, its very convenient having this place 24/7, staff are very nice and place is quite clean. Whenever we come here there's no line, we're always in and out or I also enjoy sitting here watching the kids gobbled their subway sandwiches or flatbread with a smile! Nothing beats that.! Load the kids carbs before the game can make you a hero!"}
{"text":"It's Subway...tastes the same everywhere you go...at least this place is next to my gym and they get you in and out really quick! nuff said!"}
{"text":"Standard subway except I can't get water without paying $.25 for a plastic clear cup!  When was the last time you were charged for water, amazing how the little things turn the review negative."}
{"text":"This subway is always clean, open late and very friendly staff. I also wanted to mention that the one staff member John is exceptionally good at his job, he always remembers my order, perfectly extra toasts my sub, and is very quick! I find that more customer service should be like his and for that, this is my go to subway.  I can only hope he's always working when I go to get my sandwich"}
{"text":"Slow service, stale bread and bums in front blocking the door.  Very sad. 

I almost drove away when i saw the bums, but in Vegas it is nearly impossible to avoid them so i pressed on. 

Huge mistake.  

Do not recommend. ."}
{"text":"I hate how they serve the subs in a small basket instead of a tray, it was really inconvenient since their tables were pretty dirty.

Do not order anything with eggs, they are actually pre-cooked and frozen for god-knows-how-long. The Sriracha Steak Sub was delicious though, since the sauce was great."}
{"text":"At the Subway in Ballys I met an extremely rude food server. I asked to try the broccoli soup. The soup was all cream so I asked him why. He said we are out and I asked if he was getting more. He said well it will take a few minutes. I said ok I will wait. He rolled his eyes came back and said we don't have any need to thaw it out. I said ok how long. He again shrugged and said will be awhile. The female working said the soup is often watery just comes that way sometimes. I said to Saui if you don't care and don't want to sell me soup just say so but to date you are the rudest person I have met in Vegas. His response was there are other Subways in town go find one. I am shocked a brand such as Subway can employ 2 rude and non trained staff."}
{"text":"Came to try the Italian Famous, had a great experience the staff were polite, efficient, friendly and very accommodating, place was clean and the sandwich was great! I recommend this place. Five stars goes to handsome James & Dexter"}
{"text":"There are two things you can do to impress me. The first is blow me

out of the water with great service. The second is to be cold but super competent. At a regular restaurant these two issues are typically what makes or breaks your experience and speaks to whether you'll ever return. But at a fast food joint like Subway, you'll keep coming back even if you hate it because, hey, $5 footlong. 

Which is what makes this Subway so special. The staff makes a conscious effort to get to know you and remember you, even though you'd be back, even if they called you turd noggin every time you came through. The number of times I hear the guy greet customers with a, \"six inch pizza on whole wheat?\" and have them nod in appreciation does my head in. The Sandwich Artists (and indeed they are) who work the toppings bar are focused and attentive, putting the right amount of everything on, but always open to tossing in another handful of banana peppers if the occasion calls for it. And they make sure that the sandwich holds together! When it gets wrapped, you know you'll have a sub after your walk back to the office, not some glob of bread and turkey that you get when people don't package everything correctly. It's a simple thing, but that kind of attention to detail means everything - especially when there are a hundred similar places around. 

This is MY lunch place, and the consistency and pleasantness of the experience will keep me coming back, long after I get fired and don't even work in the neighborhood anymore."}
{"text":"The staff is attentive and the place is clean. My sandwich is always made the exact same every single time, which is a HUGE plus! I don't go in often, but this subway location still tastes fresh! There is always good music playing, and I never seem to have complaints. It's a quick stop, within minutes I am leaving the small spaced restaurant to head home!"}
{"text":"I love subway, and I'm planningnon going for lunch today to get my $5 footling tuna sandwich ^~^ awwwwsomewe"}
{"text":"The folks here are always welcoming and polite. I'm always greeted with a smile and friendly people."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for a quick breakfast! This is the first subway I've been to, that they make your eggs to order not some premade folded eggs,....add your favorite toppings. I love onions,  tomatoes,  bell peppers and spinach with topped with fresh avocado and black pepper = delicious!"}
{"text":"The lady in here at 230 am had the door locked and made me wait for her to finish what she was doing before she even acknowledged me . Then said nothing until she started making the sand which . And I asked her to toast my sandwich and looked at me like I was dumb and said the toaster was down Right now . Okay ? It's hard to have a bad experience at subway . Thank you for that ."}
{"text":"Ugh. Nope.  Not going back. Never.  With another subway 2 blocks up on 5th Avenue and 8th Street I won't go into Crack Macs subway again.  

Let's start at the beginning. Walk up the stairs to Subway and there's no one at the sandwich counter. I wait. And wait. And wait. Finally after about 7 minutes I call out \"Uhm hello? \" Nothing.  I call out again and get \"Stop yelling.  I'm right here. Jeez.!\" 

Strike 1. 

No hello how can I help you. Instead I get a growled \"are you ordering something? \" (no I'm here for your sparkling personality.) 

Strike 2.

After telling the sandwich 'artist' what bread I wanted and what sandwich his personal cell phone rang. AND HE ANSWERED IT.  Left my sandwich sitting on the counter and proceeds to chat.  Finished his call and goes back to making my sub without changing his gloves.   I ask politely for him to redo my sub and he grumbles something under his breath. Proceeds to make a new one, I'm happy. Till he rings through 2 yes 2 subs. I mention I'm only paying for one he grumbles some more, and charges me for one. 

Strike 3 (deserving of a phone call to head office on Monday) 

I ask for a receipt and a bag and he tells me that they don't provide receipts for single subs and they only give bags when you get a combo. UGH. Then. I get home and my sub is slathered in siracha sauce. Awesome. Never again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Subway location in Las Vegas. Very clean environment. It's never crowded and the bread is fluffy and soft. Staff is nice as well."}
{"text":"I've had a horrible experience here. The sandwich artist was extremely rude to me after being nothing but pleasant (I work in the food service industry, I know what it's like to have a rude customer). I was having a horrible day and when she was horribly rude to me I started crying and she laughed. I attempted to contact Subway management through the online form and nothing. I will never go this Subway ever again and I hope if management sees this know that this has got to change."}
{"text":"I love this subway location for one it's close to my house so it like a 10 minute to 15 minute walk from my house.

Two the staff is super friendly from the moment you walk in they greet you and talk to you. And finally the ingredients are fresh and cheap and they have my favorite the peanut butter cookies and the chocolate chip cookies which are really good and fresh and they always have good deals going on."}
{"text":"Clean. And they always have tomatoes. After a few times they even remembered my ordered and asked if I wanted the \"usual\". Cloes to work and convenient"}
{"text":"As of 11/17/17 no gluten free bread, sorry all who are afflicted with this irritating allergy. However, if you are not GF these guys are always working hard with a smile on their face, like they are just happy to be here. Great service though, 4 out of five (relative to other subway restaurants)."}
{"text":"Well sorry guys, as of 11/17/17 no gluten free bread here. Place seems clean, wait staff is as to be expected (underpaid and hoping for a better opportunity than subway). Picked up a sub here before the gluten allergy developed and there was one worker talking  to some guy the whole time she was making my sandwich. That was not the case this time, and I did not see that particular worker there."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant is too greedy to run it well.  There is never enough staff to serve their customers well.  Their employees seem to have very little training, and there is never a manager around to help them.  Unfortunately, I find this on par with ALL subway restaurants in Las Vegas.  Try a Port of subs, or Jersey Mikes.  They always have enough staff to serve their customers in a timely manner.  To the management of these subway stores, You are a failure."}
{"text":"Give customers a hard time when adding topping. Puts on 3 olive slices at a time makes you keep asking for more. Then makes comments about what they think you can ask for."}
{"text":"The workers were more interested in their personal conversations than helping out the customers. I tried ordering and it seemed like I was bothering them any time I got another piece to my sandwich. Definitely a lot dirtier than most locations too. With all the locations around I doubt I'll be back to this one."}
{"text":"Clean, well-run Subway. 

Limited number of seats...more suited for take-out...or \"take-away\" as my UK colleagues would say."}
{"text":"The employees at this subway are not very friendly and we had the dryest bread I have ever had at a subway.  We had to take the stuff out of the bread and eat it that way."}
{"text":"I love this Subway, best in the area! Fresh toppings great service.  Sandwiches are always perfectly made. its a small location so don't bring a crowd but its just me and my honey so its the location I choose everytime. Its a newer location with modern features and is always looking fresh and clean. What can I say everyone knows Subway, this just happens to be the best in Glendale in my opinion, happy yelping my friends"}
{"text":"I love this subway. Very friendly staff that remember you when you come back. Very clean establishment."}
{"text":"I stopped by this location because I was craving for a sub after what I saw and experience I will for sure not return to this location I rather go to the subway down the street at Walmart where the staff is more friendly than the ones at this location.

Not only that but I don't wanna walk in to a subway when the dinning room has a very strong odor and how the tables were not ready  for its customers.. yea subway has been notified but never heard from anyone.."}
{"text":"2nd time here and Nathan's energy very positive and personable. This man needs a raise...The lobby is clean and the sandwiches are put together well."}
{"text":"Is your dad a baker because your buns are fantastic... Just kidding..

Okay let's get serious. Everyone loves the consistency of a subway experience and you get that here. The staff seem to work almost 7 days a week. Not sure how they do that but almost always the same people there. Not complaining though as they are fast and efficient. 

Food quality
I stop by this location 3 to 4 times a week and the ingredients are fresh with good taste to it. 

Location
This location has a big sidewalk so its not so easy to spot it compared to the Starbucks and Tim Hortons nearby.

Interior
Clean and bathroom is clean. 

Negatives
The environmental impact of all the disposable plastic gloves and plastic bags of subways adds up. Everybody all of us need to protect the planet and companies should be mindful of the environment and our future generation. Therefore more effort is needed from subway to reduce plastic usage."}
{"text":"This location has the worst employees I have seen at any Subway location ever. They all seem super bummed out to be there and waiting on their next break. Not very pleasant or friendly. I keep going back since I work right next door, and plus, Subway is always a good easy lunch no matter what location."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this subway ever! First I asked about the 5 dollar foot long as to was it not offered there,  due to being in front of the outlet mall or are they not offering it the girl laughed and replied i guess both. My bread was dry and crumbly, the meat which was cold cut combo had no flavor like the meat had been frozen. I even tried taking off all the toppings to see if that was just hiding the meat flavor and that was not it. This is my first bad experience at subway, and hopefully my last. I will just choose another location next time i am wanting a sub sandwich."}
{"text":"I go here frequently because it is close to my work and the service is always really good. I'm always greeted with enthusiasm and with a smile. They are always really quick even when they are swamped and that is quite often in my experiences. The employees are fantastic and seem to enjoy their jobs!!"}
{"text":"I love this subway location....close to home and always fresh! I've enjoyed most sandwiches from this location. The staff is usually nice but tend to be a bit slow. But it's no big deal.  

I also like getting a $5 Footlong on occasion. The sandwich on special changes every month, so it allows you the chance to try something different or new at an affordable price. 

I'll be back...maybe even tonight!"}
{"text":"The employees are awesome, just like their Tuna Sandwich... MmmmmMmmMmmm...."}
{"text":"it's a subway, how could it be any different than every other subway? well, this location doesn't have egg salad and it doesn't have jalapeno cheese bread. on the plus side, the veggie patties are not kept frozen! i say this with an exclamation mark because most subways have so very few vegetarians that they keep the patties in the freezer. or maybe the vegetarians don't go to those other subways because they don't want to be reminded that everything is freshly frozen and freshly thawed, so you're not really eating \"fresh\" in terms of any of the regular meat or the fake meat (how could it be fresh, anyway?). the service here was fantastic - they didn't even look at me sideways when i requested more spinach and jalapenos."}
{"text":"This is just one of those times when I couldn't wait to get home and eat.  I workout at the GoodLife in the area and this is right across the parking lot.  Everyone has been to Subway so I don't need to get into the food.  This establishment has a bunch of kids running the show so be aware.  There were 3 employees in the building and the two boys made the girl make all the sandwiches for the lineup of 5 people while they twiddled their thumbs...lol."}
{"text":"Service is unfriendly even though I was the only customer in the store.
I ordered the wrap as usual.And they were generous on the vegetables (didn't expect she grabbed a handful of each) but very careless when making it. 
My wrap was very broken, sauce was everywhere when I open it, so I had to eat it with a fork. 
Tips: 
Maybe don't order wrap"}
{"text":"Always the same guy working here. He's super friendly and knows a thing or two about making subs. 

Food: 4/5 As good as any other subway. 
Service: 5/5 Friendly and knows the subs really well. 
Environment: 4/5 Sometimes busy. Tables are clean.
Washrooms: 4/5 Fine.
Worth it?: 4/5 Great when you want a sub. 

I've come here several times over the years. Recently it's always the same guy working. He is not particularly fast but he puts a lot of care into the subs he makes. He must really know the menu well because he has recommendations for every sub. He recommended a sprinkle of grated Parmesan to top off a meatball maranera sub and it has been added to my go to sub. Some people may find it pushy but it's great service in my books. 

This is my favorite subways location now! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went to this Subway for lunch the other day and realized when I got to the register that I didn't have my debit card in my wallet! I didn't have any cash on me and the cashier was SO nice and understanding and let me take my sandwich and told me to come back and pay the next day.  When I came back we had a good laugh about the whole situation.  Top notch customer service right there! 

They are always friendly and accurate and keep the line moving during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"This place earns its one star, one the service sucks. The lady that owns it is rude and makes the owner workers miserable. Two they try to scam you for more money like not taking online coupons. The place isn't that bad food wise but the people suck."}
{"text":"this is one of the better subways, they tend to have a happy crew compared to other subways. its also right next to the college and cheaper then eating on campus. all the ingredients look well kept and the place is clean."}
{"text":"This my go-to location for Subway! I have never really had any issues while eating from here. The bread is always fresh and the vegetables, meats, cheese, etc... are always good as well. The staff is very friendly and timely. They handle the long lines really well! I usually pop in really quick during my lunch hour and my order is always completed in an adequate amount of time -- 

I recently discovered the pizzas from Subway! They are actually very good! if you have a craving for a quick slice of pizza, order the individual pizza. I love the fact that it is customizable and not pre-made like if you went to little caesar's, etc... 

I definitely recommend this location. Keep up the great work --"}
{"text":"Ugh, there are good subway locations, and bad subway locations. This is one of the bad ones. 

In a rush, ordered a basic sandwich and and the guy serving me put toppings on that were clearly past their best before date (limp peppers, brown lettuce, etc.) Gross. 

You're down town, walk a couple extra blocks and hit up a different subway sandwich location."}
{"text":"24 hours so open for the late night munchies, however, it doesn't honor any Subway promotions or coupons so, your $5 foot long will cost around $12 bucks."}
{"text":"Now... I don't normally leave reviews... Especially for a place like Subway. But they helped commit fraud so people need to know. If you are going to leave a store with no manager make sure the assistant manager isn't a complete idiot. She barely spoke English and having found that my card had been stolen and used there I was wondering how they could not check the ID of the man who stole the card. If a card says Crystal on it and you are looking at a 40 year old man you think you would stop and say hm...This probably isn't right. THEN to let him place the order TWICE. When I called I got a woman who was so useless, couldn't speak english (don't care if you struggle with the language at least try) She didn't make any sense and if it was english, she wasn't trying very hard. I explained that my card had been stolen AND used at their store. I knew because I was able to get into their security system and watched it happen. I was happy to finally see that YES my card was stolen, my physical card, and NO they did not check when a man who was clearly not a Crystal used it again... not once... but twice... I know it is a Subway and you don't need a lot of brains to work there. I used to work at one in highschool I would know.... The manager staff should never leave their staff unattended especially if they can't even do a simple job of saying 'Can I see your ID'."}
{"text":"This is an older Subway but probably one of the most efficient Subway's ever. If you go here during lunch rush don't let the long line fool ya; they will move 10 people in less than 10 minutes. The employees are always friendly and reminding you of different promotions they have going on. Most of all they've always rang me up correctly even when it's chaotic- my wallet thanks them. Although I know prefer Jimmy Johns this particular Subway can still get my money when I don't feel like driving the extra way for Jimmy's!"}
{"text":"I normally hate Subway, they are all the same. It's a quick meal when you're desperate and is never my first choice. I don't know why we chose Subway tonight but I'm glad we did because this is the best Subway I've honestly ever had. The roast beef if normally all brown and dry. This was the reddest and most tasty roast beef from a Subway, very happy with our random choice for dinner tonight!! Will definitely continue to order there :)"}
{"text":"First of all, the map doesn't or can't identify this place correctly. It is, as the ADDRESS states, in the Kenilworth Shopping Ct (Harris Teeter location). What keeps me coming back to a food chain place is if is kept clean! This is the cleanest subway I have been to so far. In addition, you know how you watch those food commercials and they make the burgers or sandwiches so perfect, and you think \"My food never looks like that!!\" Well this subway is commercial-like, both in presentation and service."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken breast sandwich, when I got home, Dahn Moses gave me the Turkey, lettuce and mayo sandwich that the girl ordered behind me. I drove back and told them of the mistake, and no one apologized. Dahn made me a sandwich, again, not changing gloves, and I didn't get a refund. She was rude and I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I have ordered online a few time with there App. Every time I do my order is correct and ready when I pick up. Great job! They also  have outstanding customer service!"}
{"text":"Although its in a run down neighborhood, I found this establishment to be quite nice. I just got a soda, but the staff was very friendly. In fact even the patrons were friendly, one gentleman yielded some seats for us ladies. Also, I noticed that they regularly mopped and cleaned. So both the floors and the tables were immaculate."}
{"text":"Always great service!! They are super friendly at this Subway and efficient!! 
The subs are always great!!
I am currently taking advantage of their daily special!! :) such great value for the bucks!! :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Subway restaurants and this is one of the cleanest I've seen.  The food is always fresh and the staff is courteous & friendly.   

I'm not just saying this as a first impression.  I've easily eaten here over 500 times.  

Hands down the best service out of any Subway restaurant I've been too."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and warm.  I had the eggwhite with shredded cheese & veggies on flat bread.   

For the age of the building the site was surprisingly clean.  

The coffee however may have been too clean, in that it appeared to have soap bubbles in it.   So much so I was too afraid to taste test it.

Also I was a tad disappointed that this site doesn't support avocado."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location 3 times a week since 2009.  In the last 12 months it has become aweful. NONE of the employees speak english.  They barely understand what you are trying to order,  only having 2 people working there really slows down the service since you have to repeat yourself many times... this location has gone from a 5/5 stars to 1 star."}
{"text":"It's a Subway. The food is OK, as the Subway food is - consistent with other places. This outlet enjoys a great location and little competition in terms of food places, so they are often busy and usually don't honour any daily Subway specials - seems like they don't have to since they know they're so busy anyway.

Due to lack of options I do eat here once in a while though."}
{"text":"I dont know why they have a drive thru if they really dont care about it walk in come first i guess you will hear a !! I will be with you as when i can\"\"  helloooo you guys need an xtra person...."}
{"text":"The WORST customer service in town right here. This blond girl was so rude when I was trying to give my order I had to walk away.  Please don't waste your time with eating at this subway. I'm hoping a firehouse sub opens here soon. They know customer service!"}
{"text":"Seems to be limited supplies. I ordered a chicken parmigiana (new sandwich advertised in store), get to the end after dressing it, and am told there is no tomato sauce (despite it being advertised with the sauce - pretty standard chicken parma staple). The lady tried telling me it came with their \"BBQ sauce\". Um, no. Also they have no green olives and skimped on toppings. I'll stick to the subway at Church and Shuter from here on in."}
{"text":"Very nice, helpful employees. Clean, fast, friendly! Love this new Subway! Young lady who made our subs (meatball with pep & cold cut) was extremely friendly and helpful with a nice sense of humor, I believe her name was Caitlyn. This was the 2nd time we visited this new subway and we have yet to be disappointed. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We came in like 15 minutes before they closed and Dakota made our sandwich and she was awesome and upbeat the whole time. I know what it's like to have people come in close to closing time but she was smiling and talking to us and it made for a nice visit. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago and there was a new guy who had a really difficult time putting my sandwich together. Every single aspect of it...(it's a sandwich wtf). They said he was new and he would shout back at me and the employees \"I'M NOT NEW\". Unfortunately he's been there the last few times I've stopped in on my lunch break from work, and not only does he make me super uncomfortable, but my sandwich sucks. Once again...it's a subway sandwich?!?! Kinda hard to mess up."}
{"text":"I like Subway but this one was not so good.  When I entered the store it had a bad smell like sewer problems  but since I was taking out, I went ahead anyway.  I ordered a BLT asking the bacon be cooked but not the bread.  The young man put the bacon in the oven then asked what I wanted on the sandwich.  I asked for lettuce, lots of onions and mayo. He loaded the bun with the lettuce and onion, removed the bacon from the oven and without draining or wiping away the grease laid it on top of the sandwich. He then squirted mayo across the top of the bacon and cut it half and wrapped it.  So now I have a sandwich with bacon and mayo on the cut side and lettuce and onions in the back half.  I got home and reconstructed the sandwich.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I love this Subway.  I stop on the way to work, pick up a foot long and have half for breakfast and the other half for lunch. They always get my order right and are more than generous.  These people are great at 6 a.m.  Always friendly, joking and I just love everything about this place."}
{"text":"I came in 10 minutes to close and the staff was terribly rude, the guy behind the counter said \"f you\" under his breath like 5 times,  and the girl behind the counter wasn't helping at all. 
Terrible service"}
{"text":"Twenty-four hour location in Providence.  Super friendly sandwich artists are ready to make a multitude of different options for you.  It's a great option on those nights when you really don't feel like cooking anything.  Blink...and you might miss it.  But once you know it's there, you'll find you don't have to travel far to fill our belly or the belly of others with all that Subway has to offer."}
{"text":"So I ordered a foot long they charged me for 2 6 inch subs !!! Insead of correcting it the girl ( who i would name but she wasn't wearing a name tag ) proceeded  to cuss at us and get really rude!!!   Someone by the name heather come out and helped us out and was very polite and nice and not only did she fix it but remade my now cold sub !!! Thank heather for your kindness"}
{"text":"This one is closer to my work but I may just start going to the further one. The employees are nice but they have too much personal discussion whilst helping customers. This was the worst I've experienced though. As I'm waiting for them to finish up the employees were talking about wether the one employee (nicki) was sick or not. She was claiming it was her allergies and then proceeded to wipe her nose. This was the employee that just made my sandwich...allergies or not this is unacceptable. I truly didn't understand how she wasn't embarrassed to say/do something like that after just making someone else's food. She's very nice, most of the employees are but that's just plain disgusting. Kind of my final straw with this location."}
{"text":"I have gone here twice in the last year. The first time I got a meat ball sub with onions on Italian Bread. 4 hours later I came down with food poisoning. A day ago I went again just to give it a 2nd chance, I mean what are the odds right? Apparently they weren't in my favor. I ordered the same thing. I should have known when I took the first bite something was wrong because the meatballs were basically cold. I heated it up in the microwave and choked it down. It was mostly cheese not much sauce. I ended up throwing out the other half. I woke up at 2am with food poisoning AGAIN! I tried calling them but no one answered. Never again. I don't even think I can look at a Subway sign without feeling like I want to throw up. I'm sure they aren't all like this but 2 times in one year at this same location, that's ridiculous. I'm done."}
{"text":"This Subway has gone way down from when I first started coming here. I come here often because it is directly across the street from my job. Today 11/14/17 I came in to no one at the counter. They set a little bell on top to ring so I rang the bell. I still waited at least 5 minutes before anyone came out from the back. When they did come out it was two girls one got started on making my sandwich. I asked for a small soup and when checking out she asked if I wanted a spoon. Yes please. She comes back with a fork. Sorry we don't have spoons. You don't have spoons to eat soup? No sorry. I ask for a cup for water. She gives me the cup but fails to tell me that their water spout is broken. I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and nice when i came here and there was plenty of seating available.  Great quick meal while you wait for your oil change next door at jiffy lube."}
{"text":"Friendly, but stingy with everything. 

2 pickle slices?  Even when I asked for extra he only gave me 3. 

Same for all veggies.  

Even only gave 1 napkin

Good grief!"}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying, I like subway. It's cheap, it's healthy enough and it's quick. A nice fast food option in my opinion. 

This location however, I do not like. I work in the area so this place is convenient but I strongly dislike one of the regular staff.

He has this I don't want to be here attitude. He is quite rude, keeps you waiting just because he can. He even sneezed on my food unabashed the last time I was there (yes, seriously. I couldn't believe it either).

I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Guy was texting while helping me very unprofessional.  Who's training these knuckleheads"}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot when I'm at work. Affordable, fresh and healthier food options. My favorite is always the meatball marinara but my go to is the chicken breast sandwich with all the veggies!"}
{"text":"They need to move this location. It gets so busy and they are not the quickest. Very nice but you blow your entire lunch waiting in line. Be prepared to wait"}
{"text":"as others have said very rude, never once has anyone been friendly in this place, and the older gal who is mgr or owner is the worst"}
{"text":"This is your typical Subway in terms of taste and menu items offered.  I'm a pescatarian, so I usually go for the veggie delite or veggie patty sandwich.  This location is always clean and well maintained and the staff is friendly.  Their location is conveniently located in the plaza with Safeway in Estrella Mountain Ranch.  This is the perfect place for local residents to stop in after work if they aren't in the mood to cook.  Although Subway isn't necessarily super nutritious, the majority of the menu is probably healthier than the other nearby fast food options which are Macdonald's and Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Great subway!! They currently have an amazing young staff at this location, before people here were rude and slow!!  Plus, Elion offered superb and  professional service!!! 
This change has made me reconsider this location again, as it's super close and even offers the drive-thru option!!! Win-win! :)"}
{"text":"I typically don't Yelp about fast food restaurants, but this one really deserves the five star rating! I come here during my lunch break at least once a week, and the service is always super speedy. Whether there's a line of one or seven, they always seem to prepare the food and keep the line moving quickly. 

As far as the quality of the food goes, it's just like any other Subway. I do a 6\" tuna on wheat, and it's always made exactly how I like it! It's MUCH faster than others locations I've visited. I will definitely continue to eat at this location :)"}
{"text":"Very clean. Hospitable owner. Very nice. One of the best subways I've ever had the pleasure to visit."}
{"text":"Let's just say I will NEVER go to this or any other SUBWAY ever again. Basically, an employee of Subway harassed my boyfriend to where he felt like a hobo or just simply profiled. When I approached the man about it, he was aggressive and rude! My biggest complaint with him was with the insult he said as the disagreement was coming to an end \"you guys need to leave as you are harassing me. I need to get to REAL CUSTOMERS\". Mind you, I had bought food and was standing there with my combo in hand.
 There is a way to talk to customers who don't agree with you. At no point, were you to get caught up in a temper and throw that insult! 
To add to it, he is apparently the owner! He called me on the phone yesterday and argued with me for another 20-30 minutes. 
NEVER AGAIN will I go there and spend any of my company's money or my hard earned money for lunch/dinner. 
Customers beware! If you have a complaint, you can't do anything about it and Subway corp wont either!"}
{"text":"This is a new subway inside of Suncoast hotel and casino..... Great service and atmosphere. It's right next to the bagel cafe so you can't miss it. It seems like they are always busy being new to the hotel so they are always baking fresh bread. They have a nice seating area also, the only down side is that it's in a casino so they have inflated prices. This would be why they get a four star not five......"}
{"text":"If your going to be open till 10 don't put the food away till that time. Will not ever return!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for 20 minutes in line cause there is only one worker here today and it's lunchtime.  Not sure why thy would only have 1 worker.  This facility also said it is open 24 hours a day which is hard to understand.  Maybe they spread out the workers but this is kind of a high traffic location.  Silly."}
{"text":"Had a quick weekday lunch here the other day. 

Staff was quick and efficient. Store was clean with 3 or 4 tables out front to use and food was solid. 

Can't really ask for much more."}
{"text":"Tried to use a coupon , buy one sub get the next of equal or lesser value free.  They wouldn't take the coupon because one sub was a foot long.  They wanted to treat the foot long as two six inch subs. 'The system won't take it'. No such restriction is on the coupon."}
{"text":"Once you get over the fact that this Subway is inside the gas station market,  you'll realize it's like any other Subway franchise. 

Workers are quick to respond to your order even during a lunch rush.

You can gas up and the Shell and pick up a footlong!"}
{"text":"Clean and friendly and fast.  I don't know what the problems were with the other reviews.  They took my coupon and were very flexible with my order."}
{"text":"Save yourself the trouble and annoyance and go to Sam's Town..
 
Probably the worst customer service I have ever had. I came in on a Saturday a few weeks ago around lunchtime. There were two people working at the time, with about 3 people ahead of us in line. The girl working seemed stressed and overwhelmed with her orders while the guy just stood watching her, offering input every now and again, but mostly was just being obnoxious and cursing for no apparent reason.  
As the line moved painfully slow, we tried to keep patient as we watched the man working offer no assistance to the stressed woman. When it was our turn the man decided to stand over the woman and give her direction. It was at this point when I realized the girl must've been training. We ordered double meat on one of the meatballs and the man told her \"just dump them all in the middle\" and then when she did he began laughing hysterically. This man was directing this poor girl the wrong way on purpose for a joke that involved my f***ing lunch. I could not believe this was happening. After he was done laughing he told her the correct way to do it all while butchering my sandwich. 
We were the only customers in the shop at the time. As he continued making jokes and flirting with the girl another customer walked in. He stopped making his jokes and started washing his hands. When he finished, he started banging the paper towel dispenser as loud as he could getting the paper towels out and then proceeded to wash his hands again and repeating the banging process.
This guy could not have been more obnoxious with everything he did. I couldn't believe the lack of professionalism. I get it, you make sandwiches for a living making minimum wage, but that doesn't mean you have to be a complete ass****.  When we were finally almost out, we noticed the bill was too high. She had overcharged us.. UHG... 
I couldn't get out of this place fast enough. If I wasn't in such a hurry I would've confronted him. If I ever go back there it will only be to see if that idiot is working so I could file a formal complaint."}
{"text":"The coffee shop was closed next door and the owners saw me looking sad.  It was the afternoon, and they made a fresh pot of coffee just for me.  No one has been that nice to me in ages.

I should mention that they're very fast during the lunch hour. Just a ps."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible, there were flies buzzing around the food that even the girl making the sandwich had to act like she didn't see, I even had another employee tell me not to eat the meatballs because it had been out a couple hours when the girl working with him had just served it to somebody else. incredibly not okay. Go to the one up the street, better service and quality."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite Subways to go to. Especially since it shares its space with a winchells. Every time I go when I see Savannah I know my order is gonna be perfect. Definitely my personal favorite here. Absolutely no complaints other than I wish my favorite chips were in more often but otherwise super happy with the customer service!"}
{"text":"Ever since the management changed, quality has been 100 times better. The employees are super nice, and the food is even better. Glad to have a good subway right down the street from my house."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to get breakfast, and remembered seeing a commercial about the Subway breakfast sandwiches on flatbread. I decided to give one a try. 

This Subway is small, but clean. Staff was friendly. They greeted me and answered any questions I had. Had my food and was on my way in a short time. 

Paid $3.25 for an egg white, ham, and cheese sandwich plus a drink. It was good. Something different.

Will definitely stop again when in the area."}
{"text":"First time at this location. They have a smaller counter area than most, but service was quick. Person that rang up our order was friendly. Looked very clean. Will go there again."}
{"text":"They skimp out on a lot of ingredients here. Never enough meat, cheese, etc., but if you want lettuce or sauce, they'll give you tons of that. I've never had such a depressingly soggy footlong. I suggest you go to the Jimmy Johns a block away."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to go but I am disappointed that on a Sunday they had no meatballs, there was a 30 minute wait which wouldn't be a big deal but that is all my son will eat. you would think since they're having deals on the meatball that they would make extras and just be prepared to stock up on it. Other than that service was only decent. No smiles, no greeting."}
{"text":"Needed chow and needed it quick so I went to the home of the $5 foot long.

Fresh ingredients laid down on fresh baked bread.

This particular location is clean and the sandwich artists are friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty solid lunch. Everything was fresh and tasty. The guy who made my sandwich however was slow and even though I repeated what I wanted several times he forgot my green bell peppers."}
{"text":"If I could give it a -0. I would. Worst place! Don't go. They never have the food you want! Not fresh! One of the employees aggravated me. Been races. For no reason! Horrible employees! Slow! Always training employees due for the manager hiring the worst people!! Don't go! I don't recommend!"}
{"text":"It's Subway. So, I don't expect much outside of the sandwich itself. So the place is not a place for date night, OK? Well, maybe it'll do if you're a teenager or somethin'. I just go in, order my food, and leave. It's been a long time since I've eaten there and I remember being stressed about it. Nope, it's not the cleanest place around. It's Subway, people. So long as it's sanitary where they fix my food and clean in the bathrooms, I'll be back. Fast, fresh, friendly service gets this place 3 stars. If they offered more variety of chips and kept the tables wiped in a more timely fashion, they'd earn another star.

Bottom line: it's fresh bread, fresh toppings, fast service at a decent price"}
{"text":"Clean. Quick. Cool. Kind. Good.

Looks like a new location, though it probably isn't. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!

This is a rip off!

Not a typical subway!

Expensive!  More expensive than usual subways!

Jacked up prices!

Long lines to pay double or triple the usual subway bill.

I can find a thousand better and cheaper places in Vegas.  Even if plowed under, you could manage better!  There is a McDonalds next door that has typical McD's prices. Go there.

Stay away!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I want a fixin for a cheap sub so I went in and the girl tells me they are out of wheat bread, bummer. So I opted for the flatbread with chicken and provolone. When I got home, I started to smash and almost broke my tooth on the rock hard bread! Wont be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is definitely not the friendliest Subway that I have been to, I would really suggest some type of customer service etiquette to the employees.  I stopped by on 11/6/17 around 2pm and when I went to the counter to order my food, the employee just starred at me. I was never greeted and when I asked for my sub to be toasted, the girl was somewhat bothered by my request.  As I was adding my toppings, both employees were having a personal conversation and didn't care much for providing great service.  It was very obvious that both young ladies didn't care much to be working there."}
{"text":"Always friendly, they always greets you, clean, lots of tables, right next to SafeWay"}
{"text":"This place is very dirty, and their employees are incompetent and argumentative with customers. And for the record, We were not the customers they were arguing with... it was two different customers in line before us that were not even together."}
{"text":"Solid subway.  Good service!"}
{"text":"I got sick last time I ordered from them, I am not sure if the food wasn't fresh or if it's because it took so long to get the food."}
{"text":"The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldn't remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didn't get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, \"ok, time out! I'm the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues.\". They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn't order it, and after telling the girl, she said, \"I thought you said...\". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!"}
{"text":"Was just there... I am soooo dissapointed... The guy told me HIS owner does NOT accept coupons!!! Well this message is for the owner... reality check the other 5 subways 2 minutes away from you... DO!!!! So you just lost business from A Lot of people!!! I am definately not coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I ask for extra olives they put 5 total olives on my sub... And I asked how much do chips cost and they just added it without telling me.... Bogus"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Chicken was cold. Sub was suppose to be toasted and was just barley warmed up. Did not apologize for the cold food and just threw it in the microwave instead of the toaster. Would not recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"Prompt friendly service, well kept clean shop. The standard ingredients always look fresh here. Convenient to the light rail stop and Big Sticks Cigars."}
{"text":"Well I don't know what Subway these reviewers were talking about... But surely it can't be the Subway I love. The woman (whose name escapes me, though I believe it starts with a D) always greets me with a smile. I used to go quite often (budgeting =less eating out) and always got my food promptly and correctly. A little patience goes a long way people. Making a hundred different sandwiches a day and trying to get every order correct is a little difficult especially when there's screaming children and upset customers in the store. So give them some slack I work across the street and couldn't be happier going every day for lunch."}
{"text":"We prefer Jersey Mike's and other delis for subs, but this Subway is nearby and very convenient so we frequent on occasion.  Compared to other Subway's we've been to, I'll say this one is one of the best. 

The employees always greet when we walk in, regardless of how busy it is.  Even with a line, they have great customer service, act as a team to get customers taken care of quickly.

We've found the food to be put together nicely and haven't been disappointed (knock on wood).  Store is clean, behind the counters as well.  Employees look neat and friendly.

There is a comfortable amount of seating inside and out.  Our Subway has extended serving hours.

Subway is NOT our favorite franchise to get a sub, however, we enjoy when we do decide to pop in for a quick lunch or easy dinner for our kids....MUCH better alternative then a fast food joint like Sonic or McDonalds (in my opinion)."}
{"text":"Will NEVER eat at this Subway again. For Veterans day this Subway was participating in giving a veteran a free meal (free sub)

However two employees of this location loudly announced to several customers in their store that active duty military, were not veterans and would not get their free sub. Needless to say everyone walked out.

Way to go Subway, sorry my husband went to afghanistan and iraq to protect your freedom, but since he's still serving after TWENTY ONE YEARS.. he's not a veteran? wow.. subway.. just WOW. 

Forget the sandwich, you just insulted my husband and every other military service member who is currently serving's career. Shame on you.

I must mention however, this does not reflect on any other Subway, just this one narrow minded one. Dont go here."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's close to my home. I could walk there if I wrapped my head around it,,,but that ain't happenin'. They are friendly, quick and clean. They can answer my questions about the fat and calories, when I'm too lazy to read the sign that's right in front of me, without being openly irritated. They are built for lazy people...I like that. Plus, they aren't stingy with the veggies...I like that too."}
{"text":"Great customer service for a subway! Shoutout to Elijah who's a great employee and great personality! Thanks for helping out this golf team visitng from SoCal!"}
{"text":"It's like they literally count out two pieces of each topping (ex. onions, pickles, etc) for your sandwich. Very greedy with the toppings here, as well as the meat. I asked for a tuna sandwich and was given two HALF scoops instead of two full scoops. When I said something, I was given another half scoop.

Also, don't ask a customer if you can sweep under them while they are eating. That is incredibly rude and very poor customer service. Your sweeping can wait until I finish my lunch."}
{"text":"I didn't even order the guy at the counter was so rude...lucky its subway so it doest really affect them"}
{"text":"Ruby was extremely helpful and answered all my questions regarding the sandwiches. She was also very patient with our order."}
{"text":"I am giving this Subway a 5-Star rating based on the experience that I had here based on the staff and the cleanliness of the store. These guys and gals on staff do a great job of taking care of the lunch rush and making sure everyone gets through the line within a reasonable amount of time. This is greatly appreciated by someone who has a strict 45 minutes lunch break.

A lot of people have said some pretty terrible things about this shopping center and this Subway in particular, but I think they are a little extreme. It is true that this Subway is located in a rougher part of town, but I have never been harassed in the parking lot by beggars on my way in and out of Subway. If it is something that you are that worried about I would suggest parking right next to the door. The store itself has always been very clean. Subway management does a pretty good job of making sure the back rooms and the dining area remain well attended to.

For a Subway, this place isn't all bad. It is a quick, cheap, and friendly way to grab lunch on the go."}
{"text":"I go there about twice a week to order sandwiches from my family for dinner. There's a young girl with dark hair that works there in the afternoons and evenings. And each and every time I order she messes up my order completely!! I just wanted to sub sandwiches and she mixed up the orders so bad that she even missed half of the ingredients that I asked for and I specifically made her repeat to me what she was putting on them and she still messed them up!! I go through the drive-through because I have kids and it's hard for me to unload two kids and go into the store. This happens every single time she does my order fortunately I can't see at the drive-through window to see who is taking my order. I guess I'll just have to check my sandwiches before I leave from now on! It's so frustrating

It os NOT Eileen, she makes awesome subs and offers great customer service."}
{"text":"Same guy is working every time I'm there. ...asks me at least 3 times what my sandwich is and then 2 more times when he's ringing me up.  This happens EVERY time! Same for the customers ahead or behind me. Annoying, but not a deal breaker. But today, I see this guy try to pocket money from the customer in front of me. After making his 2 subs he asked what his order was, rung him up, opened cash drawer, got change and gave it to the man.  Then the guy asked for his receipt after waiting a moment...subway guy asks him again what his 2 subs were, rings it up again, grabs the guys money, which he had put under the cash drawer (not inside)....counts the money the customer gave him then says \"oh and I already gave u ur change\", and then prints receipt. Thank goodness the guy asked for his receipt! I think he may have been getting a funny feeling about this guy too! Needless to say.. I paid with a card and got my receipt!"}
{"text":"We ordered Subway catering online through this location. The ordering process was great, we paid online and got a confirmation via email with our choice of pickup times.  Our sandwiches were ready when promised and looked and tasted great!  We would do this again for an event, especially through the online ordering process."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of it. But my boyfriend love it. 

Healthy is all I can say. I will give 5 stars."}
{"text":"i luv subway.  but, because of the servers attitude, i'll never ever come to this particular one... i am livid, just cause his attitude was very unappealing. i've never bern treated so poorly! las vegas is supposed to b memorable. i will definitely remember \"not\" to come back to this one! he was nonchalant, not helpful, not informative. i feel like he didnt want to take our order, at all!  bad experience. he's dampened my mood!"}
{"text":"Ok great customer service and super friendly .  Fresh subs if you like them hot or cold . Great prices . The store is clean and the moment you walk in  Davids saids hello . 

As a general manager of fast food I know great service and he is awesome will definitely  be back !!!"}
{"text":"best breakfast subs than any other subway because they actually fry the eggs on the spot. never a line here and the food is regular price... none of the typical Vegas mark ups."}
{"text":"I'd say as Subway's go, this one is average. How good or bad your sub is really depends on the luck-of-the-draw on your \"sandwich artist.\"  There are times you get a 4 1/2\" sub which is mainly lettuce, and other times its 6 1/2\" with an actual filling.  I will say that I've also been there on several occasions where there ingredients looked less than \"fresh.\"  Like wilted lettuce and black guacamole.  But then again, what do expect for $3?  If you want Ruths Chris, its not far away."}
{"text":"So I look at their website to see what sandwich I want and see a tasty looking Steak & Cheese that I decide to give a try. It shows it loaded with meat and cheese and looks great. My wife goes and gets our sandwiches and I open up the wrapper and all I can see is bread. It looks like they didn't even cut the bread as all ends of the bread are sealed. I tell my wife \"they gave you just a loaf of bread\" and she comes over to investigate. She pulls at the bread and what do you know, it pry's open and there is one little piece of meat stretched down the length of the bread with a half slice of cheese covering it. I was PISSED.

How the hell do they get away with this? My sandwich was the size of a hot dog bun with less meat then you'd get with a hot dog.

I'm going to drive a bit further and go to a different location from now on."}
{"text":"I have to give this location a good review too.  I am not a big eater of subs and I hate nothing more than ordering a sub and then being asked 'what do you want on it'.  I ordered an Italian sub, put the Italian stuff on it.  Most subways are staffed with stoners or toothless ex-cons and I don't have the patience to deal with those folks.  The people here never fail to please.  I'd give the place five stars but the quality of the food itself is pretty questionable."}
{"text":"If i can give this place no stars i would, the employees are horrible, i was waiting in line for over 20 mins because there was people in front of me (Which i am not upset about) I'm writing this review because she skipped me and went to the woman behind me to get her order and not mine.. and also there was very ugly graphic rap music playing in the store with filthy words. I wouldn't take your kids here."}
{"text":"LUNCH TIME SPOT. Come here quite often if I forget my lunch. The staff is always friendly, fast and polite. The owner? sometimes works behind the counter as well. Never really waited in line for my order to be taken. They always have everything in stock. 

IDK why people are complaining about the drive through.Don't be lazy, get out of your car, walk in and watch them make your sandwich. Then you'll know it is right...."}
{"text":"Pretty friendly staff at this Subway and the food is served in convenient dine-in baskets.  Definitely more appealing than the other stores around this area."}
{"text":"Brand new Subway store opened just a week or so ago!  Very convenient in the Fry's Superstition Springs shopping complex."}
{"text":"This store is now under new management and the crew has been completely changed out.  Customer service is much better as the new manager is an ex-Marine and runs a really tight ship."}
{"text":"just another subway spot.  not exactly the cleanest one i've ever seen either.  subway is cheap though and you know what you're going to get everytime."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant these guys are better than average. I think they know that being in the middle of 3 Golf retirement communities means better than average service is expected and better than average freshness of the food is required. I've never been there and seen the bottom of a barrel or any dried out food that had obviously been out in the open too long.
If your in the mood for subway these guys are great, attentive and fast. You won't regret your choice of sandwich at this Store.
We go to this store at least once a week and over a 3 year time period haven't been disappointed even once."}
{"text":"Stopped in for their mixed salads to go. Did you know you can turn any sandwich into a salad? Awesome option if you are not eating bread or want a change from their subs (which are good).  Ivan made my salads and was super friendly even if they had a large order to fill right before lunch crowd. parking lot can get crowded during lunch time, so be patient ."}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow. Just spent my entire lunch waiting on one sandwich. The lady at the check out was having difficulty ringing people up and needed help from younger girl Maria who would not get off talking on her cell phone to help. Literally called her over 5 separate occasions to get help with ONE customer. Then once they sort of figured it out, they had to start over because it apparently go through. I had to walk out without my food and almost was late to work. THANKS SUBWAY. Not going there ever again"}
{"text":"The freshest thing at this Subway are the bags of Dorito's. The bread is always hard. I'm surprised they haven't been booted out of this shopping center. I have been going to this subway off and on for 10 plus years. It's hit and miss. Lately, it's all miss. I stopped going a few years ago because it was just plain awful. But started going back about once every couple weeks because it's convenient to work. The biggest problem I encounter with not only this location but another one closer to home is the BREAD. Often I will get bread that is stale and hardening. That was the case today at the Park Rd location. You'd think the employee would notice when they cut it. Maybe they do, and just hope you'll be alright with it. I was not alright with it today. I took the sandwich back. I can let a lot of things slide when dining out, but stale bread will never fly. Subway advertises \"fresh\" bread. Sure, everything is fresh when its made. Getting to eat it fresh is a challenge. In defense of this particular subway, they were kind enough to give me a coupon for a freebie."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow and if you're in a rush during the lunch hour I wouldn't suggest going there."}
{"text":"spotlessy clean, friendly Subway location hidden inside The Natatorium, which is the town fitness center.,The Subway is accessible to the public. Plenty of seating in an attractive skylit area.."}
{"text":"Great service, fast and the whole lobby was clean.  I ordered a Turkey Sub and everything was fresh it was nice having fresh ice tea."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of going back to this subway after a previous bad experience. I asked for a chicken sub on a wrap, mind you there are signs on the front door and in the restaurant that say you can get any sub as a wrap. The store employee said no we don't do that. The manager said no. Told me to call some one if I didn't like it. Last time I came here I asked for a meat ball, the person said they were out and she wasn't making more  because it was 5pm. She said I should have got there earlier if I wanted that cause it's popular, but she's not making more for the next 4hours the store is open. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Unacceptable for a restaurant to not have a bathroom for a customer who paying for food. Asked for little lettuce as normally it's piled high. Well it was nonexistent in this case. And gave attitude when asked for more than 1 napkin."}
{"text":"2 jack asses making our sandwiches is all I remember about this experience."}
{"text":"Omg. First time in here and never going back. The family and I wanted to grab some sandwiches for lunch but had we known the service would be pretty darn awful, we would've gone elsewhere! 
First and foremost I noticed that the Caucasian girl who was making sandwiches completely ignored the fact that we were in line and started refilling the napkins! I mean, who does that when there is a line! Or at least tell us that someone will be right with us. The other girl, who looked Asian, was also doing something else and after a few minutes, finally asked if we had been helped. Obviously not since we were just standing there. So, she finally takes our order but I have never seen anyone move that slow before - from the cutting of the bread to the placing of the meat and cheese... and then we asked for another sandwich and again took forever just to cut the bread and place the meat. I've seen Port of Subs workers go faster and they cut their meats individually per order! I ask for light mayo and mustard for the 1st sandwich which every sandwich place I've gone to has meant \"not too much\" but apparently to her it meant \"lite\" so the sandwich was just doused with mayo and mustard! It was a lot! I was livid. I do want to point out how it was a bit odd that the Caucasian girl didn't help us but then right after the Asian girl started helping us, she helped the next person who was also Caucasian... hmmmm...  I don't know, kinda odd... anyway, this place had awful service and the sandwiches were not good. There goes $20 down the drain. And the pastrami gave me a bad stomachache. Go elsewhere if you want sandwiches. Definitely gonna opt to drive a lil further down for Port of Subs next time."}
{"text":"This is one of the friendliest Subway's I have visited. Every time I walk into this store I am always greeted. The people that work there seem to be happy and in good spirits which is a reflection of the management team. 

I know what your thinking....\"C'mon man its a Subway\", but this one seems to do a better job than its other franchises. I work in an area where there are 2 other Subway's and I always go to this one because of the friendly service."}
{"text":"I used to work here, and things were run terribly. I'm surprised nobody has ever gotten sick from the food, management condones changing the dates on expired product so it's common practice. Also the store constantly smells like sewage due to the pipes never being cleaned, who knows what's grown under those sinks."}
{"text":"Yeah. Subway. Blah Blah Blah.

They're all the same, right? Not always. This one sucked.

This location is somewhat close to my office. I thought I would pop in for the \"Anytober\" deal. Yeah, I got a $5 sandwich, but the bread was stale, the sandwich was lifeless, and the experience was...forgettable.

If I'm in the mood for a sandwich while I'm at work, I'd rather take my business to Capriotti's or Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"This is a nice Subway. It's clean (almost brand new) and isn't as scary as one of the previous reviews makes it seem.

In fact, it's my go-to Subway for lunch. The meat and vegetables are always fresh, and never \"off\". The bread is always fresh, and when they build the sandwich, it's not pathetic and lifeless. I've had some bad Subway experiences in the past at other locations.

Worth a shot if you are hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"I guess it's time to finally write this review, even though it's \"just another Subway\". Well, actually, it's not your typical Subway. 

This location is clean, friendly, and they never mess up my order. Usually when I go in and visit a \"sandwich artist\", they assume I want everything on my sandwich...like lettuce. I've been to some locations where they automatically pile on the shredded icebergs without my request. 

These guys are obedient. I usually prefer spinach.

I've also been so some Subways where the sandwiches are lifeless. These guys make a good one. 

Is Subway the best sandwich around? No, but it serves it's purpose and can be a convenient meal when I am on my way home from the gym

Eat fresh, bitches!"}
{"text":"I feel terrible for the absentee owner who's poor choice in staff is mismanaging their buisness and driving away customers.  I was in line for 18 minutes, I witnessed an employee take cash with gloves on and return to make a sandwich with the same gloves, and a staff member leave the sandwich making line to use the restroom(mid lunch rush) and return without washing his hands, to make sandwiches. After 18 minutes only 2 six inch subs had been completed and now 2 employees and 9 customers were watching 1 employee make 1 sandwich for an indecisive 6 year old. Would not recomend this Anthem location  to anyone. It probably has  the most Health Department Violations I've witnessed ever."}
{"text":"Shit location. Shit employees. Shit customer service.

No really I mean it. The employees all seem to be dead inside and are extremely rude regardless of the way you talk to them. This location is also extremely stingy on veggies. They barely give you any ingredients even on the VEGGIE SUB. Like that's just ridiculous and if you politely ask for more you will get a sigh or a rude response. Honestly the only reason why I ever went there in the past was because of convenience but enough is enough. Just stop going here and go to the location in Square One because they value customer service and actually use fresh ingredients instead of recycling week old lettuce."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a Winchell's while I was in the area, and figured I would hit this location before heading out on US 95 to Death Valley.  Thought I would try a breakfast sandwich and a donut.  As it turns out, this is a Winchell's/Subway combo, so this Winchell's didn't carry breakfast sandwiches, just the donuts, I guess because Subway already has their gross breakfast sandwiches.  Boo Subway, so I just got an apple donut (which was decent) before having to go elsewhere for more breakfast."}
{"text":"The new Italian Hero is not a Hero for lunch.
The 6 inch sandwich we purchased today was not worth the money it cost. It looks nothing like the commercial that advertises it."}
{"text":"This is a good location. I've never been to a Subway where the staff was friendlier. They really hook up a nice loaded sandwich and sometimes after hanging out downtown I like to stop here for a cold cut combo. No casino marks up here I got my cold cut combo for $5 plus tax. There is seating and the area was clean. I don't know what this Subway is doing so different but other locations could take a lesson because this is a great Subway!"}
{"text":"I'm glad Subway took over Quizno's because I wasn't a fan of that location. This Subway is open 24 hours. I came in just before 9 pm and ordered a Cold Cut Combo for $5 plus tax. I became nervous when the girl who took my order said she had to examine the meat first to see if it was still good because it had been sitting in the container for a while. WTF??? We all know Subway isn't known for slicing fresh meat or serving meat that is of good quality but come on! I was skeptical however everything looked fresh to me. I have to say... my sandwich was great. Nothing smelled funny and the sandwich looked great. I came back the next day for lunch and that sandwich was good too. Inside was clean and I really like the convenience of them being open 24 hours. Try the cookies they are actually good."}
{"text":"Not one of the better Subways I've been to. It is open 24 hours however they need more then 1 guy working. This guy seemed like it he knew nothing about the sandwiches or how to work the register right. it took almost 20 minutes to get a sandwich with only 1 person ahead of me. I had a cold cut combo and it was supposed to be $5 yet when I got to my car and looked at the receipt he charged me $5.25 instead. It's not like the extra quarter broke the bake it's just that the guy was lost. The fillings on my sub were great but the bread was crunchy and hard. I got some oatmeal cookies they were soft and good. I might give this Subway a shot at a later date since I shop at the nearby wally world and since they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"This is the best Subway in the area - hands down. The location has ample parking, is clean, and rarely too busy. Even durring the lunch rush, this place is efficient. Never do I crave a Subway, but when I want fast food & still desire to \"eat fresh\" this is my spot. 

Located in the Whole Foods shopping center on the South-East corner of Ray & the 101."}
{"text":"Nice people.  Quick service.  Okay subs."}
{"text":"This Subway is located just inside the Sam's Town Casino lobby. With super nice and friendly help. It was a Tuesday afternoon and not crowded so we were promptly waited on.

Hubby was in the mood for their meatball sub so I opted to share a foot long and ordered it on Italian bread toasted with provolone cheese. The sandwich artist asked if we would like that double meat and I politely accepted that offer for their $1.50. 

The sandwich was tasty, hot and very fresh. The bread was ever so perfectly toasted the cheese was had that perfect string to it when biting into it and pulling back on the bread. The sauce was plentiful and seasoned just right to accent the meatballs to make it all marry together with the sprinkles of parmesan cheese.  

This Subway is on the smaller size but very clean with your usual self serve chips and drink station and actually the cigarette smoke was to a minimum. Nice!!

We'll be back for sure since we are staying at the RV resort here at the property."}
{"text":"Me and my husband really like this location the workers here are very friendly compared to others. We were here the other night and it was our usual guy Christian working. It's always a pleasant experience with him. Even when it's busy he's fast and efficient with our order and is always friendly and polite. He always makes a beautiful salad. He convinced my husband to try a panini and we loved it! Thank You Christian!"}
{"text":"Got a ham sandwich here. They only gave me two pieces of ham. To my knowledge, four pieces of ham is the standard for a 6-inch sub across all Subways. 

Things people do for more profits. Smh.

Also agree with other reviewers that staff are rude."}
{"text":"Stop here to get subs on the way home from work frequently. Always receive good service and good food!"}
{"text":"Our other Subway, on the south side of town in the Target Plaza. Set up backwards from the one I usually go to, same Subway fare. Always good!"}
{"text":"Belinda was awesome!! Very friendly service and always great food!! 2 meatball subs and 1 Black Forest turkey breast sub, and cookies for dessert!!"}
{"text":"this subway somehow always makes me sick. i suggest not ordering anything there and making a sandwich at home."}
{"text":"I have been a six foot sub sandwich for the last five years from this subway for new years eve. I called to place my order on Tuesday Dec 29th. Was very specific about what I wanted and when and what time I was going to pick it up (Dec. 31 at 4:30 pm). Was also very clear that the girl had my name and phone number. On new years eve at 4:30 went to pick up the sandwich and they didn't have it. They made it for Wed the 30 instead and to top it off had the wrong phone number written down. I am disgusted because I bought $100 in subway gift cards to purchase the sandwich."}
{"text":"Handicap with a coupon is not welcome through the drive-thru I am handicapped and I normally do not order from Subway but I figured because I had a coupon I try them well when I got to the window the girl told me that if you have a coupon you need to come inside well needless to say I won't be using this Subway ever again the other thing is I ordered white bread on my Italian they did the white cheesy bread I did not order white cheesy bread I would have went back but in the drive thru it took forever"}
{"text":"...And then.... there was a Subway... that got it Right! 

As you can tell by previous posts I have been on a mission to see how bad a subway can get and I've been surprised by how bad some are.

This one is actually good.  I asked if they had buffalo chicken, they said now, BUT we can make it.. sweeeet!.   I asked for extra jalapenos and peppers and instead of giving me a blank stare trying to figure out what I said, they added a hand full of each.  Before the sandwich was wrapped up it actually looked good! .. with other Subways it looks like Ray Charles put the sandwich together and its just a mess when you open it up."}
{"text":"Overall it was a fine experience, order salad, get cup, pay for food, sit and eat.

It's a subway, what more do you want?   get your food, eat and leave.  

I ordered a salad and I'm trying to figure out when Subway deiced to make \"chopped\" salads instead of  the usual layered salads.  Its not bad, its not great, but basically  you get your ingredients in a large white bowl and they are bludgeoned to death with a slicing / chopping device and then put into the usual salad bowl and served to you.

Overall its ok, but i think if the salad were topped with olives, peppers, or something to be more presentable it would be better."}
{"text":"A very lousy subway. Charging $7 for the listed $5 sandwich. Wouldn't honor the listed price."}
{"text":"Friendly staff who are always prompt and get to your order quickly. Relatively slow so you never have to wait in line either"}
{"text":"The employees are just soooo friendly here. Today, there was one employee who actually smiled at me. Oh, and the bread sucks every time I get a sandwich. The bread doesn't taste fresh -almost stale."}
{"text":"Ordered a 1' cold cut sub. I handed the manager a 5.00 gift card first then 5.00 bill to cover the taxes. He hands back my gift card 
With 4.80 left on card. Omg. I didn't have time to argue."}
{"text":"This place doesn't participate in the special promotions named in their national ads.  

We asked for one of those $2, six inch sandwiches, and the person simply replied, \"Uhh, we don't do that..\"

No dice!"}
{"text":"Was looking for low cost breakfast options after walking my daughter to school- not much in the area and this is next to a Starbucks.  Usually I spend over $8 there, for a breakfast sandwich and low fat coffee option. I decided to try subway :) I figure at least I'll get a bigger sandwich out of it...
Awesome idea!!! I scored a 6\" bacon, egg, and cheese on wheat with seattles best coffee for $3!!! Made my day :D 
Also the staff was super friendly. Breakfast is served here until 11am :) thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Rude asz lady here at subway named Martha don't ever eat here if you're hungry she'll drive u nuts. :-)"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Subway I've ever been to.  Ordered to go...no napkins given. Bread was stale, SO stale! Ordered a veggie sub and the guy put 2 pickles, 3 olives, 1 green pepper....I had to ask him to put more of all, I mean....it's a $5 VEGGIE sub. I should have sprung for the poke bowl next door!!"}
{"text":"Signs says open 24/7. As I walked up to the door and tried to open it, it was locked. I tried to see if there was anybody inside, nope. The restaurant looks as if it is open, all the 24 hr signs are lit and ever the hours say 24/7, but no one can get in."}
{"text":"Whoa. The lunch rush here is no joke! 

I literally walked in to twelve people in front of me...so be  prepared to wait, but have no worries; they operate with military precision. The line moves quickly, there is no confusion or yelling and the staff does an excellent job with their customer service. 

Right off the bat, I was pleased to see more than four people behind the counter go accommodate the lunch rush. And to see that each was given a specific task. There was an order taker, a meat and cheese expert, a veggies topper and a cashier. Then there was even a runner filling up the (veggie and bread) stations and getting whatever anyone needed. Clearly, I made up all these titles but you get the idea. Everyone knew their role and it worked out so well for everyone (staff and customers)....especially during a busy lunch rush. 

I opted for their new $4, $5 or $6 lunch special where you get a 6 inch sub (tons of options) and drink. My sandwich was prepared correctly, plenty of fresh veggies just like I like and everyone was super nice, they made sure I had everything I needed before I left...including my cookies. Now, they didn't have the raspberry cheesecake, but substituting chocolate chip was just as good. 

I will definitely return to this Subway. Since it's such a fast, friendly and a healthy option."}
{"text":"Ugh....I hate to have to agree with the previous reviews but this place is not going to be at the top of my list of places to run back too for lunch. 

I went during lunch so the line was long and there were more than enough people behind the counter to have a productive assembly line to get us in and out...however they spent more time talking to themselves than helping us!

I finally made it up to the counter, ordered my sub. Here's where this visit went way downhill, when it was time to came to add my toppings the lady behind the counter made it seem like it was a bit of an inconvenience for her...like how dare I ask for lettuce and jalapeños?!?!?  UGH . O_o 


Eventually made it out, but I'm not running back to this location any time soon! 

OH, and this location did NOT have the raspberry cheesecake cookies!!!"}
{"text":"... i dont understand the hate on subway... flatbreads always a good choice and sub of the day for a cheap sub and mixed choices. Chill staff"}
{"text":"This location is now open 24 hours. I went in for a sandwich at around midnight and got EXCELLENT service. I know, I know, it's easy when you're the only customer in the store, but the worker (a younger asian guy) was truly cheerful and pleasant to talk to. The food was also fresh and the veggies didn't look like they'd been sitting around even though it was the middle of the night."}
{"text":"So, a footlong veggie is $6, plus $3 if you want a combo. Seriously, next time I come to Vegas I'm packing some meals! It was good, but I think for the price I'd rather have something else. At the time, this was the only option for quick breakfast."}
{"text":"My credit card number was lifted at this store recently and several hundred dollars of charges made that same evening a upscale stores in Henderson, NV.  Fortunately AX Fraud was on top of it and called me right away to determine if I was making the purchases.  I called the Subway to alert them and was told the Manager would call me back the next day.  Never heard a word from them.  So if you go here use cash or better yet drive on and do business with someone who cares."}
{"text":"I have been amazed once again by how horrible subway is. I keep wanting to give subway a chance because I remember when it used to be good. But by far this one has been the worst. they charge Waymore than all the other locations the person making the sandwich doesn't listen they don't give a crap. Overall very poor and bad experience will never return to this subway."}
{"text":"The food is fine just like any other Subway. But like every Subway it seems like they teach the staff to over charge or not offer the deals until you already pay full price. Its almost like a scam they started over charging more for less product. It is a corporate wide thing. Its so close to house is the reason i go but after having some kind of problem with the deals that they offer every time i'm going to just try something else."}
{"text":"I really like this location each time that I have visited they are fast and friendly. When I went in yesterday the worker pointed out I could get the daily foot long for 5 dollars rather than the 6 inch for 3.30. So I did. The place is very clean and orderly."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch online for our office today for lunch. The 2 salads had like zero lettuce...that's the cheapest indigent!! We requested no ham on the sandwich and guess what...there was ham!! We're sticking to port of subs from now on for company lunches!!!"}
{"text":"Love this location, I always have a good experience here . The employees are always friendly and they're never stingy with their chicken lol. The biggest complaint I've seen for this location is the lines. You may have to wait in line for a little bit but that's only because it's one of the only 24 hour subways in Mesa. If people were a little more patient I'm sure this location would have more better reviews!"}
{"text":"This location is awesome. I don't get the other negative reviews but I can honestly say I have never experienced any of that here. There has been a change in employees over time but that happens in a place like this. Too bad because the current girl working (name escapes me damn it) is effing awesome. When I walk in she greets me and asks if I am going to have a spicy italian or cold cut combo this time and it's cool she remembers. I like extra bell peppers and light lettuce on my sandwich which for some reason is hard to comprehend for some employees and other locations. This girl actually makes the sandwich how I ask for it and asks if it looks OK and if it needs more or less of anything. Sometimes this location gets super busy during lunch time and on weekends so they run out of certain types of bread at times but it is what it is. Solid location. A few times now I have been approached by people selling things or asking for donations. This isn't Subways fault. It's happening outside in the shopping center. The area is nice and newer and I hope they have security in the shopping center but if they do I haven't seen any. It would be nice if there were security making regular rounds to help with stuff."}
{"text":"This location just recently opened up. I've been by a couple of times now both inside and used the drive thru and have been happy with the service and food I have received. The people working are friendly and on my first visit they didn't even charge me for extra cheese. There's pros and cons to utilizing the drive thru here. Not having to get out of the car is convenient however you can't see the toppings in front of you and sometimes certain veggies don't look so fresh. It's nice they have the option either way and the drive thru is long so it can fit a good amount of cars. There's parking right outside Subway. Inside was clean and they did a good job wiping the prep areas before making each sandwich. All in all a nice addition to the shopping center even though my wife was hoping this was going to be a Starbucks as it was being built lol. There's also In n Out Burger and McD's nearby but it's nice to have an option for a cold or hot sandwich too so I'll be back."}
{"text":"I just have to give these guys a good word and somewhat of a mea culpa for stumbling in here (with my Uber driver, no less) after quite a few last weekend at about 2am.  The woman was nice enough to hear me out and make me exactly what I wanted- which included some pretty bizarre ingredient combinations.  Thanks a bunch....and it (of course) tasted great."}
{"text":"Never a problem here. Always friendly and quick with the service. Very polite and always kept nice and clean. The veggies are always fresh. Even when i come late at night after 11pm. So thats always a plus. Other than that. Its just another subway that happens to be 24hr and on the way home. Always great to \"Eat Fresh\". LoL"}
{"text":"I hate this subway. There is always an issue getting to the Drive Thur. They are slow and the food isn't as good as ones near it. I past them on my way home from work, but I back track and go to the one on Nellis & Lake Mead. Yes it's out the way but the drive Thur is amazing, and it's always good."}
{"text":"My local subway. Always is clean, like super clean. Every time I go in, I look at the little drink kiosk and I'm like \"woah, so clean\". Diana helped me this time and she was super nice, the other girl working didn't have a name tag and she seemed like she hated her job. There's nothing wrong with this place and I definitely don't think it deserves two stars. It's a normal, clean, nice subway."}
{"text":"While the people working at this Subway are very friendly and the service is good, it appears as though they are clearly instructed to majorly skimp out on the amount of ingredients going into the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. The staff almost seem pissed off about being there.  At no time did they greet any of the customers, nor did they even make eye contact. They answered questions with short 1-word answers. Their sandwich making was uneven (the lady in line before me ordered the exact same sandwich that I did and I noticed she got 7 slices of meat, while I only got 5). I do love eating at Subway but I certainly wont be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"3.9
They've got spinach at this location
The most elusive of subway ingredients
You get what you expect and what you ask for
24 hr sandwich shop and great price 
I get there was an increase which is rough(hence the 0.1 point deduction). Until you realize the previously more expensive ) sandwiches are now cheaper
That's a win"}
{"text":"I always have a good experience at this location. Even when it's packed at lunch time they get you in and out as quickly as possible. 

Service is always good. Everyone that works there seems to be happy and that they like their jobs. The ingredients are always fresh and tasty. There is even a small but, clean seating area if you want to dine in. 

My only complaint is how the parking lot is set up. There are two different entrances but, only one exit that is next to the drivethru line. If the drivethru is backed up then you have to either wait or go out of one of the entrances which can cause an accident."}
{"text":"Love that there is a subway on this side of surprise.

The staff is very helpful & Polite, and they are usually teenagers.  They are keeping this place clean and organized.  It is also usually a less busy location."}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE  the lunch Crew is amazing.. They even know my order when I come in and when I want to mix it up they make great suggestions based on my taste and always nail it. Love these guys."}
{"text":"I tried this place again....sorry I did.  I went there last night because husband wanted a footlong Subway tuna.  I decided that I wanted the carved turkey with avocado and half bacon...

The foot long tuna was good.  Happy husband.  Yay!

Not so much with me.  So I figure I'm ordering a footlong, so I should receive more than just 4 slices of turkey and 2 slices of Swiss cheese.  I asked for avocado which is an additional $1.50.  He put on 2 melon ball sized scoops for the whole sandwich and began to spread it.  I asked for bacon only on half.    The avocado was so thinly spread, I mentioned how all the other sandwich \"artists\"  use more than 2 small scoops on a foot long.  I asked if he was new.  

When he went to ring up the order, he way overcharged me.  It was like $23 for the 2 sandwiches.  I wanted a breakdown of the cost.

He had charged me 3.00 for avocado that was smeared so thinly, I wouldn't have tasted it on every bite.  And then he charged me 1.50 for bacon which was only on half of the sandwich.

He admitted overcharging me.  At this point, I knew my husband was wanting his sandwich and I didn't want to get ripped off.  I told the guy I only wanted the tuna.  He goes on to say, a footlong only comes with 2 small scoops.  I have been going to subway longer than he has been alive.  I told him he was the 1st one in 20 years to be so skimpy...like he owned the store or something.

Avoid this location at all costs.  Not only is this one sandwich artist a miser, but this place has homeless people outside loitering.  I had to politely ask several folks to move.  

The store is clean, but save your money and go to another location.  You won't get ripped off or overcharged."}
{"text":"I was here last week and the poor girl serving me had a long line, and she was the only one working. She was handling the stress well but gosh people get at least two employees working... Overall customer service would be better equaling more sales. Plus you'll probably have a bathroom break and a lunch break! Subway is time to think from the customer's point of view."}
{"text":"Excellent service, even though the store was closed the owner still opened up for us. The owner was really kind to me and my family. The store is very clean, good organization. The quality of the food is 5/5, extraordinary!"}
{"text":"Good food and customer service the way it was meant to be. JT and Malachi created a new type of sandwich for me and made me feel like I was on a movie set in the process. You can tell these guys love their job. Go here just for the experience."}
{"text":"Walked in here 5/9/16 at 8:30 and customer service was great by some young lady with glasses and some guy with a beard. This place was very clean and organized. To bad Jared Fogale fuck subway up."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Subway and would eat here 2x a day if I wasn't so frugal or the sandwiches weren't so full of sodium but this location is HORRIBLE! Not only are all the employees including the owner miserable but it has to be the thinnest weakest subs we've ever had. He gets veggie so w/o any meat you'd think they'd give him an appropriate amount of vegetables but they are so stingy you are lucky to get 3 tomato slices on a foot long.

For now on we only buy from Yonge/Eglinton when at work, they are great people lots of veggies or in Unionville at Hwy 7 where we've gone for years they have his sub memorized and are always generous with the toppings."}
{"text":"First visit at this location. Not sure what they are doing differently but this location just prepared the best subway sandwich I've ever had. Everything tasted fresh. The two ladies working today were funny and kind as well. Great experience altogether."}
{"text":"These two stars are only because of the great customer service the young lady displayed towards my son and his dad. This location did not have by meatballs, only white and wheat bread. They have sent out mailers recently for deals on subs so you'd think they'd be fully stock. Especially since the meatball is a special sub that's on sale. It wasn't the worker's fault I know but ordering or shift manager Manager need some polishing."}
{"text":"Ok here's the thing,  I have been to Subway's all over the southwest, part of me does this because its cheap, fast and somewhat healthy, and the other part just to see how much better or worse they can get.

I ordered the double meat chicken salad.. once again i'm mystified about the \"chopped\" part of the chopped salad.  please dont use some type of medieval torture device to mutilate the salad greens and ingredients. what happened to a nice layered salad the purchaser gets to mix up and destroy for themselves? 

It seems in this are that the language barrier is always a challenge, I understand people try, and this is fast food, but clear communication would make this a slightly smoother process.  Overall i cant complain too much since my order was correct.  The only thing that i think Subway should work on is their chicken and egg.. it appears the egg and egg white parts of sandwiches and wraps are pre-made and really not appetizing.. this also goes for the chicken that is pre-sliced, with \"grill marks\" and they are all the exact same size.   I know this isn't a store level thing, but step up will you Subway?"}
{"text":"Very, very dirty.  Fans and drink cooler have caked on dirt.  So gross...  Won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Now this is what a subway should be like, Raymond I can't say enough about him very helpful very nice guy. One of the cleanest locations I've ever seen , bins of vegetables and meat were filled to the top with very fresh looking meat and vegetables. He told me that his manager has very high standards and I really like that. Yes it is just fast food but when somebody goes out of their way to help you and be very friendly it does go along way in my book. They were very well-stocked have anything you could want even soup at 9:30 at night. Unfortunately this is almost a 10 mile drive for me passing 5 other locations but it looks like this is the subway I'm going to be continuing to visit."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely ridiculous. come on it's a subway restaurant the food is almost always the same not bad, good for a quick cheap bite to eat but this location is ridiculous this is the second time I've gone there and they have no meatballs how do you have something on the menu but never have it in stock like I said this is absolutely ridiculous. This location is right around the corner from my home but I won't be going back to this one again I'll drive the extra mile and a half 3 miles whatever it is to go to a subway that actually has meatballs. And the people working there don't even seem to care you walk in and ask for meatball sub and they tell you nope don't got it I mean come on. If you're open and you have something on the menu you should have it in stock I can see if this was once where they were just like oh my God we didn't prepare and we don't have enough but this is the second time. Just plain laziness don't wanna make any more don't want to have to clean it up at the end of the night."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY from this place. They were to busy cleaning an hour before they closed and refused to toast my sandwich tonight an italian BMT.  The young kids here don't care, the staff tonight should be fired. I won't be back and will tell all friends, family and co workers not to come here."}
{"text":"No changing table in the restroom? What?! I had to lay my baby down on the disgusting bathroom floor and change her diaper. What else was I supposed to do? Change her diaper in the dining room with everyone watching? It was during the busy lunch time rush, I was with my in laws, they parked the car way too far away and we had just gotten back from driving home from Tortilla Flats- it was the floor or wait another hour until we got back home. I had no choice but to kneel down on the floor and change her diaper on the ground. I was so thoroughly disgusted, I didn't even eat my lunch. The salad looked good, my husband loved his sandwich, my in laws were pleased with their food. Service was good, the employees were cheerful and respectful, it had the outward appearance of being a quality store- everything else was good.... except for the glaring fact that there is NO CHANGING TABLE FOR BABIES IN THE RESTROOM! Am I seriously the first person to ever walk through those doors with a young child still in diapers? I think not. That means other mothers have had to do what I did; Lay their child down on the DISGUSTING BATHROOM FLOOR and CHANGE THEIR DIAPER ON THE GROUND. This is beyond unacceptable."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience here the other night.  It was late and I was really hungry and I got full with delicious healthy food and wonderful (exceptional) customer services.  I said: make me your favorite sandwich; it is now my favorite.  They were two real pro sandwich inventors.  They are always open;  I am always hungry.  It is a win- win."}
{"text":"Worst Subway I've ever seen. Inside gas station, smelt like a dumpster, disinterested staff(1), ingredients looked rotten. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"They had one person working with 8 people in line.  C'mon, who the hell is managing this place? Staff appropriately so customers don't have to wait +20 minutes in line. No surprise this store has horrible ratings. How are they maintaining cleanliness standards with one person working by himself? Won't be surprised if the health department or labor board is eventually called on this Subway"}
{"text":"So what does having your register system updating have to do with making a sandwich. They can't make a sandwich will it's updating. Apparently not. Second time I've had bad service here."}
{"text":"The 3 ladies working were rude. They were having a conversation between another as if I wasn't trying to place an order. And probably the most expensive subway I have ever been to"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! same Mexican guy always working.. never says hello or goodbye just asks what you want in broken English. sooooooooo annoying!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and stopped here for lunch.   That was a mistake.  Extremely rude employees who seemed annoyed to make my sandwich.  Hey Subway, are you listening?  That is not how you treat customers if you want them to ever come back.  Smile and act like their order is the most important thing in the world.   
The sandwich SUCKED so much I ended up eating at Panda Express.  The produce was old and not fresh. The bread crumbled apart.  Maybe I got the leftovers from yesterday.  I should have known better when I heard the employee behind the counter sneeze...now I wish I would have been looking to see what direction he sneezed!!!
The good thing about this is I am visiting from out of town and I will not be back."}

Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3?

Ok. We all know how much I love a good sandwich. Nay, a great sandwich. And since a sandwich is God's invention meant JUST for me (and every other good boy and girl), it should be perfection.

Ladies and germs, I present Subway (or as I like to call it WrongWay). We've all had those moments in our lives where we go through phases (paisley shirts, the Beatles, and Ace of Base (still in it)), and Subway's $5 footlongs are no exception to that.

Today, I popped in to this location out of desperation because I didn't want the other option (KFC Double Down). My sandwich at this location was loose, limp and stale. And no one likes that combo. I had the Italian BMT.

The ingredients were fine (except the brownish/green tomatoes). But the sandwich as a whole, was unappetizing, and didn't have the fresh, crispness that I've come to expect from Capriotti's, Jimmy John's or hell, even Quiznos. 

Do yourself a favor. If you are in need of a stellar sandwich, and nothing is in sight, PLEASE go to the Walmart Neighborhood Market and pickup your own ingredients. Your own sandwich will taste better.

Also, if you are in this complex, pop in to Cheyenne Dental. They'll do a great job for you. Review on them in the coming weeks.

(faints on stage from weak sandwich)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick take out salad. It wasn't too busy for a work day lunch break. This Subway is easily the cleanest location with the most friendly staff.  Service was quick and accommodating. 
Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: 

I feel that it's only fair I do an update for this location since I've been back a few more times since my last review. 

I cant really give an update for the sandwiches or preparation because lately I've only been going for the cookies.  Okay, so I'm totally obsessed with their cookies. I admit it, but there are far worse things to be obsessed with...just saying! 

Anywho,  I'm bumping them up one star because the cookies are consistently delicious, they are always available (raspberry cheesecake is my favorite) and are super reasonably priced. 

Also, I have noticed a shift in the customer service...lately the staff has been very friendly. Hopefully, this will be their new norm...I'll keep my fingers crossed."}
{"text":"I don't even eat Subway as I am not a huge fan of the food in general. But my kids wanted to stop and get sandwiches, so we did. Tyler greeted us and provided such great customer service. My 13 year old daughter was like \"he's so nice, they should hire happy people like that to work everywhere\" and I agreed. He was enthusiastic, asked me how my day was going and was very efficient. Definitely great service!!!"}
{"text":"Always clean and great customer service no matter what time at night it is. Love that this place is open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it's the price here is much higher then other locations but it is by almost $2 more 
The footlong was almost empty when ask if the can add more the had this face like why are u asking me to do that and at the end I eat the bread with little bit vegetables inside I don't recommend coming here unless you hungry"}
{"text":"Before 10pm on Wednesday. They have no provolone cheese or yellow peppers. Not even up to par for a Subway outside the US."}
{"text":"Yesterday evening came to stop by subway after a long day of shopping just to buy some cookies handed them a 10 dollar bill they go in the back laughing amongst each other and came back to ask me if I have another bill that my $10 bill was fake! First off it wasn't! Second it was not rip nor tore! Third it didn't even look like it at all is what baffles
me. Told him to held it up in the light then he seen the strip and apologized but by than who in the right mind would still purchase so I grab my money and left. They even gave me the wrong corporate
number and called security talked to security and they said the same thing that the bill was not fake but the humiliation they really went to the extreme! Not profession at all and racist! I can't believe what had happen tonight.. ruined my night just because I wanted to go grab some cookies smh!"}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food has TValways been my experience with this subway, but today I was greeted with a smile and great customer service by Deanna. With large crowd and only a crew of 2 including herself Deanna managed to serve up a warm welcome good customer service and the best sandwich I've ever had there. Thank you for my new and satisfied experience."}
{"text":"Tropicana inside shell gas station.
My lunch started at 12:00pm I arrived at this location at 12:05pm I've been sitting inside my truck at the drive through for 20 minutes it is now 12:25pm this is the slowest most pathetic service I've ever encountered. I then decided to leave the drive thru park my truck go inside to find five people waiting in line and only one person making sandwiches what a joke I'll never go there again"}
{"text":"Customer service is a hit or miss here, but most of my experiences have been bad. I came here once and the employee didn't wash their hands before making my sandwich. Ew."}
{"text":"1. There was no one up front, but I did see a half roll of bread sitting out. The 3 girls working we in the back talking loudly, one finally came out and continued to yell into the back in order to carry on their conversation while ignoring me on my limited time lunch break.

2. I ordered a 6 inch, assuming I would get fresh bread from the Warmer, but the person decided to use the bread that had been sitting out.

3. My sandwich was put in the toaster, the girl went into the back again. The toaster began beeping, indicating it was done, but the girl stayed in the back.

4. She finally came out to continue the sandwich, I asked for 3 things: baby spinach, cucumbers, redwine vinegar. She asked me to repeat myself 3 times and while looking to her left and continuing her conversation I watched her sloppily slap together my sandwhich. 

5. I finally got to the register to pay, she could not, for some reason seem to stand there long enough for me to just complete my transaction and leave that awful place.

6. I paid $7 of my hard earned money for a sandwich that I unwrapped and looked like it had been stepped on, the bread was burnt, and the chicken didn't taste right, it was slimy. I forgot my lunch and I'm not exactly well off, $7 is a lot, but it's the cheapest place near by work, and I work 10 hour shifts so food is important ha. 

I worked in fast food before, I understand it's not a glamorous job, but there's a difference between having a bad day and just treating someone like garbage and not caring that the thing you are making is supposed to be the one thing they have to get them through a long day.

I want to note, I very gently held this sandwich and took it staight to the nearest table, carefully unwrapped it, and this is what I got."}
{"text":"Normally i don't do subway because there are better choices out there. Firehouse. Saw the ad on tv for the steak and cheese. Thought I would give it a try. Got there at 11.30. Asked for the steak sandwich. Said they didn't have any steak. Asked why at that time of day no steak. Stupid look and said he didn't know. Never again."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Subway I have ever gone to!! I went last night to get a sandwich on my way home from work. When I walked in I was not greeted or even acknowledged by the woman behind the counter. There was a solider in line in front of me that she was helping at a snails pace. While the sandwich was in the toaster Doris asked me what she could start for me while the sandwich was toasting. I had to tell her my order 4 times basically having to scream at her for her to hear me. It wasn't loud in there at all. She literally took forever to just slice the sandwich bread at which point the soldiers sandwich was done toasting and the oven was beeping. I told her to go ahead and finish helping her at which point she ignored me and just kept slowing making mine. Finally the beeping must have annoyed her because she stopped with mine and finished helping the solider which again she moved at a snails pace! I was literally in that Subway for 20 mins and there was only myself and the customer in front of me! That was the worst experience I have ever had!! My sandwich was disgusting, hardly any mayo and the meat had no flavor! I won't be going back there!!"}
{"text":"So this was one of the cleanest Subways I've ever been to. Cleanliness means a lot to me when I'm eating and sleeping, and this place surpassed the mark. There was a decent line when we walked in. However, the service was quick (we were on our way to a Pens game) and friendly for the most part. The woman who rang up our orders was not the friendliest, but you find this almost everywhere. When I need a quick, fresh meal before a game, I'll be sure to return to this Subway."}
{"text":"What happened price went up service got bad .real bad go in tonight at 8 pm told me ur ovens are off from the rainbow .wow place went down hill fast manager quit .I see she wasn't replaced .I'll save my money go else where"}
{"text":"Asian guy...stay off your damn cell phone when customers walk in.  Oh hey, owners, why not invest in another credit card machine that you can put BEHIND the counter for your drive thru.  Taking a customers card and reaching around the counter to use a customer facing credit card machine is really a bad idea.  I mean, I'm just a customer and I knew how stupid that looked to me.  Very unprofessional.  

Their organization when its busy is....well...non existent.  How can someone behind me get their sub made and check out before I'm asked what toppings I want???  I smell a new owner soon.  If Subway knew how this place was run, they'd probably shut it down.  Or at least consider some heavy reorganization and training."}
{"text":"Polite employees, but brutally slow service. There can be 4 employees working and only one person will be doing sandwiches. Needs better management."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them zero stars. The other reviews are spot on. They don't want your business. They refuse to honor Subway coupons. The employees act rude and condescending. Their prices are more expensive than other Subways in the area. I'd recommend the Subway at 51st and Olive if you're looking to eat at Subway in this neighborhood. Avoid this one at all costs!"}
{"text":"Awful!!!! The owner kicked out my 9 year old daughter because of her service dog. When my husband tried to explan she was a certified service dog he could care less! My poor daughter left in tears. When I called to complain he just berated me over the phone as well."}
{"text":"I guess I'm not eating here today! Apparently it's a cash only day =(  feel like they could post a sign on the door or tell you as part of the greeting."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad and the guy placed the turkey on the dirty counter without putting paper under it. Disgusting. I will not be back at this location. Thankful there are a lot of other lunch options downtown."}
{"text":"Dude, did you really turn to a co-worker and say, \"you take this order, I don't have the patience to wait for this\" while my 9-year-old was trying to tell you what he wanted on his sandwich? There were no other customers in the store at the time other than me and my children, so I'm not sure if you just woke up on the wrong side of the bed, or if you somehow mistakenly think that your job doesn't involve serving people no matter how long it takes to place the order.

Major customer service fail."}
{"text":"Its a normal subway.  Nothing special.  Although close to the interstate and open late, I don't know if its worth visiting as I've had political discussions with employees before that were unnecessary.  I don't care about your views, but if you choose to express them and you are wrong I will educate you.  After you are done touching my food that is.  This was a while back, so I don't even know if this employee is still around."}
{"text":"I purchase from this Subway often. The staff are very friendly and the food is fresh. The restaurant is always clean and well supplied. My only concern is although the prices are reasonable, I place the same order every time I visit but the price us different depending on the clerk who cashes me out. I guess there are different ways to put the order in. But it's not that much of a difference."}
{"text":"The sandwiches (my niece and I had) were both okay. The bread was a little stale but the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"In my opinion Subway is Subway is Subway. This location meets all the criteria for a middle of the road sandwich shop. 

Criteria includes but is not limited to, clean, fresh bread, well kept meats cheeses and vegetables. 

Parking is a bit fun depending on the time of the day, but if you can't find any out on the street you can pull into the inlet and flash those fabulous four ways and pop in and out. 

My only true issue with this shop is with Subway in general, it is funny that a place with such supposed healthy options there are very few vegetarian options. 

Bottom line...anytime I need a solid tuna or veggie patty I will definitely pop by."}
{"text":"I give this Subway location 5 stars because it's well deserved. Staff was friendly, fast service, and it was a clean location. Fernando was funny and had a great personality. I will definitely be coming here again. Thank you Fernando for the great service!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty standard Subway quality. The reason I am writing this review is because I have had 2 separate occasions where the female manager was very rude, loud, and unprofessional. I would also like to make a mention that there should be more training on cross contamination. I've seen veggies fall into meat products or meat into veggie trays and they just pull it out and throw it back in. Either way, its Subway and I still grab an occasional sub."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The staff are rude and as a local patron, I expected more. This establishment needs to look at the way they treat the people in the community. I've come here multiple times and have tried my best to overlook the brash nature of their employees, but today I had enough. I was talked to poorly and my the woman fixing my sandwich was so abrasive I had to walk out. I will be contacting corporate for the way I was treated and how my family have been treated repeatedly. You are sullying the Subway name"}
{"text":"Speaking only for chain restaurants, this Subway is pretty good.  They can make your sandwich the way you request and have chips the fountain machine stocked.  What more can you expect?"}
{"text":"Normally I get a veggie sub.  Today, since most every sub is $5, I had a foot long turkey breast sub.  

Really, you can't go wrong with Subway unless the bread is all stale or the meats are old.  But neither was old or bad.  It was good.

Turkey on honey oat with swiss.  Spinach, olives, jalapenos, banana peppers, and red onions.  Also sweet onion sauce and splcy mustard.  

Bomb....."}
{"text":"I just stood in line for 20 MINUTES and I was the first person in line waiting, 1 person ordering.... it was ridiculous. Maybe it's because I'm hungry and pregnant but 20 min for a 6\"  come on!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was good but the lettuce was nasty so I decided not to eat the lettuce there but other than that it was ok. But service was good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my service here tonight! Sara was a delight. Very cheerful despite working the night shift. I like this location more than the Gibson one!"}
{"text":"Subway is another of my attempts at finding fast food that isn't gross.
Do I love Subway, no. 
Do I go there when I have alternatives, no.
Do I frequent it for lunch during the school year, yes. 

In general I can get a very quick lunch there, which is all I have the time for. This is what works about Subway for me. If I could find a much better quick, delicious, and cheap place to find lunch near my work I would go there frequently.

Until then, I unfortunately must frequent Subway on a regular basis during my work days....."}
{"text":"Food is consistent subway quality  here. Clean and fast. I especially like this location because it does seem really clean."}
{"text":"Subway is my go-to healthy option! 

This location met all my expectations! The service was fast and efficient. Their selection of veggies was full and fresh. And most important my sandwich was prepared as requested and delicious! Just a quick note: try the cheesy jalapeño bread! Its great with any sandwich if you're looking for an extra kick! 

Oh yeah, and they have raspberry cheesecake cookies! 

Yep. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I come to this subway on a regular basis and they are always out of marinara.  Every time it is a different excuse as to why they don't have any remaining.  The service is always nice but that doesn't help when you can never get what you want.   You know it's bad when the first thing you ask before ordering your sandwich is \"do you have marinara\"."}
{"text":"As we all know, Subways are a dime a dozen, and the individual locations are as generally good as their management and employees!  This Particular location in South Scottsdale is excellent.  Kind, courteous, employees coupled with fresh veggies, meat, cheeses and bread make for a good subway experience!  This location is definitely one of the very best Subways I've ever been to, hence the positive review!  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Clean location, and fast. The guy that made our sandwiches was friendly and joked around with my kids when they traded in their \"Free Cookie\" coupons that they got from the Dbacks game.

Subway, in general, not just this location, has really skimped down on everything the last few years. I don't go to these shops often, but even since the last time I have been to one, the meat and the toppings seem to be getting less and less. Back in the 90's, this was the place to get HUGE sandwiches. Not that we need to be eating humungous servings, but I rather have tons of veggies instead of a sandwich that's mostly bread."}
{"text":"I should have read reviews before I went there! I do not understand how the Subway franchise allows this store to remain open with the low ratings it is getting! Apparently, my less than stellar experience is quite the norm. Teenagers who give not one eff. Teenagers who I am sure as rain falls from the clouds the manager, owner tells them to skimp all ingredients from the sandwiches? I will never set foot in any Subway ever. This location has killed it. Recently went to Jersey Mikes! Best dang subs ever. Full and I do mean full of meats, on buns with everything the menus state. Super nice young teenagers. The management team, husband and wife are perfect examples of caring people who treat there customers the way should be done! Especially Subway in Fort Mill, if you want repeat customers! I mean geese, piss enough off and you might lose all and have to close! Ta Ta Fort Mill Subway"}
{"text":"Should an employee be leaning on the counter texting?  Should I be able to walk from the front door all the way to the front counter and continue to watch him text?  That's not acceptable.  The food was average, typical subway bland, but I'm so sick of seeing people's faces buried in their phones, I shouldn't have to see it when people are supposed to be working, cleaning, making sandwiches, whatever.  I'm sure \"text on cell phone\" isn't a job duty.  I didn't see the guys name, but he was Asian and he had co-workers that should have told him not to be doing that."}
{"text":"I've been going to this subway for 5 years and have always had a good experience. Food always seems fresh and they always seem to have what I want in stock, which is more I can say about a lot of other subways. Staff seems as friendly as expected. Never dealt with management but never had to so I guess that's a plus!"}
{"text":"You would think subways are subways, but the individual owners of each one makes a huge difference.  I've seen some just not have spinach because they were too cheap, some others have quit having certain cheeses.  This place is about as stingy as it gets.

I got a normal 12\" and I swear even the bread looked shorter.  They put my 4 pieces of meat and a little cheese down and handed the sandwich off.  I asked for spinach, she put 3 pieces, I said a little more please, she gave me 1 leaf, I said, more please, and she looked at me with some scared eyes and gave me one more leaf.  I think she was afraid of being fired for putting more than 5 leaves of spinach on the sandwich.  Same thing with tomatoes.  Finally I just said screw it, its not worth begging for veggies.  Told them to put it in the bag, I paid, I left, I will never be back.

There is another sandwich store a couple doors down, do yourself a favor and just go there.  Don't think they have  a $5 footlong, but at least they'll give you what you ask for."}
{"text":"Wow this was one of the worst Subways I have been in....

- Only had two kinds of bread ready
- Meat was understocked
- Veggies were mostly gone
- Service was slow
- Place was super dirty!

Good thing I am moving away and never have to go here again!!"}
{"text":"When I first called them, they told me to call back in a few minutes....So I called back and they say they only have Honey-Oat bread.  We ordered 2-foot longs.  Went in, paid, went home and opened up the sandwiches and noticed that the Sandwich Artist was very skimpy on the meat and veggies.  Since I was in a hurry, I wasn't there to complain as they were making them.  I counted 4 spinach leaves on my sandwich and 3 cucumber slices...  

It's not like I used a coupon, we paid full price.  Big disappointment after spending almost $15.00 on 2 rather lame sandwiches. :("}
{"text":"Great food. HORRIBLE service. The men are always nice and welcoming. The women though...holy crap you would think they are being held against their will.  The brunette is Always crabby, even when you are so friendly to her.  None of them wear name tags. I'm assuming so we can't call them out in a review. The girl with the blonde hair that always has it in a braid is the worst!! Literally throws you DIRTY looks the whole time ordering and slams things around like she is being inconvenienced. I never get a smile or a welcoming feeling ever!! On Sunday New Year's Eve 12/31/17 me and my husband came around 2pm. There were 2 females working, didn't greet us and literally huffed and puffed as they were making our subs!! I couldn't believe the attitude we were getting. When they did make eye contact it was nasty looks. Once again they were not wearing name tags. I wouldn't go to this location if it wasn't within walking distance. I get no one \"wants\" to work, but if you can't even fake being nice in a CUSTOMER SERVICE job, maybe they need to start looking elsewhere. If the brunette is a manager I can see why the rest of the employees have attitude. She really sets an example with her attitude. I really hope this issue gets handled."}
{"text":"It's a Subway... The staff is personable and offers good suggestions. Everything seems as fresh as it can get at a subway."}
{"text":"If there was a way i could put zero stars i would. I had the WORST experience at this subway. We had a group of about 5 people we were on our way to an event. When we first walked in a lady walked out and said she was going on break and that a lady would be right out to serve us. We stood and waited about 2-3 mins till i had to say hello. This employee named Terry walked out and in the beginning was very rude. You can tell she did not want to make our sandwhiches. This Terry lady was rude about changing meats in the sandwhiches when i been to subway plenty of subways and others did it. She also messed up one of our sandwhiches. We requested ranch on it and she squirted it down with mayo. We told her it was mayo and she ignored us. We had to tell her about 3-4 times till she finally looked up and reliezed. I will never step foot into this subway ever again and if you do dont let Terry serve you!!!! Totally killed my subway vibe"}
{"text":"Girls never have a good attitude when I come in. If you don't like your job, go find another one. They put way too much sauce on my sandwich the other night to the point where I couldn't eat it without it falling apart. Never going back to this location again."}
{"text":"I really like this location!  I haven't been in a while but for lunch today I just felt like Subway, so decided to go.  It was about 1230pm when I arrived so a little bit of a line, but it truly didn't matter because even though I was behind 2 ladies who didn't know exactly what they were doing, they quickly brought out a new sammie maker from the back for me.  This young man had me done before the ladies in front of me were done building their salads, so he bumped and called me forward to the cash register, had me pay, and the ladies who were now behind me, had no choice but to notice and gnash their teeth while I happily thanked all the worker's and strolled out the door!  Haha - Love that!  By the time I reached my car, got my car started, dropped the transmission into drive and rolled out, those beezy's still hadn't stepped out of the building!  

I love good customer service....If people don't know what they want or what they're doing and hold things up, that should never translate to the people who do know what they want and what they're doing!  

So, there you have it.....Common damn sense at the Subway on Baseline & 19th Ave.  Good job, guys - I appreciate you!"}
{"text":"I purchased a fundraising coupon from my cousin which allows me to BOGO 12 inch or 6 inch subs, so my co-worker and I decided to venture on over to one of the two participating downtown subways, 930 Penn. the staff was friendly and we didn't have any problems when we attempted to use the coupon, which was nice. We ordered two 12 inch subs, one turkey breast and the other rotisserie chicken. I got got pickles, banana peppers, jalapeños, cucumbers, onions, southwest dressing and a small amount of lettuce on Italian, toasted. The veggies looked good and tasted fresh. (Side note: the tomatoes liked questionable. My co-worker pointed that out to me and he didn't get them on his sub because of it.) 

The restaurant itself was clean except for some crumbs on a few of the tables, but that's testament to a nicely toasted sub! 

Overall, great subway experience. :)"}
{"text":"I didn't even bother eating here. The facility was dirty like no one cleaned after the customers. When I went in there was no one behind the counter so I said hello but no one came out. Worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"I appreciate subway trying to get in the 24hr Vegas lifestyle but this would require not using old bread that's obviously sat out since the morning to be successful. I went in around 9pm because I had a long day and was starving but didn't want the weigh me down fast food right before bed. I regret every penny spent there. The bread was dry and fell apart immediately after I picked it up. It was literally hard to swallow. I ended up dissecting it and just eating the inside about 1/2 way through. It had almost no flavor at all and I got the works. I'm giving two stars because of the nice gentleman who has to sit in an empty restaurant all night because no one wants to eat there except for lunch. I felt bad for him. I'm pretty much done with subway. I'll spend the extra $2 for a nice capriottis sub next time and enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place has great sandwiches and the service was great. The place is clean and I got my sandwich quick and had no problems."}
{"text":"Upon walking into this particular Subway it didn't look very clean. Food on floors and tables not wiped down. I stood in line for 5 minutes and watched the workers gawking at me in an uncomfortable way, while whispering to each other. I walked right out and went next door to Senior Taco. Never going to that disgusting Subway again."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. Walked into this \"business\" tonight & only one person was working. She was helping someone so we waited. A white guy & his son walk in as soon as she's ringing out the first guy and before we can get up from the table she starts taking their order. That's ridiculous this place is horrible. Didn't even wash her hands"}
{"text":"Id give 4 to 5 stars for the current employees. They're always very nice and efficient. I had to score lower because its 90 degrees outside but feels like 105 degrees inside. Its always like this and ive messaged the owner before and nothing has ever been done."}
{"text":"Lady at the counter was completely rude.  Asked about a bathroom and she very impolitely and with an attitude told me there's no restroom.  Then when I went to order she again was rude and had attitude telling me I had to wait til she was done with what she's doing.  Not a problem if I have to wait but don't act like you're annoyed.  Something like \"it will be just a couple of minutes\" would suffice.  Didn't stay for food after that.  Obviously customer service isn't something that's taught at this location since others have complained about rude staff.  Don't go here unless you enjoy staff acting like they are annoyed you are there."}
{"text":"I thought the first time - maybe he was having a bad day but after going to this location 4 times now the older male in his late 40's or 50's is super miserable - acts like making your hoagie is a super inconvenience for him. No manners what so ever. Coughs and does not cover his mouth and sounds like he has a respiratory disease. HORRIBLE.   I will go out of my way to frequent a different location."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch and should have suspected something wrong when they were not busy at lunchtime,12:15pm. 2 people working - a sandwich maker, pleasant guy, efficient and a cashier who was slooooow. Maybe she was new but that is only an excuse if so.  The place was extremely hot- even customer behind me said so. When I finally cashed out I asked the gal if she could turn down the AC and was told as soon as they finish with customers?  Uh, what am I? As slow as they are, needless to say they never turned down the AC. It was just a bad lunch experience. If you can pick a different subway do do- the service is generally good"}
{"text":"Good cheap eats for a quick meal getaway. Ordered a foot long sweet onion teriyaki chicken sub with all the works. Took a longer time than usual but was made right."}
{"text":"This subway provided me the worst service I have ever received from a fast food restaurant. First we waited in the drive thru like for literally 20 minutes before even been helped. Then once pulled up to the window we were greeted with a LOVELY \"you are going to have to wait we are getting caught up on that last order\" so we waited just to get two terribly put together sandwiches. My boyfriend got a turkey bacon club missing bacon. Didn't ask for onions but they came on the sandwich. Mine was supposed to have vinegar and oil and mayo it had none. Also ended up getting shredded cheese rather than the cheese we asked for. We called to tell management  about what happened and ended up leaving a message for a manager getting promised numerous times a call back. We never received a call it is now two days later. Worst subway ever."}
{"text":"I had a very good experience at this Subway. The people were friendly, fast, and detailed all the way through. My sub was perfect, my daughter loved hers as well, so why complain, right? Everything looked and tasted fresh, and the ladies had a great sense of humor, so it was an entertaining experience."}
{"text":"Still the worst subway ever.  Can't believe I went back again.  2 people in front of me and 3 employees on the clock and still took 20 mins.

For some reason they don't do the thing here where one employee get the meat and bread and the other does the veggies.  Not sure why.  They also rarely seem to have all of their breads made.  Its pretty sad.  No spinach either.  Hate to say it, but the slowest Wendy's in town, that is right next door and is always super busy is faster than subway."}
{"text":"Nice brand new Subway really close to my house.  Excellent and friendly customer service.  Location is great - near several grocery stores, several restaurants, and a gas station.  I used a coupon and it saved me a lot of money!"}
{"text":"Don't go there at 7:11am. They are NOT open. Sign says 7:00-, the lady inside just looked at me. Guess I won't be having breakfast at Subway"}
{"text":"Customer service is average. It is just like any other subway, not bad, not great, just a sandwich place"}
{"text":"Typical subway to me. Service is friendly. Cleanliness is average. Would like to see them clean tables more often. Cookies are delicious. I have had fresher bread at other franchises. Would like them to carry caffeine free diet coke, but good drink selections. Drive thru is generally fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I have bought a cheese beef sandwich this afternoon about 5 PM. Hey I cheese was melted on the beef girl wrapped the sandwich up and set it on the counter. Another customer came in and before I could get cash out she's already start making sandwiches for the other person. I finally had to ask her to cash me out and the lady getting the sandwiches apologize and the girl said oh that's right that's what I'm supposed to do. Yeah the lady was not having any hot sandwiches but my beef and cheese sandwich set cooling off. Terrible service!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chopped salad. The store was out of provolone cheese, so I got hot pepper cheese which is fine. They make my salad and the sandwich for my daughter who was with me and we were going to eat in the store. Then girl asks if I want silverware. I said yes. And they say they are out of that. I told her it was kinda hard to eat a salad without a fork. Then she wanted me to pay for it all. I told her we don't want it if I can't eat it. 
  As we walked out she yell \"you shouldn't of had me make the f**king food then. It's not our fault. And I told her it's not our fault you didn't tell us till after you made it. \". I will never eat at that subway again."}
{"text":"Food is good it is a subway after all. It's open 24 7 for late night Cold cut combos. I mean can subway be bad it's a sandwich?"}
{"text":"I got a party tray for a Christmas Party I was having and In a pinch I went with Subway. They gave me tons of toppings and condiments def would get again. They said it would feed 20 it did and I still had plenty left over. By far the best deal and easiest solution to party catering ever."}
{"text":"3pm Saturday afternoon 9/3/16
No one else here... Girl working by herself... Very bad attitude. I ordered new Ceasar melt Sandwich and had to tell her how to make it. Didn't say thank you. After we paid, she couldn't wait to sit down and get on her phone...even though the place was a mess and there were empty food containers that needed filled."}
{"text":"Very dirty...trash all over the floor on saturday 02/14/15 about 12:00pm. Fresh out of the oven bread placed next to the trashy floor.
Ordered a sandwich and the girl had to throw out the meat that was in the bin...\"it looked bad\"...wonder how long it was there. Very difficult to place the order because of the constant banter between the 2 employees.
Horrible place compared to other Subway's in town."}
{"text":"Very quick friendly service. When i asked for double meat Joshi alerted me of the 3.00 additional charge before he completed my sandwich. Also the facility was very clean."}
{"text":"We walked in ten minutes to close. There was someone in front of us so we figured it would be okay to jump in line. The Sandwich Artists name was Grace. She seemed irritated that we were there so when it was our turn we started to apologize and thank her for making our sandwiches but she cut us off mid apology and asked us what kind of sandwich we needed. My friend and I looked at eachother in awe that she cut us off. We genuinely felt bad until that happened. This got 2 stars because I really like subway sandwiches. I'm just extremely disappointed with the service we received and the way we were treated while trying to be apologetic."}
{"text":"Good experience, gentleman behind the counter was very nice and made the order fast. Restaurant looked very clean and the mints on the way out were a nice touch. I think the dine in baskets are smart and reduce waste while eating in."}
{"text":"My Husband and I went into this subway location on Baseline and Dobson in Mesa AZ shortly after 5 pm today and there was a lady who was helping a customer with her meal. and the guy that walked up to us said hi, we asked him what sandwiched were not included on the $6.00 deal and he said only the local favorites. I asked him if the new turkey was on the deal and being that is was not one that he said was excluded I was going to buy it, then he said no that was not included, this young boy working behind the counter contradicted himself and I then said you told us the only sandwiched that were not included were the local favorites and that was not a local favorite. in Mid sentence he turned around and walked away into the back room, I said Hello??? he was gone, I said to the other employee \" how rude\" all we wanted was clarification. the lady tried to save his backside by telling us she would wait on us, my husband and I left in shock that this kid  was so rude, we went to chipotles where we spent 18.00 and no one gave us a bad attitude. we will never go there again and I am also going to paste this onto yelp so everyone can see what bad business and help subway has employed there at this location!"}
{"text":"Stek and cheese sub was fine.
The lack of seating is abysmal.
Restrooms not avail-that's a first."}
{"text":"Subway on Glendale and N58th is NASTY. The bathrooms look like someone ate Taco Bell then went to Subway to let it all out. Ick."}
{"text":"I wish I could give the store zero stars. This review has nothing to do with the food or the cleanliness of the store or Subway at all in general. This review is specifically about the manager of this location. I work in customer service and this person should never be allowed to represent the subway franchise on any level, employee or manager. He insulted my girl friend and brought her to tears. When I asked for the owners name and information he told me he did not have it. BS! every store manager has the district managers name and number and the owner of the store information. I have been working with hundreds of subways in my career and know a little more about subways then most people. Normally a subway owner will own multiple location and something Even dozens. Then when I made a corporate complaint the district manager told me that I was a Lying about my story, what horrible people they have representing  the franchise in this community. What reason do I have to lie the DM and GM must be friends outside of work because no supervisor should ever cover for employee misconduct. THIS IS WHY I HAVE NOT EATEN AT ONE SUBWAY SINCE AND WILL NEVER GIVE THE ORGANIZATION MY MONEY AGIAN."}
{"text":"First I want to say I love Subway subs, I just dislike this particular store. The people who work there are very cheap and do not put enough toppings on the subs, even when you ask for more they take two or three pieces of the topping to add but pretend they are adding more by moving their hand quickly around the sub. Forget about polite service as well, they don't look at you when they speak to you and you won't get a \"thank you\" when the transaction is complete. Avoid this location all together"}
{"text":"I go here regularly. I'm not affiliated at all with the place, so this is a totally independent review from a regular customer. I saw the (now old) reviews on this place complaining about customer service, but I've never had a problem, so I had to chime in here.  They have always been friendly and courteous to me. It's true that Subway is Subway, but most of the time that is enough for me when I need a quick lunch. It's consistent and good and generally a good value. Maybe not exceptional enough to get 5 stars, but a solid 4 in my book."}
{"text":"The two fellows working here looked like they did not care one bit. The first time he tried he dropped the entire foot-long on the floor. The second try, he dropped half of the chicken, and continued his merry way. The person with me got the wrong bread, and he was unwilling to listen.  Worst Subway I have been in a long time."}
{"text":"Lol wish I could give 0 stars. First off, the woman that was making my food was extremely rude from the very beginning. Just a terrible attitude. Then I paid for 3 cookies and I didn't realize she had only given me two, which were terrible by the one. One of them was so hard, it wasn't even edible. And when I tried to call the store( I called 3 times) with no answer. Won't be going back. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Foods fine, service sucks for the most part. They run it like a cafeteria, I honestly don't care, it's quick service, healthier option than fast food. I remember a few years ago, they had 5 dollar footlongs, now they are like 10. Fun fact, if you say takeout, it's two dollars less and they can't call you a liar on it. However my biggest gripe...

They keep the restroom locked and closed all the time! They claim it's out of order constantly, it's been a year, can't someone come and fix it in that time? It's not broken, they just don't want to clean it.  Very inconvenient if I need to use the restroom during my lunch.  There a lot of parts of my job I don't like either, but I can't just lock the bathroom and say it's broken.  Kinda crazy...eat fresh, go take it somewhere else."}
{"text":"I worked here for over a year. While I was there, I was screamed at, accused of stealing, snapped at , spoken over and basically treated like scum. I was fired because I asked the owners husband not to yell at me.

I recently returned to this Subway to try and have a nice lunch, only to find out things have not changed. I will not support this kind of employee abuse and I do not think anyone else should either. We are in America. This is all."}
{"text":"Just had the best customer service experience and all I got was a quick 6inch Tuna but she just owned the store and made everyone feel good. Plus the Sandwich was Fire!!"}
{"text":"Totally not worth it by far the worst subway ever, can you say ghetto!!! Kids can no longer choose which meat they want, they skimp on all the Ingredients, they dont bother to run any air conditioner its hot and humid and miserable in AZ for god sake, then they lock their bathrooms and you have to stand in line to get a key like a disgusting road stop gas station....the staff is rude and unconcerned definitely not a place that values their customers.....avoid!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great location. Very large parking lot and you get your food quick during lunch time. I often see the same employees who are well experienced and trained. I work in the University Park, so this location is ideal for me."}
{"text":"Service was great but sandwich was all bread and no meat this happened to me and my buddy in the same day. I'm just hoping this won't be the trend with the new $6 foot long."}
{"text":"I come here all the time, the parking lot kinda blows bc of the way its set up, But theres a liquor store next door so that's awesome. I'm always in and out with no issues I'm so surprised about the other reviews.
I love that they have orange Fanta also. I have bought some cookies and they were good. I'm picky about cookies I like them to be soft not hard and store bought tasting."}
{"text":"This subway has been out go to spot for years now. The service has pretty much always been awesome and quick with our regular guys. It's when there has been someone else that it's been a problem. Only reason I put 4 stars is because since we've started coming here they have gotten a lot lighter on the toppings. So don't be shy when asking for more!"}
{"text":"Been waiting to pay for my subs for about ten min with the two lady's looking like there to high to operate a cash drawer"}
{"text":"This is the closest Subway Sandwich Shop, to my house. 

The shopping center is a bit difficult to get in and out of... Also navigating through the parking lot is quite difficult. 

It's never too busy... Usually only 3 or 4 people ahead of you, at the most!

The dining room is very small. However, it's always clean. The men's bathroom is also always clean! 

The service is always fast and friendly, and everything is always well stocked.

If you are in the area, I would recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"Last time I come here. Got a steak and cheese and didn't want it toasted. So they put the cold steak on the bun and never heated the meat. It's so cold, I can't even eat it. No sugar free drinks. With my mom who's diabetic and they have nothing here for her to drink."}
{"text":"I honestly love Subway. Not only is it somewhat healthy, but it's also very delicious and affordable. A meal combo is almost always under $10- for my order, this includes a foot long Italian BMT, chips and a large drink. Not a bad deal considering the service is fast and can easily be taken to go and eaten in the car. 
This particular Subway is a little bit smaller. However, there is outside seating but I'd only recommend using it in the winter months or if it's covered by shade. This location is always clean and I have never had any problems with the staff. The employees always ask about my day and each has a genuine smile on their face. I enjoy visiting because I receive great customer service each time. I truly appreciate this.
The only recommendation I have is to figure out a way to change the location of the line that forms during busy times. I realize the location is small, so this may be difficult to do. But it's awkward to have those who are ordering standing right next to someone who is trying to enjoy a meal. I like how the new Subway in Flagstaff has a clear area directly in front of the doors where a line can form, but doesn't surround any tables. I think it would make the customers experience much better. And I would increase my rating to 5 stars. Thank you for the consideration."}
{"text":"Not gluten free friendly:-( my friend handed the waiter $2.00 tip she never said thank you"}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times so far. Usually decent service. Tedious access off Mayo Blvd, they are near the traffic light at Mayo and Allied Way. Plentiful parking and some tables outside from eateries next door. They are almost next door to Starbucks on Mayo.

For several trips here they employed a young man wearing his cap with a twist, which I believe conveys gang affiliation. This was rather worrisome. Luckily  I have not seen him there lately. This neighborhood does not need to import any street gang trouble. 

Usually the service here is fast and accurate.

One suggestion, always depart this mall at one of the two driveways with a traffic light or you can end up sitting waiting for a long time."}
{"text":"Anything you would expect a typical Subway. Nothing really stands out or is blatantly bad except that it's in a deserted strip mall next to a liquor store."}
{"text":"Usually very fast and clean. Today it took longer to make my sandwich but there was a new girl being trained so I get it. Overall the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this Subway, ever. Quick service even though it was right around lunch time. Not much for seating inside and what there was for seating was mostly taken up by some men who clearly worked together but were sitting at separate tables? I got the chicken bacon avocado wrap, typically when I get one wrap somewhere else it is the cost of a 6inch, if you get 2 wraps it is a foot long...imagine my surprise when my dinky wrapped package was $7 with tax. If price had been lower for sure would've been 5  rating."}
{"text":"This place is aweful. I got a drink and sandwich and didn't even walk out with a drink. I was on a hurry and the lady didn't give it to me. 
Guess that's how they make heir profit. The girls that work there are lazy. Don't greet you, and aren't too big on wanting to serve you. 
Also skimped out on the toppings."}
{"text":"This subway, because of its hidden location, works hard to give you a great value for your money. I had the Spicy Italian and it was packed with ingredients. I wii definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is very unprofessional. My mom and I decided to grab a bite before a doctors appointment. We should have gone to another location the store seemed clean inside the workers made our footlong sloppy and when i paid i didn't receive any change or receipt. Thank you have a good day we will not be returning. Basically the employees pocket peoples change all day."}
{"text":"A pretty standard subway, only thing is that the area that it's in is a little sketch so you'll have some weird people walk in. It doesn't help that it's right next to a weed dispensary."}
{"text":"I went to this subway today so that I didn't have to make dinner after a long week. I was promptly greeted by two young employees. They both really just impressed me! They were friendly, presentable, they helped each other, they were polite, and efficient and they were such a joy to be around! They were both excited to go to prom tmrw, and we briefly chatted about their plans etc. They asked me if I had fun at my prom and if I had any kids going to prom soon. Silly stuff maybe, but I was seriously impressed with their interest in me as a customer, and their ability to make small talk and make my \"errand\" more enjoyable! What great \"kids\"! And my subs were delicious and very fresh! Well done to this subway, these employees, and their parents!"}
{"text":"I love subway restaurants but this one had to be one of the worst I have ever been in. Maxwell was are worker, and he was incredibly rude. Not only did he make us wait for him to make the bread when we were the only ones inside, he also didn't ask of if we wanted our sandwiches toasted but preceded to anyways. He also refused to put extra cheese on our sandwiches. Then when the sandwiches came out of the toaster oven, the cheese had slide off and he didn't do anything about it, all the vegetables were old and lettuce browning, they didn't have a lot of the sauces. The worker was extremely rude the entire time, and not just to me but everyone that came in.You would figure in Las Vegas where there are always a lot of people coming in the subway would try to hire better employees and keep the ingredients fresh."}
{"text":"Worst subway I've ever been to. Bread is dry ingredients are soggy. Employees do not listen and hate life. A little mayo apparently means one fat greasy soggy line of mayo. Dijon and pepperoncinis apparently doesn't mean anything to them. I almost got buffalo sauce when I said spicy mustard. 

If you come here pay attention while they make it and be willing to walk away from the grease mountain sandwich when they mess it up."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this one star because zero is not an option. My girlfriend and I came in at 12 and didn't get our sandwiches until 1!!! There was two guys ahead of us!!!  The girl working was very very rude, I mistaked which sandwich I wanted for another and changed it after apologizing about it. Then she asks my girlfriend after she chooses her sandwich, \"you know what comes on that right.\" Rolled her eyes the entire time, she even told a customer before me \" I don't have all day \" unsure if they knew each other or what. But horrible customer service from this girl. My sandwich was okay though so it's whateverrrr."}
{"text":"Very small but friendly staff.  But I can definitely see why they only have a 93 sanitation score!  May want to wear gloves more often, lol."}
{"text":"The product seems on par at this location but the service levels vary depending on who is working and/or what time you go.  The red head girl is constantly working and hustling every time I have been in the store.  The chubby hispanic manager Manny is very inconsistent.  Occasionally he is engaging and hustling but most of the time he is very slow moving and non engaging.  He seems very lazy and moody at times.

This location does not have its hours posted on the door so you can never tell for sure when the place opens or closes.  I have been there in the morning and am told different opening times by different employees.  I have been there at night and the place is open and the doors are unlocked but they turn off the open sign and turn off a majority of the lights to make the place look closed.  I am not sure 100% why they do this but I have my ideas.  You can never be sure how your experience will be here as this place is a coin flip every time."}
{"text":"It's subway, so you know what to expect. The reason I'm giving it four starts is that every time I come in here the staff is so friendly. Good customer service always goes a long way for me."}
{"text":"Great food I ordered steak sandwich with herb and cheese bread sandwich artist gave me really good service"}
{"text":"Do not go here if you want your sandwiches fast. This is the second time I've gone and they are sooooo slow! Just go down .25miles to Jimmy Johns, so much faster!!"}
{"text":"Sandwich was awesome.   Thing was, I ordered a drink, and when I went to get ice, the ice machine chugged out these black and rust colored chunks of whatever in amongst the ice  ( I thought they were bugs at first , but they weren't, thank god). 

I showed the cashier the problem, and she said \"we already fixed that\".   I said to her \"well, maybe so, but the current ice has stuff still in it\".   She just shrugged me off. 

So.   What this makes me think of is that if she or they don't care about something so blatantly gross, what else don't they care about?   

Not going back.. there are way more other Subways to choose from."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst Subways I have EVER been to. 

Right in front of my eyes, the woman cutting the baguette squished it right into the counter. She then continued to sloppily make my sandwich as though she was making a garbage masterpiece. I looked at her like she should care that she was making my meal, but she continued to throw the baguette around like it was garbage and stuff it every which way with a smidgen of this and a smidgen of that. 

I have only been to this location once and plan on keeping it that way. 

Worst service ever."}
{"text":"This particular store is located inside the Plaza Hotel & Casino. During my 4-day stay so far, I have been very pleased overall. Their employees have outstanding customer service skills & are efficient in their work habits. Although the prices on their items may be a bit higher than a typical franchise location, the product is excellent. 

Furthermore, the employees at the Plaza Hotel Subway are very organized with each of their items, food & condiments. Since I have been short on cash overall, I have been able to fill out surveys from the receipts which reward you with a free cookie. This Subway location had no problem in allowing that. 

Oh yeah, and they're open 24/7!  The one knock I have on them is that the inside could be more spacious, but otherwise the store does the best with everything they have. I sincerely don't mind eating each of my meals here"}
{"text":"This is my favorite subway. Although for some reason they are never fully staffed. I have been in Line sense 10:50
It is now 11:15 and I still have the same 4 people in front of me. 
One sandwich artists, and the order she is working on is apparently huge! 
It would be nice to come into Subway for lunch and be able to enjoy my sandwich at a table and not on my way back to work in my car."}
{"text":"This place is under new management and the employees and service are awesome they always know what I order everytime I walk in...the dinning room area was fully stocked and very clean...my sandwhich was delicious and you can even grab a tastey donut for dessert"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I actually enjoy the Subway franchise, but recently I went here for a sub and a few hours after I ate and had gone to bed, I woke up and started violently vomiting. Turns out I got food poisoning. Now let me tell you why I think it was Subway, I hadn't had anything else besides a bagel earlier that day for breakfast and I ate there at 2am, which is another thing the food had probably been sitting out for a few hours and silly me HAD to get double meat. I find it kind of humorous that Subway's slogan is \"Eat Fresh\", and this particular Subway obviously doesn't represent that slogan in a very positive light."}
{"text":"My boyfriend always comes to this subway because his school is right around the corner.. but today was so  different (in a good way). Chrystee is by far the best at what she does she was so friendly and interactive with us it was great!! She also had us in and out of there like it was the easiest thing! I've never had customer service like that before and I hope I see her there again soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst subway i've ever been too. I love subway, but this location made me never want to eat subway again. I have been to this location 3 times. My 1st was terrible, my sandwich was crap. and the customer service was bad as well. I went my 2nd time and had a pretty decent experience, but there was different people working so the customer service was decent as well. keep in mind, i live like 2 seconds away from this subway location so its pretty convenient. And at last, my 3rd time and my LAST! i went in, and the lady was super rude got mad that i wanted my bread toasted. and the soda machine was watered down. I'm eating my sub inside their store, and as i'm eating my sub, a little piece of chicken fell and it was black in a little area, and super red on the inside. I almost threw up. I showed the manager and he said that's how the chicken comes, they don't prepare it. He offered me a free cookie... like are you crazy! this meat looks nasty! Terrible place, i believe they use old bread and meats. nothing is fresh there ! DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"5:55pm make internet order for 5 sandwiches pick up, 6:30pm

6:30pm arrive to pick up sandwiches. Told that there has been a line and that it \"going to be a long time.  We do online orders when the line is done.\"

6:55pm Order ready. \"Sorry about the wait can i get you a cookie?\"

Get home, missing 5 cookies... Are you serious?  Call back no help, call the manager tomorrow...

Do NOT try and order from the internet at this location!

Management, I know they're kids but please coach them on customer service and service recovery"}
{"text":"gets very busy no matter what time a day i go here. but well worth the wait. monthly footlong specials."}
{"text":"Overall, great Subway. Clean with polite staff. Open 24/7 is a bonus - it's very close to my house which works out. Sometimes the staff, which usually consists of some younger employees, can get kind of retarded when they think nobody's watching. Kids will be kids, I guess, as long as it doesn't effect my sandwich."}
{"text":"My go-to subway. Fast and friendly. Always pretty slow when i come in but in the busier times they are still on top of it. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous how their bathrooms aren't open to the public! That's just being cheap trying to have a low water bill! And yes, I know that's why they do that! Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Not the most welcoming subway I have been to. Very stingy with veggies...as if onions and green peppers are costly."}
{"text":"I came specifically for the broccoli cheddar soup.... They have a sign that says they have it but come to find out they don't. Then the lady in front of me ordered a sandwich she has always order for years and apparently they have also stopped serving it and made her pay extra to add on bacon to make it the meal she always gets. Then to top it off their internet was down and only accepted cash. This turned out to be a bummed out trip. I know there is nothing they could do about the internet but everything else? I would've waited til they made more soup but they never asked if I would wait or tried to offer me something different. So instead my boyfriend got his sandwich and I went on to McDonalds."}
{"text":"I have a love / hate relationship with subway. 

Sometimes the food is good, and sometimes...... it's meeeh. But what can I expect?

I walked in , and there was only one girl working, (around 1230). My sandwich was made

just right, and the girl didn't give me attitude when I asked for all sauces on the side....So

that it wouldn't get soggy. The only thing that looks like it might get negative, is when more

people were coming in. i could tell the girl was becoming overwhelmed."}
{"text":"So went in last night maybe an hour before close. The second I walk in, the girl in the counter shouts to her coworker in an empty building \" are you fucking serious?\" With a disgusted look on her face. I ask her if she had a problem then goes off saying that this is just a job and she doesn't give a shit....I wanted to leave so bad but I was hungry and not wasting time and resource cause some lil princess has to actually work in order to get paid.... What a joke."}
{"text":"Usually employees at Subway seems down or just unhappy, that was NOT the case here. The sandwich maker was so upbeat and joyous it actually put a smile on my face! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"So it's buy one get one free sandwich. Hidden scam, you must buy a medium drink. So, it's 6pm, dinner hour. Even though they know the offer is going on, they have no bread left, except, whole wheat and a few cheese bread. Duh! You should have had plenty made for this promo. The franchise owner is no where to be found. Maybe Mr Babcock needs to get behind the counter and do some work. The employees were overwhelmed. They had this deer in the headlights, spaced out look on their faces. Many people like myself, just walked out. Mr Babcock, epic fail!"}
{"text":"this place sucks. the employees are very rude and you can tell they don't give a shit."}
{"text":"Worst subway ever so they have this special $5 for 16 oz drink 6' sub and cookie I ordered a turkey Brest with no turkey the staff told me I could not have the deal because it was extra . Extra to not have meat I have never heard of it in my life do not go to this location the staff was not nice a women in front of me ordered the same special and did not want the cookie so the lady said I have to charge you full price for each think which is $5.70 instead of $5.00 once again charged more for less I don't get it at all"}
{"text":"I really like the service here. I usually stop for breakfast. This is my favorite Subway. It's always clean."}
{"text":"Best service I've had from subway in a long time. The shift leader was awesome. Easily the best around town. Will be going to this one even though one is closer to my house"}
{"text":"Ordered food online, and the food wasn't ready until 15 mins after they told us to come pick it up. Out of items we ordered, and wouldn't give us all the items we paid for. Very bad experience, won't be back."}
{"text":"Subway usually low key trash. The two guys working right now though are dope. Made the sandwiches well and they were very friendly and accommodating. This location has good/fresh veggies."}
{"text":"i went to this subway for lunch today, and i must say i am very disappointed with this store. The staff was rude and gave me attitude for asking them if they could toast my sandwich! isnt subway known for toasting their sandwiches? the bathroom looked like it hasnt been cleaned since the store open! their food wasnt that fresh! im just so sad i wasted my time there for lunch: ("}
{"text":"I went today before work and was waiting on by a lady named Jenna I typically only get meat cheese olives and sometimes a very little bit of spinach online sandwiches nothing extravagant I'm pretty picky well I asked for a footlong turkey Italiano with a lot of olives and she replied with I can't give you a lot of Olives cuz we don't have a whole lot and I have to take it easy cuz I have other customers so this will have to do rude sarcastic very let down and disappointed because I eat at Subway at least 3 times a week by far the worst subway experience I've ever had will not be back to that location"}
{"text":"I've given this Subway a few chances and today was the last time. I took three kids in and spent $25 on three sandwiches two drinks and chips. My 2 year old dropped his cookie and when I asked for another one the guy working there said \"you know you're going to have to pay for it.\" Every time I go here I get nasty service, it is usually filthy. Filthy enough that the health department should probably check it out. I would avoid this place at all costs. As a member of the Jewish community I am very disappointed. Go to a regular subway shop."}
{"text":"I always visit the same place for a while before I rate it. I've been visiting this subway for about 9 month now and I have never been disappointed. This subway is between my work and home, and it's not really on the way. But when I want a subway I always try to come here as much as I can. I have a subway a block away from my house but they always overcharge me for the same sandwich. So I'm willing to got the extra mile just to eat here because I know that I will get the best deal. This place is always busy, and it speaks for itself, people love to be here. Staff is prompted, organized, fast and the place is always clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"This Subway is in the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten at this particular restaurant several times and it was just regular old Subway.  There are so many better choices near by for sandwiches,  I can't seem to understand how this place can be so busy.  Subway claims to want to offer better health choices for customers, yet they regularly offer \"footlong\" subs that are marginally more expensive than a 6-inch sandwich.

If you are looking for a decent sandwich in the area, head over to Crave (my favorite) or corner bakery."}
{"text":"Note: This location gets pretty busy during lunch hour.  The guys who work during the day are always smiling and very friendly.  The store is always clean and the ingredients are always fresh.  This is one of my favorite lunch spots and I come at least once a week."}
{"text":"This review is about the service not the food! The manager here his name is Greg is really rude! We witness him yell at this customer multiple times because he couldn't hear him. After that we were next he seemed angry for no reason and when we asked him to substitute something he threw what he had picked up in his hand angrily back to the food area!! The two cashiers were nice but he was just being rude to all his customers! It is never acceptable to yell at customers that way specially since the customer he was dealing with was an older gentlemen who just had a softer voice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Subways in town because the bread is always fresh and service is friendly.  They recently upgraded the dining room and there are now cozy booths and more tables.  I frequently go out of my way to visit this shop because they're so consistent and reliable."}
{"text":"Getting away from the greasy hullabaloo of Plaza Midwood for a quick and healthy lunch (with Jared!) is easy at this Subway location.  It's large and just enough out of the way that there's always a seat.  It also happens to have nice bathrooms.  I can't remember the last time I  was at a Subway with nice bathrooms.  And they definitely get points for cleanliness.  

However I'm withholding a star because the customer service can be sub-par.  The sandwich maker and cashier simply don't seem to want to talk much.  Maybe they were having a bad day when I visited.  I promise it's not my fault!"}
{"text":"Ordered a salad , asked for a fork to eat with.  Was told \"We don't have forks but you can go down a few stores to the Mexican place and they will give you one.\"  Had to re check my brain on that statement.  Told them if I wanted Mexican for lunch with a fork I would have gone there.  They got manager on phone and was told to go to Harris Teeter to get fork.  Now I am looking for cameras cause I know I am on Candiid Camera or some other type of reality show trying to see if people will revert back to caveman days and eat a salad with their fingers.  Nope... no camera!  Ask for my money back from the manager over the phone did not want to do that either  but finally did.  True story folks!  Don't believe me??  Stop by and ask for a fork!"}
{"text":"Nice little location.  My sub was fresh and the servers are friendly.  They summer $4 lunch deals cannot be beat!  The only weird thing about this location is the seating.  There is not much and the layout is very odd."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and said hello as soon as I walked in. Even let me know he'd be with me in a second while he was making another customer's sandwich. Clean, friendly and quick."}
{"text":"The food was fine but the service was horrendous. I could barely understand the girl helping me as she was soft spoken and had an accent. Another customer came in after I did and waited 4.5 to 5 minutes before a staff member came out from the back. The only reason the staff member came out was because the customer yelled for them. I could hear the staff playing a video on their phone in the back. Each time they finished with a customer they would run to the back and watch the video again. Subway should be concerned about this franchise not living up to their expectations."}
{"text":"Even for a Subway this location leaves a lot of room for improvement.   The lady who was making our sandwiches couldn't hear us and asked us to repeat ourselves several times,  and we were the only ones there.  The back counters were a jumbled mess of napkins and bags and food, reminds me of my bachelor days apartment kitchen."}
{"text":"Veggie delights come with avocado, especially if your are not getting any cheese. Don't tell me it's included and the charge me for it when I get to the register. $16 for 2 veggie delights?"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already & I keep coming back bc of the incredible staff & when I mean incredible staff I mean Leaire, (would have given this a 5 star for her) she always makes me feel welcomed & loves to ask about my day & how my week was & gets my order perfect instead of asking her for more things. This last time I came, I was with a girl Alexandria. WORST employee you guys have there, she was so rude & looked like she hated being there with the plainest attitude. Was giving her coworker rude looks & I had her fix my sandwich about 2-3 times bc she just being stingy with the amount. \"Have if your way\" ha more like have her HER way. Defiantly will be calling ahead to see if Leaire is working because I guess it's kinda hard for some people to make a sandwich."}
{"text":"Got a sandwich today on stale Italian bread. They had two containers of brown lettuce and no fresh in the back, so I was told. How do you not have any more lettuce for the rest of the day??!?! I'll never be back here. Should have gone to Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Worst subway ever! Shitty service, employees who could care less about the quality of the sandwich and half the staff looks like they are 15 years old. Everyone that works there looks like they want to be somewhere else too. And to top it off we found hair in my husbands sandwich!! Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Let me start off with something positive. The two gentlemen that helped me this past week were very nice. 

Now for the bad...

The past two times I've been to this Subway, they've been out of something. The first time it was tuna and this past week I went in and they were literally out of all the bread! All they had was a few 6 inch pieces of bread left that I could choose from and told me that they had flatbread I could use since I was wanting a foot long. I ended up getting the last two 6\" pieces they had left which was a white and wheat bread. To make matters even worse, the door had been left wide open to the storage unit that they keep the bread in to keep it fresh so my bread was a little stale. Next, I get to the vegis and the guy tells me that they are out of a lot of the vegetables! How does that happen, Subway! It was around 7 that I went in so it's not like you were running low because you were about to close! And not only that, but the lids that are supposed to be covering all the vegis, meat, ect. to keep them from going bad were all stacked in the middle of the bar in a huge pile! It's safe to say that I'll be going to the Subway on 24th St. and Baseline from now on."}
{"text":"Just waited 15 minutes in line, at 2 pm. Ridiculous. Didn't ask for here or to go. Didn't give me a cup for my meal. Terrible, unfriendly, SLOW  barely audible order takers."}
{"text":"Great Subway location which closed about a month ago. Convenient to everything and the food was always first class. Lost a good one."}
{"text":"Drove around for almost 2 hours just looking for something to eat and ended coming to subway on the way back home.. and I am so glad that we did! I got there around 10:30pm and got helped by the nicest person ever, Anthony. He was incredibly helpful and kind.. you just don't get that anymore nowadays. (Thank you Anthony) 

We were pretty indecisive so Anthony helped us decide. We got four 6in subs..Tuna, oven roasted chicken breast, steak & cheese, and turkey breast ~~~ everything was fresh and tasted awesome. Great selection ~ and I totally love the Siracha sauce  

Ty for a great experience! Will def be back 



**3/23/17 Friday night/morning
Just wanted to say this location is great. Tyler is always so friendly, like incredibly nice!! (Anthony too) He always seems like he's in the best mood ever and always has a big smile on his face and you just can't help but smile too. Super helpful and makes those subs just right!!


**3/28/17 Tuesday 9:30pm
I'm not sure what his name is.. the receipt said Alex. He had long hair and tattoos all over his arms. He was such a jerk and had the nastiest attitude ever. Sucks Tyler was busy in the back and we didn't get him. If I ever come here and I see Alex working, I'm walking right back out the door. Wow was he awful. He should not have a job where he interacts with people. Lame!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Line super long and not because sandwiches weren't being made fast enough, but because they only had one register in operation and an incompetent worker operating it. The sandwiches were made and handed over at the beginning of the line. You then had to wait for 10 minutes to get to the register. There were no obvious technical issues with the register, simply operator error.

My meatball sub had a couple burnt meatballs in it and was very disappointing. I used the bathroom after having to get a key and went to wash my hands.....yep no hand soap! Wow its just one thing after another with this place. I wont ever go back here thats for sure!"}
{"text":"The servers were cold and machine like.  The line was long, there weren't enough workers to move it any faster, pilots and flight crews got to cut in front of everyone (which sometimes I understand, but if the pilot has a three hour delay, they'd still use that short-cut line), and the prices were absolutely stupid.

Worse still they were stingy as hell with the toppings.  I had to ask them \"Can I get some more _____, please\" and after asking a few times it was down to \"more.\"

The jerk at the end didn't even cut my sammich, and I'm used to that being done without me asking, so I had to wield a foot long turkey sub without any decent place to sit down.

I won't be going back (and frankly I hate that airport to begin with)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this subway. Staff are nice and friendly. There has never a time I have been dissatisfied with their food and service. And they actually give you generous amounts of what ever you ask them, instead of making you a thin sandwich.  I live close by and I love coming to this one. Even though there is another one right up the street On 44th."}
{"text":"They need to update you hours for Sunday as I have gone two Sundays in a row and they were closed at 8:00 not 9:00. The door and online says 9:00 but obviously it is not."}
{"text":"This Subway needs to get its act together. I have been there 3 times this summer and there have been different staff each time and none of them knew what they were doing. My sandwiches were poorly made and I couldn't even finish the one that had cold chicken. I also asked for one of their new sandwiches and they didn't even make it properly and then they over charged me. Note to the owner - get a manager that can train their staff properly and then keep them."}
{"text":"They make good sandwiches and don't skimp you , but they really need to turn the open sign on in the mornings ."}
{"text":"Midnight shift older Mexican lady: she sucks so bad she should retire . Made me wait ten minutes in the drive through before I asked if I can order. She told me she had customers inside please wait. So I park the car and go inside and there was two guys eating a sandwich and she had me wait ten minutes and not tell me ?!? So she takes my order and it took her 15 minutes to make my sandwich , just mine nobody else ( there was no one else there except the two guys eating ) she then skimps my sandwich and refuses to put more on , I mean 4 pieces of spinach?????? This lady needs to retire and go back to working at walmart or being a porter . Other Mexican guy that works there is really good though but this lady ruined this subways review .

Lets just say she pissed me off to the point where I downloaded this app, signed up and wrote a review. This isn't the first time this lady SUCKED  at her job. Every time I come here I hope the other guy is there."}
{"text":"Very clean place to grab a quick lunch.  I had the new bbq sesame pork sandwich and it was very good.  The people that work here seem friendly and clean.  Typical Subway."}
{"text":"Simply the worst Subway I have ever been to the Staff were fine but the prices at this location were extortianate, simply taking advantage of tourists. The mcdonalds right next door has regular mcdonalds prices so go there instead of this subway location. $13 for a Foot long sandwich is stupid, doesn't matter if it is on strip Fast food prices should always remain Fast food prices."}
{"text":"I live just across the street so it is always a go-to fastfood option for me due to the short commute. This subway is probably one of the best of the franchise branches in Toronto. It is a clean store with friendly staff and no cranky workers. Considering the fresh food and charming smell of freshly baked buns during the lunch hours, I would say that you would leave this location with a pleasant and filling feeling!"}
{"text":"Bad food ,bad customer service lady always in bad mood always rushing to get your food done even tho is empty in their"}
{"text":"Super nice guys that worked there! Super patient with their customers! Usually you feel rushed and awkward, but the two guys working when I was there just now were awesome!"}
{"text":"This particular Subway isn't my favorite. Every single time I've gone (mind you, I've been there A LOT since it's near me), the customer service is horrible. They aren't very friendly at all. It basically ruins the entire experience for me. I only like this Subway for the chocolate chip cookies and the cleanliness. That is it!!"}
{"text":"I love subway food.i usually come here because it is within my walking distance from home.i give it a 1 coz today when I went to check out the lady attendant literally slide my food forcefully towards me.what the hell!!!! I pay here for my food not to see ur attitude girl.."}
{"text":"This place us disgusting. It looks like it has never been cleaned. The ice dispenser has mold inside of it, the bathrooms are a mess. The tuna has a horrible dead fish taste. Worst Subway ever. There are too many Subways in the area to settle for this."}
{"text":"Just wasted $8.50 on a salad. Was eating my double chicken chopped salad (wasn't chopped at all) when all of the sudden I bit down on something really hard. Spit it out, checked the napkin.. Sure enough a BONE in my salad!  I threw away the salad after that. Will never return to this location unless they get rid of their careless employees."}
{"text":"this is more of a customer service issue for me, now so far since i been coming to this location customer service has been good in the morning and in the afternoon they're cool lol. But whoever the bald guy is who works nights needs some sleep or something, I don't know what the hell his issue is but he always has an attitude when i come in."}
{"text":"Typically consistent, Subway sandwiches. For a period of time they were inconsistent (aka, skimping) on the amount of toppings, but that seems to have stopped (otherwise this would be a scathing review).

Staff is usually friendly, competent. Its a chain, so its hard to judge selection. However, thus far they've always had whatever specials Subway offers. Pricing feels high, but I'm not sure if that's a Subway thing or if each location can adjust its menu. Drink machine has issues whenever I use it, so spring for a bottled drink."}
{"text":"The service was pretty choppy and the sandwich tasted okay but it wasn't very consistent all the way though and there is no bathroom to wash my hands. Granted they are open 24 hours at this location which is helpful to the night owls, this location could work on making the product more consistent, so that every bite was like the last."}
{"text":"As I was walking in, I noticed an employee sitting at a table eating by the window, and I told my boyfriend who was with me, \"I hope she isn't making our sandwiches.\" Sure enough...without a \"welcome\" she heads to the back through the door and comes around to the food area and slides her gloves on. She asked, \"How can I help?\" as she cleaned her teeth with her tongue - making that horrible smacking noise. Oh my goodness. And I told her we had a coupon for buy a footlong and large drink get 1 free. She replied with, \"Let me see that.\" with an attitude as if I was lying. I handed it to her and she read it out loud, sighed, handed it back to me and asked what bread I wanted. At this point I should have walked out, but I was curious as to how she would complete my order so I continued with my order. I asked if she could put the sides in a small container since I would be saving the other half of the sandwich for lunch tomorrow (didn't want it to get soggy) and she told me no, and that I'd have to buy the container. Well that's not true because I am a regular Subway customer at different locations and not once have I even been questioned on that. So I told her she could stick it in a cup. She gave me this horrible look and grabbed a cup. Remember guys, I ordered a footlong. She put literally 4 small pickles in a cup. Um okay, even for a 6 inch, 4 pickles isn't anything. I asked for her to put a little more she literally put \"a little more.\" So I had a footlong with about 6 pickles. Thank goodness I had pickles at home. After she rings everything up she hands us the bag and tends to a customer behind us. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT TO YOU TOO. My receipt says her name is Lonna, but there were 2 girls in there so I'm not sure if it was the rude one or the other one who was kind of standing there. Either way, customer service is horrible there, and you might as well take down all the \"Were hiring\" signs because no one is going to want to work there...which is probably why you're hiring the first place."}
{"text":"Horrible experience every day they give you less and less food and not only that the short span... lady who works there is VERY VERY RUDE with us  she never says hi she always has a negative attitude, she is more than awful. Owners should pay attention to this because in the future they will lose more  customers."}
{"text":"Sorry I mean subway located in 10470 W Cheyenne Ave, Ste 155, Las Vegas, NV 89129
Summerlin the crazy lady is more than awful in this location ."}
{"text":"Not all Subways are created equal.  I love the tuna salad salad and order it quite often.  I've ordered it in Chardon and Mentor on the Lake both in person and on the app with no issues.  Chardon pointed out that the descriptions are not what they should be on the app.  For instance, I love black pepper and green peppers hate me.  The app only says Pepper when they print it out.  For the last two times (in one week), this particular Subway has messed up my salad.  The first time, there was no black pepper, no napkins and no sweet onion sauce. I had even made specific notes about two of the three on the app on my phone.  I looked before I left, quizzed them on not adding green pepper and had them fix the issues.  Today, I looked before I left and questioned them - no black pepper, which they added and they had added the sauce to the salad as they made it.  (soggy salad anyone?)  I came back to work and found that they had put green peppers instead of black pepper.  I took the time to pack it back up and take it back to the store.  There, the young lady listened and started making me a new salad. Then the manager came.  This is where it gets \"good.\"  In front of two other customers, he said to me at least twice, \"We will take care of you This Time, but we can't help what the app does.\"  He went on to say that I should use the notes.  I said I did on my order earlier this week and that order was Really Messed Up.  So I said, I didn't use the notes today.  He said, I know it had green peppers and I am going to look.  I didn't reply but I wanted to say, go right ahead - green peppers have hated me for my whole life and I am an Expert at removing them from any given order anywhere.  I was allowed to make my own drink earlier in the week and that is good because I like extra ice.  I can't think of a time when Subway had my drink ready.  My drink was ready today, with very little ice and a full sweat on the outside of the cup.  The guy tried to say he made it five minutes before.  Not only am I writing a Yelp review, I fully plan on giving my opinion on Facebook, Next Door and Subway Corporate.  Wrong is wrong mister.  The customer is always right and in this case, I was really really right."}
{"text":"Used to be a daily customer since my school was near there. Sometimes even twice a day...UNTIL I got food poisoned and ended up sick for a whole week. A few friends told me they had similar incidents, with one even ending up in the hospital.
I contacted the restaurant to complain but they kept denying or taking responsibility. Its been almost a year, never went back."}
{"text":"Great location!  Nice staff!  This school year, I took my special education students to this subway for a few field trips.  The staff was very accommodating to my students various needs.  They were also patient when taking my students orders.  The food/toppings are fresh."}
{"text":"The staff here finally looks like thry're having some fun.  I've had lackluster experiences at this location in the past. But today was just fine.  I think they finally remodeled too.  It looks really modern."}
{"text":"Extremely small portions!!! Rude service and don't even think about asking for onions, pickles or cucumbers....you'll get 3. It will be the smallest sandwich for $9.00. Worthless, walk a bit further to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Brand new so everything looked great and food is up to par. Service is kind of slow as I wrote this review while waiting. Hopefully this will not be the norm."}
{"text":"I'd give this location 5 stars if it wasn't for the insane chick that works there, Christy. She visibly makes customers uncomfortable and brings up personal topics regarding her life and theirs. People just stand in line and shake there heads at her behavior so I know it isn't only me. My coworkers and I go there for lunch as we work very close and we pretty much pray before going in that she won't be working. I'm always friendly to people serving me food and waitresses however, she makes me feel odd and just want to get out. The other folks there are friendly and pleasant in the appropriate ways. She's just too much."}
{"text":"Do your self a favor and go to the new Subway on E 14th near the US Bank Building. As a previous reviewer stated, this place is very ghetto. I had the same experience of two employees going at each other and screaming F bombs. This one could close down and no one would miss it."}
{"text":"The man who served me did not make eye contact and was not friendly. If you're looking for good customer service I do not recommend this subway. I would drive the extra mile to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came into the establishment during the week and it was about 8 pm. You could tell that they had not been keeping up with their cleaning. I went to the counter to order, they told me that they did not have any meatballs  prepared for the meatball sub, they were out of a specific bread and lastly they did not have any guacamole prepared . I was very dissatisfied with the lack of of food because it wasn't that they were busy or that they were actually out of meatballs. It was that they did not care enough to have their crew have the food prepped and ready to go. I made a formal complaint the next day and was told that it was going to be handled . This happened in the beginning of September, I finally received an email inn October stating that they spoke to me, apologized and that I was given a replacement. These were all lies and I was forced to contact the corporate office again to inform them that the store was attempting to make their customer complaint go away by creating lies. It was finally taken care of days later and was given excuses as to why there was a \"miscommunication\". I personally would not recommend going to this specific Subway restaurant."}
{"text":"This was a convenience store Subway, however our sub was top notch and the staff were super friendly. She made our sub just the way I like it with all my rules about half of it for me one way and then the other half for hubby. They had a special on grilled turkey, everything was so fresh and plentiful. Great sub, sweet and efficient staff, exacts what we needed while having a long drive ahead."}
{"text":"Could they have hired a staff more rude & impolite? Doubt it. This is worst subway location you'll probably ever visit as the woman are awful and slow. They are extremely unpleasant and you can tell they strongly hate their job. Really not a nice place mostly thanks to the terrible staff. Honestly just to visit the location once & you'll see it's pretty terrible."}
{"text":"It's  a subway!!! Wooooaaah..meatballs sub everytime..I would go for the white macadamian and almond for the win.."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had! Not to mention I waited 20 minutes in line behind three other people while one person helped everyone, then when the last person behind me was finally up, 3 other staff members walked out from the back....if I did this to the client at my job I would fired."}
{"text":"Excellent staff and food, consistently good and I've come here regularly for the last four years"}
{"text":"I'm only giving it one star because I can't give it no stars. Sat in the drive thru for 10 mins placing my order for them to come over the speaker and tell me drive thru is closed and I have to come inside. I come inside and wait for another 5-7 minutes for them to put onions on some bread and then toast it. Once the one out of three people in the store finally ask to take my order, they tell me they have one 6\" bread or flat bread! Completely rude employees that could have cared less about helping. Will never be back to this crap hole."}
{"text":"Walked in here and it was empty. That should have been a clue to leave. There is one employee working here on a monday night. He was very dry and not welcoming. A line quickly formed behind me. Anyways I asked him if the bread was soft and he said it was. Upon getting home, the ends were crunchy and flaky. This was on a non-toasted sandwich. They were out of pepper jack cheese. Ridiculous! 

My footlong meatball was good except for the one burnt old meatball! We won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"This subway is much better than the ones in the east valley. Food is always fresh. Fast and courteous service. I've been here a handful of times and Jeremy seems to always be there. Super nice and calmly handles the the rush."}
{"text":"i love Subway. i really do. usually its fast, healthy, and one of those work lunches that doesnt make you want to curl up under your desk and take a little nap during the afternoon. 

i do not love this particular Subway. they are ridiculously slow. i dont know whether its due to the fact that employee's aren't quite seasoned or if they just dont care. they also have a strange assembly line thing going on. one guy does bread/meat cheese. one guy does some of the veggies and the last guy puts on your 'sauce'. this creates a giant cluster if one of the guys asks you a question that doesnt apply to his section. that means the next guy is going to ask you the same question again or he'll lean over and ask the first guy. well, thats even if the first can remember the sandwich he's making after youve told him for the fourth time.

i can deal with the lack of efficiency and the very distracted sammich makers, but i really wasnt a fan of the cashier who decided to bring up the latest tragedy in Tuscon and give me her whole opinion on the situation. i just stared at her blankly and prayed to the cashier gods that the register wouldnt break. i just want my damn sammich, not a lesson in political leanings. thanks."}
{"text":"It's Subway; I thought I knew what to expect. I ordered my meal and sat down to eat. Shortly after one of the employees started doing some sweeping with a broom and dustpan. Next thing I knew he was moving chairs away from the table where I sat and banging the chairs and table with the broom. He swiped his hand across the table as if to clean it and continued concentrating on sweeping at the table where I sat all the while telling me, \"That's okay sir.\" 

I think he was trying to drive me outside, which he eventually did. 

I like Subway, but I won't return to this one."}
{"text":"This location will close anyday. Bad service very rushed and can't count change. With all the other options, Firehouse subs is the place to go instead. Tip jar was empty....figures"}
{"text":"I have to give 5 here. But this is relative to other subways of course. I frequent this place as I live in the area and always get great service. Very fast and never had a bad experience with an order. Best sub shop in South Rosedale. Well ok, maybe it's the only one."}
{"text":"I dinged this Subway in my last review because the bread didn't appear to be fresh. Today I ordered my sandwich toasted. What a difference! Totally different texture for the better."}
{"text":"Someone, somewhere is making a lot of money off this Subway shop, but I'm certain it's not the employees. The employees who helped me did not have very seasoned customer service skills, but I think some are struggling to learn English. And my infested brain forgot most of my Spanish, so I couldn't help them, either. I paid $9 for a turkey salad that was fine, but I couldn't help wondering who was making all the money on the backs of the well-meaning employees and starving customers."}
{"text":"Ordered the Orchard Chicken Salad.  It was good.  This location didn't stand out from the other Subways that I've been to."}
{"text":"Horribly slow during lunch hour! They need to train their employee's to pick up the pace"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews on large chain restaurants but I saw a lot of negative reviews on both Yelp and Google. I believe some of them paint an inaccurate picture of this Subway. 
To start off, yes the service isn't the greatest, however, it lives up to the standard service you receive at most large fast food chain restaurants. I have been going to this Subway for a few weeks now when I am on the go and never had any problems. Most of the time that I have went in, the service is actually really quick, which I can appreciate because sometimes those Subway lines can take forever lol. The entire store is normally super clean. The tables are all whipped off, no spilt drinks near the fountain pop area, garbage has been taken out."}
{"text":"I go there at least once a week. Today I had the buffalo chicken sub, it was pretty good. The employees are very nice."}
{"text":"We love coming here.  We get sandwiches for my mother every weekend.  What makes this place extra special is their star employee, Araceli.  She's very helpful, kind, always smiling and makes the best sandwiches ever!!!  We will continue coming here because of her."}
{"text":"This Subway is very small and cramped, but you can't really give them trouble for that because it's a great location.  The service is what you would expect for fast food and there is usually a pretty long line up during peak hours such as lunch and the dinner crowd.

I come here for a quick bite after the gym and make sure to never sit down and eat as it is crammed inside.  Be sure to get your food to go and eat at the Starbucks next door after ordering a coffee.  At least there you have plenty of seating and free WiFi to boot!

The menu is typical of any Subway, but make sure to get the new avacado topping on your sub or salad.  Glad they finally added it in Canada, it makes a big difference in taste to any sub!  Overall i'll drop by here if I'm in a rush and have that sub craving!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to see all the bad reviews here. I have had nothing but amazing experiences and veggie delights every time I go! The staff are always friendly and serve you as fast as they can. I've been there for the lunch rush and my sandwich is always fresh and amazing ."}
{"text":"First time I saw a subway with a drive thru so I figured I would try it out... didn't get to order cause I was asked to hold and after almost 10 minutes ( 9 to be exact ) I decided to go... went to the location on Losee and centennial instead and was in and out in 3 minutes"}
{"text":"Went back there again because i brought my sons in for haircuts and hoped that things had changed with time. But no so luck. I cant believe that this Subway is still open. Terrible service and aweful subs made. Port of Subs is across the street."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Have been there a few times to grab a sandwich and staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Yes I am reviewing a Subway.  You know how when you have been to so many since they are pretty much everywhere and each of them are different in their own way but one stands out for many reasons; well this is that one to me.  I think it is the cleanest, freshest and friendliest in the Valley!  Since I work in the area I frequent there a lot mainly because it is NOT fast food.  What I love is that everyone behind the counter says \"hi, welcome to Subway\" as soon as anybody comes in and they say it with meaning, not because they have to.  It is small so it is always busy at lunch but they get everyone in and out of there quickly as they are appropriately staffed.  The bread is never dry (that says a lot in itself when it comes to Subway), the ingredients are always fresh and they have spinach as an option instead of plain old iceberg.  I can't begin to tell you how well kept this place is, right down to the restrooms even!  An added bonus is that it is open 24 hours.  Now I haven't been there late at night but I can bet that isn't an issue.  This Subway gets my vote for best in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Just got me a bacon avocado and turkey sandwich on flatbread. They put the avocado so thin that you could barely see it with the naked eye. Not worth 10 cents and they charge you a dollar. If you want to good sandwich where they don't skimp on toppings go to firehouse. It seems like the longer subway is around the cheaper they get on meet and cheese."}
{"text":"Today the nicest young man named Landon served my mother and I. He was patient as we fumbled over our order and graciously checked us out all while working to keep the growing line running smoothly. Thanks for a great experience Landon!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Subway to visit.  My three boys ask to come here all the time - and we do.  It's always clean and the food is very fresh.  Of course we love all the Subway choices.  This Subway always seems to have fresh cookies which is probably why my kids like it so much.  We like it more than the Subway at Walmart."}
{"text":"Not only is this place dirty, they are ALWAYS out of everything. You want Italian herbs and cheese bread? Too bad. Did you want avocado on your sandwich? Not here. 

Oh, but what they do have is tons of bad attitude from the red head cashier."}
{"text":"Just walked out of the store and the guy who helped us was okay. He made our food quickly and we were in and out in no time. He wasn't much for conversation or had very friendly customer service but that doesn't really matter to me. However customer service is key and I know a lot of people look for this in a restaurant  so I give this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"You know what? I don't understand all the subway hate on here. It's without a doubt one of the healthier fast food options out there. Service is fast and friendly, no muss no fuss. Sure it's not the best sandwiches out there. But price is right and where else will you find a deal like three large subs for twenty dollars? Nowhere. I had there steak a cheese sandy and it was mouth watering good..they have great combo deals too.."}
{"text":"This subway doesn't rush on making your sandwich, even when it's busy but they make sure it is done right and with lots of toppings. They literally make your sub like it's in the picture."}
{"text":"The employees are so friendly and hard working! Keep it up! The store is very clean... I love subway sooooooooo much!!! :)"}
{"text":"Waited in line patiently and then the employee completely skipped me and began taking the orders of the customers behind me. She didn't even apologize, just waved her fingers at me saying it would be a couple of minutes before she could get to me."}
{"text":"Tiny little kiosk subway at Bloor. I came at dinner time on Friday and there was only one employee and three customers. It meant that the sandwiches took a bit of time to make. I can only imagine what it would be like during a lunch rush...."}
{"text":"What was I doing at a Subway after all these years of avoiding this chain? Well, they now have real carved turkey and that was enough of an upgrade to get me in the door. On the 6 inch sub they give you two very nice pieces of that carved turkey and you know the rest. The sandwich was under 5 bucks and the chipotle sauce gave this item a good flavor. Subway will never be my first choice, but now at least they have an good option to go inside and some real meat finally."}
{"text":"I am giving this subway location five stars! This is because I have gone to this location for a long time and I have seen the changes since they got a new manager.  This store is clean and the food seems fresh.  I am vegetarian so when I ordered a veggie sandwich previously, I would have to make a fuss to actually get veggies!! Seriously I just get veggies! Now with this new manager...I actually get full from my sandwich! This is the only location I can get the (sorry don't know what it is called) mix of jalapeños and peppers...so tasty! Avoid the long lines and order online"}
{"text":"My husband  and I must eat at this Subway at least 2-3x per week and we usually order the same thing every time.  Daisy always goes above and beyond with service and has our order memorized.  She is always very friendly and the store is clean.  Probably one of our favorite Subways in Vegas.  Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Just stopped here.   I always drive by this location and thought why not spend my money here too. I love subway. 

Ahhhh bad slow service.   The guys working were very bothered that they had to get up. Put there phones down and build sandwiches for my family.  

No second chances.  Cross this place off the list.  Drive a little further to Middleton on Murphy."}
{"text":"The place is clean and updated. The service was excellent. I got a spicy Italian six-inch with almost everything on it piled high and it was very satiating. They have private parking and this is also the first subway I've seen with a drive through. Everything you expect from a well maintained and well managed Subway. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"\"6 inch tuna on white bread, with everything including spinach, but NO pickles\".

Not even joking, this THE only subway that ever gets my sandwich right. Thank you for the $5 meal deal, it beats the other chains in this shopping plaza as far as price for lunch."}
{"text":"The young men working behind the counter obviously took pride in their work.  The gentleman who made my sandwich, made sure it looked picture perfect and was very cautious with my chili pepper allergy.  Lots of personality.  It was fun to watch.  The ingredients were all fresh and crisp, the bread was soft and delicious.  Very happy to make this post."}
{"text":"When a customer ask for napkins it is possible they need more than the two you so kindly reminded me were in my bag. (Rude). It just so happens that YOU over filled my drink and it spilled. But I won't let your poor interactions with your customer navigate my day.  The one star rating will let my people know;)"}
{"text":"We had great service here on 3/13/17, around 6 pm. The two girls working were awesome and super nice, which is somewhat rare for a subway these days. Highly recommend this location! Thanks for great service last night!"}
{"text":"The service here is good, everyone is so friendly! I normally have bad experiences with Subway, so the fact that I keep going back to this one, says something. I also love that they're basically next door from my job"}
{"text":"Does not honor National Sub Day offer. They tell you JUST as you are about to pay. Too late to back out. WTF?"}
{"text":"I've never had better service at a subway in my life. Dustin the night shift worker was slammed but so polite and fun with every customer in line and made sure you knew he appreciated your patience. Such and awesome guy !!"}
{"text":"So this is my go to spot ... never had an issue.
I went in there to order for myself, daughter and granddaughter.

For my granddaughter who is only 2 my daughter asked for an assorted - I assumed it was a childs meal.  I was told that the childrens sandwiches are not available and he directed me to the board where I could see the sandwiches available.
I asked him the difference from a kids sandwich to a 6 inch... he told me the kids sandwiches are only 4\".
He already had a bun on the counter, before he started preparing it I asked him if that was a 4\" or 6 in.  
His response was, omg give me a break are you kidding me? Very derogatory - as I watched the beads of sweat almost falling off his face.
I asked him, I beg your pardon - did you just speak to me like that? How dare you speak to me in that manner I was asking a question.
He points at the manager and then to me and went on to serve someone else.

The manager let me know this is the owners son -lets guess 55 years old???? 
Not a teenager grow up ... you have now lost our business Mr. Sub is the same distance from our home."}
{"text":"What do you want from a Subway shop?  You know the product you're getting, so you want good service, and you want the people to properly make the sandwich.  We all know what it's like when you get a Poor Sandwich maker -- not enough toppings, too much sauce, poorly sliced bread.  It's an issue.

Everytime I go in this location, the staff is friendly and efficient.  It gets really busy, but they do a good job of keeping things running smoothly.  They always make my sandwich well, package it well, and I never regret my decision to have gone in there.  One of the better Subway locations in the downtown core."}
{"text":"It's Subway, so you know what you are getting.  The service is pretty fast, the food has always been fresh, and the employees have been friendly.  That's more than you can expect from most fast food places.  It's rarely busy in the evenings so that is the perfect time to get your food without having to wait.

Spicy Italian and Meatball Marinara are excellent.  And Italian Herbs and Cheese bread or flat bread are where it's at.  Anyone who disagrees is misguided :-D"}
{"text":"The only employee on duty was outside, vaping and on the phone. I seemed to be an inconvenience to her, and she was in no hurry to get back in and behind the counter.  It took her longer to make a sandwich than it would have taken me to make 10, and the bread was stale.  I don't expect the moon and the stars at the local subway, but I do expect a sandwich made with a certain amount of alacrity."}
{"text":"I just wanna know why  is it that everytime I go outside of the Bay Area I always get the option of pepper jack cheese?!?!?!
Don't they know that's what makes the sandwich?!?!?

But I thank and LOVE those that do!!

Team Pepper Jack cheese! :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the chopped chicken salad today and every piece of chicken was like chewing a little inner tube for a bicycle.  Lots of gristle also.  I threw the salad away because it was nasty.  I will never eat at Subway again.  The employees also are not very good a customer service."}
{"text":"Nice outside seating! But seriously subway makes the worst chicken. I'm really not picky about what goes in my mouth but wow I almost threw away my chicken salad."}
{"text":"What separates this subway from others is the warm, friendly staff that make you feel at home. Clean , safe area with lots of parking."}
{"text":"Correctly update your hours.  I work 2nd shift at the Capitol and I am tired of showing up there on weeknights between 7 and 8 pm and the restaurant being closed.   Nobody usually answers the phone when you are open, so calling to check first doesn't work either.

Update (2/6/16):  Just went there today at 4:40 PM on a Saturday to get a sandwich.  Completely closed down and dark almost 2.5 hours before their posted closing time.   Wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"Napkins are more important than customer satisfaction.  I live across the street and have been going here everyday if not every other day for the past 6 months. (I work from home) I continued to go after you raised your prices and was going to continue to go.  But after today something so silly as napkins is the reason I will never step foot in your subway again.  Thanks for forcing me to go grocery shopping!  FYI your .25 cents worth of napkins just cost you $5.94 x 30 days = $178.20 month.  over the next 6 months $1,069.20 and $2,138.40 over the next year. & 1 bad review never to be reversed.  I hope it was worth it..."}
{"text":"I don't normally do this but the time spent in line was ridiculous. My wife only gets 30 minutes for lunch and spent 20 of it waiting for 4 subs in front of her to be made. One person on the register with another doing all the subs and I think she was new cause she was moving very slow!!! To make matters worse, there were at least 3 other people coming out from the back, washing their hands, and then returning to the back. Who's actually managing this place???"}
{"text":"Super fast lunch service. The sub was great and great. I had the spicy Italian it was fresh and priced great for lunch. I highly recommend this Subway as it was clean, fast and friendly staff."}
{"text":"As a typical man I have had many a meal standing over the sink, evolution if you ask me, that being said I love subway. I have never left unsatisfied,  all bases are covered and I put them over the \"other place\" in Vegas. It's a shame about Jarrod but it will not stop me from returning. Had lunch there today,  might go again tonight,  for reals."}
{"text":"I found a piece of chewed gum in my salad and when I went to return it, there was no manager and no assistant manager on duty.  The employees didn't know what to do. I spoke to someone on the phone declaring to be a manager and said all they could do was to refund my order.  Then, when I got my reversal it was only for the salad and nothing else on my order even though I threw it all out.  DIRTY!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great subway.  Food is always fresh and tasty.  I worked for subway in ft Wayne in. In the 80s and this site reminds me of how good I was. Wes was my sandwich maker and did a fantastic job.  I will go out of my way to come to this store. Thx Dan."}
{"text":"This Subway has always been a little short on ingredients and very bad with the attitudes when you ask for more. Ordered a foot long tuna and when I asked for extra banana peppers you would've thought I asked for an arm or a leg. When I asked for more lettuce I was made to feel even worse. I also ordered a 6 inch meatball and when I asked for olives I got 4. Yes, 4 olives. Needless to say I didn't request more. On checkout I declined drinks and they asked me 3 times if I wanted drinks. 

Next time I'll drive to a different Subway!"}
{"text":"Live close and walk here and haven't had a problem until today. New guy was chewing tobacco while making my sandwich and it was all over his mouth. Super grossed out. Management and owner should be aware of this. Very unsanitary and just gross in general. Who chews tobacco anymore? And WHILE WORKING? Like I can't even. They lost my business"}
{"text":"I came in today and I was \"helped\" by a very rude young lady. I asked her what specific toppings were on the veggie delight because it's a default menu item and she responded \"veggies!\" I brushed her off the first time and asked if there were tomatoes on the sandwich and she responds rudely again \"veggies\" and is kinda laughing at me. Thought that was very unprofessional and I didn't appreciate her smart ass answers. Never gonna come into this one again."}
{"text":"Ordered online so it  would be quick and easy. Paid for everything with credit card, and went to pick up my food. First they tried giving us someone else's order. Then said they didn't have our order, never received it. Luckily they can't deny a confirmation number!  Yeah, these idiots are just completely incompetent. Won't be back to this location EVER."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here at the dinner hour 5pm and there has only been one employee. He's been great, but he needs a partner to help speed up service."}
{"text":"I work at one of the auto shops in the same shopping center so I go there about once a week. AJ is always in there smiling and chatting with the customers while he makes the sandwiches just how you want it. In addition the restaurant is always clean and the rest of the staff is always friendly as well."}
{"text":"The manager of this location simply does not care. Unfortunately I go back because of the convenience of the location. The manager never greets me, never thanks me, never smiles, and makes a barely acceptable sandwich. He puts forth the least possible effort and he is usually the one there making sandwiches during non-rush times. Most of the time he's not even wearing any sort of uniform. How does one forget tomatoes? And how does one wrap a sandwich so tight the sub bread ends up looking like a wrap? You suck. My husband told me there was a \"for lease\" sign in the window today and I have to be honest--I'm glad."}
{"text":"Subway is everywhere. Whether you want a nice meal or just something to go, your best bet could be at your local subway restaurant shop. Sandwiches are very good and convenient. Subway is spot on for that. 

I thought that, being that Subway is a national fast food chain, everyone will love them for what they sell, but they're are those who will just have their way with McDonald's and Burger King. With that said, I came here in search of sustenance when I was here is Scottsdale, Arizona on a nice September 2016 trip. I thought that I already had filed this review on yelp, but apparently I did not. Forgot that I did and I am doing it now, three minutes later and December 2016. I found this subway restaurant in Scottsdale Arizona near my hotel room on North Scottsdale Avenue. It was about 3 clicks above the rebranded Ramada hotel and suites, so I got to hang out here for a quick dinner option for my last hours before leaving metro Phoenix area to fly back to Honolulu the next morning. You can always spot subway restaurants by its logo and its characteristic physical outward app, so you know that you can get a healthy-ish sandwich with minimal fuss and expense here at this subway. The overall experience here at Subway in Scottsdale, Arizona was genuinely a good one. Standard fare with the stuff you've come to know and love already makes this place a great option for y'all on the go or have health goals to shoot for. 

Whether or not you look to Subway to help kick start your weight loss endeavors, Subway can be your source for good food, healthy food, and just a better way of looking at eating and living healthy. This subway restaurant location is located at 999 Main St. here in Scottsdale, Arizona. They said major credit cards, which is always a great thing. Only thing is that this location is pretty much at A gas station. It doubles with a mini mart, so you can get your trays of a sub sandwich and other things here, with getting a tank of gas for your vehicle. While there are parking spaces nearby due to the fact that it is near a shopping strip mall, you are prime to get a good spot here to get her subway sandwich fix on. The prices here at Subway are very reasonable and quite good for 5 to 6 dollars per foot long. Any extra ions and cookies and chips are always extra. They have combos for the 6 inch high they have daily 6 inch subs of the day too.

This subway location was as good as it can get, just because it was close enough to my hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona. So I did not have to drive so far to get food, or even look for it. Subway is one of your best bets for reasonable, cheap, and budget friendly. This one is clean and, while it is in a gas station mini mart, you can get other stuff too, while purchasing gasoline for your car. The service here at this Subway location in Scottsdale, Arizona was as good as you can get. Friendly and fast. Thinking more or less than what is required. I had the spicy italian foot long sub, with extra cheese and advocado. I didn't feel like adding bacon to it would be good, so it was like that. Add all of the vegetables with pepper and oregano, no vinegar or oil and I was good to go. I ended up having it as a meal, with cookies and a large soft drink. It was an epic end to a short vacation that took me to the east coast for a couple of marathon races then here to the southwest for a quick trip to see the Grand Canyon. This took place in late September 2016 and happy with how it turned out. Subway is awesome for what it does. Healthier eating doesn't have to be hard or challenging when you have Subway to do the prep work for you.

4.0 stars for the service. 4.0 stars for the food. 4.0 stars for the overall experience. It's cool, yet average at the same time. Nothing eventful happened here. Just get in and out without fuss or drama.

Support local!

{"text":"So hungry after a long day at work so I stopped here for a quick sub on my way home... With only 1 person ahead of me waiting to order and a couple that was already getting veggies it didn't seem like it would take that long. I waited approximately 15 minutes just to start ordering my sub. Then the lady who was making my sub was so distracted talking to other customers that I had to repeat nearly everything. The reason it took so long to start my sub however, was because the girls working here we're deep in conversation with the couple at the front of the line. I mean talking about makeup and eyebrows and who cares what fuck else...when I walk into subway I'm looking for a quick sandwich and leave. I wasn't the only unhappy customer who waited either."}
{"text":"Ok... we all know that subway is just a sandwich place..nothing fancy...but this review is mainly for the SUPERB OUTSTANDING SERVICE.  It was almost 9:25 and the dining room closes at 10. Then it is only drive thru.  Anyway there were ALOT of people in there and only one employee..Carrie was her name..and she did an amazing job making everyones order..and doing drive thru with soooooo much efficiency And a great attitude that nobody seemed to mind the lengthy wait.  I know it is fastfood but this employee should be recognized and rewarded  for being an invaluable asset to them.  She really was that good.

I hope that subway takes the time to read this and realizes what an asset they have in CARRIE!!!!!!"}

{"text":"Standard subway close to Ryerson University. Never really that busy so decent place if you don't want to try the lines at the Eaton Centre Food court."}
{"text":"Invert disappointed ...I order a sandwich and made it deluxe and they still have me the same amount of meat for a original sandwich ... I asked for basically all the veggies on it and I had no lettuce ! A few leafs of spinach and they put 4 tomatoes on my whole sandwich .  When I regularly go into the restaurant they give you a sprinkle of the veggies not just an amount where you can count .. I asked for banana peppers and there in none on the sandwich .. I also asked for my bread to be toasted ... I feel like they took it out fast or never even toasted it because I went in the drive thru . This subway has low ratings and I just tried calling to speak to the manager about a refund or something because of my satisfaction , no one answered!  I will try tomorrow but this is Terrible for the amount of money I paid for"}
{"text":"Attention franchise owner. This place is out of control. Counter was unattended when I arrived with several customers yelling hello hello and rattling the door chimes for a long time. We could clearly see someone sitting in the back. I didn't even bother sticking around because I had weird problems last time I was here. Won't be back. Dangerous patterns being noticed. That's what you get with slave labor I guess."}
{"text":"THE WORST SUBWAY EXPERIENCE EVER!

First off the employees at this franchise are EXTREMELY RUDE!!!! (And that's an Understatement!)
 I asked about the combos, both workers behind the counter looked at me at kept going about their business, not even a (I'll be with you sir in a moment) - nothing,
 I asked again, they ignored me and kept on talking to each other ignoring me. 
 I stood their at the counter and looked at them until they acknowledged me,  finally an employee came over and helped me. 
 I ordered a 12 inch sub, I asked for NO Ham on my club, another worker piped in and said \"That Will Be $2.50 Extra.\" I said for what, he said for \"adding meat\" I said, I'm not adding meat, I simply don't want the Ham, then said very rudely \"I cannot do that, it cost us more for that\" ... I have to charge Extra $2.50!\" (with his very thick accent,  and I don't think he or the other employee understood English very well, all I wanted the Club Sandwich without the Ham)

 I asked one more time slowly and very clearly about removing the Ham, the same rude employee said the same thing again \"It will be 2.50! Extra\" with the same extremely rude tone, then he and the other employees were talking about \"damn customers\" right in front of me even while I stood there paying, pissed off I felt like yelling at them, however I was so mad I just payed and left pissed. Leaving this store I wondered, How in the hell does this place stay in business?
 
I WILL NEVER EVER GO TO THIS SUBWAY FRANCHISE AGAIN!

TO FRANCHISE OWNER:

1)  TEACH YOUR EMPLOYEES CUSTOMER SERVICE!

2)  TEACH YOUR EMPLOYEES TO SPEAK ENGLISH!

3)  THIS IS AMERICA - WE SPEAK ENGLISH! 

4) 1 - 3"}

{"text":"The mall closes at 7pm but the associates had everything put away when I arrived at 6:15pm. What's up with that? Maybe it was a sign from
the most high because my last visit I had to tell one of the cashiers about the flies in the cookies."}
{"text":"Well, it's Subway. I came here because I had to do laundry next door and the Filipino Buffet further down the stripmall wasn't looking so hot either.

I got the Cold Cut Combo and it was as good as a Subway sub gets. Bread was soft, meat was pre-packaged and the mustard wasn't watery. 

What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"It's subway, it's consistent, its cheap..."}
{"text":"I wanted a nice, filling sandwich on fresh bread.  I got it!!

The bread at Subway is good.  This subway has nice employees and is very clean.  There's always plenty of parking and the price is right.

They have a special of the day 6\" sandwich.  Also offered as a special is 12\" sandwich of the month.  It's always good!

So if you're in the mood for a sandwich and don't want to break the bank, try their daily special or 12\" hero of the month."}
{"text":"This subway actually charges the prices it advertises in front of the store unlike the other one nearby. I got a veggie pattie footlong for only 6 bucks. Great deal! Only thing I dont like is that they are very cheap with the sauce. He barely put any southwest sauce on it and I had to ask him to put more like 3 times to get just a regular amount. That aside I was happy with the price I paid and the food tasted good. I will come back."}
{"text":"I stopped by to use the bathroom and ended up getting a sandwhich since I could smell the food from the extremely clean bathroom they had. The smell was completely irresistable. I had to get the footlong veggie pattie with guacamole and a bunch of other veggies on it!! I always love me some subway. Good, clean location!"}
{"text":"Do not go here.  Unless you have 15-20 minutes to wait in line.  They take drive through orders above walk in traffic. When I asked why she's taking call orders in front of everyone, as it was the 6th sandwich made for them as I waited, she rudely replied \"it's a headset, not a phone\".  I then started to ordern, and she told me she was going to upcharge me for bacon...on the \"chicken bacon ranch melt\". Say what?  Is bacon not in the title of the sandwich?  That was my last straw, so I said forget it, and walked out and told her that is never come back. (To which she replied \"NEVER COME BACK\". ) The management must be terrible here to let this thing happen.  She should be fired immediately.  Don't ever go to this subway"}
{"text":"Unhappy, grumpy staff who move so fast half your sandwich falls out before they've even wrapped it. The mayo got stuck in the bottle and instead of taking a moment, she just shook it until it spurted out a huge blob on my sandwich - and then just kept squirting, not even spreading that big blob around.  I hate when you ask for \"lots of\" x, and they give you a tiny amount of x. Not worth the attitude when the Subway at Bay and Gerrard is so friendly"}
{"text":"I eat Subway at least three times a week for lunch. However I will never return to this location. The employees seem like they're there more to have a good time then to make sandwiches and the vegetables look like they have been out for days.  who wants a sandwich with brown lettuce. If you do I just found the restaurant for you."}
{"text":"We had a very great experience at the subway on N. 16th in Phoenix, the two young men who were working on this day were so polite, made our sandwiches exactly as we wanted them and they were great.  We will definately mention this to their GM, and people in the area should check them out.  $5 for a footlong, a great deal."}
{"text":"I don't normally go for \"fast food\" type breakfast, but I heard about the Subway breakfast offerings, so I was a little curious.  I stopped by on my way to work this morning to pick up a to-go order. 

The first problem is trying to get into this little strip shopping center on Conlan Circle during the morning rush. The problem is the Starbucks next door with a drive-through window.  Traffic backs up down the street for people trying to go through the drivethrough to get their caffeine fixes. When I finally made it to Subway, there were several other people in the store also picking up breakfast and I saw only 2 employees, so things were a little on the slow side. Employees were a little sluggish and not very helpful. (Maybe they should have stopped by Starbucks before they started their shift to get a big espresso.) 

The Subway breakfast options are pretty limited so I just ordered an egg flatbread melt with cheese.  It was not terrible, but certainly nothing I would go back for. By the time I got it to the office (just a block away) the egg was cold and I really couldn't taste the cheese. 

Next time I am in a hurry and want a \"fast-food\" b-fast, I'll just stop at the Chick-fil-A at Stonecrest.  Their egg & cheese on a multigrain bagel is much tastier and more convenient.  

If Subway wants to compete in the breakfast space against Chick-fil-a, Bojangles, and all the bagel places, they really need to up their game and offer something more compelling than what they have now."}
{"text":"Not sure what expectations people have with these chain establishments like Subway; however, I don't find a great difference between this location and others enough to count for much. The staff is great here and the sandwiches are just like any subway sandwich that I have ever had across this country."}
{"text":"I have worked at subway before this one is nothing special. When you first walk in you're lucky to get a greeting. They have little to no bread ready even at 11 o'clock. It's nice they hand out cookie samples but don't just throw it in our faces. Don't bother asking for extra toast since they will only role their eyes and give attitude. The only reason why I can to this location is because I had to hurry home to get a child from school. I rather drive 20 minutes to 107th Ave and olive rd they have amazing service and their place is clean. I also know that if I wasn't in a hurry I would've just let them have it. Also they don't let you tell them what you want they tell you as if you are incapable of using your words. I also know they have a huge turn around rate for employees. They need to train the employees on customer service I have half a mind to call corporate and have them check in on them."}
{"text":"I too will agree that they are a friendly staff, the place is clean and the service quick. And they still manage to make brief friendly conversation while doing their job. The food is fresh and they actually understand the concept of splitting a sandwich by cutting and wrapping the paper around two halfs! Can't say that they understand or care at other locations."}
{"text":"Subway is Subway, however they are pretty quick here.  The lines get pretty long here during lunch and they always filter your thru pretty fast.  The bread is actually always fresh, and not hard like some slower Subway's"}
{"text":"Sort of competent staff. Mostly hollow-eyed and dull. And whatever you do speak up about your sandwich,  they make them like the ingredients are coming out of their wage.  Ask for extra napkins,  they give you 1 one .....always"}
{"text":"Gotta love Subway."}
{"text":"The sandwich may be good and the restaurant clean but what would it happen if you need to use the bathroom ?? Good question !!! There is none  totally gross and not up to code ,, wonders how come city of Henderson allows them to do business!!!!"}
{"text":"Floors and tables dirty.  Same with bathroom.  Would not return.  I believe lack of adequate staff is basic problem."}
{"text":"Rude Employees - no Eye contact no personality no smile no hello no nothing , drones and robots would do a better job and you wouldn't expect any rapport or personality )an employee went outside to smoke in view of customers , this place must be making so much money that the franchise owner or company store manager doesn't care or feels the  need to train or supervise or be on site -- also the till cash register was down ( offline ) the spotty faced drone kid asked me for $9.00 ,, no please no thank you and I bet the $9.00 did  not go into the till once it came online again - as put the cash aside and not in the drawer - he took $1.00 out of the tip tray to give me change out of a ten . Again no thankyou's  for coming in no have a crappy day no nothing -- maybe automation is best for these non personality millennials ,"}
{"text":"I asked for light mustard and Delvin over did it.  I asked him to take some of it off and he looked at it like how? I just told him take of the first layer and he did with his glove n it got messy.  Then he stick his hands in the ingredient with the same glove full of mustard. Smh! Then he tells me i have to ask for light mustard i said excuse me? Yes I did you didn't hear me."}
{"text":"Worst service, no room to stand in line, and crappiest sandwich I've had in a while. 
For starters, the drive thru means there's only 4 parking spots for this tiny place. And once you make it inside, there's really only room for about four people to be in the building at one time- there are chairs and counters along the perimeter of the dining area for those who want to dine in, but there really isn't a way for people standing in line to NOT constantly bump into the seated diners. Bad floor plan.

Service was crappy and borderline nonexistent- I was asked what I wanted, and if I wanted it toasted, and if I wanted veggies, and then told my total. Employee was female and young and rude. After paying for my order, she handed me my receipt and walked off- no thank you or good bye, and she didn't even hand me my sandwich, which was practically behind the register. Awkward.

Add to this that there are several signs up promoting their jalapeno cheese bread, and they were out of it when I went in-- at noon on a Sunday. On top of that, when I finally ate my sandwich, there was hardly any meat on it and it was clumped in the middle with bites of bread and veggies at either end- of a six inch. 
Tried the chicken enchilada sandwich and it was underwhelming. I'm confident that I had around seven Fritos in the entire sandwich, and I am not sure whether she forgot to include sauce on my sandwich or chose not to put it on- because it was really dry."}
{"text":"Just horrible. Don't know why I even stopped in to give them another shot, other then its been years since I've tried them.

So many great options for a great sub, or deli type sandwich in this area now.

However, since its been awhile and I found myself in their parking lot, hungry and pressed for time, I figured they can't be any worse then I remember, so in I went.

Yep, somehow they are worse. Thats a tough feat considering they were horrible a few years ago. At or near the point when one wonders who the heck would eat there.

I got 2 subs. I really should have just walked at without ordering once I saw the state of their old/wilted veggies. But I didn't. I then should have walked out as I watched them prepare my 2 subs and saw the sorry state of the meat (as if they couldn't easily tell by looking, they sat right there holding meat up to their nose to smell it, and kept tossing some pieces aside while putting the same nasty stuff on to the sandwich. They then did the same with the meatballs. One girl said 'throw them away'. The other girl said 'their fine', and proceeded to make the meatball sub)

What can I say, im a fool. I should have known better and walked out. I didnt. Thankfully however, both sandwiches went in to the trash. I didn't even try one bite of either. They were both absolutely nasty. 

I'd rather flush $15 down the drain rather then get food poisoning.

I fail to see why anybody would eat at this place. Even if you are hungry and pressed for time, there are far too many other options within 1-5 minutes. If you don't have 1-5 minutes, your better off going hungry.

Will never go back. They could offer me 10 free subs and I wouldn't even bother to take them and give to a homeless person. The food they are eating out of trash cans is better then this horribly nasty Cr*p."}
{"text":"I came here a few days ago, I ordered a footlong and a medium drink, i sat and ate there, when I went to refill my drink, manager tells me \"you cant just walk in and refill, i have to charge you for that!\" I told him yeah but i have already paid for it awhyl ago, he stares at me and ignores and goes at the back, Manager is rude ! Worst subway ever! Never expected that!"}
{"text":"Amy needs to get her ass in gear and make me some coffee, stat!"}
{"text":"Slow service. I'm watching this kid make my sandwich with the pace of a snail. He's waiting for the toaster to beep for the person behind me. Meanwhile my sandwich is just sitting there on the counter. The girl is just standing there. Doing nothing to help. Next time I should go to Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Pretty cookie-cutter Subway, which happens to be my go-to location, since it's a stone's-throw from my house.

I've eaten here many times, and have yet to be disappointed.

The meats and cheeses are kept fresh, as is the bread, the service is just fine, and they're never stingy with the toppings.

Nothing groundbreaking, but decent food in a pinch."}
{"text":"Staple inexpensive subs that are identical to those of every other subway in town
I wish they offered guacamole like their sf counterparts do"}
{"text":"One of the worst Subway locations to choose from. 
Their customer service it's not quite right absolutely not good, the dining area is filthy most of the time and for some reason the bread here tastes weird. 
I love subway but this is the first location where everything it's weird. 
I rather use their 24th st and McDowell location."}
{"text":"This is the worst Subway in Champaign-Urbana! Filthy, and the staff was bitching about the fact that he had to sweep the floor! I'll never be back, too many other options in town and close to this location. Ewwwwwwww!"}
{"text":"Went in there last week and dealt with a grumpy employee who was clearly miserable working there. The machines went down while trying to purchase my sub so myself and another customer waited for 20-25 mins to try and purchase our subs all to be told in the end that unless we had cash we could not take the food. Better to leave two pissed off customers and wasted food than to accommodate for the inconvenience I guess. Also another customer walked in while they were having technical difficulties and she stood there for about 5 mins waiting patiently and the two employees didn't say a single word to her. She eventually walked back out. Today I go in and there's only one employee making about 7 subs. I left for the 2nd time without a sandwich in hand. I'll drive the extra 5 mins to buy sandwiches elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Order a BLT with avocado which is an additional $1.50 when really i could get avocados for 50 cents each at the store across the street. Anyway I found a fucking hair in my sandwich!! A long thick coarse hair, all up in my spinach. This isn't the first time it's happened."}
{"text":"Good idea, BAD execution!!! Spent 15 minutes going through the drive thru. Not very convenient at all. Could barely hear the lady talking. Then, I had to reorder at the window because she didn't get anything right. First time using the drive thru.. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"This Subway is the one closest to where I live and where I work, so I frequent it often when I need a quick bite to eat.  I'm a big fan of Subway in general, the quality of their sandwiches is great for how cheap they are.  I can go to Subway and always know what I'm going to get and that I don't have to worry about it tasting good.

I see no reason to really review a chain as big as Subway on Yelp, however this specific location has compelled me to write a review.  This location is the best Subway I've been to.  Everytime I go, I am blown away by how friendly the staff is....every single one of them.  The lines at lunch are generally long and they get very busy, but not for a single moment do the employees lose their smiles.  It's pleasant going to a chain fast food restaurant and having such great service."}
{"text":"I usually love Subway, but this one in particular I had a terrible experience with. There were 6 people in line behind us (a party of 4) and the employee making our sandwiches was extremely slow and paid no attention to what we ordered. He some how mistook \"mayonnaise\" for \"tomatoes\". It was also very difficult to understand him as he spoke very softly. It took him over 15 minutes to make our 4 sandwiches, not to mention it took over 40 minutes to make sandwiches for the other 6 for the people behind us! One man walked in, waited 3 minutes, and quickly stormed out at the sight of the employee making the sandwiches so slowly. He was also the only employee in the restaurant, which should definitely not be allowed. I would probably not come again because of this disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We all know Subway: Eat Fresh!  Cheap sandwiches made quickly, 5 dollar foot-longs, etc.

The one thing I like about this Subway is the fact you can order and pay online, just show up, and pick up your sandwich.  Excellent for being on-the go, especially if you know you're going to be around that particular afternoon or evening to get your sandwiches for the family but are currently stuck in the office or what have you.  

Aside from that perk, the interior is clean, there are usually ample tables, the staff has been there for a while, they greet you pretty quickly.   

I took away a star due to the GM/owner, this kind of \"off\" older guy lecturing and kind of embarrassing one of his employees in front of the customer(s).  I thought that was really unprofessional and awkward to witness."}
{"text":"Expectations aren't too high for a 24 hour Subway within a casino, but perhaps if the employees weren't male and facing the screens of the sports book, service would be more attentive.

Visited this weekend while a major game was playing, wanting to grab a pizza- Subway pizza is delicious, try one if you haven't already.

Employee was polite but incredibly slow. Between carrying on a conversation with his coworker and staring at the game screen, the guy barely had the capacity left to focus on making my order. It was simple, too.

Received it finally, hot and delicious. Only complaint is that veggies were not chopped up prior to adding to the pizza- other locations have cut them into smaller pieces, as for the salads, before baking, but not here. Giant pieces of pepper and onion tore up the cheese as I ate my individual pieces."}
{"text":"This places sucks, worst subway I've ever been too. came here twice & they screwed up my order both times. Management needs to really work on this location because I will never come back here & I'm telling my friends & family about this horrible place too. What kind of subway has one person charging you, distracting you from telling the other worker what you want on your sandwich and the person who is making your sandwich wraps it up with out asking you if you are done with adding stuff to your sub?"}
{"text":"This subway location is always very clean and the customer service is better than any other subway I've ever been at. TJ handles the people that work with him very well and they seem to be happy to work there. The veggie patty sandwich that I get I daily basis is always made to perfection. Thank you"}
{"text":"Place is small, services was quick, the standard you can expect from a Subway store.

Well...
The ice machine was not working (or not even turned on?)
The tables were not cleaned after the last customer left (for more than 15 minutes)
The only garbage can I can see is a really small one that you probably would put in a kids room.

I guess they meant to do take-out business only."}
{"text":"This location just opened up and is in the Antique Mall of America plaza.  Its open 24hrs and has a decent amount of seating and is really clean.  

I'm just happy that there is a new subway so close to my house now.  But it is just the run of the mill subway hence the 3 stars"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to stop and get some subs before we went to the park. We walked in and there were 4 people in line. The guy who worked there looked at us, started shaking his head and mumbled under his breath, we clearly were not wanted. We left to another subway and got great service. We will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Fast efficient service and the younger guy ringing us up was very friendly. Food is exactly what you would expect from a subway."}
{"text":"Don't go unless you want slow unclean service and food poisoning...I'm not joking! The girl doesn't wash her hands in between orders, after handling orders, handling  money and putting on plastic gloves. If you don't wash before putting on clean gloves then you defeat the purpose of clean gloves hence you open your customers up to getting bacteria, salmonella, E coli. Thanks Subway for giving me 4 days between my bed and my bathroom which has been since Saturday! I would have given it 0 stars but you can't."}
{"text":"This place has the worst help ever. Rude! Also, if you correct them when they are putting your vegetables on incorrectly, good luck! Only go here because it is close to my building."}
{"text":"In all fairness I don't like subway. The food is ok and the price is ok. I prefer Caprioti's or Port of Subs or just about anything else. The service at this location is ok... Overall. If your looking for a cheap sub this will do."}
{"text":"I'd give this place zero star if I could not from the taste of food but because I saw an employee come out of the back of store with a cigarette already lit, this happened 5 minutes ago, it's 11:08 right now. . Not only that, but she had the nerve to keep the back door open and she stood INSIDE the back of the place letting the smoke not only go outside, but go inside. She smoked her cig, checking her phone, and went inside without even waiting to let the smoke off her.  I saw this all while waiting at the Starbucks drive thru. That's just disgusting and I would not want that around my food."}
{"text":"Ordered the Turkey add pepperoni on white bread. Add tomato, onion, jalapeno, mayo, salt and pepper, with extra green peppers, just the way I like it. Sandwich artist was patient while I was being kinda difficult with my special order and extra questions. The shift leader who is always there it seems was busy finishing his sandwich but then was happy to help. Both guys have great customer service skills, and the sandwich was made nicely. I really appreciated the time (like 10 seconds) he took to explain the uncharges, which made me happy to pay $.30 to upgrade my drink to a bottle. Sandwich was fresh and hit the spot, ate every bite. 
Bonus Note: This location has the seafood sub which is bomb."}
{"text":"The owner was less than helpful on the phone today! I visit subway at this location often and have been told, a few times, that it's buy one get one sub all day Thursday (national sub day), even without coupon.  I told my friend so, as she went to pick up subs for our families. She got charged the original price with no discount because no one had mentioned it to her and she assumed it was going to be on reciept. I called and got questioned by the owner \"well did she get a soda?, did she ask for discount?  Was it this  location? \" She had purchased  $30 of subs and if she would've bought a soda she could've gotten the deal. He did say we could go back for A free sub ( really?? We bought 5)! When I'd asked who I was speaking to,  I could not believe it was the owner that was being rude to me! I work across the street in a big building and will be sure to spread the word!"}
{"text":"Always friendly, they always greets you, clean, lots of tables, right next to Bashas on 7th and Missouri.

You can Txt your order.  




Where some Subways dont, they accept the buy on get one coupons from the fund raising cards Subway gives for charities."}
{"text":"I didn't know Zootopia's DMV sloth had moved to TO! But there he was at Subway tonight. Yeah  I know, Subway is Subway so it's probably costing the poor guy money to work there at 10 pm. Plus they supposedly use weird preservatives in everything so we try not to eat there unless, like tonight, it's the only option. The guy working the late shift was really slow (did I make that clear yet?) and unhelpful/unhappy and didn't warm things up right and put barely any stuff on our sandwich. But he did know a lot about what had gluten in it, so that was impressive. Unfortunately we still left annoyed."}
{"text":"I have stopped at this location TWICE now for breakfast, once last week on Tuesday May 7th, 2013 at 7:48 am and again today Monday May 13, 2013 at 7:40 am and this location has been CLOSED both times. Their hours of operation are clearly posted on the door and on their website as 7:00 am to 10:00 pm. I would suggest with the amount of morning traffic and business that is driving right by that you either open when your hours state, or change the hours to reflect the hours you plan on being open."}
{"text":"We used to get food here for work. Let me just tell you that juggling multiple orders from a customer's perspective is a nightmare. That said, the great staff here would always put up with it and handle our giant orders patiently and very well. Occasionally, I'd run into the employee who'd randomly move subs around when I'm doing 4 subs at once (seriously, why the hell would you change the order while I'm doing this? Are you trying to ruin my order?!), but more often than not, they made my difficult job easy. 
And, you know, decent food for being so cheap. I'd rather eat at Silvermine or Jersey Mike's, honestly, but I ain't some rich pseudoscientific jerk like the Food Babe. Screw the Food Babe. Subway gets an extra star because I hate her so much."}
{"text":"Had a good veggie sub, fast, friendly service.   Wasn't busy at lunch had plenty of space to sit."}
{"text":"Cant beat $5 foot longs and the location is right outside AMC and Starbucks.  

Service is good.
Food is subway. 

Gets busy at movie let out times..... if you can work that out!"}
{"text":"I think things have changed.  im here on a thursday at 730 pm. Its busy... The veggies are good and the staff were good too.

A few tables havent been wiped, but there is a steady stream of people. 

Its a subway... Not the ritz."}
{"text":"No impressed. The girl behind the counter acted as if she hated her job and appeared to have no desire to be here. The sandwiches were nothing exciting. The girl \"sandwich artist\" couldn't skimp less if we tried. And $1.50 for avocado? Really? For four tiny slivers of avocado??? Give me a break.  And the high chair for my baby... There's no bar on the front of the high chair. My baby almost fell out as I tried to put her in. We won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Don't go here. They don't accept the new subway text coupons.  Won't ever get my business again."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. One of the reasons why I trust subway most of the time is because the make the sandwiches in front of you. I don't mind how long they last with each picky customer. And I understand you are in the rush to get everyone served but please wash your hands after a cash transaction if you are making me a sandwich. Uber grossed"}
{"text":"Can I even give negative stars? Let's begin with customer service. First of all, none of them greet you. Then they add on 3 tiny slices of onion and other ingredients for 6\" and I asked for a little more and they continue by adding one more tiny piece of vegetable. By the time we reach the cash register, the woman makes a big sigh opens both her hands and rests them on the counter as if she just went through a superficial procedure and has the audacity to give a death stare. This happened twice with an Asian server and this Indian woman. I will definitely not be going back. Plus the foot long I ordered the second time was made with stale bread."}
{"text":"I've never been treated more poorly in my life. I was not greeted when I entered but instead found two teenage girls showing each other their paychecks and complaining at the amount. I stood at the counter for a min and waited till they stopped talking. She finally took my order. I bought a meal, wasn't given my cup and when I went to get a drink they were out of ice so I asked if they could refill the ice machine. She literally rolled her eyes at her friend and walked to me and told me to take a bottle out of the basically empty refrigerator. I told her I wanted ice and she says (in the rudest nastiest tone) well you'll be waiting 20 minutes cause i have to go to Bashas and get it for you. I said you don't have an ice machine? She replies well its not working right now. Hmmmm.....I asked who is the manager? She tells me we don't have one! Really????? You don't have a manager? Nope. I asked the other worker is there a manager that runs this store? She says no and turns away from me to go in the back. DONT GIVE THIS LOCATION YOUR BUSINESS. I can't believe the lack of common courtesy and disrespect they treat their customers with. And no management in this place to manage these HORRIBLE employees. I'm just disgusted with how terribly I was treated. Beware."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. I waited 36 minutes with 2 people ahead of me and ended up having to walk out to get to work. 36 minutes. if you're going to only have 1 person maybe make sure he can handle making more than 2 sandwiches an hour. Definitely don't go to this location if you're looking for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"All Kosher meats and soy cheese only result in a very poor tasting Italian sub. Bread was fresh but staff flattened it during 'cutting' and building the subs was a chore. Unorganized and slow with bad tasting food. If you want real subway go to another location. Parking is far removed from restaurant as it is in JCC lobby."}
{"text":"The gentleman was cleaning up when I strolled up to the counter. He made sure to wash his hands before helping me. Always appreciated, even with the gloves.

There was a promotion for 6 inch that he applied to the footlong. I appreciated that little discount. The ingredients were fresh, place was clean.... that's all I expect at a Subway.

It's located inside a Walmart. The man helping me didn't provide a bag & napkins but I just put the sandwich in my Walmart bag and had napkins at home. No problem."}
{"text":"Monday Sept 18,2017 
I walked in to the store at 10:57 pm ordered a wrap, the clerk on shift never said boo to me, I started by saying I wanted a chicken wrap, he didn't ask me once what I would like on it. He kept on looking a note one the front of his counter how to make it. I kept on having to say add this and add that. He asked me to go I said no I'm going to eat in. He told me I can't cause he is closing at 11. I question him and said your sign says 11:30. He said you can't the time I clean up its 11:30. I said to him so your forcing me to eat in my car seeming your sign says 11:30. I said I will talk to someone about this. As I was walking out him and another customer started laughing about me. I looked back through the window I've never been so humiliated and embarrassed in my life over a sandwich. I will never go back to that store"}
{"text":"Friendly service and generous with their coupons.  I stopped in and got 2 subs and was greeted as soon as I walked in and was served promptly and courteously."}
{"text":"$6.22 out the door for a Black Forest Ham Footlong. Not my favorite sandwich place, but Subway is like the McDonald's of the sandwich world - always consistent so I always know what I'm getting for the price. This location is always friendly fast, and rarely crowded. They're 24/7 and take orders from the app as well."}
{"text":"I just called this location to order a platter for tonight. I have family coming in on no notice and thought \"Hey, lets do some meet and greet snacks!\" After about 20 rings someone answered. I said I wanted to order a platter for tonight and they asked me to hold. No problem...3 minutes later...no problem.....5 minutes later...a little irritated....10 mins later.....may as well see if they EVER come back to the phone....15 minutes later I hung up. Took a screen shot... to show my wife. Wow....in a small community like Providence...guest service needs to be a FOCUS!! Decided to order from Jersey Mike's. We will not be visiting this establishment again.."}
{"text":"Sketchy location, but friendly service. It was World Sandwich Day. Buy one sub plus a 30 oz. drink and get one sub free. I got an Oven Roasted Chicken Breast foot-long and a Blackforest Ham foot-long. They were both accurately prepared by friendly sandwich artists. Did you know that they offer Fuze tea?

There was a big guy who came in with a QT cup and filled it with pop. No one said anything. This area has many indigents and rougher looking people. I don't blame the workers for not making a scene."}
{"text":"We were on our way to hike at Red Rock Canyon. We figured we would grab some sandwiches and have a little picnic while we were there. We were intrigued by the drive-thru option and figured we would give it a try. Big mistake! As soon as we pulled up to the menu, a girl's voice came over the loudspeaker and informed us that she would be right with us. After about 5 minutes of waiting, a guy's voice came on and said we would be helped shortly. After 5 more minutes of sitting outside waiting to order, we were done. We pulled out and left. We went down the street to a different Subway (there are like 3-4 more in the immediate area) and were in and out quickly. We will not be returning to this one."}
{"text":"I am proud of my neighborhood Subway. I checked out the other reviews, and they were primarily negative. However, we have always been treated politely and served quickly. Our Subway servers were friendly and put together our customized sandwiches. Last night, they were out of the rotisserie chicken. Granted, it was late in the evening. So, we chose the oven roasted chicken sandwich. The veggies were fresh. We like a splash of the Sweet Onion Sauce to give it a zing. We were in and out in under ten minutes. I suppose that it is not always exciting to write a review about fast food chain restaurants like Subway. However, if we regular reviewers don't write about the more mundane restaurants and what they do well, they might only receive reviews from the really bad experiences. I am grateful to have a Subway that is pretty A-OK in our corner."}
{"text":"Not entirely sure why this place is rated 2 stars. It's a standard Subway, and I'm a fan of Subway. Really the only thing working against this location is the awful, awful little and often packed parking lot of the overall shopping area. If it's a busy day in the overall complex, I have to give this Subway a pass.

Since the lot wasn't too bad a couple days ago I stopped in to grab some dinner and they quickly got my 6\" sub ready to go - in fact a different employee came out from the back to assemble my food so I wouldn't have to wait for the group in front of me to finish their order before I got mine. Seeing as the group in front of me hadn't quite decided what they wanted, I definitely appreciated this.

I was in, ordering and heading back out within about four or five minutes - got my chicken sandwich toasted, got my toppings and Chipotle sauce, paid, boom. Everything was well stocked on the toppings bar, the bread was perfectly toasted and didn't crumble, and most importantly I left with a soft raspberry cheesecake cookie. Yum!

Thanks for being my go to, Subway - it's good to have somewhere to grab a bite that's affordable, yummy, fast, and not nearly as bad for me as most fast food options!"}
{"text":"$6 foot long specials. Tuesday Special was the oven roasted chicken. I love the Italian Herb and cheese bread. The veggies are fresh and I enjoyed my meal. Service was fast and friendly. Don't forget to get it toasted."}
{"text":"The workers must be trained to give you one pickle, half a cucumber, and a sprinkle of lettuce because we had to ask for more of each topping. Don't understand why the service has to be so chincy. Do not recommend this subway franchise--such a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I rather fuck a porcupine than ever eat at this dump again...\"
\"Food was atrocious at best...\"
\"Potential of food poisoning...\""}
{"text":"As I begin this review, I cannot help but notice that neither Subway, nor its franchisee, has replied to anything written.

With that being said, this is the short review of my disgusting visit this evening. 

I walked in and there were two people working. Greg was sweeping in the dining area and another employee, without a name tag, was finishing up the order of the one person ahead of me.  No greeting by either when I walked in, rather a huff and eyeroll by Greg that I had inconvenienced his sweeping efforts.

After he washed his hands and donned his food service gloves, I asked if the sandwich I wanted was included in their special. No eye contact, \"uh huh\", is all I got.  He began making my sandwich and asked, with all the personality of a rock, if I wanted it toasted; to which I replied, \"yes please\".  He put my sandwich in the toaster and I moved down so he could help the person behind me.

No name tag finished the sale with the customer ahead of me, my sandwich was still toasting.  He closed the cash register, walked over to put on gloves, and then headed to get my sandwich out of the oven.  Before he could open the oven door I said to him, \"please don't touch my sandwich until you have washed your hands and put on new gloves, you were just handling money and didn't wash your hands\".  This clearly ruffled his feather as he raised his voice and said, \"I didn't touch any money, don't be lying up in here.\"  I replied, \"I just watched you finish the transaction of the gentleman in front of me, with dirty hands you picked up gloves and put them on.  Whether you touched money or not for the sale, you didn't wash your hands.\"  He continued getting louder and repeated, \"I didn't touch any money you liar\".  At this point Greg told him to stop.

I told no name tag that he could keep my sandwich because his hygiene was disgusting and that I would be reporting the restaurants sanitation practices.  With that, I walked out.

It is appalling in this day and age that basic handwashing before food handling isn't paramount at any establishment serving food.

I will not return to this Subway and as promised, I reported them to the county and state. 

People wonder how foodborne illness spreads so quickly. This was a perfect example.  His filthy hands touching clean gloves and then a patrons food, seems pretty straight foward.

Avoid this Subway location at all cost."}
{"text":"Went here since it was close and read the reviews, many of which are from people who hate life in general. Like Limmy who gave it a 1 star because the guy didn't smile or keelan who gave it a 1 star because the guy had a \"gay accent\"
First off the place is clean, the Indian guy who works there is laid back and super friendly, I asked for double toppings and he gave me one of the biggest subway sandwiches I've had, and finally he asked me if I wanted a bag to go for my sandwich while I was sitting down since I wasn't able to finish the monster. Tells me to have a good day as I walk out in his supposedly \"gay accent\""}
{"text":"There isn't too much to say about Subway, but I will say that it really has come out from the back of the fast food chain. It's not technically a deli anymore because of the other \"goodies\" they've chosen to add to their menu.  They have pizzas, buffalo chicken, and the newest addition to their menu are the breakfast items!

This Subway was my choice for lunch when I was working in the NE area of Las Vegas. Every time I come here it's always busy for lunch! Never failed once for me to spend half my lunch in line :'(  I don't know if it's this particular Subway and it's size or if it's all Subways, but I come out smelling like onions! Wth?! Weird.  The workers aren't very personable, but aren't rude so, my experiences here fall between a long 'Ehh' and a hand-rocking \"OK\".

I'm also wary about the breakfast items here and how healthy they are. I'm not completely sure if they're the carton eggs or real eggs. So, until I try them, I won't knock them. I wouldn't come back here because it isn't convenient for me to drive this way anymore, but I will still continue to stay between the 'Ehh' and hand-rocking \"OK\" with Subway. There are far better deli's in Las Vegas with better sandwiches for abou the same price."}
{"text":"I went to get a footlong sub for lunch/dinner. The employee was without a doubt the most rude person I have met in a while... The experience was not a good one I'll go somewhere next time."}
{"text":"The two women at the counter spoke to each other in Spanish the whole time I was in there.  The sandwich was okay.  Parking lot sucks to get out of though."}
{"text":"Expensive, rude service, i been a lot times here and always the same , inside arizina charlie casino"}
{"text":"Awesome service, and food is fresh. Best subway in the East Valley! Will come here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a meatball sub. Guy dug out all the sauce from the bottom of the container along with one meatball. I had to tell him it was the worse looking sandwich I'd ever seen. He asked if I wanted more meatballs. Yeah! More than one on a sandwich would be nice. He found another container fresh with more meatballs and place a couple on the bread. I also ordered a steak and cheese sub toasted. Got back to my office 3 minutes away and the meat ball sub bread was a mess. My steak and cheese wasn't even hot enough to melt the cheese.  Terrible. Last time there for me."}
{"text":"Newly remolded, great service every time I go, always clean and I've never had to wait...but that's during dinner times I can't review the lunch rush.

FYI Mondays are free cookie day"}
{"text":"I like Subway, but this location is always packed! Every time I come here there is always a wait. Don't bother going during lunch, because the line is out the door. I've literally had to turn around and leave because the line/wait was too long."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The service is poor.  The workers do their best to keep up with fast service. But management needs to hire more workers during busy times."}
{"text":"Got a kid's meal with turkey, milk, and chips. The guy who made my sandwich was generous with the portions. Usually at other Subways, I always have to ask them to put more in the sandwich. The lady who rang me up was patient with me because I had a free cookie coupon but our transaction was already done, she didn't have attitude and gave me the cookie. Since I have a long drive ahead, used the restroom and it was super clean! My only comment is that this Subway doesn't have a lot of seating available, it's smaller than other Subways."}
{"text":"This is my 6th time eating at this location. Either get the bmt or tuna or turkey and I have to say; WOW! Sandwich was made to perfection. Usually certain Subways lack on the sandwich making skills but not this one. This is my new Subway. Every time I have ordered it is the same lady and she knows what she is doing lol."}
{"text":"The pro's of the corporate business... Subway is a very extended franchise. As such, it utilizes the same cold cuts, bakes the same bread, and creates the same \"general\" sandwhich types at every store. This is a plus. I tend to dislike places I can never rely on getting the same meal, because it differs, it is made by different people, etc. Sure, the meats and cheeses aren't the freshest as they come from a corporate manufacturing HQ, but so what? If I'm feeling frisky, I can go to my local Jersey Mikes and pay another $4 for the same sandwhich! 

As an individual watching what I eat from time to time, its good to know that there is a business out there in the food industry that does a great job tending to my demographic. The abundance of healthy choices and vast information associated with such makes managing a diet easy, given this is your food of choice and you enjoy subs and salads.

This particular location has been a bit of dissapointment to me. I very seldom frequent here but find myself attending a lunch occasionally as it is directly by the office. Despite the varying time of my excursion around 12pm, there always seems to be a crowd and a sandwhich prepper taking their time at orders. Don't come to this location anywhere near lunchtime! Its a location that gets great business, but yet still does not serve a breakfast either.

My final thoughts? Employ an entirely new staff. There's one guy there that seems to have his act together and trys his best to get people in and out, all others seem to have no desire to be efficient and/ or quick. They could also use some help on learning how to keep things \"together\" in a sandwhich. Deli 101 guys, Deli 101."}
{"text":"Just started up. Room for improvement. Slow service and a fair amount of order mistakes. Fountain water costs $.50/cup now?? 

The interior area is nice, and has adequate seating. Typical Subway otherwise."}
{"text":"This subway is absolutely disgusting! I order a turkey sandwich toasted and as he began to put the veggies I noticed they were slimy and covered in ice clumps. I told him nvm I don't want the sandwich anymore due to the veggies and the guy laughed in my face (his name was Alex with glasse) and said it's just ice in a snotty tone. Last time I checked vegetables aren't supposed to be clingy with ice clumps. I definitely will never be back"}
{"text":"With subways on every corner thus is by far the best one. Always fresh product and great customer service. Subway is subway but it is the little things that make it 4 stars."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. The new workers that I have seen will ignore you at the window and will make you wait 10-15 before taking your order. This has happened twice in a row, and I don't know how much longer I would have been waiting because I ended up driving off before my order was even taken. It's these two guy workers in particular that make this subway horrible. As someone who cane weekly and never had a single complaint. I will never come to this subway again!"}
{"text":"Open 24/7 and the gentleman working was quick, polite and you could tell he enjoys interacting with people."}
{"text":"I walked in with my 8 week old puppy in my arms to order a sandwich to go after just leaving the vet to go home. They refused my service and said the dog couldn't be in there! No one in the place but the employees and I!!!"}
{"text":"The two young men that work here are very professional! I dumped a soda on accident and they were very nice about it and very prompt with the clean up."}
{"text":"First off, first time to Phoenix and it's been an interesting week. Phoenix do better. How about corporate pay this spot a visit for a quality check. Issue #cover your food. Everything is wilted like I'm not sure if it's the heat or it's old. Second don't be so cheap. I mean if I pay $8 for a sandwich I should get veggies and that shouldn't be an issue. You shouldn't have to be told not to put old veggies on a sandwich throw that shit out bruh. And why the hell you smashing everything with your hands, you High or something? Won't be back ever in life."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Totally incompetent \"manager\" needs lessons in customer service, math and social skills. Truly sad."}
{"text":"I like coming to this location, but today they were a bit sluggish and the veggie bar was messy as heck. It made me not want to choose my toppings. Im hoping it was just a one day thing."}
{"text":"You can't get much faster than these guys.  I have been here several times at different times of day and they are always quick & polite too."}
{"text":"Probably one of the longest wait I've every had to experience just for a subway sandwich. Subway did launch an app to order in advance then come pick up when things are ready. I don't frequent to subway when I'm in the city. But since I'm out I Vegas for work, you'd think the quickest place to get food with a sandwich spot. WRONG.

At the Mandalay Bay, there's only this one food court with 4 businesses; Johnny Rockets, Nathan, Pan Asian Express and Subway. There needs to be another food court! It was an hour of a wait for subway and all stalls had long lines. Service was alright, it's a food court. They fulfilled all requests that were asked. Just the wait if ridiculous. Maybe next time I'll try their app and see if it's any better than physically waiting on line


AVOID THE FOOD COURT IF YOU CAN DURING PEAK LUNCH HOURS!"}
{"text":"17 dollars for a footling club and a soda. Wayyy to expensive and I should know better. Could of spent 9 dollars at Panda next door for twice the amount of food"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, employees are polite. The restaurant is clean with good food. I enjoy this subway."}
{"text":"I really have no idea if,the food,would,be good or not. I stood there for 5 minutes waiting for someone to come up front. A tall white,guy with bllondish hair walks,up , ignores me and goes back to doing what he was doing. Then a short hispanics girl comes up front , looks at me and she too goes back to what she was doing. There was only one other person in the place, so they were clearly not busy. Maybe if you want a higher rating you should train your employees about customer service. Maybe you don't,care that at lunch time there is only one,person in your establishment. Smh"}
{"text":"Looks like the lady ringing you up came from collecting money off the 17 and Indian school freeway exit.  Dirty, hairy clothes and dirty hands."}
{"text":"I have managed a couple subway stores when I was younger. I was appalled by the way these employees were talking amongst themselves about personal business rather than to the customer about their food. I waited for several minutes just to pay for my food because the cashier was chit chattin with the one doing meat. This is not subway standards. Very unprofessional. My stores NEVER acted like this!! These people were not friendly, organized or clean about anything. I am sorry to say I may have to return just because is a close lunch stop. Their peanut butter cookies were way over cooked and the macadamia nut cookies were so undercooked that they were falling apart."}
{"text":"Worst subway my husband and I have ever been to. We got there with literally only one person in line and waited for 20 min. When they made my husband's sandwhich, the bread looked awful. It was ripped and small (probably more like a 4 inch sub...the guy had to put meatballs side by side bc they didnt even fit)! My husband said something about it and the guy did nothing, just continued on like he didnt want to be there. No apology for the wait or service, discounts, coupons or anything. Would give this location 0 stars if possible, will not return here."}
{"text":"It's difficult to submit this review without using profanity but I'll do my best. I realize that the elderly are working longer these days due to the economy but they must understand they did this to themselves. A friend and I visited this store and the elderly woman was so rude to my friend that I cancelled my order mid-sandwich. He started by asking her if they had the rotisserie chicken and she rudely said no. She started my order while he was still deciding, he asked her 3 times if they had more of the chicken breast and I never heard her answer and she mumbled what I thought was \"unbelievable\". I asked her what she said to him and she told him that she already answered him 3 times. That is when I cancelled. While we were walking out she told my friend he should clean his ears out. Wow! Terrible customer service. The draw to an already inferior sandwich shop is low, this drags them down even further."}
{"text":"I have long said that there are only 2 kinds of Subway location... one that works and one that doesn't. This is an example of one that works."}
{"text":"Lady had the worst attitude and made a Fucked up ass sandwich 1030am Tuesday 5/3/16  rediculouse"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Subways I've been to. The store is very clean and the staff is always friendly. I'm a creature of habit and almost always get the Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki but I certainly cannot complain. It's good, it's cheap, and fast which is perfect for a quick dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Folks, please take me seriously when I say, DO NOT come here during their lunch rush unless you are ordering inside. They will mess your order up ordering from drive thru just to get through the rush faster. It makes sense, since they don't expect people to check their food after pick up. I don't even want to go into detail, all I'm going to say is I returned 5 minutes later, for them to redo my Turkey sandwich, as they forget the most basic ingredients+what I added on extra, and after they had edited their mess up, they still messed up. I'm not raging (anymore), but the whole ordeal was extremely inconvenient. Blah.."}
{"text":"I must say that for awhile now I have stayed clear of Subways because of the smell inside the restaurants making you smell just like it when you leave but ....

I am completely impressed at how clean and non smelly this store was compared to the ones I've visited at in Alaska. The employees are freindlier and they didn't pile my pickles in one spot or squirt a huge blob of mayo in a particular spot! 

I'm not quite sure the names of the 2 guys working tonight but THANKS! I am now a fan of Subway again :-D"}
{"text":"Every time I wanted something different I got an attitude.  I wanted a six inch for my son who needed the veggies cut up.  I then went to check out and apparently the six inch is not part of the kids meal.  You do not have a message saying that.  I said I want the kids meal.  The short guy with the mustache said of course and gave me more attitude.  Instead of being out, one six inch sub, you are now out a foot and 1/2 of chicken sandwiches.  I left without food.  I went home and cooked.  Sure we are eating later but I won't pay for bad service."}
{"text":"I don't know how service could get any worse. Not only is the restaurant really dirty, the lady at the cash seemed like she was fed up with her job. Not only was I mostly ignored during the entire process of building my sandwich, after I paid, she practically threw my sandwich at me. No \"thank you\", no \"have a good day\". She immediately turned around to her coworker, and began taking with him in a foreign language, completely ignoring everyone else. Do these people not understand what customer service entails, or do subways in Toronto not care about who they hire, as long as they can speak English? If so, then why are there much friendlier homeless, jobless people on the street, instead of behind the cash register?"}
{"text":"Now, food-wise, this Subway is pretty standard. 
Cheap, quick, decently passable food. Normally, I would give this place a 3 star, because I'm not the hugest fan of the food or the fact that if you eat here you'll smell like the ingredients for the rest of the day.... but I'm giving it one whole extra star because of the STAR quality of service I had on Tuesday morning.

I was helped by a nice lady who quickly made me a Tuesday special (chicken breast sub). She was excellent, extremely sweet, and just good at her job. I thoroughly was impressed, therefore I recommend this place to those in the area! :)"}
{"text":"I just ordered online from this location and it said to be there at 12:50 so I was there at that time but my order was not ready. The staff member making the sandwiches also was the assistant manager and he said that he only knew part of the order because the receipt tape ran out of the printer and he didn't get the details of the rest of the sandwich order. Had I not known what my coworker had ordered I would have had to drive back to work ask her what was on her sandwich and then drive back to Subway because I had already paid for these two sandwiches which subway had taken my money out of my account but didn't make the sandwiches because of a printing issue at the franchise restaurant. Luckily I have an excellent memory and I remembered exactly how she wanted her tuna wrap. I asked the asst manager if I couldn't remember would he have funded my money for the one sandwich and he said corporate would have to refund me because I ordered online. It's ridiculous that a problem created at the franchise level is rectified Days Later by corporate. We finally got our wraps thanks to me not Subway and I will not be ordering via online or maybe ever from this location because my time is important but Subway doesn't think so."}
{"text":"This is a 5 star for Subway, but compared to other sandwiches and sandwich restaurants,  it's a 3 star.

Their sandwiches arent as tasty or fresh as Port of Subs or Capriotti's.  

Fast service.  Ample seating."}
{"text":"Second time coming here( came for lunch around 12:30 8/25/2017) and still disappointed. The kids u got making sandwiches are not even approach able. Not even friendly. Stood there for 3 mins with a girl who was stocking stuff right in front of me didn't even acknowledge I was standing there..then comes a guy
Who looks super unfriendly and also rolled his eyes when he had to get me soup, gave me no spoon..also with my kids meal for my son I got no toy, no drink or any side. I think I've gotten a kids meal once before and it came in a bag with all that stuff. This guy just wrapped my kids sandwhich and I was given just that. Won't be coming back to your location"}
{"text":"My husband and kids come to the subway a lot. We usually have amazing customer service and we usually have no issues with making our sandwiches. But for some reason everytime 'Lauren' is working we have issues with our making of our sandwiches.. she's very rude and does it have any customer service skills. The last I knew Subway is known for making it your way!!!  it seems every time I've come in here and she has been here she wants to make it ' her' way and only her way... Next time we come and she here we will not order and will go some othet place."}
{"text":"I left my glossy 8x10 photo signed at the front desk for Stacy they said she wasn't working I'm just following up to make sure she received it and also let her know that I autographed that myself that wasn't my assistant Sergio's writing. 

I know he dropped it off but it was my signature. anyways does she ask about me? I'll stop in for my usual Italian dressing on wheat cold just lemme know then thanks.

The turkey breast looks a lot like elephant skin. Just saying."}
{"text":"Well  yet another Subway but this one is tucked away in side the Cleve. Clinic. The food also seems to be slightly different then a street location. Could be food policies of CCF. The staff could be a ting more pleasant in the CS dept."}
{"text":"Just no longer a fan the food quality from the 90's till today is so so different. Sad it will never be what it once was. Think im done trying other locations"}
{"text":"Stay away. They overcharge customers on combos. Menu board says one price and register rings something else. When i pointed this out the worker told me i was wrong. The store manager even told me i was wrong. After she pulled out her calculator and admitted i was right she blamed it on the register and said she was unable to reprogram it. She said it was set by the company. Total baloney. Totally scamming customers."}
{"text":"I have been to this subway at 16th st and thomas many times. What I like about subway in general is they fix the food rite there in front of you (I guess most sub shops do now that I think about it) so the chance of them botching your order is low.

As far as THIS location, yes, it's not located in the best part of town. I was once confronted in the parking lot by some guy riding a bike saying he could fix my car, he started touching the undercarriage and trying to say a body part needed replacement. I take great care of my car so I knew that was a scam. The food of course is great, I love their cookies, always big and fresh. As far as the employees, they are pretty friendly but being it's a sandwich shop, yes you cant count on seeing the same people there too long. My biggest gripe about this location is I have been there more than once when they are supposed to be open in the morning and they arent. Their hours posted on their door even say they should have been open. If someone calls in sick, doesnt subway have some kind of backup plan? The first time it happened I just blew it off. But it happened today and I complained on subway.com. It can be especially frustrating if you find it closed when it should be open on the last day your coupon is good for. They oughta give you a raincheck or something."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a quick bite and while ordering a sandwich my boss calls. I asked the young lady to hold for just a second and noticed it realty pissed her off. I quickly answered his question and went back to ordering. After getting the silent treatment and having my change tossed at me I started to walk out. As I was leaving and noticed I was the only customer,I turned and told her she didn't have to be so nasty. Her reply \"you shouldn't be taking phone calls when I'm making your order\"....really???"}
{"text":"Food is fine but they stopped giving water cups. I was forced to buy a bottle of water for $1.95. It is absurd, in my opinion, to refuse free water to patrons who are dining in."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes you know what you're getting but I've been going to this subway since it opened and the same lady still doesn't know English and doesn't understand special orders"}
{"text":"Don't ever go to this subway , the people that work there they're very rude and no personality at all, from the moment we walked in the 2 employees that were there just looked at us, no hi no greetings, then when making our subs couldn't really hear them and when you can't hear them they get mad and started with the attitude."}
{"text":"Very friendly place. 
Fantastic subway food as always. 
The whole world awaits a subway drive through though so that we can all eat healthier!!!!! 
Maybe one day in our dreams"}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch around 12:40. There were 3 workers, 2 girls & a very creepy RUDE man who apparently was the owner. I had a chicken bacon ranch, with only spinach & black olives only! I asked him for more black olives 5 times!! 2 times he gave me 2 more olives & the other times he literally ignored me. I feel extremely bad for the workers who work under him. Will NEVER be going here again. Your store would run better if you were nicer to people."}
{"text":"It's a Subway.

But 3 young ladies working at lunch on 02/16 were very polite and attentive (even as I fumbled with my phone not realizing they were ready for my order).  The teen at the cash register even paid for a stranger's lunch when her card was declined.

I'm almost ashamed I was so surprised with the great customer service but this shop is very lucky to have these employees, each with a great future ahead of each of them."}
{"text":"I'm going to mention that this particular location just isn't up to par. Stopped in today around 4:30pm and I have to say it was the filthiest I've ever seen it. The floors were covered with crumbs & misc dirt and the area where they make our sandwiches had misc food particles left all over it, there were vegetables scattered into other vegetable bins and had the worst presentation I have seen yet. My other issue on different occasions is with the employees that smoke & they stand by the door so that when I walk in I have to walk through the smoke. I did say something about that one evening but who knows if it mattered. I'm not going to stop by this location any longer, from now on I'll drive to the one on 51st ave, it's always clean."}
{"text":"You get the usual subway service here. Nothing to write home about, although it can get unreasonably busy during lunch time. The Quiznoes down the street is a much quieter alternative and I find it to have better quality food."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my daughter on our way to a concert at Blossom. Service was quick and polite.

Our sandwiches we made correctly and tasted just as they should. 

No issues here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while on ASU's Tempe Campus. I love subway, but very disappointed with the service and quality of sandwich making. She was more concerned on telling the cashier that I got double cheese than putting an adequate number of vegetables on my sandwich. For a small, quaint little place, they should focus on perfecting their customer service and sandwich making.. Considering that's pretty much their job."}
{"text":"This is the most pathetic salad I have ever gotten from Subway. First they didn't have spinach, and the amount of veggies put on the salad is ridiculous. A Subway 6 inch usually has 2 things of meat. I only received one. One thing is certain. I will never stop here again on the way to or from Vegas."}
{"text":"My aunt and I had lunch here on the weekend. Service was ok but I had a hard time understanding the one guy behind the counter. My sub was made the way I like. Both my aunt and I enjoyed our lunch. I always love Subway and this location did just fine."}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing experience here. The food was prepared with such passion and the customer service was phenomenal. I highly recommend this location to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"It beats the one that's in the Cote-Vertu Mall

This used to be a Quiznos that failed, 
it's a bit quiet, but lots of workers show up at rush hour.
When you're tight on time for work, it's hit and miss.

The location is pretty big compared to other Subways, lots of room to sit and read.

The food is the same as anywhere else, but they do fix any issues you have 
(gave me a bottle when the soft drink machine was out)."}
{"text":"I think the attitude of the employees here are terrible.  Ate here yesterday.  Although the sandwich wasn't bad, everything else was.  Can't use the bathroom without \"permission\".  I can't stand locked bathrooms.  When you have to go, you have to go. The cookies were burnt.   Sadly the manager was walking around without a care in the world.  How can you Niall around like everything is good when you serve burned food and your employees have crappy attitudes.   I work close to this subway and that's why I went there yesterday.  I am trying to be a little more healthy...   Hopefully I don't have to come back to this location.  Also the manager helped herself to a soda cup from the customer side of the counter.  I didn't see her pay for it.  Makes me wonder if enter all theft like that is what makes prices go up."}
{"text":"I love this Subway. They're always open and the sandwich artists make the perfect sandwich. Spicy Italian is the best. Thanks"}
{"text":"Ordered 6 foot sandwich.  They were ready for usv. Half was turkey and half mixed meats . The bread was fresh . The lunch meat on the sandwich was sufficien t.  Average was 4.00 per person"}
{"text":"great steak sub"}
{"text":"Was Here Memorial Day Weekend. What a Mess. Staff needs to go. If you don't want to work at subway, then don't work at subway. Everything was done with an attitude. Everything being thrown around or harshly. Worst subway I have ever been to."}
{"text":"It's like business hours are just a suggestion!!  Their door sign says they close at 930p (even though Subway.com says they close at 10p), yet we arrived at 845p on a Monday night and they were already closed!!  The ladies were still inside cleaning up and totally ignored us when we tried to wave them down.  Totally ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Consistently the worst subway sandwich. I don't know where they get there training from because it is nothing like any other subway I have ever been to. They just straight suck at making sandwiches, can't cut the bread worth shit, just toss everything in so it all falls out when you try to eat it. I hate going there but it is close so i do once in a while but it is always a shity sandwich. Go to the one on ASU campus downstairs in the MU, they have there shit together."}
{"text":"After a long day at a food show in Erie, PA.  We stopped by this Subway to grab a quick bite.  Of course we needed to make a quick stop in the bathroom however, after checking the locked door twice we had to ask to see if anyone was using the restroom. The girl working said \"it's not working, someone put a bunch of napkins in the toilet\".  When we asked the girls of there was any bathroom nearby they didn't answer us.  It was almost a joke to them.  We had to run to the Panera located in the strip mall next to theirs and use their restroom, all of this after we started our order we should have just walked out at that time. Shouldn't a note have been posted on the door in regards to the restroom being \"out of order\"? In general, we didn't get the warm and fuzzy's from this Subway."}
{"text":"Subway is subway but this one is too busy that I'd not frequent it a lot.  And not sure what the deal was but my chicken sub was bland and tasted even more poor than typical subway does.  I will most likely not be coming back here again when I can go to Dave's Cosmic Subs in town which is much better."}
{"text":"1 star given bc I stopped by post workout for a sandwich Monday night and the doors were locked though it was only 730pm and they were supposed to be open until 9pm. Woman behind counter saw me try to enter but completely ignored me and my attempts to ask what was going on. Normally this is a good store but the lack of professional courtesy on this occasion was rude especially since she was \"breaking\" hours of operation"}
{"text":"I bought a roast beef sub friday night.  The amount of roast beef they put on was cheap. I felt ripped off and still hungry like everytime I eat Subway."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  The first time, I wasn't thrilled as the sandwich that was prepared was so skimpy (tuna) and I had to practically beg the sandwich maker to put more tuna.  The second visit, well suffice it to say just as skimpy.  The sandwich maker wasn't thrilled to be working and as there again wasn't enough tuna to even notice, I had to go big on the lettuce, etc.  So basically I paid for a big lettuce and bread sandwich.  The sandwiches are much better at Jersey Mike's and I have given up on Subway"}
{"text":"This Subway is awful!  Customer service is so-so.  Not very friendly or accommodating.  Ordered a bunch of footlong subs for a party and wanted the sides on the side.  Was told they had no plastic containers or even a baggie to put them in.  I actually had to go to the Safeway, buy some plastic baggies and hand them to the sandwich maker.  How sad!  Also, the amount of meats and tuna that were put on them was slim at best.  I didn't expect tons of meat or tuna, but at least a little substance, so you don't just eat bread and lettuce.  Honestly, I'll be taking my business to Jersey Mike's.  At least their sandwiches are hearty for the same price."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE

On a Sunday night after returning from a weekend trip, my daughter wanted to stop at Subway before I dropped her at her apartment. Here is her story.

\"When we got back to Phoenix, I asked my mom to stop at Subway near my apartment. When I walked in the door, they were in the midst of some audio comedy skit. The words I heard were, \"Couldn't you just f__ that?\" It continued, extremely vulgar, and listening to it I thought it might be David Cross but it was still weird to hear in a Subway.\"

Meanwhile as I waited in the car, I watched as several men walked out of the Subway and into the neighboring water/ice cream store. At least one of them had a gun strapped on his belt. 

While these boys are not doing anything illegal in Arizona, seeing youngsters with guns strapped on their belts is unnerving. After hearing my daughter's account of what happened inside the store it is one place I will never go again. 

To be fair, I also called the store the next morning to talk to the owner before posting on this website. The person who answered the phone said he did not have contact information for the owner. When I questioned him, he he told me to call back in five minutes. I asked why and was silent. I could only hear laughter and other noises in the background. The line went dead. 

STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"I bought a sandwich. Went to use the restroom, there was no working light in the restroom. I went and told a male employee and he responded that he knew about it, and it had not been working for a few days. I found that very disturbing that people might be discouraged to clean their hands because they could not see."}
{"text":"This was my second (and final) visit to this subway. 
The first time I went to this location I ordered a veggie delight to go and the bread was so stale (when I got back to work) I had to throw my sandwich away without being able to eat it. Major sad face! 
Today I decided to give them a second shot and the kid that was making my sandwich was so busy turning around and talking to the other teen employee, he had to ask me everything 2-3 times since he wasn't paying attention to me. After watching him ruin my sandwich, I decided I was not paying for that nor was it edible and said so to the older lady (was she a manager?). She stood there just quiet, not a word, but the teen girl ( the object of affection of my sandwich maker kid) and she rudely said to me they would have to remake my sandwich ... ummm yeah that's what I want...to pay for an edible sandwich that isn't all wrong and also with the top half of the bread fallen off completely . She was so rude with me (yet I was being completely professional) about it and I decided I'd have enough of this awful service , I told them that they wouldn't have to go through the burden of making me a new sandwich since their customer service was very poorly lacking and I left."}
{"text":"So I love subway cookies and sometimes the service isn't the best which is okay... I think this would be a very trying job for the amount of pay... admit it we are all very picky about how we like our sandwiches (ex. 
\"Hi what can get you today?\"
Customer: \"6in Ham and cheese on wheat but wait only a little cheese and only if it's fat free, ummm ummm ummm mayo??  Ummmm ummm yeah a little mayo ummm yeah a little\"
Employee: \"sure no problem! What veggies would you like today?\" With a smile 
Customer: \"are they organic? If they are organic are they local? Can I see the package you receive them in?\"
Line of 5 forming behind....
Employee: \" I'll go check on all that for you...\"
Customer: rolls eyes \" I don't have much time so just leave the veggies off I'm sure they aren't.\"
This would be a hard thing to deal with once let alone all day... tonight Isaiah working here was very kind and seemed to still have the care for people most loose when working in the food service industry... he is the 5 stars and so is the care of offering the options subway does cuz I know my orders are difficult but I'm never told no."}
{"text":"Had foot long ham on wheat.  Sub tasted really fresh and was really good
  Service was prompt and courteous.  Nice experience."}
{"text":"Says they're open until 12am, went in at 11:04pm and wouldn't serve us. Little ridiculous. Past 4 times have tried to order a panini and machine is still \"not working\" or wasn't \"set up\". Don't go, not worth it."}
{"text":"This is now the closest subway to my residence.  Therefore I feel it behooves me to get to know my local subway and its employees as soon as possible, as I am nothing without subway once a week!

With that being said, its a SUBWAY folks!  

I will say that the one time I went here the cust. service wasn't on the spectacular side.  But that's OK.  Why?  Because my chicken bacon ranch sub WAS on the spectacular side!  They didn't short me on the cheese, veggies, or sauces.  

I also like that there is parking here, in an otherwise crowded area where parking is ALWAYS scarce.  

This is the subway for you, if you are in the Plaza Midwood area."}
{"text":"A sign on the wall says this Subway served subs to the United States Secret Service during a Bush visit to Phoenix. Wow! Unfortunately, the fact that it served subs to the people who take bullets for the president still does not make its subs anything special.

Of course, if you like lettuce, by all means, come here fast. If it's the end of the world and I'm craving a sandwich, I'll throw a brick through the window of a Subway--this location or any other subway. God knows they probably have, without fear of hyperbole, a million bags of vacuum-packed shredded lettuce under their counters.

Anyway, did I say that someone whose job it is to take a bullet for the president has eaten a sandwich from this Subway?"}
{"text":"This subway might be quick, but they are always out of something. You sell subs, soups , cookies and chips. How can you always be out of cookies. The bad part is they don't care when mention it to them. Your losing sales in which give you a paycheck. Get a clue!!!"}
{"text":"Please avoid this location at all costs.  The workers here do not pay attention to you EVEN WHEN THEY ARE MAKING YOUR SANDWICH.

It wasn't just me, either - I actually stayed and watched several customers come and go and almost all of them had their orders wrong.  They were telling the lady exactly what they wanted in the order of the sandwich bar and it was STILL screwed up.  This is one customer at a time, too.

If you speak Spanish, maybe you'll get better, more attentive service.  When I was there, one lady came in and spoke with them for 10-15 minutes while making her sandwich as other customers began to line up.

Just keep going.  It's not worth it.  I promise."}
{"text":"Went to subway around 12:10 am went thou the drive thru cause u didn't have my coat to get out and when I got home I realized they made my sandwich on white bread when I asked for herbs and chess bread smh  lost my appetite"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst! I've gone here maybe 4 times now and they skimp on absolutely everything. And to top it all off I found hair inside!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location today around 11pm. Yes its late but sign said it was open. My Husband went in and was acknowledged by a guy at the register who said the generic \"welcome to subway\". My husband stood there for 5 min and the guys kept doing his thing at the register. So my husband asked if he knew how much longer it would be and the guy responded about 10 or 15min. My husband being as nice as he is asked why he didnt i form him it would be a while. And the guy just said unapologetically \"Im sorry man I thought you saw what I was doing\" My husband just walked out since they obviously dont care to inform their customers of delays or even acknowledge them accordingly. I have a pet peeve about bad customer service...If you dont like your job Leave!!! There are plenty of people that need jobs who actually care about doing a good job at whatever job they do. Dont waste your time go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Run by Nazis, paper thin meats, and an over all lack of care invested into ever sandwich(?) they make.

Typically slower than other establishments, esspecially during busier times.

Expect to wait upwards of 15 minutes during a lunch rush."}
{"text":"Love this subway! They are always so friendly and fast. I have never had an issue when going here for a quick bite to eat unlike some other places."}
{"text":"My family and I were hungry and this Subway is open 24 hours but the guy that was working said he had to close the register and it would take over 30 minutes. We waited and 45 minutes passed and the guy was nowhere to be found. Turns out he was sitting at the tables in the food court, on his phone. If you have to close the register from the night before and it's 3:15am, why didn't you do that at 12:00am? Like, did this guy decide to take a break while he was \"restarting\" the register.

Kinda disappointed but we won't let that ruin our weekend in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Another place that's walking distance. Subway is one of those places where you can't go wrong....you got 5-dollar value meals or foot longs. The guys are really friendly and aren't stingy with the toppings. I'm not a big fan of the smell subway's have though. Eh anyways its just one of those places where im lazy and don't want to make a sandwich...plus it helps me keep my girlish figure like jared :)"}
{"text":"It's a Subway, can't go terribly wrong.

What makes this location exceptional? It may sound simple, may sound like \"no big deal\", but, to me, it made a difference. 

As the lady finished up my 2 footlong sandwiches, she realized these 2 sandwiches were for 4 individual people, she wrapped each 6 inch separately, -AND- wrote \"Dad\" on one, and made the other 3 easily identifiable, too. Very cool. Without being instructed or asked. This lady \"gets it\" :) 5 Star Service right there!!"}
{"text":"Great service and a nice looking location. It's small, but so are half the businesses in Lakewood. Even if there's guys there with thick accents, you can't help but appreciate they're work. I mean, making those subs is kinda an art. Lines are never an issue, so go get that delicious sub before it's too late"}
{"text":"Always a clean restaurant. Fast service. That's what subway is suppose to be. Quick! It amazes me how much responsibility is thrown on the employees, and especially when having to work all by themselves a lot of times."}
{"text":"Whoever the manager was on 9/6/14 at 2:00pm SUCKS. He called his one employee out of the bathroom in front of customers to serve 6 people by herself. She worked hard and got the food out fast--awesome customer service on her part considering the circumstances. But WOW. He didn't come out to help her until the 8th customer walked in. I have little respect for managers who boss their subordinates around when in actuality their help is needed as well."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Subway and usually I have no problems with it, until last night. I went in and ordered my sub as usual, and told the girl behind the counter I wanted to make my sub into a combo.  She told me AFTER I paid that a drink was not included in a combo.  Wait, what? I was pretty upset that she wouldn't let me have a drink. She told me that I could pay for a drink, because it's not included in the combo.  I said no, and I even asked if they just recently changed the combo to only being a sub and chips.Her response was pretty rude about it.  \"No, it's always been like that.\" I beg to differ, I've been going to Subway for many years and they didn't just take the drink out of the COMBO! Anyway, I decided to not waste my energy over it, and maybe I didn't need that soda, but I was still upset.  I thought later, that maybe she rang me up a la carte, but realized I asked specifically for a combo, and we later spoke about what was included in the combo, so she had to have known that's what I wanted.  Maybe next time I'll go to the subway by Walmart."}
{"text":"They do a nice job, and make a great sandwich.  Very friendly. They do charge for extra bacon."}
{"text":"If you have to use the bathroom, they have to walk you to it.  I guess too many stragglers since they are in a very public area (across from the college)

They make a good sandwich, and the service is fast."}
{"text":"The guys there were pretty nice and showed me how to even make a pizza sub.  They made the sub pretty fast, just didn't seem to have all the items readily available.

They are stuck in a corner of a small lot, but it's worth the visit"}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever written a review about subway before but unfortunately this has to be my first.

My husband went in and ordered me my usually sandwich.  Turkey, lettuce, pickles, Mayo, salt, pepper.

But unfortunately when he brought it home there was no way I could eat it. It was loaded with salt and pepper . All I kept thinking about was the sodium packed bites. In case I was just thinking too much into it , I had my husband try it , and he couldn't believe it... 

Too many shakes with that salt and pepper shaker!"}
{"text":"I'm usually a huge fan of the customer service and this was no different. There was a lady wearing a headset that was really nice and friendly who started my order, not the one that actually made my sandwich. The one taking my order was younger I believe and when I was adding items like pickles and olives to my sandwich it was as if I was asking for lite of everything. I had to ask for more to get a \"normal amount\" and even then it wasn't like she seemed unhappy about it. I really hope she was just a new artist and will get better. Can't say I will return to see if it happens."}
{"text":"One of the few places in the Providence area (as far as I know) to grab a quick bite, it was with great relief I stepped inside, for I was really hungry after biking 25 miles.  If I wanted to complete the rest of my ride, I needed food stat!  The place was clean, my sub was good, and my cookies were inhaled in 10 seconds.  A friendly suggestion to the managers of this franchise location: you may want to hire another sandwich artist!  My visit today was during the lunch hour and there were 6 or 7 people ahead of me in the queue.  The two staff members were not the fastest, nor the friendliest, and all told, it took almost half an hour from placing my order to receiving my food.  I think that's a little slow, but perhaps I was biased and just plain hungry!"}
{"text":"Great customer service along with tasty food. With the cost of food going up since minimum wage increased, it's nice to see you can still get a 6$ sub that will make you full"}
{"text":"No, no, and no. Slow service at this location. To be fair, they have a \"Now Hiring\" sign posted, but those that did work there appeared to be on their first day. It wasn't the lunch rush and there were 3 staffers, I can't understand how it took so long to get a sandwich with only 2 people ahead of me.

Subway is a chain, so the end product is going to taste fine no matter who makes it. But the guy sprays mayo all over it and asks \"more?\" ...no (it's going to be dripping out of it as is, and it did).

Subway? Yes. This location? Me thinks not."}
{"text":"Workers have no issues dealing with the lunchtime rush, handling everything calmly and courteously. Feels a bit cramped inside though."}
{"text":"I will never go back  Bad experience  I had a coupon to buy a six inch sub and any size drink for $4 but they didn't accept it. They also didn't have Wi-Fi like most subways. Sorry Subway but i'm never coming back to this location. :(  To bad I put one star for it."}
{"text":"I went  in about 11:30am, and there were only about 4 other customers  in. It seemed like there were alot more bugs/flies than the people. When I ordered,  they forgot to add napkins in my bag. They also left the countertops, open so the food was almost always exposed."}
{"text":"This used to be a good location but it changed hands in late-2013. Since then, it has gone downhill. The staff is poorly trained, most sandwiches end up looking like they've been run over by a bus, the overall experience is poor. I considered that it was only growing pains but after a few months and several visits, it's still the same lousy experience. I was a regular customer for several years but I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"I have two issues to address. My mother ordered a turkey sub. She couldn't eat it because her teeth started hurting as she ate. So she asked if she could switch her sandwich for a meatball sub, since those are softer, and pay the difference. They told her no. So she had to buy another sub.  The only reason why we stopped there for her to eat is because she is diabetic. The sandwich was so that her sugar level wouldn't get low. Then the worker asked her if she would step aside so the person behind her could order something first. She is diabetic!  Why couldn't she switch her sandwich? Subway makes enough money. Where is the customer satisfaction?"}
{"text":"My go to place for sandwiches. Staff is friendly and good attitude. They never run out of stock for my favourite items.Recommmended."}
{"text":"Watch out for those cashiers, they will input higher price item rather than what you ordered. They don't provide you with receipt in the first hand, until you asked them. 

Very bad customer service ever!"}
{"text":"Minus stars if possible. I ordered 6\" veggie delite, no cheese. They're on special this month. I've been to Mesa, Scottsdale, Phoenix and all of them have them for $2 this month. That's what I normally eat anyhow. 
I got charged full price,  the guy behind me had a footlong loaded with meat & cheese and his was less than mine. I questioned the owner he said \"we don't have to follow the other Subways,  we have a meat sub special.\" I then remembered I was in the same place months ago and ordered the daily special for Friday,  he charged full price then too! He had same response then as well. 
Save your money,  they are rude,  they don't represent Subway in a good light. According to him they don't have to."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! Went in twice this week to try and get a meatball sub every time they are out of meatballs. Even tried calling no one ever picked up the phone but we we got there the place was empty dirty and the one guy there was standing around picking his nose. I will never go there again I would rather drive across town then go back. Disgusting"}
{"text":"Just stopped in after along absence.  This location has greatly improved.  Used to have poor service and quality.  Now the sandwiches are great and the staff is very friendly.  They said management has changed and everything turned around.   People should give them a try.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Always welcomed and service is always great. Never too busy and when it is lunch time staff does a good job of moving people along."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from a fast food restaurant. But when I walk in and the employees are too busy placing their order with a friend for the restaurant next door he even acknowledge that I walked in the door is kind of ridiculous. Then to top it off when I finally do get recognized I feel like they're being put out for having to help me. Thanks for the help Nieva, I sure do appreciate it. ( I say with heavy sarcasm.) To top it off as soon as she was done checking me out she pulled out her cell phone to check her messages. Needless to say I won't be returning to the subway. I had to add I was the only customer in the place."}
{"text":"When I want a subway sandwich, I try my best to go here.  The people are respectful, kind, and make the sub fast. 

They usually have everything.  Just overall, they do a great job and I enjoy coming here, bringing my kids, eating in, or out."}
{"text":"Food is good.

Service could be vastly improved.  They have no bathroom for the customers to use (which I think is against the law for a restaurant).  I complained to Subway corporate, but never heard back from them.

Actually they do have a bathroom.  The conversation went like this:
Me: Can I use the bathroom?
Afr Am Sandwich Artist: Yes, it's thru that door
Anglo Sandwich Artist: NO, you can't.  We had a customer steal a purse from there, so no one is allowed to use it anymore
Me: take the purses out, besides I'm not going to steal anything
Anglo SA: NO, we don't allow customers to use it anymore

anyway, the sandwich was good"}
{"text":"All the staff are awesome.  Very friendly and manager is super fast!
Only downside are the neighbors.  They loiter, stare, cars in and out for several questionable businesses."}
{"text":"Best Subway on this side of town.  Everyone speaks English too which helps.  The only annoying thing is it seems like they are always training someone on the cash register which slows things down a lot when there's only two employees working. They make my sandwich quicker than they check me out sometimes so for that they lose one star."}
{"text":"I ordered the 6 inch Roast Beef with double meat and it was very good and the service was very good as well. No drinks or chips."}
{"text":"Went in in not the greatest mood but leaving all smiles luke greeted with a smile helpful opened door talking to everyone who entered keeping place clean and very nice helpful and happy he made my day better"}
{"text":"I checked the operating hours for this location online and it said 10pm. My wife and I head over for a late dinner and arrive at 9:30pm and when we go in the employee tells me they are closed. They need to update their hours of operation. Just sayin you post a closing time you should be open until that last minute."}
{"text":"Very clean, very organized, service was great, store is one of the cutest I've seen inside, no complaints!"}
{"text":"I came in to get food and was treated rudely. I asked if they had flatizzas and was told 'they dont do those anymore'. Yet the flat bread is within arm's length. I am unsure how difficult it would be to place the ingredients on said flat bread opposed to acting as though my ten minute line wait was an innconveinance to her..at her place of employment...while she is on the clock. Never returning here again."}
{"text":"Yuck. The bread was dry and stale. And they don't put enough stuff on your sub. If you want more it costs extra. Next time I'll just go to JJ's"}
{"text":"I purchased 2 veggie delite salads. #1- they had no salad bowls to use, so they had to use the SALAD LIDS!!! #2- little to my knowledge did I know or see the employee putting ROTTEN/SPOILED VEGGIES in my salad. I got it home & did not look at it carefully till I started eating it then saw that most of the veggies were spoiled. The employee told me that the power was out for 5 1/2 HOURS. The manager said they put it on ice & still he did not offer to give me money back or anything. I would not go back there if my life depended on it. NOT A GOOD RESTAURANT TO GO TO IF YOU LIKE HAVING A HEALTHY STOMACH & NOT GETTING FOOD POISONING. I can't understand for the life of me why the manager would allow this to happen. Doesn't he check the food before it goes out in the dishes they take the food from or what? I hate this store & all the other SUBWAYS. I will go & get my subs elsewhere as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"The staff here is a little wacky and off the wall, but they made good recommendations when I wasn't sure what kind of sauce to get with my sandwich. Also, for some reason it was cheaper for me to get the meal rather than just the breakfast sandwich, so they saved me some money by telling me about that."}
{"text":"Subway restaurants are always smaller then say McDonald's or the rest of their competition for that matter because... actually ,I have no know why. 

Do they think their customers are so healthy conscious they will only drop by to pick a quick sub mid-marathon and thus making tables and chairs in the locales superfluous?

This place is however 'tiny' even by Subway restaurant standards. Whenever I went into most Subway sandwich locations I feel as if I am channeling Jonah as I tried to find my way through the nooks and spaces you would think you will find stomach-deep inside a whale.

You go into this place and you feel as if you have been swallowed by a perch. 

The staff seems to realize this and are generally equally unhappy or pretty silent. Also I do not think they have the foot traffic outside perhaps lunch hours to keep their bread fresh enough.

As such, in my experience their sandwiches come out more as carb and protein filler than an actual sandwich made by a Sandwich Artist (An artist? Really? Wtf?).  

More often than not, I have seen the single employee bored and having a cigarette outside. 

However having said that, aside going to the hot dog vendor across the street, there is no other fast food joint in 2-3 blocks in any direction. So if you are in this hood and need a quick snack, well, either you starve or you get swallowed by a perch."}
{"text":"I agree with Danielle, a Subway is a Subway is a place that tried to sell itself as a healthy alternative with no caveats, is a Subway. 

Subway is not the healthiest option but it is among the healthiest if you remove 2/3 of the fun out of the sandwich, just like any other sandwich.

I have been here a few times over the years but only because I knew a few people who lived in the area as I would never come here as this particular stretch of Bloor East is particularly bland and carries a mild whiff of depressing. I think it is just all the sad-looking gray concrete and the odd homeless man seating at the bench in front of the McDonald's.  

How this location remains in business is a bit of a mystery to me as there is not much pedestrian traffic around this area. 

Anyway, if you are hungry as heck and you are in this neighbourhood and just want to pick a semi-healthy sandwich then you are out of luck, this Subway is your best pick."}
{"text":"Once in a while everyone loves subway and their sandwiches. This location is wonderful with their friendly staff and the tuna sandwich was excellent."}
{"text":"Came here last night about 9pm and ordered 4 sandwiches and the young lady behind the counter rolled her eyes. They had 1 hour till close. Good sandwiches but get attitude sucked. I do not know if I will go back"}
{"text":"If I had to choose between eating at an actual deli that I knew for certain would give me food poisoning, or a perfectly fine subway sub... I just might go with food poisoning."}
{"text":"Food is OK but one person working the entire restaurant is not OK mid-day during the week.  People need to get in an out during their lunch hour. It just isn't possible like this. Luckily there is a subway on just about every corner so I won't be back."}
{"text":"Staff is nice and friendly. I haven't had subway in over 2 years because the quality just doesn't compare to its sandwich shop competitors. I stopped in recently and was under impressed yet again. I won't be back to any subway. Please carry FRESH INGREDIENTS it does taste different."}
{"text":"No bathroom! I can only imagine how many people get sick from eating with dirty hands. 

If you drink coffee or tea you have to ask the sandwich makers for sweeteners because they don't have them in the drinks are. 

At least they have spinach and not only lettuce. I've been to so many that only have lettuce."}
{"text":"We were all sooo hungry and found this subway close to the house and rushed over there knowing that google said CLOSING SOON ( it was 11:45pm ) we get there and it was closed! So disappointing! And still hungry! Had to drive to the 24hr location on Maryland pkwy...other than that their service and sandwiches are to my liking! Only subway that doesn't ask me ( toasted?!!! ) after I have already ordered ( TUNA MELT ) YES OF COUSE! ITS A TUNA MELT!!! Just ranting cause they closed early! But I will be back this week I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Seriously, they are out of everything! No veggie patty, no cookies, I'm surprised they weren't out of oxygen! Another thing they were running low on was brain cells. It took both of the employees there to relay this information to me! I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very rude customer service, never will come to this location again. Very Inappropriate music playing, not family friendly. Very brief statements were being mumbled from the employee, dont mean to blame. When she handed over my drink, there was some bread crumbs around the rim of the cup."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for great fresh food. Their service is fast so you can come to this location when you are on your lunch time. The subs are healthy which is a huge plus especially if you want to stay healthy."}
{"text":"Used to be my go to sandwich place, but it's not now.  Go in for breakfast sandwich on flat bread, corners hard as a rock after being toasted.  Counter person must own the place, bad when you count how many green peppers you put on a 6 inch sandwich, makes me feel like a burden with the personality they depict.   Sometimes I stopped late afternoon, the total opposite, have a foot long, wheat, good bread.  Younger workers, slap the ingredients all over the place.  Unreal.  Can't win, time to go to different sandwich shop. Good bye Subway"}
{"text":"We were just \"served\" by Donna who was extremely rude. She sighed and shook her head while making my sandwich, especially when reminding her that I wanted a six inch when she proceeded to slice a whole footlong. 
When it came time to pay I accidentally pushed a button for Apple pay. She sarcastically thanked me and told me we had to start ALL over again. 
The sandwich was great but wow the attitude really sucked! Get that girl an attitude change because I won't be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a breakfast sandwich around 11 they say they stopped serving breakfast sandwiches at exactly 11 I was really bummed besides that the service was good."}
{"text":"This is the worst Subway I've ever been in-I ordered a sub and wanted a side of rotisserie chicken and was told they couldn't sell it to me unless I put it on a sandwich-really? You have it and can't sell it! St checkout I asked if they accept the Buckeye card and the Mgr said we don't have them-duh I know I do! Wasn't very clean either."}
{"text":"Was looking for a Subway on my way to work, I was able to order online and just swing in and grab it.  Everything was made exactly as I specified and it was delicious.  The guy working was super nice too so that was a plus considering it was at like 7 in the morning."}
{"text":"They don't offer the veggie patty sandwich here and they rip you off if you use the buy one / get one free coupon for 6 inch subs. Isn't the point of a franchise restaurant knowing that you can get the same thing in every place?  Not true at this place, worse subway I've ever been too."}
{"text":"Would not allow me to use gift card to pay since card reader not working
Should've had a sign at the beginning of the line before I made on my sandwiches"}
{"text":"I really like going to this Subway.  Everyone is always super nice,  especially Chris.  Thanks for my awesome Turkey Italian!  Everything was perfect. The shop is always clean and service is fast and effiCient.  I go out if my way to eat at this one!"}
{"text":"Walked in, the guy taking his sweet time then slowly taking order from a lady that is ordering a a party Tray for lunch to pick up at noon and I'm waiting there like an idiot while he look at her tits as she fill up the damn paper acting like she doesn't know what to write!!!! Everybody know what turkey, beef, chicken mean in a piece of paper and she have a manager tag on her shirt so she is not an idiot, service 0"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, out of bread, out of meat. The guy have horrible attitude and have no training on how to add items to the sandwich, he just stock up the sandwich and throw it around :/"}
{"text":"Now I normally ever go to subway, so I gave them another chance today. Tried the flat bread with teriyaki chicken and provolone warmed up. Veggies where so-so and the dressings a little too sweet for my taste. I guess I'll stick to my mom&pop gourmet sandwiches that I love. Sorry team"}

{"text":"A solid place to grab a quick lunch located in a convenient shopping plaza close to Red Rock Canyon.  I was on a (yet another) training bike ride and was coming back from Blue Diamond when the stomach started telling me to get food quickly.  I spotted the Subway, thought it would be a short stop, and walked in.  There were only a few customers ahead of me, but despite that, it took well over 15 minutes to place my order, then another 5-10 minutes to receive order and pay for it.  None of the orders before me were large or labour intensive, so I was wondering why it took so long to get my \"fast\" food sandwich.  Perhaps I was bordering on being \"hangry?\"  Oh well.  The cookies made up for my wait."}
{"text":"This is the WORSE Subway I ever ate at! The salads come in 6\" and footlong sizes... they charged me a foot long size and put 6\" size meat in it. When I asked about it the lady said they sell 6\" size and charge for a foot long because they use foot long veggies. What a RIP OFF! I get Subway salads other places that are wonderful and the menus on line clearly shows two size salads. Don't ever eat there. Very bad manners also!!!!"}
{"text":"Ronaldo is so bad. It was the worst sandwich ever. This place is the worst subway. I don't know why they hire retarts that can't do their job as simple as making simple sandwich. Very disappointed and awful service."}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast... a lot. Lynda and her team are fantastic! They're always smiling, friendly, and some of them know me by name. Like I said, I'm here a lot. Their vegetables are always fresh. I really like the 3\" flatbread breakfast sandwiches. They're quick to make my food and usually know what I want on it without even having to ask me and Lynda always has iced tea ready for me at 8:00am. I really appreciate it! 

It's like Cheers! But with sandwiches. Five stars... I love this place."}
{"text":"This was the worst reuben sandwich I've ever had, and quite possibly the worst sandwich I've ever tried anywhere! (because there was no way I could finish it!)  For starters, they didn't have the rye bread. Then, the server kept repeating the same questions about my preferences on the sandwich, even after I had stated them to him. It was  a very frustrating experience. The meat didn't even taste like corned beef and the sauerkraut just tasted like some cabbage with vinegar sprinkled over it. Thousand Island was horrible, may have even gone bad. Worst of all, I was sick within 30 minutes of eating this nasty concoction, what of it I managed to consume. Take this limited edition away, PLEASE! As for this location, not the pleasant, friendly, courteous service I've experienced at other Subways. I will not return. I would NEVER recommend this Subway!"}
{"text":"This is the best Subway by a landslide. There is a nice young man that typically works weekend nights named Calvin that always brightens my day. Careful subway, I may try recruit him to my company for customer service! He's great at connecting with customers and often remembers specific conversational details that keeps me coming back. 

Always a pleasant experience and always a great sandwich. I *especially* appreciate that the veggie delight is always $3. Since it's never on the $3 6 inch deal list, it makes sense to count it every day! Not all subways honor this mentality and I get really frustrated at other locations. 

I've been going to this one for about ten years and their staff right now is really on point in comparison to earlier years."}
{"text":"What happened to this place!?!? They were so good when I moved here 3-4 years ago.  Please wash your hands after handling the register. I just can't.."}
{"text":"some of the employees are actually great. the owner is a money hungry bitch. i would NEVER want to deal with her ever again. she should not be an owner of any company. she also owns the one in Elyria walmart too, so beware of that. i wouldn't eat at any of her stores if they were the LAST place on earth. horrible person!!!!"}
{"text":"Standard Subway but the ladies there were extremely nice, which is just great, esp in fast food :)
Trans-Friendly B+ sure thing"}
{"text":"Update May 2016: You know what this location does right? When you specifically ask for extra green peppers and olives they give you extra damn green peppers and olives.
And when you get more veggies they don't pretend that they can't fit any more toppings on your sub. They press that mutha effin' sandwich DOWN and they FORCE more toppings on.
Yea...
This location isn't stingy about the veggies. And why should they be? It's bagged vegetables. (But you'd be surprised at other locations...).


____
Nothin wrong with this location.
When I ask for \"a lot of olives\" they actually give me a lot of olives.

I'm totally going to raise my review to 4 stars if they keep this up.
I'm really into olives."}
{"text":"No coupon no food.
No loss anyway cause it's Subway after all
Not very polite about it either"}
{"text":"Couple nights ago I placed a mobile order, pick up said 8:22pm, I arrived at 8:30. The teen with dark blonde hair and brushed to the side didn't greet me, the first thing he said was that my 2nd sandwich wasn't done because I took too long to order on the mobile app and the pick up time didn't push. Not my fault. I kindly told him I had nowhere to be and I didn't mind waiting. Got home and my sandwich (the first one made) was literally rock hard. The bread crumbled completely into pieces when I tried to take a bite. I couldn't even remove my sandwich from the wrapper because it was stuck to it. I also didn't order avocado but it was on there. Good thing I'm not allergic! I'm all about second chances so I went in tonight, same rude teenager made my sandwich and I don't know his name because he was the only one not wearing a name tag. Tonight he stood there and said nothing like it was more work to ask me what kind of bread and toppings I wanted. He also threw a knife into the back kitchen sick and made an unnecessary loud noise for everyone in the restaurant. Israel was another guy working and had he not been there to show a little customer service I would have walked out. How dare that guy make customers feel bad and embarrassed when I'm trying to spend my hard earned money at this establishment. I'll be driving the extra few miles to go to jimmy johns instead from now on."}
{"text":"Walter is the greatest!!!!! He was super fast without being pushy, he was extremely caring and entertaining, and he gave us some really great suggestions! Be lucky you have an awesome guy working for you, Subway. I'd love to steal him for my restaurant in a heart beat!!!! Thanks for the experience Walter! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Dirty dining room, empty tea canister, no lids for cups and a slightly squished sub called a panini!  Usually this location is pretty good but tonight there are at least 4 workers, no customers yet plenty of issues. Total fail and bad choice for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Today I go in to this location first time since last year. Last year I had rude service, things haven't changed. When asked a question about a coupon I got in my phone then asked for a $3. She couldn't have been more rude yelling at me saying I \"can't have both, either the coupon or the sandwich\". If that's true it could have been said kinder. I won't be going back there. I have a subway near my job who would have given me both. You can thank Corina for the 2 stars. She was at least the kind sandwich maker."}
{"text":"The people of this particular location are rude. There's no other way to put it you can walk in and get a great sandwich and the second you leave the counter and get away from the people there working there everything is fine . It just unfortunately this is not the first time that I've gotten rude service and because it's so convenient to where I live I'll probably go back and just bite my tongue to get my food and leave. I think you need to remember that the customers make or break your business."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Subway restaurant. Nothing out of the ordinary. Standard menu options. Fast and friendly service. Clean and usually empty. I'll go back to this location the next time I'm in the area and craving a sandwich."}
{"text":"Normally this location is pretty good but it seems like the service is not very good unless the manager is there. Today he was there. I ordered 2 lunches. A salad and a sub. The salad had no LETTUCE wth is a salad without lettuce??? When I picked it up the lady that made it rushed me out the door. I got in the car with my friend and said I feel like they just said get the hell out. I called after driving home and getting the yummy discovery.She thought it was weird so she looked at the online order and said \"my bad\" come back I'll make a new one. No it's gross and going in the trash. I asked for a refund on my friends cc but no they can only give me a new salad. After that I might not eat anything healthy again!!  it was my idea to go to subway"}
{"text":"Generous with toppings. Attitude a little harsh but hey! It's a subsidized government chain that feeds off our tax dollars to employee and train the sandwich artist."}
{"text":"Man, after being disappointed with the previous place I went to get dinner I decided to come to Subway. Always get the footlong Tuna with pickles, olives, extra onions and an extra scoop of Tuna. Now I'm all for portion control and saving on food cost but and this is a huge but when I order and extra scoop of Tuna and tell the young man I'll pay for the extra onions he tells me there isn't a button for that.. literally 6 olive slices, 5 pieces of pickles, and no onions. Yes I watched him make it - only reason I paid was because i wasn't in the mood to argue. Never coming back to this subway. I fact I'll go hungry rather then coming back to this place. 

If your guest is willing to pay.. load that shit up! Look at the picture and tell me this is an okay portion size for toppings. Tell me this is an acceptable sandwich. 

To bad the store on Vegas and Buffalo isn't owned by the same franchiser."}
{"text":"Worst subway of any I have visited. I have many years of eating at subway all over the country and even in England once. I've had 2 bad experiences here at this location. About a year ago I went in and they had no bread. They claimed that they ran out. How the F does subway run out of bread. It's literally their main item. My 2nd bad experience was 2 days ago. I got stale bread. Again, bread is their main item.  How can they serve stale bread? They really suck at their job!  I would avoid this location and go to any other location."}
{"text":"I am a frequent Subway patron, but I will not patron this franchise again.

I am also a supporter of our local High School sports teams. When I presented a discount card from Boulder Creek HS, the manager REFUSED to honor the card.

Please do not support this Subway franchise as they do not support our schools and sports teams."}
{"text":"What is different about this Subway?

1. Very small space, forget finding a table at lunch time. Lines out out the door.

2. I think they have new owners or managers, and that may not be a good thing. They used to be generous with toppings and sauces (not overly generous, but in line with other Subways). Now they are VERY stingy... very little sauce, small amounts of all toppings, etc. Seriously, I think my \"sandwich artist\" was counting black olives.

3. Stingy with the meat. I typically get the sweet onion chicken, and they now make darn sure when portioning the chicken they don't allow one small piece to stock out of the already small scoop. My last sub did not have more than 6 medium-small sized pieces of chicken. I think the other subs with pre-portioned meat are fine.

I like subway, but look for different location (about 3 mi. south)."}
{"text":"Only average. They don't take Subway gift cards though. What's up with that?? Be prepared for a wait if you stop in at lunchtime. Typical Subway."}
{"text":"The wait times, service and overall experience at this location is MEH. Unfortunately I work nearby so I feel limited on my choices. Bottom line, this location doesnt screen their employees and its shows by how poorly they make sandwiches. No artists at this location!"}
{"text":"Just called (9:20, their site advertises that they are open until 10:00) to make sure their hours where correct online. I asked \"how late are you guys open tonight?\" He said \"we are starting to put everything away. We close at 10\" I asked him \"so you are putting everything away 40 mins early?\" He said \"we close at 10. We're putting some things away but we can serve you if you come in now.\" 
Disappointing service. I'll spend my money elsewhere and drive to a different subway. Working in the service industry, you make a customer feel welcome, wanted and satisfied until every customer has left the store. You don't pressure them not to come or make them feel restricted. Definitely won't spend my money at this location. Look at past reviews people. 


****just called the subway in 29th and they welcomed me until 10:00! Very professional employee on the other line!"}
{"text":"Super bummed. It took FOREVER to find parking (not subways fault, just inconvenient) so by the time I found a spot I was just ready for a good sandwich. Got in there and they said \"hello\" and then continued their convo, she put on gloves and went through what i wanted, while the lady at the registers phone went off over and over. I tried to make small talk \"how's your day?\" And she didn't even look up at me, said something I couldn't hear and then continued talking with the other lady. Asked for *A LOT* of pickles (don't judge me, I like pickles!) she put a regular amount, I asked for more and she pinched a few more from the bucket, didn't really seem to want to give me anymore. Paid $10 for my order and the cashier had some sort of Bluetooth in her ear, as I filled my drink I realized she was on the phone. Rude. Got home and the bread is stale. I get that subway isn't everyone's ideal job but maybe they could hire people that know how to at least ACT like they want to be there. I'll drive a little further up the road to the other location next time for sure."}
{"text":"The prior owner of this location was nut job. The new owner has really stepped up, yes their are high school and college kids that work there at night. It is Subway! Honestly, the prices are always consistent, I am a picky sub eater, they make my subs as I ask all the time, consistently. If you are reading this review, you know this was a nice location run by a psycho path prior to 2013. The drive thru addition is a nice touch especially during the frigid winter months! I really feel that the new owner has invested in this location and should be recognized for his turn around efforts!"}
{"text":"Nice friendly environment with great service! Speedy sandwiches that look good and taste even better! Love eating fresh at this local subway!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by to have a late night dinner (11:30pM) and when we entered the restaurant I noticed the man working had a sweater on and no subway shirt. We ordered our food and while ordering we had to repeat ourselves a few times since he had headphones on. I don't think it was to appropriate to have headphones on with no subway shirt and to not wash your hands before making a sandwich for a customer. My overall experience with this subway was very disappointing."}
{"text":"This subway had fresh bread and fresh vegetables. I truly believe this is  one of the best subways in phoenix. Also thank you wayne you where great"}
{"text":"This place is still open.. I just ordered doordash from here, ate and now I'm throwing up. May as well be closed"}
{"text":"Subway is a sandwich Sub shop. I had coupons and they were NOT honoring them. My son didn't have a coupon and he paid $19 for 2 sub sandwiches plus 2 med drinks.   I think he was overcharged.  And the girl that was training her was too busy catering to a friend. I ate my meal, took my time and observed. The trainer, left for lunch with friend, leaving the new hire to handle the store.  Im going to try the coupons once more at this store. THEN I will hopefully give this store a better review."}
{"text":"Long wait the first time I went here.  I'm not sure how to order a Subway sandwich through the drive through, but I'm willing to try!"}
{"text":"This subway sucks!!! They got my order wrong and refused to return it!!! They told me they couldn't even fix it!  Dont go to this subway!!! They obviously don't know what customer service is and if I could give no stars I would!!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience every time we come in. Damon is always personable and makes our visits great after a long night at work. The store is always clean and everything is in stock. Never have had any issues."}
{"text":"After visiting 3 different franchise locations in 1 week (yes.. nothing screams more \"single\" and \"sad\" than visiting subway 3 times in 1 week), I have decided that this is not the best location nor the worst.

They don't put on enough veggies on this sub. Even when asked for more.
They aren't terrible though."}
{"text":"By far one of the cheapest Subways franchise locations- it's cheap lettuce topping- PUT MORE ON. I just don't understand franchise locations that decide they will put little to no veggies on for the sake of saving a few cents. I hate locations that do this and rely on the franchise name to keep them in business.

There's no reason why I should be eating so much subway- but after visiting 3 different locations in 1 week I was actually insulted at how little veggies they gave me, even AFTER I asked for \"a lot\" and \"more\".
I literally had to scoop out the veggies on one side of my footling to put on the OTHER side of my sandwich to enjoy it. Then took the other half of my sandwich home and added more veggies.

(PS: I worked at subway when I was teenager- I know what a reasonable amount of toppings are)."}
{"text":"You wouldn't believe how good a Subway sandwich tastes after 4 or 5 days of constantly eating in sit-down restaurants in Vegas.

They work fast and use fresh ingredients.

Not much to complain about."}
{"text":"I was running some Errands out in Gilbert and it was far past lunch time. So I thought, I will stop at the next place I see.
There it was Subway located inside a strip mall. 
As soon as I walked in I noticed how clean it was. There were several customers inside and it was nicely decorated.
I really do not know how long it has been there since I do not get out here too often. But, now with all the new building it is getting very busy out in these parts.

Anyway, Vijay was my sandwich maker. He did a great job. One thing they do not carry Gluten Free, which is something I think everyone should go to now. I got the Philly Steak Sandwich and you can get anything you want on it which I think is great!  He even toasted it for me. Napkins are not out so you have to ask for them.  
I keep noticeing this in a lot of places. I don't know why, but I hate not having enough.  
However, he gave me more and I was on my way. Food tasted fresh and that is all I ask for.
Lots of parking in the lot. I wish they still did the punch cards for Subway, but I know that went away a long time ago."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the lunch and man it was slammed.  I was hesitant at first to get in the long line but once I did it moved super fast.  The man making my sandwich was also very friendly.  Probably the nicest subway employee I've ever met.  Over all it was a good experience for subway, parking is kinda crazy though."}
{"text":"Normally I'd say this is a good lunch option but today's purchase was ... wait for it .... 
sub par! 
The bread tasted stale or old ... had a tough or hard consistency to it. The tuna was good but the toppings looked freezer burnt. The cucumber was old - looked like it had been cut days ago & was almost spoiling. 
The lettuce was not fresh looking. My guess is the new shops down the road have slowed business and they are in trouble! 
It will be awhile before I go there again .."}
{"text":"All the staff is super friendly and helpful.  I eat here several times a week and I'm super happy they are in my neighborhood.   Thanks for all the great sammiches."}
{"text":"I eat here rather frequently, (maybe 3-4 times a month) and the food is good, but the service is always lacking. The Native American dude who appears to be the manager seems to have all the personality of a clenched fist, and you have to beg to have your order bagged! Yeah, I'm gonna carry all that in my arms....NOT!   Here's a tip; Smile, engage with the people who keep you in business, and bag their purchases!!"}
{"text":"I come here during lunch hours. The line moves fast and the food is fresh. Can't go wrong with this Subway location."}
{"text":"The food was ok, the guys behind the counter had to smile or enthusiasm, very blah. Both of them had their head phones in, which probably explains it. Other than that there was a hair in my food:(."}
{"text":"This place is always very clean and the 2 gals over the last 3 days were both extremely friendly! I work at the tanning salon a few doors down and can't really go over there and wait in line so I'm able to call ahead so I can be in and out and they've made sure my order was always ready to go and I appreciate that BIG time being in customer service :) they make you feel welcome and that's always a great thing.. Very rare to find people who actually care about their guests in this city! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Easy Friday night dinner for the kiddos! (Cause come on, what parent realllllly wants to cook and clean on a Friday night?!!)

Kiddos love the kids meals here, they each get what they want, chips and drink are included! Throw in some cookies and its a good meal for under 20$! Good location, clean, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Usually I would say how can you go wrong with subways? Until I came to this location! I have given this location several tries and although the food is standard, the ordering process is a battle. There is an employee who is a friend or relative of the owner and always working. Not only do you have to shout your order to her, she also gets it wrong and you have to correct her throughout. Although this location is conveniently located near my workplace, I skip it for other options nearby as the ordering process is too frustrating. The owner is always beside her and sees the numerous issues customers have with ordering but doesn't seem to think she should be given other duties instead of making the sandwiches so he's lost my business."}
{"text":"This is the stingiest Subways I have every been to.  You would think that small handful of spinach was going to cost them so much it would bankrupt them. Employees are not friendly but not unfriendly ... Just neutral. Beware manager/possibly the owner she seems to have an attitude problem."}
{"text":"$7.99 for a 12 inch roast beef but there was so little meat, I honestly could not tell what kind of a sandwich I was eating.  My complaint got me a blank stare.   Adios."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are always fresh and tasty, vegies are also fresh, the restaurant is clean, and the service is great.  If you are in the neighborhood and want to go to a Subway for a quick sub, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"A Subway is a Subway is a Subway... This one is actually really great though. We just opened an office near here so we'll be here a lot in the future, and have already come twice just in the last few days. 

The service here is great, super friendly employees. Their ingredients taste SUPER fresh and so do their cookies. Glad this is the one that's so close to us rather than one of the not-so-great ones..."}
{"text":"It's true. Despite what I'm sure is a corporate goal, not all Subways are created equal.  I'd imagine what separates the good from the bad would be ownership and/or management (like nearly every business on the planet).  This Subway certainly seems to treat the employees right as this location is always busy and quick to get you through the line.  

I have another Subway location closer to work but this is my preferred location. They have nice though limited outdoor seating area (that could use a little more attention since the birds seem to be plentiful in the area) and the inside is always clean and a little larger than what most Subways seem to have.

I hear they have an assortment of sandwiches to choose from but its been years since I had anything but my favorite: Footlong meatball with extra pepperoni, (not toasted, of course) pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, JALAPEÑOS! And a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese. Grabs some chips, a large tea and head outside to enjoy the wonderful Phoenix weather!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Suncoast Hotel, this has become one of our preferred places to grab a bite to eat when we stay here due to the variety, prices, service, freshness of ingredients."}
{"text":"The manager here is a complete bitch. The kid helping me had been there 2 days and his manger is yelling at him like he's been a bad employee for years! ...he was good, wasn't rude, made my sandwich right..I felt bad for him honestly, that's not how the workplace usually is. Never going back"}
{"text":"I work right around the corner from this location. Every time I've stopped by here the staff is very nice and courteous. The only complaint I have is that they are very stingy with toppings. Are they trained to be this way? I got a veggie delight which means shouldn't the sub be loaded with veggies since I'm getting no meat ? I asked for pickles they gave me legit 4, so i said extra pickles and ended up getting 7. Just please be more generous with the toppings :)"}
{"text":"Not really sure about the concept of paying for someone to make your basic meat and cheese sandwich at the best of times...maybe I should be paying someone to do my dishes?
 This location is perfectly capable at what it does; I just don't want to pay good money for such a basic \"service\". Bread is fine, meat seems fresh, toppings are varied.
 The last time I really enjoyed a sub was at uni in the mid 70s. Mr. Sub on Bloor stayed open really late and they had, wait for it, a microwave! That meant you could get a scalding hot roast beef sub at midnight...assuming you were sober enough to walk half a mile."}
{"text":"In the context of fast food joints and other Subway restaurants this place is fantastic.  The staff are always friendly and will always greet you the moment you walk in the door.  The dining area is always clean.  Prices are inline with other fast food in the area.  And the food itself is as good as can be at a Subway.  (I miss the days when the bread was baked in the store!)"}
{"text":"This Subway is absolutely terrible.  The employees give the impression that they could care less about your business.  In fact, it almost seems if they'd rather not be bothered by you coming in.  We only go to Subway to get our kids meatball sandwiches.  We have been there on three separate occasions in the past month and they were out of meatballs.  Out of meatballs?? It's like the time I went to McDonald's and they were out of french fries.  Oh that's right that has NEVER happened!  PLEASE do yourself a favor and never, ever, ever, ever go to the Subway at 4844 S Val Vista Dr Ste #108 Gilbert AZ 85298.  I promise you will thank me for it!!"}
{"text":"This place needs to have a phone number added. It's been here forever and no way to contact them"}
{"text":"Fresh sub for a great price! 

So you build your own sandwich here. You choice what kind of bread and size between a 6in or foot long. Then you add your meat & cheese and veggies & sauces/spices. You can also ask them to toast your sandwich if you like. Also they make salads, pizzas, breakfast sandwiches. 

My favorite sandwich is the Italian B.M.T. On Italian bread. With tomatoes, lettuce, spinach, cucumbers, pickles, banana peppers, & green peppers. Also I like to add mayo & oil/vinaigrette & salt/pepper & oregano. 

Also sometimes they have soup, sometimes. I love their broccoli & cheese soup. 

Also they have chips and drinks & cookies. 

They have daily deals. They sometimes change. 

Sign up for their reward program. Also if you sign up for their text messages they send you coupons to use."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Subway where they have been out of so many things. When I went in they were out of chicken, Italian herbs and cheese bread, and dollar bills. It was the middle of the day on a Saturday so this was inexcusable for me. The service was also incredibly slow. It took me nearly 15 minutes to get my sandwich. It was a painful experience, that's for sure. The only thing that saves this place is its location. Besides that, their service definitely needs some work."}
{"text":"This marks the last time I'll ever eat at a Subway. And I want to make it absolutely clear it's not the fault of the gentleman working here. 

There was a line and he was the only dude working. He didn't know how to efficiently serve three or more people because there was no obvious way. You could tell he was stressed... because he DID care, but he didn't know what to do. 

When I asked for the steak, he had to squeeze the meat together to get it to break apart. I made a face and asked him why that was happening, he said \"because it's frozen.\" I'm a freaky fellow... so I was able to stomach the concept. But yuck. 

Subway is an absolutely disgusting establishment that doesn't seem to be attempting improvements in any way. I travel for a living and there are sooo many Subway places it becomes a survival technique to visit one. But no more. 

Subway... what's up? Can you get it together? You're competing with establishments with great service and fresh foods, at a remarkably similar price point. And can you actually staff your restaurants?"}
{"text":"Wow, I've never had the problems as a previous reviewer and I've eaten here for the past 4 years. It's been so long that I know the owners and they are really friendly people! Place is packed for lunch when schools have half days though so watch out for that!"}
{"text":"Why did you stop offering spicy mustard as an option? The sand which maker said they don't have it anymore. I'd rather go to port of subs now. Bad idea"}
{"text":"15 people IN line at 2pmish. Only 2 people working here. No wonder Port of Subs is over taking Subway. Horrible customer service. Hire more people so you don't have customers walking out because the line takes 30 minutes. Don't go here unless you have an hour to wait"}
{"text":"I went to this Subway before with my Wingman and the meatball sub were excellent and the staff was supper friendly to us and the service was good. We will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"This location used to be wonderful. We came in quite frequently because the staff and service was great. However, in the last six months every attempt to dine here has been awful. I'm pretty sure every person that has prepared our meals has been high out of their minds. I've never had to remind someone of what they were doing or what I've said 3 times. I'm sure being a \"sandwich artist\" isn't the greatest job out there, but let get it together kids, it's a great job while you're in school. Focus on your grades, do your job, learn to pay your bills and for gods sake quit smoking pot in the freezers."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write a review for this particular Subway location. The food is the same as expected but the employees are the exception. I always forget to write down the names of the gentlemen that work there but they are the reason I go back again and again. 

My daughter loves Subway already but these guys will make whatever crazy sandwich she wants that day where other locations will only create to the already set sandwich menu. They smile and laugh each time but are always willing to make it to order for her.

If you like Subway and think outside the sandwich box, I am sure these gentleman can keep up. Well done."}
{"text":"My go-to Subway when I'm super hungry and haven't brought lunch. This Subway location has limited seating (it's upstairs) but it's good for takeout. They usually have everything and the workers are consistent and nice. However, I do see uncleanliness and unsanitary things which I wish I didn't see. For example, touching one's phone then touching the bread barehanded from the oven. Or when they don't change gloves and the same glove used to open the oven is the same glove to touch the food. Also, there's major cross contamination when the same knife is being used to close and cut the sandwiches. I'll probably return because this location is convenient but they could definitely improve on their cleanliness and keep everything sanitary which is especially important when handling food."}
{"text":"The best subway I've eaten at. Really soft delicious bread. And its pretty cheap compared to other places to eat at on the strip. Plus they are open 24/7. So that even better"}
{"text":"One star is to high for this place.  I have to give the young man, Adam, working alone credit for getting all the orders done even though it was done slowly.  If I had know that only one guy works here and their prices are so high for a freaking sandwich sub I would have gone somewhere else like Farmer Boys down the street.  Paying nearly $40 for three foot longs and a half a sandwich for a kid is way to much.  Not coming back here any time soon. Need to shut this place down.  Why is this freaking review in Filipino?"}
{"text":"Good service and yummy subs. I have been to this location a few times and it is never busy and we get helped right away."}
{"text":"Okay, so everyone knows subway makes decent sandwiches for a reasonable price.... But did you know they serve a pretty decent breakfast?  I was sitting in the O'so long drive-thru line for Starbucks and looked in the window for subway and there was no one there!  Since I was running late, I decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  For $2.50 I got a coffee and breakfast sandwich with egg whites on a whole wheat English muffin. This same order at starbucks would have been about $8.   Starbucks still trumps with better coffee, but the breakfast sandwich at subway was better than the one I normally get at starbucks, made fresh, and about half the calories.  This was also one of the cleanest subway locations I have ever been to, and the service was great too."}
{"text":"Who is the GM of this place?? I literally waited 20 minutes at drive through, no word from the girl who took my order so I drove off! Not only that but there were no clients inside. Did she take a cigarette break after taking my order?? This is ridiculous! Even the car behind me who was there 10 minutes after I arrived, drove off as well. The other day too I was there around 1am and the kid upfront took forever and had this nonchalant attitude, I recorded it just in case I run into the manager one day but actually after today I'm done with this place!"}
{"text":"These guys are so friendly and kind. Go here  everyday. Wish they would staff a little more poor guys are swamped"}
{"text":"Came early, 10am, and everything was fresh. The guy working was super friendly and helped everyone that came in right away. The bread was fresh which is awesome considering they are open 24 hrs you never know what you're going to get. The drink station area was a mess and needed cleaned up."}
{"text":"Had the 6 inch turkey today was very good and nice service thank you subway was in and out in 10 minutes"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots while I'm at work. Even though I work downtown, I make the drive up Charleston to eat here when I'm craving a sub. Even though it's super tiny and looks like a shack from the outside, it is probably the best location I've been to in town because of the efficiency of the staff. There are usually only 2 people working during lunch and still they are able to serve a small line of customers, man a drive thru window and still get orders out quickly. Most people take their orders to go since there are only 4 or 5 seats at a counter, so I'm usually the only one eating in the restaurant. The manager here is really nice and always seems happy to be there even though he's at work! The only downside is the parking...since this is such a small location, there are only about 3 spots in front. If those are full, you have to park in a nearby shopping center and walk over."}
{"text":"Of all three subways in the area this is the worst.  Savannah the girl who makes sandwiches has got to be the worst sandwich maker in all the subways I've ever visited all over the country.  You have to repeat your order over and over. I even told her cucumbers and she put pickles on my sandwich. It's not just a one time thing, but the other few times I've come it's been the same thing. Ill just have to make sure I go to the other subways from now on. This one just happens to have a Winchell's donuts inside. That was the reason I went."}
{"text":"On the occasions where I'm in the mood for a fresh sub, this place is a good alternative. Yes it's franchise, corporate owned but does the trick. Nice, clean and good customer service. Always fresh ingredients available."}
{"text":"Alright, so I'm not a huge subway fan, but my husband is and he LOVES them.

Why? I never really knew, since I think i make a bangin' sandwich, if i do say so myself (thats my PRIDE talking) but it is nice to go and not have to do any of the work.

Subway used to have TONS of 5 dollar subs but now theyre are far and few and I understand it. Food prices are going up and i never knew how they could do it so cheap considering workers pay, food prices and space rentals.. BUT anyway..

This subway is my favorite. They have a drive thru that makes it super easy to get your sandwich if your tight on time and its 24 hours. Yes ladies and gentlemen no more excues or late night junk food after clubbing, work or drinking, when you can drive thru to a subway.

The employees are so friendly and i always tip them because they have failed to make a mistake and theyre sandwiches just taste a bit better than other subways.

What dont i like, but its not their fault? That its connected to a winchells! yes, talk about hell. here i am trying to keep on my diet and i cant even walk in because my nose smells the fresh baked donuts and my fast ass wants one. such a tease! thank goodness for drive thru.

Favorite? Italian sandwich and theyre new pastrami melt. Nom NOM nom. I may just drive over now and over myself some subway."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Where do I begin. First off let me start by saying the experience I had today at this location was horrendous by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had.... I arrived at 9:30pm. The hours on the door clearly state they close at 10:00pm. I walk through the door and the first thing I hear is \"oh no are you kidding me!!\" From a man in the back. I automatically think huh. Okay ... After the man tinkers around in the back for several minutes he comes out into my view he doesn't even come up to the counter and greet me.. He stands there with the look of disgust and just stares at me.. I said \"Hello are you closed?\" He replies with \"YES I already put everything away\" he immediately turns and walks away. He did not even give me a chance to say anything. I then look down at my phone and see that it's 9:37pm. I looked around for a number to call I couldn't find anything. The man went back into the freezer. As I was about to leave a woman came out from the back and into my view and asked me immediately if I needed help. I replied with \"well yes I was looking to get a sandwich however that man said you were closed\" Roxy then replies \"no I'm sorry we are open how can I help you\" at this point I was extremely upset and wanted to walk out. However I didn't want to take my frustration out on this wonderful woman. I replied with \"well he said you were closed ..\" Roxy says \"No, we're open how many I help you\". She made my sandwich apologized to me and was so nice and so thankful that I didn't walk out  if it was not for Roxy. I would have. The mans name was KYLE!!! He has 0 customer service skills WORST I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED!!!!!!!!!!
People are out of work and in need of jobs. This is NOT someone that should be working with people!!!! I will NOT be back to this location AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Subway since it opened and through many staff changes it has consistently provide good food and great service. The employees are friendly and attentive and the shop is clean.."}
{"text":"Very nice clean Subway. Staff was friendly but a little slow and my wife actually made a comment on how skimpy they were with the veggies (this from a 110 lb waif). You could do worse than this Subway. Recommend."}
{"text":"Is a kiss just a kiss?  Is every Subway created equal?  I think not. Despite living in the area for seven years and being a big Subway fan, I had never been to this one.  Walked in at 12:30 PM in the heat of the lunch hour rush and there must have been a dozen people in front of me.  I wasn't in a hurry so I settled in for what I thought would be at least a little wait.  Not really, they had the place staffed with a great crew, everyone was extemely friendly, made a great sandwich and I found a clean table to eat at.  They offer fresh brewed ice tea and have a cooler full of other beverage options.

Subway does a great job of being consistent on the food at their restaurants, but it's the attention to details at the franchisee level that makes the difference and this one is definitely a gem.  Looking forward to going back (and it'll be sooner than seven years)."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a month. Typical Subway, no weaknesses- it is what it is- a Subway. Always clean and a nice welcome upon entering. Good ice tea selection"}
{"text":"I live close, so instead of Burger King, I went to Subway sounded less greasy. I not only saw at least 3 homeless people who smelled like pee, but the guy who was making my \"sub\" had hickeys all over his neck. I get it, sometimes it happens but the hickeys where fresh...all I could think of the whole time he was making my sandwich is he had his hands up some girls coochie less then 24 hours ago, he seemed like a nice enough employee but I paid for my food and walked out, and dropped it in the trash, just like the girl that he did last night."}
{"text":"This was the WORST experience I have ever had with customer service!! The WORST subway I have ever been to. My sister and I walked into the subway at 9:25, 35 minutes before they closed. As soon as we walked in the two girls working there had the WORST attitude, they Did not say one word to us, as we were ordering they started slamming the lids onto the veggies for closing and it was only 930. The girl who helped us either MAKENZIE OR KENZIE was the rudest worker I have ever came across. She slapped sandwiches together, tearing and ripping the bread, trying to rush the whole time making it obvious she wanted to get out! She was incredibly rude the whole time and never once made eye contact. She literally threw are sandwiches together and  toasted them with the meat halfway off. When I asked for more sauce, she picked up the oil bottle and squeezed half of the bottle into the middle of my sandwich. My sister wanted salt and pepper, she covered it in pepper. Also my sister asked for chipotle sauce and she squeezed a large amount lazily and missed half the sandwich. Truly the worst service we have ever received. Our sandwiches were not edible, we threw them away and went to the subway on union hills and will never return again. Crazy!!"}
{"text":"Nick is the best employee. He makes sure to take care of my sweet six inch delight. He hooks it up with the veggies and special sauce."}
{"text":"Subway of the day is a great deal.
I got a gift card over Xmas. And trying subway for afternoon snack. Not bad. The ingredient is plentiful and only 3.99 for half foot. 
Also, if you did the survey from the receipt you will get a free cookie. The portion is not what the previous review said , it is acceptable. 

Overall. This place is clean and comfortable. No a 5 stars but its average"}
{"text":"This is a nice Subway location. 

My mom and I occasionally stop in for subs in the evening at this location and I have nothing but good things to say about it. They get orders going quickly, they follow instructions from customers, and the service is good overall. 

I have never had an issue with the employees there. They are all pretty friendly and the store itself is always clean. I've never seen it dirty or unorganized. The sandwiches I get always are great and overall, this is one of the better Subway locations in my view. 

I will definitely be back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Subway is a royal piece of shit!! 

They pretent to be healthy but they use trans fat in all of their food. 

Butter and natural vegetable oil is metabolizable. 

I cant believe they wont do the right thing and take it out of thier food. 

It is banned in many countries and in multiple states here. 

F you Subway!"}
{"text":"This location is right next to a froyo place in the same plaza as Whole Foods and a Starbucks. It's cleaner than some other Subway locations I've been to and three staff members were on hand to take my order. One helpful employee even gave me two coupons good for my next visit. :)"}
{"text":"Me: Wow, that guy really hated us.
Husbster: Well, it's not easy being an artist.

We came here out of lazy desperation. I wanted something junky, but not quite McDonald's junky. Enter Subway... junk food disguised as healthy-ish food. 

We split a footlong pizza sub (not sure if you heard, but these are $5) on a flatbread bun. Every request we made seemed to sink our Sandwich Artist into deeper and deeper despair. Cheese only on half the bread? Sad. Toasted? Sadder. Black olives on my half? Tears. It's quite possible that after he left, he sat in the corner of the back room rocking himself and listening to \"All By Myself\" on repeat.

By the time we brought our sandwich home, the toasted flatbread was already soggy. The pizza sub meat was also insanely salty to the point where it may have burnt my tongue. I couldn't finish the thing even though 6 inches is rarely a problem for me. (heh) 

This subway is now off my list of places I can eat at in this area. I'd rather hit Da Maria across the street... the service sucks but at least their sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy. Just your regular Subway locates inside of Walmart. There is plenty of seating and an allocated location to park shopping carts if you're picking something up after you're done shopping. There's a buzzer to get their attention if they're in the back."}
{"text":"I go to this Subway regularly because it is right by the Cronkite school and one of the only food options in the area. The guys that work there are super friendly and they always welcome you into the store. It gets busy around lunch time due to the amount of students that go through here but the employees work fast and you usually aren't waiting for long. I think this location has given me the best service out of any Subway location I've been to and because of that I will continue going here regularly."}
{"text":"Every once and a while I get a subway sandwich but I've really become a fan of their flat bread breakfast sandwich and was quite surprised it was so tasty!  They have a 6' inch flat bread and a 3' inch which is what I usually get with egg whites, turkey and veggies, toasted and served all for around $2.25.  I just love the breakfast variety uptown...... yum!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. The management here needs to train their staff big time. We walked in and immediately I see two customers ordering sandwiches and one girl making their sandwiches VERY SLOWLY. Also behind the counter is the  \"supervisor\" on duty, who is on the phone enjoying herself while more people come in to get their sandwiches behind a backed up line. 

After 15 mins of watching this girl make SLOW as possible sandwiches for two demanding customers who want everything just so, another customer walks in. We casually tell her we have been waiting almost 20 mins and she says loudly \"Oh no I have to get going I can't wait that long.\" 

Then by some miracle the \"supervisor\" gets off the phone and helps move the line along built up by this SLOW AS A SNAIL girl. The \"supervisor\" makes my boyfriend's sandwich in 8 seconds. Mine took 3 mins by this SLOW girl who struggled with avacado..... finally I told her to just wrap it up I have to go. 

Overall I can see the associates are not floor ready for speed and accuracy. I can see the \"supervisors\" are not trained with self awareness and leadership skills to build the business."}
{"text":"For a Subway, their food options aren't too shabby. They are one of the few that offer the black bean burger and sweet potato curry sauce - both 100% vegan!

I just wish when I get salads I didn't have to pay extra for the same amount of protein as a sandwich. 

So if you want to avoid all the calories and carbs in bread and end up with a salad, you get half the protein for the same price as a footlong - doesn't line up with their healthy motto."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! ZERO STARS!! No flatbread at 11am?! Okay, I'll get a panini. Nope. The MACHINE IS BROKEN!! Husband ordered Italian Hero, she had no clue how to make it, even though the sign has what kind of cheese goes on it. Finally go to pay, she can't take our phone number for the reward program THAT EVERY SUBWAY DOES! So we see the REWARD card sign-up and ask to start a new one since she doesn't know how to enter a phone number. NOPE. THEY HAVE THE REWARD CARD NEXT TO THE REGISTER AND SHE SAYS THEY DON'T DO IT AT THIS SUBWAY?! THEN AT LEAST DO NOT ADVERTISE A REWARD CARD PROGRAM AT THE REGISTER. Absolutely disappointing and frustrated at the lack of not only bread, but customer service. And a broken panini machine. So trashy in such a nice neighborhood. You'd think the owner would take some pride and fix the machine! Three times false advertising at this place. DO NOT GO HERE! Drive the extra mile and find a NICE, FRIENDLY SUBWAY!"}
{"text":"Manager is a complete idiot, if you buy a Subway card here IT WILL NOT WORK.  DO NOT BUY a subway card here or even bother using your credit card at this place.  I paid $80 for an unusable fraudulent card here.  Do not make the same mistake I did. Do not eat or shop at this Subway if you don't want to get ripped off.  I bought it card, both the website and their 1800# say it doesn't work, I tried to get my money back and they \"didn't know how to refund\" because the Manager was either too stupid to properly train the employees.  Now I ended up losing money trying to save money with their stupid card, do not trust this store!"}
{"text":"Going have to call the recently introduced Ruben a fail, rye bread has an awkward taste as does the thousand island dressing and sour kraut, the corned beef is ok."}
{"text":"I was a little worried about patronizing this Subway with all of the poor reviews, but they are all pretty old. So I went with three kids to buy sandwiches for a picnic at Lake in the Woods. Our food was fine, vegetables looked fresh, the store was clean, and the employees were super friendly and patient (I had three kids with me!). We were there a little before 1 pm on a Friday and there was no line. The employees' English was not fantastic, but we had no trouble placing our order.  No reason not to return."}
{"text":"My office goes to this Subway a lot. The team was recently completely replaced and we were kind of bummed about that. The previous team was always very friendly and quick. This new team is friendly but being that most are really new, service has slowed down."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Probably at least 20 years. It's right around the corner from my parents' house. It's always clean and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Came in this morning to order breakfast the old lady with the eye patch was so rude she literally threw my food and when I asked for the corporate phone number she started yelling at me that she didn't have to provide anything the customer service was so unremarkably horrendous there's no way she should be working in any type of environment where she needs to deal with people this was the most worse customer service that I've ever received.. if I could put negative stars I would."}
{"text":"No cool subway, the meat was very old and smelly. I just desired not to eat it. And the guy who made my sub was so tight to put veggies, I literally had to ask him to put more, and he just grabbing one slice and then I ask for more so one more slice.
This subway owner is so cheap.

Just making \"subway\" brand looks bad
Not cool subway"}
{"text":"Just had one of the worst subway experiences of my life. It took the girl 27 minutes to make my 3 subs (which are not by any means complicated orders). I got a side of ranch that isn't even enough to dip a carrot stick in. One if the sandwiches had ripped bread so you can't even eat it as a sandwich. 

Not at all impressed"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly employees, my sandwich is always made correctly, and I'm in and out in a matter of minutes. There's never a wait at this location when I stop by here, which is usually during breakfast or dinner times. A few times a year they run a $3 breakfast special and of course you can never go wrong with those $5 or $6 footlong specials"}
{"text":"Great sandwich makers! (or sub techs?) Sometimes a few minute wait at lunch, but hey, it's lunchtime. Always good, bread is always fresh."}
{"text":"We walked in and a very kind maan was the only one there. Gerett or something. The other employees were out front while he was handling the customers and the phones. The women with red hair came in and yelled at him in front of cutomers all because he put the Buffalo chicken in a large container rather then a small one. And I don't mean a small yell, she barked at him VERY rudely where everyone in the building got quiet and looked around at one another. It didn't just stop there. She complained about it to the rest of the employees that were currently there (still in front of the same customers) and as a customer was telling her what he wanted on his sandwich she snapped at him saying \"you can just list it all at once. I am a pro just so you know.\" I knew I wasn't the only one upset because another customer looked at the man who has been helping us all VERY nicely and said \"if I worked her I wouldn't have let her speak to me that way\" I kindly asked to speak with a manager and she rudely stated she was the manager. She is not fit to me manager let alone be working with the customers. I was very disapointed."}
{"text":"Second time I've eaten at this Subway. The girl behind the counter couldn't even be bothered to greet me and was very skimpy on ingredients. Staff totally rude!! Will never eat at this Subway again."}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches, and their bread, and all the choices. I usually like to get the meatball marinara, on the jalapeño cheese bread. yumm! oh, and then I have them put Parmesan and oregano on it too. and sometimes olives, or banana peppers. so good! and only $5 for a foot long! yay!

At this particular location, I've had pretty good experiences with the employees, and the service is fast and friendly. Always a plus. :D"}
{"text":"Is it just me or has Subway gone downhill lately? My husband and I visited this location last night and it was sub par for sure. With all the new competition in the sandwich business you'd think they would step up their game but I guess not. All the veggies looked like they were from last week, and the employees were less than thrilled about their Friday night shift! But how is this my fault? Also when I got home I was only able to eat half my sandwich because one bite into the second half I found a long hair... my hair was up in a pony tail just sayin'. I'm about to give up on Subway"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for when I am in a hurry and have to take out something near my house.  I usually get the turkey, it is what you can expect from a chain."}

{"text":"We go to this Subway often because of its convenient location to home. There is rarely a large line, even during lunch times. 

Staff is attentive and accurate. Place is always clean and food presentation is professional."}
{"text":"Never a problem with the staff when I come down here. Some may seem nonchalant but they're all really nice people when you talk to them"}
{"text":"Terrible service, not once greeted. There were two lady's working, barley said a word. Lady who rung me up didn't say one word, just tossed my ingredients on my sandwich. Then as I proceed to check out, again no eye contact or any words. I ask if I could add on some chips and at this time another customer came up and at that time she was immediately invested in that customer and didn't even acknowledge me. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I tried the western egg white melt on light wheat English muffin for breakfast this morning. It wasn't bad, Subway is close to my office and I like the green bell peppers and onions that they add with it. Okay for $2.60"}
{"text":"Hard to give a compelling review on a fast food joint, but the server was nice and charged me $5 instead of $5.25 for my footlong. That's my definition of a huge win at Subway. Minimal homeless people, semi-questionable meats and a smell-free environment as much as humanly possible. A definite win :)"}
{"text":"Food is cheap and mediocre, but service is nice sometimes. I like the itailian bmt.5$ can't go wrong but it's still cheap corporate food,"}
{"text":"Dirty location.  The prep area was dirty and the seating was awkward.  The tables in the middle of the room make you feel like you are on an island.  The people line up literally around you while you are eating.  This would not be my choice of subways  to stop at.  Buy a premade sub from Safeway across the street and save the frustration.  Gross"}
{"text":"After going to other Subways in Henderson and Las Vegas, NV, they always provided mil/vet/police/sr discounts but not this location. I bought a 6\" salad bowl that you don't get much in it with the price of $6.76, is pretty sad. The owner is David Bonbara and I was told he won't offer discounts to anyone and that's ashame after few heroes who worked hard deserves this discounted rates. It sounds like the owner doesn't want to give up his comfort in collecting more but only for himself and here we sacrifice our lives for his freedom!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location on numerous occasions after working out at the Natatorium. The first thing that you'll notice is the lack of enthusiasm from the girls that work there. I do not ever expect someone to be jumping up and down in excitement to be at work but they appear to be downright depressed. Today, I was greeted with, \"what do you want?\" Not the standard greeting that most would expect. Hell, I don't even care if you mean it. Just make it appear as if you do. I tell her which sub I want and that I would like the pepper jack cheese. Two seconds later she asks what type of cheese I wanted. Then she asks if I wanted the sub toasted in the same pathetic tone I guess I have become accustomed to.  I say yes and she replies with, \"do you want cheese too?\" I laugh and say yes, pepper jack. The next girl, with the same dejected look on her face, finishes my sub and rings me up. As always, I say, \"have nice day\", even if I don't mean it. As you would guess, on this occasion I received no reply. This Subway is great for the convenience. However, the customer service and quality of bread is not."}
{"text":"Service was great. Rob was very nice and after a customer forgot their sauces Donna without hesitation ran outside to deliver them to her before she drove away. Donna you are my hero! The food was fresh and delicious:)"}
{"text":"Zero Stars is more the case! I could have made my own sandwich as I was the only person in the store and the girl was so RUDE. She let me literally stand there for over 10 minutes while she kept on preparing sandwich's from an online order while I was the only person in the store there she just kept ignoring me. Then she proceeded to tell me I couldn't have a toasted sandwich because she needed to clean it. She started complaining to me about her alleged horrible work conditions and all the work she had to do. I suggested she ask for some more help. She told me the owners of the store won't give her any and started whining about not having had any break or dinner and how she had just transferred from another store for the very same issues. I told her I'm going to call the store owner & report this as it's not rocket science rather sandwich making. I ended up having to leave because the girl was so rude, I left without even getting any sandwich at all. Another customer left also whilst I was waiting because none of us were greeted nor acknowledgment and the girl working clearly did not know nor care how to multi-task duties with any common sense nor handle customers properly. This store needs to get a clue as it's losing customer's business due to lack of staffing and disrespectful customer service."}
{"text":"I was here last weekend on a Saturday and the place had nooooo people so it was just Ariel, the queen of subway, my son and I. She was the nicest sandwich artist I've ever met and whoever runs this place needs to give her a promotion or a raise or a high-five at least! I will stop into this location more frequently as a result of her excellent service."}
{"text":"Brought two of my coworkers here for lunch today and as usual Ian was there to smile and greet us. This is seriously one of the best subways I've been to and the new coupons really make it more affordable to come in more often. The coupon that came in the mail was $5.99 for any footlong and nobody can beat that price with a 20 foot pole!!!! My coworkers got two 6 in meals for $9.99! Cheers to you subway for making the cost more reasonable and Ian for always being kind and professional!"}
{"text":"So here's a funny story.

Well, not \"Ha Ha funny\", but funny.  I came here for lunch yesterday and I had a coupon to buy one six inch with a drink, get a second six inch for free.  

So I order a BMT (long way from Brooklyn I know) and go to pay.  \"That will be $6.61 please.\"  Say what?  \"Oh, the sandwich $4.74 (for a 6\") and the drink is $2.00, along with tax, that's $6.61\"  Ah, huh.

I smile, and wonder why I didn't get two of their \"$2.00 Customer Appreciation Specials\"?  Oh, because with a drink and tax, it would have been $6.61 as well.  LOL  

Well that's one way to get your average customer ticket price up, just fixed the outcome."}
{"text":"After a workout I decided to stop for a sandwich as it was 4 pm and I knew the metro was going to be nuts.

The girl was for sure new which is fine I know their job almost better than them just because I've eaten here a million times!

Asked for Italian cheese and fine herbs (480 calories ) I got Italian (400 calories ) Thank you Jessica.

The bread was very stale that it was ripping apart so that was a no Bueno moment. She almost forgot my bacon until I reminded her. For 6 dollars I couldn't ask for much more so thank you subway you kinda nailed it ?"}
{"text":"Great bunch of guys.  Go visit them.  Only Subway I know of with a drive thru.  Make it easier and go inside."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite on my lunch break because I figured Subway was Subway no matter where you go. It couldn't be further from the truth. The guy making my sandwich messed up two times, I could have went behind the counter and did a better job. He seemed like he was in la-la land somewhere. Aside from this, the tables were not clean (none of them). I won't be going back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Theirs just something about going into a subway during the evening that gives me an unwelcoming vibe. I don't know if it's because you guys are getting ready to close but I didn't even go in super late, trust me I work a customer service job so I know going in late somewhere can suck when it comes to closing. Their was no line, but just the vibe I got from the boy and girl that were helping me was like I was bothering them with my order. I only ordered a salad and two sandwiches, wasn't like I was asking for much."}
{"text":"I don't know why I don't think about Subway more often when I'm trying to think of where to pick up a quick, inexpensive meal. I have lived in the area for about 6 years, and only just recently tried this Subway. My mom told me Subway was running a special on $2 cold cut or meatball subs. I've always liked their meatball subs, so we decided to give it a try. I like that Subway now has a nice variety of breads to choose from. I got the Italian cheese variety. It paired nicely with the meatballs. I do have to say that the meatballs weren't quite as good as I remembered. However, it was still a good, affordable meal. The place was clean and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"If I could rate this subway below a 1 star I would. 

I came to the drive thru. First a young lady asked me how she could help me I stated I wanted a turkey & bacon avocado foot long. She ask me if I wanted a cheese bacon. I told her no and still had to repeat myself two more times before she put someone else on a young man to whom I had to repeat the first part of my order to again. 4 times in and I'm really hoping I get a turkey & bacon avocado footlong. He told me he was going to toast it and come back to me. Nope. The young lady came back on.  After asking her to please tell me the vegetables so I could decide a few times she disappeared and the young man came on.  I asked him for everything except olives, pickles (the worst), banana peppers, and jalapeños. I repeated nothing spicy, no olives, no pickles and asked if he got it he said yes. I asked for a large drink Dr. Pepper. He said okay pull up to the window and I will have your total. I pull up and he asks again what size drink. This is where I should have just left. He charged me gave me my drink and sandwich. I drive home and find pickles and banana peppers in my sandwhich. 

I call to complain. Hi I was just there I specifically said no banana peppers, nothing spicy, and no pickles and my sandwich has banana peppers and pickles. He retorted well you said no olives and no banana peppers. I told him again I said no olives, no pickles, nothing spicy (just in case they didn't understand the next 2), no jalapeños, and no banana peppers. So now you are telling me that I indeed did not want banana peppers that you at least understood that yet my sandwhich still had them. Him:Yeah well I didn't make your sandwhich ma'am. ME: BUT YOU TOOK MY ORDER! Can I speak to the manager to get my sandwhich redone and go pick up a new one or maybe a refund? Him:yeah if you come in the morning, there's nothing I can do for you. 

Seriously I've purchased sandwiches at this subway drive thru and others. Never once have I had an issue. Today these kids either had a shitty intercom and not enough sense to ask me to pull up to the window to take my order or they didn't understand English (which thwy seemed to understand) well enough. Either way neither one of them really gave a damn. 

I am beyond dissatisfied and would recommend this place to anyone. I at the very least expected him to offer to redo my sandwhich, but nope. Now I'm out $12 and still didn't get dinner. Stay away if at ask possible.  There's one with a drive thru on rainbow and Washington. They actually understand the word customer service."}
{"text":"While the employee was nice, he said his manager will NOT accept SUBWAY coupons!  Really?  Asked him if the other location in Moon Twp did and he said yes.  Out the door I went.  Lousy customer service on the manager's part."}
{"text":"Wanted to send some stars out there in the Yelp-sphere for Hector. He was working there this morning (1am) when I stopped in for a sub after my 11 hour shift at work. He was so friendly and helpful!!! I would give him 5 starts alone.

I'm only giving this location 3 stars, however, because I went a few weeks ago around the same time after a long work shift and really just wanted an Italian BMT. I stood at the door ringing the bell and knocking loudly for over 5 minutes alongside another couple trying to get in with no answer. The couple left for the near-by gas station and returned and told me the employee was actually on her break at said gas station. I don't blame her for being on a break, and I understand break laws (10 minutes for every 4 hours, 30 minutes unpaid meal break for every 8 hours...that kind of thing), but there should have at least been a sign saying she was on break. ORR this location should consider having two employees on shift at all times. Not only for break purposes which would allow them to actually be \"Open 24 Hours\" as they advertise, but also for the safety of their employees. Only one person working that late at night? I feel like you're just asking for outside trouble. By the time the couple told me about the employee's break, I was annoyed for having waited that long without knowing what was going on, and I ended up leaving before she returned."}

{"text":"Went in here for lunch with my wife yesterday.  It had been a couple of months since we were in this location.  The staff was completely different from the ones we had grown used to.  Of course I guess that happens when you own a fast food restaurant....turnover is inevitable.  The staff that was in the restaurant wasn't rude but was not pleasant.  They were sufficient.  Welcomed when we came in, thanked us and wished us well when we left, but there was no personality behind it.  It all seemed scripted.  The food was good, fresh bread and ingredients.  One of the few times we ate inside and it was orderly and not dirty everywhere.  We will return here again."}
{"text":"At one end of the counter I was told I can use the coupon I brought, at the other end when going to pay I was told I couldn't.  Lame!!  No more business from me!!!!  Cheeba Hut is much better and a couple buildings to the East!  This location has gone down hill; used to be very busy years ago and hardly has anyone in it now."}
{"text":"Today, while I was about to turn in one of the employees almost ran me off the road and was speeding into the parking lot almost hitting me not once but TWICE with both my babies in the car. Not only did she almost hit us she has been very rude to me while I was ordering my food the past few times I've been there. I always go to that subway and I don't know if she just started. I will not be going to that subway ever again if she is still working there. I hope you guys talk their manager and resolve that situation before she ends up hitting someone else in the parking lot and being rude to every customer. I'm not sure what her name was but she has pink hair."}
{"text":"Food is good, but be prepared because the prices are a lot higher here! The servers were really nice."}
{"text":"Going into this subway I usually have a positive experience. But just tonight I went in and there was an African American man working alone. I came inside around 9:45 PM knowing they close at 10 PM. Didn't think it was a problem because a sandwich is something very simple to make. I know from experience because I myself worked at Jimmy Johns for 2 years. We were supposed to close at 10 PM. But would stay open an EXTRA 10 minutes because we care so much about our customers. Anyway, back to my experience at this location. I stood there for 10 min while the man was cleaning. He saw that I was in there but didn't bother saying a word. He then speaks up and says \"Ma'am we are closed\" I look at my clock and it was 9:50 PM and I tell him that it says that Subway closes at 10 PM. He then says \"we close at 9:50\" I am so angry. The fact that he just kept cleaning and didn't even acknowledge his customer. And how they supposedly close at 9:50 now?! Unbelievable. He needs to go. He obviously doesn't even care about the company. There are people out there who would never pull that crap but probably got turned down because they allow a moron like him to work there."}
{"text":"First of all my experience was awful , horrible customer service, it was nice they offered us a sample of a new sandwich. But the sandwich was spicy so my daughter asked for a cup to get a drink of water and I wasnt paying attention to her because the waitress was making my sandwiches, so then the employee in the back with her son by the way came up very quickly and rude stating she was going to have to charge us for a 20oz drink cause their syrup for the machine was low. Never will I come back to this location ever. You are the worst and very unprofessional with your kid at work with you."}
{"text":"Eat Fresh mo'fo's! Good sammies, fresh ingredients and on the cheap, plus the employees are all nice at this location."}
{"text":"I will start off by letting you know this Subway has the WORST employees, EVER! They are all so miserable and angry, I haven't seen them smile a single time, and I come here about once a week. There is one gentleman who is quite pleasant and I really look forward to seeing him when I go in, but everyone else is really miserableand treat the customers poorly. The only reason I come to this Subway is because of its location, a 2 minute walk from my place but I may just reconsider going the extra mile for better service. 

Oh, and the only reason it gets two stars is for the pleasant service from the one guy working here, YES, he is that pleasant. Otherwise, ZERO stars on this location."}
{"text":"Today's $5 tuna footlong was more delicious than the top 10% of tuna subs I have consumed at any Subway. The restaurant is clean and fully stocked upon entering. The chip rack didn't look anemic and the beverage station was clean as well.

I enjoy the new $5 footlong promotion with breakfast, lunch and dinner sub specials. 

Thanks for making the tuna mix just a tad bit on the creamy side, that really makes a difference."}
{"text":"The sandwich artists are great. They look for better fresh produce to put on my sandwich rather than giving me non ripe tomatoes for instance.

I'm giving this location two stars only because they do not have WiFi. So many locations have WiFi from the airport to McDonald's. Get it together people. I'll change my review the moment I see an active WiFi signal here."}
{"text":"I visit this location a lot inside the food court at the Fashion Show Mall. The sandwich artists understand and remember what I like in my footlong. They enjoy seeing me often and do a good job 99% of the time. They have the $5 footlong, at the time of this review, at this location, even inside of a mall, which is nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches and I love their honey green tea! It's the best solution on a hot summer day, besides a dip in the pool.  The folks here are really friendly. Glad to return again and again"}
{"text":"I have been coming to subway for a while and I eat different types of sandwiches and one of those is the tuna. With the tuna the freshness is a hit or miss. I went into this location and asked the employee is it fresh? He responded \"yes\"  It was my first time asking but my last time eating subway I had a \"fishy old\" taste and I didn't want a repeat of that. I ate most of my sandwich each bite convincing myself that the tuna aftertaste is normal and yes the mayo mix they make it with will make all better , but I was wrong. Halfway through i thought maybe i could put Chipotle sauce to mask the rankness.  best thing is the ice tea I'm gulping down right now to take the aftertaste away. So I ask the employee how many days is this tuna. He said 3 days!!!! Have you ever had tuna after 2 days? It gets fishy fish ranky rankness. I need that made daily tuna in my life! For a company that prides themselves as fresh step your game up subway your better then that!!"}
{"text":"The owner Mary Jo is nice but her store is sub par, doesn't carry all the veggies, always out of the ones she does.  Does not accept the subway card."}

{"text":"I have lunch about 2 or 3 times a week at this Subway.  What I am most impressed with is how clean the store is and that they have low staff turnover.  In the last 2 years I have only seen 4 employees here, and they remember what I like.

When I come into the store they immediately greet me and start making my sandwich.  This is extremely important if I am on the phone and can't take a break to order.

Of all the Subway stores in Las Vegas, this one is my favorite, so 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I usually eat at this subway location after work, but latley the employee working the night shift refuses to make broccoli cheese soup and never has it made. My receipt says his name is Ryan TT , he has very pour customer service, I go out of my way to another subway location on the nights he is working."}
{"text":"So stingy with vegetables! I asked for spinach leaves, which she put a thin layer of, and when I asked for more she put 3 additional leaves on the sandwich! I asked for lettuce to compensate leafy greens and it was the exact same thing! Since my sandwich is only meat, cheese, spinach, and olives typically (no sauce, no other veggies), I kinda expect a little more, especially if I ask. I thought the subways motto used to be as much veggies as you wanted? I'm not being overly greedy, I just want my money's worth! I know they're already making money from me paying $6 for bread, pepperoni, cheese, black olives and about 5 spinach leaves; I really feel like a couple extra leaves could make it onto the sandwich. Not worth it, will NOT come back. Very very upset."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place.
I hate the service and how the place is always messy.
I hate that the teenagers behind the counter can screw up my order when I'm telling them what l want.
I hate that workers are always standing around when there is a long line.
I love that l can help myself to milk.
I love that l can take 2 or 3 vitamin waters without paying. 
I love l can keep going back for more chips and no one notices."}
{"text":"First time at this Subway and first time in years to any Subway. I arrived at 11:35 on a Wednesday and two were in line with no one eating. Hmm. 

I ordered a foot long Steak and Cheese plus a drink for $8.64 with tax. 

They toast it just long enough to melt the cheese but not long enough to really heat the meat. It was a dry sandwich even tho I got chipotle mayo on it. It certainly wasn't my favorite steak and cheese I've had. 

A bit bummed that, due to minimum wage going up, the prices went up. So, for those on minimum wage, (not me) you got a raise but Subway took it back. Not cool. I think they could've marketed that better."}
{"text":"Excellent,friendly service with a delicious, made to order BLT! I wanted to post because of how helpful and friendly the sandwich artist was. This was my first visit to this location. I will return."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean! Service was great!! The girl that helped us was really nice and friendly. Our orders went smoothly and the food tasted great!! We're glad we tried out this location. We'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"My god get some help!!! One person during dinner time! Preposterous!!! 45 minutes for a sandwich. Cmon Jimmy Johns is slaying this place! I love the bread, and the food quality seems to be alright (although I've heard horror stories from my coworkers). Get it together cuz this is a busy location yet it seems to be treated like it's super slow. A few people walked out as I decided to wait on the never ending line. Big disappointment!"}
{"text":"Close to home, pretty fresh, the donuts however are a total tease :( but they're delicious too! 

I will say, they shouldn't advertise for avacados when they really just have some pre-made guacamole'...and an attitude when you ask for it."}
{"text":"Don't come to this location. Although they are good at multi tasking by keeping their  sign on after they are closed with doors unlocked and serving other customers while at the same time provide a low quality of costumer service by saying they are closed while also visible signs pointing to being open."}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone would go here when you can get a $5 Heidi's special right next door...cheaper and more delicious!!  Anyway, staff here was kinda rude, young Hispanic girl was texting behind the counter when I walked in and didn't even look up to help me for a few minutes.  What I really could not stand about this place was how they just slap your sandwich together so quickly and carelessly. I sat down at the table and there was stuff spilling all over the place and it was just ugh. Guess that's just fast food for you, but for some reason I expected better."}
{"text":"It's great during lunch hours when everything's packed. They work real quick, you're normally out in less than 5 minutes.

When it's not lunch time, though... it seems like the employees become really lazy and lethargic. It takes them forever to do anything. They also start putting away the seating hours before closing time to discourage more customers. I mean, there have been occasions when I've walked in about 2 hours before closing and I swear I saw resentment and boredom in their eyes. Oh noes, not another customer. :(

But it is one of the healthiest places to eat and I've always liked Subway, so they get points for that."}
{"text":"After getting home with food, took first bite into a mouthful of long black hair. Totally disgusted, I inspected my sandwich further only to find the entire sub was full of long, black hair throughout. No reply from managers, or subway corporate offices. GO TO JIMMY JOHNS, its right down the same street. Managers much friendlier"}
{"text":"Can't speak for the food yet as I haven't tried it yet but the service was great!! I figured breakfast was over due to it ending at 11am so halfway thru my order they were happy to make me bfast!! Made my day...and the eye-candy making my food didn't hurt either!"}
{"text":"I go to this location often for lunch. Bread is always fresh; tomatoes and cucumbers are crisp and fresh. What more can you ask for in a subway?  The manager is friendly and often gives me and my friends free cookies if he has some extras."}
{"text":"I tend to not go to Subways because I think their bread tastes like cardboard but it's hard to ignore the convenience of having them in so many places. Was driving by this one and decided to give it a shot. I wasn't disappointed. I did have a \"buy one 6 inch get one free with a drink\" and it came to $6. Clean location, quick service and compared to others, what got them 5 stars is that my sandwich artist didn't skimp on the ingredients. Felt like I got extra cheese without asking and they were really kind about asking if I didn't want anything else almost perhaps surprised by the fact I like my sandwiches pretty simple. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I like this sub way it's close to work and the worker are very nice and fast, specially when you are in rush."}
{"text":"I stopped in this afternoon and ASHLEY was working solo and she was SO nice and friendly and made my sandwich extra yummy and when I said EXTRA for toppings, she put EXTRA!
I also questioned if the Veggie patty was Vegan and she checked for me, and unfortunately it isn't. She even offered to use a different knife for me. 
Great customer service Ashley!"}

{"text":"In the tuna was other foods I can't eat here ewwww nasty....
So we walk in and look at the tuna. The crusty ice cream scoop made me want to puke. In the tuna was cheese and bits of olives and meats ewwwww. 
The employee at work all she said was I just placed it in their a moment ago. Really that's sad that she would be so nasty how on earth can anyone put something so nasty inside something that people would eat. I just looked her at then my husband and just said lets go no I wont eat that."}
{"text":"Dirty, workers can be found speaking Spanish to each other while customers are ordering or dining in, very unprofessional. Not very fast service,and they rush you. I'd rather go a few miles down the street to a different one then this one."}
{"text":"Worst service and sandwich I've ever had at a Subway.  Jared wouldn't come here!"}
{"text":"They will give you a \"frequent diner\" card if you are a regular. Good for a free cookie."}
{"text":"Every so often, I do something out of character, going to Walmart's and then stopping here for lunch is a good example. 

Mind you, there is an old Yelp expression I like. It goes like this... \"Every time someone writes a fast food review, an Angel cries. \" LOL. 

But Doctor Associstes' Subway have improved their offerings, and have been hiring Accenture (Arthur Anderson Consults) executives to up their Game.  So far, so good. 

I went with my old favorite, the BMT Italian. The deli meat was sliced larger than I remembered and it seemed to be much better quality than I remember too. 

The bread was outstanding.  It had a fresh taste with bits of cheese melted on top. Underneath there was some oregano and other seasoning that make the sandwich special. I've taken some close-up pictures, which shows the improvements that Subways has made. 

The tab came to slightly less than nine buckaroos. Not bad for Subways and Three and a Half Stars overall. So, A-Okay. 

Now I need to speak to a Weeping Angel about my review. Thankfully, it's not the Doctor Who kind. LOL"}
{"text":"Sandwich was perfect however I gave the guy in the drive through $20 . My change was suppose to be $14 but he gave me $7. It would of been okay if it was an actual mistake but he put $7 , the receipt , and $2 under the receipt when is what caught my attention . The change was $5 short and the guy jetted to the back before I could let him know about the wrong change . We beeped and called the store but no answer and just went around again to the drive through. Crazy part is he knew he shorted us $5 because he didn't even count down his register . A person who believes they gave you the right change would never just free willed give you $5 out of the register so obviously he knew what he was doing . 
If you go here count your change!"}

{"text":"Went into subway today for lunch and the store was empty, but for some reason covered in filth. Tables dirty, floors dirty, etc. Took an employee 2 minutes to even come up front while I stood there and waited for some kind of service. When she finally asked for my sandwich she began with just putting on her gloves and continued to ask me what I wanted. I responded with I want you to wash your hands and she sighed at me as if I were burdening her with properly doing her job. Now I understand it's Halloween, but to have posters of blood and guts from zombies is definitely not an appetizing sight. After my visit I tried calling the store to speak to a manager, and an employee answered the phone with \"hi.\" I didn't even know I was calling a subway, and when I asked for a manager they responded with, he's not in. So I asked if he would be in tomorrow and she responded with I don't know. Overall I was so disgusted and after previously managing in a subway, if this is where subway has gone since I've left I will definitely not be returning. I wouldn't waste my time or money at this subway ever again"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly staff, accepts MWU student 10% discount.  When I went they weren't stingy with the ingredients the only reason it's not 5 star was because I noticed some of the spinach and lettuce were either dried out/old/or browning."}
{"text":"This is one of the locations that doesn't have much seating. The customer service is good. I usually swap out my chips for broccoli cheddar soup"}
{"text":"The assistant manager was nice and friendly. The place was clean. Up to date menu's. The best subway in the area"}
{"text":"Worst location. The last time I went in and asked for soup. They scrapped out the last of it for me and charged me an extra dollar. Plus they don't clean the soda despensers. Nasty location. Don't eat here"}
{"text":"I agree with Bijan's opinion here, I also don't like to review franchises, but in the case of this particular outlet, the staff are just not friendly and the last few times I've been there, they just ask me if I want double cheese/meat or to add bacon and just every other way they can make me order something that would cost me extra. 
I feel like someone who is not familiar with Subway (as some international students that go to UofT or people from areas where there are no Subway locations) can get easily trapped into getting extra cheese, meat and bacon and costing them almost double what they could have paid. 
And the manner of the staff asking this question is not friendly either. 

The seating arrangement like Bigan mentions is far from ideal, especially if it's crowded, the window seating area is very crammped and if you're near the entrance make sure your chairs as close to the table as possible so as not to get hit by every opening of the door. 

It gets 2 stars over 1 because of location (the reason why I frequent it when looking for a quick meal while studying). 

But it's a Subway so you more or less know the quality of food"}
{"text":"I always come here late night. I went in last night right after I had taken a pain killer for my headache and I guess it was too much for me and I passed out while ordering.

***Her name is Dani Jo***"}
{"text":"Subway is great, but this location does NOT accept ANY coupons.  They have a tiny sign (on purpose) stating this down by their cash register so it is not immediately visible or posted on their door. Buyer beware, call first to verify!"}
{"text":"Great Subway location!! The meat, cheese, and veggies tastes fresh! The bread is always on point, never burnt or under baked. They're quick and generous with quantity. If you're nice to them they are nice right back. I loved how they had mini bags of Lays do us a flavor chips. I got to try all the new flavors with my lunch combo! I really like this location, I trust it."}
{"text":"Disgusting treatment of customers. THEY made a mistake and had the audacity to try and insinuate that we are liars and said we wanted our subs toasted. We went back after a few minutes (we realized in the car) to let them know one of the subs should not have been toasted and it was. They then tried to say we went home and were unhappy with the sub so we came back. First of all, that is completely absurd. Second of all, we went in politely and explained what happened. 

The woman behind the counter was so incredibly rude, I have no words to explain how she spoke to us. She then proceeded to throw the complete sub at us and tell us \"we never do this but it was your fault\". I am fuming and I already called head office to complain. I don't care if you make a mistake. We are all human. What I have a problem with is the disrespect and attitude that she unnecessarily projected at us. 

Needless to say, we will NOT be returning to this location again and I made that very clear in my complaint to head office. Staff needs to learn what customer service is because they clearly have NO CLUE."}
{"text":"0 stars. do not eat here. health hazard. employees working sick. that is a food health hazard. employees has pink eye and is at work... you know he told his boss. stay away from here..."}
{"text":"good location.  MAKE MORE CHOC CHIP COOKIES!  this location never has any, but has lots of the kind nobody seems to buy (cranberry, raspberry).  give the people what they want!!  i swear some a-hole comes in and buys the entire tray of choc chip cookies every day."}
{"text":"I love subway, I usually go to one on Cheyenne, but I discovered this one on my way to the grocery store. I'm always annoyed with the lack of products at the other location, so I tried this one out.

The employees were very friendly,chatty and I didn't have to repeat myself. They had all their products fully stocked and they actually had AVACADO!!!! 

I will now always come here!"}
{"text":"Extremely clean and polite employees. Food area clean enough. No wait time also a plus. Better than most subways in this area."}
{"text":"Only got cookies but smelt like something burnt in the oven or they were using oven cleaner. Ventilation would have been nice"}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever!. They are rude and don't listen to you at all.  I too was pissed off before I left.  I will never go to this subway again. I don't recommend this subway at all."}
{"text":"One of the best subways I've been to. I'm a regular customer along with my boyfriend and we never once have received bad service. It's always clean they are always friendly and everything is always in Stock. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"So gross. I don't even know how u can mess up a sandwich? And drive through service is so rude! I don't even crave subway any longer lol"}
{"text":"I gave two stars because you get what you get at most Subways, without the customer service, there was maybe one person there today that seemed to actually cared even a little about doing their job.
3 out of the 4 people on the line barely spoke English (including the owner), they act like your an inconvenience to them, especially like today when I asked for Pepper Jack Cheese and they put something else on there and acted like they were angry when I asked them to put on what I ordered.
The customer service at this location is probably the worst I've experienced at any Subway, and I've been to dozens of them all across the country.
I believe the only reason they have as much business as they do is their location, it's definitely not the smiling faces and interaction with the employees that's for sure."}
{"text":"Yes. 4 stars for a Subway. Why? First of all, it's in close proximity to the Toronto Airport hotels. Secondly, and probably the most important, it's 24 hours. This is huge for late night eaters who don't want to wander all over Toronto to get a meal.

The place itself was really no different than any other Subway I've been to. The service was prompt, friendly and accurate. What more can you ask for in fast food? I was very satisfied. 

The Indian gentleman that crafted my sandwich added a certain ingredient that made the sandwich wonderful and unforgettable--yes my friends--LOVE."}
{"text":"Nice staff and fresh food! I'm only here like every other day!"}
{"text":"I love Subway. This location is attached to a Winchells, has a drive thru and is open 24 hours!! Great healthy alternative to burger joints when you want some late night munchies. 
The inside is very spacious and clean and there is even an outdoor patio. Very nice!!"}
{"text":"Went in with a coupon for any 6\" sub for $3.50. Asked clerk what came on a certain sub and he said, Ham, Roast Beef, Turkey and Bacon. Ordered same. When it rang up he said it would be $4.67 with tax.  Asked what happened to the $3.50 and he said it went up $1.00 when I got the Bacon. Told him he said it came with it and he said the cash register said NO. I told him to let the cash register eat it then.!. Walked out and won't be back. He asked if I wanted to talk to Manager, No already talked to one idiot that was enough. Keep up the good work Subway."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here around 12:30 on a Tuesday. There was roughly 10 customers before us and only two employee's working. The wait was not very long depiste the long line. Miguel took care of us and he was great! The entire time he had a smile on his face, engaging with us the entire time. Our sandwich and salad came out great."}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly and the place was clean and didn't smell funny like some other fast food joints."}
{"text":"Nasty vinegar... not sure if it's like that at other locations.  Service was always good at this location tho."}
{"text":"A brand new subway location that is open 24 hours a day. The interior is very nice with all new fixtures and LED TVs for the menu. I have been here several times now and the staff are very friendly and very prompt. Not too far from the highway and the local residential areas.

The other subways in the area could take notes from this owner they definitely know how to run a good ship. I know the sandwich market is competitive but they are off to a good start and I recommend any subway lover stop by for a visit.

As an added bonus they have a VIP member card but they stamp after every Sandwich. My only request for them is that they continue to take time with each customer and not to rush through every order like the other shops do"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I was a \"sandwich artist\" once.  

I ordered a meatball sub and typically they ask what kind of cheese you would like first so it can save the bread from the sauce so it doesn't get all soggy.  The lady didn't do it in this order AND put the meatballs right at the weakest part of the open bread - right in the middle.  Needless to say, when I got home 5 minutes later, the food was still hot but the sandwich was a sloppy mess.  I lost meatballs left and right and eventually just ate with a fork.

I'm hoping that this isn't another change in procedure at Subway - I was very sad when they got rid of the U-cut, though it is understandably hazardous for all parties involved..  Meh, I still cringe at the memory of soggy bread!"}
{"text":"cuddos to JOSE! what a great example of customer service. He asked questions, acknowledged the customers in line, even apologized when he wasn't to sure on how a coupon needed to be rang up. Jose took pride in the way he treated the costumers as well as assembled our sandwiches! THANK YOU JOSE! It's been to long since Iv'e experienced someone go above and beyond."}
{"text":"A great new location! Subways is a decent alternative to the hamburger guys. At this store, they are fast, friendly and a nice group. 

I was very impressed with the quantity of food on the sandwiches. Clearly they aren't following the cookie cutter guidelines of how many slices go on a particular sandwich which is a nice touch. Sometimes, you have to order double meat depending how thrifty the store is, but not here. 


Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What can be said about a small quick sandwich shop. The service was quick and courteous.  Bread always make the sub and their break was fresh and the ingredients fresh. Prices are about the same at any subway in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Decided to try a breakfast flatbread from Subway for the first time this morning on my way in to work and found a hair from the little old redhead woman who made it after I'd taken a few bites. Disgusting. I walked back and for a refund but will most likely never go there again. She should have been wearing a hairnet. Apparently she was the manager, which I found out when I called to make a complaint."}
{"text":"AlThough we had to wait a while the one employee working did a phenomenal job she was calm and patient and very kind wasn't freaking out and very polite! Adriana is a great employee! Made our sandwichs exactly how we liked and a fast a she could with quite a line information and behind us! We love this location! Subways the best!"}
{"text":"Usually I don't have a problem with this subway other than the fact they never seem to have chicken noodle soup available but today I was running late and thought hey let me make a stop at subway for a quick bite. Getting there, although it clearly says they are open until 10, their doors were locked (at 6 pm), even though their sign was Bright and Lit OPEN."}
{"text":"Great as usual. 
Staff was friendly and quick. 
I like when the store is kept clean - which they were. 

Exactly what you would expect which is good."}
{"text":"Subway is so great.  I try not to eat out too often, but when I don't want to feel guilty about going to Mcdonald's or Chipotle, I usually choose Subway.  This location is within walking distance from my home.  Plus, they always have these deals going on.  For the rest of June, there are three 6\" subs that you can get for $2 each.  How great is that?  Those subs are the Cold Cut Trio, Meatball Marinara and the Veggie.  Yummmmm."}
{"text":"avoid this place at all costs, there are enough other subway resturants to eat at.
the last two times i went here the employees were mean and act like they dont want to help anyone. rude."}
{"text":"As many times as I eat at a Subway restaurant this place isn't that bad. Nothing fantastic. I have never done the drive thru. It is easy to tell that the person making your sandwich doesn't care about what he/she does. So, a quick in and out works great. I never eat in the store. Just get it and leave."}
{"text":"This is the Subway by my house.  I go to lots of different Subways around the valley so I feel like I have a good basis of comparison when I say this one deserves 5 stars.  First of all, it's always SUPER clean.  I love that.  Second, the staff are friendly and responsive, not to mention the fact that there's not a lot of staff turnover.  The staff make good choices - honestly, I've been at other Subways where I'll say \"just a little light mayo\" and they layer it on in a blanket, make a big mess out of it when I ask them to remove some of it, then wrap my sandwich up with their hands a big mayo-y mess so that my sandwich and the papers it's wrapped in are a trainwreck.  That would never happen at this Subway.  Also, the staff will banter with each other AND with customers in a very friendly appropriate way.  Another time, I came in to buy gift cards and there was a bit of a snafu with it.  It was no big deal and the situation was resolved, but none-the-less the owner gave me an extra gift card for a free 6\" for my trouble - so unnecessary but it illustrates what a great Subway location this is."}
{"text":"This location does not carry spinach or brown mustard. Lol seemed odd when he told me since I've never been in a subway that carried different add on items than all other subways."}
{"text":"I just moved to Vegas a few weeks ago but had already had lunch here several times and was intending on eating here a lot more.  I ordered a footlong sub and once I paid I asked for a cup for water and was told that they were out of cups.  So I said, well can I get another cup, they said no, because the other cups were so expensive.

So, I was now left with a substantial lunch with nothing to drink and did not feel that I should be forced into buying a fountain drink.  I asked the manager and he told me that I should have  asked if they had cups before ordering, I said maybe you should have told people (or put a sign up).  I have eaten at Subway hundreds of times and never been denied a cup, so never felt that I should ask ahead of time.  The manager was quite surly with me telling me \"well, it's quite the catch 22 then isn't it\".

I just can't believe how stingy some of these fast food joints have become, they have  now lost a regular customer (and I had brought in three other friends to eat there today), all over arguing over a 2c cup, wonderful, won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Okay. All I wanted was a good sub and I got something else. Something that wasn't good. Something that broke this hungry girls heart. I live in the area and I wanted get a nice tasty sub for dinner. I walked into the place and there's not a single soul. No customers, no employees. Just me standing there like a fool. I stood there for more than 5 minutes, the entire time thinking about leaving. But I really wanted Subway. This guy emerges from the basement and says hi. He washed his hands, good stuff. He's polite and takes my order. He starts putting those toppings on and when he gets to the last one I notice a good amount of fruit flys flying around all up in the topping. I died a little inside. I felt trapped. I wasn't going to eat that but I'm way too shy/lame to say anything. I got a combo. Why is my orange fruitopia carbonated? Why? I also got a bag of those Miss Vickie's Sweet Chilli blue bag of heaven chips. That is all I have. Would've totally been a 1 star but luckily the dude washed his hands. Respect."}
{"text":"They just started serving hazelnut and French vanilla coffee. Very yum. They had the matching creams & zero calorie sugar. Just missing nondairy creamer & stir sticks. Place was crash, staff were friendly. I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"First off I have NEVER been to a Subway with such AMAZING customer service!!

I was in town for just the day (I'm getting ready to move to Henderson shortly) and it was the end of a very long and draining day, my grandma sent us here since she always has coupons to pick up dinner for her. 

At the time their was 2 male employees working the counter and both of them were so nice and accommodating they gave us these stamps cards that no other Subway ever mentioned or gave to us! 

This would make me try Subway again because of their amazing service! I'd definitely be back since it's right by our new house!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches taste like card board. I've eating subway for over 10 years at home and travel. LV Subways don't even follow the national advertising sales. Meat tastes low grade worst."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed. I stopped in later tonight to get some food. When I got there it appeared that some of the employees friends had brought the dogs to the restaurant. Not a problem with me as I am a dog guy. However having a dog laying on the table was such an unappetizing sight as it was cleaning itself and one of the employees was sitting at the table petting the dog. I just walked out. No one there said a word. It was just a weird experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been in here twice and each time it's been a terrible experience. Every time we go, the customer service is extremely rude, seeming as they're in a rush to keep things \"clean\" So they can go home on time, than to actually take time to be polite and make our sandwiches correctly. The first time we went, it was about 9:45 PM. It appeared that they were closing everything up, putting everything away, and ready to go. My boyfriend and I both ordered a foot long. I was sort of indecisive on what I wanted on mine. The manager then sighed and continued talking to her coworker saying she better get out on time, and that there's ten minutes left, rushing me to decide. I then told her my order, and she talked over me to talk to her coworker about her plans for that night. As we rang out, she continued to be very rude with me, didn't say \"thank you!\" Or \"have a good night\", and then followed me and my boyfriend to lock the door behind us.
It was 9:55 PM. 
Today we decided to give it another try. It was about 8:30 PM when we came in. Again very rude and very rushed. They didn't listen to the amount I wanted on my sub, and when I would say to add more, I was given another sigh. Same manager, different coworker. We tried to order soup, and was told that they already threw it out. It was only 8:30? Overall, I am never going back to this subway again, and I recommend no one else should unless you want crappy service and a rushed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decent location, decent service, speed and staff. Thou that depend on when you go, This is one of 4 subway location within walking distance of the college so lunch time will get busy at any of the locations.

Usually there are timely but it depends if they have one or two people working usually they have two but the staff does change periodically. Doesn't really affect service, i dont see much difference between any of chains, they are all fine, nothing special but nothing bad."}
{"text":"- Slowest service ever. The way they made the sandwiches was extremely slow. Even worse was when the sandwiches were wrapped up. There was only 2 people in front with 2 simple subs, and yet it took 15 mins for me to get mine (1/2 people's subs was almost done as I ordered by the way). While they made my sandwich, very slowly, there was 3 more people behind me. The employees had no rush or care that there was a line up due to the fact they were moving slow like they didn't care. 

- The 2 employees were speaking Indian (I believe) to each other as customers asked for specific things - so who knows what they said. They would make comments to each other after customers had special requests or comments about their food. 

- They couldn't even make a sandwich properly. I've had Subway for many years since I was child and every location (in Canada and the US) laid the turkey the same way, folded on an angle on the sub on one side. This place just put 2 big stacks turkey breast (4 pieces of turkey in each stack), just on the sub. That's a lot of turkey to bite into. 

When I asked to fix it to how it's supposed to be, it was fixed then the 1 employee told the other what I asked to change and then they talked about in Indian. 

I find it extremely rude to speak a different language the entire time your customers are speaking to you. 

I highly recommend to AVOID this Subway.  

There's a better Subway on King St W just a few minutes east."}
{"text":"Dirty floor, dirty tables, filled out employment application in open view of anyone.... this location has a management problem"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service I've received since visiting Pittsburgh! Makes a great sandwich too!!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy sandwich shop. I've been here probably 5 times, and it's consistent. Quick service, even if there's a line there's never more than a 5 minute wait. If you're a student flash your student ID and you get a 10% off! Best part about subway is that you can stack as much produce on as you want. I'd recommend the turkey breast sandwich. It usually hits the spot!"}
{"text":"If you want good customer service this is the place to go. Staff is always super friendly and actually enjoy being there. Portions are also great and they do not cheap out and cut back on them. Restaurant is very clean. 10/10 will recommend."}
{"text":"Holly was super sweet. This location is always busy and Holly shouldn't have to work alone. She has a lot of patience and gives good customer service."}
{"text":"I've seen some bad reviews, so I want to share my experience. I've been coming here nearly everyday for the past three months. The service has been very good and friendly. The food is always good and consistent. 

The owner is here a lot too. I see him cleaning and supervising, and you can tell he really cares about this store and the customers. Visit this location, and you will be pleased. It's clean, friendly, and tasty."}
{"text":"Generally a good place to eat until they hired Jhoana. She served me moldy bread and i did not find out until i ate most of the sandwich. When i confronted her about it all she had to say was \"sorry about that\" and made no effort to reconcile. Beware eating at this restaurant when she is there. Jhoana is as brain dead as they come."}
{"text":"So my family and I stopped at this location for a quick lunch. The place was clean and the sandwich was perfectly made.
The wait was quick even for the amount of people in the line. 
The only thing that I am unhappy about is that the cashier charged me incorrectly for more sandwiches than I had. She did ask \"3 sandwiches right\" but before I could answer that I only had 2 sandwiches it was too late and my card was already swiped. She did void the transaction and made me pay again for the corrected order now I have a pending charge lingering on my bank account due to the error made.
Overall this place is a 3 star for me and does have potential for improvement."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in the service that I received here at this location. The location was hidden if anything.
When I walked in, the place was clean as the 2 associates were cleaning up. I had ordered 3 sandwiches but another customer came in and mentioned they were only going to order 1 sandwich so the Subway associate decided to assist the other person before finishing up my order. 
I am never going to this location ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Always busy which is a good sign that they do a good job at this store considering there are 3 others within a 3 mile radius. Store is always clean, staff is attentive and friendly, and fast. I don't have to repeat myself 50 times with what to put on my sandwiches either which is something I do appreciate. 

All in all a nice place to stop by for lunch on the go!"}
{"text":"I keep telling myself I am not going back. But it's close to home and convenient. The owner needs to go in there sometime I doubt he remembers he owns it. They have the least amount of business of any Subway I have seen. Well partly because ever since it opened I have never seen more then 2 people working there. And it's obvious they take the slowest of the slow of all Subway employees. Since they opened up you can take a nap while they do something like cut your bread or put your meat on. If they had faster employees and more of them maybe their business would pick up. It wasn't busy when I was there today. One person ordering 2 sandwiches could have been 22 as long as it took. I walked out. Two people in front of me waiting to order. And at 11:50 this morning the lunch \"rush\" there was only one person working there. Most stores have 3 on duty in the slow periods. So good thing I got a candy bar before I got there at the Dollar Tree across the street because that became lunch. I didn't have time to wait all day for a sandwich. And not to be mean but the people working there how can I say this nicely..... English is not their first language nor their second, generally they have little or no command of the English language. 

So Subway management take note. Shut this one down cut your losses. Unless someone is using it as a tax write off. As slow as business always is they can't possibly make  enough to cover overhead for each day. I used to go there because rarely is there more then one person in front of me. But today by this stores standards they were \"busy\".  For sure this time I am fine. I'll to to 7 St & Bell. Crowded much much busier store but faster employees and more of them. 

Again this store needs to be shuttered it's hurting Subway's brand. Or ask the franchisee to actually visit the store sometime. But he needs someone to drive him there since he probably forgot where he left it."}
{"text":"At least the food doesn't taste as bad as the whatever crap is on the front of the building lol"}
{"text":"This subway has gone down hill I have been coming here for years and I have realized the whole staff is new. What happen to the good workers now there are new employees every week and they don't even know how to make sandwiches and horrible customer service."}
{"text":"The staff at this subway is always friendly!  I am always impressed how nice and professional they are.  Subs are always good and they move faster than your average crew. Well done!"}
{"text":"For goodness sake, look at your yelp comments. You guys are starting to be really bad. When Hector ran  this place it was nice, it had fresh meats and vegetables. Now everything is stale,  the tuna looks two days old every time I go in there and meets look at least 1 to 2 days old and the vegetables are garbage. Do something to improve your quality or you will close. People who come in they are probably just desperate to get something to eat before they run off to work or whatever. I know I was today otherwise it would not have gotten the food I took one look at the vegetables and they were gross. I took one look at the tuna and it had brown stuff all around the top, this is not the first time this has happened. I used to love subway tuna. Yuck!"}
{"text":"The Oakwood subway got better,my god.
On our last visit we have been spoken too and ask what we would like and they looked at us while they spoke to us ,great improvement.
Plus we did not see any employees make out with each other in the corner.
What  difference a little letter makes!
Like every sandwich shop they don't give you allot of meat anymore so you taste allot of bread .
The Store looked clean."}
{"text":"I always have great service at this location. The employees are all really friendly. I usually go in and get my sandwich before work so I don't have to go out on my lunch break to get food. Even the couple times that I've gone there during the lunch rush, the wait is relatively short and the employees are still very friendly even though they're really busy."}
{"text":"There's a super-friendly clerk who works here who is usually the one I bump into. She's friendly and makes a super sandwich. I'm disappointed they run out of things so early, no soup and only wheat bread left at 7:00. The guacamole I got ended up being the last scraping out of the package (mmmmm graying avocado!) If you're going to be out of food after the lunch rush, maybe you shouldn't stay open for dinner?"}
{"text":"Just not sure what the point is of being open 24 hours if you're out of soup, most of your breads, and avocado by 7:15 at night. 24 hours if you're hungry and don't care what you get, I guess. Don't go with kids on a Thursday night and expect to sit outside, because the patio is overrun with a group of kinksters who hit up the coffee place next door and conversations are of an \"adult\" nature..."}
{"text":"I was there about 35minuts ago?4:00am?the lady whoever working right now,she is absolutely rude! I walked in the store and she didn't even look at me and no welcome.I started to order and she stopped me said\"hold on a second\"without looked at me and any explanation.I waited for more than one minute.She was still busy at doing the computer things.so I asked her how long is gonna take,and  she said\"20 minutes\".Can't believe that.So I asked her\"why u don't tell me it's gonna be 20minutes earlier\",She only said\"I can't give u any ting in 20 minutes\"That is the worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"I ordered a extra meat Philly cheese steak what I got was less meat than I've ever seen on any sandwich the bread was over toasted to the point of rock hard. When I called to see if we could get new sandwiches I was told by a very rude young lady I would have to call back Monday-Friday 9-5. There was nothing she could do. Awesome customer service NOT! Perhaps they shouldn't leave their store in the care of people who don't know what they are doing."}
{"text":"This is not the closest Subway to where I live but I've started going here because they consistently are more generous with the toppings than the other two I occasionally go to."}
{"text":"I am a former employee as of this week. I worked here for 6 months, and gave 110% to this company during my time here. On Thursday, January 12, 2017, during my shift, we were visited by the owner, Shane. We were struck by a heavy lunch rush which kept me occupied for about an hour, after which Shane left the store. I went to the back of the store to check my phone. I saw a photo I did not remember taking saved in my gallery. Upon opening the photo for a better view, I recognized the person in the photo as Shane. I showed the photo to my manager and she checked the security footage. On video, we saw Shane not only picking up my phone, but rummaging through not only my purse, but my manager's as well. 

My manager proceeded to call Kabi, the co-owner of our location. He confronted Shane on the matter to which Shane explained my phone had been ringing and he was simply silencing it, which would have been believable had my phone been in service at all. I received no apology from Shane and was instructed by my superiors to \"keep the situation quiet\" and forget it happened.

Never in my 9 years in the working force have I ever felt so violated or hurt. I quit a few days after due to the fact I no longer felt comfortable at my job.

Please reconsider giving your business and hard earned money to this location."}
{"text":"Apparently Dimarco is having a bad day - poor customer service - appeared to be a chore to take the order and assist with the preparation. If you prefer not to provide good service you should move on to a different field of work. 

Next..."}
{"text":"It's a subway.  Crap food at a great price!  Though do not try to go here during lunch.  The line is usually just way too long.  Though atleast the employees always seem to have a smile on their face."}
{"text":"I had the best sandwich today. My mom LOVED hers. Thanks for not being stingy on my toppings. Btw loved the Crab sensation x's two. I won't stop coming here as long as the service is as good as it was tonight. Thanks boys I will see u tomorrow."}
{"text":"The worker Amanda did not greet me when I first walked in. She was to busy carrying a conversation with an other customer about why she was passed over for a promotion. She continued to assist this costumer all the way through while I stood in line. No biggie. She finally gets to me and starts making my order. In the middle of my order another customer walks in and she stops making my order and begins to assists them. I begin to feel outraged. I stood in line and waited. Why are these people being helped before me? I had to be somewhere and she just didn't treat me fairly as the other customers. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was impressed and annoyed at the same time by the size of the line going out the door. I figured either this is a REALLY awesome Subway (hey, it could happen!) or that this is the only Subway in the area close to everyone's workplace. I gave it two stars, so you figure it out.

The service was \"so-so,\" the sandwich was, \"just okay,\" and I didn't like being all up in someone's business waiting in line while they're sitting at a table trying to enjoy their meal."}
{"text":"Just wasted my money, threw my sandwich away. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap, I pulled out all the chicken because it tasted like rubber, I tried to eat it without but just ended up throwing it out."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Subway, clean and reasonably efficient staff. What sets this one apart from about ten other ones I've eaten from Surprise all the way through to this area is that they opted to stock the veggie patties. NONE of the other Subways I've tried have these. Which opens up two new items on their menu - the Veggie Patty sub and the Veggie Max salad. I just posted a pic of the latter. I'm quite a fan of the veggie patties, although they're apparently fairly high in sodium. The veggie max salad is just the right size to take the edge off your hunger at lunch and see you through to a 3pm linner. Not many people know about the veggie patty, often the person behind me will look at my sandwich being made and ask me \"what sort of meat is that?\" *8-)

Since I'm not a vegetarian, one day I might try the veggie patty with a coupla slices of meat like ham maybe. Might taste pretty good, especially with the spicy buffalo sauce. Anyway. Five stars."}
{"text":"Worst subway I've been to! On January 19 I went to get a sub at 8:30 ( they close at 9. I know, I know, kinda rude to come in that close to closing time but I was starving) the sign out front said open, I walked up to the door and it was locked! Really?!? Locked during business hours? I called the next day to complain and was assured that it would never happen again and they would talk to the employee working that night! 

So I went in a few days ago, only because they have a good deal on subs right now. The guy at the counter looked like a homeless junkie. Very dirty, and he had a lengthy beard that was not covered. Eww!  He half ass-ed my sandwich, didn't put the right amount of meat on it, and another associate from the back came up and kept watching him and giving me a weird look. The sandwich tastes like it had old bread and I felt a little sick afterwards. =[ but alas, I went back!

Last night I went back to this location again, and the doors were locked, again. It was 7:45 and they don't close until 9! I am done with this location!"}
{"text":"I've got to say, I've lost all faith in Subway! I've been to several of their locations in the past couple of months and each one is always has the same problems. They're always out of chocolate chip cookies, not a single employee knows how fold a sandwich anymore, and the staff is obviously bothered to have customers in the store because then they have to,like, actually work or something. 
Some advice for subway, retrain your people. Seriously, not one time in the past 10 visits has my sandwich been folded instead of rolled together. Because of that, I either get a bite all meat or a bite of all veggies, and if that's the case, I'd rather go somewhere else. RETRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES!"}
{"text":"The employees here are all very nice.....every time......the area where they make sandwiches always looks orderly and clean......I have never gotten a bad sandwich here....today we got steak and cheese on Italian bread.......awesome......the store always looks clean .....but again, the employees........ALWAYS very nice."}
{"text":"Beware. I ordered a chicken breast sandwich. I was ill for three days. No joke."}
{"text":"A great addition to the Surprise area! The staff is great--polite, friendly, and they get the sandwiches done right the first time. I've used them twice for catering purposes and they were on the money! They even helped me carry my sandwiches out to the car! I gladly drive by 2 other Subways just to go to this store."}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from where I work and therefore is very convenient. Good service, nice sandwich artists and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was a regular here when I lived in Arizona. This is a great store location with an owner who owns several locations in the area. He's very hands on with his staff and entrusts his assistant managers to keep things running."}
{"text":"Of course there seem to be a million and one Subway shops but I wanted to make special mention of the shop near Target, next to Paradise Valley Mall. I went there on Saturday to grab a quick sandwich on the go and they had a special on roast beef sandwiches on Saturdays and it was really good. The meat was cold and tasted fresh, the toppings were fresh and actually had flavor. The bread was very good, honey oat. And the service was surprisingly good. I was greeted as I walked in the door with a hello. I didn't have to wait. They were gracious and smiled at me, friendly, helpful. And when I left, they said goodbye, have a nice day.... I was shocked, I never get treated this well at Subway. My sandwich, I ate in the car, but it was very good."}
{"text":"Subway just isn't my thing even on the best of days.  However, I was in a hurry and decided to get one.  When I was eating my sandwich I realized that my cheese was forgotten.  The sandwich wasn't good.  Such a waste of money, IMO."}
{"text":"First time going to this location last night 02/16/18. Just wanted to see if they had chocolate chip cookie cause my girlfriend was craving them. So I'm standing at the door waiting to get buzzed in cause the sign says open. Dude inside was mopping so I'm watching him mop and waiting for him to finish which I shouldn't have to do but whatever. So he goes to the back and I thought he was gonna let me in. He dumps the mop bucket and gets more cleaning supplies and comes to the door after I've been standing there for 10-15 mins and then tells me he's closed and turned off the open sign. Next time turn off the open sign before you start cleaning you fucking idiot. Or at least tell me that you're closed while you're mopping instead of having me stand there watching you mop."}
{"text":"This subway is horrible!!! If my family wasn't with me I would've walked away after the 4 foot longs were
made. All the 4 foot longs ordered was soooo messy sloppy and skimpy. The supposedly sandwich artist was a young tattooed pierced young girl. She had no customer service, shitty ass attitude, and a don't give a crap miserable \"I hate my job\"look. 
She lost her way to a nice tip, I wanted to drop a penny in her bucket but even at that she wasn't worth it. I asked for my receipt to ensure I did the survey to subway corp and of course a email to the district manager is also gonna happen after this yelp review."}
{"text":"I've never had the greatest experience while visiting this subway but it's close and not terrible. My boyfriend loves the tuna sub but he always asks if it's fresh (prepared that day) and half the time they say no. This is not ok especially when it comes to tuna. I could happily pass and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great location. Seems clean on the inside, but the employees are quite senseless. Half of them look like they just got done smoking a joint or taking a nap.. Careless to make a decent sandwich which, is every time I come in. So I have to say, today was my last visit. My sandwich was a joke and falling apart. I'd rather take the 10 min drive to port of subs"}
{"text":"I love this subway. Im always greeted when i walk through the door, no matter how busy it may be. And my food always tastes great. Their customer service is impeccable."}
{"text":"I do not like this Subway because they get upset if you don't leave a tip. I typically don't leave a tip at a fast food restaurant. I feel tipping should be reserved for full service restaurants, unless I am receiving super exceptional service. To me, a typical Subway visit does not warrant a tip."}
{"text":"Appears to be a legitimate team, and well put together.  I'd recommend bacon, Swiss, spinach, jalapeños, cucumbers, onion, green peppers, oil, vinegar, salt, pepper & oregano, in white bread.  Well done."}

{"text":"Thank you Juan and Alex.  The service at this Subway store is friendly and fast.  I appreciate dining here.  I am a frequent diner here.  I am pleased to say everyone seems comfortable here.  It's easy to stay and chat even if it's past midnight.  I have brought friends and family here after picking them up from the airport with late night flights.  I can count on this stor.  I will be returning again and again as usual.  Thank you, Subway.  Thank you, Juan and Alex."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Subway. Although, they just got veggie patties in (opens up the Veggie Patty sandwich and the Veggie Max salad on the standard menu). This is pretty rare for a Subway, the only other one that I know of with Veggie Patties is the one on the NE corner of 19th Ave and Bell."}
{"text":"Ordered online at this location and was told my order (2 footlong meals and 1 footlong) would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived 17 minutes later, pulled through to the drive through and told her I was picking up an online order. I was told the order was just printed, go park and come inside to wait while they \"pounded out\" my order.  I backed out of the driveway and pulled in to a spot. Waited in the car about 5 minutes checking emails and giving them time to make my sandwich (since I was the only car in the parking lot, I figured that'd be ample time). Went in and was told by Katie they were working on my order right now and I could see 2 of the footlongs were on the counter, bread open with no toppings yet.  What had they been doing for the 5 minutes I was in the car??  Finally, I was told everything was ready and Katie apologized profusely and added a 3rd drink and chip free.  30 minutes after placing my order, it was finally ready. Lucky for me, they had some reality show on TV that kept me occupied.  When I got home, the subs weren't even labeled. Not a huge deal, but when you have 3 footlongs and hungry boys to feed, it gets messy trying to figure out whose sub is whose.

Been to this location several times since it offers online ordering and has a drive thru. Usually there is some sort of mix up on the toppings. After reading other reviews, it appears this is normal.

I would have given 3 stars for customer service alone thanks to Katie trying to make the order right, but the whole point of online ordering is to not have to wait. 

Will head to the Az Ave and Warner location for future orders."}
{"text":"I frequent this location often now that the business is run by someone who is doing a lot to win back customers. The food is fresh, and team members are very friendly. I enjoy going here to order my platters for board meetings and my kids like the meatball subs. :) I'm glad I don't have to drive to a different location when I want Subway. Very satisfied!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Subway location and the staff is super friendly and helpful. 

I am pleased to have such a great Subway on the way to work. 
Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I went here for a late lunch yesterday with my boyfriend and the same two people who've helped us the last couple of times weren't there. It was two girls we hadn't seen before. They helped the people ahead of us and helped us quickly. My only complaint was when it came time to pay. The lady ahead of me was just barely putting her wallet and receipt in her purse when the girl asked me what if I wanted a drink to  go with my sandwich (she'd already rung it in, before I could see the price and whatever). I told her no and she tried to hand me the sandwich over the glass and though I was still not to the register she tried to take my card to pay. I told her I was also paying for my boyfriend's which was still being made. The woman ahead of me finally walked away (not that she was slow or anything, the cashier just couldn't wait to ring anything up) and I paid. I'm glad I hadn't paid yet when she tried to rudely reach over the glass for my card because it was almost $3 over priced. She fixed the price when the other girl told her it was wrong and I paid what was due. 

On a complete sidenote, they started using \"for here\" baskets which are a lot better than having to take the sandwich out of the bag, unroll it, etc. I mean, I know that an extra few seconds isn't much, but it always seemed to make a mess so plus one star for the baskets alone. 

Also on a sidenote, there were three overweight obnoxious a-holes in there at the same time as us. There's limited seating in this place (five tables tops) and including the woman ahead of us, there were only two left, which were in direct sunlight. So, we sat close to them (NOT intentional) and they got quiet. Then, they spotted another employee who'd been in the back or on break and decided to make fun of him with snide little comments saying he looked like a \"grown up Harry Potter\" and"}
{"text":"Great pleasure to meet Mona today! She heard I was heading to a lunch with my young daughter and offered ideas for packaging the sandwich to make it easier. Super sweet and attentive. She's an asset to Subway."}
{"text":"This is a shitty location. The lady made my sandwich is the worst customer service rep I've ever had at a subway. The floors have not been swept in who knows how long. Maybe instead of being on the phone, she should sweet. I'll never come back here. I hate shitty service."}
{"text":"Last year, Subway introduced their FebruANY. Any regular FOOTLONG is $5.00 during February. Get it?

Well we came here two days ago for lunch.  We had a newspaper coupon, and ended up spending just over $10.00 for two meals, drinks and one bag of chips.  Nice!  The restaurant is tucked away in the Gold's Gym strip mall and surprisingly gets good traffic.  

There was about six other patrons there when we arrive.  We were greeted by two employees as we entered. They put our order together pretty quickly without error.  The efficiency at Subway is good to begin with.  We ordered the Veggie Delite and a Roast Beef.  Both were very fresh and tasty, see photos.

An interesting sidebar, the franchise owner had a framed photo of himself and Jared Fogle.  You can read more about his fear of flying: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/business/jared-fogle-subway-guy-on-being-recognized-in-airports.html?_r=0"}

{"text":"2 strips of bacon on a six inch sub for a breakfast sandwich??  Also you need help that talks!  The guy that helped me this am had the personality of a slug!"}
{"text":"This Subway has made it on our lunch rotation at work, and I've had more good experiences than bad.  We come so often they know some of our sandwich selections by heart.  It seems to be consistently busy but they get you through the line fairly efficiently.  My only gripe with the place is the mess of a parking lot.  Spaces are pretty limited and are a challenge to get in and out of especially if someone is turning in from the street at the same time you are trying to leave.  We've resorted to parking at the Mexican joint next door to avoid this."}
{"text":"On Friday I went to this location and ordered the sandwich I always get. The staff was very friendly! But than to my surprise I woke up at 2am with a sever case of food poisoning from the subway! It ended up being so bad I was rushed to the ER, put on an IV and admitted! Please be careful eating here!"}
{"text":"Do they even have a manager on duty at this location? I work at the hospital and been going to this location since 2014 and nothing has changed. Stafd are always playing around, they seem to be always grumpy and when my coworkers are craving for their chocolate cookies, they're always out . There was a guy that was in training to be a manager though, he was the best. And i heard this store is where they train their staff to be a manager.. great"}
{"text":"Normally I don't have something so nice to say about any chain but after today I do. My brother was working on his eagle scout badge on Piestewa Peak. We wanted 3 three foot subs. We called another Subway the night before nearby and they said they were too busy to take the order. So we called this place. They had everything ready for us at 10am sharp with all of the fixings all boxed up. AND the guy walked the stuff out and loaded it up in the truck. This guy was happy..and polite...not appearing to be all of those things at work at 10am was actually pretty neat. I think he might be the owner...but regardless. The food was good and looked like he actually put time and energy into it's presentation. I only had one employee I was interacting with. But give him a promotion or support his business."}

His energy is a joy he's the one with the motorcycle"}
{"text":"First .. you'll have to wipe off your own table. 

And to call this place a \"restaurant\" is kind of a stretch.

Honestly, I would probably never eat at Subway if it weren't for the fact that it is very close to my house and it's my son's favorite place for a quick lunch. The reason I take him there (besides the fact that he likes the simple kid's sandwich he always gets) is that it is cheap. If I get him just the kid's sandwich, I think it's only abt 3 bucks.

So put my issues aside and I have to say I was still surprised today when a fly landed on the bread and made his way up the length of it while I was saying, \"I *can't believe that huge fly* just landed on my bread!\" The employee was removing someone else's sandwich from the oven and she saw the fly. As she walked back over she said, \"Do  you want me to get you another piece of bread?\" Instead of saying what I was thinking which was, \"Did you seriously just ask me that??\" I said, \"Yes!\" 

Come on. That should have been done w no question asked."}
{"text":"The food is consistent with what I expect to get at Subway.  It's kind of okay.  But this unit is so tiny, don't plan to sit and eat here.  It's also not the cleanest.  The people working here give no rips, apparently, either.  They hardly speak.  It's not dreadful, but is pretty far from good."}
{"text":"Subway is always a good lunch. I popped in with the family today and enjoyed a footlong honey oat meatball parmigiana sub. They have a variety of drinks to choose from including fountain (coke products), Dasani, simple lemonade, Gatorade and a few other juices and milk (both chocolate and white). They also have a plethora of chips to choose from. 

Overall clean, good quick eats, will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I came to this location only because it's close to my work. I step in and order a veggie delight. As I told the girl not toasted she set it for the next girl for the toppings & grabs my sub and tosses it in the oven. I yelled, 'NOT TOASTED!' then the girl who knew not to toast my sub grabbed it out of the oven and places it back on the line. I looked at both of them and they just smiled, like seriously?! I was already irritated by then. When I get to the cashier, I did want a drink and chips, so the girl rang me up and starts laughing making a joke about welcoming people into the restaurant. I ignore her and try to pay and get out of there as soon as possible. The cashier tells me, she rang me up as a small, I just shook my head and grabbed my cup and left. Worst subway I ever been to! Never coming back even though the location is convenient."}
{"text":"This location is relatively new and is one of the nicest restaurants I've ever been in for a Subway. I ordered my sandwich and was in and out within three minutes flat. Very friendly people and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is my 7 year old nephew's review:
Subway has the best tuna sandwich for kids. I like wheat bread, Swiss cheese and tuna. I choose chocolate milk to drink. I like Subway. The people are very nice here."}
{"text":"I work a few hundred yards from this location, so I visit it semi-frequently when I forget how bad the service is and how inconsistent the food is.  

Every time I go, regardless of time of day, there is a line to the back of the restaurant (not from popularity, just from slowness on the line).  The bread is generally not as fresh as I have had at other Subways, and as the other reviewers have stated, the staff would rather snipe and talk to each other than help the customers.  You get a *sigh* disaffected vibe from everyone working there at the least, or at the worst you get an openly hostile attitude.  I realize you probably didn't grow up wanting to be a \"sandwich artist\", but it's your job, so put a friggin' smile on your face and pretend to enjoy it like most of us have to do at our places of employment.  If you have other options, pass on this Subway."}
{"text":"Stood in line waiting for the only sandwich maker to finish helping the woman in line ahead of us. This gave me enough time to notice the horrifically disgusting method of curl-wrapping the sandwich around itself and cleaning off the mayo knife on the paper used to wrap the sandwich. It killed my appetite just watching it, and we left to check out somehere else.

I hardly see how a donut case coincides with eating fresh, I guess unless they've been freshly fried...  :-/"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a couple years now and have been pretty happy with it. The last few months however, have changed my opinion. It seems that they almost NEVER have enough staff working lately. I've been given various reasons but the answers still fall short when it comes to people having limited time for lunch/dinner and have to wait an excessive amount of time for what seems to be a lack of desire to pay enough to staff to adequately address business volume. Might have to look for another lunch/dinner spot soon."}

By this point I had lost my appetite, paid anyways because I'm a decent human being and went to jimmy johns, the clearly better choice."}

{"text":"I've had a love/hate relationship with Subway for years - my opinion varies wildly depending on the location, but this is one of the good ones ! 

The breads, meats, cheeses, toppings, etc, are all pretty standard in any Subway - they have the exact same menus - so the people actually making your sandwich and running a particular location make all the difference in the world. The employees here are very friendly, make helpful suggestions, and - this is the important part - they can make the sandwich you ordered exactly as YOU would make it. 

Other locations have been so constantly disappointing that I just stopped going there, but every time I've been here I've received exactly what I wanted. The sandwiches aren't squished or lopsided and thus hard to hold, pick up, or eat - that was always my biggest complaint with other Subways - I'm looking at YOU, Edgewood Town Center !

The place is very, very clean and I've never encountered an employee that didn't smile when I walk in. They are polite to a fault and genuinely welcoming and friendly - it's a very well-run and well-managed location and it's obvious that they take pride in their work and their establishment !"}

Then the other worker came to me and told me if I wanted just the meat heat it up I need to let them know 1st. I did tell them. Then after my meat heat it up the lady that make my sandwich asked again do I need to toasted the bread.

I've never noticed any glaring difference between the service of food or any of the other factors that I take notice of with respects to writing a review. I ordered the five dollar cold cuts with all my favorite toppings and I won't sit down in record time as I was extremely hungry after long days work."}

So this guy is making my order and is asking what I all want on my sandwich I tell him and he misses three things I asked for.. why ask if your not going to listen and retain.

Dirty dining area. 

Stopped in to grab a bite over the holiday weekend and while waiting to order my sandwich, I noticed how dirty the tables were. Not that I was looking for that - I was just looking at where I might sit because there were a few people ahead of me and saw them. 

Well, maybe the people in front of me saw that too because they all took their orders to go. Anyway, had the person preparing my sandwich not cleaned his hands before making my order, I might have just passed however, I only passed on dining in, and took my order to go as well.

As for the sandwich, I opted for an Italian. Staff was really friendly and very generous with the ingredients to the point that the sandwich wouldn't stay closed. I liked that. Just didn't like the dirty, uncleaned dine in tables."}

There was only one CS Associate at that time and we were the only customer. Associate was very professional and well mannered. We bought a 12\" sandwich and my daughter hates vegi. Upon request from my daughter she filled up the sandwich half with vegi and other half without vegi. Not only that she wrote on the paper wrap on the sandwich which half is vegi and which half not.

When I say gross I mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. 

The attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. The don't care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean. What a wreck. 

As some one who eats at Subway 3 times a week I feel entitled to my opinion, avoid this subway."}
{"text":"Gonna keep this one short and simple. Everyone knows how Subway works.

But I LOVE this location because.....

1. It's 24 hours.
2. Service has always been great here. They're not rude and always greet and acknowledge their customers whenever someone walks in the door. Even if they're busy.
3. SOUPS!!!!! THIS LOCATION HAVE SOUP!!!!! I've tried both their chicken noodle and broccoli cheddar soup and they're delicious!!! Perfect for those sick days or cold chilly days. (I've been to at least 2 other Subways around the area and other locations do not have soup. What's up with that yo!?)"}
{"text":"I've been scrolling through the reviews for this place and they're all nothing like what IVE experienced personally at this place.
Or maybe it's just cause I go during graveyard hours. 
The service in terms of customer service is just fine but the speed of every employee working graveyard is just so inadequate.
I'm always there for several minutes even when I'm at the store alone. 
The problem seems to be that their are always new hires due to the amount of people that are continuously quitting from that location. I still go though so I guess I'm part of the problem"}
{"text":"I recently went to this Subway location the past weekend and I had a really great interaction with the staff and my sandwich was made perfectly.  I think I went during a small rush as I had to wait a little longer than usual, but that is understandable.  The only thing that I ever could complain about is the smaller portions of the meats, cheeses, etc. that they put on the sandwiches, makes it feel like I'm not getting what I pay for."}
{"text":"Subway is the best.  However the rude non friendly people that work there need to go. This is the2nd time I have gone for dinner and the same service.  If you do not like people or like to be a little friendly you should not work with the public.  Ugh! I will chose a different subway next time."}
{"text":"Do not give this Subway store any business.  On Sunday night, January 12, 2014 at 8:50 pm, I went to this Subway and was chased out of the store and verbally threatened and nearly assaulted by a worker there who was or maybe was the manager or the owner's son. It was because they did not have a certain kind of bread. He gave a smart ass remark about why they were out and I told him I was taking my business elsewhere. After an exchange of words, the worker chased me outside screaming and threatening to kick my ass all while his father stood in front of the store and did nothing. I called 911 and he continued to chase me, yelling and threatening to assault me. I had to go to the Albertson's across parking lot until the cops showed up. Worst experience ever in my life as a customer anywhere! Do Not Give this place your business!!!!"}
{"text":"Hey, it's Subway... Not really good or bad; it is what it is. This location doesn't seem any different from most I've been in."}
{"text":"Subway is Subway but they seem to think everyone is on a diet nowaday. I feel like the meat is getting less & lesser. I used to get full from eating a 6\" now I need to eat the 12\" plus chips & cookies. There chocolate chip cookies are so yummy. But so pricey now =T sigh 

Note I'm not a fat person =P I been eating almost the same amount of food for a while.

The service is nice. I'm in and out of there. The place seems clean. They don't have every good specials no more. But in the ad mailers you can find coupons for breakfast and there 6\" subs."}
{"text":"It's Subway, there are just okay subs. I noticed the made the bread loafs skinnier, so they can't put as much stuff on anymore."}
{"text":"If I could give this subway a negative star I would. I have been a customer of subway since I was 11 years old. I'm a great tipper and a regular to the local subway where I live. I have NEVER received such terrible service anywhere, Sharon, the \"sandwich artist\" is the most disrespectful person I have ever had the displeasure to have crossed paths with. I asked for steak and cheese with extra marinara. I have ordered this sandwich since I was 11 years old and have never once had a problem. Sharon said to me rudely, and I quote \"I can give you a little bit of marinara but I'm not willing to give up my sauce on meatball day.\" It's one sandwich, I am a paying customer, I am willing to pay extra! The audacity. Needless to say I will be contacting corporate and if you want to build your sandwich and add anything that may displease Sharon and her precious stock of food, than I suggest you head 4 minutes up the road to a respectable subway establishment to Greenway Parkway where food isn't held hostage."}
{"text":"While it's true that there is a Subway on almost every corner This
subway continues to be my favorite location. It's always clean. The service is fast and friendly. They make me feel like I'm family. 
Good job guys. You all rock!"}
{"text":"Glad to have a subway close by now. Friendly staff, they fix my subs just the way I want them. Clean new store. No complaints so far...."}
{"text":"Much improved since my last visit, so kudos to management or natural selection for that. I like the location of this spot, because even though it is small inside most folks get their subs to go. Also if you want some atmosphere to go with your meal you can hightail it to hidden falls park which is just behind vons. The new sub crew that I encountered were very polite, greeted me upon entering the shop. They also kept good detail to the cleanliness of the restaurant which is always nice."}
{"text":"I like this spot when i'm around sunset and running some errands, it's nice to stop in and grab a sandwich. The place is rather tiny but the times i have been there it wasn't crowded. The staff was prompt in their service and the shop was clean. The folks behind the counter were nice and even checked to see how I was enjoying my order and if everything was to my liking. I am quite pleased with this spot and will frequent it more often."}
{"text":"Nice lil subway located extremely close to the office. I seldom stop by here but when I do service is usually on point. Also unlike a few subways that have a no coupon policy this one actually does. Upon my last visit I was able to snag a 6\" for $3. The staff I have encountered so far have been very pleasant and service was quite prompt. Keep up the good work and I will keep stopping by."}
{"text":"This Subway doesnt even deserve to be opened...

1. Never have CONNIE make your sandwich...or SHIRLEY! If you see either of them making sandwiches...walk away & buy your Sub sandwiches at the Subway off 19th & Noethern.

I asked for a subway club and italian bread, 1. my request for the italian bread was ignored, 2. the meat were shredded pieces and not whole slices 3. I asked for extra Jalapenos, ignored. 4. I didnt even ask for mayo and Connie decided to go Mayo happy, I underatand that your not the one whos going to eat then sub but do your job and listen to your customers. If they say one line of chipotle then do one line, dont ignore and squirt mayo on the sub. Lastly the ladies here need to wear hair nets or do something with your hair, noone needs to find your hair in their food. Also learn how to communicate with customers so you dont lose customers. Lastly employees should cover there tattoos, unless you want to look like you just got released out of the state prison. I know, I wont be coming back to this subway! I know the manager Maria wont do anything about customers complaining too..because apparently we dont matter. I have came 3 time to this subway thinking each time they would be diffefwnt or the service would be bettet...but no it hasnt changed. If I were youre supervisor I would have fired you on the spot for how you treat your customers to kicking them out of Subway!  You dont even deserve any stars!"}
{"text":"Where is the manager? The poor children that work there can't keep up with the amount of customers that come in. Every time I come in this subway it is so slow!! Some supervision needs to be in this store."}
{"text":"The staff I just encountered were two young men who clearly don't want to be there. They were efficient in swiftly taking care of me, but inefficient in smiling. The young girl before me was apologizing to them for not be sure of her order and they didn't so much as say \"it's ok\" or smile or anything....just blah...I think the girl felt bad because they were so dang serious and possibly intimidating, but I don't know...just a passive observation. 

Just smile. It's not hard. Really. 

That is all."}
{"text":"They ran out of bread at 3pm. They can't void your online order making the problem even worse. How a subway runs out of bread is beyond me. Worst run fast food establishment I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Very small, cramped Subway restaurant location located close to the intersection of Bloor Street East and Jarvis Street.  Next door to a Starbucks, and across the street from Rogers's corporate headquarters, this location is always busy with the lunch time crowds, especially with construction workers working on the two high rises that are under construction down the street. Service is ok, but due to it's small, narrow size there is no where to sit down and have your meal, resulting in take-out orders only."}
{"text":"Slowest subway ever on earth. People are nice here but i come to subway to grab my sub and rush out but not waut in line for 15 min for you toprepare just 3 subs."}
{"text":"This place is never staffed properly.  Right now, there are 4 cars in the drive thru, 3 customers inside, and only 1 worker.  Staff is nice, but slow.  Only come here when I have to."}
{"text":"I went to this location at prime brunch time. They only had one worker who was openly talking to customers about how much her job sucked and she wanted to walk out. It made people feel uncomfortable and no one felt sorry for her. I got a breakfast sandwich and they had one egg left. The sandwich wasn't good and i waited at least 20 minutes. Overall VERY unsatisfied and will not return."}
{"text":"I stop By when I'm out at Falcon Field since it's across the street. It's a typical Subway, friendly owners, fairly clean facilities, mediocre inexpensive & fast sandwiches. Four Stars."}
{"text":"I went with my daughter to grab quick lunch to take out today. 3 trios and 2 kid meals. Rather simple order considering subway's menu. No kidding, 45 minutes I was still in there. Multiple calls from employee to owner. At some point I started losing patience. She entered my order, I asked her to make sure she did not make any mistakes on the bill considering it took 45 minutes, I was worried. She assured me there weren't any. Obviously bill is wrong wtv. I go to grab drinks and she tell me no. I explain it's trios she says she made a mistake. I ask for a refund and tell her I don't want the food anymore. I explain I can't spend the weekend with her at subway trying to get a sandwich. She call the owner again. She gives me the phone because she can't speak English or French. I explain that hey either keep my money and I grab the food and my drinks or they reimburse me and throw the food in garbage. Never again. This place should be closed for bad representation of the brand."}
{"text":"Do not get lunch here if Aaron is making the sandwiches. He's super slow. The past 3 times I've been here he takes his sweet time laying cheese down and wrapping the meal. I only get a 30 minute lunch, it shouldn't take 15 minutes to make a sandwich when they're not even busy. Don't go here if you're on lunch. He will eat up your time and it's frustrating!"}
{"text":"So this was the first and the last time I will ever go to this subway. After purchasing a footlong feast with spinach bell pepper and onion and mayonnaise on it I got back to my shop and the spinach was black I went back after eating half my sub I noticed the black spinach I went back to get my money back this trip on trying to remake my sandwich after me telling them no they only reimbursed me for half of my foot long this is not a good customer service act me being in customer service not to mention you can hardly understand anything the employees say"}
{"text":"Meh.  Very meh.  While I know this is a Subway, there's no love in this place.

A) no a/c in the spring/summer (which makes me wonder about the meat and the refrigeration

b) The service is odd.  I wanted to buy a pop and give them a 20 and asked me to use debit instead.  You don't have $20 in your till? Shouldn't you at least keep $100 float? And then today, one guy asked what I wanted and maybe no more than 30 seconds, I told him and he was doing something else.  I had to wait for the other guy to serve me.  Like why bother asking me what I want if you're not gonna serve me?

C) cookies tasted stale and were a bit hard.  What happened to the good ole soft Subway cookies?

Verdict: probably one of the lower ranking sub shops I've been to.  This place needs some TLC to get it to a respectable place."}
{"text":"Chris and Tyler at Subway have some of the best verbiage and communication skills I've seen in most young people their age. They exude their personalities and take care of everyone around them. Classy bunch those two. Very happy to go to this location and see them working. Makes my day."}
{"text":"Just met Cam tonight. Subway is SO lucky to have such a magnificent man working for them. He made sure we had everything we needed and offered to warm my veggie patties, and that's not often done. Thanks Cam. So glad to have been helped by him."}
{"text":"Good friendly customer service... This must have been a new guy from the reviews i have been reading. He was very nice and it was also pretty clean"}
{"text":"Good spot to grub before or after class, or when i have a shoot and have to stay late. Spot is clean, employees are pretty on the spot and quick to fulfill your sandwich needs. it's a fairly tiny spot so if you go during the lunch rush it may be pretty crowded."}
{"text":"Never a line and always fresh.  Go here for lunch at least four times a week.  They have the fresh brewed Fuze too."}
{"text":"Slow service the employees were too busy talking and asking each other for their phone numbers then taking care of the one customer that was there took 15 minutes for the guy to make my sandwich wasn't able to eat it cuz my break was over, I will not be back"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the others who have given poor reviews. I live really close by (even went to high school across the street) and after coming to this place just recently, I don't think I'll be coming back. The owner is a cheapskate who treats customers like dirt. I don't even expect a smile most of the time but common manners? Nah don't bother. I guess they are still open because Mr. Sub across the street is trash so the high school students go to this Subway. I was given 7 meatballs for my marinara sub (you're supposed to get 8). When I pointed this out the owner just shrugged his shoulders while one of the other employees told me 7 was the correct number. I've eaten at subway numerous times at different locations. I think I know that you're supposed to get 8 meatballs in a foot long so I would've appreciated the employee not bullshitting me. Moreover, usually I like to pack my sub full of veggies. This owner told me he would charge me extra if I asked for more lettuce (seriously??). Needless to say, I was kinda pissed off by the time I had to pay. No compensation for the missing meatball. Maybe extra cheese? No. Bacon? No. No discount. Nothing. No apology. Business 101: if you're going to open a business, never try to pull the wool over your customers eyes. Now I remember why I avoided this place like the plague in high school."}
{"text":"NO MEAL DEAL?!?!?  $7.50 for a 6\" sub?  NO REFILLS?  what is going on here?  this is the subway from the twilight zone.  This subway is located in the Southwest Airlines terminal and is the worst subway in the world.  the food itself is okay, but you wait FOREVER.  talk about inefficiencies!  

(1) there is a separate queue for pilots and flight attendants, but their orders get mixed into the queue of regular customers.  this caused major backups and even instances where the sandwich maker mixed up pilot sandwiches with regular customers!
(2) we waited FOREVER.  i think 30 minutes? and we were only 8 deep when we joined the line
(3) there is no number three...just turn around and go to the sbarro's!  at least you get a whole slice of pizza and a drink for $7.50!"}
{"text":"The second Subway located near the Bloor and Jarvis Street locations (the other being the location at 235 Bloor Street East) this particular location is rather spacious, has a small dining area, and is usually busy during weekdays when employees from Rogers, TD Canada Trust, and other notable employers located on this stretch of Bloor Street East are out on their lunch breaks. Open seven days a week, great customer service and being close to
TTC's Sherbourne Station stop in the Bloor-Danforth line are extra pluses."}
{"text":"Second time we've gone to subway and they didn't have meatballs..... we usually go around 10-12 at night because we work nights. This time they're also out of spinach! What's the point of being 24 hours if you don't have all the items available 24hours? Sucks because we've been going to this subway forever and just in the last few months it has being going down hill....... at least the kid behind the counter was nice."}
{"text":"Very small store and not many tables. Perfect place to order and take out.
Ordered Flat bread multi-grain with chicken, guacamole, provolone cheese topped with tomatoes and pepper. Every Subway chain is run the same way. Reminds me of an assembly line. Walk in give the order, you tell them what you want for topping, pay and then go. 

This whole area is hopping M-F and relatively dead on the weekends. So reminds me of the Wall Street area in NYC."}
{"text":"Walked in for a sandwich after a rough day, Thomas cheered me up with his outstanding service and a delicious sub! Not only did he make me feel right at home, he told me he has only been working there three weeks! You could tell he had cleaned all day when I came in, not a crumb on the floor. Whatever they are paying him, it's not nearly enough! If I'm ever in the area again, I know where I'm headed for a good meal... 5 stars"}
{"text":"Not a bad deal when you're short on time and cash. If you get a specific 6' sub combo with chips and a drink, it's on special for $6.00. Not bad. I haven't had subway in a long time so it was nice to have their meatball sub. Not bad food for the price.

The restaurant was flea and the staff was nice. There is a winchell's donut sharing with subway, so when you come out of he restaurant, you have a unique donut and sub smell!"}
{"text":"It's Subway so there aren't a lot of gold stars to be handed out for microwaving pre-cooked meat that's been sitting around all day.  Subway is usually consistent, but this one doesn't have the currently advertised oven crisp chicken nor do they have the veggie burger type patties.  They seem to be a little skimpy with the food too.  I only stop here because it's on the way home.  Much prefer Jersey Mike's though."}
{"text":"Slowest Subway service ever! This place would never be able to stay in business where I'm from. Workers are friendly but so sloooooow. 8 people in front of me at 12:30 and it's taken 25 min and I'm still not able to order.  But I do have time to write a review - probably have enough time to come back and edit this a few times before I actually get to order. Only reason I stayed is because the A/C is so nice. 
Update - I see that the sandwiches that were toasted have been sitting so long it's gotta be cold and hard.  Really inefficient. But the help is friendly

Update 2 - we had so much time some of our group changed their minds and left. I changed my rating lower as I still haven't ordered. One star.  Sad operation!"}
{"text":"I have tried to eat at this location twice now and both times I went they were out of white bread!! Really?? You're a sub shop, how can you be out of bread not once, but TWICE!! Pathetic. Will never try eating here again. Get your act together."}
{"text":"The slowest subway I have ever visited. Took 25 minutes to get one kid's sandwich. If there was a 0 star option I would use it. Staff oblivious to customers, chatting with each other and generally being inefficient. Store needs better staffing to accommodate lunch hours."}
{"text":"Weird that I have to be the first dissenting review.  I thought the service here was HORRIBLE.  They were aloof, not very helpful and certainly not customer service oriented.

We go to Subway often as sandwiches happen to be my three children's favorite food.

The two younger ones ALWAYS order a kids pack.  They usually get a choice of chips or 2 cookies with their meal.  This location would only give one cookie.  Even after I explained that is not usually the case or that the price would not make sense they refused.  Whatever!  I know where we will not be stopping regularly."}
{"text":"This is a 24 hour drive they subway down the street from my house that I visit often. The guys who work here are extremely polite and patient. I've never ordered something \"they were out of\" or couldn't accommodate. Also, the drive thru line is never busy and your subs come out quickly!"}
{"text":"Really great Subway. We went in today and we were helped by a young man I think his name was Kory. He greeted us as soon as we we walked in and I ordered the 2.00 Cold Cut Combo , he was very fast and asked me as he went down the line what I wanted. He even told my husband if he wanted a foot long they were on special for 4.00 and he made the sandwich just they way my husband wanted, all while greeting every customer as they walked in the door. I will definately go back again , it was very clean and they even had all the fresh baked cookies"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall location where the employees aren't always the friendliest. This subway does have a drive through that's open till midnight, however each time I've ordered multiple sandwiches through it, they've always gotten them wrong."}
{"text":"This place is dirty & I found a long hair in my sandwich.

....

Needless to say, it took me awhile to eat Subway again.
I haven't had any issues with the Subway in the mall or the Subway on Staley & Springfield."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here.  The staff is pretty young and they handle themselves well even when it's busy.  They're always hospitable and make the visit pleasant...add that to good sandwiches and this location is a winner!  Nice job."}
{"text":"It took 22 minutes to get my order of 2 pizzas and 2 sandwiches yesterday Friday June9th ~2pm. The girls working were polite but seems to be their first day. After all this time i learned there was a 3rd worker sitting in the back while there were 6 customers in line. This same issue happens about every time i go there which is getting less frequent with each visit. Too bad because i like subway food"}
{"text":"I'll just say up front, my first job was Subway. Now, this was back in 2005, but I remember most of what the job entailed over 10years ago. I would think things are either the same, or have improved since then.

I eat Subway ALL THE TIME. However, I have never been to this location. I had some time to kill before picking my daughter up from daycare, so I stopped in to grab a BLT. As I stepped through the door, a disgusting smell slapped me in the face. It was like a combo of cleaning supplies and that infamous \"subway smell\". I should have left right then. I proceeded to the counter, and a little 5ft woman begrudgingly said hello. I told her what I wanted, and away we went down the line adding bacon/cheese/veggies/sauce. She literally put 3 pieces of everything. Now, I remember that they have a way of making the sandwiches (x amount of meat/cheese for a 6in or 12in), but I got 3 pieces of spinach, 3 olives, 3 banana peppers, 3 green peppers, 3 onions, and 3 SHAKES OF SALT/PEPPER.  She had the 3s down pat. She rang me up and started to bag it saying \"To Go, right?\" I said \"no, I'll eat it here thanks\" She almost seemed annoyed that I was sticking around (I was the only one there). 

While I was eating, another customer came in to order. She apparently wasn't moving fast enough for him, and he through his hands up saying \"effin forget it\" and walked out. She proceeded to laugh about it with her co-worker. 

All in all; this location had trash on the floor, I had to clean my table off before sitting down, the drink area had straw wrappers and lids thrown about. I'm not even going to go into detail about how dirty the area around the food was. And I definitely didn't dare venture into the bathroom. My sandwich tasted good, and the bread had just been made but customers beware. For as slow as they were, that place should have been immaculate!"}

The meat was nonexistent and the toppings were bare, even when I asked to add more."}
{"text":"25 minutes and still waiting to order Sat. Nov. 22nd

If you like waiting in line this is the place. I feel sorry for the two individuals working.  Perhaps the owner needs to come in and help out"}
{"text":"Very small Subway restaurant location located close to the intersection of Church and Wellesley Streets. Next door to Ginger restaurant, this location attracts customers mainly during evenings and weekends. Good customer service adds to the rating, but limited seating space does take away points."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to write a one star review but this location has earned it. I thought it would be great having another convenient Subway nearby but I will not return. 

The employees are nice enough but this place is so skimpy with the ingredients that they even hold back on the lettuce. My \"footlong\" sub had four slices of roast beef on it - four! The sliced cheese bins were nasty with all of the other food that had fallen in them. The employees may or not not change gloves but they definitely do not wash hands in between which is required.

There are too many better options to get a good sub with better and more ingredients. The Harris Teeter down the road makes a sub that is 100x better. It will be a while before I return to any Subway because of my experience at this one."}
{"text":"Out of American cheese, that's un-American. Employee had to be told to put lettuce and tomato on a BLT. Brilliant. 

Items on sandwiches were distributed haphazardly, no two bites will be the same. Maybe that's a good thing (not for me). 

Unfriendly, teenage indifference. 

I like Subway but probably won't be back to this store."}
{"text":"Food is usually good but the old man that runs the store is quite rude if you look young. Also service is pretty slow and they get flusters when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Horrible parking, limited menu items, an NO $5 FOOTLONGS!! Not even a sign to warn you. My footlong veggie delite and a drink was $13. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"By far the best subway I've ever visited. I go to the gym right next door and I always come around 1am. They always treat the customers right. Workers are very friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today and noticed the lit up sign on the window that said this location was open 24 hours! Neato, right?

Anyway... I had awesome customer service and since the gentlemen taking my sandwich order had a shirt that said \"meltastic\"... I thought I would try one of their new melty subs. It seems as if they always have something new going on --- I like that. The sandwich was good, but was kinda irritated that the chicken was super cold even though I ordered the sandwich toasted.

The store was clean and employees were decent enough. I'll come back to this one, especially if it's at 3:00 AM."}
{"text":"$5 for a footlong is a darn good deal. Just note that the subs are much, much thinner than in the pictures, so I would suggest asking for double the meat, cheese, or whatever you want. 

The toasted subs are my fave. (I'm not too fond of cold sandwiches.) 

I like that they make it front of you. Half of the sub will fill you up, so the $5 foot long is actually good for two meals. The food isn't fabulous, but if you are budget conscious, you can get your money's worth here.

I don't have a favorite, but my boyfriend loves the Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki sub.

I've been here about 3 times and the customer service has been good every time."}
{"text":"Customer service was sub par. Employees seemed bored and miserable. Very skimpy on the meat. Appears that they don't put the regular amount of meat like other subways. Also very skimpy on the cheese. 

Asked for soup on two separate occasions and the first time they had not placed the order. The second time I was told they didn't have any made. 

The veggies appear to be not fresh. Yellow tomatoes. Wilted spinach. Mushy pickles. 

Probably won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Entered business at 11:40pm 07/22/16. Customer service was awful. Either a friend or off duty employee was extremely obnoxious and distracting the other employees. 

The employee that made my sandwich was so distracted that he had to keep asking me to repeat myself. 

While paying he forgot my change and my cookie. Started walking away and trying to convince another employee to lie and help the \"last customer of the night\" when the window clearly illuminates 24 HOURS!

Not the brightest crayon in the box...

Overall it was loud and unsettling, especially since they were ignoring the customers. Won't return to this subway late anymore."}
{"text":"I give this location 5 stars for their superior customer service!  The food quality is great as well.  What a nice visit - the Tuscan chicken sanwich is awesome!"}
{"text":"What is it with this neighborhood?  Subway isn't fancy, it's not supposed to be.  So I guess I should expect nothing but to be disappointed.  I got my hopes up and was let down again... and it's not just this place aside from a couple sit down places nearby, most places over here are just disappointing.

I wanted some pretty basic stuff on my sandwich but what I got were remnants from the bottom of the containers... tomatoes you can see through because they are so old, bell peppers I didn't ask for, way too many onions, barely any pickles and olives (even though I asked for a lot), and only enough spinach to see it when the sandwich is closed but when I opened it to remove the peppers half the sandwich didn't have any.  I also asked for banana peppers and none of those too.  And there is a vinaigrette I asked for that didn't make it on here either.

Sure it may be trivial, but hell... even a half-assed effort would have produced a better result.  Is it this neighborhood?  Is it the employees?  I mean if you have dreams of bigger and better why not show that work ethic and do your job the best you can while you are planning your next big move?  No initiative now only shows you aren't ready for anything more than what you have."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The location is great and i love that if you want you can sit outside to eat and enjoy your meal. The cashier was very nice and helped me with my order with no problem."}
{"text":"I ate hear yesterday because I didn't have time to pack my lunch....today I have a coupon to use and I like getting a tuna sandwich on Friday. Well...I'm pretty sure they haven't swept the floor, mopped it or cleaned the bathrooms in 2 days....same toilet paper that was on the floor yesterday is on the floor today. At least today they have paper towel.  I never see a manager checking in on this place anymore....nor do I see the one gal who is ways keeping the place ship-shape....Staff is friendly but place needs to be cleaner!"}
{"text":"It's a Subway in an airport. Pretty much what you would expect, inflated prices and long lines. Let's not over-think this!

I've never had a bad sandwich here (although I have only had the veggie) and it's nice knowing there is a guaranteed vegetarian option whenever I fly Southwest out of LAS. The problem is that the restaurant is too small, which leads to very long lines at all times of the day. You need to plan on at least 10-15 minutes to get a sub here, so don't push your luck if you are pressed for time between flights.

It's an airport restaurant and the prices reflect this. $11 for a footlong veggie sub is a little absurd, but then again so is $4 for a bottle of water at Hudson News.

The food here is standard Subway quality and considering the employees have to deal with a lot of cranky travelers every day, the service is acceptable. If you have the time and need something that isn't fried or pre-packaged while traveling, this Subway will satisfy your needs."}
{"text":"This is my regular lunch spot. I've been going here for the last few years. The employees are always great. They all recognize their regular customers and are very friendly. I encourage everyone to get to know the people serving you behind the counter. Please stop in and visit my friends when you want to grab a quick bite. 
Seasons Greeting and happy holidays to \"My Subway\"
Thanks"}
{"text":"Unlike the previous reviewer, I have had nothing but good experiences here. This location is in a strip mall on 32nd and gets screamingly busy at lunch hour. The staff work very quickly and methodically - there is a time and a place for witty banter but when the place is lined up out the door it seems that everyone ( myself included) appreciate a  \"Git er done\" attitude... - make the sandwich and keep moving. Thats what these girls do, and at lunch I appreciate it. 
The interior of the place is not huge and seating is at a premium, parking can be too - depending on when you go. 
Ingredients are fresh an service is pleasant and efficient. 
I give this Subway a 5, because as far as Subway's go this one delivers on service, food quality and cleanliness. 
Jared would be proud."}
{"text":"Bon sous-marins comme d'habitude. Mais cette fois-ci, trop peu garni. :( en plus les employés dans cette chaîne sont exploités au maximum! Le garçons qui m'a servi semblait épuisé et battu. Ne comprenant rien de ce que je lui demandais et m'offrait un sourire au regard l'ours de fatigue.

Je met trois étoiles parce que c'est Subway et que c'était d'une salubrité normale."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Subway or it's $5 footlongs.  Now imagine the worst shopping mall subway with the slowest service ever with one person in front of you.  Whoa! Don't forget to mention the other team member hovered over the register waiting for you to pay for your food. Only so he can clock out for his break or time out for the day and eat his cold slice of Villa Pizza.  Yes, Yelpers it was that kinda day at subway. Did i forget to tell you that the Sandwich Artist kept putting her dirty elbows all over the sandwich board while making the food.  It was almost as if she was so exhausted to be making two sandwiches.  I am sure it will be at least two years now before I try this concept again."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's really hard for restaurants to find good employees.  I have found that MOST of the time, as long as a restaurant has a responsible, most likely older manager on staff for all shifts, even the youngest employees will work to the best of their ability - sometimes even surprising themselves.  So when I first visited this store and saw the cashier texting on his cell phone (he claimed he was texting his manager), instead of preparing my transaction, it made me very frustrated!

I would go back to this store if my guests wanted to have subway subs, however ONLY because they are the nearest location within a ten mile radius or so.  Chances are the help will have been fired or quit and then rehired the next time I go.  This is the nature of the restaurant business."}
{"text":"I so want this location to be great but every time I'm here I'm so disappointed. 

I've been coming here for almost 2yrs only because they are close to my house and I only stop here if it's a last minute thought. When I first started coming to this location the first thing they ask, are you paying with cash or card?? If you're paying with cash you had to have exact change bc they didn't have enough cash on hand to give you change back. That happened at least 3 or 4 times, once one of the employees gave me change back out of her own pocket. Of course I questioned and the reason was the manager didn't go to the bank Friday so they don't have a full drawer (WHHHHAT). They never have enough bread or cookies I always have to opt for something different than what I want. Again this is a last minute location, if I know I want subway before coming home I stop at a different location. I gave this location two stars bc most of the employees are so nice and apologetic for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"The staff at this location were to busy talking to themselves rather than listening to the customers order. Also there was three of them in a line making one sandwich, I think two would have been fine, the other could have cleaned or could have been prepping something. They were also out of avocado. They did not have change for a $100 and I didn't buy my sandwich because I went to Burger King for change."}
{"text":"Best subway in charlotte.  The owner is always here and always says hello.   Cant beat the hospitality."}
{"text":"Walked in to get a meatball sub and saw there was only one person behind the counter make 4 sandwiches. I asked if they had meatball he says yes so I wait. 10 min. Go by and I go to order. \"Oh sorry sir we have no meatball\" this place does not even know what they have. Not recommended!!"}
{"text":"Do you ever feel like a meatball sandwich only to walk in and be told \"We have no meatball\"!!! Well if you want a meatball sub that is not the place. Thanks Capriott's for feeling my craving!"}
{"text":"Have you ever \"called\" this location...??? I thought I had called an adult training school.... I really dont think they should let them answer the phone at all.... ugh....no good"}
{"text":"Another one of those places I go to just because I need to grab a quick eat. Although it's just your  typical subway, the service here is better than what I'm used to at Subways where they just grunt at you about which condiments you would like."}
{"text":"Quick, clean and delish. What else could you want for lunch. I don't eat bread, I'm a salad guy. I love the chopped salads at Subway, today I had the roast chicken. I asked for extra olives, no problem. Extra southwest chipotle dressing, no problem. Full tummy. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Nice staff... but I kid you not this location runs out of everything. From napkins, to mayonnaise, to even cups for their soda fountain. I've experienced to many times to go back to this location again.

I'll be honest I'm not a big fan of Subway, but I didn't want to drive far. I went in and bought a cold cut sandwich. I swear I have been sick with food poisoning since 5:00pm..."}
{"text":"I'm admittedly not a big lover of subway in general and this place re-affirmed it.  The produce seemed soft and a day old and the meat products looked very processed.  2 stars instead of 1 because at least the staff was friendly and tried to help."}
{"text":"The fuking manager was rule bad service, fighting n yelling in front of customer, buying a large drink n come back for a refill n the manager (filipino) old rule women ask if i have my receive if not then i cant get refill, and said i stole there soda, do not come to this store if you dont want to get bad service, zero star if yelp have it...."}
{"text":"Subway should take away this location's license, because those who keep kosher should not think this is an accurate representation of Subway subs. I had expected this food would look and taste the same as a normal Subway, just without without dairy cheese. Nope.  Not even close. I had the misfortune to try two varieties: turkey and veggie, and it's a tie as to which was the worst. The bread on both was hard and the fillings on both were less than sparse. The turkey had two small thin slices of meat on a six inch sub. The veggie sub was also extremely sparse with barely any lettuce, a few olives, two paper-thin slices of pickle and tomato and some onions. The only thing plentiful was the rock hard bread.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Need some training to staff members that how to make sandwich hut before Tun they need to keep the fresh bread ! I wouldn't recommend to that subway to anyone !"}
{"text":"This is the nicest subway I have seen in Las Vegas.
Staff is very nice and the was not that busy. The place had nice tv and is really modern looking inside.
I have never seen one nearly as nice. They have a vip card as well so make sure to get one.

I can t remember any other subways offering that
VIP card, just a nice place for a healthy alternative to the regular fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"The worst customer service at this location maybe they're racist and that's why they're so freaking rude I really get a sense that the young female That works there is racist if I could give this place a zero I would I would tell anybody to stay away from this place especially if you're not a white person unless you want to feel some hate"}
{"text":"Dear male employee with the man bun and beard:

I'm not sure why you put minimal spinach (if I asked for it, obviously I like it) and why are you counting the pickles? 

Also, why didn't you sign out of the other employee's register log on? Had you logged in as yourself, I could have put your name in this review. 

The employee's log on that you used is actually THE BEST sandwich maker there, hands down. He's QUICK, courteous, and efficient. 

I said, \"Thank you, have a nice day.\" And you looked at me, put your head down and continued what you were doing. I didn't mumble. So obviously you heard me but didn't have the decency to at least say thanks. Interesting..."}
{"text":"This is the worst subway I have ever been to. I was overcharged for my sub by three dollars and after a couple minutes of half hearted arguing I gave in and paid what they were asking because I was too tired to care. On top of that the sub was made incorrectly and the staff barely spoke English which made it incredibly hard to understand what they were asking or saying. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"As a Vietnam combat veteran I went into this Subway for my free 6\" sandwich on Veterans Day and ended up getting a ration of shi*. I showed them my VA photo ID and they told me I could not get a free sandwich. They said it was a 2 for 1 deal and I had to pay for one. I told them that is not what Subways corporate office said. I have used this Subway for several years but no more. I will definitely  tell all my former brothers in arms about this place. I did get a sandwich at the Subway on Arizona Ave just north of the Target store without a big blast of grief This is where I will eat from now on."}
{"text":"This is now my new Subway store of choice. I had been using the Subway at 2095 N. Alma School for years but when I went there yesterday for my free 6\" Veteran's Day sandwich I was refused. I have spread the word to a lot of veterans in my neighborhood that were really indignant about the Alma School store doing that."}
{"text":"Horrible service guy working there is a total arrogant a S S!!! Also price is jacked high a chopped salad 10.50!!! And I wouldn't even care if they were not so stingy! My salad is lettuce and 5 onion pieces and 10 olives!! Ask for more and instead I get attitude I eat subway every day 3 times a day I love it but this location is shameful to subway awkward how a beautiful place like this area is like that when I go to ne it's amazing lol smh"}
{"text":"A special thanks to the owner Chris and his crew for putting together a wonderful spread for my Mom's Celebration of Life Memorial Service on Saturday, May 12, 2018 at Leisure World. With around 100 attendees, we had plenty of food. Combining sandwiches and wraps was the perfect mix. The overage fed some needy the next day. The presentation and freshness was impeccable. Most importantly Chris took the time to sit with me, my wife, and my Dad as we worked through the details. Subway should be proud to have Chris as an owner as I know Chris is proud of his staff."}
{"text":"Big fat Latino employee dude with glasses that usually works in the evening here is rude ass hell. He doesn't greet his customers, doesn't seem friendly, seems lazy and doesn't seem like he wants to help his customers. I stop my order half way and walked out, I will never return back here because of this employee!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just ok, dirty dining area, just so so sub, no bottled coke in stock. I am not a fan of this Subway. Only good part of my visit they take Apple Pay."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill really bad. I used to come in occasionally and get a decent sandwich with good service. Now it's full of disrespectful employees that make sandwiches (sloppily might I add) on there own time. This is the 3rd time I've been to this location in a few months and had to wait 20+ minutes in line. The second time I came in nobody was here at all to help in the middle of the day, and this last time was my final straw when the employee was congregating with some friends outside, told me I had to wait for her break to be over and she was the only employee on duty.."}
{"text":"My wife and i really enjoyed our lunch here today.  We have never had our six inch sandwiches made with two whole pieces of cheese.  Not only that, the server listened and made the sandwich the way we wanted.  The store was relatively clean and the area was customer friendly.  Although the store is out of our way, we will be back"}
{"text":"Absolute WORST customer service I have EVER experienced! The girl working this morning should NOT have a customer service job if she absolutely hates what she does for a living. I literally walked out before she could continue and I refuse to ever go to this location ever again. Really enjoy subway but she put a bad taste in my mouth over the company as a whole"}
{"text":"Best subway I've been to in a while. Everything tasted fresh and the service was awesome. Ryan talked the whole time and was still speedy quick."}
{"text":"One of the friendlier Subways I have tried. You know how sometimes these places are only focussed on their task? These ladies (I didn't see any men) were able and willing to multitask, look up and say hi while they completed the orders placed. 

Nothing different about the food, which is probably a god thing. If you go to a chain, you are looking for consistency, not hoping for something different, this location did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Like most Subways, quality depends on the management. This location is ok, not much different from the average store. I always order a salad, my wife and daughter get sandwiches. We almost always take out since we live about a mile away."}
{"text":"This Subway made me happy!! Here is why. I go in and immediately I was greeted. Which is always nice. Acknowledging someone at any point in time is great, but a nice welcome in the beginning is better and professional. I say professional because it's people making good habits following the process to make impressions. They are people like you and I. 

The location was clean, the tables were wiped down, the floors looked good and all of the food was maintained with no remnants laying all over. Clean eating areas are always key and they got it. 

My sub was don't just the way I like it and customized with the most random mixture of ingredients I want, but hey, it's what I want. I had a smile from the lady all the way through the ordering. My sandwich artist was on point!

You know you have to get a cookie. The softer the better and these were soft. It's a must. 

This location is also open 24 HOURS a day!! Not many like that around the area and I'm sure I will be back for a late night snack. 

I like, actually love that the owners name and contact info is posted right when you check out on the wall. It shows pride in ownership. For someone who owns something with that type of customer volume is big. Another reason for the 5 star rating. 

Overall my experience was great. I will be back, obviously."}
{"text":"Not the best Subway to go to during the corporate lunch hour.  Plenty of staff working but not efficient. Place was clean, parking can be difficult due to traffic.  Employees in a bad mood.  :("}
{"text":"I always get the Philly Cheesesteak and absolutley love it. I get it with lettuce, tomatos, green peppers, olives, banana peppers, salt and pepper along with mustard and mayo. Amazing! I suggest everyone try it once.The picture I took of it is terrible but the taste is awesome =) I also get the big pastrami sometimes but it's not as good as the Philly Cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I mostly go to this Subway in Ahwatukee due to the location and proximity to my home.  The staff whom I generally see the same members of, have always been friendly and the service is usually pretty good except when you get those annoying customers who act like they've never eaten a sub before.  

Overall, not too shabby."}
{"text":"Get it together. How the hell are you gonna have only 1 person on duty. There's a line of 5 people with only one person working. literally waited 15 minutes to get my sandwich started. Terrible service."}
{"text":"I really like Subway and I wanted to really like this location, since it's so close to my new office. But....they need more staff for the lunch rush and could definitely provide service with a smile."}
{"text":"Subway is Subway and you should have correct expectations when you go there. They offer a variety of what I consider healthy sandwiches compared to other fast food options. If you stick to the daily specials, you can get out of there for under $6 for a 6\" sandwich, large drink and chips (or cookies). I like that I get to personally instruct every ingredient that goes on each sandwich. That way, they are always exactly what I want. If you stray from the daily special, the price edges up to where I would consider other options that have premium subs (Jersey Mikes, Jimmy Johns, etc). This is my go-to place for a fast, inexpensive but good workweek lunch. The employees here are nice & friendly. The store is usually very clean."}

This is my favorite Subway. The owner, Dave, is there every day and the service and food quality reflect that. The employees here are extremely nice & friendly and most of the guys have worked there for many years and you can tell they have fun working there. The store is always very clean.  This is in a busy center so expect the parking to be tight at peak times. Before I moved my office, I ate here at least 3 times a week and usually 4 times and had been going there since before the new center was built and they were in the corner suite of the tired office/retail complex that used to be on this site. Moving our office away from this Subway was a bad thing. Even now when I occasionally drop in there, it is like a reunion. I miss Dave's Subway. It is the best Subway."}

The assistant manager, Gabriel, is very nice & friendly as are the other people that work there. The canned greetings from them of \"Welcome to Subway\" the minute you walk in is not needed though. Shanice, the manager, does run the shop with an iron fist and does occasionally rub people wrong with her strong personality. There are a number of Manager of the Month awards on the counter so corporate likes what she does. I have only had good experiences with her though. The store is usually very clean unless they are in the middle of a lunch rush.  I typically go there mid-afternoon to avoid the lines. I go here 3-4 times a week so I guess that tells you that I think this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Its subway so you kind of know what to expect. Everything is alright and to standard but nothing is that great. The place doesn't seem the cleanest and the staff aren't the most friendly. The sandwiches come out about the same as all the other subway locations."}
{"text":"Love this location! Anthony and Evelyn are so nice and upbeat. Always a fun experience. Glad they work at this location. Definitely my benefit."}
{"text":"Subway is subway, it's the same everywhere. Most of the time you have to ask for double meat which they charge a pretty penny for. 

Make sure to use the app it's makes things faster! Order, pay and pick up."}
{"text":"I showed up at 9:30 and when I walked in I was told they were closed.  They closed at 9:30 not 10 like it says everywhere.  The girl came from the back and was kind of rude about it too.  Telling me they are a franchise, and can do what they want and they were closing early.  Well, I have other choices too, and will not be back."}
{"text":"Extra charges for meat change on a BMT, only branch that try's to charge 75cents per 6 inch. Employees blame the owner, I will definitely never come back to this location."}

{"text":"They charge for bags and don't always ask if you want a bag. As I'm eating my food inside... I realized she never asked me and just gave me a bag. And today I decided not to get a receipt . Last time I said yes to a bag they didn't tell me they charged. Sooo if you're getting lunch just to go back to work- maybe just being your old grocery bag :)"}

I have loved my local Subway from the very beginning! I hate to even confess this to you guys but I eat at this location probably 4 + times a month depending my mood and work schedule. That being said the staff is helpful, the chips are stocked, and I'm always happy and full when I leave. 

Thank you to the Management + Staff for keeping me feed for so many years lol!"}

I'm sorry but no one should have to wait this omg and the poor employee is trying the best he can to hurry. I have a video and enough proof to show that this Subway is busy and not enough customer services."}
{"text":"seriously, i feel weird reviewing a subway.  but i installed the Yelp app for my iPhone and i try to check in everywhere i go.  so i was prompted to write a review after dining here.

i sort of feel like a hypocrit going to subway with my extreme disdain for their spokesperson.  i sort of feel like michael bolton in \"office space\" when it comes to subway.  paraphrased \"there WAS nothing wrong with the name Jared until that no talent fat guy got skinny eating subs.\"

anyway, this is an okay location in the basement of the wells fargo atrium next to johnny burrito.  they are courteous and friendly."}

{"text":"Not sure what's up with the Italian herbs and cheese bread at this location but it just doesn't taste the same. Clean set up, friendly staff but eh it's subway. I rather go to the one on 24th St and Indian School, their bread doesn't taste weird at all even within a few hours. 

I'm giving them two stars because one out of four times I've been there, the bread was good. Wishing this location the best of luck!

Also, beware of parking it's shared along with all the other businesses around. May be difficult during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Being vegetarian Subway is always a great choice. Last week I came in and ordered a veggie sub and a cup on minestrone soup. However, when I got back to the office and had a spoonful of soup I quickly realzied it wasn't minestrone it was vegetable beef soup!! I can't eat beef and had that awkward moment where I needed to decide if I was going to swallow the soup or spit it out in front of my boss. Needless to say, I was not happy.

I took the soup back after work expecting an apology and my money back at the least. They explained to me they don't have a sign for vegetable beef soup and it's close enough. The apology I got was forced and meaningless. 
They would not refund my money, they wouldn't give me a gift card for a future visit, they did nothing besides offer me a sandwich. No, I don't want a sandwich I would not be able to eat it before it went bad, I wanted my money back. 

Needless to say after the way I was treated by the management staff I will avoid this location at all cost."}

Anyway we ordered 2 6-inch steak and cheese subs for $3.99 each as part of their promotion. Our server was very polite and made our sandwiches very well with care. Even had a sense of humor to strike up a conversation about our cheesecake from Uncle Tetsu's (best cheesecake ever)."}

But over all for the people working, a young man and a little older woman, it was great. They were quick and efficient and the food was great. I feel bad because the others in front were impatient and mean but they handled it very well. Have been coming to this place for over a year and won't change anytime soon. The employees were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Since I work late, I stop by here about once a week to pick up dinner on my way home. This is usually around 1 a.m. when there is no long lunch line. Still, there always seems to be at least one customer hanging around. I am usually greeted pretty quickly, food is made very quickly to my specifications, and what can be more simple than that. I only give it 4 stars because once I came to give in to my sweet tooth and they were totally out of cookies. But, it was 3 in the morning and if I would have waited a whole six minutes I could have gotten some. But when you're tired and you just want to go home, six minutes is a long time.  Other than that,  no complaints."}
{"text":"i often stop here on my way to work at 12:30 pm and always have a good experience.  food is fresh and good.  people are friendly.  once i went when it was very busy and i didn't want to be late for work, so i tried capriotti's down the road.  i paid much more there for a sub that really wasn't much better than subway.  lesson learned."}

Great staff.
Husband and wife are approachable and welcoming.
I don't see what's wrong with parking (someone else's review) ....I park and walk in. 
Fresh.

{"text":"This Subway location is right across from Old Kennedy.

I can't believe there is no review or business location for this Subway. This restaurant has such POOR service. I went in a few weeks ago. Normally I go to the Subway Restaurants by Kennedy by Milliken Community Centre (which is ahhhmaazing) or the Jane and Finch location (close to my work)

This Subway was on my way home. So I stopped in to grab a quick sub for myself.

The lady who came out to help me was in the back... She took her sweet time coming out.

Then I could tell she wasn't feeling well (RED FLAG - 1 - I should of left)

Then she proceeded to take my order. I ordered a 6 inch sub with a coupon for 99cent extra 6inch. 

She gave me 6 spinach leaves on my 12inch sub (RED FLAG - 2- I should of left) six....leaves....she counted it and ...... I was horrified.... (RED FLAG - 3 - I should of left)

Then when I was paying for my sub - I requested a tea instead of a POP which she slammed the cup down at me....

She said how my coupon I had (buy a 6 inch and get the other 6 inch for 99cents) didn't allow tea but POP.

I told her how I've used the same coupon at the Kennedy location and my co-workers at the Jane and Finch Location all allow tea or coffee. And I've always bought a TEA at the restaurants since I don't drink sugary drinks. 

So she started to argue with me. I said please check with your manager. She proceeded to call someone on the phone. Now, there is already a line-up of a few other people waiting now because she is taking her time and being very dismissive. 

The person on the phone said - yes to the tea and that they allow it. She didn't even tell me what the person said to me on the phone. I had to ask.

I told her I would NEVER step in this location again.

FINALLY I LEFT!

I couldn't believe how CHEAP and RUDE this Subway employee was.  I should of just walked out. What I thought would of taken maybe 10 minutes turned into a 35 minute order.

Never again - Subway on Steeles (Across from the Pacific Mall and Where Staples used to be)"}
{"text":"This this worst fucking subway I've ever been too. It needs to be shut down asap. Horrible employees!"}
{"text":"Grossest thing ever! I had to ask the foodhandler to change his gloves as he was handling dirty money when cashing customers out and then using the same gloves and putting them in the vegetables and on customer's sandwiches!! So gross! They were obviously understaffed because they only had 2 people there and one of them was handling food AND dirty cash at same time. It was absolutely disgusting. I will NOT be returning to this subway ever again! Hope the management makes some serious changes. The health inspector would close them down for these actions. And it's good way to pass on bacteria to the customers. Not appetizing at all. YUCK"}
{"text":"They may have a clean establishment but they're very stingy when it comes to making their sandwiches. When it comes to making a 6 inch Subway sandwich you need three tomatoes not two. When you deliver cookies to your customers you should give them the cookies and not make them reach for it. Maybe it's the fact we are in uptown Phoenix Arizona but I was very unhappy about their customer service so be careful about coming to this location. Fuck it, in fact the entire franchise has gone down in the last 15 years, and you really don't get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that I had a coupon and subway wouldn't honor it. It's my fault for not asking but they should have mentioned it to us. I paid almost 20.00 for two foot longs, a medium drink with extra cheese in one of the footlong. Do yourself a favor and go to flamingo and jones down the road where they honor coupons."}
{"text":"Quick, delicious and a great healthy choice when in a hurry. This location is typicaly always fast, and friendy and priced resonable too! Sometimes more smiles then others, could be little more happy and chatty.,,,"}
{"text":"Dylan made me a beautiful sandwich.  Friendly staff and Dylan shows he enjoys his job."}
{"text":"Well everyone has heard of subway....

What makes this one different? The lack of care and the assembly line like atmosphere in making anyone's sub.

It seems like they don't refrigerate their food (caught them removing food clearly from yesterday at 7am to make way for the breakfast stuff.

If that alone wasn't concerning, the fact there isn't a single staff that seems to listen or lack the technical know-how to put together a sub...

If anything a franchise should have standards for everything including the people they hire however that isn't happening here 

OH just in case you were wondering this steak cheese was an assault on my nostrils and my pallet...thank you subway another $8.00 wasted"}
{"text":"I have always received good service when stopping in to pick up sandwiches.  Main part of the restaurant always appears clean."}
{"text":"From 2/28/15
Came in here before going food shopping because it was pretty much on the same street. It is your typical Subway set up, nothing special. Our subs were made good, not sloppy; the staff was fast and efficient. No real complaints."}
{"text":"I have a hard time wanting to get a sandwich from two boys who are outside IN FRONT of the shop smoking cigarettes....especially when you decide to just flick your cigarette on the ground instead of putting it out and tossing your bud in the trash...not only that but you disappear in the back to grab gloves so who knows if you've even washed your hands...I get that it's cold boys but if you REALLY needed to smoke try doing it where patrons don't have to see you..."}
{"text":"They are very stingy with the toppings here. They barley put on any lettuce, tomato, cucumber, spinach, etc. What they put on my sub looks like if I asked someone for 'a little bit of lettuce'. We had the same experience at another nearby Subway as well-- maybe it is a corporate thing?? Also, the tomatoes were kinda yellowy and the veg doesn't look all that fresh. They did good with the meat and cheese so I guess that's something. And they were friendly."}
{"text":"I've never really played indoor football much, just the odd drop in.

We went here for a Calgary Corporate Challenge Ultimate Frisbee game. The place was big enough to accomodate a record attendance-who weren't here this night because lets face it, who wants to watch a bunch of cubicle rats pouncing on floating discs and arguing about \"team dynamics\". The parking lot is quite large as well and the drive here is not too confusing, despite being located in the industrial area.

Theres a subway restaurant available for hungry players and spectators, as well as a sports pub where you can drink with your boss and make \"friendly\" conversation with the opposite teams.

Ah who am I kidding? We got SLAUGHTERED at ultimate frisbee. 6-26 is not a score, it's a beating."}
{"text":"Average Subway, nothing new or special about this location. 
Service has always been bad here. Workers need to bathe more and not vulgarly flirt with coworkers."}
{"text":"Great little Subway by the Harbourfront. The gentleman toasted my 6\" Turkey sub to perfection with a healthy amount of veggies."}
{"text":"For a build your own sandwich shop  we all know what we are getting at Subway and maybe once every few months I need a subway turkey sandwich. This store is clean, the employees were friendly and the food was fresh and tasty. Just what I needed ;) thank you!"}
{"text":"Every team member is friendly and helpful. When they discontinued the Jalapeno Cheese bread I kept asking for it so they made me some. How great is that! These folks are the best."}
{"text":"Probably the most sloppily, careless, poorly constructed and cross contaminated sandwich I have ever received from a Subway. After watching the employee mangle a salad I was afraid to see how he'd make my sandwich. And unfortunately my fears were confirmed. Dirty work surface, dirty gloves, items thrown in a heap instead of being distributed evenly across the sandwich. It was lunchtime but they weren't exactly slammed. I eat at a lot of Subways and you never know what you're going to get, but this was the worst. Even the napkins he gave me were covered in mustard and who knows what else.  Although this is the closest location to my work I can guarantee you I will drive the extra mile or two to the next closest franchise over."}
{"text":"You need to have supervision at all times, especially if your going to leave new workers that aren't experienced alone in the restaurant. I don't blame the workers I blame management."}
{"text":"The other guy that rated this Subway was right on target. Not only expensive ($3 for a bottle of Pepsi and $11 for a footlong sub) but it is very slow service, dirty inside and no where to sit in the area. To top it off the short lady cutting the bread is probably the rudest fast food employee I have even run across 

My suggestion is to keep walking toward the C-7 gate and the are 5 or 6 clean - nice restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered the pizza without any real expectation
on what a subway personal pizza would be like. I have however had personal pizza(s) at Pizza Hut, Domino's etc. And when I look at the comparison Subway is a few stops  short of a quality personal pizza. And I say this because from the moment the lady brought the pizza out from the back I was thinking 4 stars. I ordered a subway pizza not a McCain frozen pizza. Then I got the. Bill I was told I get one meat for free, this however was not the case. $3.00 per meat, and you get a very minimal amount. Flavour was ok because you can taste the free veggies. They add a bit of flavour, the meat adds nothing!!! at 4.99 + 3.00 for your choice of meat you can get a much less expensive and much bigger pizza at little Cesar's."}
{"text":"Got a oven roasted chicken sandwich, she charge me for a chicken bacon ranch. This was the Hispanic lady working on 12/19 named Gabby. She's in insisted on telling me that the charger same amount for the oven roasted chicken sandwich which was 6.95 on the menu as the 8.95 chicken bacon ranch. Don't eat here these guys make up their own prices, maybe they're on commission! Pretty bad service if you ask me"}
{"text":"Usually I don't even go to Subway but lately I've been having a weird craving so 6-inch Turkey Subs are all I've been eating. This particular Subway is great. The employees are nice and well put together (no tweakers here!)...but anywho, the Turkey is always fresh, along with the bread, Italian Herbs and Cheese ftw! And they're super fast, might give Jimmy Johns a run for their money. And last but not least, it's a clean establishment!! There's nothing than I love more than to see a clean restaurant, the customers do appreciate it...well at least I do. Anyways, if you do crave Subway occasionally, I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch, no wait which was a plus. Staff was super friendly! Ordered Black Forest ham on flat bread, toasted, it was really good, just enough toppings."}
{"text":"First time placing my order thru there subway app, super easy and I ordered a few sandwiches. Definitely will use that app again. Food was ready when I arrived. 

The orders were correct, but wasn't a fan of the tuna. Maybe it was sitting too long, just didn't taste right. Won't be ordering another tuna sandwich again. Hope I don't get sick ;("}
{"text":"Brandi is awesome. She is so friendly, had amazing customer service, and smiled the whole time!"}
{"text":"I always really enjoy this Subway. I am a very picky Subway customer. I like my sandwich a certain way and a can be a bit frustrating to the staff member making it. I have had represent it is at Subways roll their eyes or even make comments about how I order my sandwich and that has never happened at this location. I was there again yesterday and she was so polite and she even gave me a free cookie to try when I ordered a Macadamia she said have you tried the raspberry cheesecake at? I hadn't and then when I got home I found the raspberry cheesecake and my bag of cookies and it wasn't charged for. I think that is a great thing for employee to do especially to retain customers. I will put this on here just so everyone knows what my favorite sandwiches I like the Italian BMT. I order it this way on jalapeno bread with American cheese and that I have it toasted. I think it light lettuce, tomato, onion, extra extra extra pickles, salt and pepper, vinegar and oil, parmesan and oregano, ranch dressing, and finally I get three sides of the sweet onion sauce. That's what's great about Subway you can order the sandwich exactly how you like it and not go through the hell of cutting up each individual item and buying all of these sauces. It's very reasonably priced and if you want you could get a pretty darn good cook at the end."}
{"text":"FYI: they do not accept Subway coupons at this location. This is the closest Subway location to my house, yet I will never return. Their bread is not fresh. Their servers are rude. They seem to fall far below the standard one would expect from Subway."}
{"text":"Run by college students for college students. Which is good if you are a UW student, bad for everyone else. I have seen fellow students get fat sandwiches and extras for no extra cost. While the rest of the world gets a skinny sandwich and crap service.
I only go here if I have no other choice. I suggest going down the road to University Station and hit the Subway there. Better service and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love subway but not this one. Normally I wouldn't write a review on subway but I think this location is the worst. Customer service is seriously lacking. So bad since this is in my neighborhood. 

Every time I walk into a subway I get welcomed \"hi welcome to subway\" either once I step in or walk up to the counter. Which is good customer service.  This didn't happen. 

First off there were three girls working. Not one could say hi??? Ok what ever, how about how can I help you? Nope! I walk up and I get the girl who hates her life with the ponytail on the very top of her head which btw her hair is so long it still goes past her shoulders and no hair net!!! Seriously I don't want your hair in my food!!! So I walk up and get \"are you ready?\" With an attitude too! Everything she asked was in a I hate my job why are you bugging me kind of way. 

So I got my food and sit down, no napkin.  I look around no one had a napkin. So are napkins and friendly service too much to ask for here??? Oh and a receipt please!!! So I'm still sitting here because I am kinda shocked."}
{"text":"I'm very pleased with this subway!!! Jazzi is the best!!! She always takes care of us when we come in.  She knows exactly what we order every time!! Always happy and great customer service from her!! She's great!"}
{"text":"Very good at making subs here at this Subway in Walmart. They are always polite and friendly when we have been here. They put enough toppings on (i.e. lettuce, tomatoes, etc).  The toppings look fresh when I have been here. And if a few toppings look off the staff actually knows not to use it and will make sure your sub has the most quality ingredients. Without you having to say something! Imagine that. As they should anywhere you eat really. The $6 footlong is a pretty good value."}
{"text":"Nooo! Not only was the guy rude, but he said this subway doesn't give subway points and refused to honor my free sub! After all that he pretty much asked for a tip. We laughed. I said \" I spent your tip buying my FREE sub\" my friend said \" here's a tip, don't be a jerk\" and we left."}
{"text":"I always feel dirty walking into this sandwhich shop. Not sure what it is but it feels well used and not the cleanest. On the plus side its close, the subs are good, and it seems that there is never anyone in..."}
{"text":"We decided to have subway for dinner...we were in the area and felt that this subway was the better of locations and choices. As we quickly realized was the exact opposite...here is my review...in the pictures is two I have uploaded showing my concern...

The first thing I noticed was a gentleman spraying down the walk way infront of the store...I won't express the lack of education this is during busy..hot hours. If u look closely at the pictures u will notice he has no yellow wet floor signs out...very dumb..so he is spraying the water and it hits my car...FAIL! Now I usually wouldn't bark about this but my sister in law is pregnant and all we need is for her to fall due to this. Once was walked into the restaurant, the dang water hose was laying in the ground were customers could easily step on it and trip...this is also pictured. Now ur saying well where should it go it's a hose...no one as there warning us of the hose or a hazard sign wasn't up...very serious...if someone trips and falls and the restaurant knows of the failure...my yelp is about lack of proper hazard awareness!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch today and got to chat the owner who recently bought this store. She was very pleasant and is working hard to make the store a nice place. Check it out and ask for Heidi."}
{"text":"Hit or miss here. One of the girls that works in the morning is fantastic. If it were just for her this place would get 5 stars, however, the other morning girl is TERRIBLE. Rude, stingy on all toppings on your sandwich (uses half of what every other Subway uses on the same sandwich yet still charges full price). When my office was in this area I would order the same thing with both and the price was about $2 different between the two. I no longer work on this side of town so I am happy that my start to the morning is no longer a gamble."}
{"text":"This Subway is TERRIBLE. The workers there are so incredibly rude when it came to making my sandwich. They rolled their eyes frequently and just made me feel unwanted even though it was nowhere near closing time. Avoid this place and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"EAT FRESH...................DONUTS?

How often do you see a Subway share the same room with Winchell's Donuts? NEVER.

So you want to eat healthy by getting a 6 inch turkey on wheat. Maybe a footlong if you're hungry. Of course lots of extra vegetables. 

As you move over to the cashier, BAM! DONUTS! It hits you hard like a bad vague topic on the Vegas Yelp Talk Thread.  So much for eating healthy. When a chocolate glazed donut is screaming out at you, you cant help but rescue that poor, sugary, chocolate goodness from it's glass case dungeon.

Ok so this review kind of strayed off the main road and into a dark forested area so let me try to restore order.

If you are not easily distracted by shiny things then you should always take advantage of Subway's specials every month. There is always a designated footlong for 5 bucks. So far, every February is Februany. You can get most of their footlongs for 5 bucks. The premium ones this year they have for 6 bucks.

Other than wanting a footlong roast beef on a maple bar, I dont see why they have Winchell's up in here. Its like trying to run a marathon with stilettos on. It's just not a good idea.

Service here is hit or miss depending on who just happens to be working at the time. Some of them see it as just a your basic minimum wage job. Others just plain dont wanna work. 

On a positive note, the wifi signal is very strong from the Starbucks next door so you can stay here all day and play World of Warcraft or whatever choice of game you are addicted to. Im sure the employees will leave you alone as long as you buy a sandwich or two.

So to me its just ok. Every time I have gone here, it's a different atmosphere. Sometimes good. Sometimes bad."}
{"text":"It's subway....you know what you're getting into. They are mostly the same. Froendly manager here. Always clean and looks good. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"very very very slow service. The guy put the wrong kind of sauce on my sandwich and rather than offering to make it again he sat there for five minutes and try to scrape it off with a knife and throwing parts of the sandwich away. What a ridiculous experience. And to top it off the soda machine was not functioning properly. WORST subway experience ever"}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly service. Good soup as well. Mmmmm... Broccoli cheddar. Best subway location in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Our sandwich artist made a good sandwich. She wasn't holding out on the meats, cheese etc. We had good service !"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and nice but sloppy and kind of cheap with the condiments. Normally when I go and ask for pickles and pepperchinis I get half a handful and I don't get charged extra for it. I got 3 pickles and 4 peppers on a foot long. I wasn't happy but it was too late. This experience has taught me not to come to the strip at 1 am for food. Overpriced and poorly prepared."}
{"text":"I was in this location on 6/14 at approximately 11:30 a.m. and have never been served at a Subway by such a group of unfriendly workers. No one said hello, no one smiled, no one thanked us for coming in, and the girl at the cash register acted as if we were a bother to her. If I worked or lived nearby I would never go into this subway again."}
{"text":"When you are thinking about the slogan \" always fresh\" you think you will get fresh 
Everytime I want to eat and I can't find something good I go to subway bc it's easy and fast , but I don't know why everytime after I'm done I'm asking my self why did I go there 
The good thing is that they have so many option 
The bad thing that it's all not the best food 
The team is nice and friendly 
The place is clean and working fast"}
{"text":"Most of the staff is really nice and it is nice to have a drive thru that is never busy. I would give them another star but I always go through drive through and I'd say about 70% of the time they put the wrong items on the sub. They just can't remember or don't care. But otherwise it's a friendly staff with convienence of a drive thru"}
{"text":"Subway is A-OK but I prefer Blimpies !

However, since Subway is on every corner, it seems like,  I do enjoy a Subway sandwich from time to time.

Lets face it, Subway has more choices when it comes to what kind of sub you want.  They even serve breakfast.  They open at I think 7AM ? They close late at 10PM.

Subway does everything right.  Maybe that's why they are on every corner and Blimpie seems to be closing all their locations at least in Phoenix.

I still prefer me a Blimpie !"}
{"text":"Pros:
1. They packed my sandwich full!!
2. Friendly employees.
3. Open 24 hours. 
4. 5 minute walk from my place. 
5. Their pastrami is delish! (Yes I know it's a chain not specializing in pastrami, but I still like it.) 

Cons:
1. The floors were filthy. How am I supposed to enjoy my meal if you can't keep your vacinity clean? 
2. The teenage boys hanging out on the corner table were kind of weird. They had their music blasting and were just chillin like it was their house. I didn't know subway was the new hit spot. 
3. That oh so significant smell once you walk in. 

It's a Subway. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"SO FREAKING ANGRY!!!!!

It's subway! We all know what subway tastes like. The one star isn't for the food. This location is actually really clean and open late. It's for the two ladies that made our sandwiches.

One lady was making my BLT while the other lady was making my BF's sandwich. They kept talking to each other the whole time while making our food so they weren't paying attention. I had to wait until they were done talking to say what else I wanted on my sandwich. And when I said a little bit of mayo, she wasn't paying attention and ended up putting a thousand calories worth of it. The other lady making my BF's sandwich was just as bad. My BF had to say tomatoes and onions 3 times because they kept chatting!!! PAY ATTENTION HOLY FUUUUKKKKK!!! And to make it worse, they were talking about us in Spanish while we were paying. I freaking understand you!!!!!!!! 

Omg I'm livid!!!!!!!!!! Never again at this location!!!"}
{"text":"So I just went here to order a sandwich platter. I was told they were $54.00, but as I was questioning the girl about the kinds of sandwiches, she directed me to the catering brochures. Well the prices are all $38, and when I asked her where the $54 dollar one that she quoted me was, she didn't know. Then I asked if they could cut the sandwiches into 4 because I'm trying to make them little for a reception and I was told the sandwiches won't fit on the tray then. What? That doesn't even make sense. So I asked if they could just split them onto two trays, to which I was told that he'd have to call his manager to see if they could do that! The only reason I came here is because our office secretary recommended them and said they could even cut the sandwiches up into fours and the trays are $35! So either this place doesn't operate like the Subway she goes to, or the employees don't know what they are talking about here! Kind of a frustrating experience, so I went to the place across the street, who gave me exactly what I was looking for, but a little more $. That's fine, I had an overall better experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service. $8 for a sales which has less veggies than a sandwich would actually have. I asked the guys to add more and he'd put like 2 pieces of cucumber. The lady at the checkout didn't even smile or have any customer service. Then I noticed she put 3 spoons in my bag and no napkins because they just weren't close at hand. When I asked for them just sighed and walked 5 feet to find them. How do you eat a salad with a spoon? Zero care for what my experience was like."}
{"text":"What can you say about a Subway other than this is one of the most upscale locations I have been to. Large dining area with both high tables and regular tables, nice comfortable chairs and an area of overstuffed chairs arranged to make for good conversation.

Very modern decor on the inside.

As far as the food, it's a very well run Subway with minimal wait and excellent sandwiches as a result.

Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Alex is a boss!!! He makes some of the best sandwiches super friendly! Definitely making this my go to subway!"}
{"text":"I've been at this subway only a handful of times since it open and for a good reason. Every time I've visited there has been a customer service issue. For starters, The employees I've come across are not very friendly or polite, as a matter of fact one can almost say downright rude. The latest issue happened roughly about two weeks ago. My son and I where looking for a place to eat at 9:00 PM. We looked from the parking lot and saw the lights on but most of the chairs where already placed on top of the tables. We walked up to the door and saw the sign that said they were open until 10. Went in and a young guy took our order. At checkout he says to me that if we were planning to eat there the dining area was closed for the night. I looked at my watch and it read 9:10 so I said to him according to your sign you guys are supposed to be open until 10. To which he replied yes but we are cleaning the room so it's closed. I use to work at subway many years ago as a matter of fact I was the closer on Friday night(2AM). The owner instructed to open the door at 1:59AM and serve people if they come to the restaurant! So needless to say it completely took me by surprise when the employee told me that. I may understand it more if they were closing in 5 minutes because I know how it is when you are tired and want to go home but 50 minutes prior to closing time??? Common!! Maybe there should be a sign that list the closing time for the store and dining room separately. That I could understand."}
{"text":"My husband's go to restaurant when he wants a quick healthy bite but doesn't wanna dine in. Also, his choice when he doesn't want to drive far. Yesterday, it was both our choice when we decided not to cook dinner and just grab a quick meal that was not fast greasy food. 

We always take out, we don't sit down at the restaurant. I ordered my regular sweet onion tiryaki chicken sandwich and my husband decided to try the new \"limited edition\" Ruben sandwich. 

On Mondays, the sweet onion Tiryaki chicken sandwich is their special of the day so it was discounted at $6 only for a foot long sandwich; not a bad deal! My husband's sandwich was a little over $8. 

Every once in a while, we receive coupons for Subway which are pretty food and save a lot of money. 

This is the location by our house and they do a good job of having the place clean and serving us real quick. Recommended if you're our neighbor!"}
{"text":"I had a beautiful experience at Subway today Lief and Miguel were very nice. Lief made a great sandwich and suggested that I toast my onions and my bell peppers and boy was he right. My sandwich taste delicious and I will definitely be getting it this way all the time. The both of them are two wonderful amazing young men who are definitely a great representative for Subway. Put smiles on not just my face but other customers as well. Thanks guys for being so kind."}
{"text":"Great location for me! And love it's open 24 hours so instead of making fattening poor eating decisions after a night of drinking this is a healthier alternative. I haven't had a bad sandwich here but I do have a few favorites.  

1) double chicken breast salad--omg prob my favorite salad ever (honestly). Mainly because it's healthy and made fresh.  I ask for no cheese and no dressing with yellow mustard. Flavor taste buds are completely satisfied.  Fitness pal says 220 calories.  I think that is just for the double chicken breast but cut out cheese and the veggies shouldn't be much more. 

2) Tuna on wheat-- the best tuna I have had although jimmy johns is a close 2nd. 

3) any low calorie flatbread breakfast sandwich.  Even the 3 inch size is very filling!

Bread is always soft and veggie tray is kept clean and orderly. This location is very clean and never busy...maybe because this location is less than a year old.  You can usually find a buy one get one free coupon for 6 inch sandwiches in the junk mail coupons or online."}
{"text":"I told the employee I would like extra cheese 3 times and I ended up with double meat. I was the only customer in there and she seemed distracted. When I got home i took a bite and thr bread just crumbled into pieces. I will never return to this subway again."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday.  12 people in line and one worker doing everything.  Although she tried her best she kept joking with customers about being by herself and her crew didn't show up...  Why wasn't someone called in?  Uh, how about the owner?  Obviously didn't care.  Waited a half hour to get a sandwich.  TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE...  And this isn't the first time this has happened.  Read other reviews..."}
{"text":"Just dropped in to grab dinner. Everyone that was working was pleasant and my sandwich was made exactly how I wanted! Even with my request of EXTRA pickles, they hooked it up right the first time!"}
{"text":"Nearest subway to my house and they ain't got no pastrami that's like a big fat zero...every subway should have pastrami I'm just saying lol"}
{"text":"Great location and they celebrated sandwich day with buy 1 get 1 free 12 inch subs today. Fed my entire Family for $11 bucks. Nice!!!"}
{"text":"So whit can I say......Its Subway. I've eaten subway most of my life and some things never change. I always enjoy it and really can't say anything negative about the food. I will say that some of the people that work there give the impression that they could care less about their jobs but what do you expect from 16 year olds working for minimum wage......"}
{"text":"This place need to know how to make a sub! Not just throw it on and wrap up. Little cheap on the sides. You need to ask for more. Need training!"}
{"text":"I waited several minutes before even being acknowledged. The employee who made my 6\" sub was rude and impolite. She kept saying, \"what? What did you say?\" While I was ordering. She practically threw my order at me after I waited again for her to ring me up for my meal. As I handed her my card with my hand held out for her to place it back in my hand she threw it on the counter. There was ONLY me and two other customers in line at the time.) Both of the female employees were less than efficient in providing decent customer service. If it didn't make matters worse once I left and got to my destination in which I began eating my sub there was a long curly hair on it, then I think oh wow she didn't have a hair net covering her long curly pony tail. How unsanitary!"}
{"text":"I get subway text offers every week And I went there to get the offer, the guy there didnt know what that text was!and ofcourse he didnt give me what was the offer! Terrible customer service ! I mean seriously you advertise your products on your website , ask us to subscribe to text offers , and your employees dont want to give us the offers ! Even i did the survey and i got the free cookie email and when I showed him the text he looked at me badly and i think he knew somehow i have done bad survey for them! So he didnt give me the cookie lol. 

Will never spend 1 cent at subway anymore even if i am starving I'll rather not give them any money!"}
{"text":"Went there at 9pm. And even tho they are open 24/7 they only had wheat bread available.   and they said that they weren't gonna make any other breads.  And I asked \"but u guys are open 24/7? You should have all the breads 24/7!\" They were just lazy to make any other bread.  This is the only time I've been to subway and I didn't get it \"my way\" as subway would say.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Larger dining room than most, typical food. Really clean and nice staff.  Appeared to be clean and well stocked with all chips and drinks."}
{"text":"Don't Go there Was in on 3/18/2017 Been there many other times with no problem this time 
I went to get my husband a sandwich and while they were in the middle of making it a customer came and asked for the key to the bathroom with his gloves on he went and got the key handed it to the customer and proceeded to make my sandwich without getting new gloves on, when I questioned him that that was unclean he looked at Rebekah who was training him and said that it was ok they have new handles. Excuse me I tried to tell them it was a health issue they proceeded to make it I was dumbfounded paid then came right  back and said I want the sandwich remade.  Rebekah said I was wrong that the handles were brand new Some ones not trained right.  I called the Manager the next day and 3 days later and left 2 messages and never got a call back.  I complained to the website no one ever contacted me.  I will never go back poor customer service and they just don't care.
I went to other location near Smiths on Ann and they said nothing they could do each store has own owners.  No one cares so they lost us as customers we went almost every week no more!!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service! This place set the bar high for the other subways in town and the manager (Jason) is so friendly. We need more like this!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Really ghetto and dirty. Owners and management are very rude treats their employees poorly"}
{"text":"One of the better outlets compared to other subway outlets around here. Overall it's clean and employees are nice and not stingy with ingredients."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this store since they opened their doors more than 7-8 years ago. This store was the best Subway in all of North Richmondhill, hands down! They are generous with portions and usually have the bread that I want. The crew who works here are generally nice, specially the Filipino couple. While it's true that the husband never smiles (although i once managed to get a laugh out of him after he cut his hair short) he's always been very courteous and professional to the guests from my numerous observations.

This is all fine and dandy so far but (there is always a 'but' isn't it?) the previous owner has sold the business about a month ago to new owners vetted by Subway corporate. I suspect most if not all of the old crew is gone at this point. Tonight I had my first visit under the new ownership and it was still not bad. The young gentleman who served me was a bit confused on how to deal with the register for a slightly complicated transaction but he was polite nonetheless. 

I'll update this review as I continue visiting this store."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. We didnt  see the sign saying they opened at 8am.The manager was there early making platters for a party. She was nice and let us order. Store was clean and the bread was fresh."}
{"text":"I think the service here is great! Its mostly because of the girl that makes the sandwiches DAKOTA! She is so friendly and kind! Great customer service and always greets you with a smile!"}
{"text":"An older dark haired lady literally threw the meat and coinciding condiments on our sandwiches and violently wrapped them as if they had owed her money and kicked her dog. It was surreal. She wasn't being showy or silly, she clearly had some unresolved rage issues she needed to take out on a couple of 6 inch BMT's. We didn't dare challenge her. We laughed the entire way to the car after tossing our subs in the garbage and went to another location. Her coworker was outside washing the windows the entire time. Her energies may have been better served washing windows that day. We returned once, saw her working and we left."}
{"text":"I would go to this Subway once a week. The last time I went they charged me for something I didn't order which was $5.00 more. There was no manager on site and no employee trained to correct the problem. I called the manager John that day. It took him a week to call me back and then he refused to credit me my money back since it had been a week. Never once apologizing for the money they stole from me. Wanted to send me coupons instead. I am not looking for something for free. I just want to be charged for what I ordered!!!!! Needless to say a month later and 5 calls to corporate I am finally getting my money back that John refused. This is not the only time I have been to this Subway and mistakes have been made and there is no manager on site to correct. Being in the restaurant business myself I am pretty easy going and understanding. I also know bad customer service when I see it. John is a complete joke and has put a bad taste in my mouth to ever going back to Subway!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast. Instead of using precooked egg patties they cook up an omelet and put it on your sandwich. Different than I'm used to.  I have to disagree with the negative reviews.  If you want to see a \"bad\" subway, go to Florida."}
{"text":"They are ALWAYS out of broccoli cheese soup. I used to think it was because I came in late, but even if I go in the afternoon they still say they don't have any made. Usually the works are kids who don't really want to be there, I honestly think they're just too lazy to make it. Very frustrating. Why have it on your menu if you never make it / offer it? I live right by this Subway, but I drive all the way down to the one on Windmill ( by Shaku Ramen ) because their staff is so much friendlier and they always have the soup on hand."}
{"text":"The worst experience at subway. The moment i walked in Jennifer was cleaning the floor with no acknowledgement or any greeting, and Max was helping another customer 10 min of waiting and she is still cleaning until her co worker told her if she can help me. She doesn't even say hi and absolutes terrible customer service. At least the other guy ( max ) was nicer and well mannered but this girl is telling stories while making me sandwich to the other guy and keeps forgetting my order and makes faces and funny noises explaining her stories which was just unprofessional. 
Just disappointing. I know its just a subway and not much expectation but hopefully their management will hire descent employees in the future."}
{"text":"You got to love it when the staff knows your order, and gets its perfectly correct every time. Fast and great location."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING! Went last night and got a meatball sub. I should've known not to eat it, because the meatballs were barely warm. There has to be other people in the area that ate it as well...I have been puking all morning long and have had all the symptoms of food poisoning."}
{"text":"Just left this location. Three boys are working and all were in the back when we came in. All appear to be high on something. There are knats flying around on the food since nothing was covered except the bread. It literally took all 3 boys to complete our order of two sandwiches which we are now questioning whether or not to eat. I've been there several times and it's usually fine but tonight...This location is not having a good night."}
{"text":"Really skimpy on to toppings. Rude customer service. Check out person was on the phone during the entire transaction. I avoid this subway."}
{"text":"Every single time I have come to this location I have experienced some sort of problem. Whether it's incompetent employees, messed up orders, or payment systems being down, this location never fails to produce horrible customer service. Not that I truly expect five star service from a fast food company in the mall, but it's sad that there's absolutely no integrity."}
{"text":"Subways are everywhere, as we all know!  But, Nick at this location is awesome!   We were bummed to find out he was working days instead of the night shift, and had to adjust our schedule accordingly. The ingredients might be the same at every subway but the hands that make the sub are what makes the sandwich good. Nick always makes the perfect sub. Ask for him and find out for yourself! Way to go Nick!   Keep that smile and personality that makes you stand out among the rest!   :)"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever Alejandra was very rude she even stated to me she was the manager when in fact she is the assistant manager at the store visited around 5:48 pm...I presented a coupon to her that said \"Valid for in-restaurant orders only, excluding kiosk orders. Extras & Deluxe additional. Plus tax. No cash value. Not for sale. 1 time use. 1 coupon per qualifying item(s). Cannot be combined with promotional offers. Void if transferred, sold, auctioned, reproduced, purchased or altered, & where prohibited. Valid at participating Clark, Lincoln, and Nye County, NV area locations. Exp 10/3/17.\" She informed me that it could only be used for sandwiches that were under the discounted menu no where does it says this on the coupon above...when asking for the Corp. Number she told me to google it as I walked out the store it's clearly posted on the door. Even if she didn't know \"google it\" was a very rude response. To add insult to injury to talk shit in Spanish to the other customer in the store as if I don't understand made matters worse!!! Would give now stars if I could!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the most hilarious subway experience ever thanks to John. I asked for black olives on my sandwich, so I got 2 black olives for the whole sandwich lol. And then I got 3 pickels (me asking for extra pickles obviously). He asked if no one had ever made my sandwich properly before at which point I couldn't stop laughing. I have literally never seen anyone make a sandwich with less toppings in my life.... John is hilarious tho, it's worth stopping in to see this big dude make you the worst sandwich you'll ever have at a subway."}
{"text":"I love subways teriyaki chicken sandwich, the guy working at the counter was great and all but the only reason why I would only give it 3 stars is.. why would you have only 1 guy working .. I'm hoping he's not by himself and hoping someone was on break or something because we waited in line for awhile for a older lady with 2 kids that was picking out donuts which took FOREVER!! But overall service wasn't bad, it's just wish their was another employee working."}
{"text":"Great customer service I was in here and the young lady ( Ashley)  was so nice and really seemed to enjoy her job. She also was very nice to my Daughter that is special needs.  Thank you Subway"}
{"text":"I think we're really spoiled in our world of choices. There are a lot of other places to choose from that make equally good subs, but c'mon.  How you going to give a place 3 stars, when you probably eat there once a month.  Great fresh subs, good bread choices, and very satisfying when considering a turkey foot long with cheese is under 700 calories.  It's not sexy, but your waste line will thank you for it.  Give this oldie a break."}
{"text":"Server Eulalia was just behind the counter talking on her cell phone. I walked up to order and she goes \"what you want\". Oh hi hello to you too???? Then makes my sandwich. During check out she had the audacity to pick up her phone and text. Also a little worried..she could've been stealing my credit card info for all I know. Instead of standing there talking on the phone why doesn't she clean up the dirty ass place??? So ridiculous where's the manager???"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday afternoon. No other customers in the place.  One of the girls working looked high.  We had two out of the three sandwiches made. When it came to the third sandwich the girl had an issuse with heating up the meat and not toasting the sandwich. She didn't understand what we wanted.  She dropped most of the meat on the counter and proceeded to pick it up and put in on the sandwhich. It was mixed with other droppings so we walked out. Employees here need to trained on sanitation."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with a friend noon prime time.  The lady servicing us was nice.  Not overly customer servicey or anything like that but I didn't mind.  Pretty straight forward transaction.  However, I did notice that it was just her behind the counter.  Kind of strange considering that its rush prime time and like 8 people are in line waiting and she has no help.  She tried her best to be swift.  But would have been nice to see someone help her out lol."}
{"text":"Well not a good day for me i am guessing, ladies who are supposed to be working were sitting and telling their friends how messed up their lives are and swearing and yelling, being aggressive! 
After I walked inn one of them had to stand up and serve me because they had no any other choice!

I sat down to eat my food they kept saying it closes in 5 minutes over n over again!

Well, i like the bread and thats the only reason i come in here but their veggies are so old that you dont even feel their taste! 

Hmmm not coming back i think!"}
{"text":"Employees acting like customer presence is a huge inconvenience. Will not return to this store"}
{"text":"We went in for lunch the other day and I was...in...a...mood. UNTIL Margaret and James took care of us. They were doing their job with a smile and pride. I didn't order cheese and told James I was trying to lose weight. He ran with that and pointed out the most healthful options and was so inspiring. We ate there and when there were no more customers, Margaret came out from behind the counter to wipe tables and straighten chairs. She asked how the food was and just made our day. We asked for ther names and will go out of our way to go to this Subway next time.They took a bad day and made it a little better."}
{"text":"This location is alright. I live pretty close so I do frequent this store. They seem to have a problem with wanting to help the customers. I used to come in the morning before work and they would always tell me it would be 20-30 minutes before they could help me because they were doing beginning of day procedures. Sometimes, no one even comes to the counter and you have to stand in the lobby for 10 minutes. There are a couple of nice employees but most of them are rude."}
{"text":"I like the drive thru but BE CAREFUL!!! The screen is not calibrated properly and it might choose options you do not want. This has happened a couple of times with toppings. Today it happened with my whole sandwich. They did replace it for me and were very nice about it. Just be careful"}
{"text":"They charged me 15.00 bucks for a footlong with a small drink. You tell me if thats worth it to you, this place is made to scam tourist to over price them. Its inside the four queens, small place, hope it closes down soon."}
{"text":"Can't believe it.  Went into Subway (where I've gone many times), looked at the menu while two waitresses stood at the counter.  Nobody else was in the restaurant.  Was finally ready to order, looked at each of the waitresses and smiled.  One girl nudged the other, \"are you going to wait on her?\"   \"In a minute,\" replied the other as she gave me a sneer.  I continued to stand there.  Finally, I said, \"Is somebody going to wait on me?\"  \"In a minute,\" replied the waitress again .  The girl who nudged her went to the back.  So I stood there some more.  After a good 10 minutes, she came over.  I told her I wanted two steak and cheese 6\" sandwiches.  Told her what kind of bread, cheese, toasted, lettuce, tomatoes and onions with ranch dressing.  She got everything I wanted except the ranch dressing.  Then she announced that they didn't have any ranch dressing.  I don't like my subs without ranch and I asked her to check again.  She went to the back, but in less than a minute, returned, \"Nope.  Don't got any ranch.\"  Well, guess what.  I said, \"I don't want the sandwiches then.\"  Whatever happened to customer service?  I wouldn't have left her with the sandwiches already prepared if she'd been nice to me.  She didn't even smile."}
{"text":"This is the worst Subway I have ever been too. Our family frequently eats at Subway and I always order a chicken pizziola sandwich. It is a sandwich that is not current on their menu but it is just a chicken sandwich with marinara sauce. This restaurant straight up refuses to make my sandwich. Refuses. I tried to give them another try since it had been a long time since I have been here but they refuse to make it. It is so strange."}
{"text":"Very poor service, I ordered extra pickles and spinach on my Roasted Chicken sub and did not even receive a standard portion of either. First visit but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I been here many times before during lunch, and their lunch rush game AMAZING!! They get you IN AND OUT. If you go there during lunch and see a LONG line don't turn around because it MOVE REALLY REALLY FAST!! 

NOTE FOR NEWBIES AT SUBWAY: Know what you want because if not you might feel lost because they move really FAST"}
{"text":"Subway is pretty standard across the board. No surprises here. This spot is kinda small, so I would say its more of a grab and go location. The staff is just and friendly as most others in this area. The most important part for me is the fact the drinks were ice cold, because its definitely heating up.

On a bonus note, this location is currently hiring if you know anyone looking for a job."}
{"text":"The customer service was horrible and the employees that were there at the time gave me a lot of attitude. The lack of respect, customer service and the eye rolls were a shock to me, seeing as I've never had a problem with the employees at this location."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. It is clean and the young guy that assisted me had a good attitude, was kind, cautious and not sloppy with my sandwich. Bread was not fully baked, it was doughy."}
{"text":"Very busy place, fast friendly service, clean and roomy for a Subway.  I had the meatball foot long and it was great, especially for only $4 on special."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. These girls are really funny. The place it self is  Very clean.  Food looks fresh and taste great"}
{"text":"Whenever I feel like eating a healthy sub I come here and get my usual foot long turkey sub... every now and then I'll add some bacon ;) I don't know what it is about subways bacon but I just love their bacon over any other sub places."}
{"text":"It was packed and it was 12:42pm when my boyfriend and I went to this Subway for some lunch!

Although they were super busy, the staff was very friendly and very quick with our order. I'm a satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great service. I'm not sure what was going on with the lady behind the magic counter but she was really happy. It made the kids smile and started our trip off right. Chrystee was over the top good... And its subway. We got a subway cheer and I even got upsold to 12 cookies ( don't ask).

I have never experienced this level of excitement at a fast food place, especially a sandwich shop. We all got not only greeted but complimented as soon as we walked in and that set the tone. Its a chain so its hard to rate them with anything too crazy, but considering the service I had to throw in the extra star to make it 5."}
{"text":"This experience has convinced me to never return to Subway. First problem was with a order on line. Showed up as the order said and the very \"nice\" associate explained that they were really rushed and that there was no way to have my food ready on time. Second time was we had a really big rush and we are all out. Last 2 experiences were with coupons we don't and will not except corporate coupons we don't have too. Just a really bad example of subway. There hurting the Subway image."}
{"text":"My wife usually goes here with the kids more often than I do, but we never have had any problems, just sometimes the service is hit and miss, other than that it's your typical subway."}
{"text":"The best subway franchise in the area.  Fast service, fresh ingredients and lots of seating.  It is also very popular based on some of the lineups (which move quickly)

I usually have my sandwich and combo in less than 4 minutes...faster than the local McDonald's"}
{"text":"I dont know what others are talking about, but maybe its because I've been there more recently.  This was forsure one of my favorite places to stop by for lunch last semester, the workers were very fast, polite and they had really good music playing that set a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I go to this this Subway because it's between my house and my gym.  I like to go  in the morning and have the breakfast eggwhite subs on flatbread. The staff here are pretty quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I am normally a HUGE fan of Subway, but I was super disappointed after I strolled into this location for a breakfast sandwich last Sunday morning. I get there and it takes forever for an employee to even acknowledge me (she was busy putting knives away under the vegetable trays). I then asked for an egg white flat bread with ham and cheese. Guess what- the toaster oven was broken! I then asked for avocado on my sandwich but they had not pulled it out yet and there was none they could give me. I said ok and continued down the line giving my vegetable choices while being interrupted by the other employee talking about how they needed to call the manager. Then the employee got all frustrated when the night shift didn't refill the bags. I don't go to Subway to listen to the companies issues- I won't be back again."}
{"text":"Service was very slow! Lady wasn't paying attention. The food was just awful and didn't like it. Hopefully service is faster and more efficient next time!"}
{"text":"Yuck.  Terrible restaurant. Rude employees, gross sandwiches. Compared to other subways this one is a dog."}
{"text":"Please don't give this subway your money.  I have been stuck going to it for the last 6 months because there is nothing else around that is decent as far as healthy but it is horrible service and they take advantage of the tourists with high prices and without the usual subway generosity.   The constantly have new employees that don't know what they are doing and I end up payin 8.50 for 6\" sandwhich that I can't even eat be course the employees will not give u extra olives but they dump the sauce on without you saying extra to the point it is uneatable.  This has happened over and over.  Hate having this subway be the closest!!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! At least for the drive thru, we ordered some sandwiches and no one acknowledge you for like 10 mins! You'd think they are making some gourmet sandwiches or baking the bread from scratch or something! Takes forever and crappy services! Avoid this place."}
{"text":"this subway was always my favorite. i'd come in at exactly 12:45pm exactly from my lunch break at safeway. i was always excited to see my favorite sandwich artist \"Stephan\" he always knew how to make my ruben perfect. toasted the bread and cheese just perfect. but one day, february 3rd stephan wasn't there for me. you guys hired a new mid shift sandwich artist named \"jessica\" 

excuse my language but f*** jessica. she single handily ruined my subway experience. she tried to talk me out of getting my normal order of a ruben sandwich on 9 grain (watching my carb intake) with mayo and pepper jack cheese toasted. she said it was gross and that she didn't like ruben sandwich's. this is BS. i won't be returning."}
{"text":"I already reviewed this location, but the staff really are the best here. I was a mess yesterday and didn't get the name of the girl who helped us, but she was the closer and she was great! Last time I was impressed, and I'm still just as pleased!"}
{"text":"Worst. Subway. Ever.

$11 for a footlong...ok, that's an expected airport mark-up, I guess.  But if you're gonna charge that much can you have better service?  The line was ridiculously long.  Our sandwich was sloppily put together, and when we pulled it apart it was not a 50/50 slice, but more like a 70/30 and the 30 part had all the meat.  My bf ended up getting mostly vegetables of which 1/2 fell out when he picked up the damn thing because the bread fell apart.

Subway may be the healthiest thing to eat in that terminal but I would highly recommend eating anywhere else while you wait for your flight...the aggravation is not worth it."}
{"text":"if maura is working when you go in just walk to the other subway 1.5 miles away and by the time you get there order and walk back she will be ready to make your sandwich. trash & slow"}
{"text":"Bought a 6\" meatball sub that had only 3 meatballs in it. I thought they'd changed the rules or something so i didn't say anything at the time. No it was not busy and yes he was counting and aware there was only 3 meatballs in it as he did an extra scoop of sauce on it."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and find them consistently excellent. The ingredients have always been fresh and the staff always attentive and eager to please. Will keep coming."}
{"text":"The employees at this location are super rude. I did not even receive a greeting when I approached the worker at the counter, I said hello and he literally just stared at me until I started saying my order. This location is also super unorganized, they were taking four different orders at one time and with a restaurant like Subway where you have to walk down the line to make your sandwich this doesn't really work. It's just chaotic. Even the manager who rang me out at the cash register was a very unpleasant. I have to say this was a very unfortunate experience and this location needs to step up their customer service."}
{"text":"Generic subway. Fresh ingredients, quick-ish service. Nothing that special. The sandwich artists seem miserable and not terribly friendly but when you're in a rush and need a five dollar foot long this is a great place to get a mediocre sandwich."}
{"text":"This subway is horrible! As you walk in there are two Hispanic ladies that just stare at you in a weird way then just ask \"what do you want,\" no customer service at all. As always, they never have buffalo sauce. Maritza can't hear so I raised my voice, she then gets defensive telling me to not yell at her. To make matters worse, while making the sandwich, she has a very dirty apron, when she bends over to get veggies, her apron touches the sandwich which grosses me out! Don't recommend coming to this location. Consistently annoying during the mornings. I have a better experience when I come at night."}
{"text":"Wow - one of the cleanest subways I've been too. Owner was working behind the counter making sandwiches along with workers. Super friendly and seemed happy to have our business. We were loyal jimmy john fans but the prices can't be beat and food is fresh. Ill be back !"}
{"text":"I've been to this Subway many times, including today. Service is always great, sandwiches are always fresh. I often get the BMT, either on whole wheat or flatbread. Super delicious. We also ordered a turkey and Swiss which was well made and savory with lots of oil and vinegar. The staff are always friendly and courteous, even when it's busy. Always had a good experience here! The cookies snd chips are also very good. We usually get our food to go; it's quick and easy to get in and out."}
{"text":"I aways get a good sandwich here, but I gotta ask, why do these guys wear gloves?
They don't take them off when touching anything else but the food. 
So going to get more lettuce from who knows where with your gloves on and then touch my sandwich is okay?
Who's with me on this?"}
{"text":"Same as any other Subway.  However, the people there are very friendly and on New Year's Eve (when I went), it would be difficult for me to keep a smile on my face too when working on the eve of a holiday.

Day I went, it was cold, and dreary and the people were very friendly and processed my order in a quick and orderly fashion.   Appreciated that immensely, and the fact that the gal that got me the super large cookie order put it in separate bags, and bagged all the cookies separate to the sandwiches.  That little bit of thought gave that extra umph into the 4-star range."}
{"text":"They turned it around! 

New management? New employees? Whatever it was, this Subway is 10x better than last year. Even with a line out of the door at noon, the wait for a sandwich is usually pretty quick and everyone is friendly and efficient. Of course, Subway is still Subway. However, now it's a lot more pleasant to stop by the cheapest and quickest lunch in the area. This location is my lunchtime staple."}
{"text":"Subway is a Subway is a Subway is a Subway.

Load up veggies on a 6\" roasted chicken breast on wheat or honey oat bread and you've got a pretty inexpensive, healthy meal. We're not going for taste here, folks, though I've come to like the rubbery chicken. 

Here are a couple tips: 
*Get your sandwich with mayo, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. It'll have the same nuances of a legit deli sandwich. 
*The chicken breast is a great canvas for the sweet onion sauce, Sriracha or truly any of their other concoctions
*Ask for green peppers and onions (if you like em) to be added to your sandwich before toasting. It has a nice effect. 

The FUZE tea with honey is actually pretty good too. It supposedly has antioxidants, though what doesn't?

The parking at this location is odd as you have to drive past it, towards the back before you can come in. Well, that's it - Eat Fresh!"}
{"text":"I'm really not one to write negative reviews, but honesty is the best policy in this case. The customer service at this location is truly abysmal. The only reason that I gave two stars instead of one is because the sandwich was actually pretty good. Unfortunately, despite the tasty sub, I was still left with a bad taste in my mouth after the rude experience at this location. 

Here's the story: I went in for dinner. After waiting a short while, the \"sandwich artist\" approached the counter. He didn't even really ask me what I wanted, rather he grunted and made eye contact while snapping on his plastic gloves. I noticed that he didn't speak English too well, and I would never hold that against him - maybe pleasantries aren't his strength? After fixing up my sandwich, he passed me along to the final phase where his compadre applied veggies and began to ring up my order. I had pulled a coupon up on the Subway app and showed it to the cashier. The coupon indicated free chips with the purchase of a sub. The cashier insisted that I go through all the steps to ensure that I had clearly marked the coupon as \"redeemed.\" After doing so, she muttered my final total. But, something was wrong with the  amount. It was slightly too much, and I could tell. I explained that the sub I ordered was the Sub of the Day. \"Sorry,\" she fired back, \"one coupon at a time.\" I tried to explain that it wasn't really a coupon, it's their daily promotion. Other locations had honored both deals for me before. She brought over the \"sandwich artist\" who just rudely retorted: \"One coupon at a time, that's the deal.\" Ok, but now here's the problem, I tried to respond calmly. They had made me redeem the coupon on the phone, so now I couldn't use it in the future. The cashier tapped at my phone to try to take it back, to no avail. \"Oh well,\" she mused flippantly, \"you'll just have to wait for the next coupon.\" No apology, no chips, just move along. 

Ordinarily, I would walk away and leave it alone. However, their refusal to not only honor the coupon, but to be blatantly hostile and rude the entire time was unacceptable. I can confidently say I will not return to this location in the future."}
{"text":"As frequent Subway eaters, my wife and I have eaten at  several of them all over. This was the best Subway experience I've ever had. We walked into a clean and delicious smelling store, fresh bread on the air, as they were being removed from the oven. Dan was working solo, and was very polite. Working by himself was a little challenging, as people started to line up behind us, but Dan took his time to make each sandwich perfect. The food looked fresh, clean, and had good crunch to the veggies. The avocado was bright and tasted so good. Cookie racks were full and the cookies smelled and tasted exactly as they should. Our sandwiches were PERFECT, bot just slapped together. Dan offered to wrap our leftovers, to take with us, and labeled the sandwiches for our convenience. All in all, it was as perfect a trip as i could ask for. This location is easily 5 stars."}
{"text":"Watched 5 people leave because of not enough staff to cover the rush. Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon to pick up a sandwich and the one employee (who was working extremely hard) was swamped and could not help everyone out. First time visiting this location and yes it will be the last :("}
{"text":"Now I know why people were telling me not to come to this particular location.  It's not the best location of this chain.  

Food is standard, which is not surprising since all locations have the same product.  What wasn't standard was that when I asked for the mayo and mustard, it wasn't put on the sandwich.  Instead they gave me condiment packets, which equates to me as 'do it yourself.'  What was so disheartening about this is that when I got to work and decided to dig in at lunch time I find out they gave me light mayo.  Not sure if this was an honest mistake or a deliberate act.  As we all know, light mayo is disgusting and hardly anyone eats it willingly.

Staff were less than pleasant.  Probably why I got condiment packets in the first place."}
{"text":"This Subway is in the North parking lot of the Fry's Marketplace at Prasada.

While doing a recent rental property renovation nearby, and there being a lack in other healthy fast food choices in the area, I ate at this Subway four days in a row. Being a large international chain, you get to expect a certain amount of uniformity between franchisees, but this was amongst the better Subways I've been to. What set it apart was the service. This store has some employees, at least at the times I was in there, that really excell in customer service. I had ran out of drinking water a few hours after eating, so I thought I'd go back to this store to fill my bottle. The nice young man that had served me earlier not only welcomed me back, but held the self-serve fountain open for a few seconds to take the \"minute maid pink\" out of  the water for me. Each of the four days I went for lunch here, there was a bigger lineup than at other Subway stores, yet the employees were working through them diligently."}
{"text":"It's always a challenge to review a franchise.  It's a Subway,  so the food is going to be the same nation wide.  Subway is always a great alternative if you don't want a burger for lunch.  Since you all know what Subway tastes like I will focus my review on the service.  I go to this one pretty often because I work close to it.  It is usually pretty packed.  I have been once or twice where I didn't have to wait during lunch.  The employees are friendly and to have the \"I hate my job\" look on their face all the time.  The restaurant is pretty clean too.  I think it is because most people take their food to go.  So if you are in the area try out this Subway.  I'm addicted to the flat bread.  I don't even get the other bread anymore.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"It's hard to write a review on a place like Subway.  Subway is that fast food joint that you alway pick when you are tired of eating Mcdonalds and Taco Bell.  You go consult with you \"sandwich artist\" so they can construct you a hand crafted custom sandwich.  Yeah I know a littl over the top, but what can i say it's Subway.  You see a commerical and then have that awful song in your head and you go buy a $5 foot long.  The only problem is that you end up spending $10 after you add other stuff.  
Go to a Subway and have a custom sandwich built just for you! Cheers!"}
{"text":"What more can you say about a Subway than that they are fast and accommodating.  Not really wanting to order out at work I stopped here to grab a quick sub and be on my way.

This location is rather new and spotless on the inside.  Staff were attentive and able to make me what I wanted in a fast fashion.  When I went to check out I wasn't pressured to buy anything else that I didn't want and I was out the door.

The only thing that might improve this location is if they added a drive thru."}
{"text":"I know this isn't a gourmet restaurant or anything, but I was not impressed with the food.  Staff however gets an A+.

I ordered my usual that I get at any Subway spot (cold cut, no cheese).  When it came to the extras on it (lettuce, onion and pickle) it was like I got a dusting of toppings and then it was smothered in the dressing.  I felt like I had no toppings on this sandwich.  The vegetables were lacking.  I like that crunch you get with each bite.  But, alas, I did not have much crunch on any bite.

Next time I suppose I will ask for extra toppings to fix this little mistake."}
{"text":"When you're hungry you will basically settle for just about anything.  That's basically what I did here.  I wasn't in any particular mood for anything fancy, so I just got myself a sub and some water to hold me over for a bit.  I hadn't eaten anything prior to this, so I figured a foot long sub would be a good choice.

I can't really say anything about the food as it is standard across all Subways.  You will find the same stuff at every location.  What I can say something about is the staff.  They were less than happy to even be working there.  So soft spoken that you had to ask them to repeat what they said and they would with an air of attitude to it.  When you do reply with what you wanted, you would have to restate everything a multitude of times."}
{"text":"Convenient to campuses.  Great stop for a quick economical lunch.  6 inch tuna sub for Lent for $5!  Can get crowded at lunch,  so take it out.  Fresh vegetable selection makes this a healthy choice.  Skip the dressing for low cal.  Pepper rings add some spice to their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Subway in my hood.  A go to for healthy, low fat sandwiches.  Love the roasted chicken breast with pepper jack cheese.  With sun chips and soft drinks a great lunch or dinner.   Nice to have a Subway within walking distance with friendly efficient staff."}
{"text":"Wow we just went in at midnight and I have to say I have never had better service! Mike behind the counter was so amazing and helpful! The other guy working with him tonight was super nice as well! We will be back and good job guys! You deserve a raise!"}
{"text":"The Subway gets one star because I'm required to give it one.  For customer service there aren't enough negative stars.  Went in tonight with my husband and the attitude from the two working was unbelievable.  We've been in before when these particular two were working so I wasn't shocked when they were chatting instead of paying attention and we had to repeat ourselves a few times but I started getting annoyed when the wrong toppings started getting put on and I have to stop her and I get the attitude like I did something wrong and it just goes downhill from there.  I was so irritated after I got home and saw the mess that was my sandwich that I called and asked when the manager would be in and have one of the charmers tell me \"Go ahead and call\". Seriously?  I will definitely be calling but this was absolutely my last trip to that Subway."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Subway's! I have allergies and one employee will usually stick with me the whole time to ensure I don't get anything that I'm not supposed to get."}
{"text":"Tried their 3\" breakfast wrap with white eggs and it was soooo delish! I chose the Sweet Onion dressing, which I think really \"made\" the wrap unforgettable!"}
{"text":"This subway is always soo slow. This was my usual subway though, because they make decent sandwiches and are pretty nice. Recently, I came in on Sunday when they have their footlong specials. I've ordered the same thing on Sundays for a couple of weeks in a row. Last week I came in and ordered my usual Turkey melt and Veggie no cheese. They charged me 6 instead of 4.50 because their new machine just rings it up for them. I told them that wasn't the price and they said they would fix it. I looked at the receipt after they charged me and it was still the same. I asked for them to fix it and they said they couldn't. They didn't know how and I pretty much needed to just deal with it. 6 dollars for veggies and bread. It's not that hard to learn your machines and not overcharge people."}
{"text":"Save money and order featured sandwich of month for $5 footlong.."}
{"text":"This is an awesome Subway! I have been coming here alot lately since it is so close to the house. I also love the fact that they open at 7am on weekdays. It just makes it too convenient to grab a sub or breakfast sandwhich on my way to work in the early mornings!

I alos like stopping by here after my workout to grab a chicken or tuna sub. I've been a Subway fiend lately! 

The employees that work here are all rediculously friendly, polite, couteous , and helpful. I have been here a solid dozen times in the past 2 weeks and have yet to have a less than pleasant experience. Lets face it, most Subways are pretty similar, its the customer service that makes such a great difference in one location to another. This is one of my faves in the city. Not to mention that the subs are always tasty too! I love the Roast Beef, SweetOnion Teriyaki, Cold Cut Combo, Tuna, and Chipolte Chicken Subs best.

Plus with that monthly $5 footlong special, how can you beat that for value! (I swear I don't work for Subway!) :P

It is a small location, so it is definately more suited for a grab-n-go situation. 

I'm quickly making this a regular spot, so until further notice it easily gets..

4 stars."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived here 6 months and just discovered that I live this close to a Subway!

I went and got a foot long cold cut combo today and was pretty impressed. The place is very clean. The girl who made my sub was friendly and put together one tasty sub. All in all, I don't know what else I could have asked for.

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because there are just too many places in the city that make better subs(Earl of Sandwich, Capriottis, Firehouse). As far as Subways go, this is one of the best Subways I've ever been to.

I will most certainly be back..

4 stars."}
{"text":"This is the Subway location on Jones, just south of Warm Springs. You will find it in the same shopping center as Thai Style Noodle House (yummy!) and Lucky's Bar.

This is pretty much your standard Subway location. The one big thing that it has going for it is the fact that it is open 24 hours a day! Sometimes I leave for work as early as 5 am and options can be scarce at that time. Options are typically JITB, McD's, Del Taco, or Don Tortaco. If you want to eat something decent without blowing up like the Goodyear blimp, this is probably the best way to go.

I guess the biggest complaint about this place is that every time I've been here it seems like a lot of the toppings look a bit old and crusty. Lettuce and pickles and tomatoes looking all dried out and shriveled up. Foul. I just don't add those toppings to my sub.

The young lady who works the early mornings is always very nice and friendly, though . I can definitely appreciate that at 5 am!

Subway isn't necessarily my first choice for a sub(actually not even in the top 5), but at 5 am it is the best option going and will definitely do in a pinch. Just keep expectations realistic and you'll be fine.

It's A-OK!

3 stars."}
{"text":"I've attended Subways all over North America. This one's got some really nice natural light and the staff know what they're doing. If you're looking for a Subway, this is a good one."}
{"text":"Got here at 10:40 and the guy refused to open the door. Gave me attitude and Said that he has to close the till and cash out and his boss knows about this and I'm just wasting my time."}
{"text":"Great service great $2 sub I'm very happy I got the cold cut trio and it was delicious. Typical usual subway experience however the stuff was very nice and accommodating ."}
{"text":"I feel like a dork for reviewing a Subway. I hate chain restaurants, and I hate fast food, so why am I doing this?? 

I feel like a super star whenever I walk into this store. It's always \"HI, welcome to Subway!\" The young men who work here always use \"ma'am, \" and \"sir\" which I think is so old school, but they really are always so respectful. I've started to keep my stunna shades on in the store since I get the rock star treatment anyway."}
{"text":"The people that work here have tried to steal from me on multiple accations! The give you the wrong amount hoping you dont notice so they can pocket the extra cash! This subway's employees are rip off artists and do shady business they are lucky they haven't been shut down yet!"}
{"text":"This Subway is the closest to my office and thankfully the best one I've been to.  The employees are friendly and fast.  And the sandwiches are good for Subway!"}
{"text":"The food is fine - they just need customer service training. Rather than a \"hello,\" I was welcomed with a, \"are you ready?\" The supervisor admitted he didn't know anything about a promotion they had going on. I felt like an annoyance for needing lunch. I'll spend my money elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times due to its close location and never wrote a review.  

Well here it is....this subway location use to be 24 hours but ever since they got robbed last year they decided to change their hours. Understandable.... employee safety and business could lose money.

Wish the sandwiches were prepared a little nice and neat. Happy eats!!!"}
{"text":"5/6/18 Lunch time after shopping again. Quick stop for a meatball sub for $5 And a steak and cheese wrap. Nothing different. Taste no different but satisfying. This subway on Rainbow and Sunset I gave a 4 stars for today's visit for quickness, cleanliness,  nice worker,  and price. Happy eats!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Subway fan and this one is practically visible from my place of employment so it's not uncommon for me to go here twice a day despite the fact I should know better. The lettuce usually has brown pieces and the bread is usually stale. They apparently didn't get the \"Eat Fresh\" memo. The shredded cheese is almost never filled. There is one worker who can't speak English at even a minimal level and she will charge incorrectly every time (luckily they have all been in my favor so far but I would watch her). The other workers aren't familiar with the menu. I told the guy to add pepperoni to my sandwich and he told me it wasn't possible because that's not the recipe. I showed him the sign that says add pepperoni for $1 and told him I've ordered it all over Canada and it's been on the menu for a year. He agreed to do it and asked every other employee in the place if they knew they could do that, which they didn't. The bizarre thing being I've been adding pepperoni at that location for the last three weeks. Also they are stingy with the mayo like it is their personal life-blood. All Subways in Ontario are stingy with the sauce but this one even more so. Then you ask for more and then add like a drop. Then you ask for more and they add one more drop. Damn, you charge $10 for a sandwich, at least moisten it enough to be enjoyable. Anyway, that's enough ranting. I'll go back because it's conveniently located and I'm an idiot but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"This location is always out of everything. Whoever is managing the inventory needs to be replaced. I can understand running out one time but the last four times I've gone here they've been out of what I wanted. Plus one star for being 24 hours."}
{"text":"I'm annoyed at this location this morning. I wanted my hang over breakfast (got a sick addiction to those rubber \"egg\" discs) and needed to go to Loblaw anyway so went to this one instead of one of my usuals. I made the same order I have been making for two years. All over Canada. The same order that's been done a thousand times and never caused a problem. I tell him to put the cheese on top of the \"egg\" and then microwave it. He won't have any of it. Says it will be too messy. WTF? That's why you have those white pieces of paper you microwave stuff on. I told him I didn't want it if he wasn't going to do it right and he just starts putting the ingredients away. Not even an apology. Lazy, lazy, lazy. Anyway, I walked a couple blocks to the one at Christie and St Clair where the worker was able to make me order without any trouble. Seriously, these folks need to realize that there are three other Subways within walking distance. If you want to be the one with the business you should provide at least \"ok\" service."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst subway in Ohio, if not the entire nation. Envision an environment where no one cares and sloppy sandwiches reign, and you will have envisioned this exact location. Slices of meat aren't separated, quarter scoops of chicken pass for full, and yes, your sub will be tepid and lukewarm because it will be toasted with many others in the oven at the same time. Horrific sandwiches, best off never visiting in the first place."}
{"text":"The staff at this location is always very friendly - welcoming you as you walk in, and making sure your order is fulfilled to your satisfaction. There is usually a busy lunch rush here during the week, but they keep the line moving quickly.

This location is very clean, and there are parking spots in front that are designated specifically for Subway customers."}
{"text":"Hannah and Nate on day shift should quit talking to each other while taking people's orders especially when they asked the same question more than 3 times multiple time I had to repeat my self multiple times!!! Focus on what your doing! The sandwich was poorly made! Never come back to this subway I rather travel the distant to another one"}
{"text":"Was OK but the tomatoes are always rotten we  I come here. I should have taken a picture.  The service  was fast today.  Sometimes there is this rotten little staff person who is quite rude. But he was not there today. 

Just the bread is always kinds of stale. Not fresh and soft."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad. They filled it half way then when I asked for more veggies when pouring they placed them on top without chopping and it still was empty. For $10?! I never write reviews but seriously stay away!"}
{"text":"Came to this location for the first time today  since I keep hearing about FebruANY. I haven't been to Subway in so long that I pretty much forgot their entire selection of sandwiches, except for the obvious meatball marinara one. I didn't want to hold up the line, so I just ordered the first one that stood out to me, which was the Spicy Italian - pepperoni and salami, topped with cheese. I probably would've ordered something else if I actually took a second to read the description rather than order by picture. I got it on the Monterey Cheddar bread, not toasted, with provolone, cucumbers, green peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, and chipotle southwest sauce. The service was very speedy, just not very friendly or talkative, and I was in and out in about 4 minutes. 

*Tip (if you care about nutrition facts!)
If you look up your sandwich on the Subway website, you can actually pull up a customized nutritional info chart on exactly what you ordered. I almost want to cry looking at mine. My footlong was 1300 calories with 3830mg of sodium! Good thing I've only eaten half so far!"}
{"text":"Ah, Subway. My family and I came here once. We heard the sandwich artists are trained in Paris so we had to come in. A young hyper active lad named Wardz helped us (he is a YouTube star). He had a cigarette tucked behind his ear and recommended his favorite sandwich. I told him to make it. After 15 minutes of waiting and watching him sweat and bleed on my sandwich it was completed! While I unwrapped the paper, rays of disappointment shined upon me. My sandwich was literally dipped in mustard and that was it. The first bite was disappointing but I finished my sandwich trying not to insult Wardz while my family watched with hungry eyes. I would rate sandwich 6/10. I would come back for the bathrooms."}
{"text":"This location opened fairly recently (last three years?) and I've been to it 2-3 times. It's a good location (or was, last time I was there ~1 year ago), and it's 24 hours. The staff are fine and I haven't seen any of the foodstuffs looking old.

It's a Subway!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location several times. The service is always too slow. I decided to give them another chance and placed an order online so they could have 45 minutes to prepare my order. And when I went to pick it up, the order hadn't even been started. So I still had to stand there and wait for my order to be made in the usual slow manner. If you're going to offer online ordering at a designated pick up time, it should be ready at that time or it defeats the purpose of offering the service in the first place. It's too bad because I like Subway. But I value my time more. For the time it takes me to get a meal at this location, I could make my own meal at home. If I want spend an hour getting lunch on a weekend, I can go to a sit down restaurant and get a hot meal in the same amount of time. Subway is supposed to be competing with franchises like McDonald's. But I can get my order at the McDonald's in the same shopping center in less than 10 minutes. Subway, no way. At least 20 minutes. If it's a quick meal you are looking for, you have three other choices in the same shopping center: McDonald's, Taco Bell and Safeway, all three of which are comparable in price and take a third of the time to get your food. In fact, I can order a pizza online from Papa Johns next door to Subway and have it DELIVERED TO MY HOUSE in the amount of time it took me to get my online Subway order. There are just too many options that are faster and competitively priced for me to continue to waste time buying a Subway sandwich."}
{"text":"I went to this location because I had to get some stuff from Walmart since it was the only place open before 6am.  And since it was early in the morning...or rather late night for me since I hadn't been to bed yet, I was super hungry and Subway sounded delish!

Went across the parking lot and as soon as I stepped in the door was greeted by Tanner.  Very friendly and helpful.  I gave the basics of what I wanted and made him choose the other stuff for the sandwich.  My breakfast sandwich was great, I love that chipotle sauce!

The place was super clean and the other person working was friendly too, but Tanner!...keep him"}
{"text":"Stopped here before going to Maricopa, Nikki and Embrea?  Were working and they were fantastic. Friendly efficient and funny. Will start coming here even though we live near 3 others."}
{"text":"I'm glad that I'm able once again to be able to get my Italian BMT foot long sub from Subway. It's been nearly three months since my Subway lunches and dinners have been interrupted and I am glad to be back!"}
{"text":"So this Subway  has now  hired  some  new workers. They can make the sandwiches  they just don't  have  any recollection  of what it is that the customer  wants up and including  the  type of sandwich. When I  say that I  don't  want  it  toasted  it means just that. I  don't  appreciate  being asked three  additional  times if I  want it toasted or even questioning  my choice  altogether. I'm  getting sick of this collective  amnesia  that has suddenly  graced this eatery."}
{"text":"Bought a 6 inch combo Italian bmt sub for lunch. Th efficient crew had almost no patrons although the St. Patrick's parade was starting to wind down & the streets were filled with hungry people. The manager that was there was the same one that was there on my last visit. I made the sandwich a combo with the edition of a bag of chips & a medium drink."}
{"text":"About the best thing I can say about Subway is that my tastebuds will never be offended by flavor when eating there.  And I mean good or bad!  The thing is, Subway is just so bland at best.  And it seems like they have no quality control over their restaurants.  This Subway seems to be one of the better ones, meaning that it's bland.

So what was I doing eating here yesterday?  A friend of mine came to visit me for the weekend and I had no time to do any grocery shopping.  Plus, I had to go do a home visit as part of my job, so I needed a quick lunch.  Quick and bland.  Believe me, although it wasn't horrible, the Italian BMT sub is far from an Italian sub."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  Let's face it folks--you'll never go to Subway expecting culinary delights.  You go because you want inexpensive sandwiches made on assembly line and you want 'em fast.  

I stopped in here recently because I had errands to do and I was pressed for time. My teriyaki chicken on toasted flat bread was okay, but only just okay.  It was a bit on the bland side, but having it toasted helped.  I had some soup too--Campbell's right out of the can.  Again, not the worst thing in the world.

On the other hand, props to the staff here--they're very friendly and efficient, which is what you want if you only have 15 minutes left on your lunch hour."}
{"text":"Lines a bit long. Due to lunch time. Like any other subway foods the same. They do driver discounts."}
{"text":"3 and 1/2 stars. Who knew the Subway inside Walmart could be so nice? i half expected it to be like a bad gas station Subway, but if you sit with your back to the entrance, you'd forget you were even at Walmart. It actually feels fresh and new and they made a sandwich delicious as it gets at Subway (despite the broken toaster). But what is with the Subways of Belmont not having pepperjack cheese. Come on.  

This Subway is actually a little nicer inside than the one across the street by the Food Lion, but not as convenient if your only mission is Subway. If you need something from Wally World, and you were wanting to smell like Subway, it's a good choice."}
{"text":"Arrived 530am. Door was locked. Understandable. What wasnt was the lady inside didnt want to let anyone in until she was finished with her one and only customer. There was 4 of us outside hungry and cold. I told all of them we should leave because they didnt want our business. Never coming back to this location. Would give \"0\" stars if I could. Fail!"}
{"text":"Subway is the perfect place for a quick bite to eat when it's 110 degrees out and you don't feel like turning on the oven. Everybody who works here has a great attitude and gets those sammiches done just right. So it looks like there will be a BMT calling my name this week."}
{"text":"I come to this location due to being on my direct route to work. Every time I come into this establishment, the manager looks at me with an attitude, act as if he doesn't want to service me though I'm always very polite continually. Then today, I'm asked if using an food card or paying cash. So I said okay, let me see how this plays out, so I answered, had me pay for the meal in advance before preparing my order. Then I deliberately sat, eating, watching as numerous other customers come in afterwards, just waiting for them to be asked the same question, at least 9 others were service, and not one time has any been asked food card or cash. Now because I've been pretty regular here, have noticed numerous times how different the blacks are treated from all others, and it's not the best. Stay away from here, our kind may not be kindly welcomed. TIME TO CUT THE PURSE STRINGS."}
{"text":"The staff (minus 1 or 2 in a good mode) are extremely rude. I love writing great reviews not bad ones, especially being business owner myself. They treat you like they're doing you a favor by making your sandwiches/salad or even ordering. Been here a few times, when a certain couple of the employees are there @ night; they're always closing early, do not clean well, roll their eyes when anyone walks in. Last night after a long day, went in for a non chopped veggie salad; arrived 20 mins before closing had to ask to be helped 3 times (both employees were chatting & loudly saying how they can't wait to leave) A nice well dressed man walked in right after me & they were so crude to him. If I were the owner is really think of changing my staff. Can't speak for everyone, but I'd make a big changes with employees; as employees can make or break a business being in the forefront."}
{"text":"I have a huge complaint that I would like to report and this was the worst Subway I had a bad experience with. If I can give this 0 stars, I would.  First of all, today it was around 3:37 P.M. and I went to this Subway in Oakland which is on 418 S. Craig Street and an employee who worked there named: \"Karolin\" was being extremely unhelpful because she had told me that coupons aren't accepted at that Subway then I asked why and showed her the coupon again but she didn't give me a straight answer or a legit reason. It clearly says on the coupon that I got from an ad: \"FREE BUY ANY SUB AND ANY DRINK AND GET A FREE SUB OF EQUAL OR LESSER PRICE\" And the coupon didn't even expire until December 31st and this is false advertising! She told me that particular Subway location doesn't accept coupons like that and she wouldn't answer what Subway location did. The coupon I got in the ad did not say which Subway locations did accept them and to me this is false advertising or she is wrong! I felt ripped off and this is completely unacceptable. I called the customer service number of Subway which was 1-800-888-4848 to report this complain and e-mailed the rep a screenshot pic of the coupon because there was no manager available on duty to talk to. Again, I asked her why certain coupons aren't accepted and why they have them if a certain Subway location wont accept them and she wouldn't give me a straight answer. This is terrible customer service. The information I reported to with this incident when I called customer service is below here:

Location: 418 s. cRAIG sTREET Pgh, PA 15213 in Oakland
Time: 3:37 p.m.
Date: November 20th, 2017
Employee: Karolin
Trans number: 1/A-246889
Host order ID: SPM20171120033704
Problem:
Coupon I got from the Ad that clearly said: \"FREE BUY ANY SUB AND ANY DRINK AND GET A FREE SUB OF EQUAL OR LESSER PRICE\" Wasn't accepted at that location and the employee would not explain why and gave me the runaround and overcharged me and was being a little rude. 

I should be able to get a free sub or gift card mailed to me next time for the inconvenience at this location. What's funny is the other Subway in location also in Oakland on Forbes Avenue does take coupons so that's what I don't get. Ihave been a customer for years at Subway and always do business but this was a terrible experience! When I called customer service, I kept getting the runaround and no apology. He said the coupon had something to do with the marketing. This Subway location is a fraud and deserves to be out of business and these lazy employees who are always on their phones texting, they don't seem to know what they are doing or seem to understand how coupons work. Please avoid this unless you are looking to pay more for a sub and get ripped off with false advertising on coupons! This Subway seriously needs sued."}
{"text":"Rude customer service. All I wanted was a cup of water with a lid and straw for my preschooler but apparently those are special, coveted cups that they do not give out freely."}
{"text":"So I am now realizing I'm spoiled with sandwiches. This is one of the better subways I've been too but still not great! The guy behind the counter was really cool. I believe his name was Kevin. He seemed like he was having a long day and we helped each other out with laughs. 

On the the food. Tonight I got what I like to call a fireball. It's meatball with hot sauce. So AMAZING. I got it on Italian herb and cheese bread with pepper jack cheese. The bread was just sucky. I got it toasted to get a crunch in it. It was too soft it just didn't hold up. However the meatballs were perfect, also go some green peppers and they tasted really good and fresh. 

They have a lot of options for chips and drinks. The have milk!!! Which is were but awesome! I didn't have it tonight I have the XXX vitamin water. Place was clean and empty when I went. 24 hours which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"I'm a huge critic when it comes to sandwich shops. You're a big name place and you're open 24 hours. Please have the supplies to serve. How do you run out of bread and not bake more? I hate to sit down and eat a sandwich I don't like. It just doesn't satisfy me the way I know it can. 

Only plus about this place is they have chipotle sauce. Other than that it's just your typical shitty subway."}
{"text":"The two gentlemen working were happy and positive and their good energy rubbed off on the customers! They did a great job making our sandwiches and I couldn't be happier. Restaurant was very clean and nice inside. These boys deserve some good recognition. I wish I had gotten their names!"}
{"text":"I'm trying to watch what I eat, so instead of pulling into the Wendy's drive-thru my friends and I opted to eat fresh. 

 It was right before close so we had made it in during that last hour rush.  There was only one guy working the night shift.  I couldn't help but notice the conversation the employer was carrying on with the customers.  I guess about 10 minutes before we arrived some guys did a run out without paying and the cashier kept saying he was \"Robbed\".  Yea, I know... Just because its sandwiches that they took doesn't make it any less of a crime, but cum'on I just wanted him to stop talking over the food while he was making our sandwiches!!!

Anyway, we finally got our food and was out 30 minutes later.  That was the longest ear and mouthful Subway experience I'd ever experienced."}
{"text":"I came into subway with my mouth watering for a BLT. I told the girl behind the counter that I would like my bacon cooked separately from roasting my bread and cheese. Why did she put the cheese on the bacon when i was talking to my friend and I turned to her and saw no cheese on the bread and was like where's the cheese. She said oh you didn't want your cheese on your bacon? I'm sorry in my many years of coming to get a BLT. (Which this is the only sub i ever order) no one has ever put the cheese on the bacon! Who in the world does that? My bacon wasn't cooked all the way. The cheese wasn't completely melted like it would have been if she had toasted it separately like i had asked. And she even had an attitude. Never coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Such a horrible service. It is taking way too long, only 1 person working which makes no sense. We had to wait more than 30 mins. So not recommended this place."}
{"text":"First of all, how can you not love Subway?  They are convenient, fresh, and quick and the food is always good.  I went in the other day and Chrystee was amazing.  She was so pleasant and it really put me in a great mood.  I have been on a health kick lately and she recommended adding spinach to my sandwich which was just what I needed.  I would much rather eat spinach on a sandwich then have to eat a salad.  I really got the vibe that she actually cared about what I wanted.  I left as a happy customer."}
{"text":"I pass by this Subway daily.  Its conveniently between my child's school, work and home.  However, I decided I will not be stopping at this location any longer.  I always wondered why it was always empty and I think I know why.  They have no sense of customer service whatsoever.  I'm sick and tired of being treated poorly time and time again at this establishment.  And if you use a coupon God forbid! I rather drive a little further and be welcomed and treated respectfully.  The employees/owners at this establishment can go back to their nap, we won't be bothering them anymore."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant really needs to drop in and inspect what the employees are doing. They seem poorly trained and even less motivated."}
{"text":"Good location it's just quite small and it's more of a takeout location and they don't have tables to dine in. It's also open 24/7 so you can't complain about that."}
{"text":"Nice location--clean and great service. The worker making our subs, Jay, was super friendly and had a great sense of humour. The only thing is that the debit machine wasn't working which sucked because I had a gift card I wanted to use. Other than that I had no complaints."}
{"text":"Turned off by employees smoking right outside if front door. Once we pulled up, they finished their cigarettes and ran and serviced us, without washing their hands!! Gross!!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. But today I had a beyond great experience. A lady named Juanita  made my sandwich and she was amazing. I didn't know my sandwich could be sooo perfect."}
{"text":"The store smells
The service is SLOW
One worker should never be working at a 24hour location especially when it's so close to the Vegas Strip
Kai Kala need to slow down and actually take the orders instead of panicking and messing up everything"}
{"text":"Watching these asshats make a sandwich is like watching the 3 stooges install a chandelier."}
{"text":"Haha, just stood there behind another guy for ten minutes with No type of worker presence, he ate a bag of chips and we mobbed it to silver mine..if you can't be open 24hrs you should at least lock your doors..lol"}
{"text":"DONT GO! This subway is terrible. I went in at 10am this morning, open 24 hours,  nothing was stocked , nor fresh. You would think so early  it would be soooo fresh. And no bread, except 1. Seriously bad! The employees were more worried about their phones. Walked out,,, after commenting on the poor quality of display. I never had a problem there.... all new KIDS working there and poorly managed.  I'm being nice with this review. Note to the owner of this location,,, hope you do something to fix this problem."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab some sandwiches before little league games... I asked if I could have a bowl for my sandwich (it doesn't really matter why, but I don't eat a lot of bread and thought it would be less messy to use a fork/knife in a bowl) and my sandwich maker (I won't mention her name cause I know everyone has bad days) acted like I asked her for fine china. I told her never mind, not a big deal and she said that it was FINE she'd just have to waste the inventory. She proceeded to dress my other two sandwiches with an attitude and scowl. When I paid I told her it wasn't that big of a deal and didn't require a bad attitude. She told me that she was friendly and smiling. Say what?? Anyway, I'll stop at one of the other subways or better yet Jimmy John's or firehouse next time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a couple times a month since I moved on this side of town. And let me tell you, if I lived far I'll always make the drive to come to this subway. 
Everything is always fresh, even at 2am. I've never had a mistake made on my sandwhich, though it's a pretty simple order.
Workers there are amazing. Always greet you right when you walk through the door. My favorite is the assistant manager. He always puts me in a better mood and makes me laugh every visit.  There's hardly a wait, even during lunch rush everything seems to run smoothly.
The cleanliness of the store is great as well, someone is always cleaning when I am there.

Make the drive to this store people"}
{"text":"To start with they open the doors well before the restaurant opens and rudely dismiss you if you dare enter. The service is brusque at best, even when there is no line. And god help you if you enjoy lettuce. When I walked for more he handed about three little pieces. The gesture wasn't even worth it. 0/10 go to Quiznos or somewhere else instead."}
{"text":"I ordered a meatball sub. The girl put one to many meatballs on it and the owner yelled at her saying that is a good way to waste profit. He kept drilling the poor kid about wasting money. I looked at him and told him treating his employees like that is a good way to loose money. I cancelled my order and walked out. Unreal!"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. I've visited before and was helped by a very friendly girl who addressed me as \"ma'am\" & my boyfriend as \"sir\". Tonight, however, we pulled up & the young guy's body language instantly made us pull out of the parking spot. He probably had just started cleaning the floors and was annoyed that he was getting customers. He dropped his shoulders, let out a big huff, and said \"Come on!\" with a huge attitude. So obvious that we saw it from our car & didn't even bother to get out. The girl at the 24 hour Tropical Smoothie right behind Subway was more than happy to help us."}
{"text":"This location is not very busy, but they do a good job.  Clean, Fresh and Friendly.  It is Subway so anything more than four stars would not be justified."}
{"text":"I went to this subway around 6:30pm on Saturday after visiting my gym. Alex (I think that was the employee's name, it's on my receipt!) helped me and was very nice and amusing. Considering the lot of us in the restaurant and Alex being by himself, he worked very quickly! 

I felt bad that he seemed very tired and was by himself, it sounded as if some other employees didn't show up. I appreciate that he kept his spirits up and didn't take that out on us as many employees at other establishments have before! 

Thank you for making my meal, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, I work in the area and have been a fan of subway for many years. Ordered a steak and cheese, employee put a very thin layer of steak on my sandwich, when I questioned the amount he said that was normal and if I wanted more i would have to pay double meat. Sandwich was poorly put together, the cashier basically dumped my cookies on top of my sandwich without a bag so they had bbq sauce on them, overall a poor experience, don't think I'll be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"They make your sandwich the way you ask for it.  Plus, they're fast and gave me a free cookie card for being in the health profession.

Three stars because I consider Subway to be an average chain and not gourmet food."}
{"text":"an absolute NO for service go to the one that's a 2 min drive away. they are mean to me 
subs are still good tho"}
{"text":"The bread was hard the sandwich was made correctly as ordered I am very disappointed. Called and told them and the girl couldn't even understand what I was saying is she told me she would tell her manager how bad complaint."}
{"text":"Ok, it's subway.... I love subway. This review is about the staff that was working Friday, August 8th around 5:30. A friend went in to get me the sub with simple but specific directions. Veggie sub on a flat bread, don't let them warm up the flatbread ! 
How good do u think it would taste to put cold veggies on warm bread ? It's disgusting & makes the veggies slimy. 
Unfortunately The staff insisted they HAD to warm it up, after repeatedly being asked not to. Then sent him off with a footlong sub with nearly no soggy (from the warm bread) veggies. This is my fav thing & it was so bad I couldn't eat it & it had to be thrown out.... I work I'm the service industry & normally empathize with the staff, not this time."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Subway. The store was completely empty but I still had to wait. There was just one employee working and she didn't say a single word to me. Really bad attitude and the portions I received were a fraction of what I normally get. I'm content going a few more blocks to a Subway that has employees who want to be there with normal social skills."}
{"text":"I don't think any of us wake up in the morning to be yelled at by a random Subway Owner? Let me tell you more... First, they go sparingly on all toppings here, even the lettuce. Second, wanted to use my $1.00 coupon on my phone. The man was angry and didn't do anything to help me when it wouldn't scan. He was irritated it wouldn't scan on his crappy scanner quickly. Third, asked him to use my loyalty card and he yelled some more. Said SWIPE NOW! Lastly, tried to pay with my AMX and yelled at me that they don't take those. His tone was abrasive and uncalled for! Despite me not understanding his accent he could have stopped raising his voice and not being disgruntled and be helpful. The place is cramped and loud! I will eat anywhere, but here!"}
{"text":"Shitty place with a shitty boss don't come here if you're looking for good service don't come here drive and extra 5 minutes to the Yonge subway or Canadian tire subway. The boss is cheap and rude and often argues with regular customers."}
{"text":"This is the worst food I have ever recieved from subway. The bread fell apart once I opened it up to eat."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. This place used to be great, but all the good employees are gone. Staff is lazy. They use scoopers now and they barely fill them when making
the sandwiches. I had to ask for a full scoop and the employee gave me an attitude. I used to be a regular, but I will take my money else where where it is appreciated. I advise you to do the same."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I went in to purchase a meal for a homeless man that was hungry and the clerk at the counter proceeded to be loud and very rude. She was causing a scene by saying he can't be here. Yet I was the one purchasing the meal for the man. Let's remember people that they are human beings just like us in a terrible situation that we have no clue how they got there."}
{"text":"This subway sucks. Its pretty clean and all but the girl who always ends up making my sub does a horrible job. Sometime i wonder how hard it can honestly be to make a tuna sub, but for some reason she appears to have a difficult time. The first time i went i just let her do her thing, but after getting home and eating my sub must of the bites were sauce, veggies and bread, no tuna. Every other subway i go to spreads the tuna with a knife just like they do with everything else but i guess not this one. So the last few times i went in i specifically asked her to spread it with a knife, she said okay and looked for one. After looking for 3 seconds and not finding one she just continued to make my sub with 3 big globs of tuna. Might sound ridiculous but its not that hard to find a knife and do your job the right way."}
{"text":"So when I walked in there was stuff all over the floor in the lobby the employee(justin) was just standing behind the counter waiting for somebody to walk in his visor was upside down like he was in rally mode not a good look for the store if u ask me then as I ordered my sandwich the guy forgot three times what I wanted literally right after I just told him as he was making my sandwich he just kinda rushed through it and threw everything on just to get me out the door shot sauce all over the paper so it got all over the bread kinda ridiculous and as soon as I walked out I waited to see if he would start cleaning after I left like normal no he stood behind the counter with his hands there waiting yet again you guys need better employees and to top it off no ice for u soda machine wtf really go buy some damn ice then"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Came into this 24 hour location around 2:30. When most employees might be disgruntled at this time of night, our sandwich artist was nothing but pleasant and accommodating! Great place for a late night snack."}
{"text":"We visit this Subway on work lunch breaks for my fiancee.  It's fast and the food is always fresh and tastes good.  The workers greet you the minute you walk in the door and they always have a sufficient amount of staff to handle those crazy weekday lunch time crowds.  

Both of us had the meatball subs, cookies and soda.  Everything was exactly the way you'd hope it would be for a Subway sub.  Cookies were freshly made and tasted as if they were baked in the last few minutes.  

Great visit.  No doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"I will have to write this from my daughters eyes.  She is the one that at here while I went to Famous Wok.  This i a typical, but new Subway.  She really like her sub and the cookies that came with it."}
{"text":"Edgar was amazing! He was so sweet and friendly and made my sandwich with love! This location is inside a gas station but has seating and everything was nice and fresh! I love coming here during my lunch break because they work fast! Thanks Edgar you made my day!"}
{"text":"Would you like to experience a great \"Subway\" sandwich made by a team of professionals?    This is the place to visit.  Store Mgr. Karen will greet you with warmth and a smile to start your meal.  Little Adam and great big Julian immediately leap into action and prepare your order to perfection.  Alyssia will remind you about desert, absolutely the best and freshest cookies in town.  Customer service at it's finest!"}
{"text":"This is the nearest food place around the providence area. I love subway and especially since it's down the street from our  house. My boyfriend stops by a lot here and they never have meatballs sandwich for him. They always have 2 people working so therefore it's always busy when I have came and I'm here for at least 20 min in line. They need to hire more staff or open another fast food place around this area. I hate coming in here and waiting 30 min for my food. Very disappointing. Staff is nice but c'mon speed it up when you have the Line all the way to the door.  Other than that it's very clean"}
{"text":"Really good subway.. Fresh bread, fresh veggies. At a really good location inside the Monte Carlo right in the heart of Las Vegas. Easy access from city center."}
{"text":"First time to this location. Very clean compared to other locations I've been to. Also the customer service is awesome. Kyle was the sandwich artist who helped us. He was very friendly and patient. Definitely will be back. THANKS !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always fast! They have happy and friendly employees. Love going to this place! Also very convenient to be inside the gas station because I can also buy other snacks :)"}
{"text":"Awsome!!! I love the nationality chips, I am Indian, my fiancé is Greek, they have both chips, my chips were great and tastes exactly like tikka, my fiancé tasted exactly like tzabiki sauce (cucumber sauce), our subs were the simple meatball and steak and cheese"}
{"text":"The wait was ridiculous inside and outside. Keep in mind there was only one customer inside the Subway and one customer at the drive thru window. The sandwiches were barely filled with any toppings. I waited 35 minutes until I was even greeted. Normally I wouldn't wait that long because 35 minutes just to be greeted is ridiculous. Shortly after the worker said \"I'll be right with you\" another 15 minutes passed. If I could give less than 1 star I would. Worst Subway experience ever. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Fast, Clean and the food was OK.  I not a big fan of Subway but I would go back.  The workers were also just OK.  Not very friendly but not rude either."}
{"text":"I will never go here again.  The blond had nothing but attitude with me over the way I wanted \"my salad\" and she gave me dirty looks when I was telling her what I wanted in it and how I wanted it made.  I like everything mix together not just piled on top. .."}
{"text":"I went into this subway three times too many. everytime I go in there and I like a specific way my salad is made. These employees roll their eyes and have giving me attitude. I normally go to the subway at 19th Avenue and Thunderbird I'm going to continue to go back there no matter how out of the way that subway is. I get better service there. this subway has nothing but a bunch of children working at it. Their friends walk in they stop your order to chat. very unprofessional. The employees here roll their eyes every time you ask him to do something different. and then get a huge attitude about it. Isn't subway a place where you get your salad and your sandwich is made fresh the way you order it? I thought it was. I will never go back to the subway again. I would advise anyone else from going to the subway."}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins before I was helped

Employee walked in 18 mins late (yes I looked at the clock)

Was charge $10 for a sandwich that should have been $7

Was told 3 cookies for $1 but got charged $1.50

Sadly I'll be back because it's next to work, but I'll be calling a manger. 

NO APOLOGY FOR THE HORRIBLE SERVICE"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, fast service, pretty convenient location! I've never had any problems here."}
{"text":"Mediocre service like the past reviews have said, if you come here expect to either give a couple bucks to the homeless people outside or feel guilty as you walk in and out."}
{"text":"Like always good price and any toppings you want. The blonde guy there didn't seem familiar with the cash register. I asked for the $3 sub of the day and said I wanted essentially two foot longs of that sandwich and said it was $6.75 per footling. But wait it was $3 per 6 inch x 4 should be $12 plus tax. He ended up getting it but took a while. He took even longer to make the sandwiches; about 10-12 min for both. He kept squishing my vegetables and squeezing them. I get that he was getting the excess moisture out but still could have done in differently not very appetizing to have squished tomatoes. Slow service = annoyance. I had him last time too and decided to let it go because he was new or at least I thought he was but same thing this time. Unacceptable. But seriously, why is he alone if he's still in training? Why is he left alone during lunch rush hour? Someone should be helping him through that so to his credit he's overwhelmed. Even a normal laced employee would be behind let alone him. Come one subway."}
{"text":"Conveniently opened every day until 4am! Good service and conveniently located in kesington close."}
{"text":"Sometimes when you just want a lite but filling meal, Subway is just the place to go.  This location of Subway is in a pretty good location, right off the TTC Sheppard station. Best of all, it's a clean location and there's a nicely lit seating area in the store too.  

Just a little east of Yonge, on the South side of Sheppard, this location of Subway isn't really known to many people.  I didn't even know about it until earlier this year! It has the fairly standard Subway menu.  The good part of this subway is that they have a self-serve fountain drink station, so you can get your own drinks and of course free refills.  When I go, i usually order one drink and we share it, then we try to mix various combinations of sodas and see if we can produce any tasty results. So far, negative.  

Though it's not too busy, at lunch with the offices in the area, the can get to be a line up.  Usually between 5-10 people, not that big of a deal. You can save yourself a lot of time if you arrive a little earlier than 12 or a little later in the hour!"}
{"text":"Yelp lists 3 stars as A-OK and that's exactly what this is.
Great price, adequate sandwiches, fast service.  I've eaten at this location several times, it satisfies and tastes on a limited schedule."}
{"text":"I really like this Subway more than most others. The employees seem to really take their time making your sandwich. Most of the time at other locations it's just a slap it together and go type, but this one has a great fun environment and that alone makes me want to come back again and again. 5 stars +!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are going to be the same as all the other subways. Unless the really screw it up. They didn't manage to do it, so the three stars were for their service.
I had to wait for awhile for someone to come out to help. No one up front. Actually UPS was there waiting also. Someone finally came out, was going to make UPS wait until I was served. I told them to take care of UPS first.
Got my sandwich and poof! gone."}
{"text":"Place was dirty.. Table, floors, counters, drink station.
The place is small and very crowded. They need to tint the store front windows or put shades. The sun beats in on the south facing windows. The donuts that are baking in the glass case as you walk in don't make the place any more appealing.
Won't return to this location."}
{"text":"When we are in a mood for something light, we'll come here to pick up a sami! There is not much you can say about a franchise. Food is usually the same everywhere. Only thing we can really add is their service. Some times they might have a large size line, but they go through it very fast! Very friendly staff, even though they tend to have Friends their to chat! If it's cool outside they have enough seating. But when you prefer inside during the heat. It tends to get crowded. Overall a very nice location."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with freshly baked bread?  This isn't a bad choice if you're eating in corporate America."}
{"text":"Do not go there. There's a short and stout woman there who tried to cheat me, charged my 6 inch sub for the footlong price and when I confronted her about it she knew she got caught, started yelling at me then walked to the back. If anything, go to the subway on Nellis next to the taco bell and autozone; and let this one die. (Also very stingy with their sandwiches)

Update 
Open 24 hrs except when they're too lazy and tired to work like the graveyard shift, wife went over to get a sandwich, was told that they were closed. If this subway shop dies, we'll all be better off."}
{"text":"This subway is the cleanest subway I have ever been to! You want real subs to look like the subway commercials? Come here! The owners are extremely friendly and go above and beyond. I went into this location to get 2 subs. The one owner was cutting up fresh vegetables and the other owner was literally underneath the tables on his hands and knees scrubbing the floors. The chips are perfectly organized and everything is fresh! The owners take pride in their business! Best subway around!"}
{"text":"Normally I couldn't fathom leaving such a negative review for a Subway as I quite enjoy eating fresh but I found this particular establishment to be most unsatisfactory.  It was relatively clean inside but there was no atmosphere whatsoever.  There was no music or anything, just utter silence.

Service was OK, two stars maybe,  but it was virtually impossible to understand the employees.   We gotta have some basic communication if we're going to do business.   Prices were definitely higher than other Subways and the veggies weren't especially fresh.  Food was acceptable but unmemorable and certainly lower quality than other locations.

If it were a small town and this was the only Subway, I guess it would be tolerable but this is Phoenix.  There's a Subway on every corner and I see absolutely no reason to visit this location ever again.

Clean up guys, tour other locations or something to see how it's done.   What you're doing isn't working at all."}
{"text":"Very very rude service!!! And horrible food !!! Service scared the hiccups straight out of my body ! Yikes"}
{"text":"Horrible attitude, they seemed HORRIBLY inconvenience when I walked in and the girl working actually got mad because she had to put her phone down to take my order. She also put the entire container of rosy beef on my sandwich because she didn't want to count out the pieces of meat. O and the sandwich bread was torn and falling apart."}
{"text":"Great location, great service I have a pet peeve with mushy tomatoes and they never have mushy  tomatoes I asked for extra vegetables they always give it to me with no problem excellent customer service"}
{"text":"The Indian woman that runs this location has a shitty attitude and even worse customer service. You guys should really hire new management."}
{"text":"Worst subway I've ever seen. There's another on flamingo I usually go to, but I was nearby so I came here... there were bugs on the banana peppers, what looked like mold on some pickles, and half of the vegetables were frozen because they're being kept too cold. The lady who worked here clearly did not give a shit about her job. Dude, what the fuck, this place needs to get shut down and have something at least halfway decent built in its place. Whoever owns this location should be goddamned ashamed of themselves, and the subway franchise should do a better job managing and overseeing their franchise owners. Get a regional manager out here to fix this shit or shut it the fuck down."}
{"text":"Average subway experience.  Welcome to subway. My total for my meal was 10.80! I think that is alot for a cheap sub. It was good. Just not the inexpensive meal I was looking for. The traffic is high at this location. Sometimes have a wait of 10 minutes. It's right across from my house so it's super convenient."}
{"text":"This subway is my favorite. They change gloves for my veggie sub. They put on 8 slices of cheese on my veggie. The other subway charges for double cheese on a veggie. The guy who made my sub even used a new knife. They offer crab which is hard to find. The staff is friendly. The store is clean. They are generous with the olives!"}
{"text":"I like subway.  Usually priced fair. The manager is friendly. Average cleanliness.  I like that I can add as many veggies as I want. Traffic is high at this location. I'm over the welcome to subway saying.  How about welcome back since I eat here atleast three times a month!"}
{"text":"Friendly service by Natalia. Nothing needed to say about the sandwiches as it was great as usual. Clean restroom was a plus along with having Cherry Coke available."}
{"text":"Slow and 3 people standing around only one person working. Didn't even acknowledge that I was in line to order from them."}
{"text":"Surprised this subway wasn't on Yelp. Lot of local places are ghetto so I come here a lot since it's close to my work. What's there to say about Subway? Unless they suck at closing the sandwich after packing it full of veggies or they can't wrap it correctly, they should all taste the same. Fortunately, this location does everything right. The staff is super friendly too which makes it easy to come here often."}
{"text":"It was around 12 and there were probably over 10
customers in line. Only two employees were working, but the wait was not long at all. Miguel was great! He had a smile on his face the entire time and really made us feel like we were important and didn't rush is with our orders."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest one I have been to and I have been there many of times also have a hard time understanding them they don't have coffee and pop machine is broke half the time"}
{"text":"Just an everyday run of the mill subway. Very nice staff seemed to be clean but bathroom could stand to use some deep cleaning to their defense I am a bit of a clean freak I look at the edges of the floors etc"}
{"text":"I frequent this specific location because it is the closest one to my house. Always a good experience. Friendly staff and the subs are always fresh and tasty. I especially enjoy their large tuna. I go early as lunchtime can be very busy."}
{"text":"This Subway is conveniently located near UNC Charlotte.  As a grad student, I'm constantly stopping in for a quick and pretty healthy lunch.  What I like about this location is that the service has always been very friendly.  And, anytime the line starts to get too long, an employee will always call for back up.  There is more than enough seating to sit inside but beware, as with any Subway, if you stay in too long, you walk out smelling like bread!

A little secret they do not advertise - show your UNC Charlotte ID card and get 10% off your order (excluding the $5 foot longs)."}
{"text":"For a Subway, I can't think of anything that they haven't fulfilled or done wrong.  They always have the bread and the all components I need to make my fav sandwich.  The employees are very sweet and don't pressure you to move along the line quickly.  They will listen to your requests (i.e. more of this, less of that).  I almost always ask for some fat free honey mustard on the side and they have no problem doing it.  I've been at other subways where they roll their eyes or give me a face like - why couldn't  I have just squeezed it onto your sandwich?  There is a very good reason, Mr. Subway Man,  I like to dip my sandwich (the horror, the horror).

Location is great!  Parking can be sticky at times since you can only park at metered spots.  If you can't get a spot on Cedar just make your next right and circle around the building until you get to the Trade St side.  Sometimes it's easier to get a spot there.  Only once have I been totally shut out."}
{"text":"This place is getting worse. Now they gave people who do not speak or understand any English. It was not so bad when they could understand very little but could complete an order without incident. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"The prices so expensive and the quantity is so bad.i bought breakfast almost $10 just 6inch sub and coffee.the employees were very rude."}
{"text":"Standard Subway fair. The staff is super friendly though   I always make sure to hit there first thing in the morning every week or so. The food is fresh and tasty. 
The place is always very clean and tidy."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW! This Subway location inside the UNLV Student Union is great. The staff here gets your order right. They listen what you want and gets your order correct. The staff here is now FRIENDLY and COURTEOUS.

So far at this location, I tried:
- The Black Forest Ham
- The Cold Cut Combo
- Italian B.M.T.
- Sweet Onion Teriyaki

If you decide to stay FIT, I recommend going to this Subway because all the subs are HEALTHY. Also they give you lots of vegistables and you know that vegetables are healthy for you."}
{"text":"This Subway I went to recently wasn't bad. I ordered a footlong Black Forest Ham with sides and got my order correct. The service was alright, long line though, but they need to hire more employees. When I ate the sandwich, it was very delicious and was very happy. Would definitely come back to try other subs."}
{"text":"This is your average, everyday, nothing special subway.  

The staff is friendly, the store is quiet and the tuna seemed somewhat fresh.  My only complaint would be the limited breads available at 6pm.   

As per every subway, not the best sandwich, but in a pinch it'll do."}
{"text":"I placed an order online for this store. The menu options included soup. I ordered 3 sandwiches and a cup of soup and paid for the order in full. When I went to pick up my order I was told that no Subway offers soup in summer. BUT....the store cannot credit me for the soup that they couldn't provide. I was told to call corporate. I called corporate and was on hold for 30+ minutes waiting to speak to someone about my refund. While I waited my hot meatball sub turned into a cold soggy mess that I ultimately gave up on. Now, corporate says that the owner of the franchise is responsible for rectifying the problem but the store told me that they never touch my card so it appears that NO ONE has a clue how to refund my money. The employees in the store couldn't offer a gift card (because corporate handles the Internet transaction), they offered me cookies. If I wanted cookies I would have ordered them.

I am not impressed at all. Definitely will not order online The website says that online ordering makes your meal more convenient but now they have my money for an item that they could not provide. It\"s not the amount as much as the obvious lack of customer service at all levels. Now I have to wait for a call from the owner."}
{"text":"I have been to this subway many times, because it is the one closest to my house. At this point, I have given it more than a fair chance and I will just drive to the subway on power and ray. This subway has nice, friendly employees but that's the only positive thing I can say. Their bread is always on the old side  but the past 2 times it has been as hard as a rock, and the cookies are always so old you cannot bite into them. They never have any tea made. For me, it's worth driving 10 minutes down the road for fresh food. Today our bread and cookies were inedible."}
{"text":"This is a review based on service, since we never were able to get food. We came this morning after a night out... It was about 3:30 A.M. We approached the door and rang the bell. At first we thought it was just taking a while... So we rang it again... And continued to wait... We saw some one in the back by the sink. She continued to ignore us. I figured... She must not of heard the bell. I rang it again. It wasn't until she waved us away... That I realized we were being ignored. We were dressed casual, but nice. We weren't hammered... Or acting crazy. We always go to this subway... We've never had a problem. I can honestly say... We will never go back. We will gladly bring our business down the street to the subway in Boulder station."}
{"text":"Always greeted by one of the friendly staff. Restaurant is kept clean, tables cleared regularly. It's always busy during the lunch rush, but they move people and product very quickly, and do it well. My fave sandwich is sweet onion chicken teriyaki on 9-grain honey oat."}
{"text":"Was happy to see this location as I was pulling away from the Wells Fargo bank at Ray and Rural. Needed to grab a quick, healthy lunch to take back to work, and was planning to stop by another Subway that I would pass on the way.  Hooray for convenience!

My immediate thought upon entering was that it was very clean and cozy.  It seemed smaller than most Subway shops I've been to, but it was nice. I interacted with two employees who were very friendly and helpful. No issues with my Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki sandwich, everything was good.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"1/28/2014. Store:33825. Clerk:83. Order: 33. I walked in at 3pm. There was a not a soul in here. I ordered a sweet onion teriyaki. They didn't warm it up like they normally do. I was told by the clerk who was actually in line behind me that they don't have the \"little cups\" to microwave the chicken. I was forced to have it toasted, which I don't care for. Then I actually had to WAIT IN LINE BEHIND THE OTHER GUY BEHIND Me WHOM HAD ORDERED AFTER ME. THEY MADE HIS SANDWICH AND HE WAS ACTUALLY AN OFF DUTY EMPLOYEE. MY WARMED SANDWICH SAT THERE GETTING COLD WHILE THEY FINISHED MAKING THE EMPLOYEE'S MEAL. The employee then swung around the counter and RANG ME UP! You have GOT to be kidding me! He even screwed up my change.  Subway has gotten too big. Too lax. Mediocre ingredients. Jimmy Johns is now number one."}
{"text":"Went there at lunch time and there was only one ! Employee so it took like 10 minutes for my turn. And also the veggies were not fresh at all
I could see the cucumbers and tomatoes were so bad she had to go through them to find some semi fresh ones
Not a good location Not recommended"}
{"text":"these guys make great sandwiches I always love to go there. I recommend subway for everybody check it out."}
{"text":"I wish I had a better way to put it into words other than to say horrible and inattentive service. 
Was the only person having a sandwich made while there were 2 people behind the counter. 
Had a simple sandwich, spoke clearly and calmly yet still there were problems. 
Never again."}
{"text":"This Subway has the nicest, friendliest staff EVER (the african-american guy always has a smile for me and I love it!).  Even when they are super busy, they work fast and always get my sandwich right.  

Go right at 11 or after 12:30 to avoid the crazy lunch rush."}
{"text":"NOTE- 5 stars for fast food joint, not the Capital Grill.

This Subway experience was fast, accurate, and no fuss. (1/21/11)

This Subway is busy and efficient.  I enjoyed an excellent turkey sub add bacon with an assortment of toppings and they made it with excellent fresh ingredients.  

If you need a meal fast and on the cheap, you can't beat this.  I was in and out fast during a busy lunch rush."}
{"text":"I dropped by this subway today to get lunch with my 16 month old son and get another sandwich to go for my husband. This is hands down THE BEST experience I have EVER had in a subway. Every single employee was so kind and helpful. I had my hands full and was feeing a little frazzled and honestly the positive attitude held by every person there really helped to turn my day around. The food was pretty standard, but the service was great. Thank you! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Sucks sucks sucks... It's open 24 hours and the dude was sleeping...boooooooo....sucks"}
{"text":"I live close by and this is my go to Subway.  The place is clean and the staff is friendly and speedy.  Would recommend if you are in the are and in the mood for a good subway!"}
{"text":"Surrounded by buffets and $15 deli sandwiches on the strip this subway was welcome relief to my wallet.

They service was quick and food was fresh. Exactly what I expect from a Subway.

The food court tables were pretty dirty and the floor was pretty gross when we visited, but I don't think that's Subway's responsibility. But just a heads up, plan to take the food to go."}
{"text":"Employee was so obnoxious and loud that I could hear her in back they whole time I was eating my food. Awful customer service and not an enjoyable place to eat. I'll drive the extra mile to the rural and baseline location."}
{"text":"This is a major disappointment for those who are following a lower carb eating plan. I really enjoy their salads, and was excited to see the sub of the day was the Italian BMT, which of course is 3.50 today. I recognize it costs an additional 1.75 to make it a salad, so we're looking at 5.25. The employee who started to make my salad didn't speak English well enough to understand me as I was clarifying the price, and the employee who rang me up charged me just shy of $7! When I asked about the price, not only did she have an attitude, but she refused to adjust it, so now, because I am leaving out the bread, I'm paying double!
Get it together, Subway! There are many people who either can't have bread or choose not to, and charging double for leaving an ingredient off of a sandwich doesn't make any sense at all!"}
{"text":"Price is expensive which can be overlooked since it's on the Strip.  Service is horrible.  Cashier was rude as hell.  So when I asked for manager, she just pointed at him and I had to flag him down.  Then manager pretty much told me to go to the website to make the complain instead of apologizing for asshole cashier."}
{"text":"This place could be a lot cleaner. The vegetables  looked old and very unappealing. Guacamole was dark from sitting there all day. No public restrooms.  And tables were dirty, but staff did clean them while I was there. Will not come back to this location."}
{"text":"after having gotten disgustingly sick of eating subway while in baltimore (their chicken made me feel sick to the stomach, and the distinctive smell that emanates from every subway store nauseated me to no end. it got so bad at one point that if i didn't hold my breath while passing by the store, i'd start dry heaving), i was once again attracted to subway by its ads, but this time for breakfast.

their breakfast menu could certainly be better organized, but the lady behind the counter was very helpful in getting me to choose something i liked.  because i didn't want their regular bread, that eliminated half the menu.  They offer an english muffin sandwich + coffee/tea for 2.50.  the advertisement claims they use fresh cracked eggs. having gotten the same description from wendy's advertisements and actually receiving a fresh cracked egg on a griddle, i expected to get the same here. what was i thinking? that's why i shouldn't ever be up before 12PM. my brain doesn't like me doing that.  The end result was the generic spongy folded rectangle egg product that was reheated in the toaster oven.  I got the ham, egg, provolone cheese, with bell peppers, tomato and just a touch of southwest sauce, and it was surprisingly not bad. i just wish they had more alternative options for warm beverages in the morning.

I was also fascinated by the dixie coffee cup covers that have a lever that can open and cover the drinking spout. moving parts on a disposable plastic cap. i never would have thought that would be a marketable/profitable product.  overall, this option for breakfast along craig st. is probably one of the cheapest. anything you get at starbucks, kiva han, crepes parisennes, will be more expensive."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy eating subway, but this subway was the worst ever, and the lady that made it had the worst customer service! I will never go to this location again, I was not able to eat my sub due to her squeezing the whole sauce of chipotle, and she tried warming up my  sandwich and adding condiments I didn't even ask for!"}
{"text":"Food was what you expect from a subway, but the service is not. I went in to this Subway that is OPEN 24 HOURS at around 3am to get a sandwich, as most people do at Subway. While making my sandwich, the employee asks me, \"So why are you coming to Subway at 3 in the morning?\" To which I responded \"I'm hungry,\" trying to ignore her attitude. She then replied with \"Oh, you're hungry?\" 
This subway is open 24 hours. I should be able to come at any of these hours without being questioned. It's straight up rude and disrespectful."}
{"text":"I go to this subway probably twice a week since it's so close to my work. The staff are always so friendly. I always get the veggie sandwich and it never disappoints me. Love subway!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite subway I have been to! The staff is mostly very friendly and treat you like family. A couple of the younger girls that work the evenings have a bit of an attitude problem but overall, I always have a tasty sandwich that seems very fresh! Also Robin is the best!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to leave reviews but I previously just went to this location and ordered a salad. The lady just threw the pieces of cheese on top of my salad in the to-go container without mixing any of the ingredients together (that is subway protocol as I have ordered this many times at different locations). The ham in the salad was all one piece and because she hadn't put anything in the mixing bowl she just put the dressing on top and now my lettuce is soggy. This location is the worst."}
{"text":"Ever since I've moved to Vegas, I've been coming to this Subway a lot, now more than ever since I started Insanity. Definitely a great choice of place to eat at anytime, especially if your on that healthy tip. This location has great service and is open until midnight 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Overpriced because of being inside casino. $3 for a drink and he wanted to charge me for a refill."}
{"text":"Three months ago I went to this Subway with Subway gift cards that were given to me for my birthday.  I went there just to use up these cards. I go to pay and they say we do not accept subway gift cards. How in the world does this Subway not take them when every other subway does? When a company such as Subway allows retailers to sell gift cards for their establishment then all franchisees should accept them. I found this tacky and assume the local owner just doesn't want to pay the fee. I won't go back to this Subway, I go to subway restaurants that take the cards as I buy them at Giant Eagle."}
{"text":"ive been to a lot of subways in my life but this has to be the 
best.subway.EVER!
they really meant it when they said, \"eat fresh!\""}
{"text":"I am so over this Subway! Not only do they always get my online order wrong, they do NOTHING- to fix it. My family is out $25 and are looking through my cabinets because the dinner was awful."}
{"text":"Employees seemed completely out of it and confused by their jobs.  Asked what sandwich I wanted 3x after I told her.  Seemed to be really exhausted or on drugs. 

 Coke machine was out of Coke but I wasn't about to wait an hour while they refilled it.

Overall, a poor Subway."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst subway I've eaten at. It's not in the best part of town. Neither one of the employees could speak much English. They just tossed everything on the sand which without spreading it out or evening it up. Just ingredients clumped together then she forced the super dry bread shut. 

Then, while I was eating. A homeless man blocked the door with his shopping cart and filled a big gulp cup up with the fountain machine. No one said a word to him..."}
{"text":"Whatever you do do not order from this restaurants online app. They got the whole thing mixed up. I didn't realize until I got home and opened up the bag. When I called to complain about it they told me to come back and they would give me another sandwich. When I got it home it had what I asked for on it but the meat look like shaved gyro meat not roast beef. On the other sandwich they had nearly a whole jar of mustard. I will never order a sandwich online because of this experience."}
{"text":"We ordered the same thing as we always do at any subway.  My son gets the same thing every time and this location insists on charging $1.50 on top of a $10 sandwich because he has a different kind of meat.  No customer service.  Was the biggest deal getting the meat even switched up, and had to ask them twice to remove the salami, (even though we had already asked for no salami). Will NOT do this location again."}
{"text":"Does not take subway gift cards or subway coupons only takes Boyd gaming gift cards, players cards, room charges, as well as cash and credit. (However, the hotel gives out coupons these are the only coupons that they will take) Also has $5 foot longs un like other casinos in vegas. Free refills on soda (Pepsi). Open from 7am to 2am everyday. Breakfast only served from 7am to 11am. The most expansive sandwich was $9.25 for a footlong. There is no in room delivery. But they do have party trays. The subway is located in the food court located in the casino/hotel."}
{"text":"I try.. Really I do. But I am a ToGo's girl. I grew up with my #9 pastrami sandwich. This location was fast, they did good with our food, well as good as you can with processed meats. :/ My only complaint is the layout of the store. Could have been configured better. I only gave it 2 stars because when I do eat here, I always get sick. Now if I lost weight, I'd give them a star back! Haha!"}
{"text":"I will be the first to admit that by choice Subway is new to me. But now it is on my regular lunch menu. How can it not be since they started toasting the bread and have the $5 foot longs! Hard to say no to a $5 foot long, wouldn't you agree.

This Subway location is very convenient to my work place and is usually pretty busy, but I have never had to wait too long for my sub and the employees are nice and talkative.

When I first went to Subway I wasn't impressed with their tiny meat slices and lack of cheese, but I have started ordering the chicken breasts and getting the cheese toasted and I now I feel that I am getting my money's worth. Not to mention their new flavored breads, really delish!"}
{"text":"I cannot wait to talk to Dave tomorrow-(given all the great reviews how he works so hard to keep his establishment quality driven and provide outstanding service) about the insulting, careless behavior of Amanda, and then by the end of this huge and escalated situation by his other employee whos name I do not know (which also involvded a US Postal worker-who was apparent friends with Amanda-coming to Amandas defense because he didn't like the way I was treating her- after I sat there waiting to order while she stirred chicken in the bottom of a bowl talking to this man about her trip to las vegas, that took her 4 hours and they made great time, and she spent the night, and she and the postal worker were so happy she had so much fun).
 the other young lady who i dont know her name was listening to my conversation with my business partner after the postal worker left and I finished my sandwich (because I was scared to leave after the postal employees angry behavior toward me) came out from behind the counter yelling at me about what she heard me saying to my business partner. I said to her, You were seriously listening to my conversation?????

I don't know how employees that are customer service can act less then authentic and genuine in their care for each and every customer.
This young lady was more interested in socializing with the postal worker than helping me- and her focus was getting done with me so she could talk to this man more while he was checking out.
She had been putting her hands on the checkout counter and some other areas by the back wall, I asked her if she would get fresh gloves and rewash her hands before dressing my sandwich (this is such a serious issue for me because I almost died from bacteria from cross contamination at a restaurant).
She took off her gloves and grabbed a fresh pair. I said, No throw those away because the sweat and bacteria from your last pair are on there and id like you to wash your hands.
She washed her hands then got gloves. I told her thank you because... thats when she cut me off and said I don't have to wash my hands except when I touch money. I said Actually you do I have my health card also and work in food and beverage and the fact that I asked. She decided to get snippy,  roll her eyes, tell me she just got her health card three weeks ago and knows. Then she pointed to a lady at the booth and said she is here from the health department, so I said lets go talk to her, she started to walk away, I was getting angry by this point and said-Where is your manager? Then she replied I am the Manager, I said then I want a districts phone number or the owners number.
Next thing this postal worker (her friend) started yelling at me from his seat-I was so shocked-then he got up and angrily came marching toward me yelling at me defending her (good thing im a manager/trainer and a business owner or this would have been way out of control) (which ive already filed a formal complaint with the Postal Service).
So Amanda is now disappeared, I asked the other two workers if she is the manager, who else could I talk to , then they said she is NOT the manager (so she was lying).
Then the young man wouldn't give me anyones number and said I have to call the 800 number on the receipt he gave me. I said I am very upset and want to talk to someone now, then Amanda reappears and yells out \"Why don't you just leave then\".
OMG , I think im still in shock that these people are not trained and act  like this business is their personal playground. If I were this owner The two girls would be fired immediately. 
The girl Amanda said lets play lthe tape. I said make sure you keep a copy of that because were gonna need it.

So Dave-please look at the tape and keep a copy handy and I will be in contact. This was so stressful for me today after a long day of training and is not something anyone should have had to deal with for a sandwich and to relax before going back to work (which I did not do because of al this stress).

PS I go to Subway regularly, I spend my hard earned money there a lot. I have never had anyone treat me with less than good customer service and respect!!! UNTIL NOW!"}
{"text":"Seems nobody is a fan, but I seldomly follow the crowd when it comes to places like a Subway being the worst or the best.You kind of have to go into these places and see for your self.They hire and fire new people all the time so I really think people should redo their reviews every so often not to smear their reputations.

Ill just speak in reference to the AM girl working there..forgot her name but she was Hispanic and fairly young.I was in line with a bunch of European tourist and she handled all of our orders in a timely fashion and did an excellent job!.

I just hated the fact that since this was in the downtown area they don't honor the $5 foot long sub.Subway is ok, but they aren't really  worth breaking the bank for IMO."}
{"text":"This is one of the cleanest subways I have been to. The tables and floor are spotless. There are lots of school age kids that work here but are well trained and get the job done. The owner seems to live here. He is always around and acts like he wants to be. It's good to see that he takes an active part in the running of this Subway. The food was very good and the servers were cheerful. What more can you say.They also have the newest of the new drive up window ordering screens. It is a big touch pad and you just touch what you want and how you want it and it is magically made by some robot in the store. (a joke). We will see how this works when it's twenty below outside. Give it a shot if in the area."}
{"text":"Brand new place with a drive through. The drive through has no speaker just a large touch screen. You can choose most everything you want on it but I did not see a tab for dressings at the end. I like a little honey mustard on my tuna and must have missed it. On a cold day ordering out here would not be the way to go. The pick up window is small and tight to the building and easy to miss. I missed it the first time and had to go around the building to look again. The tuna sub I got was dry and one of the worst tasting I have had at a subway. The tuna was just not mixed right. My wife got the second half of my footlong and agreed. I would go back but not  until it has a chance to get up to speed with the other subways and would go into the building this time."}
{"text":"There are many times in my life where i really enjoyed my food and experience, this definitely wasnt one of them lmao. The 2 young people working here had the worst attitudes and made sure no one felt welcome. Subway's motto \"eat fresh\" must've excluded this location because the tuna and veggies were just terrible. Wont be coming back here again. Also, came in at 6:30 if management or owners want to look into it."}
{"text":"Went to this subway and was welcomed by a really nice worker, his name was Bartholomew. He gave us really good customer service"}
{"text":"I generally speaking love subway, but this was my first experience with this store. . . And by far was the WORST experience I've had.  I wanted to rate this at one star, but the general consensus of the party I was with was two stars.   Congratulations to this company, here are four people that will tell about their low quality service and food.  

They got right on making our food, but the level of responsiveness while making it was. . Subpar.  When they ASKED me if I wanted my sandwich toasted, I said no, and (this seems to be a running theme with subway) they toasted it anyway.  I think they blanket toast ALL of their sandwiches, even when someone knows that they are not going to eat it right away, so if its toasted, the meal, when eaten, will be some sort of sad lukewarm.  
Every condiment was flavorless, and the entire thing was lukewarm and bland.  I don't think they added any salt when I asked. There were really no upsides to my sandwich. Or my experience. I wouldn't ever return to this store, especially since there is a GREAT Subway right down the road at Val Vista and Baseline.  Go there instead!"}
{"text":"This place is THE most bipolar place ever. One time I'll have great customer service, but more often than not I'll get shitty service. Like tonight, when the girl decided to ignore half of what I said. \"A line of chipotle\" and she throws it up and down the entire foot long. \"Just a few pickles\" and she grabbed a handful. Now granted, why am I bitching here and not there while she screws it up in front of me? I was so sick and just wanted a quick dinner at home before bed. Why was that so hard?!. I couldn't even enjoy it and ended up throwing half of it away. I can't say I won't be back since this subway is literally a walk away from my house but ugh this job is so easy and these kids just take advantage, do a shitty job, and are so rude. I'll never be nice and complacent there again. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"So tired with how Cheap they are, that they won't give napkins. My family of 4, eating dinner inside the restaurant-1 napkin. On top of that I spilled my drink on the table in front of the clerks everywhere. I'm sitting right in front of the order counter so they had to have seen it. They finished up with there 2 customers and not one of them came out to help clean up or offer some napkins, I had to keep going back and forth to the bathroom. And it's before 6:00, and they are always out of chocolate chip cookies. So tired of the crappy service, I mean they are making 10.00 an hour now, I deserved some customer service, right?!?! I won't be back."}
{"text":"There is a Subway in the Fry's shopping center nearby that is better. The bread here was still soggy, even after toasting."}
{"text":"Very rude girls that work in the front. I would rather get a sandwich from the liquor next door. If you're going to be rolling your eyes at customers then you might as well look for another job, just saying lol."}
{"text":"First ones in the shop on a Tuesday morning. 

I really enjoyed the flatbread breakfast sandwich. It was made to my liking. The server was friendly & friendly. 

I would defiantly stop again. The store was clean. We did arrive first in the morning. I do recommend this shop. I had no negative experience or issues."}
{"text":"It is Subway - chain fast food (although they don't call it that). While most of the subs are healthy, it is the stuff you start putting on them (extra mayo, cheese sauce, etc) that makes them bad for you.

This particular Subway, and the rating - the service here is FAST. Don't worry if you see a long line, you will speed right through it. All the ingredients are always fresh.

LOST STAR = The dining room is not always the cleanest. The few times I have ate in the dining area, I had to clean my own table before sitting down. They just need someone to come out from behind the counter every 15 min to wipe and broom... this would be a 5 star place."}

This particular Subway, and the rating - its the people, they just need to pay better attention. If you are the ONLY customer in the restaurant... then you are OK. Come in during a lunch or dinner rush... and you can only hope. Manager needs to do some good group and team training - if they would all just work together."}
{"text":"It's Subway

Better then most fast food places. The restraunt is always clean, and the service is always friendly. I enjoy the Artisan bread, with herbs/cheese, always fresh and crisp. Always a nice selection of choices.

Subway is better than most burger places. I like the option of adding tons of veg to the basic meats. The staff is friendly and the sandwiches are inexpensive.

Not bad for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Ah who doesn't love subway? It's fresh and convenient as always the veggie patty foot long never let's me down. Love their honey oat bread toasted with pepper jack cheese. Here's a photo. I put all my veggies with the exception of pickles :) make it more healthier by not adding any mayo just olive oil for your digestive system and sprinkle a little salt and pepper and whoala!"}
{"text":"Subways are pretty standard, and this place is alright on the whole in the sense it offers the standard sandwiches and has a decent amount of seating, but one thing that kills me is how every person that works there haphazardly throws the cheese on the bun.

Not only do they frequently use the non-standardized cheese placement, but half the time the cheese is just thrown randomly onto the bun with no effort for alignment with the bun at all! I never thought cheese placement would be such a sticking point for myself, but this needs to be said for maximum chese coverage and sandwich enjoyment. In efforts of educating people, and hopefully the owner of this location, I'll use simple images, thanks to the internet.
Good cheese placement = http://floodmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/6.jpg
Bad cheese placement = http://floodmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/5.jpg

See how each bite is entitled to equal cheese eating satisfaction in the first image? Well there is a reason that over 3-4 years ago all Subways standardized to this source: http://gawker.com/5551263/subway-finally-agrees-to-tessellate-cheese
So come on 3353 Bloor St W location - its time to become compliant and actually putting some effort into making a good sandwich!!!

{"text":"it's a Subway, much like any other. Food quality is standard issue, although I have to give this place a 2 because of the fact that lunches can be stupid sized lineups in part from the fact there is little to eat in the area, but also their staffs inability to execute timely sandwich making. The one time I had to watch a girl manhandle a meatball sub to the point of it practically exploding meatballs over the prep counter... It was ridiculous.

Will I stop eating here? No. But the fact I even felt like writing about it means its not just as good as any other Subway."}
{"text":"This Subway is convenient when you are in a hurry. It gets five stars for being in an awesome location and for being open 24 hours a day, everyday."}
{"text":"Subways are usually good and offer a healthy and nutritiou alternative to other fast food establishments. However, today I was disappointed with my visit.

Subway is usually fairly consistent and offer  reasonably priced quick meals.  The toppings are fresh and there is  a good variety of subs, toppings, soups, chips, and salads to choose from.

I usually order a 6\" sub, chips, and a drinks for  under $7.00.  Today, I decided to have a salad and to be honest I was disappointed. The Chopped Spicy Italian Salad just didn't taste good.  The lettuce were wet and the meats were stuck together at the bottom of the bowl.  It just wasn't very good.

The staff at Subway are  helpful, polite, and always make you feel welcomed. The price are very reasonable for what you get.  I guess you could do worse in a pinch."}
{"text":"This Subway was hopping the night my friend and I were here. It was before the Carly Rae Jepsen/Hot Chelle Rae concert downtown and a local high school dance, and the employees were bum rushed. We went at the perfect time, just before all the high school kids flocked in. Our service was fast and spot on. The food was excellent and right on the money."}
{"text":"This location is just down the street from where I work, so it's perfect for me to get in and out of in a jiffy.

Very friendly crew here. They work hard and fast to get customers their food in a timely manner. My food was so delicious and fresh! 

I know I will definitely be back there for lunch and since they also serve breakfast, I will try that as well."}
{"text":"I like coming to this location because their crew is always friendly and their service is fantastic! They are fast and get the sandwich made to your every specification and no special request is beneath this crew!"}
{"text":"I like this location because their employees are always friendly and their service is top notch! The store is always clean, usually busy, and they also have so much to offer as far as food selections and good deals.

Also, they have free wi-fi and ethernet, so if you have your laptop or smartphone, you can use their service. They also have tv so you can tune into whatever channel they have it on. 

I recommend this location whenever you're in this part of town."}
{"text":"Love Subway but the girls who work at this location skimp on the tuna & for that reason I gave this place 4 out of 5 stars. When I order tuna, by gosh I want what I pay for!"}
{"text":"The employees here are so nice! They make every sandwich perfect and do it with a smile! They try their hardest to make the customer happy. The owners are super nice. The place is clean, open, and very inviting! Best Subway ever."}
{"text":"We stopped here on cross-country trek. 

A) so much better than trying to go to all of the cheesy chains just down the road. 

B) 'Billy' created our entrees this evening. Here, Billy is not just a subway employee, he is a savant, a true sandwich artist. Our subs were made with meticulous attention to detail and in a timely manner. Thanks, 'Billy'.

That is not sarcasm, it was an awesome sandwich."}
{"text":"Spoke too soon with my first review.  If you plan on stopping by this location, make sure you pass on the drive-thru option.  My wife has stopped by on two separate occasions, using the drive-thru, only to come home and find that the protein was missing.  Kind of frustrating when you are picking up a specialty sub, spending more than usual, along with the fact that Subway is inherently an assembly line for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Subway is pretty hard to screw up, put some meat and veggies on fresh bread and you have a decent sub. I've only been to this location twice and I will avoid it after 2 bad experiences. The first time I tried it the bread was definitely not fresh. Much harder and drier than you would usually get at Subway. The second time they left the paper on cold cuts, pretty nasty surprise. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very quick service.. Lady was smiling and the food was great. She was very tight on putting the veggies on which is why I knocked it down to a 4 star.. When I ask for more veggies I want more."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE, STINGY and GOT SICK! 

This is a review for the subway in the underground food court at Yonge-Eglinton Centre.

I went to get an assorted cold cut combo (foot long) for lunch and it didn't hit it off from the beginning.  They were super stingy with the toppings (like 5 pieces of onion) and when it got to tomatoes, I literally got every single end piece.  They were all soggy when biting into them that I took it all out.  I also got super sick after causing stomach aches.  

I do not recommend this joint and you should just go to Freshii or Taco Bell in the same food court."}
{"text":"Love the fact that this location is next to the salon I frequent, but was disgusted with the staff in the manner my family & I were treated when we decided to opt out of having a sub, before we left we let them know we had changed our minds & thanked them for acknowledging us when walking in, but when walking out the door, the same person that greeted us said in a very loud voice\"I GUESS THEY DON'T LIKE US\" we were all very appalled and disgusted by that comment"}
{"text":"I enjoy this Subway location frequently. It's the closest restaurant from home, the workers are diligent, they get the job done and with a smile! I love the convenience of Subway. I can go there anytime, any day, and I know I can get something healthy and delicious."}
{"text":"Good enough for me. Again, a review for a place that's close to me, in Southern highlands. Always in and out pretty quick. Got a spicy italian footlong made just the way I like and toasted. It never disappoints. The bread is always fresh and cuts seem fresh.  I also like the meatball, but am a little sketchy of the chicken breasts they use, they don't look delicious to me so I stay away usually. Mostly melts, italians, ham and turkey, the occasional meatball.
The staff and service is always friendly, and every day I go in they say \"hi welcome to subway.\" That gets a little annoying but I'm sure it's store policy and to hear it every time makes me know they are trying. 
Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"While it is obvious that one doesn't go to Subway to nosh on gourmet sandwiches, there are certain things one expects from the fast food chain experience. Stuff like consistency. Or, perhaps, not running out of stuff like... cheese or, all breads other than White. But that happens here, and it happens often. 

Granted, it's constantly busy. Located on the 2nd floor of the Robarts Library at U of T, there's always a huge line of hungry students (like myself) who are looking to scarf down a mediocre sandwich before continuing a long study slog. But, really, there's gotta be some way they can do some planning to find out how much bread/cheese/toppings they need on a daily basis. Stuff is ALWAYS running out there by 5pm. 

Speaking of getting there by 5pm, if you're there past that time, take your food to go. It gets FILTHY in that food court by mid-afternoon. Wrappers, napkins, bottles EVERYWHERE: on the floor, on crumby tables, piling up around trash cans. Why the facilities don't have people there constantly is beyond me. 

Better yet, bring a sandwich from home. It'll taste better."}
{"text":"Godawful. I failed to monitor the employee (they change regularly as turnover is ASTOUNDING) and came home to unwrap the worst sandwich of my life. No American cheese or other seasonings were on the sandwich - despite me mentioning it TWICE. Perhaps I need to jump behind the counter and make the sandwich myself. At least this time I avoided the usual hassle at the cash register where they usually attempt to overcharge me."}
{"text":"Eat fresh? Not here. I had the tuna today and it was gross. Their salads are so plain."}
{"text":"Ordered online for fast pickup because I knew I had somewhere to be at 8pm. My order was supposed to be ready at 730. I got there at 735. Order wasn't made and they had a line out the door. Instead of making mine they wanted to me to go to the end of the line and wait. Isn't the point of taking the time to order ahead, to not wait in line?? I instead asked for a refund since I pre paid online. They argued with me for 10 mins that they couldn't give a refund. Finally the guy calls his manager and gives me cash because they couldn't figure out how to refund my card. It was 5 mins till 8 when I finally walked out of there with my cash and no subs. Will never go back."}
{"text":"This is my closest subway to home and they have always been good to me!  Bread is fresh, employees and eating areas clean and the cookies are good too :)"}
{"text":"This place sucks!
Was rudely told I would have to place a telephone order for 5 -6\" sandwiches during their busy time(there was a total 5 people in the store-two ahead of me & 3 sitting down eating)
It might have just been they were understaffed- I went to another subway a couple of miles away- they gladly took my order & had the sandwiches ready in minutes. I understand all subways are franchise, however this one truly sucks, rude & understaffed.
To the owner- train your employees properly or you'll loose a lot more business."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time in a long time. Kind of disappionted, condiments fell out of both halves of the footlong my son and i split and the gal behind the conter started giggling when she was corrected on the sandwhich after putting chicken on it. I think it will be a while before i return to this location again."}
{"text":"I've been too this subway before, and haven't really had a problem except for the manager. She's very snarky and has an unnecessary attitude. I waited in line for 10 minutes (Literal time and not making it up) over my 1/2 an hour lunch break. I get mobile alerts from subway and I just received a coupon for a 6\" sub. I waited all of this time and my coupon won't open on my phone. She told me it has to open for her to scan it. Well, every other time someone checks my coupons, all they have to do it look at it. Due to her attitude and unwillingness to let me use a coupon that wouldn't load correctly changed my perspective on this location. I'll drive out of my way to use a different subway. Also, she refused to take someone's coupon in front of me that wasn't tore out. Instead of sitting there and giving the girl attitude with neck and eye rolls and telling her to tear it out herself, people would have left the store sooner than later."}
{"text":"Always very clean. Always friendly staff. Even at 4am. Ron is the best sandwich maker out of any subway we have been to. He makes them as if he has OCD. They actually look like the sandwiches on the commercials. There is always a lot of parking available and the Tempe bike path goes right past this one. It is also a 24 hr subway"}
{"text":"I have stopped in to this subway several
Sunday's over the past few months.   Each time they were out of several key ingredients.   This last Sunday the 13th they were completely out of coins.  Standing in line I overheard several grumbly customers as they were told over and over that the items they wanted were not available.  The reason for the 3 stars that I awarded them was the charming smiling girl on the line named Hannah.  Wow what an asset this girl is even in the face of the store setting her up to fail by not having what she needs to make the guests happy this young lady continued to be calm and polite and friendly.  Her coworker Kaitlyn was also smiling and friendly and Subway it is your job to set them up for success.  Imagine what an awesome experience it would be to have these great kids wait on you and to be able to eat what you want not just what they have!!!"}
{"text":"There are another two Subways that are closer to my house, but I make it a point to come to this one instead. The staff are friendly, and some make very neat and tidy subs (I think that some of them are still new and the sandwich can be a little messy, so that's the reason for only 4 stars). I only come in about once a month, but certain employees recognize me and are friendly and open to small talk.

I really like that the prep surfaces and the overall store is clean. I seldom notice food debris on the prep surfaces or trash around the store. The other Subways within a few mile radius tend to be messy and never have prep surfaces as clean as this one's are, at least not when I've tried them."}
{"text":"This is that Subway where the ingredients are always fresh, the staff is courteous and efficient, the service is quick and you leave a happy customer. I tend to go only for breakfast where I can get a steak egg and cheese flatbread for $3.50. If you ask, they'll toast the veggies on the sandwich so it's a lot like eating a steak and cheese omelette. Of course you can choose ham or bacon or no meat at all! They are quite generous with the toppings too. And unlike some Subways they do carry mushrooms which always adds an extra topping to my order! The store is clean, they give you plenty of napkins, and are really good about accepting coupons. They often are running specials and there's even a promotion code for delivery! Really convenient if you live or work anywhere near the Metropolitan. Be sure not to leave the parking lot though without your car...they will tow!"}
{"text":"Subway is typically a good respectable place for a quick sandwich.  This location is as well.  Fast, cheap, and tasty.  Good location right off  of Higley and Pecos."}
{"text":"This subway is definitely one of the better ones I have been to! Staff have always been really nice and I've only ever waited in line once. The place is clean and well kept. It's a relatively healthy fast food place and I like to grab a sub after a long day or workout! I usually go for turkey breast on honey oat and it always tastes great for the price and for what it is!"}
{"text":"I love this subway! The staff is so friendly and they make sandwiches and salads soooo good. The staff makes me leave with a smile and a full healthy stomach!"}
{"text":"It's Subway.  Pretty much what I expected.  The folks I dealt with were pleasant and professional.  The sandwich was fine.  No complaints.  Nothing special, but no complaints."}
{"text":"This Subway location is ALWAYS out of sandwich stuff! I go here frequently as it's by my house but out of the last four trips, they've been out of what I wanted to order three separate times. Come on, your Subway, IT'S WHAT YOU DO!"}
{"text":"We have only be to this store for their breakfast offerings.  This was our first visit.  The breakfast sandwiches were fine.  Definitely better than a Mc-anything or similar offerings from other fast-food joints.  Price was reasonable.  There was only one person on the counter, so it was a bit slower than normal for a Subway.

If in need of a quick breakfast at a reasonable price, this is an ok place to come."}
{"text":"It's Subway.  Maybe it's just me, but they don't seem as good as they used to be.  They barely put any marinara on their chicken marinara, and the bread seems to turn into a doughy mess after just a few minutes.  It looks OK when they cut it and put the stuff on it, but just in the time it took to get to the table it had collapsed from a full, airy bread to a wad of dough.  I'm not sure the toasting helped at all.

As restaurants go, they suck.  As sub shops go, they are really below average.  I'd go here before going to McDonald's or Burger King.  But that's about all I can say.

If you have other options, I suggest taking them.  If not, it beats McYucks."}
{"text":"I'm in town for a convention and decided to grab a Sub to take back to the hotel room.  This Subway has a great location in the Arizona Center.  It was not very busy.  The staff was friendly and neat. 

I was disappointed when I got back to the room to eat only to discover that the bread either old or left in the microwave to long."}
{"text":"To me, most Subway restaurants come pretty standard. The bread is usually fresh, as well as the vegetables, and the customer service is pretty good: You ask for what you want on your sandwich/salad/wrap and you receive without any drama about it. But at this specific location, that was NOT the case in my experience. 

My family and I decided we wanted Subway for dinner and came to this location. I went in alone and ordered for everyone, which came to about one salad and three sandwiches. I initially told the girl working all that I needed made when I walked in and apparently this was a HUGE order and overwhelmingly annoying amount of food for her to make. Mind you, the store was completely dead beside myself being in there so it wasn't like I was making this 'huge' order while a line of people built up behind me.

She complained pretty much the whole time, rolling her eyes, making jokes about my order to the other employee there with her, and sighed \"seriously?\" by the time I got to the last item I needed to be made. Never have I ever been made to feel so guilty about a fast food order in my life.

Of course I wanted to walk out of there the moment she expressed her annoyance. I told her that I could go somewhere else if my order was a such a problem for her based on the way she was responding. She said no \"it's fine\" and with one more eye roll and a sigh from her I was out the door.  

After the experience, I wanted to report her, but she had no name badge on and the name on the receipt was a male's so eventually I just let it go. Needless to say I'll never be back to this Subway again."}
{"text":"Lucky even getting one star. Staff was friendly. Always thought subway was stingy on the meat, but this time was ridiculous ! Ordered a foot long ham an turkey she layed out 2 slices of turkey on one on each side then preceded to fold up 2 slices of ham for each side. Are you kidding me three slices of meat per 6 in ended up ordering double meat. Also got bacon one slice per side. Subway needs to step up their game. Jersey mikes and Jimmy Johns will be the only place getting our business from now on"}
{"text":"Owned and run by half wits. I gave it another shot after a year. I won't again. Providence should have worthy establishments only. This Subway should be replaced with something else."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible food. But what makes this subway worse then all the others is that whenever I go in the same manager ALWAYS hits on me and makes it very comfortable for me to even go in there. Very unprofessional and almost always dirty. Only have one star because 0 wasn't an option."}
{"text":"I don't know what the lady was doing in the back room at 8pm on a Friday night, but it wasn't waiting behind the front counter for customers. Me and another dude waited a good few minutes, staring at one another before our sammich maker came out. When she did, she did fine. It's Subway, after all, and slapping food into bread ain't all that hard."}
{"text":"I will only get my sandwiches at THIS location.  Customer service has never been an issue here. I've tried other Subways out here and they ALL have awful service.  It's clean in here, they wash their hands before making the food and veggies are fresh."}
{"text":"Tia did a fantastic job, made a beautiful Turkey sandwich on honey oat, made me feel very welcome when I walked in and has great customer service skills!! High five TIA!"}
{"text":"Good service. 
One time they were out of all breads except for white and flatbread but that was early in the morning.
Much more consistent than the one on McDowell Rd. Ingredients are fresher and the tuna actually tastes like it's supposed to at this location."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Found stink bug in my food. Was offered a gift card to go back?  No thanks. Not going back. There are a lot of Subways out there, you should go find another one."}
{"text":"Food was meh, but close to par for what one expects from subway.

The service was awful though. The cashier basically made me ring up myself. One of the employees began ranting at the manager about half way through my lunch. He dropped f-bombs and others several times in a loud voice. Didn't really bother me much, but if I had a kid there I would have been pissed. The manager or whoever he was ranting at did nothing to calm the employee down or redirect and about 5 mins after the initial outburst it started up again. In general the employees seemed very unhappy to work there and didn't care about the customers."}
{"text":"So I heard this was the best subway in the city by my friend so I decided to stop by with him for lunch. And was it awesome! Let's just say their veggies are the freshest and they loaded me up on the meat. I can honestly say, I was full after just one sandwich. I've never felt full when I ate at subway, and now I can say that I have!

I'll come back here if I'm near and craving for a sub."}
{"text":"This subway's already down hill. They have less options (no silantro or Swiss cheese). And  that is not all, they charge for refills, unlike other subway's or other sub places. And also their meat has a weird taste. But my sub was okay, but a bit dry."}
{"text":"I probably should've read the reviews prior to coming to this sorry ass subway. I really don't even eat subway all like that but I was on a time crunch and this was the only thing that seemed appealing at the time and with the limited amount of places to eat in the area! I thought the whole $5 footlong thing was still happening but apparently that's been done for a while! Just goes to show how much o eat at subway right? Anyways I walk in no employees visible except for in the back there was a teenage girl sitting on the counter and another boy in the back with her? Hmm.. Anyways so they waited about 1 minute to come out and greet me the proceeded to ask for my order! I inquired about the $5 footlong and she pointed up and the menu and said no but we do have the lunch deal for $5 which included a 6 inch sub, a drink and a cookie! Whoohoo **rolls eyes** I opted for the tuna sandwich and boy oh boy they are super stingy on the amount they decide to put on your sandwich because those measly little scoops of tuna and all that bread was a disaster! I just thought to myself whatever it's $5 I'm hungry no time to complain I gotta get going! When I went to get the ice tea there was none and I proceeded to ask \" you guys don't have anymore ice tea\" she responded nope but if you want some then I can make you some? Are you kidding so that lets me know that the entire time it was sitting there empty they knew about it and decided to not make any more until a customer asked? No thanks! I can't see them staying in business too much long with these kids they have working who act like they hate their jobs! I won't return..."}
{"text":"Subway is usually a great place to go for a relatively healthy meal on the go. They offer nice lean sandwiches at a great price. They, in my opinion, have been the pioneers of creating a healthy menu. If you think about it after Jared Fogel attributed much of his weight loss to Subway, EVERYTHING changed. They began shouting out low fat sandwiches, low calorie additives, as well as offering apples as an alternative to chips.

It gives me comfort to know that there's a place out there where I won't feel completely guilty after eating there.

Being a franchise, the inside of almost every Subway looks identical, give or take a couple of layout differences. So, the only discernible variable is the service. 

I've been to this particular location a couple of times, mostly due to the \"healthy\" and \"time\" factors...that, and it's righty by my house. I have yet to receive consistent service here. 

The first time my family and I stopped at this location, the restaurant was a complete disaster. The store wasn't a couple of hours away from closing, yet all of the chairs were on the tables, and the floor was soaking wet from just being mopped. Strangely, even though the place had just been \"cleaned\", there was still a smell that was very off-putting. But, the service was actually decent.

The last time we went, the place was at least put together again. But, that same off-putting smell was still there. And to top it all off, the service was SUPER slow! I don't know that I've ever seen it take that long to make three sandwiches. I don't even know that I have the words to describe it...I mean, \"slothful\"...but even that doesn't really cut it.

The long of the short of it is this...if you're looking for a sandwich and you're in this area, consult your Yelp. There are MUCH better alternatives."}

{"text":"(I made a mistake and posted this to another location, caught this as I was writing a followup, so I erased my original review, reposting it here, and am posting a followup, so sorry if it looks a bit weird. I promise I'll pay closer attention going forward!)


How long has it been since I've felt more than \"meh\" about a Subway? Cant remember, there was one in Gilbert that was OK, but other than that, my experience with them as a chain has been so-so and in Arizona mostly wretched. With one, \"Worst in Class\" experience mixed in.

But after a long day of having my life saved at Mayo Clinic, I was a tad peckish, and we decided on a sandwich. Driving through Fountain Hills we decided that giving Subway there would be a reasonable gamble.  
This location w as a complete delight.

CLEAN
SUPER CLEAN!
Nice! I was greeted when I walked in, and the one women working behind the counter apologized and said she would be with me as soon as her current customer was finished.

As I waited, I looked at the food in the bins behind the glass and .. they were all appetizing looking! This was a first in a decade or more for me! Nice, neat, this is a store that is run by someone with personal pride.

When my turn came, my wife ordered a steak & cheese w/extra meat, and I went for a Spicy Italian extra meat and cheese. (Its a heck of a value, and for us, 2-3 meals per sandwich)

My wife was happy with her food, I was struck by things that are missing everywhere else. 
I never want to be a hassle so don't ask for it, but this woman separated the slices of meat on my sandwich, which makes a big difference in the texture of the sandwich, and nobody does.

All this, and the store was only staffed with one person is astounding. Sadly, labor costs are eternal, no matter the business.

The toppings were crisp, and the service was spot on perfect, the place, immaculate.. yes, it's a Subway, but within the world of Subways.. it's Iron Chef Subway.
And I respect that.

If I get a hunger for it again, there is only one Subway that will do, I live 2 blocks from the worst sandwich shop we have ever eaten at which also happens to be a Subway. (and after a respectful letter of feedback , we never heard back from the owner) And to get to this one, we drive by countless subways and other places. But nothing beats the taste that comes from a restaurant run with personal pride, and a real aim towards excellence.

As I reread this it sounds impossible, and like I'm going on to long about it, but please believe me, its because my expectations and experiences have been so extremely low about this chain, I would always have chosen McDonald's or some drive through  over Subway based on Arizona experiences! This location makes a value oriented sandwich the way it should be. 

I love a great sandwich, and will pay a pretty penny for one, Does this take the place of Duck and Decanter? 

Lets be real, no way, but, for a $5 Italian Spicy Sub? 
This Subway can be proud, Has ample parking, at least two nice staff folks (one lady was there working, another was just coming on)
And even though I believed everything to be prefab, the ingredients were as fresh as could be, 
On recommendation, I tried spinach instead of lettuce on my sub and it really was a good flavor that worked very well."}
{"text":"OK, it's a Subway, you know what to expect, if you want a higher end sandwich there are other higher priced options within a stones throw of this location. 

I'm just giving it 4 stars on those expectations. And the fact that I used to avoid this specific location, but it has improved a great deal.

The employees have consistently been nice over the last 3 visits (over a few months) 
clean location and very quick.
Even going so far as to recommend I order another sub but have it dressed differently in order to save money on my order! Losing money on one sale, but making it up in repeat visits.
The bread situation as described by others seems to have improved, so they usually have the loafs that I want, which is a real perk.
Also the food tastes fresh, which was a problem before, perhaps they used to over prep things and store them to long? Either way, things taste better now, the price is right, and the folks are nice.


For decent cheap fastish food that's not designed to impress, it's a win.(I call it fastish because fast food had a drive through IMHO)

There is better to be had in the area, but not for the price, and especially if you like a lot of things on your sammy this is a great choice"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with other reviews. This particular restaurant offers very poor service and is quite stingy with the items they place on sandwiches. I actually spoke with a person who identified himself as a manager, and I am appalled, to say the least, regarding his response. He was quite belligerent, and displayed zero concern with the fact that a new customer would not be returning to this store. Every employee in the store looked miserable. It is apparent why. There is a subway on highway 21 in Fort Mill that offers excellent service, and they are extremely generous with their portions. They are quite friendly and efficient. I highly suggest visiting that store!"}
{"text":"Subway is Subway, but this one was special.  I was in and out in 4 min for take out.  They mean business.   Love it.  And -- made a damn good sandwich too.  You might win my business back from Mr. Sub!!"}
{"text":"I had a complaint and the owner just called me to revise it.  They're replacing my meal. 

Great customer service Niles.   Thank you."}
{"text":"I'm a big subway fan and generally I give average ratings for Subway restaurants.  I felt this place deserves an extra star because of how they packed almost all the toppings in for me.  

But really, the consistency is almost the same wherever you go.  For the price you pay ... you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite subway I have been to in my life! I have been all over the country and even had subway internationally during my time serving in Korea and this specific location is by far my favorite. I have always enjoyed my experience with subway as I have been eating there for over 20 years but the people here are what make it this place the best. Not only do they care about the art of sandwichery (making a sandwich the best it can be) but they are consistently friendly and helpful. After so many years of ordering my tomatoes last so I could get the salt and pepper on just before they closed the sandwich I find out tonight from my sandwich artist that ordering the tomato last has been making my bun soggy! After all this time I learn a new life hack for ordering my sub! Great location!"}
{"text":"Store owner scammed me when using a coupon. Charged full price and refused to give me receipt, when asked for the receipt I showed him tge obvious and accepted to refund me, but it's clear that he does this to more customers. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Segway is better than Subway. At least you can move around on a Segway. You eat too much Subway you won't be moving much.

Seriously though it's not healthy stuff. The young man serving us here was perfectly nice, but I specifically didn't order anything because the food never is. We got 2 sandwiches between 4 of us, and if I can recall, 3 of us thought it was crap. But then I always think it's crap. One was a Ham Sub, the other was Chicken Teriyaki. Which tastes like sugary syrup, but then the bread tastes like sugar too. I can't with Subway.

So much good food in Pittsburgh. Can't believe that people still eat here. But hey, it's convenient. And that was our excuse too. I enjoyed my Orange Julius and some coffee from Gloria Jeans a lot more. And I don't even like Orange Juice - or drink coffee!"}
{"text":"This place open in the same location where Quiznos use to be. They're pretty quick to service you."}
{"text":"Its a standard Subway. Unfortunately some employees speak barely english, which makes ordering or asking questions extremly hard. Now, English is my second language too, but at least I able to communicate pretty good.... One lady tends to be rather rude, and ignores people and/or their questions. She sighs a lot when you ask her if she would please (Yes we always say please and thank you!) put more dressing on the sandwich or whatever.
Literally, she sigh's! 
Maybe i would be too if I had to work at Subway and all those americans come in and order in english but I dont speak nor do I understand english. 

How rude of us to order in english!"}
{"text":"I got the tuna on honey oat with veggies. Everything was fresh, and the tuna salad had the right amount of mayo, imo. Not too much like at some locations! I have ordered this particular sandwich many times, and this was a perfect example of why. It's not amazing, but it's pretty good, especially for a quick, inexpensive, and healthier lunch.

The store was clean, the employees were friendly, and this is a convenient location for me. I also liked that there is a designated handicap table. I actually go to a lot of Subways, and I must say this was rare to find. I would come back."}
{"text":"Well this subway has gotten some pretty atrocious reviews. I have always had good experiences at this subway. My boyfriend lives right across the street at the apartment complex so getting some late night \"healthy food\" is sometimes a little bit tricky being that were in the south part of Las Vegas. Luckily this subway is open 24 hours a day so late night food is a perfect sometimes. I've noticed that a lot of people aren't very kind to the subway sandwich artists. I've actually noticed that many people aren't very nice to people who serve them. I always try to do a good job at saying hello and asking the person who is serving me how their day is going and if they've been busy or not. Because of this I feel like I get better service and have better experiences because I'm kind to people.

I give it a solid 4 stars because sometimes the bread isn't as fresh as it could be but it's a really decent subway shop and the sandwich artists there are good folks. If you stop and ask them how their days are going then you'll probably be getting a pretty awesome sandwich with some pretty awesome service."}
{"text":"Friendly service. The food looks fresh and tasty. They get you in and out quite quickly. Clean establishment.  They also have a few tables to sit at or you can carry it out. They also cater."}
{"text":"Never again. The service was terrible and the toppings on what I think was a six inch roasted chicken sub had to scrapped off because they tasted funny. I should have bought the egg sandwich from the vending machine in the back of the bathroom at the local truck stop ."}
{"text":"This subway is a standard representation of the sandwich chain. Often times I come late at night when all else is closed. At that time there is usually just one person on staff. For those reasons I don't expect a lot, and that seems to be the attitude of the shop as well.

I normally get my sandwich built fairly quick and the menu and prices are reasonable. I don't like that the parking lot is fairly dark at night leaving it feeling somewhat unsafe in the later hours.

In my last visit , after I was standing in line to order, a food supply truck pulled up to deliver his load to the Subway. He came in the store and asked me to move my vehicle from the customer parking spot to around the corner. It seemed weird that they expected customers to park elsewhere to clear the front door entrance area so they could deliver their supplies instead of having a freight entrance. But I went outside and moved my van to the north parking lot area. Not sure why the supplier couldn't have backed their trailer up to that area and left the front area alone. When I returned back to the inside of the store , I had lost my place in line. I was a bit frustrated and the Subway employee recognized that and offered to serve me next. I appreciated that, but I was tired and just decided to leave. 

I think the Subway could use a bit more staff on the late shift and some better lighting in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Who gives a Subway a 5 star review? I do!! Rick from NC is currently visiting and we met up for a cheap lunch and I raved about the limited trial of the pretzel roll! Initially we were at the one near my place, but they no longer are serving it!!! Say what?!?!?! Patty the Manager there on Happy Valley Road was awesome enough to inform us that she believed this location still had them and 15 left! Thanks to her recommendation and informing me that they served it from my previous visit I have loved it! She also made the call in for us and was confirmed they have them!

Upon arrival at this Subway we were immediately greeted, it is very clean, friendly and the Manger, Pete was super cool! He was like a good ol' friend that you've grown up with. He gave us the low down on the pretzel roll and they don't know if it will be returning or not and mentioned another state premiered the gluten-free rolls. Say what?!?! He didn't understand why it was so exclusive either. The music that is playing here is fantastic with classic rock and we were relayed it's \"Subway satellite\"! Say what?!?!?! WILD! Manager Pete is an excellent Manager along with Patty at the other location. He gave us an extra cookie and also offered me another bag of chips, if I didn't like the other bag I inquired about that I had never tried. How sweet and cool is that?  

I also appreciate the employees here. They were pleasant and for the first time a Subway had someone come around to clean our table off and asked if she could discard our trash. They also provide oval sized plastic baskets while dining in to place your sandwich, chips and whatever in it. This is a first I have seen and a nice touch. They also have a rewards program for customers who check-in during your visit on their Samsung tablet by just punching in your phone number to build up points for Subway deals. My next visit here I'll receive 10% off and one can obtain deals of buy one get the other half off or buy one, get one. Pretty sweet!  Pete mentioned the Owner at his location owns 40 locations and that they have a good network and great employees. I really enjoyed a lot of the concepts that this place has and it's apparent that whomever the owner is, he/she knows how to be successful and retain great and happy employees. 

*How can we get the pretzel rolls indefinitely at all locations or my local areas?* COME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now this will be funny if I get an ROTD for Subway? I know right?!?! :)

THANK YOU Pete and Patty! And THANK YOU Rick for the lunch!"}
{"text":"Here at 8:25, they say the open at 8 on the sign, employees inside not opening the doors? Bet the owner of the business loves that idea....  Been there other times and they have done a good job"}
{"text":"Have been coming the last couple weeks about 3 days a week but every once in awhile before that. Noticed how hot it was in the store, figured it was the fresh bread being baked in the oven. Came back in a few more times to notice the same thing... Asked the young lady who was helping me why it was so hot? She responded with \"Yeah, the A/C has been broken for the last week or so and the owner tried fixing it but it's still broken\" well that makes sense since I was sweating bullets the week before and again today. Told her how crummy for her that she has to work in that heat and she just nodded... Well I went to the restroom and it was really cool and nice (minus the two small black bugs on the floor and empty hand towels)... Noticed a second thermostat on the wall towards the back of the restaurant and realized there was 2 A/C thermostats... So while the workers are good in the back of the store the customers in the front are sweating bullets and the owner doesn't want to fix since the back is working for his employees. You lost me as a customer and I'll be letting everyone know. Just horrible"}
{"text":"Diet Coke - This business is not closed I eat here all the time. They normally do a great job. Not sure why it is marked the way it is. I am literally eating here right now"}
{"text":"I'm coming to the rescue of these guys.  I've eaten here a bunch because it is on the way from my home to the freeway. Service has been good and the people have been nice.  They don't deserve to sit there with 1 star.  Not sure what ad Kevin was talking about.  the important things about a subway if you ask me are consistent product, quick service, clean, AC, and the pop working.  This place is fine.  There is a subway down towards Queen Creek that I couldn't say that about, but I was only there once so I won't throw them under the bus.  I've eaten at this Subway maybe a dozen times and it is exactly what you would expect."}
{"text":"Good food but the service isn't very well. It depends which location you go to. Good locations in Murrysville and you probably won't wait very long if you go in."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times as it's right across the street from where I live.

This is like most other Subways. Great sandwiches!

This place has never been very busy. Always clean.

Best of all it's open 24 hours a day!"}
{"text":"This subway is the most convenient location wise for me but I won't be coming here anymore. I understand that the bread could sometimes get a little hard but every time I go it is. I have worked at a subway so I know this means the workers don't give a crap. You can tell when you walk in to anytime after 7 pm. One time I went here on a work break and the store was flat out closed around 7 pm. A sign was on the store saying be back soon. -_-"}
{"text":"Never in my wildest of Yelping dreams did I imagine that I'd be giving Subway a 3 star review. For the most part, I'm just not a fan of the chain as a whole. But this particular location is different...and having lived just around the corner from here for about 3 years now, I've been here enough to say this one sets itself apart from any other one I've been too.

It is located in the Albertsons shopping center off of Farm & Durango just a few doors down from Starbucks. While fairly small like most Subway locations, this is easily one of the cleanest and most well-kept fast food restaurants. Every time we've been here, the place is spotless both in the dining area and behind the counter. All the separate areas for things like chips and sodas are well organized. Just seconds after someone leaves, they are coming through to wipe up and straighten everything up. It's really a very well run spot and honestly, that's just nice to see.

Now, as far as the food goes...it's still a Subway. Most of the time the sandwiches are a major hit and miss and don't deserve but 2 stars on their own. Sometimes the bread is obviously old, sometimes the ingredients have clearly been sitting out for a while and sometimes something just doesn't taste right. But every now and then you can a pretty decent sandwich here, and they're fairly cheap too. Most 6\" subs can be had for under $5 and I usually get the Spicy Italian with double meat ($1.50 extra) that comes out to $5.50. Not that I'm anywhere near worried about watching what I eat, even though I should be, but I feel better about spending six bucks on this opposed to a greasy burger or burrito. Sure, I love those things a lot more, but a sandwich really hits the spot sometime. Plus I'm a huge fan of putting cucumbers on my sandwich and that is strangely one of my biggest reasons for coming here over other sandwiches chains in the area. I also like the different sauces they offer, including the Creamy Sriracha sauce that I think is really tasty. 

But what really makes us frequent this Subway, is the staff. They move really quick and we've never had to wait more than a couple minutes. Pretty much every single employee we've dealt with has been great, and one of the managers in particular is just straight up a nice dude. They're always extremely friendly and not once have we been rushed or gotten attitude like you expect from fast food chains. Even during a summer visit where their AC was out, these guys were smiling and going about their job without a hitch. In this Vegas heat, that's a feat all on its own. 

There's no argument that much, much better sandwiches can be found in Las Vegas, even if you're just looking at chains. But Subway has cheap ones that can be decent, and our family of 3 can easily eat and be full for well under $20. And with service that's all but unheard of in fast food, we will definitely continue to be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Why does this place have low stars?? The service was phenomenal! My sandwich is amazing and looks better than the picture AND the girls working were super nice! There was no line on a Sunday around lunch time. Seriously, this needs to be my go-to Subway! I wouldn't mind the longer drive out here just for the service at this location. The northwest location subways are the best!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this subway has such negative reviews. Every time I've come here, they have been SUPER nice. The service is amazing and my sandwich turns out picture perfect. Even when I came in at like 1 AM and the computers went down, the guy working was still great. This is my favorite subway in Vegas. I'm lucky this one is by my house."}
{"text":"The staff are really friendly and efficient. When you ask for extra toppings they give you a total of four olive slices and barely any other toppings"}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss with this location depending on who is working. Today was a win! Excellent and fast service, including a very tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"I have to give a big shout out to my local Subway restaurant! I wish I had paid attention to the names of the two guys working...Of course the sandwiches were delicious as usual. But today, my walking buddyCherie AND my 90lb German Shepherd decided to walk to Subway for lunch. Well, they have no outdoor seating at this location, so we thought we would just take turns outside with Koda (my dog) and maybe eat as we walked. No--one of the guys offered to physically move a table and chairs outside so that we could sit outside with the dog. They even gave me a container of drinking water for Koda!
Amazing customer service guys!! Kudos!!
It was such a nice treat!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a breakfast sandwich which is normally $3.25 at every other subway I have visited. Here it was $6. Absolutely insane. The sand which was fine-nothing special (is it ever at subway?)  and the staff were kinda rude when I asked why the price was so much more vs everywhere else."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS SUBWAY!!! I went here to get lunch the other day and was blown away by the promptness and courtesy of the staff. CHRIS is a master of the sub craft arts. This dude's sandwich game was tight as hell. I'm talking crazy quickness and pinpoint accuracy with the mustard. Lettuce? No, LET ME be amazed. Way to take pride in your job sir! Also the bathrooms were exceptionally clean. Way to be awesome CHRIS. YOU SIR, are a meaty cheesy superstar!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a fair amount of time and I always get the same thing (Ham with Swiss toasted on white with mayo, I'm a plain guy) and that's just fine with me! But today I mosied my way in and an employee I've never met before named Johnny tried to force me to eat a disgrace of a Ruben. I don't like to use foul language as that's not how my momma raised me! But seriously F***k Johnny. Won't be returning here until numb nuts is gone. Yours truly, Terry! :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to buy a sandwich, my friend ordered a foot long and we both shared, i went to the washroom for a minute and i hear yelling, i come outside and see the worker yelling at my friend for apparently ordering another sandwich the lady working there was mopping the floor 3 hours before closing hours so like at 6, she said that it wasn't fair that she had to make another sandwich when she asked my friend if that was it. me and my friend were ordering a sub we never had before, so we didn't know what to expect, but my friend enjoyed it and wanted another one, is that so wrong? as i said previously she then complained that she had to make another sandwich and that she was busy mopping (3 hours before closing time!). In the end we got the sandwich then left immediately afterwards, literally seconds before we were about to leave another customer walked in, so it wouldn't have mattered if we even ordered or not. Not going back."}
{"text":"Came in today around 4:50 pm and theres was 2 guys here, the taller one served me and he was SOOOOO nice! both guys are nice.. the tall guy just had great customer service. please let those guys get acknowledged for their customer service. the shorter one greeted me as soon as i came in and the taller one was super nice and talkative. they both washed their hands and the place is very clean. perfect place to eat."}
{"text":"Very clean subway. As for some of the people working there, they could probably use some work. They assume you have been to subway before and know exactly what the options are so they just asked, \"What would you like?\". Did not ask if I wanted any cheese or what type of cheese. Somehow remembered to offer the sandwich toasted. 

\"Sandwich artists\" were gossiping about something I would really rather not hear about as my sandwich was toasted.

As per usual, lack of vegetables, I just always feel like I'm running thru subway with my woes. You already know. Never liberally applied veggies, I am so tired to asking for \"extra lettuce\", when it isn't really extra it's just the normal amount you would ask for. 

Bathroom is clean and useable. Cleanliness at this location is very respectable."}
{"text":"So came here to get a sub using the T-mobile Tuesdays offer and they denied me. If anything this subway next to CCAC should honor this as many students including me would come here more often."}
{"text":"Came in around 9 o'clock on a Monday night. Place was clean and well kept. Customer service was good but the way Filipe, made my sandwich, I had to give them a yelp. We've all had that subway sandwich that looks like shit and nothing close to the commercial.Glad I bought a footlong because the other half is on display in my living room. Keep up the great work fellas!"}
{"text":"Let me say it, I Love subway...not this one. Sadly its the closest one to my apt. Last night though, made me wonder just a bit.  Went with a friend to get a sub. I wasn't hungry, thank Jebus! My friend ordered his sub and when we got to the counter the one employee says to the other: \"what's that crawling on the floor\" under his breath. My friend and I pretended not to hear as we walk out...I so much wanted to turn around and hear what it was...but I feared I would loose my love for Subway... *sigh* I hope it was just...cricket or something from outside. My friend said the food was great though... I mean their store front was clean, everything looked fresh and tasty...just...can't stop thinking about the thing crawling on the floor..."}
{"text":"Amazing place love that its open 24 hours for my late night grub. Also the employees there dont skimp you on the items you want on your sandwich."}
{"text":"Surrounded by buffets in Las Vegas and I end up at Subway?? I needed something to eat while on lunch break at a conference at the Imperial Palace next door, so I headed over to O'Shea's Casino. Luckily I found the place even before I saw it - you know, that \"subway\" smell. I can't describe the subway smell...the bread? the toppings? Anyhoo, you know you found it when you smell them.

The prices were no more pricier than the Subways back home in Honolulu and the service was fast. 

The seating at this particular Subway was dismal at lunch-time."}
{"text":"Walked in, walked right out. The guy had closed everything up half hour before store hours posted, was cleaning and clearly pissed we walked in. We are currently eating at Culver's where we decided to go across town. Were greeted kindly by not one but two members. Choose the face of your store wisely, consumers have a choice"}
{"text":"I stopped into this Subway with a really empty stomach recently. 
It's kind of hidden away, so you have to look for it carefully or you'd miss it. Probably not the best location if you're wanting customers.

I made advantage of their promotion where you could get two footlongs (after 7pm or something) for $5. Seemed like a good deal to me, I could always just keep the second sandwich in my fridge for later.

The service was speedy (wasn't terribly busy either), and I was out of there with my two sandwiched in no time. I got a subway club and aa turkey, ham and swiss footlong, and spent all afternoon and evening eating them.
Delicious"}
{"text":"I really like this Subway. I know at times it may seem like \"seen one subway, seen 'em all\", but I consider myself to be somewhat of a Subway connoisseur since I've eaten at Subway more times and more locations that I can count. This one really stands out. 

Reasons: Super duper clean, friendly staff, nice decorative touches, and that yummy strawberry lemonade in the soda fountain. What more could you want in a Subway? 

I'll be here again!"}
{"text":"Great location, always kept clean. Avocado BLT - you can't beat it. This location rock the cookies."}
{"text":"The worse subway in Montréal! J'y suis aller aujourd'hui lundi 11 janvier a 11h50. Le vendeur était impolis ! Il parler mal, aucune gentillesse, insolant. Une plainte a était fait au ressource humaine de Subway Québec ! Et bien-sûr le sandwich bâcler et pas bien ragoûtant !!! Je vais chez Subway rarement pour dépanner quand j'ai pas le temps de luncher. Bref éviter Subway saint Laurent !"}
{"text":"After Punk Rock Bowling we headed straight to get a sandwich. Totally surprised to see a fully stocked and clean food bar. This review is for Vicki, you were fast accurate and friendly thanks so much for the after party foot longs they were delicious."}
{"text":"I come here for the soup  of the day. I really enjoy the broccoli and cheddar. And the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Ok...so my first review of this place, if I had my way the health inspector would have closed it and subway would have needed to send me a check for damages for my personal distress.

Wheres Johnny Cochran when ya need him!  

This is kind of what happened to this location, they closed down and remodeled, I would have to say that since the remodel, this place has kind of cleaned up a bit, and they do have some pretty good employees, there is one fat girl that works there now that is a bit rude still, like she hates life and everybody in it because she is overweight, but for the most part the rest of the staff is pretty good. The food is how can you say, what you would expect, it's a sandwich buffet with some one else making the sandwich, I mean I could probably never give this place 5 stars, but as far as fast food places go this place is up to par."}
{"text":"Came in here tonight to grab some dinner, seemed like the healthiest option at the moment, Just got a sandwich to go and the place was pretty much empty, but what I saw was clean. And William the sandwich artist was pretty friendly even though he did forget a few items that were suppose to go on my Turkey bacon guacamole sub in the process of making it. He did hook it up thou after the fact, and made sure to go out of his way to get it right. 
All in all a good experience with the staff and the sandwich was good."}
{"text":"The sandwich was adequate if uninspired ... pretty much what you expect from a Subway.  This was my first visit to one of these chain stores in several years, and will likely be my last for the foreseeable future.  Even amongst chain sandwich shops, there are so many better options available.

I was waiting for a connecting flight and was wanting something that involved fresh produce (hadn't seen much of that during my trip), and this was the best option available.  I'm not certain if the staff were being rude, or simply incompetent, but it took forever to both order my food and receive it.  There are many other food options at McCarran Int'l Airport, so I'd recommend skipping this one."}
{"text":"I will never go back to the subway. I am so glad that I was standing behind someone in line so I had the ability to see how they were treated and leave before I spent my money there. The girl in front of me asked the person helping us to use a different knife because she had a severe allergy to avocado, and you would have thought that she was asking the worker to do a backflip... Completely rude and unnecessary. This all happened around 2 PM on Friday, March 13. I really hope that this girl gets fired because it was completely uncalled for."}
{"text":"I will never go into this place again. I've live in the neighborhood for the past 8-9 years. I'll admit I've had past problems with them and over looked until recently motivated to place a review. Workers here are the most unfriendly skimpy shady peeps I've ever come across. They took my receipt a couple times and when I ask for one they do a reprint bc they don't want to give you the coupons that print out. Plus I question their pricing as there has been times where it doesn't add up?! I've had them refund me bc they are shady. After that I would scarcely come in only if I had a coupon bc honestly they make the worse subs so there is no way I'm coming in and paying full price like I would at jimmy johns, sidewinders, or lees sandwiches. It's not worth it!! Well I went in with the txt coupon for signing up to get a free 6inch with a purchase of a drink. Wanted to get chips and cookies too. Well I get to check out and she was like no. The conversation with her broken English just left me pissed off. It's printed on my last receipt stating \"Arizona locations\"... Am I not in Arizona? I signed up now give me my free turkey sub! No, no.. We don't do that.. So you made a sub and now your going to throw it away and lose a sale for the other stuff I'm going to buy.. Makes no sense. Poor business and ethically wrong. I just drove down another mile and used it no problem. Hate is a strong word- but this girl seriously needs an adjustment and reality check!"}
{"text":"This location is generally okay except for one employee who I believe is related to the owner, but unfortunately, her bizarre behavior and customer service brings down the establishment. If you don't have to deal with her, it's a generally positive experience."}
{"text":"You would think the prices would be \"airport prices\" but it is the same as anywhere else. Conveniently located inside the hotel. Very generous with their toppings. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is your typical Subway.  However, its inside Casino Royale as part of their food court.  As a result, it costs about twice as much as a normal subway.

Outside of the cost and the hours, 24/7, it is your normal Subway.  I was watching what I ate when I was last in Vegas for work and actually ate here four times.  Every time was solid."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Went in there yesterday morning to get a sun for lunch. Asked the guy to put my toppings in a salad bowl for me so everything wouldn't get soggy.  The guy there told me no because it's part of my inventory and I'll have to charge you for a salad. Never again. There are way better sandwich places than this that would charge me for a plastic bowl."}
{"text":"Since the new ownership/ management came in and cleaned house, it is by far the worst subway I've ever been to in my life. They hardly fill the sub with ingredients and when you ask more a little more they say they will have to charge extra. I only go there if I have no other option and it's a shame because it's very close to my work."}
{"text":"The kids behind the counter are always nice - they always laugh and joke and offer suggestions. The restaurant is clean, brightly lit, and like the rest of the shops at Park Road Shopping Center, deep as a bowling alley. I've never been to an overall nicer Subway, in several senses of the word. The only drawback is, well, it's a Subway, and the food is not gourmet. But, hey, it's good for a quick bite and not hard on the pocketbook."}
{"text":"I have gone at this particular Subway a few times in the late morning. Whenever I go there the sandwich maker behind the counter is not too friendly.  I choose not to go to this one, but do go to other Subway shops."}
{"text":"Oh well, once in a while I go back to subway to try their sandwiches.   I had a corned beef, SHE had rotisserie chicken.  Tastless corned beef, flavorless rye bread.   HER chicken was grainy?   There is no worthwhile hoagie in the Valley."}
{"text":"Please people, wise-up.  These Sandwiches are awful.  Cheap Italian cold cuts on a big hotdog roll do not make a Sub sandwich.  

First, the meats are pre-sliced and of very poor quality. 

The vegatables have been in the bin too long with brown bits in the lettuce and tomatoes that were sliced while George W. was still prez.  

And people, that is a hotdog roll, not a sub roll.  No structure, no body.  

Look at the pretty signs over the counter, now look at the sandwich that you are about to eat.  Do they look the same?  

Well, you got what you paid for, and you didn't pay much.  

I swear, some people eat for the fuel, not for the taste or quality of what they shove down thier cakehole."}
{"text":"I've had the best experiences w/this entire Staff...
  *Well-Greeted, Timely and Precise orders, Friendly*
They're never too overwhelmed to accommodate my/any 'orders'.  They stay calm, regardless of the number of customers in line [not usually 2+ahead].
   if You are patient and specific, not demanding, about your items, They'll get it right!!"}
{"text":"I mean it was a subway on the strip in a hotel.  OK, prices are going to be skewed, but $12 for a footlong turkey sub?  C'mon!  And it wasn't even that great!  

Not to mention I was standing there to order at the counter and the total jerk of a guy looked passed me and asked my husband what he wanted to order!  My hubby, being a gentlemen let me order first, but it was really rude!  I was standing there and he totally ignored me.  What a @#$!  

It is nice to have fast food in the hotel, but $12 footlongs are a bit much for Subway quality."}
{"text":"Nice workers and food is consistently good. They are seriously understaffed.  It seems at the busiest times of day they only have one person working out if there is another I have no idea where they are. Makes for a long wait to get a sub to go."}
{"text":"Decent coffee, although they offer only milk and no cream so if u like cream with ur coffee then u might wanna try else where. But the coffee itself pretty decent."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. I had to repeat literally everything I said and the chick still screwed up my food. They tried to charge me for stuff I ordered but they didn't add to my sandwich then they argued when I pointed out they forgot to add it to my food but still wanted to charge me for it. so annoying. It's just a sandwich it's not rocket science."}
{"text":"Had probably the worst costumer service I've ever had today. Gave the wrong sandwich to my grandma because they were too busy talking to pay attention. Then when she asked them to remake it they were so rude that she asked for her money back. Then when my father and I went back to have them make it because she was hungry but was too upset to deal with them they refused us service AND refused to give us the number to corporate and told us we'd \"have to find it ourselves\". And it was the manager who had an awful attitude with us first! Completely disgusted with this! It was like thy had never worked in costumer service before. Never going back there again!!! Awful people! Honestly id give them negative stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Only a crooked restaurant would advertise a $6 meal and charge $6.10 for it.    I don't know what kind of scam the cashier is running... So I will never stop here again.   Don't trust them.

Oh, and the dining room is way too small."}
{"text":"I would say more about the food, but after waiting in line for 20 minutes and only having one new customer get served in front of me, I decided to leave. The service was very slow. Luckily the employee who is on her break in the dining room was able to sit there and enjoy watching all the customers wait"}
{"text":"At first I was reluctant to stop here, as the subway is located inside of a convenience store.  However, the subways actually completely separate inside of the convenient store, so it's not like you're getting the nasty stuff you're get at Circle K.

I must say that the staff here is extremely friendly.  An example of high school students who understand how to treat customers and how to hold down a job properly."}
{"text":"Teenage girl working behind the counter cannot be bothered to prepare and ingredients.  Instead of doing her job, she says they are \"out\" of pepperoni, shredded cheese, green peppers, and three kinds of chips. 

But she has plenty of time to chat win her friend at one of the tables about some boy she wants to... Well I won't use the same f word she used. 

So this is worth raising the minimum wage for, eh?"}
{"text":"Not much to say. They do their best to match other Subway's coupons and I think for that, they've stolen me from the Subway on Stephanie near Target (Even when I don't have a coupon). What's really cool about this location is that it's right next to Green Valley Market so you can take it to go and run next door and get a big bag of chips and a bottle of Coke. A little tough to get into the parking lot, but the alert driver should have no real issues. Overall, it's a quieter store, not slow, just quieter and it has a more intimate feel to it, meaning it's easier to communicate how you want the sandwich prepared. Also, I never met an accent that was overwhelming here and impaired the sandwich makers ability to understand my instructions. One of the better locations out there as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Placed orders all the time with the app, this time I got there 5 min early and they hadn't started making sandwich, that wouldn't be that bad but they were making sandwiches for people that came in after me, so it would of been faster to just go in and order VERY frustrating considering I use app to save time"}
{"text":"Terra le service ordered on line , they show soup on menu, let you pay it then arrive and don't refund and don't provide the product, this location is terrible"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!! 
For one the service is unbelievably bad for one the employees are very rude, two there is only ever one person working so they have to finish a whole order before starting the next person also they had one type of cheese to choose from no steak, and when I asked for pickles on the side they put them touching the bun rolled up on the inside of the wrapper so my sandwich was soggy when I got home. I live in Tuscany and there aren't many options but I'm never going back there again! You shouldn't either"}
{"text":"Yes it's just Subway, but I like it for what it is. It's extremely clean, the staff is well-groomed and they keep their gloves on and the food tastes fresh. 

Subway provides a good option when I'm on the go, want something healthy and don't feel like steering out of my comfort zone in the interim. 

Subway also provides a economic option for lunch goers. I can get a six inch sub, large soda and baked lays for about $5. Not bad Subway! 

I will end on the note that this Subway is on the Chaparral Plaza. Star right there."}
{"text":"Another solid Subway experience. This is a nice and clean Subway with a solid selection of options. It's your typical Subway, but the staff is friendly, they wear gloves and are clean...and they are friendly! I enjoy Subway on quick days where I need lunch for a economic price. I can't really beat $5 for a meal deal with a sandwich, chips and soda. Well done Subway! My waistline thanks you."}

Employee was EXTREMELY SLOW, they didn't have any guacamole, and they were \"all out of chicken\" at 4pm on a Saturday?

Ridiculous

Absolutely unacceptable"}
{"text":"Same old Subway, but in a nice Downtown location. If I worked in Downtown Phoenix on a regular basis, this would be my go-to Subway on days that I felt like the so-so Sandwich. Subways are all the same, but you know what you're getting and for that, they are A-OK. The sandwich will never blow your mind, but it will also fill you up and give you the fuel you need to get through the day. They do an excellent job offering food at reasonable prices (often times with a nice discount promo) and I can leave with a 6 inch sub, bag of chips and large soda for under $6. Cheap, fast and decent? I'll take it!"}

I walked in and said hi.. the girl replied with, \"I just closed my register, I can't make you anything.\" I asked her aren't you open 24 hours? She said, \"yes, but I closed myself out on the register so I can't do anything for 10 minutes.\" So I suggested I at least give my order, and that'll take up some time while the system reloads. She then said she was clocked out and couldn't help me. It's too bad I can't give zero stars."}

Went ahead and ordered, to-go, and headed home. Five minutes later, started eating and the chicken was cold (even though it was toasted), stringy, and hard and the garlic and cheese bread wasn't toasted at all. It tasted like it wasn't even done being made before being used-- doughy. Won't come back here"}
{"text":"I just visited this Subway with my 3 grandchildren. One of them was having a problem deciding what he wanted to eat and was very unhappy. That's when Romeo, stepped in and offered up true kindness in addition to the sandwiches. What could have been an unpleasant dinner wound up having all of us smiling. It's amazing how an employee can make you want to come back for more. Great meals, clean restaurant and most of all a great experience.

**This was posted by my mom, this was her experience**"}
{"text":"Hey I'm a fan of subway and I can't really complain about the sandwiches, but this place in particular is way under staffed.  There are never many people there but that's probably because they know that it would take forever to get their sandwich if they did go."}
{"text":"What I like about this Subway is that they are well staffed and fast. Being right next to campus they can get very busy but they are ready for it."}
{"text":"The sandwich wasn't sloppily made and didn't fall apart the instant I opened the package.  I ate at a subway in San Francisco that was of that caliber.  So with that being said, obviously, Subways can vary wildly in quality.  

I was staying on the strip, and there was a closer Subway at Circus Circus which I avoided due to all the 1-star reviews.  So I gave this one a chance since it was just a few minute drive.  

I definitely do not regret giving this one a chance, as I've come here a few times during my trip here.  Sandwich quality and customer service were 5-stars, I took off a star due to the price; a part of which is no doubt the location, so maybe it'd be more of 4.5 star location than 4."}

I've sorta been looking for a better place to grab lunch while I am at flight school, and this may be just the real legitimate reason I have been looking for. 

Then.... In my irritation, I try to find a price list for the sandwiches, and the pages are removed from the site. I stumbled upon the nutritional info for the sandwiches, and discovered that while none of the sandwiches are particularly \"healthy\", the Tuna sandwich is right up there in the mix for the worst. How do you screw up a tuna fish sandwich and make it unhealthy? Tuna, mayo, cheese, and bread. That's it...  Drown it in mayo. That would be my answer."}
{"text":"So sick of these employees not putting the correct amount of items on the sandwiches and when you ask them to they give you and attitude."}
{"text":"$5 Foot Long!

There is not much to say about Subway that will differentiate it from another.   This location is clean.   I went around noon and was able to get in and out without any fuss.

I would recommend if you need to get lunch fast.

Atmosphere - Clean (very important quality for any fast food establishment)
Price - same as others"}

{"text":"It's Subway.. not much else I can say except that this one has a real asshole working the cash register.. the guy who made my sub was nice enough but stark contrast to the cashier jerk off. When I was 18 years old I loved working, seems like this kid not only hated his job but didn't care for any of its customers either. 

The stars are for the sandwich, spinach and the guy who made mine. Otherwise Ill probably only go to the one next to work, if I have to."}
{"text":"I wanted a Veggie sub after my workout and decided to come here to this location against my gut feeling.

So they didn't have any spinach, and their toppings were really skimpy. So my veggie sub was a bit naked =(  so I ordered a soup on the side.My sister ordered the daily deal which I thought was a steal for only $5 bucks. 

So when I ran my card I was pretty baffled that meal totaled over $15 bucks! I wasn't upset about the error the guy made...I was more upset he didn't understand he overcharged me. In the end he made me a sub to go because I refused to even swipe my card for a refund. 

It was a simple mistake and some chic was rushing in his defense...but this is one Subway I'll pass on."}
{"text":"It's Subway.. though the funny thing about this location is generally how rude the workers are. They act as if they are doing you the biggest favor by even being there. Snotty bitch behind the counter rolled her eyes at me when I asked if they had spinach leaves. I wanted to grab the half dressed sandwich and smack her with it but.. since I'm a nice fucking guy and would never do any sort of bullshit like that I just smiled and left... never to return.

My sandwich was pretty good.. they have the best light mayo.. when in Surprise there isn't much you can do when it comes to a sandwich.. next time Ill just go to Sprouts."}

This guy is so on point he aligns the cookies perfectly and is always working hard every time I visit.  This guy is on the management / owner track.  I'm a businessman / entrepreneur, if you don't get on top of this and see it ill take advantage.  Thx :)"}
{"text":"You have to go to this Subway and have Jason make your sandwich.  He has the cucumbers and tomatoes all lined up for visual effect and so they don't dry out. He takes such pride in building your sandwich. He even caressed the bag gently after he put in my sandwich.  It was such a work of art that I gently cradled my sandwich to the car. Not to mention how nice Jason is.  Best Subway experience ever!"}
{"text":"The food is really yummy but the people are rude. I walked in and they stared at me like wtf are you doin here..."}
{"text":"Why can't this subway be normal?

I've come here many times as it's close and I love the drive thru component.  My experiences here are NEVER good.  

I've had 2 sandwiches be made incorrectly.  The first time was over a month ago, I ordered a turkey bacon flatbread and got a chicken bacon.  The girl was very kind when I went in and remade my sandwich.  

Today was a different story.  I ordered a 6\" turkey bacon avocado on white flatbread with cheese lettuce onion banana peppers pickles olives and ranch.   To start off, the girl who took my order in the drive thru didn't ask me step by step, she took my whole orders. I then moved up to the window and she told me that they are out of white flatbread and asked if I wanted wheat which I said was fine.  I was rung out by a man and because of the interaction with the girl who took my order I wanted to check it.

Immediately I knew it was wrong.  There was spinach, tomatoes, green pepper, and mustard.  AND to top it off, it was on white flatbread which I was told they didn't have.  

I went inside and told them this.  The female had a lot of tattoos and her ears gauged.  She wasn't concerned with my incorrectly made sandwich one bit.  The man working had to tell her to remake mine first.  She began making it on wheat flatbread and I said \"Do you have white since you made my other sandwich on white?\".  She said \"this is all we have\".  Meanwhile the guy working went and got a bag of frozen white flatbread out for me.  She CONTINUED putting it on the wheat even though he was going to heat up the white for me.  Unbelievable.  He told her to give me a footlong for the inconvenience which was appreciated.  She then made my sandwich and I left.  

I am appalled that you have someone working at an organization like this.  Being a food and beverage manager even if I worked at Subway that type of behavior and level of customer service is unacceptable.  

She looked like she was completely miserable.  If she's going to be in customer service she should definitely be in the back of house with her attitude.  The name on the receipt was Juliette.  

I don't know if this location is understaffed or if they need more extensive training but the inconsistency in service and quality is very noticeable and will turn away business including mine."}
{"text":"Ordered turkey 6 inch sandwich. They forgot the green pepper, cucumbers and the spinach had a few fig leaf sized pieces at a cost of $ 4.75. The tomato on the sandwich was 3 very small old pale pieces. They used to give you a real portion of vegetables. They had all new staff and claimed to have the same owner. Awful."}
{"text":"Very Very Very slow. Seems they would rather bake bread and eat their own lunch than make yours."}
{"text":"SUBWAY is an everyday thing for us. My son LlVES Subway.  I just never really yelp about it. This location is by far the best one in my area. Jay the owner is always in the store and HE works the counter when needed. He is always friendly and has kind words for his patrons.  The sandwiches are always fresh. Now with the Subway app.. we can order ahead, skip all the lines and have your food waiting when you are ready!!  Great job everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Subway is Subway....I know.....I get it.  But, this one is the best in Pickering by far!
They load the toppings on beyond belief so don't ask for double of anything!
The buns which are truly the deal breaker in most sub shops are larger than most other Subways in the area and taste fresh not soggy.
Staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  A bit pricier than the average Subway (i.e. $6.00+ for foot-longs, $8.00+ for foot-long meals).

Open for breakfast at 0700.  Closes as late as 1000 p.m.  Thank goodness for the late close as there's not much to eat around here at night except for the Speedway convenience store nearby."}
{"text":"Customer service is simply atrocious.  Employees seem to move in slow motion, and they scrimp on sandwich ingredients compared to other Subways.  The employees mumble when they talk to you.  The place looks unsanitary and the last sandwiches I bought there made me sick after I ate them.  I don't believe their food prep and storage would meet health department guidelines.  Their most recent inspection certificate posted is dated October of 2017...and this is March of 2018.  I will never patronize this place again."}
{"text":"To the owner/s:

You should not be putting a 19 y/o ALONE on the 11p-6am shift with homeless and meth heads roaming through. We completed our purchase and found out she was alone to defend herself should there be a **it show and seemed pretty tired from working another job. As an open carry state, it disgusts me that you would even consider scheduling a person who is tiny to defend themselves! The meth head in there tonight talking to himself and picking the scabs off his face may not seem like a threat to you owners, but how do you know when his high may turn lethal?? 

Do you make so much money from 11-6am that you can not consider being closed during these dangerous hours?? Perhaps you don't give af about your staff? Either way, my money will not sponsor the danger you put your staff through, especially a young woman who consistently works this asinine shift. Reconsider your hours."}
{"text":"I come in with two of my sisters to subway 
All we have is $15 dollars in gift cards from our parents to spend and a couple extra dollars just in case we go over 
We tell the lady ( older gray/brown hair) we want 3 of the 5.49 deals so she asks us what kind of bread and what kind of meat , we continue to make our sandwiches and we get to the end and I ask for our drinks ( which comes with the meal) she then tells me , oh you want to add a drink 
I said no it comes with one and she continues to tell me that the meat we chose is not apart of the 5.49 meals and now is being charged as a separate sandwich ?
Seriously ? I am a General manager and if my employees pulled some shit like this to make extra money I would be pissed , I knowing try to run my card for the extra money and I know there's not enough to cover the ridiculous scam this employee just pulled so it declines in-front if everyone! Talk about embarrassing I had to sit there and pull money from my savings to pay for this food  , which wouldn't be a huge deal if that's what I decided I wanted to do but we chose this deal for a reason and a very un friendly employee saw an opportunity to pull some stupid shit , this is why subway is going out of business !"}
{"text":"The selection is of a normal subway. The first breakfast sandwich I got here was kind of cold and it wasn't supposed to be. The server was friendly"}
{"text":"This place is your typical subway. I find that they are able to keep up well with their lunch rush. They always greet you when you walk in the door. They are also eager to take your order. The credit card machine was broken so they had to manually run my credit card, but the cashier didn't break a sweat when the line was getting long. I'd go back to this location for sure."}
{"text":"I dropped my cookie on the floor.  I asked for a new one and the employee told me I had to buy a new cookie.  WTF!  Thanks for the great customer service."}
{"text":"I was hired here a few months ago. I'm pregnant and needed some part time hours to help make ends meet and had applied at several different places, being forthcoming about my pregnancy. No dice...so I chose not to disclose my pregnancy when applying. After all, I needed the money to help my family. I was hired, and though the manager Kathy is a hard person to get along with, I was offered more hours, asked to come in early as well as cover shifts, which I obliged. 2 weeks ago, a co-worker informed Kathy of my pregnancy and my hours went from 28 hours a week down to 10, and Monday I was terminated and given no reason (in a cowardly move, over the phone).
I understand that we live in a right to work state and no reason is needed upon termination. Kathy is well versed in firing people (in fact, the person she fired after hiring me ended up robbing the store- Kathy had forgotten to ask for her key back), so I'm sure she knew this as well and made sure to let me know she \"didn't care\" that I needed the extra money for my 2 year old daughter and 10 year old stepson. In my 2 months of employment, I saw at least 6 employees come and go. Most worked with Kathy for only one day and would no call/no show the following shift.
I'm an adult and I am a hard worker. I would have stuck through as long as possible and endured my mangers constant demeaning and condescending treatment. I had no clue she would stoop so low as to fire me for being pregnant. 
This is discrimination at its finest but legally there is very little that can be done. However, I firmly believe that you cannot treat people like garbage continually without karma coming back to you, and given how obviously miserable Kathy is with her life, she seems to be living in a constant state of bad karma. She's a mean hearted person who simply cannot see the good in any situation and this is probably the contributing factor to this store's lack of success. Good luck to Raj, my ex-coworkers and the customers that choose to dine here. Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"Good Location. Consistent in their food quality and service.  Just what I expect from a Subway!

The line crew is fast and efficient.  This location is a bit smaller so seating is limited, however.  During the lunch rush, it may be better to get it to go and mozy on down to the park down the street."}
{"text":"Was on this side of town and decided to get a bite to eat with my Brother!

This subway was a bit busy but nonetheless they were quick and efficient.  The service was great, the food was even better.

The place was clean and spacious with a lot of room to sit down.

Our sandwiches were delicious.  I'd come here again!  I did notice that their vegetables were FRESH and so was the bread."}
{"text":"Sometimes when I meet my friends that work across town for lunch, this is where I go.

The layout of this place seems to make more sense than other stores further west of this location.

The people here are super, super friendly and they make it kind of fun to order your food.  The ingredients do seem a bit more fresh than other Subways I go to as well.

Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Great new store, quality employees.  Very clean.  Great food!  Excited another one has opened up.  Right next Fresh n Easy!  Very Friendly!"}
{"text":"The good thing about Subway is that there is always another one down the street.  I've been here a few times and this place is a drag.

While the place is clean and the employees are nice, it is way slower to get a sandwich made here.

I recommend the Subway in the Walmart Shopping Center or the one next to Fresh & Easy on Durango and Tropicana."}
{"text":"When you say the word \"DEAL\" the first thing to come to mind is Subway.

Sing it with me!

FIVE...FIVE DOLLAR...FIVE DOLLAR FOOT LOOOOONG!

Yes, I am singing.  My choice is the Oven Roasted Chicken Foot Long on Nine Grain Wheat Bread. Make it toasted, with provolone cheese, onion, bell pepper, lettuce, tomato and sweet onion sauce.

The restaurant is nice and clean and the people behind the counter are extremely friendly.

Where to go to lunch today?  I definitely would agree to Subway any day of the week."}
{"text":"So Happy that here is a 24 Hour Subway close to my home!  This place presents healthy options when you wanna grab a bite to eat.

I usually come in the evening and notice that the place gets SWAMPED and there is only one employee here to handle everyone.  I would suggest at least two people at all times.  To keep lines small and also for safety at night. (You never know).

The employees here are very friendly .  Usually I would scream and cry inside if they're being skimping on toppings, but no, not this place.

Professional all the way.  Sandwich Artists!  They make it right and they listen well.  They also handle multiple sandwich orders quickly and efficiently.  I am a fan, just need more employees at night I would think."}
{"text":"I'm a chronic Subway Eater and I'm glad that there are so many around town.  However, this location disappoints me.

I've been here a few times this summer and I always feel like this place is lacking.  Lacking what you may ask?  Lacking the friendly greetings when you walk in. Lacking the attentiveness and quickness the employees come out from \"behind\" the kitchen.  The employees are of a different caliber than other locations.  They seem like apathetic teenagers that do the bare minimum to get your out of their hair.

The last time I came in on Saturday I ordered my usual:

Toasted Foot Long Oven Roasted Chicken on Flat Bread with, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumber, Pickles, Olives, Bell Pepper, Onion, Vinegar.  

I didn't get the toasted part because their toaster was broken!  They did microwave it but that kind of defeats the purpose of \"eat fresh.\"  You would think a restaurant would have a backup toaster on hand as it's such a key tool in their process."}
{"text":"Let it be known that not all Subway stores are created equal!

I was sorely disappointed when I stopped in here for lunch last week (Tuesday Evening) for some dinner.

I had my usual Oven Roasted Chicken Foot Long on Wheat with: lettuce, tomato, onion, green bell pepper, cucumbers and sweet onion sauce.  $5 DOLLAR FOOT LONG!

We were the only ones in the store and it took forever for us to get through our order.  It seems like one of the employees were new on the job.  The final straw for me giving two stars was that this location had NO LIGHT LEMONADE!

I'm wish this place would include the lemonade... I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt and try this location again - although I'm almost tempted to just drive 2 miles down the road to the one on S. Fort Apache and Sunset.  

I think definitely one of the people behind the sandwich counter was new."}
{"text":"It's not a secret. I LOVE subway.

Sometimes when I want to \"change it up\" or go to another location by work, this is the place.

The people are friendly - it does get really busy during lunch.  

Sometimes what you would think are the front doors or locked - but the other pair of doors around the corner usually facing Fort Apache are always open.  There are a lot more tables to sit at here, but it does make it seem a little bit more crowded.  

I get the same Subway quality that I expect from all locations here!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Subway twice and both times I have been disappointed.

Firstly - it appears that none of the workers behind the counter communicate well (mainly the cashier and the sandwich maker).

On two different occasions, spanning 2-3 months, I have been OVERCHARGED for my sandwich.  I have to check my receipt and then wait another 5-10 minutes to get my refund.

The assembly line leaves much to be desired as well.  I did not want to \"go there\" but I clearly communicate what I want on my sandwich at other subways just fine but the workers here appear to struggle with the English language.

I do frequent other Subways and they are very efficient in building sandwiches.  This one, not so much.  The management here really needs to train their workers better."}
{"text":"Service was good when i went then again the store was very quiet. They had my  raspberry cheesecake cookies sold here very rare!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really not a chain-reviewing person, but I do think it's important to note differences between some of these locations. 

To be clear, I'd rather grab a sandwich from almost any other local establishment around me in Ohio City. But, sometimes times do call for a quick, easy, cheap sandwich. I have no idea what's in the meats they use, where they get their produce, etc. For that reason, I don't eat Subway often. But, compared to other fast food chains, it's one of the better ones. 

Now on to location specifics: 

GOOD: 
- Always clean and the owners are very friendly
- They've never been out of anything I wanted, even during rush times
- Veggies are always fresh looking, not brown, slimy or rotten 
- Located in the heart of Ohio City, easy to get to

NOT SO GOOD: 
- Location: it doesn't attract the greatest of folks. It's located in the shopping plaza that has a Key Bank, H&R Block, a Rent-A-Center, a dollar store and a Cousins Beauty shop. Once I saw a teenage mother beat the crap out of her toddler son just because he was thirsty. She stormed out of Subway and dragged him in the beauty shop to get herself something instead. Please stop procreating if you can't put your child first. Anyways... It's always a little scary for me to go there on my own. 
- Parking: although it's free, I've encountered more idiots in this lot than I can count. 
- It's Subway and there are a bajillion other better, locally-sourced options within walking distance. 

So there you have it. Make your own call."}

I left my card on the register got a water cup and he charged me 10.50$?? I said footlong of sweet onion chicken .... he charged me two 6 inches, whatever its two bucks, it's the FACT that he doesn't accept his wrongdoing and won't give my refund of TWO DOLLARS.  I know customers aren't always right but you serious? Over two
Dollars he won't accept his wrongdoing, WONT give my money back. WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD I ORDER TWO SIX INCH SWEET ONION CHICKEN?????????? I still have the receipt very disappointed in this subway. Sorry but this was Very unprofessionally dealt with...."}
{"text":"Their hours are listed incorrectly, I called them and the lady that answered said they are already closed at 1am, not 2am like they lied.

I don't understand why businesses lie about their hours here on Yelp."}
{"text":"Parking is cramped and awkward at this store; as you're backing out or pulling in, you're sharing driveway/parking area with an Al Phillips dry cleaners drive through area. Always homeless folks inside or right by front door, as well as seedy characters sitting on back stoops of nearby businesses, and they always seem to be giving people the once over as they enter/exit their cars. Service inside was ok, simple sandwich orders took quite a long time. Food was good. There is a drive through here; I haven't used it but nice to know."}
{"text":"Unfriendly staff, dirty restroom w no tp.... how difficult can it be.... it's Subway! And I'm laid back... no excuse for unfriendly/poor service in my opinion. I've served the public all my adult life... if it's not for you DONT WORK W THE PUBLIC"}
{"text":"Overall, this is a Great Subway with friendly service and fast food preparation (line moves quick). The locations is very convenient to UNCC and having Harris Teeter next door is a huge bonus; I'll sometime grab a sandwich before buying groceries (Never a good idea to shop hungry).

The restaurant is also clean and tidy. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Subway I have ever been to. Walked it very hungry I did the two or more footlongs for ten dollars. I ordered the Chicken, bacon, ranch sub and everything looked like it had been sitting their for a while. Nothing looked fresh like subway says to be. The metal counter they have where they're making your sub was dirty, looked it they wipe it down once ever ten subs they made. Ultimately I got home ate half of my sub and just couldn't finish eating it. 

Like some other reviews mention the staff is kind of rude so you shouldn't go in there when your very hungry or you might end up leaving upset."}

{"text":"I give it a one star because I have to rate it! I've been to this subway a few times out of convenience  but will never again waste my money there. The two Hindu women there in the weekends are horrible at preparing the subs! they flatten the bread as they cut it, and tear the bread uneven as they part it in half. They throw the meat on and everything else all sloppy, and if your distracted, because they will both talk to you at the same time if you have more than one sub, will put so much of the condiments that at the end all you get is SLOPS! They act like the subs are for free or something! These ladies pretend to be friendly, but quickly get attitude if you don't  understand them. NEVER again will I go there! I rather drive a bit further for a better sub next time."}
{"text":"The employees are very polite and outgoing. Every time we've been there, it's been teenagers working. They focus on the customers and their jobs, and they get the orders right."}
{"text":"They take forever, they are not polite. They say what do you want instead of what can I get you. They will burn your sandwich. They spent 20 whole minutes making my sandwich and the guy told me he enjoys fucking people's lunch hour up. I do not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Very pleased with my sandwich, the server was just outstanding. Made my sandwich the way I wanted and I even tip both girls for their hardwork. Thank you girls! Your awesome."}
{"text":"This subway is close to our house and we always get good friendly service and tasty sandwiches. Jimmy and Kevin are great. They are efficient and professional and do a great job. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The man working there was not wearing gloves while handling gloves and he had long, dirty unkept nails.  They were so dirty they were black.  It was so gross!  I took pictures but it's hard to tell.  It was really disgusting it just makes me wonder what happens in the back of that store if this is going on in the front.  I for one will not be going here again who knows food poisoning might be next or whatever u can catch from dirty nails."}
{"text":"The subways are for most part always quick and easy with good customer service. This subway was having a horrible day. The customer service was lacking. The two ladies were not talking to each other or helping on another. Older lady was rude and didn't even talk to anybody coming in the door or ask if younger lady needed help.  Younger lady was doing her best but was getting frustrated with a line of customers and kids playing with the mother not controlling her kids. adding another employee or getting rid of the older lady would be suggested."}
{"text":"Was in the area and was craving subway so I drove to the closest one to me.  Parking was quick, its in a center so there is plenty of parking.  When I walked up there was a staff cleaning the windows and I am so OCD so that makes me happy lol.  

Another staff helped me inside and I just got a meatball sub on italian herbs and cheese.  I added cheese and onions on it was really good.  I mean the staff can't really mess up your order because its right in front of you.

The place was very clean and the staff was very nice to me, as I was leaving the guy outside cleaning the windows stopped and opened the door for me!  Next time I am craving subway I will have to go to this place!"}
{"text":"I wish there wasn't glass between me and the people behind the counter! They are so damn rude! I'd slap the crap out of them! Their lettuce was soggy along the my sandwich! Please do not support this shithole!"}
{"text":"I actually swore off subway for awhile after I moved here from GA. Not because I didn't like subway anymore, but because on the 3 day drive here,  I think we ate subway for nearly EVERY meal. Apparently truckers LOVE their footlongs. :P By the time we got here, I was absolutely sick of subs, and fast food in general, really. 
Finally the craving for a tasty sandwich came back, and off to subway I go. Tastes just as good as I remember. This location was clean, the service good, the vegetables fresh, and they even had spinach, which is something that you don't find as often back home. Perhaps all the subways here have spinach, but I wouldn't know. 
Only thing that I didn't like, was that they didn't have sliced Monterrey cheddar, only shredded. Weird."}
{"text":"Don't expect double meat on your wrap. Do to expect to be greeted with a friendly smile or have any of your questions answered. 

Been to many Subways but I won't return to this one."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took forever for the lady to even figure out we were standing there waiting. She finally came out didn't even crack a smile and took her sweet time to wash her hands and put on her gloves. Probably took her 5 minutes to make the sub. Slow and unfriendly! The cookie was disgusting and overcooked. There was math problems written all over the bag of cookies I might add... classy. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Came in during a lunch rush for my favorite steak and cheese on flatbread sub and the employees were on point-- they were quick but not even the slightest bit sloppy. All ingredients looked fresh and everything appeared very clean. Best subway I've been to in a while. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Driver through? Awesome but check your sandwich first before you take off. Because I didn't simply because I'm stupid enough to trust the person who confirms Italian herbs bread toasted with extra cheese, instead I got a cold sandwich on white bread and no extra cheese! Subways are dime a dozen this location is none existent to me! Bye!"}
{"text":"Windell or however you spell his name walked away from the front of the store for five mins didn't mention that he was leaving or anything everyone was stuck waiting in line for him to return. I shouldn't have to wait in line for 20 mins for a sandwich! A sandwich! Never coming back again"}
{"text":"If o could I give you 0 stars
What the fuck is going onnnnn
I'm going into the place and the employee totally ignoring me when I'm saying hello or trying to order
What the helllll?????
I just left the place"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Solid lunch.

I'm reviewing Subway because I'm bored. If you really need to read a review to decide whether or not to go to a place that makes generic sandwiches, you need to re-evaluate your life.

I like Subway. If you've never heard of Subway and you're deciding to go because of my review, I just want you to know that the sound you just heard is my palm hitting my forehead."}
{"text":"I frequent this subway quite often. Sam and Wilson are always professional and beyond friendly. Sam has even learned what sub and cookies I always get. Great place."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a subway sandwich for lunch. I frequent this location because it's near home.

My personal favorite is the $5 foot long menu. Eat half now and you have lunch for later. My usual is the cold cut combo loaded with all the vegetables and honey mustard. But that's the beauty of Subway, you can customize it any way your tummy desires. 

Consistent subs. Friendly and fast service. Clean facilities."}
{"text":"I should give it NO STARS, but it won't let me.  The three girls working there were screaming at each other in Spanish, the man ahead of me had been waiting a long time, the guy 2 ahead of me got charged wrong and the lady was arguing with him (he had a coupon), the lady making my sandwich lost her knife and found it on the counter in a dirty place between the oven and another machine, I asked for her to use another one and she looked at me like I was crazy.  Reluctantly she went in the back to get another one while rolling her eyes.  I stayed to dine there so I could experience more, and EVERY ORDER was screwed up, they were rude to everyone.  And the keyboard to the register was covered in plastic wrap and completely disgusting."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a subway.  They let a customer cut in line at noon for a drink. The breads always stale and meat tastes old. I took the time to write the owner with no response.  I can see why subway supported Jared knowing he was into child porn since 2009.  Subway is a joke.  Please boycott subways at all cost unless your have no moral fiber and agree with child porn."}
{"text":"Avoid this subway 

As I watched the employee place dark lettuce on my sub I asked him if he can see that it's gone bad and he's replies 
\"No one elese complains\"....

Or when he closes up early before the time it says on there hours of operation 

I got kicked out because he was closing early and he was supposed to be open"}
{"text":"Snails could work faster and with more emotion than the people that work here.. literally spend 45 mins when there's two people in line.. not only that but they have no sense of hygiene at all , cross contamination and nasty attitudes."}
{"text":"Very clean place! Staff is super friendly and greets you with a smile! Best subway I have ever been to by far!"}
{"text":"Subway is that convenient fast place to grab something healthy. The staff here are great. They never let you wait too long and always seem to be in their game! I enjoy coming here!"}
{"text":"This was the most magnificent sandwich I have ever had in my mouth !! Thank you Chelsey and Mark for the outstanding customer service. I will definitely be visiting this location again !!"}
{"text":"Good clean and open 24 hours!  Get a as Norwich for lunch and coffee from hollers cuppa"}
{"text":"Been in here twice. Staff is unfriendly and constantly playing inappropriate music. I tried to go this morning at 9am but the door was locked even though they open at 7am. I knocked quite loudly and despite workers being in the front of the store did not get let in."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast - big mistake!! 

Thought I'd try their egg-white omelet sandwich, you know the healthy one they advertise. Was told they were \"out.\" How can you be out of the thing you are advertising???? 

Went to pay and was told that they take no coupons - so why did I get them in the mail for the breakfast options?? No policy posted anywhere about this. . . 

Finally, was offered a \"combo\" but then told it doesn't exist for the sandwich I ordered. 

Basically this location engages in unethical practices AND the sandwich was pretty mediocre. Save the money and go someplace local!"}
{"text":"Really clean place. Staff is usually friendly. Ordered online tonight so I wouldn't have to wait. Awesome experience! Walked in and the \"artist\" gave me my sandwich and left all in about 1 minute. Will def use online ordering again!"}
{"text":"Came in for a tuna salad, subway was clean, staff was very friendly. Food was fresh, everything was nice and stocked. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Came into subway, the person stated she was by herself and after taking a long customer she decided to take a person that came in after i was waiting in line. Didnt say sorry but i m not sure if they were friends but we all have places to be."}
{"text":"This is Subway sandwiches.  If you've ever been to a subway location, they don't vary all that much.  The subs from this Subway are exactly what you would expect.

They're incredibly disorganized when it comes to organizing and making your sub. I can give them a pass for that early on, but not over the long term. 

What I like about this location is that it's inside and connected to the TTC.  The two nearest locations both require you to go outside in the winter, and one is located inside a convenience store.  This location is in the new food court at North York Centre.

One of the best things about subway is the cheap sub of the day.  Unfortunately, this location does not post the sub of the day.  You have to ask them for it.

My favourite is the Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki."}
{"text":"Do you know why I like this Subway? No. You don't. So let me tell you... Every time I come in here for lunch it's never busy! And it's not that people don't come in here, it's that the employees are really good about serving their customers. Some Subway locations are pretty hit and miss, but so far this one has been the most consistent."}
{"text":"Oh man the kids that work here crack me up... just because they seem so thrilled to be here (not really). But nonetheless, they're cool kids when you talk to them. It's a small Subway so it can get kinda busy sometimes - especially since it's right across Banner Thunderbird hospital, so you'll see a lot of people in scrubs.

My sandwiches are always consistent here and I haven't encountered any problems yet as far as food quality goes. There are two Subways near me that are the same distance from each other, but I definitely prefer this one over the other location."}
{"text":"Wow.  In from out of state and stopped in and a customer was angry ahead of us. He said some nasty things and walked out. . The person behind the counter did not handle herself in a tactful manner. Swearing out loud while you have customers in your store in unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Subway for over 12 years and it has had its ups and downs. Today it was a wipe out! New staff of young inexperienced workers that ether they don't have a clue on how to make a sub, or the boss is telling them to skimp  on the meats or tuna in order to make you upgrade to a deluxe and pay more! In my book that is as good as stealing! Extremely disappointed and will not go back to this Subway and will pass the word of mouth. Please go and verify it for yourself. To the owner.....please review ethics and conduct for businesses."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Subway in town! I often go with my little boy and they are so friendly and patient while he practices ordering. The service is the best at his Subway and i will drive by several others just to go here for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"terrible customer service! save yourself from coming here, the employers are very rude and the store manager has no idea what shes doing. They laughed ,kept making mistakes on purpose, gave me short change and hanged out with there friends who wasnt currently on duty. this is the worst subway in lasvegas."}
{"text":"This subway is amazing, very clean and very friendly workers... The food looked fresh and tasted good and the employees were very friendly... My sandwich tastes great"}
{"text":"This Subway has a drive thru so, as long as you know what toppings you want, you don't even need to get out of your car! 

Easy enough to get in and out of the location too. 

Personally, I like to hit them up for breakfast. I get the Western Egg White breakfast sandwich on a multigrain muffin. (It always cracks me up when they ask if I want peppers and onions on it, since that's what makes it a \"Western\" egg white breakfast sandwich -- kinda like asking if you want lettuce and tomato on a BLT...?) 

The coffee beats gas station brew and other fast food chains. Put them together and you've got a really reasonably priced breakfast on the go."}
{"text":"During rush times, they really put little care into making the sub, ripping the bread, and so forth. Just a messy sandwich overall."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The sandwiches always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday afternoon when it wasn't really busy and the vibe I got from the employees was that they really disliked their job. I have been here numerous times and its the same thing every time. I also got sick from the food this time which prompted me to write about it. I think I will try avoiding this place from now on."}
{"text":"Saw the negative review, but I was close and thought I would give it a try. The staff was nice, and they were running a promotion on my favorite sandwich. I was there at 1:30, and didn't notice any slow service. A nice place."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Never coming back again. Rating one star only because I have to rate it, otherwise it would be none."}
{"text":"Okay so I came to this subway for a late night grub when I walked up to the door it took like 5 minutes to open the door becuz it was soo late looked like nobody was there"}
{"text":"Vanessa helped me out a great deal. She was very knowledgeable about her sandwiches, and I'd come back at any time. She was very prompt. This subway exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"I feel silly even rating a Subway, but this place is always the best! My husband and I live closer to a different Subway but make it a point to always go to this one and support them.
The employees are always friendly and happy amd the place is always clean. 
Kudos to everyone that works there!"}
{"text":"worst subway you could go to. i asked for the oven roasted chicken footlong. italian herbs and cheese bread, and the bread was hard and dry. old bread! the veggies tasted like shit. old veggies! for sure, this isnt a place you can \"eat fresh\". they had an inspection sign at the window which made me think twice but i was hungry. i shouldve turned around and left right away. go to another subway!"}
{"text":"I get the same order for my son's lunch and the price is different every time. Today I pointed out that he charged me twice for chips and it shows it right on the receipt.

Update: We still patronize this Subway and the billing seems to have normalized. Maybe it's turning around?"}
{"text":"Subway was... subway. The service was slow, however the food made it worth it. I always get the Italian bun, roast beef, lettuce, cheese, mayo, mustard and pickles. Honestly, I'm a little bit surprised how long it takes them to make a fairly simple sandwich. I didn't ask for it warmed and they didn't even have to cut the bread. They could barely hear me, and it got to the stage where I was half shouting at them! Seriously? I shouldn't have to practically shout, especially not three times that I want lettuce! The food however, is consistently good and it's a nice and quiet place for lunch."}
{"text":"Takes 10+ minutes to make 1 sandwich via drive-thru - no customers inside at the time. 
Usually gets topping incorrect. Have only seen teenagers working the last few times I've gone. Wish it would close and Jersey Mike's would replace it."}
{"text":"Terrible Subway. Unfriendly staff that doesn't give a hoot."}
{"text":"Seriously irritated..  it's 7:45 in the evening and this Subway sandwich shop is out of wheat bread?  Last week they were out of American cheese? It's a sandwich shop for Pete's sakes. I could see being out of a specialty item...But wheat bread? Never again at this location. They jacked up a tuna sandwich last week and were out of unsweetened tea... It's on a MAIN street in Vegas people!"}
{"text":"I work in the service field, so I completely understand having a bad day. I also understand that you can't let that affect your work. Well the foreign ladies that work here have no perception of that, or maybe they're just in a perpetual bad mood. I've been to this location several times and the ladies have never been friendly, but today was especially bad. When I walked in an older woman rolled her eyes at me- heaven forbid you have to help a customer! She proceeded to stare at me silently waiting for me to order. No greeting, nothing. She acted like I was inconveniencing her by ordering two uncomplicated subs. I normally always tip, this time I didn't. I'll definitely be calling a manager there because those women have no business working there."}
{"text":"Staff is beyond rude.  I will never step foot in this establishment again. I ordered a sandwich and they treated me like I was dumb, these people need basic training in customer service."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE customer service.

We show up a little before 5 on a Wednesday and ask for a sandwich tray. Nothing weird, mind you, just a regular ol' sandwich tray. They say no. We asked why. They said they need 24 hours. We have been all over the US and have never heard of this \"requirement.\" We asked if they could make us 5 sandwiches. They said yes. We then said \"Great! Just put them on a tray and cut them into thirds.\" They refused. 

Does this location not want money? Or do they just hire lazy employees with blue hair?"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a lower rating. This is the worst subway I have been to and I love Subway. The staff is rude and argued with me about a discount I used every time I go. The bread was hard and the bacon was not bacon by any means. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in with part of the family to grab some sandwiches to go. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. It seemed a little dark going in. Not sure if this is typical or if a light might have been out. I opted for a six inch Cold Cut Combo, which was actually rather filling. I usually do a foot long, but six inches satisfied this time. We also ordered a Philly Cheese Steak, but got Pastrami by mistake. The kid ate it anyway and said it was pretty tasty. We will return."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst subway ive been to. I asked them to warm up my pastrami and its still cold. My pastrami didnt even melt my cheese. The guy who works there forgot my drink. As much as a sandwich cost there you should get it the way you prefer it."}
{"text":"I takes about 3 minutes for me to walk to this subway from my apartment....and it is always worth it. The guys that make sandwiches there are the best in the business and they are always so friendly and polite. If you go late enough they will even give you freebies...because they are only going to throw them out anyway....so they just give them away. We all love something free...and if you don't then shame on you....LOL!!! Seriously though this guys rock and I will past many subways just to give these guys my money because they show you love for real. So if your ever in my hood over here near paradise valley and Cactus Rd....need a sandwich...and if you late enough coming from the club or a party and want some freebies as well....visit this locale you won't be sorry. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in with a Subway coupon from the mail, and the local owner of this location won't fully honor it. This isn't the first time that this location has put 'special' conditions on what they will honor, usually it's limited ingredients. A while back at this same place I asked for a double row of tomatoes when buying a footlong roast beef, and they told me that tomatoes were too expensive to do that. Really??"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what time of day other reviewers have been to this restaurant but this place is hoppin' at lunch time.  They seem to have their 'assembly line' down to a fine art and can move people through quite quickly.  And I must say, you really can't beat the $5 footlong deal either.  A great place to pick up a quick cheap lunch.

Oh, and I just found their chipotle southwestern sauce... a must have for all future subs!  :)"}
{"text":"Typical Subway, typical service, typical quality, typical subs. Sometimes it's just nice to go to a restaurant and just know what to expect. This Subway location provides just that.

We ventured around the food court and believe me, there's a good selection of options but I truly just wanted something... familiar.

The preparation area was tidy and the staff was quick and efficient. Easy grab and go food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"While the BMT sandwich was good, they refused to substitute a coffee instead of the sugar filled fountain drink thats included with combos. They said it can't be done, meanwhile at other locations they are happy to accommodate this simple request. Will be my first and last time coming to this location."}
{"text":"We had to rush to our daughter's Christmas concert after school and work recently and decided to place an online order. We thought we were ordering from the Promenade location because when you try to order online, three locations come up for Westlake: this one, Crocker Park and Center Ridge. I assumed we had the right one when we selected the \"Detroit\" location. In reality, you have to pass the North Olmsted location to find the 4th Westlake location on the list. WTH? That's absurd and an accident waiting to happen. So when we called to tell them we mistakenly placed an order there, they refused to cancel it. The first woman on the phone said the sandwiches had not been made but a second woman grabbed the phone and insisted they had been made but could not recall what they were. WHATEVER! They refused to refund our money. A few minutes after I hung up, they charged my card. I called back a few minutes later to let them know we had complained to the corporate offices after seeing that they charged my card AFTER I called to ask that they cancel. I know this because my Amex has a feature where within seconds after it is used without it being swiped, they alert me. So the store changed its tune when they knew I had caught them in a lie. They said my husband could stop in the next day to pick up cash but they could not refund the card. We said that was fine. When he arrived, the woman said she could not give cash without that manager present (despite that manager saying she was leaving a note for the morinng manager) and they sent him away. It was clear these people are absolutely desparate for money and they will do anything, including losing the business of customers *permanently* and causing all sorts of problems for themselves if it meant saving a few bucks. So what do you think they do when meat passes its freshness date? I shudder to think about the sorts of penny pinching unsavory things that may be happening at this location.  The other subway location said it has heard so many complaints about this location and they think they intentionally want people to make the mistake of ordering from them online because it's the only way they get business. They said they could ask to have a clearer description of their location put on the site but they won't. STAY AWAY! Drive the extra five minutes to the one at Crocker or the Promenade or Center Ridge. This place is run by SCARY people with questionable business practices and all these other horrible reviews tell you the same! Run! Lol!"}
{"text":"It's a Subway....
EXACTLY like EVERY other Subway in the WORLD....
I get the same thing every time...
Tuna Salad with fixings and extra mayo...
It was very good! 
But again...Do something simple and do it right....
BINGO!!!!!"}
{"text":"Most HORRIBLE Subway sandwiches shop I've been to so far!

1) They give VERY FEW veggies. I asked for lots of tomatoes, they gave me 3 slices (by contrast, the Subway downtown near Harbord/Spadina gives 6 when I say lots). When I ask for more, they give 1 more! Also very sparse on the other veggies as well
2) I got diarrhea after eating here. After talking with some people, apparently it's got a reputation for this.

Subway sandwiches is a good place. THIS one is NOT! Go to another Subway sandwiches shop.

Only tried once, will never try again."}
{"text":"This is such a great location!! We always come in right when they are about to close (after football practice) and they never seem annoyed!!
Bradley is SUPER friendly and has been named my kids' \"FAVORITE SANDWICH ARTIST!\""}
{"text":"Just had a great experience. Sandwiches were perfect (like the promotional pictures) and best of all, the Subway literal Sandwich Artist, Stephanie. What a thoughtful, happy person with an uplifting attitude. Put a smile on my face tonight. Get a great sandwich and interaction here!"}
{"text":"This is my Subway of choice when on my lunch break at work. The only reasons I can justify writing a review for a chain that offers such unfaltering consistency are two-fold: 1. The service is always good; and 2. I really want to be the first to review a restaurant. So here it goes:

The service has always been good. The sandwich artist are always generous with the veggies and as generous as they can be with the proteins. Considering this location is in a Wal-Mart (and I cannot imagine the ignorance these guys deal with), I'm grateful that they don't smack me in the face when I ask for a side of something.

Now gimmie that star!"}
{"text":"Went here around 10:15 am and as soon as we approached the counter we were greeted warmly. However as we went down the line of order more and more people started to form a long line. Poor employee was all by herself. She was definitely hustling and was very efficient even though she was under a lot of stress and pressure. The manager definitely needs to have more employees scheduled especially considering it's a holiday weekend. She was awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in tonight to eat and the girl who was working didn't know they now have a new kind of bread for the new rueben sandwich.  She first argued with us till another employee pointed out to her that the rye bread was right behind her. Now my husband has a very expressive face and cannot hide it when he is upset about something. He did not however say a single word. Next she started to argue with him about what comes on the sandwich till the other employee once again corrected her. Then when she was topping his sandwich she started to put the wrong thing on it and my husband stopped and corrected her. Well apparently that was more than she could handle and she told my husband that he needed to \"watch\" his facial expressions.  He said I'm just shocked that you really don't know how to do your job. She than said then you can just leave! This is the subway closest to our house we eat there all the time but this was the first time ever having to deal with this girl. Very rude, untrained, with an argumentative attitude from the start. We will be contacting the manager and corporate office on Monday."}
{"text":"A dump. A dirty ghetto dump. Terrible service from a rude staff. I bought nothing. I walked out before likely catching a food borne illness from this dirty ghetto dump."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few subs to go. This is one of the best subways around. Good job Stephanie!"}
{"text":"The manager here (possibly owner) is a complete asshole. The bread wasn't cooked and was gooey all wet and he refused to re-make the sandwiches. He's a real cheap bastard. The workers seemed to be in good spirits; I have no idea why seeing who they work for. I wouldn't return to this location if you paid me!"}
{"text":"They say 24 hrs but I just walked here at 1057 and they are most definitely closed.

{"text":"Super expensive..  Nothing special about this \"circus circus\" location, if you are used to Subway. Giving one star due to the $$$$, holy cow, highway robbery, just wrong.!!!!  $29 for 2-foot longs, 1-six inch and a drink..."}
{"text":"Ridiculous(ly slow) service. 

Family and I are on the road and we're looking for a Subway. How unfortunate we were to have picked this one. Two girls were working today and one of which had looong beautiful dreads, however not wearing a hair tie or anything! Her hair was flinging everywhere over her shoulders! 

The other one didn't even bother asking us if we wanted our sandwiches toasted, just flung em in the oven. We didn't mention it to her that she didn't ask; we just let it be. 

Additionally, as we were being rung up for our four 6\" sandwiches, we gave the girl our 2 BOGO Coupons. She confusingly responded saying \"you can't use these coupons on these sandwiches.\" What??? The coupons says ANY 6\" and it doesn't expire until Aug 31. She then accepted it and took forever to ring it up. The total sounded weird because it seemed a little over-charged, but at this point we just wanted to leave.  After we saw the receipt, we were right - She charged me for a 12\" spicy Italian and then took it off as a 6\". 

Haven't tried the sandwich yet. We'll see. 

Only reason why I gave this 2 stars and not 1 is because the girl gave me extra cheese and didn't charge me extra for it."}
{"text":"I've used the online ordering system for this location 3 times. Twice they did not receive my order information. Very inconvenient when you are trying to make a quick stop before work but you have to wait because you've already paid online!! This time I felt bad for the poor kid who was working by himself and was having a busy night (as he said). Plus the fact he had to tell multiple people he was out of certain items. He seemed to handle the stress well and even though I was upset had to tell him to hang in there. Wrote a complaint to corporate...online...let's see if they get it. SMH. 

UPDATE-Response from Corporate:

My name is Meggan and I am the area director for the Subway at Vistancia in Peoria. 
I wanted to thank you for your customer care comment so we can improve our system. 

I am very sorry the last two times you have ordered from our online ordering the store has not had any record of it and it was not ready for you when you arrived. 

We have now made it to where the store receives the order on the register as well as in email.  The employees at this location will be coached on how to double check if any order was received if it does not pop up on the screen . 

Again- I am very sorry about the inconvenience of the orders not coming through. I would love if you could give our store another chance. 

Please let me know if there is else I can do for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

{"text":"This is the worst subway on earth. It's gross, the drive through is a great idea but takes an ungodly amount of time because it's ran by idiots. And they're rude as hell. 
Please subway put a drive through location near here that is not this one."}
{"text":"Ok so service-5 stars.  Gentleman greeted us right away.  Super nice and friendly.  He seemed to be the franchisee or manager.  Very friendly.

Food- 2 stars.  Bread was hard.  I did have it toasted but the bread already seemed to be over baked.  So parts of the bread were super hard and brittle.

Neat fact, this is the only Subway I have seen that feeds the homeless.  Between 3-5pm every Wednesday.  Not sure how one verifies this so as to keep the people looking handouts away, but a neat thing nonetheless.  I would be  more impressed if only they HIRED the homeless or less fortunate to give them a chance to EARN a life comeback."}
{"text":"Just look at the picture.   Bread was old and brittle.  Ruined the sandwich.  Chips were in a tight hallway on the side not visible.  It was a hot mess here today"}
{"text":"The sandwiches had a lot less greens and vegetables than I'm used to at Subways I've frequently eaten at in California. Also didn't have any avocado... Overall the sandwiches were of much poorer quality than I've come to expect from Subway."}
{"text":"I mean it's Subway.  Super clean.  1 girl working and she did a great job.  She was polite and friendly.  Didn't skimp on toppings.  We kinda joked around with her since it was slow and she looked a tad bored.  

Overall a solid Subway experience."}
{"text":"I will never go to this location again. Went in at 9:50 am, 1 person was dining at a table, no line at all, I needed 2 platters for a customer training and the guy working was not at all wanting to help. There were 2 guys working and he said he couldn't guarantee it would be ready in an hour, would try, but no guarantees. I just went to one of their competitors and they were very happy to have the business and took care of me within 15 mins of walking in and they were busy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Subway in the valley. It is near work and they know my sandwich. They are very friendly and I believe their sandwiches are better than other Subway locations. They do not skimp on the veggies and toast the bread just right. Try the Subway Melt toasted with pepper jack. Yumm."}
{"text":"Literally worst Subway I have ever been too. Bedsides not being greeted at all to waiting for some to help me. I didn't know what to do? I asked if they were still open it was about 9pm they were busy cleaning. I felt rushed uninvited. Didn't have soup either. Some employees in uniform and some not in uniform. No more Subway for me at least not this location. I just moved to Laveen!"}
{"text":"Great food from a clean location at a decent price!

Tried the sub of the day on Wednesday which was the sweet onion chicken teriyaki. For $12 I got a footlong sub plus a drink and a soup! 

Staff was very helpful and friendly. 

If you're getting a fountain soda, they have a drink machine!! I tried the vanilla mountain dew and the cherry Pepsi! Both were amazing and mixing them together is too good to miss out on! 

Would go again, rating overall is 8/10."}
{"text":"$16.35 for ONE FREEKING sandwich! Get the he-- outta here with that bs! I literally thought that she rang up TWO sandwiches but no, it was no mistake!! I couldn't believe it. I could've went to an ACTUAL restaurant for that price! I was \"expecting\" to get an affordable meal since this is fast food. Every other subway in the US charges $5-$10 for a 12\" sandwich. The cashier told me their prices are higher because they are in a casino/hotel. LOL WHAAATEVER. Talk about taking advantage of customers! I shouldn't have even paid for the da-- sandwich. DO NOT EAT HERE!!"}
{"text":"This Subway is a great addition to Mountain's Edge. It's your typical Subway that provides a healthy alternative to many of the fast food restaurants that seem to be taking over the limited commercial locations here.

The staff always says welcome and thank you as you walk in and out of the door. Most of the folks that work here are teenagers which makes it a little difficult when in a hurry. Lately I noticed their customer service has improved greatly. I hope the manager continues to make sure these kids are polite and speedy. 

Unlike many Subways I've been to they are fully stocked and never seem to run out of items which is fabulous!"}
{"text":"I like this location it's been clean every time I come in. When me and my co workers do our orders online they are always made on time and right! I have not had any issues with customer service, because every time I come in staff is welcoming and friendly. Something I usually come across subways is their bread is not as fresh and sometimes hard, but not this location their bread, vegetables, and meats are super fresh."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss with this Subway. Sometimes I receive excellent customer service and a great sandwich. Other times they are rude, don't smile, and even get your order wrong even though they are right in front of you and you have to tell them multiple times so I just give up. Their toppings and proteins seem to be fresh and have a good taste every visit, and that's a HUGE positive."}
{"text":"Spider-Man is the best thing this establishment has going. He made us feel welcome & happy to purchase our food here. Keep good employees like him around. They're hard to come by!"}
{"text":"This subway is the best everyone is very nice I love going to that subway every time I go for lunch they 2 lady's there already know what I want there very fast and nice"}
{"text":"24 hr subway. Greeted by a really nice employee.. was super generous with the veggies, and though we ordered two separate 6in sandwiches (it was the same sandwich, just different bread), was charged as only as one footlong. First time in Vegas where I finally feel like I'm coming out ahead! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Giving a one star 'cause one of the workers (Cheyenne, I believe) was flirting with my boyfriend IN FRONT OF ME. He was uncomfortable and I was obviously irritated. She was also being rude to her new coworker by saying \"Don't leave me here with him,\" to a leaving coworker. Nice job, Subway. Grade A worker. Not coming to this location again."}
{"text":"They were rude and I did NOT appreciate it. I'm now going out of my way to another Subway to avoid that kind of customer service. Step it up!!

The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because they were quick and got my order the way I wanted it."}
{"text":"This is an odd Subway, gas station combo.  The two businesses run separately, which makes it confusing when you want to make purchases from both.  
The staff at the Subway counter is probably the friendliest and most attentive I've seen in any Subway (I'm a weekly customer to locations all over the country).  Food was spot on and as fresh as is expected from this brand.
I only wish that you could purchase convince store items with my Subway purchase."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch.  I only had 20 minutes and was in and out in 15.  There was enough customers to say it was busy and the staff was great about getting everyone through the line quick.  I had my sub within 5 minutes of walking in the door.  Great place to stop for people in a hurry!  All the tables were nice and clean which was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Nice store. The lady who took my order was having a lot of conversation with her fellow employees as opposed to listening to the order.  All the tables were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  My wife doesn't like to bring food home because she would rather enjoy right after being made. We wont eat in again because we had to listen to the staff gossip and eat at a dirty table.  Food was consistent with other subways but run by children."}
{"text":"Great customer service and a quick in and out.  Ordered 2 foot longs to-go and was out the door after 5 minutes. Store was clean and I based the visit off yelp which was a good choice."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this subway numerous times and enjoyed it. It is nice on convenient because it is across from the traffic chaos in desert ridge.  My favorite would be the new apple wood pork sandwich!  Really Gwooood!"}
{"text":"I generally don't like to give negative reviews but there is a very grouchy lady who works here. I'm thinking that sadly, she may be the owner. Luckily, the other staff are nice, but she certainly didn't make my experience pleasurable. Won't be going back, sorry!"}
{"text":"You can find cheaper, better sandwiches on the block - there's a bahn mi cart up Charter before University. I went to QQ Express a few times, and while that place isn't great, it's at least moderately interesting. Even Union South has better options. I wanted to write that Subway was the mirage to UW's food desert, but it's more like drunk goggles doubling her score to six. I guess what I'm saying is that I was hungry and thought I could do it, but today I'm just regretting it."}
{"text":"Eh what can i say , its subway.  Nothing special , nothing out of the ordinary.  The employees were very nice , some of the customers were douchy , but nothing can be done about that.   Will be back w\ co workers eventually."}
{"text":"Such a friendly staff! Fresh bread and fresh ingredients. I usually get a meatball sub on white bread with extra provolone. sooo delish!"}
{"text":"????subway ,???????????????subway?6inch?????subway??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????7-8?????????????"}
{"text":"Multiple terrible experiences from the same girl. The last incident that happened was because I asked for a tiny bit more meat in my salad. Since im paying $9 for a salad with double meat and got two half scoops, I asked for a little more meat since I'm paying extra for it. She continues to ARGUE with me about how it has to be LESS than a flat scoop, (so not even a normal scoop for an extra $2) and gives me the nastiest attitude ever. I would rather give my business to dozens of other locations that don't act like a scoop of meat comes out of their paycheck."}
{"text":"Flo was amazing . Not only did she make my sub, she was very fun to talk to ! We need more employees like her !!!! No one likes a bad subway experience !!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Subway.  
I come here maybe once a week and each time the ingredients are fresh and the workers are so happy and pumped when you walk in.  At so many other Subway's i've been to they seem so glum and upset to be there.  I'm so glad this one is in my backyard and so reliable!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today. They dropped a bun on the floor and picked it up and reused it !!! euuuuh. Also, they have no customer servies experience as they talk impolitely to customers. Never going back there again!!!"}
{"text":"So I go there and try to order a chopped salad . Lo and behold this amazing interaction : one girl looks to the next and says : chipped salad ? The other one winks at her and looks at me and says : sorry we are out of salad bowls !! High school drop outs making america great again . Wonder why subway is in trouble ? It begins here . So I called corporate and their response is \" sorry , we will talk to the owners ... have a great day \" !"}
{"text":"The service here was outstanding! I work as a server and have been a retail manager and property manager so I know good or bad service. I downloaded the yelp app just to comment on this location. I really appreciate genuine service, it really made my day. Thank you subway guys so much!"}
{"text":"You know what? This Subway is awesome and I ain't even afraid to say it.

Every time I visit this location the staff is super-friendly and will even offer just the right amount of small-talk without interfering in the sandwich creation process. A lot of times I will get those 'sandwich artists' that just robotically go through the motions stone-faced and are rather skimpy with the ingredients they add to my sandwiches. Not the case here, even if you decide to show up 10 minutes before they close, which I try not to make a habit of.

When it comes to fast food chain restaurants, you are obviously going to get the same product most of the time. But here, it is just that little bit better and what separates these types of restaurants in my mind is the customer service."}
{"text":"Too expensive, slow service, not fresh. 

Price: $10.83 for a tuna foot long (no guac or extra toppings)

Service: took 1 minute before the sandwich artists stopped chatting with each other and greeted me. after the sandwich was made, it sat on the counter for another 5 minutes before one of the 3 sandwich makers checked me out for that outrageous price.

Veggies: wilting. weirdly whitish. 

Location: depressing."}
{"text":"There was no AC on a hot summer night plus there was no ice in the ice machines. The one upside is that they do accept American Express. Other than that it was subway as normal."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for the past 6 years, the clerks have always been very courteous and helpful, food is always up to par. Nothing to complain in all my time"}
{"text":"Pretty standard subway however the staff is never friendly for whatever reason. I frequent this subway fairly often and I have never had a pleasant sandwich artist."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you expect from a subway and incredibly improved over the prior franchise owner.  If you want a quick sandwich in Lebo, don't hesitate to stop."}
{"text":"Horrible. They were out of all the bread except 2 kinds. The girl made my sandwich very sloppy and put hardly any meat on it and loaded it with condiments. Regardless, I was still nice to her because she seemed like she was alone and had worked all day. Wouldn't go to this one again."}
{"text":"Hi I'm not sure of the shift leaders name but she is very rude ! She is working 10:44 p.m On dec 18, 2015. She's making shrug noises towards me and all I was asking was to compare prices with and without the drink of the meal. She's horrible service but everyone else seemed fine, she seemed really irritated. One day, she's gnna give an ugly shrug to the wrong person. Mean ass lady! This is for the subway outside of Walmart !"}
{"text":"It's 24 hours.  It has a drive-thru.  And if you feel like being less healthy, it shares space with a donut shop.  Other than that, it's a pretty standard Subway."}
{"text":"This is the worst subway ever... their bread is stale- their spinach is old and the servers are not concerned at all about the quality of the sandwich.  This is the poorest representation of this brand. 

I have been a customer of this brand for as long as they have been in Canada ... my lunch consistently."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE. Manager has multiple soups to choose from. I like that. Very customer friendly and, my sub has always been just how I like it. Been four months now and no complaints. It's time to
Compliment. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Came back to get a chopped salad. There was a gentleman in the back blasting his rap music in front of customers. Very unprofessional... plus there were two other gentlemen that were in the front who could use a little assistance."}
{"text":"MMMMmmm Nothing better than subway!!! 

its been SO long since I've had a take out sand-which.... so i swooped in real quick after a meeting today... i had a 6\" black forest ham and provolone on wheat... no dressing..with all the veggies.. and EXXTRA Banana Wax peppers.. mmmm the Best thing ever invented!!! 

Ooo and they have the best white chocolate macadamia nut cookies too :-) i think i spoiled myself today... lol 

the line was way long but the ladies behind the counter were PROs for sure. i was in and out of there with in 5 minutes!! 

Unfortunately there was a homeless person with an unpleasant odor not but a few feet from the front door... : /"}
{"text":"I never want to come back here again. Long story short, they made my sandwich right in front of me and when my boyfriend and I took our food home, his sandwich was correct but mine belonged to the man who was before me. I called to make a complaint because it wasn't mine and we had to drive a good distance away and were finally home, only to realize it wasn't my food. The girl was unapologetic, telling me to just bring the food back with my receipt and they would fix it and that was it. No sorry, no anything. We drove back to return the sandwich and they took a long time trying to find my order on their screen but I heard them mentioning the mans order before mine, and my boyfriends order after mine. They then asked me what kind of sandwich was in the bag, I told them i didn't know and they opened up and examined it, only to say \"Oh it was that man's earlier.\" They were again, unapologetic and I told them I just wanted my money back and they both went to their break area or side area to call the manager and handed me the phone. The manager was nice, he said I could get a refund and a 6in. of what I ordered and I got it, but the customer service as far as the two workers that were there was shit and I don't want to ever go to this Subway again. Very careless. The manager even told me they have four markers in the store to mark what kind of sandwich is what and it shouldn't have happened. Regardless, it was a very irritating experience."}
{"text":"Every single night, any time after 10pm... the card reader is always BROKEN and it's cash only. I'm so glad that the people that work here are so lazy. It's funny, we were there last night at the same time and there was no issues with the credit card reader. It's always the same guy with long, blonde hair that always tells us it's broken. Don't waste your time coming to this location."}
{"text":"I'd give negative stars for service didn't try the food because I couldn't get waited on. Walked in and only one employee I've been there before and the manager or owner is either too cheap or too lazy to hire help or pitch in when busy. The girl behind the counter was helping someone in the drive through which I understand but didn't look vat me, acknowledge me or say anything like hi, be with you in a few. I don't mind waiting but I do mind rude employee. She then took a second drive through customer and again didn't even look at me. After 8 minutes of being ignored I left. Either get more help or teach employees basic customer service"}
{"text":"i used to eat here all the time as a kid i recall walking from my house to eat at this subway but my opinion on the restaurant changed when i worked there i was recently employed a sandwich artist and some of the things we had to do there seemed a little off to me for example we would spray off the dates on the \"older\" meat and put on ones that were newer but on my second day i later learned that those meats (specifically the meatballs all the types of chicken ham salami and pepperoni and bacon) were actually expired and the reasoning for why we kept them to quote my manager (her name is Morning) she says if you have meat in your refrigerator and it is expired you still eat it (which i do not) so as for me i will never be eating at that subway again and also a lot of the way things are maintained there are unsanitary and unsafe for example to clean the salad bowl we actually bleach it and let it dry and i have had a problem with this process and i tried to talk to my co workers and those higher up and they say it is more \"economical\" to do this and my last fact being is that we mix the light and normal mayos so they are technically the same thing so if i were you i would think twice about eating there and if you don't believe me try getting a job there thank you all and have a great day"}
{"text":"I believe he is the manager his name is mike... Thee worst leader ever. Horrible attitude no smile looks like he's just not happy to be here, doesn't help he has looked at the clock several times like he's counting down. The other two workers have same disposition, no smile low tone when talking to customers. There's a long line and there out of salad lids white bread and Italian bread. Got to the end of line sat down and all the sudden they had white bread..."}
{"text":"Came here after hiking at north mountain...I love that this place had a drive thru so I didn't have to leave me dog in the hot car...prob will be back again!!"}
{"text":"I love to have one subway just 2 blocks from home opened 24h... It's a good option for later night food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had a horrible experience at this location. He went through the entire process of making an order just to find out that their debit card machine was not working. The employee mentioned to him that they've been having problems with the card that day but wasn't able to explain to him why she didn't say anything before he ordered nor posted any signs. He didn't have any cash on him so the employee just apologized and took the sandwich back. I'm hoping they didn't waste food by throwing it away. He left and just went to another location down the street on maryland pkwy and Sahara. The employees don't care for the place and it shows."}
{"text":"Nice service, short wait, perfect location right next to fro-yo and some shops. Nothing spectacular, but the quick wait made for easy pick-up-and-go. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"My companion and I visited this Subway location on Sunday Dec 17 2017 afternoon and the person working there (gaggan according to the receipt) was HORRIBLE! We figured she either didn't know how to do her job properly or just didn't care. Maybe it was a bit of both. It wasn't just us - we noticed an equally frustrated customer later on while we ate. The subs were good enough but the service she provided to customers was sub-par.

Examples:
-She didn't ask us if we wanted cheese. She just assumed it and placed it on.

-Even though there were two of us and we were ordering together, she took my companion's order first and completed it first. She was about to ring it up when we had to point out that I wanted to order something too. Fun tip: when there are two customers there together ask BOTH of them for their orders before ringing them up.

-She was very lazy about asking whether we wanted drinks or combos. She was just
ringing up the sandwiches only when we pointed out that we wanted combos.

-We noticed a frustrated customer later. The Subway worker came out from the back to provide
a cup of water to a different cutomer but then COMPLETELY IGNORED THE CUSTOMER WHO WAS STANDING THERE WAITING TO ORDER. The worker just went to the back and the customer had this incredulous 'What the heck?' look on her face and had to ring the bell for the worker to come out to serve her.

To the shop owners - this inept service hurts both your sales and your reputation. Your worker isn't properly selling combos so you lose $ on that. And with bad customer experiences like these, customers think twice about returning. Either train her to do her job properly to help your business or take other corrective action."}
{"text":"Beware of what you eat from here!  I ordered a meatball hoagie & the \"sandwich artist\" began scraping the container that the meatballs were in. I found that very strange being that it was 11am & you would think that they would have a brand new, full container of meatballs, definitely not the case.  The meatballs that he continued to put on the sandwich were completely shriveled in size to about a half ounce each & burnt,  obviously left in the warmer overnight. When I asked him about it he said nothing & continued to try to make the sandwich.  Absolutely disgusting. I would have posted a picture but I refused the sandwich & left.  He couldn't have cared less about the salmonella filled food he was about to serve.  Wise up management of this store before you get shut down by the health department."}
{"text":"Two high school age kids working...as soon as she finished making my sandwich and ringing me up, (receipt still left haning on the cash register) she couldn't get back to her seat on the counter fast enough to start staring at her phone again...I actually had to ask \"are we done?\" because without even a closing remark like \"Thanks, or bye\" at first I wasnt' quite sure what she was doing...then i figured out and rounded up all my stuff myself..sandwhiches were way over topped with condiments as well..."}
{"text":"Great, great service. Leslie, the store manager is nice, kind and has a lot of patience.
Jose was also great, smiling all the time. Great energy and super clean."}
{"text":"What do you want for $5? My footlong turkey sub was good, filled me up and didn't make me ill (maybe I have low expectations for $5). The staff was courteous and it was clean. I will be back when I want a quick, cheap and somewhat healthy sandwich."}
{"text":"I work downtown so I grab food here occasionally when I am looking for something quick and cheap.

I'm always in and out of here very quickly. The best thing about this specific location is the staff. I have always been greeted with smiles and friendly service!"}
{"text":"$10.99 for a footlong sub?  $14.99 for a \"premium\" footlong. 6-inch subs start at $7.49.  WTF?"}
{"text":"We ordered 48 subs for a Friday night social, condiments on the side. We were suppose to get cold cuts with cheese. There was 1small bowl of lettuce, 1 of tomatoes and 2 bowls with peppers, olives etc for the 48 sandwiches. After everyone was served the committee ate. When we opened our sandwiches there was a little round roll of cold meat with no cheese. Of course by that time there were no condiments left either. We were pretty upset and have let other future committee members know to not order from this subway again."}
{"text":"Honest truth!!! FYI! All across ontario subway restaurants still have chemical compound aka: ADA found in all the bread. such as  -- nine grain wheat, nine grain honey oat, Italian white, Italian Herbs and Cheese, Parmesan Oregano, Roasted Garlic, Sourdough and Monterrey Cheddar breads, to be precise.
If one makes the choice to eat at subway Flat bread is best sure way for alternative safe to eat. Enough said there's way to much chemicals in everday food we encounter fast food including groceries. Highly not recommend many wise food choices available elsewhere."}
{"text":"Textbook example of a great Subway experience. Friendly, quick service, fresh vegetables and perfectly cooked bread, plus crisp soda as a bonus. There's definitely a difference among Subways and this is one of the best locations in Vegas."}
{"text":"Takes forever to get a sandwich. The older woman that works in the morning (I'd post her name if I she had a name tag on) is the slowest sandwich maker I've ever seen at a subway restaurant."}
{"text":"Rather odd seeing a 5 star review for a Subway, isn't it? But these stars go to the crew and their manager. I ate here several times a week for two years when I worked on the South Side, and this place is THE MACHINE. You're in, you're out, and hey get it right. Best Subway I've ever encountered.  These folks could have schooled Henry Ford on throughput."}
{"text":"Indeed, Subway is Subway, and thus one is straight down the middle.  Competent sandwich made quickly and courteously. No major gaffs. The facility was bright and clean.  I'm giving it a fourth star because I found an extra cookie in my dessert bag!"}
{"text":"I love this location and I am glad it is close to my home. The service is always great and the food fresh and tasty, the friendly staff takes their job seriously and know how to please their customers."}
{"text":"Ok, so I know it is Vegas, but $14...$14 foot long! My friends and I sung that song all weekend...$14 dollar, $14 foot long. The pricing is NOT the same as in other cities so beware... The cheapest sandwich starts at $8. 

It was a Good Phillie cheese steak sandwich, but not worth $14. Subway, you better get your act together or else..."}
{"text":"Rude man! He would not let you use the restroom unless you are a customer never met anyone like that!"}
{"text":"The staff and the Manager Miguel are very polite and knowledgable! Hard to fine in many of the subways I have frequented. I highly recommend coming to this location. I order the feast every time! They seem to be the only location to make it right!"}
{"text":"The concept of heathy food is what brings people like me here the service is just average or below ."}
{"text":"Do not come to this location , they are more into their gossip than customer service.  They sprinkle a little of everything you ask for ... first time ever that I've seen such service.  Especially it being subway.  They have 4 girls on staff and all tables are dirty, filthy. And they don't seem pleasing at all.  They look miserable working.  Half ass everything. I rarely post negative reviews however this was just horrible."}
{"text":"When you get in the mood for a no nonsense decent sandwich at a decent price then you can always depend on a chain restaurant like Subway. You choose 6 inch or a foot, then the bread (9 grain wheat, 9 grain honey oat, Italian Herbs & Cheese or Flatbread), meat (meatball, BLT, spicy Italian, cold cut, black forest ham, oven roasted chicken), cheese (American, Monterey Cheddar), fresh veggies (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, red onions, pickles, olives, banana peppers, jalapenos), then top it off with sauce (mustard, honey mustard, sweet onion, red wine vinegar, oil, mayo, chipotle southwest, ranch). 

Everything is fresh and you can double the meat, add bacon and definitely make it a combo. My favorites are BMT and Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki. Did I say this place is open 24/7?"}
{"text":"This is a fast food joint, so I expect mediocre service. 
TWICE I have been to this location and the service is MIND blowing how slow it is!
I was there on Sunday June 5th around 4:30... The ladies before me
We're ordering ONE sandwich and the lady working was BEYOND slow. 
I don't mind having to wait, but 10 minutes for ONE sandwich? What?!? No...

I finally stormed out with no food, I was in a rush to go to work and didn't have time to wait 20 more minutes for the lady to ring up the sandwich. 

This happened the last time I went to this location too. 
I will NEVER be back.
You need to teach your staff a small sense of urgency. Some of us are in a rush, that's why we're going to a FAST food place."}
{"text":"Lyndsay is awesome! She and her friend had some good music playing and my sandwich was yum :)"}
{"text":"I have no choice because it's close by work. The staff is a who's who of crack-heads, drop-outs, and ghetto birds of all degrees of fabulousness. Efficiency is not exactly a hallmark quality of this location so best to avoid coming during the lunch rush.

If you come at any other time you can get your sandwich about as quickly as they likes of the aforementioned can muster. Once in a while they'll get someone who has their shit together and can run things efficiently. Unfortunately much like a progressive priest at my old Catholic School, they never last.

Lack of sufficient pre-planning is also apparent because one of the drawbacks of coming in after lunch time is that it's not unusual for them to be out of your preferred kind of bread (usually wheat) If the staff are busy chit-chatting in the back room you may have to wait until someone ventures out to find you waiting (wonder how many bags of chips have been lifted). 

If you work downtown you don't have a lot of options so all there is to do is deal with it. It's not God awful but it can be ghetto and I would LOVE to see the collective rap sheet of my local sandwich artists."}
{"text":"If you read my review of the Subway in downtown Phoenix, this clean, friendly, well run location is everything that the downtown location is NOT, and I mean that in the most complimentary way.

The location is clean and the staff are all friendly, clean cut and professional. I know we're talking fast food here but it's clear that the management here hold the business and it's employees to high standards. 

I don't usually write reviews on fast food places but the service I get here is so good and it is such a marked contrast to what I have to endure at lunch hour downtown, that I had to give the guys on 16th street a holler and compliment them on a job consistently well done."}
{"text":"I am slightly disappointed by this particular subway. I hardly ever give bad reviews, but hopefully this brings attention to whoever is in charge. I came in today around 2:30 and it was slow, the two kids working did not seem like they wanted to be there. When I'm ready to order I let them know and they just keep talking with each other. We had some small talk but their conversation seemed much more important. I felt rushed out of there, the gal just wrapped up my sandwich before I got to finish telling her what I wanted on it. I work in the service industry and I know how you should treat customers, I did not feel very welcomed through the whole visit."}
{"text":"It's Subway! It's probably the most food that you are going to get for $5. This subway is pretty clean and fast. It helps that it's in a rich neighborhood. Beware that it does get busy during certain hours of the day.

Are there better subs? Most likely. But not for $5."}
{"text":"I love Subway, but not this one. 

The DMV across the street has friendlier employees and that in itself should speak volumes. Like another reviewer has stated, it comes down to the sucky attitude and lack of customer service. Fortunately, Subways are like dandelions -- they're everywhere. So avoid this one.

The last couple times, I've encountered the same chick with her same LOUSY attitude. I am not going to name her, but it's the Hispanic/Indian-looking one with black hair and noticeably fake eyelashes. She's been consistently rude, so it's not situational. 

No greeting whatsoever, she doesn't know what \"extra\" means, and when you request a single line of a certain sauce, she drizzles it on purposefully. And napkins? Forget it. When you ask her for some, she'll put them on the counter instead of handing them to you. Seriously? Find another job if you hate yours so much, kiddo. Don't try to spread your clouds of misery to the customers. We just want our sandwiches, without the side of sheer incompetence and attitude. 

Now I know why this location's tip jar is practically always empty."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes in the drive thru until finally someone took my order after I got off knocked on the window and pulled up to the drive through window. After finally getting my sandwich I received the worst sandwich I've ever gotten in my life the bread was cold when I asked for it toasted and not to mention my cheese was cold and not melted one bit. They also didn't even offer a drink or to make it a meal. Worst subway I've ever been to."}
{"text":"This location has definitely turned around.  The crew of young adults who work there, was very efficient and attentive. They handle thems self professionally and worked as a team. And handled a rude customer very appropriately. I will definitely come back to this location. Also I recommend the gentleman with glasses be given a rise and promotion for his leadership skills and customer service."}
{"text":"The employees behind the counter were nice and provided good service."}
{"text":"You know what you're getting when you go to a Subway. This location is fast, clean, and gives good service for the 5 minutes you talk to them while ordering. I love Subway in general if you're in a pinch and want something healthy. They're everywhere so it shouldn't be a problem to find one, and the food is the same at all of them."}
{"text":"The bread is so dry... I had to add water from my bottle of water to make this SANDWICH bearable to eat. Basically paid 10$ for lettuce, two strips of bacon and cheese."}
{"text":"A couple of things. #1 I REALLY do not like their drive through option! Usually when you drive through it is because you are in a hurry, and want convenience. At this drive through, you have to reach out your window and touch a screen. WHAT???? On top of that, they do not offer the veggie patty on the screen, an option available inside. I also rang the help bell, and no one came, or answered. CHANGE THE DRIVE THROUGH!!!  #2 The Veggie patties. I am vegetarian, and I always try to order the veggie patty, but lately they have been \"out\", or as I was told the other day, \"They just came off the truck and are still frozen!!\" I then asked the girl to defrost one, and she did rolling her eyes along the way. If it is on the menu, they should make sure to carry it, and have it ready. Obviously, if they are running out, that means people are eating them.  Another time, we walked in and a couple of workers were talking and did not acknowledge us until we spoke up and interrupted them to get attention. They need training in customer service, and carrying items that are listed on the menu.  Once again, #1 Get rid of the drive through or change it to a true drive through, #2 Buy enough and carry what is listed on your menu."}
{"text":"Says \"OPEN 24 HOURS\"
Lol doors are locked, lights are dimmed and no one is present.
11:16PM, APRIL 24th.
What a let down."}
{"text":"I like the sandwhiches and salads but they do not have any low fat balsamic vinegrette dressing! Thats the only king of dressing i like! last time i was there i had to eat my salad without dressing and soda i had was totally flat!!"}
{"text":"Really nice group of people working here. Every time I come in, they're all pretty welcoming. The don't skimp on your meat and veggies either which is nice. Everything tastes fresh and just like it should. Quality subway right here."}
{"text":"I have never walked out of a place mid-food prep until today. I walked in and spoke to a young lady peeping from around the corner. She never greeted me back but ok she's a child so maybe and adult will come out to take care of business. Nope. Two more children come out and they joke with each other and still don't greet me. I order a veggie delight because I haven't been feeling well but needed to eat something. The bread I ordered was \"hard\" according to one young guy. So ok...the children didn't prep for the dinner rush. So I had to ask the young lady if they had spinach (both spinach and lettuce were empty). She panicked and a few minutes later, with help, she came back with spinach. I say I would like all the veggies and she literally counted spinach leaves, onions, bell peppers and when she got to the mushrooms I realized I'd still be hungry if I ate this. It looked like the amount of veggies you'd build a burger with. So I left. 

Leaving children responsible for this business is a sad starter entrepreneur mistake. Hope they get it together."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if there are new owners or not but the last time I went in there, the man was very rude because I couldn't understand what he was saying. I also mentioned that it looked as if there was a piece of mold on the bread and he said \"no\" as he picked it off the bread. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"The employees really don't feel like doing their jobs. No customer service. If you got problem don't even call the GM Zuniga. He has more excuses than they sell footlongs. Mostly taxi drivers eat there use bathroom. Not a safe place to eat. Their security is always at McDonald's.  I gave up no more this location."}
{"text":"The person making my sandwitch can't understand my request to slightly toast my bread first. Before starting the sandwitch she put on some oven mits and pulled bread out. Using same h love started making my samdwitch. I stopped her and asked if she is going to use the same hlove. Response: do you want me to change them? Well if I didn't I would not be asking. Another person just walked  up picked up the sandwitch threw it away. I decided this is not the place to eat."}
{"text":"You know what you're getting when you get subway. Today I was in a rush and they were busy. Wyatt was the one who helped me but he was knowledgeable and made it easy. There was another girl with him that was slow and he was patient but kept the line moving. I wish I kept the receipt to give him a survey. Keep up the the good work Wyatt we appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Wanted a good cheap sub. Got it... Lakesha is always here with a smile. They are super fast and always have a deal. I got the turkey sub and thhey loaded it up how I asked."}
{"text":"I walked in, no one was inside working. I waited about 10 minutes before someone peeked their head around the corner while I was on the way out to get a meal elsewhere. I figured, screw it, I'm already here. I want Subway. The Sandwich Artist finally appeared. Might as well get a sub. The guy working there was creepy but generally friendly (and also seemed high as a kite), but he honored my coupon even though they didn't technically \"accept\" them. 

I've had this happen in the past at this location where the Sandwich Artist has left the building (different guy though). I'm not sure where the manager is, but s/he doesn't seem to give a crap what goes down there."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken on oat wheat bread with all the fixins and the mexican sauce makes for a good meal, especially that January is \"Januany\" month and all foot longs are 5 dollars.  There is a steady business here and the line is quickly serviced.  When you enter you are greeted by the hard at work staff.  We ate here twice and the skill of the sandwich maker will determine your level of satisfaction.  Our first visit gave us a sandwich filled with lettuce and the greens.  Our second visit was less satisfactory.  The product is welcomed by seniors, workers and young families with children.  My only complaint is that they push the soda drinks.  Really....isn't there any other beverage other than sweeten soda fountain drinks.  For me I would like a cup of good green tea added.  Very clean and well maintained site.  I support this business.  Seating supports a group of 4 on the average."}
{"text":"Subway is and always will be a less than classy establishment because of what it is, and that's an overpriced sandwich factory filled with depressed workers who would rather be somewhere else. 

The silver lining comes when they offer a $5 footlong month and the air of overpriced bullshit goes out the window. Add in a 24 hour drive through and this location barely grazes 3 star status. Congrats Subway, you finally punched your ticket to mediocrity."}
{"text":"We came here in the morning, the lady I think her name is Mary or Marie was very nice, she suggested and took the time to grill our sandwich  which tasted amazing and even took the time to brew my tea. Other Subway restaurants tell me to shove it when i ask them if there is any more Fuze Tea."}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday evening and there was one employee, he was very attentive and when he finished helping us he was cleaning constantly. I was so impressed with how clean everything was and how kind he was to our young and messy granddaughters.  I asked if he was the owner and he was not and I was surprised. He worked like an owner."}
{"text":"I am ONLY giving one star because you all always have broccoli cheddar soup & it is clean. However today I ordered a Ice Tea & Lemonade that is brewed behind the register. As I was drinking I realized it was old and has been sitting. I brought it to the attention of an employee Shawntae she apologized and offered me a new drink and said she would check on it, the manager interjected and said \"Oh yea its old\" Why would you admit that and why as THE MANAGER would you KNOWINGLY let OLD TEA SIT OUT?! I WILL BE CALLING CORPORATE"}
{"text":"Wow. I am absolutely apalled. I went in and the gentleman and woman working,l are back behind the counter yelling at each other. I don't know if they are arguing with each other or yelling about someone else but it was loud. Then they both disappear in the back. There is no one else in the store except for me, and after about four minutes, the guy returns and asked me if I would like a \"sandwich or something\" meanwhile he is on his personal cell phone. I told him that I was wanting soup, and he nonchalantly tells me \"oh we have no soup today\"."}
{"text":"Line moves fast,  no free water.  That makes it a wash for me especially in Vegas! ;)"}
{"text":"The staff is in no way over qualified for the position of sandwich making. No personality. Additionally, they failed to put the property ingredients on the sandwich. The service provided clearly indicates the poor management at this location. Will not return."}
{"text":"I think the previous one star rating was unfair. This is a typical Subway with the same consistent sub sandwiches as any other Subway. The staff was friendly even though I walked in two minutes before closing time. The food was fresh and delicious and I have no complaints.

The facilities were very clean and well maintain to include the bathroom.

This Subway is located in historic downtown Glendale, which provides some interesting people watching inside and outside the restaurant. 

There was nothing great or bad about this Subway."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. I felt so uncomfortable when I first walked in. The girl that was working there didnt even say hi to me and wasn't very friendly. She took her sweet ass time to put some gloves on and get started on my sandwich. And by the time she was done making my food another girl that works there was standing by her taking a cookie out and eating it right in front of me like it wasn't an issue to do that in front of customers when it is VERY unprofessional. This place was terrible never eating here again."}
{"text":"I paid $10.50 for a meal plus tax. Subway prices going higher and higher, next I'm hungry I'll go for a real restaurant for that price."}
{"text":"Store empty but all tables are dirty with crumbs. And please don't wait until you are half way finished making my specialty to tell me that you don't have a key ingredient. Just disappointed overall."}
{"text":"Went there for footling Italian spicy with all the fixings. Service and food were good. No complaints."}
{"text":"This is a great Subway. Always clean, the condiments always look fresh and the area around it is always pristine. This location is really convenient for me.  This spot is never too busy and the staff is really nice and accurate with what you ask for"}
{"text":"This is literally the worst Subway I've ever been too. The service is poor and they have, in one way or another, ALWAYS gotten my order wrong. I hope they either close or restaff. And soon."}
{"text":"I have visited other subways but no one else fills my sub with so many veggies like this location."}
{"text":"After a horrible experience at another location of subway down street!  I was still craving subway.so went into this location...food was fresh! Thank u (Rodney) very polite.and can my a killer  tuna footlong! Nomnomnom!"}
{"text":"I went in on 3/21/14 Friday order 2footlongs..when I got home I took a bite of my tuna, as wife took bite of her turkey sub.and both repulsed found BLACK HAIRS IN BOTH OF OUR subs.(mind you i was wearing a hat and wife is a blonde!)went back to location.I whisper to the employee there(Jessica,was very polite).what I found in my food.i asked for a refund! I was told had to call a manager (Yvette).so I waited to find out manager told her employee, she couldn't refund my $ and she would be back on Monday and would call me then.I don't understand why it was so hard to refund me $18.16.what a joke!"}
{"text":"I like subway when I feel like a sub.  It seems like when I come here it seems to be a wait because there is always only 1 person behind the counter.  Remind me of Walmart with all the checkout lines and 3 or 4 people working them.

Rather than that the food is always good!"}
{"text":"I came in at 5:30 to order 4 foot long subs and the employee (Daniel) acted as if he had the worst job on Earth. No eye contact, no manners at all! I asked for them to be cut into thirds instead of half and he acted like it was physically impossible. I would have loved to hear \"no problem\", \" have a great night\". Not one smile. Very cold. Very rude. Get pizza next time'"}
{"text":"Very cheap edible food.  The place seems to be a little dirty and old or outdated.  It's convenient and close to my house.  I only come here in pinch"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to this Subway. I came in for the $2 - 6 inch sandwich special.  This special (cold cuts or meatball marinara) is on for the whole month of December too.  It was very quite inside. I didn't have to wait in line, so I was in and out in about 3 minutes.  The guy that served me was pleasant and I definitely will be back.  Complete the survey online and the next time you visit you will get a free cookie."}
{"text":"Improvement at this location over the last 4-5 months. Customer service is better, the stone is cleaner and the staff is friendly. The food also seems to be fresher. Good job subway!"}
{"text":"This store is clean, staff is friendly and parking lot is easy to navigate. I like the six inch veggie delight in wheat. Bread is fresh, veggies are never old. Sandwiches made with love at this location!"}
{"text":"Wasn't busy, went through the drive through as I had my dog with me. Super awkward window attendant. Ordered a six inch tuna on wheat. She asked what vegetables I told her all of the vegetables except jalapeños and banana peppers, she then goes \"so just jalapeños and banana peppers do you want any other vegetables\". I politely said no jalapeños or banana peppers but all of the other vegetables are fine. She says \"oh alright\" anyways I get my sandwich and there is both jalapeños and banana peppers on it. Truly doesn't mater, I can pick them off but what an awkward weird experience. If I ever come back to this location again I will make a point to go inside so I can watch what gets put on the sandwich."}
{"text":"Best Subway in the area for sure! The people are always nice there, and they make sure your sandwich is made perfectly. Fresh ingredients, fast and friendly service, and convenience."}
{"text":"Very fast and polite people. Sandwich is really yummy.

Better cashier this time. Last one must've just had a bad day."}
{"text":"Sub par but acceptable quality, very slow service in my experience. The vegetables used do not seem dense at all and literally break apart like wet sand with the onset of some pressure. This is not unique to this location, it is evident at many subways and is a result of the suppliers product, not the original restaurants. 

The meat, chicken breast, steak, is all pretty decent, although I cant help but wonder about production methods and preservatives... 

The bread was on par this visit. The Sandwich artist however did not seem too interested in being quick with my steak and cheese sub, it took about 4 minutes to do the sandwich I ordered. The sandwich construction was quite decent, Although I was given much more then \"A single strip\" of ranch dressing like I had asked for, using an accompanying hand gesture to get the point across. 

None the less, a subway with good quality product and fast service could only really score a 3 and a half at most because the quality of the food is simply not as good as a restaurant that serves USDA prime steak, a type of food that is rated much higher compared to vegetables that are sliced thin and frequently not crisp. 

But still, I will continue to eat at subway becuase the cost is good, the food is generally consistent between locations, and its pretty healthy."}
{"text":"For a fast food chain known for it's homogeneous franchise structure, there couldn't be much more inconsistency in the customer service.  I've been a long time fan of Subway and live close to this location.  Unfortunately, they have repeatedly let me down.

The most recent offense - the dreaded curly long black hair that had to be pulled out of my mouth.  Needless to say, this ruined my appetite.  But...these things happen and as long as the restaurant makes up for it, I will typically let it slide.  So, I called the location and told them about my sandwich with a little something extra.  They said they'd call me back after speaking with the store manager.  I received a call several minutes later and was informed that I could bring in what I had left of the sandwich and they would remake or refund me for however much is left.  I ordered a footlong and discovered the hair in the last quarter of the sandwich, which meant only a partial reimbursement for a miserable experience.  I was infuriated and swore at the poor girl on the phone.  She passed the buck to her manager and said that he'd give me a call to discuss this further.  Yeah right....how about I just let the YELP* world decide on this poorly managed Subway's fate?"}
{"text":"Just like every other Subway on earth, this place has all of the above! While we all know what Subway's deal is about, I like this location because it's rarely busy and has convenient parking right out front. The staff are friendly and helpful, and they have a full menu. What more could you want from your local Subway!?"}
{"text":"It's alright. They were pretty stingy with my friend's sandwich. The lady was super slow and the other guy there was just chilling in the back room. The lady said \"Welcome to Sonic\" to a bunch of elder people walking in. Will probably come back. This place doesn't ruin Subway for me."}
{"text":"By far my favourite Subway! Their tables are always clean, as are the windows. They always have what I want to order. 

Sometimes they run out of bread, and sometimes the worker's friendliness isn't the best, but overall it's a great place for me and a couple friends to hang out."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I went to subway went to this subway on Higley it didn't matter the mid range priced subs or the premium they were both all full of bread and really not very good"}
{"text":"Christian (Male) is the best!! He's always friendly and he always prepare my food with care!! Thanks Christian!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food. They are kind, friendly and welcoming. The dining room was clean. I enjoyed the down to earth, honest staff,  that have make my family's wonderful subs."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this 4 stars, because it is a chain.  The service here seems to be pretty good, and whenever I've been there they seem to have fresh veggies (unlike the Subway on Lichtfield and Bell)."}
{"text":"I have been to this subway a bunch of times, and it seems that they never have fresh veggies.  The lettuce always has some red on it, the tomatoes are slimy, and I'm never sure about the rest of it.  There are other subways in the area, the one on Waddell and Lichtfield being much better.  Whenever I go there, if something doesn't look fresh, they toss it."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest Subway I've ever been to, and this consistently clean. The staff is usually local high school kids, they're always polite and quick on the spot. 
Did I mention how clean it is here!? It makes me want to come back again and again just because I trust the back of house is the same as front of house. Thank you Subway! Take note of this fine location."}
{"text":"They're open 24 hours and that's a plus. The neighborhood is not so great, so I would not recommend coming here in the wee hours of the morning. It is a small subway not regulation size and generally they only have one person working the counter. This of course is a hassle when there gets to be more than one person waiting in line. Overall it was good, can't go wrong with the Subway."}
{"text":"Same experience like everybody else , employee is rude. Rushing orders while nobody else in here. They acted like they don't care.   At 8:15am, ice tea is still not ready.  Not all subways are the same.  Go to another one nearby."}
{"text":"Ok bare with me as I know reviewing Subway is like reviewing Taco Bell.  I'm simply reviewing to let anyone aware to avoid this one....or more likely when a dark haired kid is working.  I go in and order a sweet onion chicken sandwich....kid asks me \"do you want this toasted?\"  I said no thanks (toasting it makes the break funky and brittle)....so the kid takes the two paper boats of  cold chicken and instead of heating them up, just dumps them right on the bread.  As he is putting the cheese on the cold chicken I asked him if he was going to warm the chicken...\"but you didnt want it toasted\" he replies.  I asked if he was going to heat it in the microwave and he turned to a female co-worker and asked if the microwave was still broke.  As she was getting bacon out of the same microwave, she said it was broken.  I then asked why was she cooking bacon in a broken microwave and he replied \"it overcooks things\".  

Okay, so he toasts it for a second and then puts the veggies on....3 black olives...i ask for more so he generously puts on 4-5 more.  I tell him no oil & vinegar and just vinegar.....well he messed that up too.  I was too damn hungry and too exhausted to walk out or demand the kid make another one so I just shook my head and paid and went home to eat my luke warm chicken mess"}
{"text":"I work around the corner and go here sometimes for a quick lunch. I've never had a problem here until today. I walk in, order my flat bread, sit down and BAM! In my sandwich is a HUGE grasshopper just jammed in there with the head popping out! I didn't freak out outwardly just calmly walked over to the cashier and showed her my sandwich. She joked that it's just a \"little extra protein\" but would make me a new sandwich. News flash...this is AMERICA, nobody wants to eat that kind of \"protein\" at Subway! My stomach is still hurting from the sight and for my trouble was offered \"2 free cookies\". Great, thanks. All in all, I will never come back and probably would never eat at Subway again!"}
{"text":"If I have the right subway it's the one with the drive thru by Home Depot and I gotta say that drive thru saved me and my boyfriends lives when doing our home over a mile away. We went through it everyday for 2 weeks straight as we were getting crap from Home Depot! The girl in the drive thru with the glasses and the bubbly voice was probably the nicest women I've ever encountered she even gave me and my bf a complement on how cute we were together. It was really cool to see someone with such enthusiasm and so friendly to be working a drive thru :)"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. This is one of my favorite subway. I love the packaged cookies for sale."}
{"text":"We had the great pleasure of meeting Ron at this location. He saved the reputation of this place. We'd been here before and the service was not anything to write home about. Ron was caring, down to earth and made our day brighter. He was all smiles and our orders were made to perfection! We LOVED him! If you'd had horrible service here before, go back when Ron is working and you will wonder why he wasn't there the many times before! We love you Ron and your sandwhiches were phenomenal! We will certainly be letting corporate know how valuable you are to this brand and location! 15/10 on delightful, professional and perfection of customer service!"}
{"text":"This is officially the second day I'm dealing with food poisoning from this Subway.  I've never gotten this sick from eating somewhere.  I ordered a turkey chopped salad on Wednesday evening and have been suffering the consequences since the following morning.  There was one woman and one young man working at the time. The young man was friendly enough but the woman was rude and messy.  Instead of asking what I would like on my salad, she repeatedly said \"what do you need\". She put onions and bell peppers on it without asking if I'd like them (or if I \"needed\" them as she probably would've said) and she was very rushed,  when there was only one other person in line. I often go to Subway and I have even been to this location before, but I will NEVER go back now.

Sincerely,
Food poisoned in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time blonde goth-girl was flirting with a group of boys who were sitting at a table.  After I had been standing there for 3-4 minutes she came around to the \"make me a sammich\" side and started adjusting her hat, tucking her unkept hair inside the the security of her visor. While doing this she asks me what kind of sandwich I would like,  all the while looking sideways and smiling at the boys. I paused before answering,  hoping her next move would be to put on gloves before touching my food. Since my hopes were  fulfilled, I gave her my order and she proceeded to carry out her sandwich duties. One of the boys walked up and she immediately  pushed my sandwich to the side and began a conversation with this guy about her choir concert (This girl is in high school when she's got tattoos and piercings!!??) My sandwich is finished by a different  employee who was far less charismatic. Asked myself, \"Who would hire these two?\" And better question yet, \"Does their boss know how unprofessional these two perform?\"
Second visit was about a week later when my son needed something to eat quickly. Ran in here and the goth girl was there but cleaning. Noisily. You know the kind of sweeping where they are knocking every  table and chair leg and it makes the kind of noise that makes you flinch. The guy behind the counter was apparently annoyed at yet another customer because he said \"Welcome to Subway.\" without looking up, and a tone and pace that sounded sleepy and uninterested. No real sincerity to his words.  He threw the bread down like a child pouting, slapped on the items I asked of him,  and honestly was taking out his disdain for his day, his job, everything, on my poor sandwich. Once again I thought,  \"Who would hire these people?\"
Well, I won't be back.  Not only is it subpar  but I hate feeling this way about young ppl today. Where's  the pride in earning  money? Where's the customer service? Whatever you are in life (Sandwich Artist, included), Be a good one. These employees are only good at getting rid of customers."}
{"text":"We've ate here once.  The food was the typical Subway and nothing more.  The location was relatively clean with very polite almost English speaking staff.

The store itself was empty --just us on a Saturday around 12:30pm (Still unsure what that says about the store)

Overall is wasn't bad --nor amazing.  After all, it's a Subway, right, how big can expectations be?

I will eat at this location again."}
{"text":"I'm one who likes to review restaurants I've eaten at but I somehow forget to write about fast food places. I visited Subway after getting out late from work (7pm is late for me). Mind you I'm tired and hungry or should I say hangry. Well Julya at Subway was such a pleasant young girl. She made me feel comfortable and brought me out of my comfort zone cause I really just don't feel comfortable talking to people I don't know. Very nice girl. By the way, the new multigrain flatbread was a good recommendation from her. I loved the taste of the flatbread. Thank you Julya for making me feel welcomed and feeling better cause only God knows I have so much on my mind lately! Sometimes that's just what a person needs! Subway, you hired the right person!"}
{"text":"Subway is subway. You've been to one, you've been to them all.

I like a cheese sandwich, and although they offer tons of toppings, I hate that they charge you for extra cheese when they only use 2 slices for a cheese sandwich. Oh well. Still pretty tasty though!"}
{"text":"Ok, all those bad reviews are very old and not up to date. I have no idea why they ripped off this subway. I just went in, first time visit, and this was an amazing subway visit!!!! 

They were very nice, accommodated me and my large order, very respectful, and fun to talk to. Great energy here, conveniently located next to Starbucks, easy to get in and out of. 


Forget the old reviews, they're not true, and go to this Subway, they're great! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Super obvious the employee/s don't want to be there. I was the only one in line and service was super slow. 1 guy working and wouldn't stop telling me all the meat was 50% fake and contained pork. Bacon contains pork? I will not go back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service every worker has a unfriendly attitude like they dread there job, nor do they wipe there tables often, would definitely reccomend a different subway."}
{"text":"Rip off. The manager of the place overcharges customers hoping they wont notice. I added a drink and chips on and they tried to tack on 4 dollars thinking I wouldn't notice. Not happening again, because I'm never going back again."}
{"text":"This Subway is on the way to a friend's house we go to just about every weekend for band practice.
Eh, it's Subway. They make the sandwich, you watch, it's good. The gals there are entertaining.
A guy walked in behind us with a Yankees ball cap and shirt on, and one of the gals asked if he was a fan. His response, \"No. I just like the colors.\" One of those \"Here's your sign,\" moments. Priceless. :)"}
{"text":"Grossed out.  Rude workers.  They were joking about accidentally baking a piece of bacon into one of loaves of bread and how vegetarians wouldn't like it.  I'm vegetarian, and no, I would not like a piece of pig baked in to my bread.  Thanks."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location of Subway off and on for a couple of years. It is conveniently located near CCAC. During my most recent visit, I ordered a 6\" sub with a free cup of water. The line moved fairly fast during lunch. The staff did not have English as their first language, and they spoke quietly, so I had some difficulty with understanding them, but my order was made properly. The sub tasted good. The restaurant has a few rows of small tables at which you can eat."}
{"text":"We love stopping at this Subway before going to Seastrand park. It is perfect for a picnic in the park!
The store is clean and the staff is friendly. 
I do have trouble finding parking sometimes.

Try the cookies!!!"}
{"text":"The food here tastes like all the other Subways I've been to but the service is painfully slow. If I'm the only customer there it shouldn't take 15 minutes to make a cold sub. This place takes the \"fast\" out of \"fast food.\""}
{"text":"This is the best Subway location in Las Vegas. The staff is always friendly and right there waiting to help you and the line really moves along quick. Don't be surprised if you see a long line upon entering but like I said it moves quick

The veggies are so fresh. 

I asked for extra cheese twice and didn't even get charged. The store is so clean you could literally eat off the floor.

There isn't much more to say but try this location!"}
{"text":"Subway for lunch at just $5?!?! You bet!

The staff was very friendly the store was very clean and the sandwich was very good."}
{"text":"While I was waiting in the long line over at Reef, hubby and I got hungry, so I decided to walk through the parking lot and grab something from here at Subway. This location is open 24/7 and I came in a little bit after midnight. Nobody was visible at first and then a guy came from the back and took my order. He said he's not usually very busy really late at night, so I let him know that plenty of people in line from Reef will probably come over. He then stopped making my sandwich and went outside to look at the line across the parking lot leaving me alone inside. WTF?! lol. He then comes back inside saying \"damn I'm gonna be slammed tonight\" and I said yep probably lol. He was trying to push for my sandwich to be toasted and I kindly explained that I didn't want it. When I did go to eat my sandwich the bread wasn't fresh and stale which is why I am assuming he was trying push it being toasted so I wouldn't know it was crunchy already. I asked for extra mayo and mustard and didn't get it. By the time I added chips and a drink my total was $10.66 which is way too pricey for what I got. For that price I'd rather have Capriotti's personally."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Went there Sunday at noon and only 1 employee was working!  Also,  out of numerous things.  This place is managed very poorly!"}
{"text":"I walked in and no one greeted me... Probably didn't know I was even inside. After I ordered my sandwich, I asked the employee helping me, Carissa, for 6 cookies. It must've been too much to ask for because she tossed the cookies at me. I politely asked for a bag to put them in and she angrily put the cookies in the bag then shoved the bag towards me like \"here, get out of here\"... After I paid I kindly asked for her name, and I promised never to come to this subway on pinnacle peak EVER again."}
{"text":"I've only been to this particular store once, but my visit was great.  Service was excellent.  When we asked if we could have more napkins, I  believe his name was Jason, said \"sure\" and when he saw me getting ready to stand, he told me not to move that he would bring them to us.  At this particular time, I was in a lot of pain with my legs and feet, so that was music to my ears!!  And he didm't even know I was in pain, he was just a gentleman!!  That was refreshing!  In addition to the service, our food was delicious, as usual.  I've never eaten anything I didn't like from Subway."}
{"text":"I have been to many Subways and this one was terrible. I stopped in on Sunday for a quick lunch and it all went downhill from there. First off the lady behind the counter had no personality (If you hate your job so much, then quit) No greeting. She made me a Meatball sub and just clumped them on the bread (not lined up) so it ending up being a soggy mess to eat.
The music on the speakers kept cutting out and was driving me nuts! Fix it or turn it off. Then the whole time I was eating the two ladies working there starting to clean the floor very loudly.
I ate my messy sub and left as soon as I could!"}
{"text":"The food and staff here are always top notch, but have to say it looked like the dining area hadn't been cleaned in a week. The counter was dirty with crumbs that the employees had brushed over to the customer's side, the tables were dirty even though I was the only guest in there at the time and e floors needed sweeping AND mopping. 
Someone's not paying attention and rather than blame employees making minimum wage, I would have to say it's the owner's fault for not taking enough of an active leadership role. Clean the place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Subway! The people here are always so nice. James that works here is super helpful and makes great sandwiches."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to leave a review but this experience was probably the worst I've ever had here. I was served by a girl Taree when first asked what her name was she said Tarala or Tarada anyways this girl was smacking our food around apparently very angry and/or frustrated for God knows what but she felt the need to take it out on me and my boyfriend. I asked this girl if she rather we wait for another colleague since she's obviously not in a good mood and she said no it was fine and continues to smack and throw our food around so much to where my sandwich's wrapper is torn. 
She must be new I've been coming here for a year now never had a complaint for someone other than her. The district manager, Edgar Enciso will be advised."}
{"text":"I used to work at subway and I am very picky about my sandwiches, unfortunately. This subway is one of the only ones that makes appetizing sandwiches. They were a little distracted when I went but my sandwich was perfect and thats all that masters to me! Kudos!"}
{"text":"I come here once a week and it's never open at 7:00. I get here around 7:15 each time and the door is still locked. Lights on, door locked. Wtf"}
{"text":"Superior Service!  The ingredients are always fresh.  I had to write a review because the service is always amazing.  I know this is totally quarky, but I am so appreciative that they keep things sanitary.  They are always cleaning up the station, measuring the food temperature, AND when asked for the bathroom key they will finish making your sandwiche before handing the key to someone!"}
{"text":"Great service . Fresh bread and friendly staff . I always get the turkey sub with all veggies except lettuce along with oil and red vinaigrette topped with little Parma cheese."}
{"text":"It seems that everytime i go there tables are not wiped down. There always leftovers from previews custumers.  The one in 36st and mcdwell much better one. They even have free wifi!"}
{"text":"Sat at the drive through for 5 minutes before anyone took our order. We were the only one in line. Nobody answered the mic so we had to go up to the window and knock. Then waited another few minutes. Don't have a drive trough if it's too much for you to handle. 

1 star for being inconsistent. It's customer service. Get it right or quit your job.

The inside is good and would rate 5 stars. Why not..."}
{"text":"Great tuna. I order for pick up. Manager was great took my order. Had sandwiches ready when I arrived. Since I had been ill and wanted takeout I appreciated his fast service. Terri S    Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I don't usually review franchises as I'm sure everyone's been to a Subway before and knows what they're getting.

But holy-cheapness, this location is skiimppy on the toppings! If you go during peak times expect to ask 4 or 5 times to add more (lettuce, then tomato, then onion, then green peppers, then jalapeno's)... I woulda thought they'd had it when I'd asked 5 times for more onion already!! Two strands isn't gonna cut it!

Plus forget about being able to get food properly, the space is so small you'll be elbowed and shoved and hit with the door before you'll be able to get out (let alone wait around to grab one of the 10 seats)."}
{"text":"Love this location! Close to work, easy to find and there's always a parking space. In and out quick and easy!"}
{"text":"Great spot for the midnight sub. Conner was super friendly and made a great sandwich."}
{"text":"This is currently our nearest Subway location.  It's new, so it's clean.  (Hopefully it stays that way).  There is an abundance of training.  The staff may need more training, as they seemed confused about my order.  It seems I'm not having good luck ordering at fast food places these days.  The gentleman also couldn't confirm the address.

They are stingy with avocado, if you are ordering it."}
{"text":"I was in subway Friday. The sandwich artist's were very nice. They even let me use a coupon the day before it was even  valid.!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worse subway in the area. DO NOT EAT HERE! Customer service sucks big time, none of the ppl here speak English, employees are very rude and disrespectful towards customers. I will NEVER step foot in this place ever again"}
{"text":"I agree with the previous reviews. Just had the worst experience at the subway at val vista and southern and refuse to ever go back there. The employee refused to make.my salad saying I couldn't make that sub a salad. It says specifically that u can make any sub a salad for 6.00. The guy tried charging me extra for it and when questioned he said he had to charge me extra and that's the way the system was. He opened the drawer and literally threw the upcharge at me! I told him I wanted the managers name. They gave me a number but doesn't look like I'll be getting any responses from them. I decided I didnt want the salad after all he THREW THE MONEY at me. He refunded it and I went down the street to val vista and baseline...awesome salad and customer service there!!!!"}
{"text":"I work a few feet from this Subway.  I always walk about five minutes and go to the Subway at the Consol instead.    This particular Subway on Forbes avenue sits on the Duquesne university campus.  I always feel uncomfortable going to this particular Subway because of the attitudes that I often get from them employees.  Once I got yelled at when I asked if I could substitute a pop / soda instead of a milk for a kids meal.  The employee yelled at me and my nephew screaming and slamming a milk in his hands. He said loudly \"No!!  Juice.   juice juice or milk milk milk!!!!;\"   often I realize that the employees laugh and talk in a foreign language in front of customers. I fully understand if you cannot substitute items but don't scream and yell if the customer is being respectful and just asking.  Also they put tons of mustard on my sandwiches when I also say very little."}
{"text":"This Subway is definitely the best Subway that I have ever been too.  The first time you walk through the doors you are a guest.  The next time you are family.   I work closer to another Subway but always walk a few extra minutes to come to Subway  in the Consol Energy Center.  All the employees here are so sweet, kind, and go out of their way to make sure your order is perfect.  The manager Tara is the nicest lady.  Whenever I am having a bad day at work, just her warm welcoming and greeting make me feel better.  She definitely is a great asset to this Subway"}
{"text":"I'm not a big chain food fan and don't go to Subway much but I was sitting at a table eating the cupcake I had just bought at Altura to satisfy my sweet tooth and saw the Subway sandwich place across from me. I looked it up on Yelp to see if there were any pictures posted for it yet. What I found was it there was no listing for it at all so I walked up to get a to-go menu that might give the address and hours, and talk to the employees. 

I decided that the sweetness of the cupcake made me crave something salty and I remembered that they had very inexpensive breakfast sandwiches, so I ordered a cup of the loaded potato soup to eat right there and a two dollar Breakfast Sandwich to take back to my motel room for the next morning. Then I took a few pictures. 

The soup was very thick and hearty but tasted like it might have been made from a mix, a bit salty snd full of chunks of ham and bacon. The surprising thing was when I reheated the breakfast sandwich for about 45 seconds in the microwave in my motel room the next morning this morning it was extremely good and I was really glad I had gotten it. 

I found the employees to be pleasant and helpful and I think I would go back there again if for nothing else than another breakfast sandwich. You can't get much cheaper than $2 for something that tastes that good."}
{"text":"Staff were completely uninterested. Bread was kinda soggy (on the outside) like it was close to something steaming, and one of the cucumbers were moldy/rotten. Won't be going back. EVER."}
{"text":"Overpriced since it's the strip, but it's my go-to option when I want quick non-fried food. They are open 24 hours but obviously it might be a little slow in the middle of the night (like, 2-3am) since they only have one person or two working."}
{"text":"We came to eat on a Friday they were out of steak they had to go and get new roast beef because I wanted a roast beef sandwich and it looked very slimy.  so I opted for the spicy Italian which was decent. 

I do think that their fridge or whatever it is that they put the food in as you're picking what you want is too cold, because everything seem to have frostbite on it which also led me to believe that it is not actually as fresh as subways have you believe.  

I ate my sandwich and it was okay but I will never go back there again based on the frost bite. I would strongly suggest that they adjust the actual freshness of their food."}
{"text":"Ew. 

The only sub worth getting here is the meatball. Even then, just go 'round the corner to Jersey Mike's and get yourself a sub with fresh ingredients. Where they don't stiff you on the extra veggies."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Tod was so eager to get the the next person. Get started our order however never finished. He passed us a long to a girl who looked like she didn't know what she was doing. She couldn't figure out if there was enough soup even as she was looking in the container. This place is a horrible subways. I'd drive another mile down the street just to get better service. Lastly, you don't call your customers \"bro\". Horrible place!!"}
{"text":"This subway this relatively near me so I stop by for a quick meal on my way home. A sub is a sub pretty much so I can't complain about a sandwich. What I will complain about is the cleanliness of the store. And how the employees handle making your sandwiches with the same gloves as they open doors. Scrape food off the counters. Pick up different items from different areas of the place. Just change your gloves. I'm sure they're not that expensive. I hate when you open the freezer door to get more condiments out and return to making my sandwich with the same gloves you touch dirty doors with. Ewe it drives me nuts. But because of that I won't be going back. And it's ok when you're not busy to clean up around the food area. It's not a good look to have food all over the containers you keep supposedly fresh food in."}
{"text":"I went to this location today during my lunch break. When I entered I was greeted by the staff. Their greeting was probably the worst I have ever received from walking into a Subway. It seemed very forced, with no heart, and extremely unwelcoming. I only got the impression that they hated having to greet guest and thought it would have been a lot more pleasant if they hadn't said anything at all. Either than their half hearted greeting, the staff was nice. The girl that made my sub did an excellent job. The taste of food was alright, typical cheap Subway quality. The store was very clean! Overall, my experience was alright. Would have gave 4 stars if their greeting wasn't so weak."}
{"text":"\"Four stars, really? I mean it's a SUBWAY.\"
But, hey, in a city where it might as well cost money to breathe, the 5 Dollar Footlong deal is clutch, especially since they're open 24/7.  It'll keep you on a budget without having to eat McChickens and Small Fries the whole time you're in town."}
{"text":"Brought in a coupon for a free 6\" sub with the purchase of one of equal or greater value. I decided to get a footlong for me and the six inch for my son. I feel totally ripped off. They said in order to use the coupon they would have to ring it in as 3 separate six inch subs because the computer wouldn't recognize the coupon with a footlong. So in the end I ended up paying more for the 2 six inch sandwiches than I would have if I had just paid for my footlong and a six inch. Totally bugged!"}
{"text":"Worst Subway Ever!!
I have ordered online salad at this store for pickup and on multiple occasions they missed to add chicken in a double chicken salad and the quantity of is not even 1/4 of the box they pack it in. 

Never going here again!!"}
{"text":"So far so good!  I think I will continue to drive the extra mile and come to this one, instead of the S LV BLVD store!"}
{"text":"It's Subway!  Sandwiches at a reasonable price!  No complaints!"}
{"text":"This subway gives military discounts!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Subway Club with lettuce tomatoes and mayonnaise and I had to explain to the guy making the sandwich 3 times what I wanted on it. Then my sons ordered a meatball sub and the guy kept insisting on it being toasted even after we humbly declined. Finally they got the order right after after 10 minutes of explanation.  The manager did however give us a free upgrade to a combo meal because of the incompetence of his sandwich maker."}
{"text":"The only subway I will go to from now on . You don't have to ask to \"hook it up\" with veggies and dressings like you have to constantly ask for at the Maryland location down the street ! And the staff is FRIENDLY HERE ! food is always fresh and the bread is sooooo soft !"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this subway is horrible . Use to be great but now all that works there are teenagers with additudes. I never had to ask for \"more onions, more mustard , more more more .....\" they are so skimpy on EVERYTHING . And every time you ask for more they just get irritated , I basically gave them directions on how to make a proper sandwich because they don't know how! It's not that hard to make a sandwhich !!!!! . Will take my Business down the street to the burmuda and windmill location from now on."}
{"text":"There has been many incidents at this subway. For one they are suppose to close at 10pm, why is it that twice that I went around 9:45pm they already have their lights off and the doors are locked. This time I went around 9:50 yes 10 minutes before they close and that's why I was going to tip them $10 because I felt bad for coming in so last minute. I told the girl I wanted a combo which means \"sandwich, drink, & chips\" tell me why at the end when I get done paying I had asked for my cup and she told me \"you didn't get a meal\" with attitude! If I'm not mistaken a combo is the same thing as a meal and it should've came with a drink. Already upset that while she was making my sandwich her and her co worker were making snobby faces and rolling her eyes. For the two young girls working the night shift on April 12th, 2018. You girls need to smile more and change your attitude when it comes to last minute customers because we do feel bad and sometimes may even tip more than you think."}
{"text":"I like Subway all around, and this is a good location.  During lunch and dinner rushes the place can get really packed, so I generally try to avoid those times if possible.  Service is always fast and friendly.  Since there's so much traffic you know everything is rotated and fresh.  Pretty easy location to get in and out of."}
{"text":"Employees were very fast and friendly, place was nice and clean as well. Will definitely return! Location is on a busy corner."}
{"text":"Just visited subway on freedom as the young lady was fixing my sandwich a bug flew on the bread. I brought it to the young ladies attention, she was like oh took the bread and put it back in the warming cabinet with the other bread and got me another one.   Not cool. That was"}
{"text":"Horrible the manager is weird and the employees don't put enough on the sandwich and most of them are weird. I recently went when they got their windows smashed so obviously someone doesn't like them."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a subway. 30+ minutes for one sandwich. I have strange food allergies and normally have zero issues. But the employee sat my sandwich on a random, old piece of paper (from a different customer so gross) and I had to tell him to make it again because my allergens were all over it. Which didn't make him very happy. No apology. Nothing. He was so shocked. Sorry if I don't want to eat something I am allergic to!! Just don't go to this location."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give negative Stars, that is what I would give this location. The lady with the green hair gave horrible service. I was very disappointed and I will not spend my hard-earned money at this location ever again. I don't know if it was because of the color of my skin or what, but it took me about 15 minutes before anybody even took my order. My total visit was almost a half an hour between waiting to be helped, getting my sandwiches made and paid for and leaving. Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Eh...whatever.  I mean it's Subway, what do you expect?  The service was okay.  Just like every other Subway, when I left I smelled like yeast and bread the rest of the day which I know sounds rediculous but it drives me crazy!

Subway is great if you want a sub with crappy bread, that may or may not be hard on the bottom, mediocre meat and cheese with basically unlimited veggies.  It is nice that you can add just about any topping for free.  This is the only edge Subway has on any of the other sub places.

Subway used to be one of the only chain style sub shops around but with all the new options I'm surprised they are still around.  They are my last choice for a sub, and I will only return if I'm in a pinch."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Subway in Pittsburgh. Anyone giving this place less than 5 stars has not been to other Subways around the city, which are AWFUL. They pile on the vegetables and cheese here and their food seems to be of higher quality. I had a coupon from the entertainment book for buy 1 foot-long, get one free. But, I didn't realize that this location only had the coupon for the six-inch. A young man who I believe is the manager gave it to me anyway. Great customer service !"}
{"text":"I'm horribly dissatisfied with the subway I went in  on national sandwich day. It was explained to me that my 6 inch sandwich cost for 425 and then dish and a 6 inch sandwich would be free I was then charge 649 because he said I didn't buy a drink which he did not explain to me in the beginning of the process otherwise I would not of bought the sandwich this is not only happen to me it's happened several people throughout the day that I have talk to you and it should be called national rip off day by subway if they're not going to explain to you in the beginning and give me the chance to walk out I will no longer shop at the Subway or any other subway there are plenty of other sandwich shops Close to me and I will do everything I can to make sure that nobody that I know goes to the subways again. If you advertise it as a free sandwich for the price of a sandwich that's what it should be all the commercials are very false advertising"}
{"text":"Umm they pretty much had me sold on the simple fact that they're open 24/hours... Being a VIP Host in Vegas that's like super legit because we work ridiculous hours and we're always hungry! Lol"}
{"text":"Food tasted ok. The establishment was pretty dirty. They didn't accept my coupon because they weren't a 'participating location' which made me feel very cheated. They should at least put a sign up saying they don't accept coupons instead of letting me make my order then tell me it's not accepted there. I don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"This Subway handling of the lunch rush was average.  The wait time on one day was a few minutes, but 10-15 on another day.  They were losing business as people walked out when they saw the line.  

This location doesn't take Subway frequent buyer cards.  Boo!

This is a fine Subway to go to, but not one of the best in the franchise"}
{"text":"As we walked in, the employee was on his cell phone, even though all the tables and seats were dirty and needed to be cleaned, and he took a long time to get off and go to the back for a while. He didn't come to the handwashing station and wash his hands and we didn't hear running water so i have no idea what took him so long.  This didn't bother us THAT much, except i did see there were wrapped utensils directly under a hand soap dispenser, which is also a health code violation.... 

Everything else was fine until we were paying for our food.  I asked the cashier if I could use a 21 oz cup just for ice. He simply said yes, not \"you still have to pay the soda price\" or \"the water cups are the only ones that are free\", just \"yes\".  He then proceeded to charge me for a soda that i was not getting, and then didn't offer a receipt.  After a while i realized everything didn't add up to what i actually paid, meaning i paid more than i should have.  So we asked for a receipt to verify the price, and we finally saw what had happened. He started to argue and talk over me about the situation, causing me to raise my voice to be heard. All i wanted was my $1.60 back for being charged for something that I WAS NOT AWARE OF BEING CHARGED. This took about 5 minutes before he finally refunded the money, and proceeded to be rude and argue more and insult me as he did so."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight and food was good. Nothing overly special but what I expected. Service/professionalism was another thing. There was one guy baking bread and he seemed to be more pleasing of the two but that is not saying much. The younger guy working was a different story. He spoke to himself a lot or maybe to his co worker but clearly not me. He was using profanity because they were out of some vegetables and then as I paid he mumbled \"cookies tonight?\" Again never looking at me. While I watched he made fun of another lady for picking up the wrong drink from the cool. He made comments like \" I charged her for apple juice and she got a juice box oh well not my money\"  and once the line was done he was speaking to his coworker using foul language like G D this and F that. It was uncomfortable. As I was leaving, he saw a car pull up and said why do people keep coming? Oddly enough I thought that too."}
{"text":"This is the worst pastrami sub we have ever eaten at a subway, half of it was fat and even though it was toasted, it was cold on the inside. Bread was soggy from all the fat."}
{"text":"Convenient location. Drive through a definite plus. Service is best around lunch time when they are their busiest. Typical Subway menu made fresh."}
{"text":"I like this location because of its convenient location and drive through.  It is really good for breakfast and lunch.  Afterwards, service is a bit inconsistent.  Menu is pretty standard.  Some very healthy items, some basic subs.  Made up fresh.  Still hate meat that's warmed up in a microwave though."}
{"text":"I would rate higher if they would just more than a .00001 inch thick slice of meat across the sandwich.  Subway is all bread and a total waste.  So many better places out there like Firehouse or Boardhouse!"}
{"text":"How much money for a big ball of bread with a .001 inch thick layer of meat on it?  

NO THANK YOU."}
{"text":"Convenient location to my hotel.  I like the healthy choices that Subway serves and their frequent deals.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Location clean and well kept.  Good choice for healthy fast food."}
{"text":"I generally like Subway's menu and this location had some of the friendliest service I have ever experienced.  Got the order right, prepared well, and I did have a large order.  Good choice to stop in the area."}
{"text":"Nice location, typical somewhat healthy Subway fare.  Probably the nicest service in the area among the multiple Subway locations.  Generally pleasant employees who prepare your sandwiches nicely.  Parking can be challenging, but within walking distance of a lot."}
{"text":"Lines here are moving quick and the service is pretty fast. Actually, this particular Subway is just a little better than average for Subway. Not only the service is fater but somehow more friendly and polite.
Prices and quality of the food are similar, comapred to other locations. 
Love how they prepare Tuna in The Flat Bread! Seems, they have a really good sandwich artists around to please the clients. 
The restaurant is open 24/7 and provides lot of parking space. The only con I cam came with is that this place need a little bit better maintenance. It;s not very plesant for me as a customer to eat on a partly clened table or floor with napkins."}
{"text":"Very good. There's never a line. Your in and out of it. Good employees. All nice. Very clean location to check out. One of the cleanest subways I've been to"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I am writing a review for a Subway sandwich location. I never have problems until I came to this location. The staff were unwilling to offer me the $5 sub deal, and the sub gave me an upset stomach afterwards.

I never plan on returning. I feel sorry for the people who live in the condos nearby and eat here because of convenience."}
{"text":"Came in and the place was empty. I just simply went in to order a sandwich. Suddenly one of the employees came out and just had a disgusted look on her face (like she didn't want to be here or something) She did not greet me or anything. I politely told her my order and proceeded to do it as if I were an inconvenience. Once my sub was toasted she just gave me a blank stare waiting for me to give her my veggie choices (normally subway employees ask you want kind of veggies you want.) I told her what I wanted (again politely) and just her vibe felt very negative. Once I checked out, she just handed me the receipt without a \"have a nice day\" or anything. She was totally rude. This was the worst customer service that I have ever experienced. I could give this girl the benefit of the doubt, but she could've at least tried. She just made me feel very uncomfortable. In my opinion if you hate your job to the point where you don't treat customers right, then do us all a favor and simply quit. I doubt I'll be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Very nice staff. The manager was in when I was there and he personally said hello to every single person eating here."}
{"text":"Subway is always a great option when I'm trying to eat healthy and don't have time for dinner. I have gotten multiple subs and they are all good. The toasting option they added a few years back is life changing. I like the meatball sub, oven roasted chicken, and the simple turkey. Their honey nut bread is very tasty when I'm going for a healthy option. Otherwise the Italian herbs and cheese is my favorite. I love that the bread is very soft, not thick, and not tough like most places I have gone to. Everything is always very fresh from the bread to the vegetables and even the amazing cookies. 

Not going to lie service can be slow as they don't hire the brightest employees. You have to make sure you pay attention and say one thing at a time so they don't miss anything. There has been times when I came home and was bummed because they didn't put pickles or what not. Other than that everything is always great. 

I have also order the sandwich trays for parties and they are very fresh and delicious for a great price. Perfect addition to baby's showers, bridal showers, etc."}
{"text":"I came in at 8:30 PM tonight to pickup a veggie patty sammich.

A guy in a black polo was walking around talking to another guy in a booth. As I walked up, the guy in he polo must have noticed me and went across the room to start mopping.

I walked up to the counter and ordered.  I was asked if I wanted it toasted... yes. I'm still not sure why the veggie patty was microwaved for about 50 seconds prior to being toasted. I've never seen cheese hiss and pop out of the oven like that at Subway.

While I was at the counter I looked at the guy in the booth and he had a napkin sticking out of one of his nostrils.  The worker mopping was talking to him and napkin-nose was spouting ignorance about being sick, going to the hospital, AIDS, whatever.  While napkin-nose was talking the sandwich artist had the \"shut the f--- up dude, I've got a customer\" look. I've definitely been there before.

The late shift guys need to tell their pals to act normal or wait in the car. Also, they need to check their veggie patty reheating game."}
{"text":"4 stars because it still IS fast food and goodness knows that I am terrified of fast food and because it's barely food in the grand scheme of things... I can smell their bread as I type this. I heard a rumor at some point they made healthy adjustments but I don't know if it's true information or not. I know the bread did change but unsure if they really removed the high fructose corn syrup.

All Subways across the board are pretty standard, this isn't different they offer the same precut \"fresh\" veggies probably chalked full of flavorless preservatives and the same \"fresh\" baked no one made thr dough bread.... but as far as location, I felt I should perhaps write a review. 

I haven't experienced any issues in my visits. There may have been a time I went in and received 4 olives 2 cucumber slices and a tomato but I know I can ask for more if I need it... That was once though and we have been there a few times now. 

The staff has always been friendly upon any of our visits and they get a better review based on the service alone because let's face it, Subway is Subway here or on the other end of the valley..."}
{"text":"Typical Subway but newly remodeled and now has a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Subway is subway. This tastes like...subway. The customer service could use some work, but you are In and out in 5 minutes.  It's close to work and very convenient for that reason. The customer service though, does need a make over."}
{"text":"So, I decided to try the Flatizza, BIG MISTAKE. Had enough pizza sauce on it to make a large real pizza. The flatbread was so hard I couldn't eat it and the cheese was cheddar not mozzarella."}
{"text":"For all of you with the negative comments.. You must have never met Brianna. Such a cute girl and damn can she make a sandwich!! She is very personable and down to earth and you can tell she isn't forcing the conversation. I was hesitant about what I should order and she answered all my questions and remained patient with me. Truly an angel. The lobby is also kept very clean and food fresh. They share the store with a donut shop so there's also the delightful smell of donuts. I will never go to another Subway again. This Subway and Brianna are THE BEST!!!!!"}
{"text":"I walked into this Subway Sandwich restaurant at 9:30 pm. The employee (Bangladeshi Gentleman) looked very annoyed.
He said he is closing in a few minutes and I should return another day...lol...this never happened to me in my life before."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I went there a little after midnight to try their new Reuben. I ordered it traditional but then the guy says we are out of rye bread. So i got it with Italian herbs and cheese. He gets the cheese and meat on my sandwich and then i ask for it to be toasted. He then tells me their toaster is down for cleaning even though no one was cleaning it. Who wants a cold Reuben? He could have said the toaster was down as soon as i ordered a hot sandwich. So i got a cold Reuben on Italian herbs and cheese for $10. I'll never go back to this subway. If only capriottis was open 24 hours. At least i know I'm getting a good sandwich for $10."}
{"text":"Yes, that fuzz is MOLD. Hairy mold that grew on my tuna sandwich in 24 hours. I ate half of my 6\" and this was supposed to be day two's lunch. A little irritated, disgusted and hungry!"}
{"text":"Probably the best customer service I've ever had at a subway and I come to this location quite often for lunch. They are always very quick and great you on your way in which I appreciate it. They just got a new manager for this store and you can tell the difference already."}
{"text":"Boy are they busy. And yet consistent great customer service and efficiency. Waiting time is almost none.  
And what I like very much is that there is NO tip jar in site
Thank you"}
{"text":"This is just a typical Subway. 
$5 for any footlong all month is a good deal, probably the only reason I would come here. Got viscously sick one time after eating a meatball sub here, last time I do that. 
Staff can't really be bothered to smile, forget about saying hi, and that really bugs me. 
Way better subs close by at Sub Station, or even across the street at Teeter! 

I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Typical subway.  Open 24 hours and it has self serve soda which is nice since the waitresses in casino royale are non existent.  Nothing special at all but it was good enough to eat there twice on this trip."}
{"text":"I went to this location about a week ago around dinner time so they were kinda busy and had only 1 girl working there and bless her heart she was trying her hardest to whip those subs together and she always is so nice... But I have had a girl named Jennifer make my subs a couple times and not only is she rude as heck but she is so sloppy with making them... She always has a attitude even when I asked if could have a napkin because she ain't put it in the bag she just put them on the counter and started talk to her friend.... Not a sorry or thank you I mean nothing...."}
{"text":"So I use to like this location because they were so sweet and sanitary... I can honestly so its no longer that case... I'm a vegan and I ask for gloves to be changed so the meat that they handled from the previous she helped would touch my food ... she went to cut my sub with the same knife that she cut with the person before me that had meat on her sub ... I stopped her before she cut it and rolled her eyes ... I didn't take a picture of the actual counter but meat was inside the veggies and cheese ... just somewhere I can no longer go ..."}
{"text":"I give it 2 stars because it is a subway and I enjoy it, but at this location I watched the sandwich maker use a knife and press it down on 5 different people's sandwiches before getting to mine. Before I could say anything, I had a knife that had mustard, avocado, and who knows what else wiped on my basic turkey and cheese.. Something has to be done about this because that is disgusting and people could be allergic to some of the items."}
{"text":"I love Subway sandwiches! I always go with either the Steak and cheese or the oven roasted chicken breast sandwich. Subways are always consistent on quality but service can vary drastically per location. This location is brand new. Opened on 4/15/16 and service is on point. 

John was friendly and fast. Made for a easy takeout order. Though honestly this place is great for dine in as well. Love the interior and wooden floors. Just a pretty looking subway. I've been to other Subways in the area, there's about 3 of them in a 1/2 mile radius, and this one is already my favorite. The other one down the street has super slow service late at night."}
{"text":"On my way to work last night I decided to stop at this location, big mistake I was never waited on. It was 9:30pm the girl at the register kept saying I will be right with you as soon as I put this order in, I was the only customer in the store, and the other worker was out in the lobby in front of the television, she had me standing there for a while and then asked him could he start my order and he looked upset, I waited for him to start but he just kept walking around so I left. Now I see why everybody was in chipotle, this place needs better customer service"}
{"text":"The toaster oven was not working, the Italian bread was not available. The wheat bread was available  but was stale. I did not enjoy my steak and cheese sandwich. The customer service was minimal at best. 

I never expect great customer service at that location but the quality is usually good, not the case today. Neighter customer service was very good and the sandwich was not fresh."}
{"text":"Subway is pretty standard. This one is clean, quiet, and quick.  I'm usually greeted as soon as I enter the store, that's always a good sign. The employees are johnny on the spot with whipping up your crazy sandwhich combinations."}
{"text":"Basic Subway man!  It is what it is!"}
{"text":"Wow! I came here two days ago and ordered a footlong steak and cheese sub on flatbread, toasted. The sub came out nice and hot, with just enough crispness to it. The associates here are friendly and accurate.

Four stars instead of five due to overcooked/burnt cookies. Would definitely recommend this Subway due to the friendly workers.

Review #216."}
{"text":"This is a terrible location the staff are absolutely rude the food taste terrible. And the store is filthy"}
{"text":"Go Elsewhere!
Girl working by herself (Every Wednesday as she put it), has a constant line of people waiting, Every Wednesday morning. Obviously Management is as poor as the Service, only worried about the Bottom-Line!
A toasted sandwich, yet the egg comes out Ice Cold. Definitely a training problem. More worried about Up-Selling for the additional charges than about getting the order correct!

This location is obviously more focused on profit than product quality and Customer Service."}
{"text":"Most of us have all been to a Subway by now.  This one makes your sandwiches quickly and better than most.  Don't let the hustle and bustle of cars on Brookpark road scare you into thinking this is a below average Subway."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this location! The smallest meat balls I've ever seen, about the size of a 50 cent piece that they put 6...yes 6 of those tiny things on a full sub! The look I got when I asked for some marinara sauce.... Excuse me! I don't want a dry \"meatball marinara\" sandwhich. Then you'd think the kid behind the counter had to milk the cow and make the cheese! Barely a sprinkle of the shredded Mozzarella on the sandwich. Really? Then the tuna sandwich....4 tiny scoops for a foot long? Really?? WTF!  No, not impressed. Wasted my time and money! Worst experience ever for a Subway. Never seen this B.S. At any other location ever. I'm pissed."}
{"text":"It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't.

If you've been to one subway then you've been to them all. What stands out from this one and the others is that its 24 hours, has a drive thru, shares space with Winchell's, and is well kept. 

After midnight only one person works here so expect some delay.

Side note: anyone else feel weird ordering subway through the drive thru?"}
{"text":"Great place for subs while running between classes! Although, there's always a long line right around lunch-time, so get there early or plan on getting a late lunch."}
{"text":"Just like their jingle on TV \"$10. $10 footlongs\" Wait, no, that's not right. It's in the middle of a tourist trap mall. Not sure what else I expected."}
{"text":"Adriana is always a pleasure to see! This store is always clean and everyone is so friendly!  I enjoy coming here for lunch. I've been coming here for 5 years!  I've never had a bad experience!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First time in and was pleasantly surprised. Christopher was the only one working (I think ) and he was very kind. Greeted us immediately and always had a smile on. Very kind. Definitely left happy"}
{"text":"totally lousy chain store cold bread and cheapo ingredients, tomatoes taste bland from a freezer? lots of thugs hanging around here killing time before picking up their beauty queens at the beauty school across the street, super small space"}
{"text":"Their chicken wraps are the best, they have cherry coke, and the staff are very nice!!  The old guys from the senior highrise that come in there are very rude, and I'm impressed by how well the staff accommodates them!!"}
{"text":"Always fresh cookies! Love the team they always get me order right. Isabel gives he best service super friendly talks a lot and I love going in when she works."}
{"text":"So I have never been to this subway and when I was a student years ago this location was who know what . How times have changed , but a great location for ASU students that are literally across campus! Today I went with the classic 6\" BMT what sub! Ah talk about the cravings when you need a quick meal and go go go !"}
{"text":"Holiday Monday and was not looking to prepare dinner so the local subway is adjacent to the mega circle k to get polar pop refreshments. Subway is great with offering coupons to feed the whole family .  The footlong spicy Italian specials for $4.99 were perfect for the four of us ! The sandwich artist Lisa was awesome. She was very patient and gave us the best deal possible! She was so attentive that she individually labeled each six inch with what was exactly in the sub! Great unexpected service."}
{"text":"When it's 240am on a Thursday and nothing else is open, Subway is ALWAYS a saving grace. Really hit the spot! Great service!"}
{"text":"This location is closed. Thebuilding has been leveled to the ground. Update your database."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of subways and they always have sad employees, but this one was crazy. These chicks working there were so sad I thought they were gonna shed a tear right into my sandwich. I mean they barely talked and looked up. The manager must beat these poor souls in the back before letting them serve the public. I was getting depressed just watching my sandwich get made. No \"thank you\" or \"have a good day\". Just tears and a skimpy sandwich."}
{"text":"I really do like subway sandwiches especially when the service is really good.  I went to in order the $2 Customer Appreciation sandwiches actually ordered 5 my order was 4 meatball sandwiches on two of them cut the meatballs in half because they were for children and then the other three sandwiches were just regular.  The girl seemed to know what she was doing.  She is my order gave me the amount that I owe which is fine, until I said thank you and started to explain to her that this other subway on rainbow didn't have many balls do you know she closed the window in my face????!!!!  Totally RUDE!  Here's her hostess id 688-191-1394065, her name is Linda!  In case you read this I am sending the same review to corporate!"}
{"text":"What can you say about Subway?  It's pretty boring but very predictable.  You will get a decent sub for a good price.  There isn't really anything special about a Subway sub.  The restaurant is clean and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Awful experience. We came in at 9:30, so a half hour before closing and we could tell that they were closing up early, but it was still a half hour before close. The girl working the sandwiches, i believe her name was Mackenzie or Kenzie or something. She had a really bad attitude, she also obviously did not want to do her job. She put the bare minimum on each sandwich and did a sloppy job, piled the sauces in the middle of the sandwich, i wanted avocado on my sandwich but they had already packed it up. overall very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I was out with a customer and we only had about 40 minutes to eat lunch so he suggested Subway.  They were a little backed up as the rest of the lunch crew wasn't due in yet but it didn't take too long.  I had a 12\" chicken bacon melt and it tasted pretty good.They didn't mind us moving tables around fro a group of 5.  The place was clean.  As we got closer to noon the line really grew."}
{"text":"I've stopped here a few times now.  Not much on a regular basis.  Subway makes an OK sandwich.  The staff here has always been friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is my favorite subway...  the people who work there are nice people.. when someone who absolutely hates their job makes your food it affects the meal.. these people care and want to make  your food delicious.. and they succeed"}
{"text":"Clean and roomy dining area. Friendly staff. My three sons ordered their subs and all were pleased. No crushed red peppers. Doesn't look like they have all of the fixings a more urban Subway would have, then again, I wasn't ordering. Three happy and full boys!"}
{"text":"We were in this location last week and when we got to the register the credit card machine was down.  Two young teenagers were working the front when the manager Robert came out to check the machine.  After 15 minutes we were told if we did not have cash we couldn't receive our food.  The manager addressed nobody and left the two young boys to deal with the customers, they were obviously very uncomfortable.  No apology and they threw all the food away.  If I could give them a negative 5 for customer service I would.  Luckily for us there is another subway two blocks away and we will go to that one from now on."}
{"text":"Pretty good place made my sandwiches in a minute
Workers always had a smile on their face even with a rude person"}
{"text":"One of those places they put all 8 slices of meat in a pile on the center of the bun instead of evenly spread out.  Very little care for sandwich making."}
{"text":"Not kid friendly. No h/c. They are the only ones in the neighborhood that still have seafood and crab salad but I happened to get the bottom of the pale so it was kind of gross."}
{"text":"The reason I am reviewing Subway, Excellent customer service! It's not often that I would choose Subway over Jimmy Johns and now at the new building for work I have both at opposite sides of the street to choose from. But today I was craving veggies and a sandwich so I headed on down to Subway at 1 and was greeted right away and helped by excellent sandwich artist all the way down the line.   

Love a place that has outstanding customer service, no matter what type of service they are pushing!"}
{"text":"I went to this subway and it was like they don't want any customer at their counter. They were making face while making sub sandwich as if we are annoying them by telling them what we want in our sandwich. They just ruined the mood. If possible avoid this subway. In addition to this, sub is expensive too than the other subways I have been too!"}
{"text":"I have been in twice and both times employees were very nice. This location is very clean.... I live near three subways but would pick this one."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, Subway is Subway as far as product goes most of the time. As far as service goes most of the employees here are in decent spirits and helpful however the other day I went into this location with a coupon that randomly showed up in the mail and had a simple question about it. When I asked about the details of this coupon the girl immediately snapped back at me with, \"the coupon says what it says!\". I personally am in the service industry as well and there was no need for the rude snappy behavior of this girl. I'll gladly drive a mile down the road and go to a different Subway and take my 4-5 meals business a week to a different location."}
{"text":"Whoever did the hiring at this Subway deserves a pat on the back. The staff is always patient and helpful and the food is always prepared correctly. I'll gladly drive past the other 2 Subways between my house and this location to eat here."}
{"text":"This subway was awful. We are from out of town and came in at 1045am for lunch. There was only one gentleman in line already getting his sandwich made when we walked in. The worker making the sandwich appeared to be new as he asked the girl sitting on her phone in the back questions about making the sandwiches. He was pleasant but she didn't offer to help and didn't respond to several of his questions because she was too busy on her phone. So he would  have to ask a second time. Her name is Selina. After we got our food we sat down to eat and listened to Selina talk to the other worker about the closer from the night before in a very poor manor using swear words while they were in the front of the store. Our sandwiches were very dry and the bread was falling apart. As we left the two workers were at the register talking badly still about the other co worker and my husband purposely said Thanks Guys as we walked by them to leave and neither one looked up or said good bye. The worst food and service ever!!!!"}
{"text":"I live just three miles away from this Subway and end up there about once a week when I'm too lazy to cook dinner or just don't have time. It's always very clean and the people are always nice. A person who must be the owner or manager always makes the best subs, and he always smiles if you ask him how he's doing. At this point if we drive up and see him in there we say \"our main man's working\". Just about everyone else there makes a good sub too, but his are always the best."}
{"text":"Not sure who owns this location but i only can assume they are a total monster to work for.

The two girls at the counter suggested something with every transaction, something i definitely am not accustomed to at Subway.

Literally everything to the point they are almost arguing with you, and they did this with every customer that walked in.

Large size, extra cheese, extra bacon. Little much."}
{"text":"The crew at this store is not one bit customer friendly. They seemed more interested in throwing out the trash and banging pans together than assembling my foot long.  I was adrenaline happy and just off a good solid hour of the best cardio in weeks. My expectations are not even close to a dog a pony show but could you have at least acknowledged my obvi existence.  Aint coming back period"}
{"text":"This is the best Subway that I have ever been too. The crew that worked there were awesome. If you want subway then go to this location. We will be back that's for sure. Best service I recommend this place to everyone and my sandwich was delicious"}
{"text":"The food is what one would expect to receive when heading down to a subway. I am not fond of subway personally, but its close, clean, and the food is the same everytime. You cant beat a $5 dollar footlong either if your on a budget."}
{"text":"Hungry, lazy, and did not want to cook.  We have a subway in the neighborhood shopping plaza, so what the heck.  Sandwiches it is for dinner.  I have not been to a subways in over 8 months or so.  I got the chicken bacon ranch.  Not too bad.  More chicken would have been nice."}
{"text":"I always stop in this subway to buy a dozen cookies for my customers.  They love them!!"}
{"text":"So I am working at an office in Cross Plains, WI  where is that you may ask well its a small town  near Madison, WI that has no cell phone service unless you have Verizon or Sprint. 

In Cross Plains they have literally 4 yes 4 places to eat for lunch.  That being said I have been to Subway 3 times.  Each time I order a Roast Beef on Wheat and each time I greeted by 3 friendly ladies who seems as though they are truly there to provide excellent customer service.

When you go to a chain to eat you don't expect people to \"wow\" you.  I mean you know what you want..you know what they have..you just know.

These ladies are friendly, patient, and nice.

Great service!"}
{"text":"YAY for 24 hour subs!! Okay maybe I'm getting way too excited about some shriveled up subs but I actually found my orders to be much better than the walk in stores. So far this location has been accurate with my order (knock on wood) and very tasty. I see this being very popular with the stoners late at night."}
{"text":"This location is open 24 hours and no one cares if you sit for several hours working on your laptop. It's quiet at night with a slow trickle of customers, and it's next to Gold Bar Espresso!"}
{"text":"Normally I don't review Subway's but this time I felt I must. We came here late with a craving for subs. Everything was going okay, me waiting in car until fiance comes out and says please tell me you brought your purse and I said no, we ran out of the house and I brought nothing! Well apparently he forgot his wallet and went back in to tell them that we would have to return. They said it was okay and gave it to us anyway. Now I don't suggest that anyone try anything to get anything for free but it was a very nice gesture. When we came back to the store to pay, they said that's okay! Awesome people work here!"}
{"text":"Everything so far has been up to standard. They offer delivery service which I am too wary to try. Waay too much opportunity to get things wrong there. Pretty friendly service every time and this location is open 24/7!!!"}
{"text":"We usually place orders for 4 or more sandwiches right at lunch time, Not only are they slammed at the order counter making sandwiches, but they are making our sandwiches also without missing a beat and all the while smiling and friendly to everyone there, Hats Off to the ladies at this location, we will forever be your best customer. Dan Bradley Glass Shop"}
{"text":"We come to this subway quite often. They're always very friendly when we first walked in the door and throughout our whole ordering process. They have always given us everything that we wanted an asked for even if it's extra they inform us that it's extra and we couldn't be happier with this place. My daughter always gets the same thing and now they remember her when she walks in which makes her feel special which makes me happy."}
{"text":"This location is not the best, but also not the worst. The staff is kind of slow, and they always seem to have a new person. Unfortunately, I always happen to come in when that person is training, lol. However, the restaurant is always clean, so at least they're on top of that. Since it's near a middle school you can expect there to be kids, so if you're easily annoyed by kids I wouldn't recommend this location. The kids aren't on your face or anything, they are mostly just waiting for their rides while enjoying a sandwich... lastly, I mentioned the staff was kind of slow, but they are very nice."}
{"text":"I like this Subway.  It's newly remodeled and if you go after 12:30 you beat the lunch rush.,  It's always been clean when I go in and the workers seem to stay, not a super high turnover.  They are always super nice too."}
{"text":"The placement is primo! Right next to Mandalay Bay. The service is alright and the food is typical Subway."}
{"text":"Most ridiculous Subway I've been to...first of all, they run a drive thru which isn't proper for a sandwich shop. The drive thru worker, one of the two which they have on during lunch when they are more than likely busy (poor managing) assists the line outside rather than a customer inside. Very poor customer service. Then, an Italian BMT which they had on special for 3 dollars comes with salami pepperoni and ham. I do not eat ham and have had turkey substituted in many times and many different Subway shops. This individual says they can't do that. Can't throw two pieces of turkey on a sub in place of ham because they pay more for the turkey. I can understand that...but how much more do you pay? $30? $40? $100?? It has to be minuscule and to make a customer not happy to save .30 cents is absurd. I'll never come to this dump again."}
{"text":"So I've been here 3 times. All 3 times they only have 1 employee running around with no clue how to make sandwiches , meaning pressing the bread down and cutting it wrong , Hardly putting lettuce on down to burning the bread, besides all of this I've noticed I've never been able to order anything here. I wait in line they ask me to sit down it may be a while if they speak English . I wait 15-20 mins and still usually never get to the front of a 4 person line. They have to take the order make the food take the gloves if receive payment then wash hands and tend to next customer. Whoever runs this place is atrocious and puts their 1 employee through hell. Don't recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night at around 7pm, the place was empty.
There was only one lady working, she was in the back prepping until we talked in. We took quite long to decide what we wanted, she kept walking back into the prep area to do her prep and would peek out every so often to check if we were ready to order.

We ordered 2 foot long subs, the lady served us quick and as soon as we got our order, she walked back into the prep area to continue her prep.

The sandwiches were average as other subway locations, up to par, nothing really to complain except that a bit more sauce could be added to the sandwiches especially when we're not getting a million different ones but just one or two.

I noticed that the price of subway have gone up over the years and I came to purchase one because I have a coupon that came in the mail. I might not come back to purchase another one because the worth of food and food quality isn't worth the price they are charging."}
{"text":"Horrible service at subway on sahara / durango , I ordered a meatball sub and there was 8 meatballs and i asked for one more meatball because there was a fat chunk of just bread she gave me trouble so i pressed the issue and got what i wanted but i also got attitude the other girl wrapped my sandwich bad and when i got home it was falling apart worst subway ive been to"}
{"text":"Just your average subway minus the girl behind the counter was not the sharpest, she was nice though"}
{"text":"Only 2 people working during the 5pm hour. Line kept growing as I was waiting. Both employees were slooow. After watching one employee open the fridge door wearing his gloves, go into a different room still wearing gloves, and then start making a sandwich for a customer without changing his gloves, I had to leave. During my time waiting the health code violations just kept adding up. As a Chef I just couldn't stand it."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a coupon for buy one foot long with the purchase of a fountain drink, and get one foot long sub free. We were greeted by the employees who were friendly and immediately started putting together our sandwiches. I ordered the seafood sub, provolone cheese with multiple veggies, mayonnaise on wheat and my husband ordered steak, veggies and provolone cheese on wheat. We had our bread toasted as well which added to the flavor of the sandwich.
The sandwiches were delicious and everything that went into the making of our sandwiches was fresh. We haven't ate at Subway for at least 6 months and we were pleasantly surprised. Both my husband and I agree they have improved overall and the bread tastes a lot better since they changed it.
We go to this particular location because it is close to our house. The restaurant was clean as were the restrooms. The employees friendly and caring. 
We will return."}
{"text":"First time I went there, 2 teenage girls were working, both didn't want to help & were trying to make the other help me. Finally one of them came over, made the sandwich and I noticed there was a gnat on the inside of the sandwich glass by the ingredients but didn't say anything. The girl who didn't help was eating the whole time glaring at me.  Wanted to give it another try... second time there teenage dude was cool, made the sandwich... and at the end when I was paying I noticed a bit more gnats along the glass... looked closer and saw them on the banana peppers, cucumbers & spinach. Done."}
{"text":"I give this place, reluctantly two stars. There were 3 girls working. 4 people in various stages of the line. The girl on Veggies gave me attitude, when I asked for the tomato slice, withot a giant hole. she put 4 slices of cucumbers, I asked for the subway amount, so she added one more slice, when I told her another one needs to be added, she huffed. she never properly closed the sandwich, she used the paper to close it, so when I went to open it, all my ingredients fell out. by the way this girl was working, I don't blame her, I blame the franchisee, for not making sure the staff is properly trained. I will not be going back to that store again!"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of having lunch at this subway today.  I told the woman making the sub to not toast it.  She starts putting it in the toaster/microwave so I said to her, \"no, dont toast it\".  As she's taking it out she slips or something and my sandwich goes all over the floor.  She leaves a minute then comes back.  Never says sorry or anything.  Instead she asks me for my order like it was brand new.  She didn't remember the type of bread I had or anything.  Even though I told her I only wanted 1 sub, she again asks me how many subs do I want?  Then for vegatables I told her I wanted green pepper, but she started to get the yellow/banana peppers.  So I had to point to all the vegatables I wanted.  I told her it was for here, but she wrapped it up to go so the other woman working had to put it in a basket.  I never got any apology or even a discount for having my food on the floor, then having to redo everything from scratch."}
{"text":"Clean location with adequate seating.  2 stars for lack of parking and hassles I've had with staff (owner and son) on two occasions.

Free parking is available in front, but very difficult to obtain (2 spaces, if I remember correctly), especially at lunchtime.

Agree with previous reviewer that they don't like to honour specials here.  For an emailed breakfast promo, they required a printout of the email, even though it was on the website, Twitter and radio (and printout not specified on email)."}
{"text":"Subway is usually a pretty good place.  Cheap, quick, and fairly tasty, and sort of on the healthy side too when compared to other fast food options.

This location however, has relatively poor service.  No matter what time of day it is I swear this store always has only one employee working, which is a huge problem during busier parts of the day.  One time I had to wait 25 before I was served, and there was only 3 people ahead of me.

I usually rely on subway for a quick meal when nothing else is practical but this location always lets me down."}
{"text":"I had the meatball sandwich and 2 of the 6 meatballs were literally hard and half burnt (yea burnt)...Don't know if I just came on an bad day or what but ive been to better subways."}
{"text":"Subway is Subway....convenient  for me being at the El Cortez - live 2 blocks away! Good goto lunch spot for a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"The hospitality at this location  is nonexistent.  The 2 young ladies working tonight could use some training in the customer service area. Not once did we get a welcome, thank you, come again,  or fair service. Why ask if I want a 6 or 12 and I ask for 6 and you make a 12 anyways.  Why ask if I want it toasted, and the answer is \"no, thank you \" and you toast it anyways. At 9:59, as we were checking out, another customer entered. The open light was still on. He got a greeting. \"We're closed \" , he did get an apology though.  My friend said maybe you should turn off the open sign, so she jumps the counter, turns off the sign and aggressively yanks the cord out. If you're open til 10, stay open til 10."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this subway they do something weird with my sandwich. They never know how to close the sandwich after putting all the veggies in the. One lady was jabbing her hand in the sandwich to try and make everything fit, another lady took the paper and tried pushing my veggies in and got all my mayo and mustard all over the paper. They are always skimping at this location with the veggies. I have to continuously ask for more and more veggies. Stop being cheap!"}
{"text":"The sub was good an staff were nice. However the roaches were visible an she said they had it sprayed. Guess it needs more pest control. 
This place needs regular checkups."}
{"text":"Want the worst Subway in the valley? Come here, Jace is the absolutely worse and is extremely rude when it comes to greeting people. I mean come on, if you aren't busy why do you have to act self-entitled and be rude to customers."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food but no public restrooms. In a city that already has a problem with feces being all over the place they can't even provide a place for a paying customer to wash their hands. Shame on them! Okay I had to update my review because when I walk out of the subway I literally saw s*** stains on the sidewalk on the side facing Flamingo Road. Here you go!"}
{"text":"Zack is revolutionizing the way I look at Subway. Give this guy a cookie bravo! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"My family likes Subway, my 10yr old always order chicken breast on Italian bread with ranch.
Today at 5.49pm when I ordered two sandwiches,I was told there is 'no ' ranch dressing! The person in charge should have handle the problem better instead of cleaning up the the equipment.
I will not patronize this location anymore ( too bad because it is near to my house). The 'new' employee making my sandwich was nice."}
{"text":"Fuck this place. Nothing worse than sitting trying to enjoy your food, than sitting there and having bible thumping music pounding in your ears. 
Turn it to a regular radio station, stop forcing people to listen your your music where it sounds like everyone's trying to have sex with Jesus.
1 star"}
{"text":"Manager at this location (Walner/Alma School) has very good attitude of taking competitors coupon.Very warm service.
The location across street of MCC is also very good.

The worst location I've encountered is the Mill/Southren location,
The \"tight face\" old man is very mean for someone working at front.

Another very bad service location,Subway Elliot/Priest. 
The Asian cashier there do not give change back, she would stared at you & not answer your question, very unpleasant customer service."}
{"text":"I love Subway & have never had a bad experience in any of their restaurants, EXCEPT for this location. The food was fine as usual, but the staff is awful. Rudy & Ashley are extremely rude & unprofessional. My friend & I were waiting to get helped for 6 or 7 minutes. Right at the end of our wait my friend was showing me something on her phone and when we looked up, Rudy was standing there making a face to Ashley, annoyed that we were on the phone. AFTER WE HAD WAITED SEVERAL MINUTES TO BE HELPED. Not once did he address us asking for our attention, but proceeded to be rude & unprofessional to us as customers instead. Then when Ashley was asking what condiments my friend would like & my friend told her \"that'll be all\" Ashley said \"really?\" & proceeded to make a rude face & role her eyes. Both Rudy & Ashley need serious customer service relations training ASAP. 

The cashier Kate however, was so pleasant, kind & wonderful. She was the only thing that saved our experience. Thank you Kate for treating us the way customers should be treated, with respect."}
{"text":"The service was so great - from the second I entered the door being greeted by a warm hello, until the time I left (ate in) when I got a hearty thanks and come back soon.....thought I was a Chic-fil-A for a second!  Sandwich, drinks, chips, cookies are all the same from one Subway to the next; however, the service is what makes the difference and it was OUTSTANDING!!!  Jesse was awesome - even though it was at the end of his shift, he was very engaging with the customers, softly upselling (I got a dozen cookies after my meal to give to the ladies at the cleaners next door as they are super friendly as well).  I'll be back simply because of the superior customer care offered by Jesse!"}
{"text":"This subway location is great!  I came in close to closing to order 3 subs for myself and parents rather close to the time of closing.  Despite it being so late, the man who served me was incredibly kind and patient, making sure that I was happy with how my sub was topped and sauced. I knew which sub was which, but he offered to mark them for me anyway which was nice. They're not stingy with the toppings either. Great experience!"}
{"text":"This one facing Walmart is the worst Subway location as far as customer service.
The one inside Walmart is much better than this."}
{"text":"employees are less than friendly.
has management ever heard of greeting customers ?? ohhh wait that would mean you need to take your face out of your cell phone and stop texting. New employee completely not ready to be left alone especially not at lunch time. Third employee grunts when you speak to him. If you all hate your jobs that much GET OUT Otherwise remember you work in a service industry put a damn smile on your face and fake it till you make it!!!"}
{"text":"i have never been so thoroughly disappointed in a sandwich as the one im eating right now. a woman making it far enough to be the democratic presidential front runner wasn't as disappointing as this sub. and that's very disappointing seeing how low this country's standards have dropped. subway endorsing a child pornography owner wasn't even as disappointing as this sub. i'd be better off eating grass clippings on the stale bread from my basement."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people complain about the slow service here.  I understand that and have experienced that myself on 4/22/18. It was late in the evening. There was one person working inside and a bunch of people walked in just as we pulled up.  To top it off, the drive-thru speaker wasn't working well.  We were tired, cranky, and just wanted our food.  

How on earth could this experience rate four stars?

The turnaround came in the form of great customer service from a young man named Martel.  He kept calm and handled business like a pro.  I had ordered meatballs and he wasn't sure how to package them.  He not only did an expert job packaging them, he had considerately made sure my requested cheese was propely melted as well.  He took painstaking care to ensure that my husband's sandwich was made correctly.  It really turned that trip around."}
{"text":"Drive thru is 24 hours but workers are always hiding in the back or something cause no one is ever present at window or order box to take orders. Smh"}
{"text":"This was a standard subway until recently, when the quality of the bread seemed to skyrocket. Now I've gone 3 times in a row and the bread has been really good every time. Very good for a subway"}
{"text":"Ordered and paid online, when we got to the store we were informed that they don't carry the ingredients for one of the sandwiches we had already paid for and could not offer a refund. Paid $40 for 3 footlongs.. totally unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Unkept store with apathetic employees. 

This location is within the Arizona Center, so there are crowds based on ASU and conventions in the area.  Unfortunately, they do not keep up with the crowds. 

The bins of veggies, meat, etc. for the sandwiches looked almost empty, and a lot of it had not been kept up. 

The restaurant itself had not been swept in a while; the tables had lots of food / spills on them. 

The employees were apathetic, and I had to keep repeating myself for what I wanted. 

Why did I eat there then? The Corner Bakery supposedly stays open till 8pm but was closed at 6p."}
{"text":"So I got the sub of the month which was the tuna on wheat  on provolone and it was so delicious was 5-stars!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The slowest, unprofessional subway workers in the house. I swear it takes them a full 5 mins to serve one customer. If you're third in line, forget it, go somewhere else before you starve to death. And there's only one person working, so idk what's going on with this location."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 meals in the drive through. My son wanted his usual (turkey and bacon only). The bacon was raw. The bread was stale. I had to go in and ask for the bacon to be cooked. The employees gave me an attitude. They rolled their eyes, they were slow and it was apparent they didn't care to be there. I got food poisoning. I thought the food was \"off\" but I had no idea. 

If I could give this place zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Subway is always a predictable in airports, because how well the food travels.  Given that all airlines have cut anything resembling food service (and every connection seems to be like 35 minutes, no stopping for you), I grab Subway before my first flight of the day and it usually doesn't disappoint.  My fellow travelers are jealous when I whip out my sandwich as they're enjoying peanuts and a very small cup of Coke.

This Subway location was right on, there in Terminal A next to my Southwest Airline gate, it hit the spot.

The server was attentive (no line), took care of us quickly.  She almost warmed up my sandwich after I said not to but I stopped her.  She served with a smile and the sandwiches were great.

Store was clean, just what was needed!

Quality of ingredients were very good and when I was hungry on number two flight of the day, this was just what I needed."}
{"text":"They messed up my sandwich and I didn't realize until I had left the store that it was still cold in the center. I called and they said that I needed to toast it. I told them that I asked for it to be toasted and that it was still cold. I then asked if I could just have a refund and they refused because I had left the store.

I went back a few weeks later and the same guy was working who I think is just not all there. Definitely a huge jerk and pretty dumb. They messed up my sandwich again in the same way (which I think might be down to the way they are preparing the chicken compared to other subways) so I just had him microwave it this time. 

Oh I also asked for a medium drink and he just gave me a large and said that it was a medium. Like, dude, I'm not retarded. I know what size of drink I want and I don't want that giant cup you moron"}
{"text":"Ohhhh Subway.....


The only thing i love dearly is your chipotle southwest sauce...
YUM YUM YUM!!

I can never stop getting no matter how hard I try to say no!!

Oven roasted chicken breast with the chipotle sauce is out of this world!

or in a egg sammich....

it makes the whole sandwich honestly if it werent for the sauce i would not go there because i can make multiple sandwiches for $5.

the service at this location was on point"}
{"text":"Racist, disrespectful, refused to server subway

Today at 12:30 AM I went to subway with my wife to have sandwich. Kevin was helping us with our order. We were buying 2 foot long one for us and one for our friends. After the subway was grilled I said we want letus, tomato and cucumber. My wife said put all the veggies and I said no as my friends did not want spinach and couple of others veggies. 

Kevin who was making the sandwich in a very rude tone said can you guys decide what you want on your sandwich as I am getting confused. On which I said buddy just relax as it was just a discussion between me and my wife and I was giving him the order. He mentioned I think you guys don't understand meaning of confused. To which I lost my cool and said its not the way to talk. What did he mean by us (me and my wife) not understanding the word confused was he trying to put a point as we are Indians we would not understand English. 

Then he further lost his cool on which I asked for manager's number to which he replies he is the manager. I almost know everyone in the store so I said then give me your manages number to which he replied it written on the door somewhere. When I was not able to find managers number on store I asked again to give me number to which he gave the number of Chris and said \"take this dude and get out of the store\" and he refused to server us a sandwich as he had thrown away the previous 2 sandwich which he was making . 

When I said that's not the way to talk to customers he replied I can talk as I refuse to sell you sandwich and we ( I and my wife) are trespassing in his property. 

I am not sure if I would ever return to this or any other subway after this incident. As I always use to go to subway to be happy and have a good time. But this incidence has left extremely bad impression. Specially this being holiday season you want to spread happiness and customers should not be ill treated. I will make sure I spread the word and warn all of my colleagues and friends that this branch subway be very careful as Kevin might just decline you or refuse to make a sandwich and snap at you leaving you in a very in comfortable situation. I don't know why am I wasting my time in middle of the night to write this long email as I am not sure if any action would be taken. Luckily I had Taco Bell to my rescue and making sure I don't sleep without food. 

Sandwich server: Kevin
Location: soccer Mall, 4927 E bell road #69, AZ, 85032

Manager name provided: Chris

We also called Chris standing in cold from out of the store and would be going again tomorrow in his (Chris) duty hours to log the complaint. 

PS: we understand it was middle of the night and Kevin was sleepy but if this is the attitude and behavior which customers would receive then it better to shut off subway after 9 or 10 pm."}

{"text":"My favorite subway location! Staff is polite and very fast. The eating and bathroom areas are very clean."}
{"text":"Sandwich wasnt that fresh. The most disgusting bathroom I've seen in Arizona!! Looked like a mechanic shop bathroom!"}
{"text":"Dirty place! They don't even wear gloves when making the food. Also one employee had a bad attitude when he forgot to toast my bread after asking me if I wanted it toasted. He was upset with me because he forgot which I didn't understand. When making the second sandwich he was throwing the food together resulting in a terrible sandwich. I will never go to this Subway again!"}
{"text":"This really is hands down the best Subway I've ever been to. The guys here are fun and cheerful. We are always greeted and they make our sub just right! 
I honestly hadn't been to Subway in years, and my husband was talking about an old favorite sandwich, which got me thinking of my old favorite... the warm chicken breast with American cheese, bacon on Asiago bread and all the veggie fixings! 
We had a coupon and on a lazy Friday night we seized the day! We go out of our way to go to this location because service is fantastic and everything was delicious. I hope they don't change a thing here!"}
{"text":"Their service was very quick, especially for it being lunch time! The first employee that started my sandwich wasn't the happiest or most polite individual.  She seemed very much in a hurry even though there was nobody else in like behind me. The gentlemen that I was having lunch with didn't know what he wanted yet, so he asked for a second to look and her response was \"well do you at least know what bread you would like, maybe that would help you be more decisive\". That was pretty rude for my taste. Then lady that finished my sandwich was very polite, joked with me, and even complimented my tattoos! Overall, it was an average experience that you would expect from subway, but could definitely be better. If the initial employee would have had a better attitude or seem interested in assisting us, it would have been a better experience. Often times people that work in customer service and hospitality forget the customer service part. It's rather unfortunate."}
{"text":"Worst Subway ever! Came here for breakfast and had an egg & cheese omelet in a 6\" flatbread = $6. the price aside, it took 15 minutes to make, the egg was undercooked, I didn't get a chance to ask for any veggies in it or even salt & pepper! My wife got the same and boldly asked for veggies which the sandwich assembler reluctantly threw in (literally 1 slice tomato and 2 shreds of lettuce) and charged her extra for them!
This franchise should be held to better standards!"}

The woman who I've dealt with there was also awesome and had my platter finished asap even though they were really busy that day.  Thank you for being so kind!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this shop for years now, and it's definitely one of the better subways in the valley. 
A couple years ago I would not have said that, the service was a little poor and the staff was not friendly.
However, more recently, this is my go to subway. I always see the same guy, Will, and he makes some perfect sandwiches. He's really friendly and professional, fast, and looks like he cares about his job. The store is always clean which is another plus. Like I said, great subway to go to if your in the area."}
{"text":"Slow service. I don't think the person making my sandwich could've moved any slower. And, when they spoke to me, they were really quiet and talking to the floor rather than looking at me. 

Also, how many subways don't have raspberry iced tea? This one doesn't which was a huge disappointment since I normally look forward to that when I go."}
{"text":"Ok, the wait at 10:30 is a little crazy. BUT I have to say Nick handles himself well. He was calm, patient, and nice the whole time to everyone. He was working alone, not sure why if you're that busy at that hour but he did great. He makes a sandwich that surpasses other subways. Thanks Nick for a great experience."}
{"text":"Karry and Ingrid are wonderful sandwich artists! They always make delicious sandwiches and they are always so sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"Just went tonight and walked in and the guy that was there was too busy making his own sandwich rather than at least saying \"hello\" and \"i'll be with you shortly\". Instead we stood there looking like fools for 5 minutes until the girl named Maggie came out to take our orders. Maggie was great but i'll be going to another establishment if this is the customer service I get."}
{"text":"Normally I am OK with Subway in general. I have been to this location a number of times. Subway falls into the average category however today was horrible and I don't blame the staff. I blame the manager/owner/franchise.

Showed up today around 1230. Line was out the door. It appeared as if there were only two people working. One was some kind of shift leader plus somebody who must have started today as he was not allowed to do much on his own and quite frankly did not know anything.

I left as did others. Was somebody sick? The lunch shift could not get covered? Or did management cut back on staff to save a few dollars?

You should read by other Subway review for the location I went to after I left here."}
{"text":"I had left another Subway location(see the other review) to come here and should have stayed where I was. I arrived as the gal behind the counter was building two sandwiches for an OCD college kid.

There was a couple in front of me that had been waiting 20 minutes before I got there. There was a guy who was in charge but he was working the drive thru window.

A woman showed up to pick up a catering order that was wrong that took the staff gal off the line for a good 10 minutes.

The couple in front of me ordered 5 sandwiches. Two were veggie and the guy ordering had a cow when the sandwich dude touch the bread of the veggie sandwiches with the gloves he was wearing to touch the meat of the prior subs.

I am 30 minutes in the building, it is my turn and then the guy tells me to hold as he just got a drive thru order and had to make it before he could help me. So let me get this straight, I am waiting 30 minutes to place my order when I should have just hopped in my truck and went through the drive thru to bypass everyone waiting in line.

The other gal got done with restocking and the catering order so she built my subs and I was finally out of there.

Again, poor management and staffing."}
{"text":"Subway's also good with me. Make this short & sweet.

Star 1: The location is cool, next to a Golden Spoon & Rosati's.
Star 2: Everything's organized.
Star 3: The food looks pretty appetizing.. Unlike other Subways I know of.
Star 4: The server was pretty nice.

What's up with the 5th star? Dirty tables. Get your Adele on & turn some of them 'til they're clean."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy Subway, but there are off days. Why are the off days at this location?

Cleanliness: It's clean, moving on.

Service:

The servers are hard to understand. Period. They need to do something because the communication isn't great.

Food:

The ingredients don't look fresh, and I don't know why. But it looks that way, and consequently it TASTED that way.

Step it up, guys."}
{"text":"Thanks subway for turning me away. I'm glad i was able to come to pizza pizza where they were ok with me using there washroom. BTW their panzo was delicious"}

I am glad they finally switched the kids meal bags.  We have way too many of them.

They added more seating outside."}
{"text":"Called for party platters to feed 150 people. (No other subway in the area would help.) This subway pulldes it off for me. Split it between two locations. Called at 8am and had it ready to go by 10:30am. The gentleman was beyond nice and i coudlnt thank him and the staff enough!!!"}
{"text":"Never again.   I like to go to Subway in a pinch. (like I'm really hungry and the only other place around is McDonalds) but there's one thing I've noticed repeatedly that grosses me out.

The employees act as if the gloves are to protect their hands. 

Money has to be the filthiest thing on earth and handling money with gloves on and then going back to prepare food....

Eeeeuuuuwww!

It's not just at this location.  This was just my last attempt."}
{"text":"I've come to this Subway location at least 3 times within the last week and have never been able to enter . The walkway is filthy , trash is all over the place , people hang out and blast music right in front of the entrance . I've tried different times of the day , weekdays , doesn't matter . I actually drive an extra 10 minutes to avoid this location altogether ."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly. Apologetic for the LONG wait ... On a Saturday. Took 24 minutes to order and pay. Lots of customers with multi sandwich orders."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  Ghetto.  Rude.

Those are the nicest things I can say about this hell hole.  Like everyone else I only come here because of the drive thru (which usually takes about 20 full minutes to get through AND THAT'S WITH NO LINE).  The employees there are clearly depressed and could care less (which isn't really their fault. They make 8 dollars an hour.) Just awful.  Avoid it at all cost.  It's gross clearly never cleaned and they don't care about their customers at all. Go 2 miles up the road there's another one, it's also 24 hours. Clean and friendly.  Trust me."}
{"text":"I work next door to this place so I get to watch people walk in and out of it all day, it seems like they get pretty good business. I went there about a week ago and now I see why they get all of that business. There was a line of about 5 people that stayed the same BUT only because of the rate people were walking in, I was amazed at how fast they were moving the line and keeping up with the people continuously walking in. I'm a Manager training to get my own store where I work so I know what's needed to run good stores in a customers points of view and they definitely have it here, hopefully I can get my crew on the same track, great job subway. I can't really say I've ever had a quality issue with food at any subway so they're all perfect with that, but this stores customer service is well above average."}
{"text":"Either I am in a foul mood or Subway is starting to lose its mojo.  They did not even know I was there to order, the roast beef tasted like cardboard, the tomatoes were full of fibrous inedible cores, and the onions were large chunks.  Lastly, the sandwich was only cut 2/3 of the way, so when I went to pick up one side to eat, it totally pulled the other side spilling the contents.  The staff appeared like they were in a casting call from Dazed and Confused."}
{"text":"Great Subway experience great service very fresh veggies no complaints. Some of the reviews scared me but I tried them because we were staying at the Bluegreen Resort right beside it I give them a thumbs up."}
{"text":"For some unholy reason I find myself returning to this Subway branch even though there are half a dozen Subway locations just a stone's throw from my downtown office.  Yes I'm a glutton for punishment, I think I keep returning to this Subway cause it just feels so shady.  Ghetto, maybe is a better word, why I think this? I've no idea.

Back on topic and more to the point, I've never had a problem here, the staff have always been friendly, attentive and quick. A bit young and rather indifferent, but can you blame them.  Don't expect good service, it's consistently OK. The food, well it's a Subway and lives up to the Subway standard.  In a bizarre twist, they freely pile on the olives, pickles and even tomatoes, but lettuce is another story.  Every single time I order a sandwich, I have to ask for extra lettuce, sometimes more than once.

It's a Subway.  It's downtown but feels like it is in the ghetto. Best described as average. I'm not sure why you visit, but if you happen to be in the area, the food is up to Subway's standard and the staff are young and competent but unenthusiastic."}
{"text":"I've been to the Subway on Gilbert Road several times now for breakfast.  The service is good and the people behind the counter are very attentive but their toasting oven is a little tired.  If you order the breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon and cheese on flatbread you need to ask them to toast it twice because if you don't, you'll probably get egg that is cold in the middle .. yuke! .. the good news is that if you make that request they don't hesitate and they do it for you .. they really need a new toaster over in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came to a \"24hr\" subway today at 5am, I and we were told \"I'm on break for 20 more minutes you can come back after that!\" Way to go subway staff!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of this Subway location, and I decided to give this location another shot after being fed up with a few other locations in the area and have come to find out that this Subway location is now under new management!

I already see improvements too! No more 5 cents a bag sign when you walk in the door, I mean come on who in their right mind would try and charge you for a damn \"sub bag\" for you sub! Luckily the new people running this location have done away with that!

Its a very clean location, and has quite a few seating and wifi too! what more could you ask for from a sub shop!"}
{"text":"So this dude can't even make a tuna sandwich!made the tuna outside the sandwich on the table when he was trying wrap it,then he picked it up and put it back into my sandwich.never gonna come back."}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars. I am so disappointed with my sandwich. It was falling apart from the beginning. Soggy on one end and stale on the other. Happy Memorial Day for me. Thanks subway."}
{"text":"I have been to this Subway a few times before, but after what I saw I will never return to subway ever again. I was in there a few days ago during lunch and behide their food line I saw a rat running around, i told the person working and they just seemed to blow it over their shoulder, I lefted empty handed with no need to eat my subs where the rats hang out at."}
{"text":"I went to this Subway at 7:15 am to get a sandwich.  The lady just looked at me and said we're not ready yet (they open at 7 am) and sent me away.  The employees are very rude and the service is bad on a good day."}
{"text":"Fast and efficient workers. Good lunch. Looking forward to eating here more on my lunch breaks. Food was fresh. Thank u subway."}
{"text":"I'm not always thrilled with this location, the service is usually slow and subpar but today I had a great experience. There were several people in front of me and everyone moved fairly quickly. Eduardo was very nice and got my order exactly like I wanted it. I was greeted with smiles and served promptly, I was in and out wishing a matter of minutes even though there was some traffic. One of the better experiences I've had at this location"}
{"text":"Subway is subpar! End of story. The flavor and selection is okay. The veggies are mostly fresh but the bread-I like my bread soft and this is where they fail-epically! The middle and usually the bottom of the bread is okay (inconsistent) but the top and edges get hard and crusted over. I hate this and will not eat it. I was totally  exasperated after they failed to refund me or offer to make me a new sandwich when I brought the hard crusty turkey sandwich back- a non eaten sandwich.  And I had the receipt. That is poor business practice and customer service.  I'd try a different sandwich shop if I were you or at least a different location. Just say NO to subway!"}
{"text":"This particular subway is a little strange.  It seems the owners are usually there helping customers which is good,  but the more veggies you add to your sandwich the more aggravated they get! \"How much stuff are you going to put on a $5 sandwich?\" Is the comment I got. Nothing else, obviously,  and you can keep the sandwich thank you."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service with a smile, what else do you expect from Subway? The food, yes I've tasted better, but I wanted a quick no-hassle lunch close to my office and that's exactly what I got."}
{"text":"Worst service, rudest people. Some of the most discussing slopped together sandwiches ever"}
{"text":"I found myself wondering if the little guy that made my sandwich today had a money bet with someone in the back to see just how skimpy he could be with the product that he served. The meat was loose and not in the little white trays or separated by paper as it usually is. So he hand picked and visually estimated a portion... How odd.

I miss the guy that looked like Vanilla Ice with the cool soul patch that made my sandwiches in 2012. He would always stop Collaborate and listen.

The place is still a quality location with good food other than the one \"Turd sandwich\" I received from little \"Mr I'm not the Vanilla Ice guy\". I would still recommend this location as top notch."}
{"text":"This is your a-typical Subway restaurant but with exemplary service. 

Good sandwiches and salads, fairly simple and the original \"select what you want down the line\" fast food concept. My coworkers and I have come to really like the weekdays aligned with certain sandwich specials like Turkey Wednesday. I though am a huge fan of the sweet onion chicken teriyaki salads with allllll the spinach, none of the gross iceberg \"lettuce\" they offer.

The people really make this location special. The shift manager appears to be present all the time when we swing by and always makes good (not-fake) conversation. Her kind demeanor is appreciated and reverbs off of her to her fellow employees which keeps bringing us back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the year. Each visit has been great. No issues with the orders and the staff was great. The facility may be small, but it has been clean each visit. There are also concrete tables outside that anyone can use to eat outside."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I been such bad customer service girls that work there are so rude they don't even greet you or smile definitely will never go there again it doesn't even deserve the one star"}
{"text":"Your experience at Subway is relative to its location and employees. While all Subway menus are the same, the quality and handling of food can change substantially from location to location. 

This Subway has a group of employees that wish you would implode in the parking lot before you make it to their door. I'm not expecting someone to hold the door for me, welcome me to the establishment, and take my coat, but do you people really have to be such a bunch of frowny muthas? 

I can't crack a joke, utter a friendly word, or either breathe in the same space as these employees without getting the look of death from any one of them, especially the older guy with grayish hair. He's either a card carrying member of the shortbus, or he's too busy fantasizing about stabbing me repeatedly in a dark alleyway to actually speak to and make eye contact. Maybe he's prone to seizures, I don't know. 

If you go here, and you're even slightly undecided about what kind of bread you want, or what kind of toppings should go on your sandwich you should probably call the PoPo and ask for an escort back to your car. 

I'm not one to hamper anyones freedom of choice, but enter at your risk, and bring an umbrella because they will piss on your parade."}
{"text":"Poor service and don't serve what other subways do. Asked for a 3 inch sandwich for a little boy and it came with lot of conditions. Meat has to be turkey only etc."}
{"text":"I've came twice now at 8/830am the doors are always locked, the employee ignores you knocking at the door. Till another customer has to open it for you and then on top of that the employee is rude! 
Won't come here again! If you're going to be 24 hours be open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"WOW! Well I got attitude from Jackie (if that's her real name) tonight and after her making my sandwich- I opted to drive two miles to a better one. First- I nicely said I would wait until she finished making a man's chicken sandwich- since I'm pescatarian and didn't want meat touching my sandwich. I said it very kindly and I got attitude. Then- I refilled a drink I bought three hours before and she charged me for it. I nicely told her that I bought it a few hours before (literally the ice just melted) and she said WELL I DIDNT SEE YOU.  I said, are you calling me a liar?' She smirked. I asked for a manager #. She gave me a fake #. In addition the night staff never makes iced tea even when we ask for it. I'll be going to the Charleston branch from now on. The man that helped me there was amazing. I'll get his name next time I go in. Very helpful, friendly; actually acted like he wanted to be there.  Won't be going back to this one. I actually bought lunch and dinner at the Hualapai one today and have gone there as long as they have been open and have been a great customer. Today they lost a great customer."}
{"text":"So this complaint was from like a month ago when i visited this place, and the franchise owner is a liar and doesn't want business, i guess and i say, ive been here like 50+ times before. If I could, I'd give this location a negative number review. But the thing right now is i don't want to, EVER, go to that store while Alex, manager,  is working.... i mean, ive had problems with a bunch of different places ive been before but i never sat down to write a complaint about a place ... i guess this just pushed me to the edge. Alex was a HUGE jackace! (i cleaned it up a bit) and the owner is also working his way to that name."}
{"text":"VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. 
I got to Walmart at 8:30 went straight to the subway pass by right in front of the worker, she was to busy talking to 4 Walmart employees chit chatting away ignoring me. A minute or two later she turn around looked at me and said she was close. That on Sunday's they close early. At this point it was 8:34pm but according to the hours posted on Yelp and website they suppose to close at 9pm. I said thank you and walked away looking at my watch and thinking why?!? One of the guys standing with her told her you going to get in trouble without hesitating she said she didn't care.
As I was checking out at the self check out I saw a couple or two more customers turned down by this girl. Still talking to some guys.... 1/2 hour later. I'm beyond upset at this situation. All my 7 year old want it was a simple bread with turkey. It was a reward for doing excellent at school that previous Friday. A sandwich that would have taken her minimum 2 min..... I've been trying all day to get ahold of a manager. If there's a number or a responsible person that works for this place I can contact."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time going to this Subway location, first time no one ever came out from the back so I ended up walking out.  I now realize that was a blessing in disguise.  I decided to go again today because I was right in the area.  First, they only had one employee working.  Lettuce was very wilted and turning brown, then the phone was ringing and she put the caller on hold and with the same gloves went back to making the sandwich!!  Disgusting!  Luckily it was only a side of jalapenos and I was able to just throw them out.  Lastly, as I was leaving I heard her pick up the phone and start arguing with someone who I am assuming was a friend or family?!  Very ghetto location and I will not be returning!  Very sad because normally Subway is pretty clean and a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Today I visited this Subway for what may be my last time in a long time because I'm moving to California. I did not get the name of the sandwich artist who constructed my sandwich, but she was basically the Leonardo Da Vinci of sandwiches. She actually ripped up the spinach, green peppers, and onions and evenly dispersed them across the beautifully toasted Spicy Italian sub. I highly recommend this Subway to anyone looking for a delicious and cheap sandwich."}
{"text":"Sucks.  Small portions.  Rude workers who don't speak English."}
{"text":"Horrible service....only come here when I have to. The subway down the street on Warm Springs and Cimmaron is A LOT better!"}
{"text":"This was the WORST experience in a subway I have EVER encountered, considering I was a team leader for three years at a Subway. Front the jump, the girl with brown matted hair and sweat pants that took my order at 2:15 on this rainy Saturday, was completely oblivious she did not come to work how she should have. Bad first impression, this was my first time at the store. I ordered a sweet onion chicken teriyaki 6 dollar meal deal. She smashed my bread to the consistency of a thin loaf bread. Proceeded to cut the connect piece of bread so again two pieces of thin load bread, I asked her to put some veggies on the sandwich before toasting, she seemed to not like that at all.  But instead of putting the cheese on the meat she put it on the bread with the veggies.... NO! Then to finale, I asked for some extra sweet onion sauce, not sweet onion with a side of a sandwich. Anyways I opened the sandwich at the table, it fell completely out, everything in the sandwich. I then got up to ask for a fork and the other girl came up and said I can make the sandwich again for you, but I was so disgusted with my experience and my sandwich I said I wanted my money back, and I was given that. I walked out and threw everything but my drink In the trash. I will NEVER come back over here, and I will definitely let my friend know not to grab catering from this store either!!!!"}
{"text":"Am I a bad person? A gross person? I really do love Subway.. time for honesty, I eat here at least 3 times a week.  It's only a block from my work and maybe that contributes to my Subway habit, or maybe it's the fact that the lunch crew knows my name. I hope this confession does not make me yucky."}
{"text":"False advertising,  I was just here minutes ago and they were closed.  Open 24 hours should be open 24 hours simple as that."}
{"text":"Just came to eat at Subway the customer service where the best sandwich was very very good very healthy good place to eat again great customer service!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a Subway, it's small and usually empty. Great for a quick sandwich on the go when you just don't have time for anything else. 

I tried to make a breakfast burrito here once, don't do it.

Yes, I just reviewed a chain."}
{"text":"Yes it is on campus a huge plus. It is Subway and if you need food (and convenience) this is the shop to stop at. Service is fine, it's a sandwich not rocket science, it's not that bad. Store is clean, kinda small, but come on it is a kiosk shop. Grilled chicken on flatbread.. yumm..yumm..yumm"}
{"text":"Loving their new sammich & it's a trip to be able to call ahead & have your sammich ready when you get there. Kudos to you! Excellent & friendly service"}
{"text":"The owner is cheap as F***, if the employees mess up your order, they would have to call the owner of the shop and ask if they can remake your sandwich or not. I got a tuna sandwich and the bread was old (very hard) not toasted, I went back to the counter and told them I wanted fresh bread for my sandwich, the girl called the owner and he told her to just replace the bread instead of making a new sandwich, can you imagine what a mess was that? I got very frustrated and told the girl to just give me my money back, she had to call the owner again, and when he got told I wanted a refund, he then told her to make my sandwich right from scratch. I'm not coming back to this location again, this is the first time I have an experience like this at a subway store, just tacky!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars to this \"Subway\" I would.  I live less than 3 minutes from here, but I've only eaten here maybe 3 times since it opened.  Each time was a disappointment.  I've had to actually take sandwiches home and put more condiments on.  They are so stingy with the ingredients that the sandwiches end up being complete garbage.  Waste of money.  Drive to Chardon and get a sub from their Subway that is a million times better and the people speak english and are pleasant to deal with.  I'll never go here again.  3rd time, was NOT the charm."}
{"text":"This place is the worst Subway I've ever been too. We've been there many times because we love Subway and its so close but last night was the last straw... no bread except for wheat and wraps, ordered a 12\" at driveup window and was given a 6\", asked for toasted got burnt bun, asked for bacon and got none,  tried to use coupon we received in the mail but was told owner doesn't accept coupons. Many times before our order has been messed up, we've been told items weren't available and more times than I can count the store has closed, like a half hour, before their posted closing time. When it gets late, like 8:30, they lock the doors and you must use the drive-thru. The drive-thru has a digital ordering system that is limited and we have never gotten our correct order by using the thing. Not sure if employees aren't able to read the order or the system is messed up.
Oh, and they barely put anything on the sandwiches... Just really disappointed.. Next time we'll drive to Mayfield or Kirtland."}
{"text":"the food is fresh. the current crew won't greet you with attitude. fast service. if there is no response at the speaker in the drive-thru, pull up to the window. want a ton of onions (or your other favorite veggies) on your sandwich? just ask, and you shall receive."}
{"text":"Michael Carrizosa works at our local Subway and they are the best!  We recently had a huge resident activity that Subway participated in by making a generous donation.  We appreciate their business and recommend anyone to use Subway.   Thank you Employee Name, we appreciate everything that you do for us at Ascent at Papago Park!"}
{"text":"I love this location! Its close to lots of stuff and easy to stop in for a quick bite to eat. The sandwich makers are always so friendly and polite. At some other places you feel like you are bothering them by asking them to do their job. Not here! Great Subway."}
{"text":"Alright I'm  giving Jonathan five stars.  (Hope I spelled his name right,  probably not) sorry.  He made my sandwich exactly how I requested. I told him I was a chef and asked him to change his gloves,  he did.  I asked him to change the lettuce cause it was old and discolored,  he did.  He was super perfessional , polite, and friendly.  I don't usually even eat out especially subway but sometimes you just have a craving.  The worst part was they don't allow you to tip on your debit card.  I had no cash and wanted to tip him, but it wouldn't let me even sign.  It sucks when I can't tip someone who truly deserves it.   It was great service,  the sandwich was made perfect (I even rang the bell) and it tasted great.  Hopefully  jonathan will get something out of this cause he deserves it.

{"text":"Joseph was awesome !! Gave great customer service and was very efficient. I  always go in there late and feel so bad for the person working cause there's no music and they're all by themselves so it doesn't take much for whoever it is to get busy . Let them play some music !! But he was great . Welcomed me and made sure I had everything the way I like it"}
{"text":"Avoid this location! If I could give this 0 stars I would. First off, the employee seemed very unmotivated to take my order and even more, making it. I had to repeat myself several times on which toppings I wanted, and on top of that left the chicken on my salad uncut until mentioned that I desired it to be cut into pieces. Look at the picture of my salad, would you pay $9 for it?"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of subways and have had good service but this guy Damon has been the best!! Went to this subway after midnight expecting to have some grumpy employee who hated his job working, but to my surprise he actually cared about his job and pleasing his customers. He wasn't complaining about having to work graveyard, he was just happy to be serving his customers. As he made every sandwich exactly how I asked, we talked about his family and how he's about to have his first child. Oh and we even talked about Pokemon Go.  He didn't get distracted from the task on hand which was to make my sandwiches.  He made sure all the toppings were spread out evenly on the bread and the sandwiches tasted great! Thank you Damon for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Honestly this is the best Subway west of the Missiissippi. Great service and even better subs. I tend to eat subway 3 times a week because it's just so healthy and delicious."}
{"text":"My sandwich was pretty good but could have been better. But when it came to my bottle of apple juice, I found an unexpected item. When I called to let them know, all I got was \"I'll check the rest\". There was no \"Thank you\", nor \"Sorry to hear that\", no \"Bring it back\", nothing. Be careful."}
{"text":"Didn't realize that the sign that says open 24 hours means that they are closed at 530am and the employee stares at you from the inside, comes over to the door, and tells you they are closed until 7...."}
{"text":"How do you mess up Subway?

I used to have swim meets at the nearby olympium a lot and Subway is, in theory, a great post-swim meal. This location always managed to disappoint me - it took a total of 14 minutes to make one sandwich once, and I was the only customer in there. I don't even understand how they managed that."}
{"text":"This Subway is dirty. The restaurant is dirty, the bathrooms are dirty, the employees do not change out their gloves as often as they should, the food does not \"taste fresh\"and the cookies are always burnt. If they are out of a cookie flavor they will not take it upon themselves to provide good customer service and bake them FRESH...without burning them. I mean seriously, how do you burn cookies?? This place needs management to step in and shape this place up. BAD"}
{"text":"It's been dead in here every time I've been, which is fine by me. That means no wait! The deals are great and the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"They will literally give you the bare minimum... they don't have napkins... it's not that they ran out.. they just don't provide napkins. I asked if I needed a key to the bathroom and the woman said no, there must be someone inside who locked it. Nope. You do in fact need a key and there is in fact no locking mechanism from the inside. She lied to multiple customers about the use of their public bathrooms until someone just basically demanded a key. Awful. Other reviews are right - they skimp on the ingredients & the fountain drinks are watered down. Otherwise, the sandwiches are fine... but what restaurant doesn't provide napkins though??"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been served OLD STALE bread at this location. At lunch time no less!! Subway is supposed to have fresh baked bread. This is unacceptable. I don't have time to go back and demand fresh food. Not only that, they charged me for an Italian BMT, when I ordered and received a Spicy Italian. Not happy."}
{"text":"Good Subway. They are always quick and polite and clean."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe that my favorite Subway wasn't on Yelp! This location has been open for over 2 years now. Oh well it is on here now let the check ins begin. It used to be better because it was connected to Josie's frozen yogurt but they closed up shop. anyways cool thing about this subway is they have some regular seating but also have 1 table that has two leather chairs. very comfortable and a nice change from the norm of most subway's."}
{"text":"Employee making our sandwiches was very unprofessional, her first words being \"what you want?\" She tried charging us $4 more to take something OFF of a sandwich, so we ended up not getting what we really wanted. My husband became sick shortly after eating his sandwich and was sick all night long which we suspect is a bad case of food poisoning. NEVER eating at this location again."}
{"text":"They make good sandwiches but their customer service needs improvement. I went there last month at night time around 8ish. And the guy who was making my sandwich was nice but what really bothered me was the high school girl who was working there also. She just stood in the doorway of the kitchen and was on her damn cell phone while she was on the clock. I know she was talking to her boyfriend cuz she would say I love you over and over and she would look at me as she would say it to try to make me feel jealous or something. I will find out her name and complain to the manager about it. She should be fired cuz that is just fucked up. That is why I cant stand preppy and slutty high school girls."}
{"text":"I went here on my lunch break because I had a gift card... I really wanted to give a better review because the person working did an amazing job.. HOWEVER, for some reason the manager or the other person who was supposed to be working left to run errands or go to the bank or something during lunch hour, leaving just one person working.  I spent 30 minutes in line and there were about 10 people behind me in line when I left.  Again, the girl working did a fantastic job and was working as fast as she could, but it may be better to plan to have at least two people working during lunch hour.  I really didn't plan to spend my entire lunch in line at Subway. I probably will not return to this location even though it is across the street."}
{"text":"Nothing like closing the door right as you walk up! Garbage. Don't say you close at 9:30 and you shut your doors on me at 9. It's not like you are a server and I'm going to be there past hours. I just want my sandwich and I'll be on my way."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get your quick Subway fix. It's location is great for all of the housing communities that are sprawled throughout the hills of Anthem Highlands and Madeira Canyon.

I've only had one problem (out of over a hundred times) with my order. They remade my sandwich and all was well with the world. :)

Some of the staff are very friendly - and then some are not or they just don't know how to communicate with people. Even so, I haven't had a completely bad experience and instead, I prefer this Subway over others in the area."}
{"text":"Food of course tastes the same or very similar to every other Subway.  I did want to get on here and say the service was decent and fairly quick, considering the dinner line that was there when I showed up."}
{"text":"Thus place is very clean! Good seating, and very friendly and efficient staff! Have to say thus subway should be an example on how they should be ran! Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"As in subways go, this has been the worst. Usually never have what I want. Always waiting on service. So if there is another subway.. Go to it! Might actually get a tuna that won't make you sick!"}
{"text":"Set the scene: We were the only guests in the restaurant, it was Christmas Eve about 10:30 am. Employees were slow and acted irritated that we came in. 
My daughter has the same thing every-time we go which does not entail a lot in the way of toppings. Turkey, shredded cheese, tomatoes and mustard. The Subway rep was extremely skimpy on these toppings despite my telling him twice that is all she will get on the sandwich. He begrudgingly put a little more cheese on her sandwich. The location we typically goes to will give her more as they know that is all she will have on the sandwich. The employees (there were 2 plus the manager sitting in the dining area doing the books) were extremely slow in making the 3 sandwiches.  The one employee making our sandwiches was irritated when I asked for olives. The olive container was empty and he put 3 olives from the container on my footlong sandwich and asked if I wanted more.... Yeah! DUH! I want more. It took them 20 mins to make 3 sandwiches. I also wanted a Dunkin Donut and coffee and he said he would have to make that a separate transaction, so another 10 mins passed before I got that. RIDICULOUS!  Terrible service."}
{"text":"This is one of nicest, well-run subways I've been too. It was spotless has a great feel inside. Carmen made my meatball sub today. Probably the freshest meatballs I've ever gotten. Then I noticed here instantly restocking what had been used. This restaurant is fortunate to have hired a polite, hard-working like Carmen. 
 

Thank you for the pleasant lunch!"}
{"text":"I'm not generally a fan of chains, but sometimes I eat here.

They follow instructions well. I can get something relatively healthy to eat, with little fuss, and it tastes pretty good. The personnel are polite. The food is fresh. It's clean. It's close to my house. The foot long chicken breast is $5, and they don't act like I have horns on my head when I ask them to remove some of the bread from the middle of the roll. The subway sandwich toasting machine is fast and nifty. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Drive thru service is slower than crap. They Assisi can't get an order right to save their life! Never again will I use a drive thru at subway"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS SUBWAY!!!!!!!!

I walked into the Subway at about 12:30 and waited in line.  When it was my turn, I ordered  a footlong BLT on herb cheese bread and a footlong meatball and pepperoni on Italian (their monthly special).  \"We ain't got no meatball\" the man behind the counter said in a mumble.  He had to repeat it a second time for me to understand him.  I then ordered a cold cut combo and requested that both be toasted.  

The Mumbler put my bread in the toaster and then went on to the next customer.  As he was preparing the sandwich of the customer behind me, he reached over the sandwich that his co-worker was preparing for the customer in front of me and literally put his armpit in her sandwich in spite of his co-worker's futile attempt to protect the sandwich.  

So the customer behind me paid and left and the customer in front of me had left and my bread had now been sitting in the toaster waiting, as was I, for the two people making sandwiches to finish with people BEHIND me.  Now it was finally my turn.  I had to explain the order again as The Mumbler had moved on to someone else.  Did I want my bacon heated?  As it looked almost raw, yes I did.  Then I had to wait again.  Why didn't The Mumbler put it in the toaster while the bread was toasting?  Two more customers behind me paid and left the restaurant.  The microwave dinged, but by now the woman behind the counter was helping The Mumbler as he seemed to be falling behind.  The bacon sat ignored in the microwave for at least two minutes.

Finally, we have the bread and the hot bacon. Three times while I was requesting the vegetables/ condiments, the woman behind the counter stopped helping me to help a co-worker, refill the napkin dispenser, and take another customers money (a customer in line behind me).  Two more customers behind me paid and left.  Then two more workers, one of which appeared to be the manager, came out of a back room and just watched the long line of customers!  Neither of them tried to help and then they both disappeared out of sight again into the back of the restaurant.

35 minutes after I walked into the Subway, I walked out with two footlong sandwiches and returned to work.  I gave my co-worker her sandwich and went to my desk.  That is when I realized that the bread and cheese had gotten mixed up on the orders.  Then my co-worker said that she had the wrong sandwich.  The woman behind the counter had given me one of the sandwiches that must have belonged to one of the myriad of customers that got waited on before me even though they were behind me in line.  The sandwich that my co-worker received was turkey and bacon.  My thought from earlier was confirmed as she said that the bacon was, indeed, almost raw.

My co-worker returned to the Subway in order to receive the correct sandwich.  When she explained what happened, the woman behind the counter explained that the man who had accidentally received her sandwich had returned that one as well.  THEN THE WOMAN BEHIND THE COUNTER TRIED TO GIVE THE \"USED\" SANDWICH TO MY CO-WORKER!  It took the manager coming out to convince her to make a new sandwich!

DO NOT GO TO THIS SUBWAY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star I would TERRIBLE service, TERRIBLE food, during lunch hours they move VERY slow the women have bad attitudes the one male that was in there didn't know much about the job originally ordered a pizza but didn't get it because they were trying to charge $1.50 per toppings and .50 cents per veggie which clearly goes against what the sign behind them said  the young Spanish women with long curly black hair got frustrated and rude I just said make me a sandwich instead was not about to argue with an employee smh I wanted apples instead of chips the guy at the register acted as if he didn't even know they served apples ended up get a whole meal of mess with chips the strawberry soda was the only thing worth while will never waste my break or money at this Subway due to the fact all of the customers that come to that location are corporate workers that location really needs new faces that are more trained for corporate customers and lunch rushes just my opinion"}
{"text":"Today was my third and final trip to this subway. There have only been two constants at this restaurant, the low quality employees & missing food. The first time, the 'store manager' proceeded to tell me everything she was out of (at 4pm) which left very little to choose from. The next time, we went on a Monday for the daily sub & they were out of meatballs by 6pm. Today, there was a customer ahead in line returning two to-go subs due to each missing the meat. (SERIOUSLY!?) By the time I got to pick my sub I had already overheard they were out of pickles & chocolate chip cookies. Both employees reeked of marijuana with the smarts to match! 

As the only fast food in Vistancia I expected much more!! We'll never go here again!"}
{"text":"STEER CLEAR OF THIS LOCATION!!!

The slowest phucking Subway restaurant I've ever been to EVER. It took approximately 17 minutes for them to make a regular foot long BLT sandwich with 4 people working with 3 people in front of me. The workers seem like they have no clue what they're doing (charged the person in front of me 6 drinks when he only bought 3) & it seemed like this was their first job they've ever had--- being that they looked like they barely passed the legal age of 15 1/2 to work. They need to get their act together with this place. Other than that, I'm FORSURE never going back to this location"}
{"text":"Like most franchise fast food, who makes your food makes all the difference. This location is usually okay."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for another sub shop near by, where I've never been before. I was curious about their prices and that turned me off as soon as I looked. I was on a Subway kick when I lived in another state a year ago and haven't tried Subway here. Walked in to this very clean, very friendly, and great location and ordered. Made one stop on the way home and was finally able to open up my sandwich, still warm from the toasting. As I ate it, I was pleasantly surprised. Probably one of the best Subway sandwiches I've ever had. The bread was soft, the veggies fresh, the meat and cheese perfect. It hit the spot for me. Thank you to the two nice people working tonight. You did try to upsale, but not in that annoying way, which is probably part of your job, so good job there too. Next time I'm in the mood for Subway, I know where I'm headed."}
{"text":"This place actually turned down the use of a subway coupon. I will never go back. If anybody is interested in coming up here, don't waste your time because I do not think that this is a good place to eat if they are not accepting coupons or trying to give you any kind of deal on a sandwich at any time, especially around the holidays. Their place is definitely a no for me. A big no."}

Came in late night after working a long shift and wanted a good sub made with care, and got nothing less than excellent customer service and care for my food!

{"text":"Came in for lunch today. Food was the same old subway. But I wanted to compliment the employee, Samantha. She was working by herself getting each customer through quickly. It's a shame she had to work alone, but she did a great job anyway."}
{"text":"Well first of all the girl who was making my sandwich had straight up lied to me when she said they cant do a footlong sandwich for the fresh deal. Second she said to toast the bread and it still came out soggy. Third of all she almost forgot to give me my drinks after i payed for them. And when i asked for light mayo and mustard she put a whole lot. She was also eaves dropping on my conversation with my friend and had to put her two cents in it. This stores customer service needs to be improved and be better."}
{"text":"I always come to this location. I always come at night and the lady at night is always so rude!!!! For what reason idk? She always has the biggest attitude and just wants to say things every time we walk in. I remember one evening when I came in and I was having a side conversation with my boyfriend and she wants to be like \"Miss I'm talking to you\" like...... what? Every other time I go in I get a pleasant experience and my food always turns out way better.... today when I went in my boyfriend happened to be on the phone and she made my sandwich and everything and she got upset at the fact that I told her my boyfriend wanted a sandwich as well... clearly she should of asked if I wanted anymore sandwiches.. all in all just why. Don't have a job if all ur gonna do is hate it and have an attitude."}
{"text":"I don't like this Subway because of the rude employees! They act like they hate their customers - no one smiles or welcomes you. It is so different from other locations.
I will drive further to go to the other subway rather than ever go to this one again. I have been there several times, but I am sick of it. No one should be treated so badly."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and this location is amazing. The staff is super friendly and they are always willing to add extra toppings and accommodate in any way they can. The toppings are fresh and their work stations always look clean. The space is clean and organized as well. The breads are fresh which I like because some other locations have stale bread. They put as many sauces as you want. 

However just on a side note, the franchise itself is kinda ridiculous for charging more than $7 for a veggie foot long cause it's only veggies while the subs with meat will be charged for meat only so the veggie ones are over priced."}
{"text":"It was your standard Subway, but they skimp on the vegetables.  My sandwich barely had any lettuce.  Service was a little slow, but they were courteous. We had sandwiches and I tried the chop salad.  I was not a fan of the chop salad bc everything was cut so small it was hard to taste things separately.  Matter of preference I guess.  The place was clean and had tons of parking."}
{"text":"This place is a 24 hours Dine-In Subway !
Great place to do homework at night very spacious and quiet and it's also a peaceful area. 
The staff is always very friendly and informative 
it's next to haggars (previously Vons) which is also open late night to get groceries after your meal!"}
{"text":"The online order system is a joke. They got most everything wrong on my sub, even though it's right there in front of them. I paid for extra cheese, yet only got 4 half slices on a footlong. Got radishes, didn't order them. No extra mayo or oil as ordered. Stale bread. Joshua tells me he watched the person make my sub personally (yeah, right), and he put on 8 half slices of cheese. OK, it's right in front of me and there are only 4. I think I can count. Never this Subway again, even though I live in Madeira canyon. Oh, and he says he can't give me a refund. Hello, I didn't ask for one. I just wanted the sub I ordered and paid for. No can do. Only 20% off my next order. There won't be one! Dan Foster, pay attention!"}

This location needs better training that's for sure. It literally cost me $13 for crap ass food!!! I hope they read this review and hire new subway people, stop settling for less customer service is key make your customers want to come back and not want to write bad reviews."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and this place just sort of sucks.

Here's a typical lunch rush such as today. 8 people standing in line. The first muppet in line has ordered 6 sandwiches and there's one employee working the sandwich line. Absurd.

(BTW, if you're that guy that goes to Subway during lunch and orders sandwiches for your entire office, you're kind of a dick. Not that that excuses Subway for being understaffed, though.)

This is Phoenix, there's a Subway on every street corner, so avoid this one. Zero customer service."}
{"text":"I am picky about breakfast!  Let's face it a lot of the options out there either aren't super healthy or aren't real affordable for average folk.  Subway is my favorite option!!  This subway in particular has great customer service!!  Lynda the manager ALWAYS has a smile on her face!  If you load up a gift card with 25 your sandwich is free so that's what I do for even better value!  The quality of everything is always good...nice fresh veggies and the breads are nice and soft!  All receipts have directions to do a survey...do it!!  Your reward is a free cookie!!  This location is 24 hours so go in anytime...everyone on staff is great . Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Worst subway ever! They were out of flatbread so I had to settle for another. The employees were rude, acted like they were doing me a favor by making a sandwich for me. English was a challenge for the guy making my sandwich as well."}
{"text":"No amount of smiles, pleases or thank yous can put any sort of nice expression or atmosphere here. So disappointing. There was a chick working with hair that was not put back, hanging off her shoulder and was chewing gum while working. And as a chef, I know the laws. The cashier, a man, couldn't even ring me out without her stepping in to tell him what to do. Sad I live so close, but worth the drive to another to get far better service. Oh, and when I opened my sandwich,  it was rolled into a little ball. Not the hearty sandwich I had built. With a carmel colored seltzer water because thr dr pepper is apparently out. It's not even a busy store, at least not any time I've stopped in. Don't even bother here."}
{"text":"Have to say that I am pleasantly surprised at how good the Subways in this area are to grab lunch in!  Stopped in here to grab a quick lunch and strayed from my usual Subway so that I could run into Ross in the same plaza.  

I ordered the 6\" meatball sub on wheat and it tasted exactly the way I wanted it to and the bread was definitely made fresh.  I also did the meal combo deal with cookies instead of the chips and they were baked fresh and tasted yum as well!

Overall: A
If I head in their direction to do any quick errands on lunch I'll definitely snatch up a meal here cause I know it's tasty!"}

I called the store got the IDIOT that was working he sounded like he was stressing out.

All in all this place has consistently good food, great staff, and they understand the lunch rush sense of urgency to get back to work with hot food!  A+"}
{"text":"This place just opened in June 2015 and its my second time there.  The first time I dined in with my fam and this time I used the drive thru.  The drive Thru is actually a touch screen that you order from and it's super easy to use.  I really like the location and the convenient drive thru.  I also wanted to mention the staff there is very friendly and the food is great."}

Called immediately and they took my information and was told manager would call me. Never received a call and didn't enjoy my meal.  Will go to another location next time."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a 6 inch club to bring to work. No wait- no complaints. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here four times since I used to work in the area. The first three times were uneventful and dram free, as any lunch hour should be. 

The Fourth and final time time, however, I ordered a meatball sub. I took one bite (or tried to) of it and the whole this fell apart. It was a mushy mess. I got up to exchange it for a sub I could actually eat. The \"sandwich girl\" (I should have gotten her name) saw me standing there but waited on two customers before acknowledging me. I showed her my \"mushy mess\" and she actually asked me what I want to do about it. Oh........those were fighting words, but I kept my cool. I told her I wanted a new sandwich, but NOT a meatball. All she said to me, without even looking up from the cash register was, \"I'll have to charge you .80 more.\" Oh good grief...whatever. I handed her my credit card. The purchase probably cost Subway more in fees than it was worth. 

Note to manager: Train your employees in customer service!"}
{"text":"I felt very ripped off.. I could see why some people have written concerning reviews about this place. 

I know this is a very busy area but when I walked in, I never got a greeting. Usually that doesn't bother me in a fast food setting because my expectations aren't that high in places like this. I know she was the only worker there to provide service, so I'm sure she had some confusion mixed up with my order and the pricing. 

I ordered the Spicy Italian and was charged for the Italian BMT instead.. I tried to explain to her that there was a mistake and I should've only paid $6.25 for my sandwich instead of $7.49 + tax.  I tried to explain my situation but she insisted on telling me to order the wrong sandwich as a meal which saves me a couple cents.. I ended up spending $8.11 on the meal

There was a language barrier and no one else there to help me explain my situation. No manager was around or other staff to support the busy traffic coming in. I felt hopeless but really hungry, so I just gave in to the argument and purchased the meal I didn't want and was charged wrongfully for a different item more expensive than my actual order. 

On top of trying to get her name, I did not see a badge on her uniform and was denied consent for it."}
{"text":"Yelp has this location as 'Closed'....it's not.  I was there today and had a 12\" BMT Sandwich on Italian Herbs & Cheese Bread ($6.00).  The Sandwich was made fresh and tasted very good.  I'm a big fan of Subway and enjoy coming to this location.

Will I return?  You bet I will."}
{"text":"I just popped in to get a raspberry cheesecake cookie. And the entire transaction the lady engaged me in conversations. She was very pleasant. The tables looked clean and the other employee was wiping the back area down.

I love Subway and should have had dinner here instead of next door."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was exhausted, starving and craving tuna and bell peppers. Flipping mentally through my head I decided that getting out of my car and going in anywhere was too much effort and decided soup at home will just have to suffice.

But than I remember passing this Subway that had a drive thru! I always thought it weird because you can't point at what you want. LOL Although today it fit the bill perfectly. 

I pulled up and it was an old school speaker, when greeted it pretty much squawked at me but was still understandable. It took me a couple mintues to spit out the veggies I wanted on my tuna, for some reason I kept wanting to say green broccoli! The lady was very nice and kept reasuring me she knew what I meant. I had a coupon for buy one 6\", get second free so I got a spicy italian for my lunch today. She explained that the coupon required a drink. I hestitated and said sprite, because I really didn't want the soda, but she said I can substitute the bottle instead. Sweet! I can give that away easier.

When completing the transaction, the same lady greeted me warmly, asking how I was -exhausted- sympthizing with me and telling me as I left to get some rest. Very pleasant customer service.

The tuna was super good, but that could've been my hunger making the opinion. I would have perferred more tuna and less bread though. Spinach, green peppers and red onions tasted fresh and delicious!"}

The BMT was awesome.  I had it toasted and put Provolone, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Green Peppers, Pepperoncini, Mustard, Mayo, Salt & Pepper, Oregano, Oil & Vinegar on the Sandwich.  Very tasty.....just how I like it.

{"text":"The tuna is always fresh veggies always fresh service is awsome and im picky so i have to have top notch and this place is it. Freshhhhhhh food loce it here"}
{"text":"My brothers and I went into to subway on a Thursday night pretty late. We had just received our new coupons and used them to buy some subs.  Since there were 3 of us each ordering 2 subs each it was a pretty big order for just one person.  Luckily Damon was just starting his shift.  He rushed in, washed up and took over the submaking.  He was fast and efficient and got all three of us out in a timely manner.  The store could definitely use more people like Damon.  He showed real leadership and organization to get them all made as quickly as he did especially with his level of precision.  He did a really great job and I hope he gets recognized for a job well done.  He obviously takes pride in his work."}
{"text":"I come to this store when I'm looking for something moderately healthy for lunch... lol  I mean, if you don't count the sodium of prepared meats, but whatever... You know what I'm saying...

The prep area is always clean, the staff remembers me even if it's been a while since I've been in and as I posted in my Yorkmont BP review, you can forgo the expensive chips and drink to make it a combo and go right into the gas station next door... That might be my favorite part... lol My order is always correct and they don't douse the sandwich with too much oil and vinegar, either... Great job with condiment application...

I like this store, but I only head to this location sometimes since it's not always on the way to anywhere I'm headed, if I'm out and about..."}
{"text":"I just wanna thank Abbie she was the best in there my sandwiches were delicious and she gave me the best customer service thanks again Abbie!!!"}
{"text":"Has a 6\" sub of the day special, order online.
Great service when it's the owner, which it usually is. Pretty quick, even when there are long lines."}
{"text":"i always get a 6 inch BLT and a 6 inch meatball on white bread. Ive tried other items but this has been my favorite for a very long time. Some of the staff even remembers my order and asks if i want a BLT today before i tell them what i want. its pretty clean and i take an early lunch so the wait is not very long"}
{"text":"I went there at 4:30am and the service is suck the guy who has beard ., he is not friendly , the way he talk he cant even open his mouth while he ask u what type of bread ..."}
{"text":"I love Subway because based on my personal experience, I know Subway diet works. I am not a huge fan of their breakfast yet but I think it's not bad to start. IMO Subway still needs to work a little on their breakfast line by adding more flavors like salsa. 

I visit this location a lot since they are inside the building where I work in uptown. It is very convent when it's raining outside or I need to grab lunch in between my meetings. There are three ladies who work here regularly and two out of three are good employees as customer service and sandwich artist perspective. Whenever that one lady makes my sandwich or pizza, it's sloppy... she gives you a face if you ask her to do her job right (meaning make the sandwich right). It's like you are paying for her to give you bad customer experience. She lacks one of the key factors in customer service, which is smile. 

 I still visit this store just because it's very convenient for me and every time I hope I get the other two ladies who welcomes with a smile and makes the sandwich they way customer likes it with smile and witty conversation."}
{"text":"It's good place to grab a quick bite / take out since there are only 3 tables for dine-in. The place was very clean. Quiznos next  door recently closed  so I would think this is the only sandwitch shop in the area specially in weekend. One thing I always notice is the customer service and here employees could use little smile (real smile) on their face which is good for their health and good for business. People like to go eat where employees are happy and talkative."}
{"text":"This location is near my house. It looked neat and clean. When I got here, there were two guys ahead of me. One guy even tried talking to employee however he couldn't get single smile on either of their face. The lady was polite but I still think it is very important for them to have smile on their face. If I had to guess, I would say there must be management issue."}
{"text":"I have been here few times by now for sub and salad. I think I gave them enough opportunity to change my mind but it's same old. 

Their food is stale and the employees are sloppy. The subs I have received here where you can taste the staleness in the bread. They are always try to charge extra even for some of the things which comes as standard. 

Their salad also the same. They are using old lettuce and spinach which are turning black. They asked me if I needed a chopped salad? which I said \"yes please\". I didn't get chopped salad, I didn't get dressing, no napkins and I was given a knife to eat a salad. 

I am this place needs new management with fresh ideas and basic training for the employees to stay open. I am surprised how they are passing the health inspection. 

I hate to give a one star review but this place deserves it. You can check my profile, I don't give one star often and I think I gave them enough opportunities."}
{"text":"I was in the Tega Cay area and it was my lunch time so I decided to grab a lunch to go from this location. I pulled in the parking lot and it felt like a small town/mom and pop place. I got in and I was welcomed with big smile (big plus right). 

I started my order and as soon as I said my sub will veggie, he changed his disposable gloves BIG PLUS. So once I told him what I needed, I pulled out my iPhone 4 and check myself in. I got instance complement on my gadget. 

Everything was great until I decided to use men's room and it wasn't what I expected so that's the reason this place didn't get five star."}
{"text":"This is the Subway inside the El Cortez Casino.  The hotel gives monthly coupons for 99 cents coffee. ..and you can get one refill later!  The other coupon is for 2 free cookies with purchase of a 6\" sub!

They will only make fresh coffee for a paying customer.  Had to wait for new paying customer to get my refill.  

My first cup was just warm.  It came out of a pump pot.  Hmmm..."}
{"text":"This is a Subway. You should know what to expect. With that in mind, this is a good Subway location. It's a part of the nice Matthews Station area, so it can be a stopping point on your way to grab a drink at one of the fine establishments a few doors down. The employees here are very friendly, and I have never received anything but great service. The food itself is hit-or-miss, but that's Subway in a nutshell, isn't it?"}
{"text":"Usually delighted with their sandwiches. Sometimes the customer service can be great, and sometimes not so great. The soda from the soda machine always tastes watery! Overall a good place to grab something to eat."}
{"text":"I love Subway! But I refuse to continue coming here until the young lady Jenny is not working there. I now drive by just to see if she is working and then continue on if she is. I have come twice while she was working and received a sloppily made sandwich twice, then poorly wrapped so that everything fell out in the bag, and way over charged then the times I have come before and I always get the same thing. I have started going to port of subs but would love to return to subway when the staff gives a damn about service, proper sandwich making, and does not overcharge!"}
{"text":"I just picked up 2 sandwiches. This location is super clean and the two ladies behind the counter were super friendly and neat. They made conversation  and gave great service. I would come back"}
{"text":"Hubs used to work in this area so sometimes we would meet for a cheap lunch date. Clean, new location with friendly staff. They're making nice upgrades to the different Subway's and the new pop machine is fun although the vanilla Pepsi was definitely a little light on the vanilla but maybe the cannister was a bit low."}
{"text":"Stopped here in my way to Vegas wanting the Reuben they have been advertising. Never had one from Subway and though I had limited expectation it does look good and I love reubens. So they are completely out of the corned beef to make a Reuben, embarrassing for them especially as their electronic menu flashes \"try the Reuben\" as I am attempting to order. The employees were nice so this is more for the owner/Manager. Also the place was a mess.. to give a little credit the one girl waiting was cleaning when I walked in but it looked looong overdue. This kind of turned me off and I wasn't in the mood to settle so I nicely just said thanks I'll go somewhere else. Figured I'd hit the bathroom on my way out since I'd been on the road for a few hours and found the picture you see below. Bathroom was trashed, plus dining room. I'm pretty sure I made the right decision going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had the place all to myself. The guy working there wasn't friendly, but still he did his job and the sandwich was good and satisfying. No complaints at about the food.

Going west on Dunlap, however doesn't make this place very accessible, and the strange orientation of the sad little strip mall didn't help. Trying to continue west after my little pit stop wasn't easy either. Oh well, I was hungry and ultimately I got what I wanted :D"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Subway locations ever!!!

Food is decent, but the customer service sucks!
And to top it, they don't serve Swiss Cheese, Avocado & Spinach.

Washrooms are nasty, and they don't run the Heat and AC absolutely unless they have to.

STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I love subway, and love their food and dynamic. But o boy did they ruin my lunch. While trying to eat healthier I choose to grab a water cup instead of soda. And turns out, they didn't have cups. Alright, fine, whatever, not their fault other people choose to drink water too. So I went to a park to eat my sub, since I initially thought about eating there for water refills but now had no reason to stay. Only to find out that they didn't put napkins in my bag. 

The worst part is that the manager was there, hiring someone. 

You know, I always wondered why some subway franchises have less stars than others on yelp. But after this, it doesn't take a genius to see why. At least the manager was hiring a cute girl; props to that. Hire a new manager too while you are at it."}
{"text":"1 star for being open late. 1 star for nice people working there. No stars for food. Very skimpy on the meat and veggies. Basically got bread sandwiches with a little bit of meat and a few veggies. I guess that why they can get away with only charging $5 for a footlong. Pastrami melt was nasty. The meat that was on it was rubbery. Got about 10 black olives on a footlong buffalo chicken. Asked for mayo on the cheesesteak. Ran out of mayo in the squeeze bottle, so instead of getting another bottle of mayo, they just squeezed some light mayo on it. If I wanted light mayo, I would of asked for it. Steak sub ha nooo flavor either. Got a root beer out of the fountain. BIB must have been out of syrup. Started driving up the road and took a sip. Tasted like straight carbonated water."}
{"text":"Very nice people. They keep the food coveted and fresh. Good clean standards in place. Would like to see filtered water. But overall a very good subway."}
{"text":"I usually stop at the subway if I did not pack a lunch for work. they're open open 24hrs. I happened to see the same woman each time I go in. I've been going there for about 2 much. she is friendly, she is quick ,my sandwich is always made properly."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible employees, worst customer service I've received in a while. I ordered a melt and the girl working forgot to ask me if it should be toasted and got mad when I asked her to remake it, glaring at me. When we asked her to stop, she laughed at us and continued to be very rude. We had to walk out without our food. I kind of assume when I order a 'melt' it will be toasted, but if she had simply asked like they are supposed to there wouldn't have been an issue. I'm shocked at how confrontational this employee was."}
{"text":"April at this location was so friendly and went above and beyond to make our experience a good one. Great employees like her set this location above the rest!"}
{"text":"Knowingly gave me a moldy sandwich. Absolutely disgusting, I will not be back to this store. I don't understand how you can make my sandwich, seeing the mold, and not say a word. That's shameful and unacceptable."}
{"text":"Come in here quite frequently and the staff and the service is always spectacular. The place is clean and the employees are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Everything here is priced about 40% higher than other subways because its near a university. The guy was outside smoking a cigarette and saw me walked in so he put it out and came inside. He rinsed one hand under some water and asked to take my order. No soap, no washing. He said he's right handed so he didn't need to wash the other......? WTF are you going to make a one handed sandwich? I left, never to return......"}
{"text":"Got a footlong sub.  Had 4 pieces of meat.  When I mentioned it they said that the slices were doubled.  Not.  Not friendly at all"}
{"text":"I'm actually pretty pissed off at this one the sign says that they open at 7 AM Monday through Friday and I'm here at 7:45 and the guys just sitting there looking at me dumbfounded like your sign says 7 AM don't put the incorrect time if you don't want people showing up. Absolutely ridiculous the subways one of the worst of ways I've ever been to."}
{"text":"REALLY good subway! The girl there always hooks me up! She's completely awesome! The sandwiches are always good! Not before, but now they stepped up their game! Completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"This is the worst subway franchise in Toronto.  And the competition is tough!

They change their staff every month. The new people are frakking clueless how to make a wrap. It is all disemboweled and leaking from all sides !

The only reason this location doesn't go out of business is because it is one of few lunch places available around !"}
{"text":"One star only because I had to give a star. My husband and I love Subway, that being said, we will not be returning to this location. We have given it a fair shake 3 times now and I can no longer give my money to this establishment. It's unfortunate evasive we are limited on quick meal options out here but I would rather make the drive to Jimmy Johns for a sub.

We stopped in here on a Wednesday at about 6 o'clock. There were no other patrons in the sandwich shop so we thought it would be a quick visit. Wrong. We had to wait for the two girls to eventually emerge from the back and once they did it moved at a snails pace. It took all in all about 15 minutes for her to make 2 subs and ring us up. 

The food is consistently sub par and this last time...I can't even believe they served the food they did. My husband and I both ordered a wrap and a cup of soup to go. Unbeknownst to me, the soup was ABSOLUTELY disgusting. Not only in appearance but in fast. The \"broccoli cheddar\" was brown. BROWN. It must have been well over cooked and burnt from sitting in the warmer. I couldn't even bring myself to taste it. 

Subway, I understand we need to give the younger generation a chance at employment, but there needs to be some management at this location. Looking at all of the other reviews on yelp, it is pretty clear what the problem is at this location. I hate to say it but you are quickly losing customers daily."}
{"text":"One of the best subways I have been to around the world. Having had them from Europe to Russia to Australia. Great fresh food and amazing service."}
{"text":"Out of all the subways I've been to in Las Vegas this has to be the nicest one. It's hardly ever busy and the people who make our sandwiches do it right.it's almost like walking into a Starbucks atmosphere they have lounge chairs and the environment is  very nice and Pleasant to eat inside of. It's a clean professional atmosphere with accessible parking."}
{"text":"Fast, very friendly service. It's always so nice to see employees who actually seem to enjoy being at work. 
Clean, bright atmosphere.
Good, fresh subs. They got the order right
They offer combo meals (sandwich w chips) with drinks- I like their Fuze green tea with honey.
They also have yummy cookies (chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, white chocolate macadamia nut)."}
{"text":"The absolute slowest employee on the face of the Earth. One sandwich at a time from choosing the bread to payment. Doesn't matter if there are two people in line or 20. Absolutely mind numbing. And the bread is always stale."}
{"text":"Came here for a cookie and the employees talked me into a meal I would highly recommend coming here food was good and the service was fast and very helpful"}
{"text":"I'm generally ok with Subway, but this branch (which sadly is the closest to me) continues to disappoint. On several occasions I have gone to pick up orders, only to be told that they were out of basic ingredients, but today was a new low in that the employee said that they were out of meatballs at 7:30, but that while they had more, she didn't want to prepare them because they \"were closing in 1/2 hour\". First, they actually weren't closing for 1.5 hours, so I was blatantly lied to, but more importantly, wouldn't it make sense to make the customer happy? At 7:30, she had started preparing to close up, so was clearly more concerned with her getting out than customer satisfaction. This has happened to me on several occasions, but from now on I'll drive an extra couple of miles to go to one of the other 3 Subways close by."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible , i paid for 6 sandwiches they only gave me 5 ...they didn't even give my wife a receipt. My wife said once he saw she was paying cash the cashier started to change stuff around and it looked super shady . They forgot my tuna sandwich and when I called about it they told me to just come in and I will be taken care of. That was a lie . The cashier obviously pocketed the money. I do not recommend this location"}
{"text":"This was my first time here I will be back very fast service and nice employees I would recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Very bad services went in at 8 pm nobody was to be found like there were in the back goofy off and bathroom smells like shit whole store was bad don't go there I'm never eating subway again after this"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the online order the computer lost my order verysad, but the food was good I'm giving this 3 out of 5 stars..."}
{"text":"Well deserved 5 star rating for this location and its associates! I made a catering order today and was very pleased with the service with Lori and William. I was impressed with Lori's knowledge and speed with making the order, and appreciated her positive attitude and friendly demeanor. She was able to accommodate my requests and made them even better. While I was throwing out ideas on what combination I wanted the order to be she made sense out of everything and had great intuition on how the order should be made. I was also impressed with the way she was showing an associate how to complete a catering order and the steps in ensuring a flawless delivery, which I got."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd write a Yelp review for a Subway (could anything be more homogeneous?), but this location stands out (badly, unfortunately)...

I totally understand you're going to get language barriers in Toronto (hey, I'm an immigrant's kid myself!) but it's like they're intentionally trying to annoy you here -- you'll have to repeat yourself several times, probably get shuffled between several employees, and maybe still get the wrong toppings (or even the entirely wrong sandwich -- I once ordered an egg and cheese for breakfast and got a steak and cheese!).

I thought maybe it's just me being too mumbly but I've heard so many people in line here complaining about this being a particularly crappy Subway.

That said, the food is dependably and predictably, well, Subway."}
{"text":"A subway is a subway but the people make the difference. They are quick and the store is clean. Even with a huge line they get people on there way in good time."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and for the 4th visit there was no broccoli soup for a 24hour open subway! How is this possible? We were once again disappointed and asked why they are always out....Adam who was concerned, took it upon himself to check the cooler, ended up making some for us. That to me is customer service. Thanks Adam for making our experience a better one!"}
{"text":"Everyone is rude drop your food and when you only have 30 minutes to each you have no time to re make a sandwich. Always different people no one ever sticks around. Because everyone is so rude we all stop buying from this subway I will be calling corporate office to complain about the staff. They are no help. 

Food is ok. You can tell no one wants to work there. If you can go anywhere but here!"}
{"text":"Since I cannot give them no stars, they get one from me or else I wouldn't have given them anything. I had horrible food poisoning from this location twice. I went on 2 different days and ordered different things and I have gotten sick both times. One time almost required me to go to the ER. I honestly think it's because they don't switch out their meats and I'm assuming they are getting spoiled. Will not be coming to this place ever. This place makes me never want Subway again. Haven't had it since the food poisoning."}
{"text":"Food is standard Subway. However, lines are very long at lunchtime during the week due to jurors from the court buildings.  Don't bother getting your sandwich toasted since it will be cold by the time you reach the register. The staff is friendly and fast, but they can only do so much."}
{"text":"Like the other reviewer... yup... its a Subway. 

It's always clean, plenty of parking, and this particular location is never very busy.

I love the $5 Footlongs... can't beat it when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Walked in mid afternoon and the \"Subway sandwich artist\" was sitting at a table making out with her boyfriend. As I'm standing in the restaurant she finally sees me and just stared at me and didn't say anything. Finally a different employee sees me and takes my order."}
{"text":"Why did they run out of meatballs at 3:00 pm??  Don't they just heat up some frozen ones anyways ? Ughh. I ordered a meat ball sub. She cuts the bread. Mumbles something. Excuse me? 'We don't have meatballs.' She moves the spoon around in the sauce to show me there's only a couple in there. 'Do you want a different sandwich?' Nooooo I want meatballs !"}
{"text":"Got to agree with Ms. Soul S. This is the worst subway I've ever been to. Ask for extra anything, I dare you. I asked for extra spinach achieve and the substylist picked up an extra leaf and put it on the sandwich. Not kidding. 

Also, think you'll be safe with the cookies? Think again. The are fricking easy bake. How can they mess them up. Well, evidently as everyone in the area knows not to go here, no one buys them. If you like dry stale disks that once resembled cookies, this is your place. Otherwise, stay away."}
{"text":"I gave them 1 star only because the workers tried.. Cielo and the other male with glasses seemed very new. Cielo was only a bit more experienced then the male but it seemed like she was in a rush and did know what to do either. I asked for a bmt and my portions were wrong so I had to correct Cielo. She was going back and forth not really focusing on any sandwich. To me it seemed like she was rushing way to much there was only one person in-front or me and she made it seem like there was a line or she had other things to do. Someone asked about a gift card promo going on and they both had no clue what the other customer was talking about. I do not feel like cielo is ready to be taking lead of another employee if she doesn't even know what she is doing. Were was management when the customers had a complaint, by the time I got my sandwich it was hot and horrible cut. PLEASE MANAGEMENT, always be on your workers or at least have someone who has know experience training!"}
{"text":"Worst subway ever. The quantity is pathetic and the employees are probably the worst i have ever witnessed. Firstly, it is overpriced because it is inside a casino and Kim was ignorant towards the veggies i expected in a larger quantity. I think the employees should be sacked since there have been too many bad reviews about the place already and subway needs to take action on this issue."}
{"text":"Hate to give them only 3 since I am a long-time fan, but have to dock for not very friendly staff (though one off-duty sandwich artist was friendly and helpful), and less than fresh bread.  I tried the new Italian sub; nothing exciting.  I will probably go back to my usual BMT next time; it has more flavor."}
{"text":"This location is my Subway of choice when in Las Vegas. Plenty of parking, cool inside, great service and never had an issue with food quality.

Subway has sandwiches for everyone. If you are looking for something healthy, make your favorite sandwich into a salad. If you dont mind calories, then there is plenty for you as well. Then there are those half way sandwiches, like the forest black ham sandwich that is delicious yet the foot long has 720 calories. 

I would like to see Subway take their food to the next level by no longer using GMO ingredients, give organic options and buy locally grown produce. This seems to be the trend among the new, educated and healthier consumers."}
{"text":"Prices were higher than the ones here in SD and the sandwich wasn't that good.. I actually got a 6 inch and I only finished about 1/2 of it and had to throw the rest away. Soda refills were NOT FREE! wth??? kinda ridiculous..."}
{"text":"I'm tired of all the hypocrites that give 2-star to chains. I had a great experience and this is exactly what I had expected. I wanted to get Subway and I got it. This is a 5-star experience for me."}
{"text":"Where oh where do I began. The positive is it is nicely done interior wise. The staff well not too good. The first guy sneezed never washed his hands. Second guy was moody because we wanted meat heated up (which is an option). The meats were mixed up so were the veggies like a complete mess. The pickles had mustard and mayo spilled in them. It was just gross. It's crazy because the location is nice but they need to retrain or rehire. If the health inspection came in and saw the food area they might have an issue. Due to allergy issues and just overall cleanliness and presentation, change is needed."}
{"text":"The staff is awful and they skip on the meat they say the owner is cheap and tells then to skip on it and really is a pain to work for the funny part is i use to come in every day and purchase my meals not any more i figure they lost 70 dollars a week"}
{"text":"I've been going to this subway for about 18 years and never had a problem until today. I got my sub to go went home had a few bites then pulled a long blonde hair out of my sub. My hair is dark brown so I know it wasn't mine. I didn't eat the rest."}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with Subway. This location is clean, always has fresh bread, and makes our subs perfectly."}
{"text":"Until today this WAS our favorite Subway - nice location, clean and prompt service.

For YEARS we have shared a foot long sandwich (same meat/bread) garnishing half her way and the other side my way. Main differences, she likes pickles I don't and I like cheese but she doesn't.

Imagine our surprise this afternoon when we were advised by the \"Subway Police\" (Store Manager) that we would have to PAY EXTRA for my request that one side be without cheese and that unused (but paid for) cheese be added to my side.

Hello Subway, why must I PAY AGAIN for cheese that is included in the cost of the foot long?

Subway - not only do you have a nationwide PR problem but your local Store Manager is chasing away customers, we won't be back.

Good news, a mediocre Subway (perhaps same Franchise owner?) a couple miles down the street has closed and been replaced by Jersey Mike's!"}
{"text":"Update/reminder to avoid this place. Per a customer service corporate rep today this store can charge any kind of way. So if s turkey bacon avocado sub appears to be a certain price, they can charge extra for the bacon and the avocado like this store does. Or if you bring in a coupon they can charge extra for whatever is going on your sub to negate the coupon like my experience today.

Con artists so avoid this location and try an honest shop like the Mineral Point Road store."}
{"text":"Been coming to this subway a few times a week for several years but no more.  They do not honor promotions and e gift cards even though they are listed as a subway that honors e gift cards on the subway site."}
{"text":"This subway is disgusting! I found a hair in my meatball sub, along with what looked like a beetle of some sort baked into my cookie. I asked for a refund, but the employee said that their owner doesnt do refunds and proceeded to try and give me a 20 percent discount on my next purchase. I refused the discount due to the fact that I was so disgusted with my food and knew I would never return. What kind of owner refuses a refund to their customer's especially after something like that!? Im never going anywhere near this subway again, and im defiantly going to tell everybody I know in the food industry about this. To whomever the owner is, you are a disgrace to the food industry, and you need to learn how to keep your facility clean and your employees need to wear hairnets so nobody has to deal with hair in their food and waisting their money because you wont refund them for something thats SHOULD have been refunded! In all my years working in the food industry, I have never came across a restaurant so fowl and disgustingly ran. Shame on you guys. Also the lady behind the counter, bridgett I think her name was, very unprofessional, didnt seem to care about my complaint at all! And she looks like she hasn't showered in weeks! Poor hygiene in all aspects to this subway location, in both the food and the employee."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Horrible!!! Horrible customer service! They guy couldn't even look at me when I was ordering.. he rushing me to decide on my veggies and to top it off he was wearing shorts. (Basketball shorts!!!!)"}
{"text":"I have visited this location before but never took the time to rate it. Today I received exceptional customer service by Jacque and the manager Brian. My sandwich was made as I asked, it tasted great and I even saved some money. 
FYI - Brian/manager said he will take any coupon, expired or not from Subway, PLUS he will take any other restaurant's coupon that is comparable to what they can sell you from Subway. 
ALL COUPONS ACCEPTABLE ONLY WHEN HE'S ON DUTY"}
{"text":"It was clean & not full despite being 12:45pm. Brandi greeted me & was very friendly. She started my awesome Italian BMT, then Samantha took over adding my veggies- she was also very friendly. I felt welcomed & they weren't skimpy on their meet. Nice place, too bad it's far from my home but it's good to see how Subway really should be."}
{"text":"Not sure this is worthy of any stars. 2 lousy slices of meat as opposed to 3-4. I figured I'd load up on veggies since I was getting ripped off. He grabs a hand full of black olives and gives me 3. I'm like you can add more he says I'm not supposed too. But gives me 2 more. So kind. So I say ok extra pickles. I got 3. I'm said 3 is extra? He said yes. Didn't give me dressing and didn't bag the sub. Get outta here. Ridiculous. Don't go to this subway. I should have remembered how bad this location was."}
{"text":"This subway is very clean and not too busy at all. Very friendly staff and lots of seating room. Sub of the day is still an option here with $4 for 6inch and $7 for footlong. Was very pleased with the service and the sub was tasty. Given that there weren't too many people, the server was very considerate and took time to make the sub the right way and just to my liking."}
{"text":"Yes, it is a 24 hr (at least through the narrow, dark, alleyway drive-thru) Subway. 

No, I would not go there if I were you. 

I have been there a couple of times or thrice at most; always through the drive-thru. And the last time will always remain the last time. Reason being that I was food-poisoned with a foot-long tuna on wheat. No question it was the Subway on Cheyenne/Rainbow and not something else. 

Come here at your own risk. I would not advise it. - E"}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich and salad. The sandwich was delicious but the salad on the other hand, was below average. I have never ordered a salad before but it was chopped to pieces and the lettuce didn't look very fresh. I was disappointed that the salad was like that and I don't think I'd order another."}
{"text":"Most Subway's are the same, but the young lady working at this one made it stand out for me above all others! Ashley is AMAZING! She was so fun and helpful and seemed like she enjoyed being there and making the sandwiches. She referred to herself as a 'sandwich artist' and she was just that. There must be at least 6-7 Subway locations closer than this for me, but this will be my usual spot, but only when Ashley is working, she is just so damn fun. Her fantastic personality was a nice change from some of the other Subways where they just don't seem like they want to be there."}
{"text":"The bulk of the employees don't speak English... They don't even try. They have ZERO personality and seem inconvenienced by your presence. They even make the other employees that do try and do speak English uncomfortable but it is obvious that they have very discriminate hiring practices the moment you walk in. 
The food is good.. When they follow your requests. 
The place is clean...that's about the only positive I can find."}
{"text":"The guy working the closing shift here was so lazy. I walked in here at 12:10 am and they are open until 1:00 am. We were told that after 12 you cannot stay to eat you have to leave. Clearly it was because the guy had cleaned the dining area and didn't want to do it again."}
{"text":"I came in here out of desperation. I normally don't but decided to do so. The girls here are very friendly. The place is pretty clean and the lettuce is fresh. What bothered me was the quantity... like seriously three slices of ham? That kinda annoyed me ... do better many other sub shops are providing meat filled sandwiches for the same cost as your footlong."}
{"text":"The option to pick the ingredients you want on your sandwich is a great thing. Usually get the turkey with vegetables and chipotle sauce. The choices of breads is a great thing also. Always get service with a smile here! A somewhat healthy option compared to fast food places. Subway shows you the comparison on the napkins. Not bad for breakfast as well."}
{"text":"Eat fresh is the slogan and they deliver freshness! This was part of my P90X workout meal plan and I looked forward to this so much every week!"}
{"text":"I was in this location on Thurs night 5/24..the girls were super friendly and made my sandwich just how i wanted"}
{"text":"If Jared weren't such a dork, Subway may have gone for five. 

They recently boosted their rating in my book considerably by taking a queue from Quizno's and allowing you the option to toast any of their subs. 

I am still partial to the old classic, the Subway Melt, though I have rarely been disappointed by any of even their most boring sandwiches. 

I'm glad that Subway has stuck around."}
{"text":"always great customer service even when they're wicked busy. girl with pink hair was the only one (out of two) making sandwiches. took 20-30 minutes to get my sandwich w only 2 people (who were together) in front of us. went to pay, didn't have any 1s to give change and when they called the manager, he/she didn't even answer.."}
{"text":"Conveniently located near the Metro line, this Subway has a nice corner location. Seats in the window allow you to watch the world go by.

Yes, this is a Subway like others. However, I noticed that the cucumbers were crisp, the tomatoes were more red (than the pale yellowish colour they can sometimes be), the lettuce was green (no yellow lettuce!). The bread was warm and fresh.

All in all, not bad. You will want to ask about the daily special and be sure to look at the menu closely. Not all subs are equal. Some subs that may seem no more special than any other, may actually cost 2-3 dollars more, depending on which one it is. Also, they now have avocado, which is also an up charge.  If you are not careful, even a six inch meal deal can run over 10$."}
{"text":"This Subway has a great location. Unfortunately, they only staff it with one rather slow employee on Sundays. A family of picky kids and entitled parents in front of you can quickly turn a long wait into a miserably long wait. 

If you have anywhere else to be, consider skipping this Subway."}
{"text":"A bit seedy.  There are nicer Subway locations close by, I suggest you go to one of those."}
{"text":"Subway, your bread's trying to hard to please.
Your meat is okay, but you skimp on the cheese.
Some girl who just started thinks \"pickles\" means twenty.
My sandwich was briney, I swear six was plenty.
But I did like the apples and unsweetened iced tea,
Which helped cut out the fat and empty calories.
No you still aren't my fave and you never will be.
But at least you aren't trying to \"Super Size\" me."}
{"text":"I've been to this location on several occasions. It's always very clean and the staff seems very friendly. I have never had an issue with anything I've ordered before. I was surprised that this location delivers too if you order more than $20 worth. Have never tried this service but it seems very convenient."}
{"text":"This location needs to be educated in regards to gluten intolerant people. Like you need to change your gloves and wash your hands when someone says they are allergic to bread.
Also the owner and his fiance need to communicate better. They are on different shifts. If I go in while he is there, he is great and has amazing understanding of my issues and what I am asking for is my sandwich (the same portions of a 6\") to be placed in a bowl. He puts it in a salad bowl. 
Now granted, it's not filling up a salad bowl and that is fine. 
But when she is there, she denies that I have this arrangement with the owner and will put it in a soup bowl. Now you've got to know that the same equal portions of a 6\" would not fit in a soup bowl. Especial my topping choices. 

Get on the same page and educate your staff."}
{"text":"The staff has changed on Saturday and is amazing. Fun to talk with and friendly, been coming back now for over a month and everything has changed for the better. Only complaint I have is they do not have the panini machine yet, I really want to try those Panini's but enjoy the staff here. Please get the machine."}
{"text":"Just came here over my old subway location due to everything being broken there. Friendly staff, fresh ingredients like a subway should have. The guy helping me was fast and able to multi-task very well. Time will tell if this is a standard at this location or I was lucky."}
{"text":"I would give a ZERO for Customer Service if possible. I will never come back.  The employee wasn't rude, but service with no smile or gratitude of my business.  Also, the employee only give me 2 slices of meat for each 6 in sandwich, never asked if I wanted the bread/meat toasted or anything."}
{"text":"Wrote subway to let them know about this situation. They told me someone would get bck with me...hm....3 months later looks like no one cares! Knew that the moment they didn't tell me they had no bread til I got to the counter to order. Off to competitor!! :)"}
{"text":"Very rude.  I ordered 2 children sandwich meals.  My children are diabetic. I did not want milk as a drink.  I wanted water.  So he charged me for 2 water cups.  He told me he was giving me a cup, buthe was charging me for tap water.  When i wanted the milk for another family member, he had a problem.  Tap water should be free.  Then he had a problem with my coupon for the free coupons for filling out a survey.  
What i would like to have then option of water, tap or a bottle water. So if you want tap water, be willing to pay.  Or if willing to have a whiney child, they will substitute a cookie for a milk without a problem. Uneven treatment of guest.  Find another Subway, you do not not have to drive far."}
{"text":"A decent oasis from the sometime madness of the Wal-Mart in which it is situated and yet set apart in its own sizeable space just inside east entrance. You can sit here partially insulated from sounds of the store while watching the wildlife pass by the windows.  The dining area is open and airy with high ceilings, booths and tables and imitation hardwood floors a cut above the usual.  Food is standard Subway, no better or worse: decent and filling if not exceptional.  Dining area is usually clean (and is do today), and staff never unfriendly, and though sometimes, such as today, more distinctly so (friendly).  Not bad at all for a chain dining sub shop, and it is on that scale I bestow a coveted 4th star."}
{"text":"Though totally new crew from time of my initial review still fast, efficient service if not quite the full scale motion blur of time past.  Staff is fine; there's not much time for effusive friendliness when the lunchtime assembly line is in progress. Food is the same, a decent value for fairly substantial  perhaps not comparatively unhealthy filler.  
Note The mini pizzas and fancy coffee drinks are gone, the Star Hut, or was that Pizzabucks, effort abandoned.  I miss only the massive brownies, an exceptional value of sufficient size to provide dessert for more than one meal. Just keep that iced green tea  on tap, and the Sub way will remain a good way for me."}
{"text":"I went to this subway around 8pm on 2/17/18, I thought that the only thing that was wrong with my sandwich was that the bread was burnt but after my second bite I smelled something that smelt like cigarettes and sure enough my next bite tasted like pure cigarettes; it literally tasted like I had licked an ash tray. I will never go back to this subway I'm so disgusted."}
{"text":"A Subway is a Subway is a Subway?   Well, not always, though I've never been in a single one that truly came across as \"dirty\", some are better kept and neater in appearance than others, and this one is just fine.  Staff seems consistently (at least when I've been there) energetic, on the ball and friendly.  Food quality consistent and decent, if as-expected, unexciting despite what must be 1000's of possible variations.  The 3 rating is in no way meant as a slight. It's clean, fast, affordable, filling, offers a number of healthy options, and is consistent with what I expect from Subway - and that IS  A-OK with me"}
{"text":"There is no subway here it's just a house, you people are full of shit! It sucks that people would post a location like this just to waste someone's time."}
{"text":"If I could give this location no stars I would! I asked for a kids meal for my 8 year old. They wouldn't let me have a kids meal bc he wanted pepperoni. so weird bc I've been to subways all over AZ,CA and FL and I have never ever seen this issue.. so they had to charge me for 6in and not a kids meal. If I wanted the 6in then I would of ordered that. These young ass kids that work here need to chill with the attitude and be a little big on costumer service. They have the worst costumer service I have ever seen in my life!!! Don't waste ur time coming here go to jersey mikes and get a real sub sandwich !!!"}
{"text":"Subway is Subway but Calvin was the real deal. Such a doll he was! Outstanding customer service!!! Five stars all day."}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE subway locations. Shawna and lily are FABULOUS. I highly recommend coming by and seeing them when you can find them working! Food is above average when compared to other subway locations. Exceptionally clean, quick service, and \"sandwich ready\"! Quote by lily :D"}
{"text":"Jason is the best! Been to subway a million times! Different locations..Jason's sandwich is always the best! He's always so friendly..helps with suggestions when I can't make up my mind and always jus makes a bomb ass sandwich! Can't say enough good things about this guy..except I hope you're paying him well! Thank you Jason!"}
{"text":"its close to work, its either busy or slow.  subway cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Moving to a new subway in PHX, The one off 75th Ave and Lower Buckeye, Small strip mall and less business , means food is fresh. It all about customer service. Still can't beat a $5.00 foot long."}
{"text":"I was so glad when they opened this Subway by my house and now even more so that it's 24hrs.  The sandwich makers are usually fast and handle the food properly.  I love it when they label the sandwiches too.  Other Subways don't always do that unless I tell them to.  The wait is never long and they keep it clean inside. They always have an \"A\" Grade.  Smells like fresh bread inside too! That's always a plus!"}
{"text":"Cleanest subway , not sure what person above me is talking about but must not go to very many subways here in the valley , 

visit - enjoy - and laugh at other reviews"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst subways in the area , from pricing to out of stuff all the time , to rude employees , both subways in the area are much better sorry subway ;("}
{"text":"Awful!! Only one person working, long dinner time line when the worker leaves to go get change from the bank leaving a line of 6 ppl!!! Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick sandwich and the sandwich maker was just lovely. Smiling friendly and my order was made perfectly and quickly. If you want a quick accurate subway sandwich go to this location in 7 years I've never had a problem!! Also try the spicy chips if you're into heat!!!!!"}
{"text":"Subway is the healthy alternative when you're in a hurry. I eat here every now and then when I'm on the road. The owner amazingly remembers me, or at least pretends to remember me which makes me like the place even more. The only bummer is sometimes I want breakfast for lunch and they stop serving it after 11am even though the sign says they serve it all day. Nonetheless, the place is clean and the food is as healthy as fast food can be."}
{"text":"We came to this subway for the cinco de mayo fiestas downtown.  The place is big and has an upstairs.  The A/C in this place is awesome.  Made my lunch that much better.  They also serve breakfast all day which is awesome for me.  I've been to plenty of other subways that do not.  At the end of the day it is still subway."}
{"text":"I'm still in the store writing this review.... if that doesn't show how annoyed I am I don't know what will. But while me and another person were waiting to be taken care of, the \"owner\" was behind the counter telling the girl working what sandwiches to make for his 5 children so they can go hiking. This girl was working alone so there was no one else to help her, and he was just standing there watching her. I'm not sure what kind of customer service that is but he wasn't a PAYING guest. He was behind the counter ordering his employee around, getting sandwiches for free while two paying guest sat there and waited. The guest behind me left, that's how long it too. He could of easily waited for our TWO sandwiches to be made, to continue with his. But I guess he doesn't understand what customer service is. Hope he has a gooooooooood hike."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick sandwich to take back to the office since I worked around the corner. The bread that I had was very dry. The staff were friendly."}
{"text":"I give them 1 star cause i saw them cleaning their hands after each order. the light skinned black guy was so rude, \"next time you need to tell be before i finished wrapping\", but he forgot to add the egg i paid for and tried to blame me. then when i asked for a cup he said \"you need to pay for drinks\", but he already charged me. after i show him the receipt he just put a cup on the counter for me and creamed \"next\". maybe he was having bad day but i will never go there again to find that  out."}
{"text":"Ok so this place truly needs some love and Chick-fil-A smiling employees. Walking in the atmosphere was so dry and uninviting. The two employees that were working barely said hello and sounded as if they have wanted to leave work all day. If I didn't have my hungry 8year old niece with me I would have left. But my baby was hungry so I had to feed her. 

When she was placing her order the young lady that was making her sub spoke very low and soft. Now think about it, you have a 8year old trying here best to order her own food, over the very tall glass and you want to whisper back to her. Of course I assisted and repeated everything she needed but more of any effort on the employees part would have been helpful. 

While she was making the sub, the area needed to be cleaned up for the droppings of food, sauces, and bread that was left behind. Then another comes in and the young man in the back came out to help. He was talking just as low as the young lady assisting me and this customer also had a child eager to order there own food. 

This is something that really needs to change within this particular location. They just have the \"I don't care/careless\" mindset.

I doubt I'll go back here."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service from a smallish branch tucked away from easy view along 16th Ave NW near Home Road. Only a few tables, but the place is clean and brightly lit. Since it's walking distance from my office, it's now one of my favourite quick lunch places."}
{"text":"It's a Subway. I always ask them to put on ALL the veggies, yeah, even the banana peppers and the purple onions. Three ham slices and two Swiss cheese triangles later, it's chow time with a fountain drink for $5 including tax. Or, forgo the drink and get a foot-long classic sub for $5 + tax for a limited time. I can never finish it in one sitting (you kidding me?), so the problem of what to eat for afternoon snack = solved."}
{"text":"I was going to a program and eating out so I had to get a quick meal for my wife at home.  Subway--about a mile away.

It's been a long while since I was here.  I ordered the BMT for her on Italian herbs and cheese bread.  I had them add a small amount of lettuce, tomatoes, and some red onion and mayo.  That was it.  I was done and even though they had a large order ahead of me, I was in and out pretty quickly.  The price was right and I was off the hook for cooking something.

I'm happy to report my wife thought the sandwich was very good and she'd like to go to Subway now and then instead of the other place we've been going that has a red truck theme."}
{"text":"This store is very close to me and shares the parking lot with home depot.  I vowed the last time when the bread was old and hard that I would not go back!  But we needed to go to home depot and on the way so my husband said let's just grab a sandwich from subway.  And guess what the bread is clearly yesterdays or the day before that -  damnit!  After many times now being disappointed with the store I will never go back there and would like to tell others who might want to go there to not as there is a lovely subway about a mile away located at 7th street and thunderbird andI have never had a bad sandwich there.  It is work the drive,"}
{"text":"Worst Subway in the history of the world. I do give kudos to their corporate regional operating team for responding to an unfortunate situation well but the entire corporation had already lost me as a customer. I thought some corporations would still show some mom & pop customer service but NOT HERE.

Their sandwiches really aren't all that healthy. It's all a marketing scheme. 

Give your business to Corner Bakery a few doors down for a MUCH more high quality product if looking for a sandwich on the go."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the only reason I gave 2 stars is because my sandwich was delicious. However, the service was terrible. I made sure to catch the name on the rude employees name tag that said \"Rowan\" because this person needs to find a job where she doesnt have contact with customers. She was clearly not happy to be there, and it was very clear that she did not want us there either. We came in with smiles and hellos, and got nothing but rude attitude. She clearly needs training in customer service. I am a supervisor at a restaurant and I would never stand for an employee to act this way in front of customers. If your not happy about serving customers, don't show it. At least she could have faked being nice, that would have been better than how we were treated. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Go to a different subway. I had used a text coupon and Ana gave me such a hard time rolling her eyes and shaking her head. Even ordering my food she gave such an attitude. And she's the manager ! Never coming again for her poor and rude customer service."}
{"text":"I went here after my normal spot had a woman buying 14 subs.  The line was terrible.

I needed to get my wife something for dinner and she wanted to try the new Italiano turkey melt.  She enjoyed the sandwich.

Part of this Subway is shared by Winchell's doughnuts so you can get two fixes with one stop if you care.

Service was OK but the guy didn't know how to make their electronic payment accept Apple Pay.  I'll be damned if I download their app to pay through them.  This would only be a back up place to go as the other location is closer."}
{"text":"It is pretty hit and miss here.  Some days I get a really nice sub, but more often than not they are quickly thrown together, bland, poorly packed and barely warmed. (Is that meat a little on the tainted side or is it my imagination)?  They put no love into their subs anymore.  I think they've lost thier sense of pride in the product they serve.  They don't even wrap them well anymore."}
{"text":"I'd give it ZERO stars, if possible. Stale bread and didn't even have my bread choice. Hot subs were not hot...I think something was wrong with the microwave. Not to mention, there was an open pipe and drain that was moldy and disgusting near the soda machine. The kids working here had no clue....didn't apply my coupon to give the discount...a REAL disappointment!"}
{"text":"Drove an extra 8 minutes to this location because of the reviews. I heard this is one of the best subways around. However, I was disappointed. My bread was not soft and fresh yet we were there right at dinner time. We all know their bread is what keeps them alive and more than not the bread is hard. I got a veggie foot long and the girl literally tried giving me 3 green peppers until I asked for extra. They are skimpy with all ingredients but it seems to have gotten worse at all subways. I was also shocked that they no long offer the $5 foot Longs. Just too expensive now for subpar food. Sometimes you have a taste for \"good ole subway\", but times have changed and it isn't what it used to be. I will stick to jersey mikes for a sub."}
{"text":"Nice crew and well prepared subs always great service and quick food. Probably the best subway I have been too and nice coupon deals."}
{"text":"Went in here and the lady basically called me and idiot for asking if the bathroom needed a key. It did so I grabbed it and it wasn't even locked. 1 worker working after she left when a rush came in. Seriously the worst ever, that worker should be fired for being such a b**** and leaving the one worker with 7 people"}
{"text":"This is the worse subway to go to! They have very bad attitudes...... the girls here are THE worse. Spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"The worker Amy needs to be more awake next time she works a graveyard shift since she seemed like she had an attitude and we were not greeted and during our whole ordering time she was just staring at us so awkwardly! It's just terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Great place. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Entire place is clean. I've been here numerous times and the service is always 5stars"}
{"text":"Purchased tuna sub which tasted par for the course being from Subway. However, one of the two cookies with my combo had a hair baked into it. Unfortunately I did not notice until I had eaten half the cookie. Very disgusted and disappointed in this location."}
{"text":"We've gone to THIS location weekly for more than 6 years and it has been getting worse and worse over the past year. Now it seems that 'when convenient' neither of the ladies can speak English. We arrived to an EMPTY store and both ladies were PREMAKING well over a dozen sandwiches (it was 11 a.m.) When I asked to order a sandwich one lady simply looked at me, took off her gloves and walked out to her car in the parking lot!!! The other lady just shrugged... I again asked to order a single sandwich and the remaining lady just pointed to all of the half prepped sandwiches covering the entire counter and pointed to the other employee out at her car!!! After well more than 5 minutes the parking-lot-lady returned, did NOT wash her hands but did put on new gloves and asked what I wanted. When she was cutting the sandwich bread (I wanted a 6\") she was facing the other lady and I was being given a half that was no where near 6\" so I asked for the other half she had just cut off!!! She ignored me and started to make my sandwich so I asked again waving my hands and saying that I wanted the other/larger half and she shrugged and kept working. After my THIRD request I told her to keep the sandwich and I went to Port O Subs. I came back in and asked when the store owner/manager would be in and got another shrug. Try some place else!!!"}
{"text":"I feel like nobody listens to me here. I said I want everything except spinich and green bell pepper. I had to repeat myself three times on what I wanted. I've never ever ever had a problem before.. And then ringing up I said two raspberry cheesecake cookies and a chocolate chip and I ended up with just the raspberry cookies. Dissapointed and wish they would listen better."}
{"text":"Where to begin..?  My girlfriend and I both got food poisoning this weekend from this location.  Today I think I'm finally over it, but I'm still feeling the lingering effects.  My girlfriend is still not able to get out of bed.  I don't think either of us have ever thrown up that much in our lives.

It also should be noted that the employees who served us were rude, inattentive, and did not provide us with a receipt after we paid, as they proceeded to flee to the back room once I inserted my debit card. 

When I sent an email to to subway informing them of my experience, I was contacted by the owner/franchisee (Ilesh).  He insisted the only way we could \"make this right\" would be to meet up in person and discuss this.  I found that very inappropriate, and did my best to end the call (I don't want to imagine what he would have done had I agreed).

I contacted the corporate office to inform them of these incidents, and they advised they would look into it, and advise the owner/franchisee not to contact me again which was something.  However instead of offering me a refund of my meal, they offered me Subway gift cards (sorry, I don't think we'll ever eat at a Subway ever again).

My advice to the consumer: avoid this Subway location at all costs.  I don't want to know what long term damage I might have suffered from the food here.  

My advice to the business: treat your customers better and ensure that this type of contamination does not occur again.  Expect to hear more regarding this soon."}
{"text":"Glad to see a new food establishment in this space that has seen great turnover.  I like Subway generally.  The food here was no exception.  The three stars is really about the so-so service we received.  Don't act like you are doing me a favor when serving me."}
{"text":"On a return visit to this location I have to say my experience was the complete opposite of my prior visit. The staff was extremely helpful and the quality of the food was awesome. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Give it up. Close it down. Better subway franchisee just around the corner. Has one employee working at 6:30 pm on a Friday. Who also showed no urgency and took 30 minutes to clear a line of five people. You've forgotten the only thing that keeps Subway relevant with so/so sandwiches: convenience."}
{"text":"I get it, it's Subway. 

Due to the line, I used the restroom before ordering. Restrooms had the keys dangling out of the locks (like at a gas station where you have to get a key) so I'm not sure why they even bother with having a key. Came out of the restroom with zero people in line, and waited about 5 minutes to even be acknowledged and no one around. When he actually surfaced, this kid acted like he was on something. I had a coupon for .50 cents off a 6 inch. I always get veggie with extra cheese, so for a 6 inch with extra cheese (that they most certainly charge for the extra cheese) should be 4 slices. He put 3, whatever. Seeing as how my ENTIRE SANDWICH is veggies, when I started telling him the veggies I want, he barely put any. I had to keep asking for more, but when I said I wanted onions, he literally took a large handful and slapped it on there. The bread was stale and gross. I know he didn't apply the coupon I had, and refused to give me a receipt. Seriously?? Literally the only reason I still deal with Subway is that it's close to my house.. from now on I won't be so lazy, and will actually make the trip elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sorry but wilted brown lettuce and tomatoes with white or green centers don't cut it suggest you try some other subway location."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've used Subway via Grubhub. Very pleased with the service and the Signature Wrap was what the doctor ordered. Hope this service is available in other states I travel."}
{"text":"Have been here twice, the first time the guy who served me seems like new. But the sandwich came out good. Clean facility!"}
{"text":"I like this location. It doesn't take them long to make my sub and the people are friendly. Katie, the manager, always greets me as I walk in. She does a great job."}
{"text":"Very friendly afternoon staff, clean dining area and clean restrooms. What more do you want besides a good sammich?!"}
{"text":"Tonight I went to this location to pick up dinner for my husband and I. AJ was the employee tonight (that was the name on my receipt) and he was awesome! It was pretty busy when I got there, but he still took his time with each customer including myself :) ... The quality of the sandwiches was great and his customer service really made a difference; To the point where I didn't care that I needed to wait a little bit. His multi tasking skills were superb as well! He even searched for a ripe avocado for my sandwich :). Even my husband could tell a difference in how the subs were made. Thank you, AJ!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this was here. Really nice employees very energetic and polite. Fast service have a good amount of toppings not cheap on it like some subways"}
{"text":"This is a great place for subs! You can tell them whatever you want in your sandwich. And at this particular Subway, the customer service is great! I'll give a 5-star rating!"}
{"text":"Routine typical. Unmotivated team. Slow impersonal. Normal fresh ingredients. More pricy than I remembered. Sandwich was tasty and well prepared."}
{"text":"had my sandwich prepared by an unhappy employee what ever happened to customer service? there card machine went down so i left to get cash and come back and pay which completely nice of me... cost me  $2.75 to get a $20 from an atm i came back to pay and asked for a few cookies on the house because of the inconvenience.. she said i could come back on  Monday and speak to the manager REALLY!  this isn't the first time i received poor customer service here im done ill pay more and go to the subway further east on charleston. .. done with this cramped place no wonder they have to use a buy one get one gimmicks"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, decent food and at a fair price.  One thing to note, I haven't been to this store in a few months and there was a guy making the sandwiches/salads that I hadn't seen there previously.  The store was relatively busy when I arrived and there were only two people working and the person I am referring to was an absolute pro.  I couldn't believe how fast and accurate he was making and handling all the orders.  Subway better do what they can to keep him, he was as good as I've seen in subway shops."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! I waited 15 minutes in the drive thru and I kept saying hello hello and someone finally answered with I'm sorry I can't help you till I'm done with the lobby. I'm like ok so I waited another 5 minutes and nothing. So I proceeded to go inside. When I entered there was two people in front of me. So I waited another 20 minutes because the poor guy was by himself working the food line. The other guy that was there was doing who knows what in the back. So I ordered my food and then the guy that was in the back comes to fill the veggies and as he was filling the green bell peppers he grabs a dirty black storage container that he brought with him from the back and squeezes the bell peppers down so he can fill more!!! I was applaud, so disgusted!! And not just that my boys and I got one foot long turkey sub and a 6\" turkey sub and one 6\" veggie sub and our total was 22 bucks!!! Let's just say I will make sure my family never goes back again!!!"}
{"text":"Ok sonlet me start by saying i have yeast allergies and so me eating anything with yeast is a pain
 However the staff is great. They checked ingredients and gave great reccomendations. 
Restaurant is clean. Great service. Food was great too.
Will definitely go back again

{"text":"If there was 0stars I would pick it the manager Tiffany has a bad attitude it obvious when people hate there job they have no customer service skills the honey tea ran out told me it takes 25 min to prepare so went to get lemonade and it was out also I told her and she added a out of service sign then said the reason the tea was out was because customers usually don't get it and when she prepared my subs I asked for one more meatball cause there was more bread then meat told me I had to pay double I was ok with that but she just seemed really rude the whole time on top of that this subway was sloppy messy and I won't go back"}
{"text":"You know how Subway calls their sandwich makers sandwich artists? The artist over here, upon hearing the ingredients in my flatbread sub, just asked me - how am I gonna fit all of these on there? And then proceeded to give me the wimpiest, most half-hearted version of it I've had. Luckily for me, everyone else in other Subways the last 50 times I ordered the same exact thing didn't have that issue. Some (con) artist trying to get away with giving the least! 

I also get more standoffish than warm service here, at least the last few times I've been here. Will go here less and less now. Avoid if you can."}
{"text":"I overheard someone called out & the gentleman making the food orders was the only one here. He did such a good job under all the pressure & behind the line of people. 
Kudos to this guy for keeping his spirits up & maintaining a smile & good attitude! 
I came in at 12:45 with my mom  
I hope this guy receives the praise he deserves."}
{"text":"This subway is so nice & clean! The workers are so funny & kind. I really liked the girl who helped my sister & I (the girl who helped us was named Morgan) she's tall & blonde & so bubbly! 

She should be the poster child of subway! 

You guys should definitely move her up & get her a raise, definitely! 

She handled my extremely complicated sandwich order, with such a good sense of urgency & joked with us the way down the line. 

She really customized my day & really takes care of each & everyone one of the guests who come through. 

Out of all the subways I've been to, this one has to be my favorite. Thanks so much Morgan! You're so great!!!"}
{"text":"Employee was smoking RIGHT next to the front door while talking to someone. Obviously on her break, but while I was ordering I could smell the smoke inside. Guy who helped me didn't wash his hands before putting gloves on. Also smelled like smoke pretty bad. Lettuce was gross and old and the bell peppers tasted so weird i had to pick them out. Not coming back"}
{"text":"Note: if you have a Subway coupon provided by Subway, do NOT take it here - this franchise location won't accept any Subway coupons. I've taken 3 separate text coupons to this location to just have them rejected because \"their owner won't accept them\" - that's fine and dandy if your building didn't say exactly what my coupon says, and that it is valid at all Phoenix area locations. So, I've politely paid full price each of these times, and have enjoyed the service and subs, but I will NOT return to this location anymore."}
{"text":"This manager is rude!!!! She is NOT customer service oriented at all...... She didn't care at all as she made our sandwich... You could hardly even hear her, she just sucked in all areas!!!! Sandwich was not near as good as it is when I go to our usual subway, now I know to not come BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for 12 years now, and it's been going down hill.......... The latest manager that is there now, is very friendly... He seems to be doing a good job *cleaning* this location up!.... He asks me daily how my day is, it's refreshing to be asked!. Most of his staff is good... We love subway very much."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie.  I pretty much eat here 3-4 times weekly.  I don't cook at all.  Like... ever.  So I indulge in a 6\" tuna on honey oat (or wheat) with no cheese, not toasted with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, green peppers and pickles with no additional condiments except for salt & pepper.  That is pretty much my go-to Subway sandwich.  In fact, I frequent this location so much and so often that more often than not, my sandwich has already begun being crafted the moment I walk into the door.   If that isn't customer service, I don't know what in the heck is?!

For $5.27 (tax included), it is an excellent meal for either lunch or dinner.  I like to indulge in hearty enormous meal portions as much as the next dude, but Subway keeps me on track and on task when it comes to meals.  It's one of the many reasons why I eat here as frequently as I do.  Sure, I could easily eat more, but many nutritionists and dietitians know that portion size is important and there's really no reason to consume more (despite the fact that I really, really, really want to!)  Obviously, I can't sit here and say that Subway is the healthiest meal ever, but considering it comes in a paper bag and for $5.27, I would challenge anyone to find anything healthier at that price.  I know for a fact it's healthier than a burger and fries and as much as I'd love a burger and some fries on most nights, I am choosing to opt for the Subway.

Their store is clean, their faces are friendly, their ingredients are fresh and they are always willing to assist and serve me up an awesome sandwich.  Ditch the burger.  Go grab the sandwich."}
{"text":"Different location than the one I normally frequent, but still the same great service.  :)"}
{"text":"Getting off the vacation review kick, back to some LV reviews!  Even better, this one is a first to review for me!

I know most of you have been to a Subway at one time or another and many of you are 'Yay!' and some of you are 'Blah.'  But this Subway here by my part of town is my fav place to pick up a Subway sub!  This one is pretty new, maybe a year old or so and is the sub shop is connected to a Winchell's Donut.  Pretty good way of cancelling out the benefits of eating healthy, eh Subway?  Get a sub with all the veggie fixins' and chase it with an order of glazed donut holes?  Meal of champions I tell you!  

This is my fav Subway mainly because their ingredients are always super fresh looking whenever I go there.  The assistant manager I met there (I refer to these guys as the 'Ass. Man.' ha ha) said he tries to run a pretty tight ship because other Subways he's been to don't  live up to the company's high standards.  His efforts must be paying off because he mentioned that this particular Subway has been consistently getting the most sales on the SW part of town the past several months.  That's saying a lot because there is a Subway on almost every block you go.  See kids, high quality always leads to high profits!  Don't skimp on your standards.

Back to the sandwiches.  The ingredients here I can see are always fresh, nothing ever looks old.  The tomatoes aren't soggy, the lettuce isn't wilted, and the red onions aren't stinky-slimy.  This Subway even serves spinach!  Rare find in this town, most Subways I go to don't have this on their veggie menu.  I've never been let down by any of the sandwiches I've gotten here, I leave pretty satisfied.  The bread is fresh and fluffy (not flattened like you see at some Subways) and the meats don't look like they've been sitting out all day.  

Personally, I love the Subway $5 foot long menu.  I work out a lot so I'm happy knowing I can go have a cheap, healthy meal afterwards.  One of my fav sandwiches is the Oven Roasted Chicken Breast with ALL the veggies, provolone, extra lettuce, tomatoes, banana peppers, light mayo, spicy mustard, salt and pepper.  Another one of my favs is the Spicy Italian.  I also like the Meatball Marinara with provolone, tomatoes, spinach, bell peppers, and banana peppers.  So good toasted!  Lately, I've been on their Orchard Chicken Salad sandwich kick (ahem...not toasted, ick), I like the apples and golden raisins in it.  And for $5 for a foot long...with chips or 2 cookies and a drink for under $8?  I can use this sandwich for 2 meals, unless I'm super hungry!  Or have to share with my fiance...which means I have to remove my double order of red onions (sigh).  And give her one of my cookies.  Fine, fine.  You can have my Oatmeal Raisin, but the Chocolate Chip is mine!

Another few reasons I love this Subway?  The service and the cleanliness.  The staff have always been pleasant to me and never complain when trying to pack my over-stuffed sandwich (they have been known to be super heavy because of my veggie obsession) into a bag.  This place is usually pretty clean too, bathroom is kept up, and the floors are always mopped.  if you find a dirty area let them know and someone will be on it.  

One of the coolest things about this Subway?  It's open 24 hours a day!  First one in my area, now if I have a late night craving for a sub I can drive down here at 2 in the morning if I want (I sometimes do on those long, Halo 3 filled nights).  I heard this Subway (and subsequently, Winchell's) is open 24 hours because a big part of their clientele are the nurses and doctors that work in the St. Rose hospital almost literally right next door.  In fact, the hospital is large chunk of their revenue.  This Subway also makes it easy for you too with a drive thru.  Yep, a Subway drive thru!  Don't even have to get out of my car for a Subway fix.  Hey doc, you got a heart surgery in 5 minutes?  No problem!  Just don't forget to wash your hands after you eat."}
{"text":"Kylie and Janet where the Friendliest people I have ever Met amazing high-energy awesome I definitely will be back it was a great experience the customer service is amazing ."}
{"text":"This Subway is unique in that it has a drive-thru.  However, the quality of the sandwiches here are very hit or miss.  Have had enough 'meh' experiences here to shy away from this location."}
{"text":"whoever was working at 3:40 am on 3/3/18 needs to be fired. the second i walked in i was greeted with the nastiest attitude ever, extremely disappointed was very rude to us while ordering. will not be coming back EVER"}
{"text":"Love the crew that works this location! Its always clean and they are always friendly."}
{"text":"Ive come here before and things were alright. I never expect much from Subway, but a decent sandwich and green tea with honey are a must. I go to Subway twice a week and these last few days the tea has either been unsweetened (it's supposed to be sweetened) or empty, and the sandwiches were made like the employee had something better to do than to be there and do their job. I also noticed that one time I visited and for at least two hours while I was there, there was a huge puddle of water on the floor that none of the employees cleaned even after I told them. Not even a wet floor sign was posted. This is ridiculous and on top of that the place has been ridiculously dirty and all-over upsetting."}
{"text":"Rudeness. What happened to $5 footlongs? 2 sandwiches = $14!!! I'm sticking to my California subway prices.... 2 sandwiches $10"}
{"text":"I don't usually rate chain restaurants because that seems silly; you already know what to expect. But the staff here is great!

FYI there is a shortage of banana peppers at Subways nationwide. I guess bad weather damaged a lot of the crop from their supplier. This devastating news was given to me by a staff member at the Fort Apache and Sunset location halfway through making my salad. I apologized that I would have to cancel my order but I can't eat my salad without banana peppers. Deciding that the shortage can't be true, I tried this Subway location. The manager on duty confirmed that the shortage was true but that she thought this was going to happen and so ordered an extra box preemptively. What an amazing woman!

Great management and friendly service. Really clean and fast. Banana peppers galore. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Was greeted as I walked through the door which made me feel like I was about to receive good service however the sandwich line of about 3 people seemed to be too many for the 2 gentleman who were working. The care In making sure the sandwich was made to satisfaction was not there. Was really poorly put together.. things were forgotten that I asked for and has to bring up when it was halfway wrapped... dissapointed."}
{"text":"It's a Subway, the food tastes like Subway sandwiches, so pretty good, especially for the price.

The key to the extra star is the service, I have not had to wait much at all even during the busiest lunch hours here the line moves quick, the employees are pleasant, and quick.  I would recommend this if you just want to grab a quick bite or snag something for your desk at work.  

There are other quality sandwich shops downtown with better sandwiches, but not at this low a price and this fast service."}
{"text":"The store is moderately clean, SOME of the staff are rude and undertrained. Pricing seems high for the quality. It's hit or miss with this store."}
{"text":"Wow this was one of the friendliest subway locations I have ever been to! I walked in right @ 11 AM, and was serviced quickly. I appreciated how sweet the woman was who was taking my order. Subway has a big amount of different types of sandwiches. If you don't like the choices, you can make your own. They have many bread types, many meats, cheeses, vegetables."}
{"text":"The worst subway!!! Lost me as a customer. They over charged me then I tired being nice saying I'll just grab a bag of chips and keep they extra .25 cents. Then they refused to give my the chips hey owned me for my kid meals I bought. I go there often but that will be the last time! The manager needs to speak clear English too!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Subway. However, this particular store is by far the WORST. I should have read the yelp reviews before even going in. But Hey, it was a Monday and I was starving. I walked in after grabbing my starbucks around 8am. Greeted by a Man who immediately asked what I had wanted. I indicated the \"Cold Cut Sub, Foot Long\" and we go through the same procedure like any other Subway..except!! that he never put cheese on my sub. I asked why he didn't..and he said it doesn't come with any. Now, being a fan of Subway, i couldn't even count the number of times i've had a cold cut sub with cheese and toasted... the answer is.. ALWAYS. IT ALWAYS CAME WITH CHEESE!!!!!!! 

Nonetheless, I was hungry and in a hurry. So whatever right? Then i proceeded with the toppings. Lettuce, Tomatoes, Green Peppers, Pickles, Banana Peppers, Cucumbers and this guy makes a remark of how i'm choosing a lot of toppings. I'm baffled at this point. First of all, i wanted pickles, not 3 pickles. If i have to ask you to top up on certain toppings, then my friend, you are not running your subway properly. 

Same thing as other people here, They never provided me with a receipt. I had to ask for one and they would print me a duplicate one and not the ones on the subway paper with the survey on the back... makes me wonder why.. 

never coming back!"}
{"text":"The best service and I always came in everyday sometimes twice a day for the best foot long sandwiches ever had in my life until I came to St Louis and it's great service and in OK location... Make sure to bring your cup back so its cheaper on a soda refill"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Subway!! Especially this month, they're having a special any $5 footlong! Healthy and fulfilling!"}
{"text":"I have really become attached to the carved chicken and bacon.... Now I'm dividing my visits between jersey Mike's and subway...."}
{"text":"Worst than Bad experience in a Subway...... serving stale bread. C'mon u spend a lot on Advt do something about actual food served & attitude. I guess this is what happens in franchise business"}
{"text":"One thing you can say about Subway - their sandwiches in the store will be just opposite of the Advt in the media. The guy, as usual, feels hurt when asked to change gloves for a vegetarian. Then, they run out of shredded cheese so he tries 'Triple Cheese' panini with just two cheeses, not bothering to tell me and assuming I am not watching him. Unacceptable. Worst is still to come- they hesitate to add vegetables in it. 2 pcs of thinly cut green peppers and onions, so thin even A4 paper is thicker, and that's it. C'mon dude, I know each store is independently owned and you have been so trained to make sandwiches with nothing or little, but remember, NEXT time, I'll pay  you little or nothing too"}
{"text":"Waited over 15 minutes for a 6 in sub with an eyelash and who knows what else in my sandwich. Unfortunately once I saw that I threw it all up. Lol  the drive thru people need to be a bit quicker with their service skills. I will definitely never come here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in this Subway looking for a Red Bull since I had not had any caffeine yet. I did not find caffeine except in tea form. I ended up feeding my son a kids meal with a roast beef sandwich. I opted for healthy with apples and juice and it even came with a toy. The customer service at this location is stellar too so much positivity when you walk in the door. The store is so very clean as well it just screams happy and upbeat."}
{"text":"Stopped in here so a bite to eat and the veggie subs that they have are great so did not have to wait at all. The sandwiches artist was very attentive to us and reconfirmed the order as he made it. We had to indulge on the chocolate chip cookies too. And then after we ate we had to go back for macadamia nut chocolate chip cookies for the road. Great clean store too"}
{"text":"Decided to indulge in my late night calling for an amazing sub. I am so glad that I have one this close to my house and that is open 24/7. This subway is tucked away in a parking lot that is very dark and gloomy at night due to the emptiness of the massive shopping complex it is located in, but is close enough to the road to be seen. One has to love Vegas for it is a 24 hour town and this is one of the few restaurants left that abides by the Vegas rules of all night rules.

This store is very well lit and safe for customers to answer their late night cravings. With a very clean store and wonderful sandwich artists it's a win win. I was greeted as I walked through the door and was in luck since I was the only customer at the time in the store. The sandwich artist went through the regular bread choices and we did our little toppings dance. Then off to the register with a swipe of the card the sandwiches traded hands and was mine to indulge in.

The subs were all amazing and hit the spot. I ordered a turkey and Swiss for me and the twins had roast beef subs. The turkey was just what I needed to recover after the loss of our fabulous Knights game to the Capitals. The sub artist was able to share in our defeat but his recommendation of the turkey sub tasted oh so great and fresh made me sleep very soundly."}
{"text":"This Subway is good and left us with good impressions. Friendly Staff that listens to detail. One of my wife's favorite salad places she always orders the sweet onion chicken teriyaki with onion teriyaki sauce. She loved it as usual and she ate the whole thing. I had the foot long BMT with mayo, spinach, onions, tomatoes, provalone, oil and vinegar, salt and pepper on the new garlic bread which was fresh, soft, tasty."}
{"text":"Nothing special or different from the other subways, convenient for us. It's a little small."}
{"text":"This Subway store is tugged in a strip mall at the north east corner of McCowan Road and Hwy 7.  I have been to this mall many times and driven by hundreds of times.  I didn't see it until today.  It is that unnoticeable.  Thus it surprised me when many customers entered the stores while we had lunch on this Saturday afternoon.  

We ordered a 12-inch lobster sandwich combo meal to share.  I got to give credit to the quality control of the Subway franchise.  The bread and toppings were standard good and fresh, just like other Subway locations.  The lady behind the counter put quite a bit of real lobster meat in the sandwich.  It looked less than the amount in the picture, but the amount was decent.  The lobster meat tasted fresh, too.

The storefront was clean on the day we visited.  The ladies washroom had a foul smell.  I thought it was due to the age of the sewer system of the building, not the negligence of the Subway staff."}
{"text":"Some Yelpers always seems to have trouble at Subway. Always complaining about the bread,  the person behind the counter didn't smile, the washrooms were a mess, blah, blah blah, complain, complain, complain, Bitch n moan, bitch n moan! What do you expect from owners from a third world country and college drop outs?

You get what you pay for is how I see it, right? I don't expect much when I come to a Subway, I get a decent sandwich, a cold drink, I'm hungry when I walk in and my tummy is satisfied when I leave. I have never had  issues with the bread, any time I walk in to a Subway the bread is always fresh and just baked. Besides, how many Subways can you review? it would be like going to McDonalds and reviewing the quarter pounders or shakes at each, it may keep your fingers busy writing the reviews, but in the end, who is reading them? Right, NO ONE! 

Now I know what you're all thinking, you're saying Joe, you've reviewed a bunch of Starbucks, from Florida to New York, yes, you're right, I have. What's the difference? Can't think of a thing. I like Starbucks more than Subway. I think most normal people like Starbucks more than Subway, but who am I to judge? 

About this particular Subway, they have fresh baked bread, lots of cold cuts, veggies, fresh cookies and oh yeah Seattle's Best coffee, owned by Starbucks by the way. The sandwich makerererers are all nice and SMILE a lot, maybe too much, kinda creepy. Who can be happy making sandwiches all day? Hey gotta go, been fun, but I'm done!"}
{"text":"This place definitely has its fair list of short comings but its over all a decent location.

I like that it is located pretty close to my home and that it's open 24 hours because I'm usually getting off pretty late every night.

I like that they have a bell to ring outside so the employees can buzz you in at night. I think this is a great safety precaution for any 24 hour business and its nice to know the owner cares about their staff.

I do not like that they are always out of stuff when I come after 9PM. It is always stuff I'm really craving too! Like pickles, or avocados, or tuna. I definitely think for a location that has to be open 24 hours they should stock better and help set their employees up for a successful night.

Over all not the worst Subway I have ever been too. Employees are always tired by the time I get there, but they are friendly!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this Subway since it opened and it was always great, good service, clean and good employees! Lately in the last 6 mos everything has changed; the bread is stale, the servers are sloppy, and slow. The restaurant is dirty, with dirty tables, the trash bin overflowing with garbage and items on the menu were not available especially the honey oat bread which they have been out of at least 5 times in the last two weeks! The soda fountain is dirty, needs cleaning and needs to be refreshed with flavor syrups and is mostly soda water! 
Today, they were slow, let my sand which sit after toasting and wandered off somewhere, then fixed the person behind me their sandwich while mine sat getting cold and then when I asked for sweet onion sauce the server almost dumped half the bottle on my sandwich! The final straw, no napkin served in my basket. Which would not be a big problem if not all these other things that are occurring. I think the good employees have left and management is not keeping tabs on the new ones and/or training their staff right. Today was the LAST STRAW, I will not be returning!  
Went there again on Wednesday , since it is so close to my home, to see if anything had been corrected, IT HAS NOT!!! If anything things were WORSE!! I almost threw up when I checked the sofa fountain, FILTHY!! The two young male workers were not making their selves useful and cleaning anything when they had time on their hands. It seems like there is a big turn over in employees, I wonder where the manager is??? Too bad because this used to be a great place, CLEAN, courteous workers who did a great job! I wonder what happened, no oversight I suppose, the Health Dept should get involved!! I definitely will not return! Almost forgot they had NO NAPKINS, since when does a restaurant run out of NAPKINS????
Today is 3/20/2027, since my review I have gone back just to see if anything has changed and it HAS NOT! Yesterday and the day before when I went in, no one greeted me much less waited on me even though there were NO other customers were there. The help was busy talking among themselves , completely ignoring me , I walked out after 10 minutes! And there was an older man yesterday and he was busy getting bread ready for the oven and the girl was just ignoring me so again after 10 Minutes I just walked out! It appears this Subway is not getting the message that your customers come first! Won't go back EVER not even to check on them!"}
{"text":"Am now going to this Subway since the one in Centennial Center is SO BAD! The owner and the other servers always greet you and are very pleasant! They take
Your order and serve you quickly! The place is clean and orderly and the sofa fountained is clean and well maintained. What a DIFFERENCE WHEN THE OWNER IS INVOLVED AND CARES ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS! I will continue to go to this Subway even though it is a little farther for me."}
{"text":"This Subway's location is conveniently located right off the main road leading into Boulder City coming from the City of Henderson. The building that this Subway shares is combined with a Winchell's Donut House, so right after you devour your sandwich you can head on over and take care of the sweet tooth with a good ole delicious donut of your choice. 

Anyhow Subway's meats are OK but I've had much better at other sandwich shops in and around the Las Vegas and Boulder City areas. I usually go through the drive-thru at this location and out of the handful of Subway's I've went to this is the first one I've experience the touchscreen feature when placing your order. 

That's another reason why I like going through the drive-thru because you can customize and get your order exactly how you like it with many options to choose from on the touchscreen menu board. If you run into any troubles using the board there is a Help button located near the board you can push and one of the Subway employees will be able to assist you further. 

If you're a frequent customer the board stores your last few orders that you've placed in the past to really speed up your order you just tap a few options and you're on your way, grant it you want to same order as previously ordered. The only inconvenience I've found with the touchscreen menu board is that you must use a card, there is no cash feed option and no tip option. But if you only have cash you can just pay/tip at the window, no big deal! 

I haven't had no issue with the customer service here. The Subway employee's confirms your order to make sure all is good and usually let you know how long it will take them for your order to be up."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best Subway I have ever been to. Their is a location closer to my work but I drive the extra mile to go to this specific one. The staff is super friendly, they are fast during their lunch rush and they actually make the subs look like they do in the advertisements. I have gone to multiple other locations and this is by far the best all around. It's always clean, the food looks fresh and tastes great every time. Even though it's not located in the best part of town, it is top notch."}
{"text":"I come to subway because the restaurant is clean, prices are ok, service is great and food is good. I like the chopped salads! Family friendly environment and catering is great."}
{"text":"Have gone to this subway twice now and both times it was crap. This time I got charged extra to my card because the cashier Jenicia or something like that didn't know how to work it, please subway learn to train your staff, I caught it at the time of the Purchase and asked her to refund it but she \"didn't know how\" so I asked if she could put it on a $5 subway card \"nope\" 
Ok cool. Won't be back, hope management takes care of this."}
{"text":"Always good for a tasty, fully loaded sandwich :) This Subway is like other Subways, not a whole lot different. You chose the bread, then the meet, and then the other stuff, lettuce, tomato, peppers, onions, etc."}
{"text":"Just your average Subway sandwich located in Centennial.  I was in the area craving meat, but because it was Good Friday, fish is the only thing that I can have. I checked out Smashburger and Teriyaki Madness just in case they had fish options.  The answer was \"no\".  So, I settled for this Subway.  All I got was a 6 inch Tuna w/double tuna and zero condiments.  Because the mayo was missing, taste was no different than a can of tuna.  It did help that I had their tasty Honey Oat bread choice.  I've tried other meals from Subway in the past.  My favorites include their Steak and Chicken Breast.  

Overall, my order was quickly made even though this place was packed for lunch. Service was good and my meal was good en ought to sustain me for a few hours.  I use to frequent places like Subway all the time, but with places like Which Wich, Capriotti's, and Firehouse all over, places like Subway now become an after thought.  However, one thing that Subway has to offer is cheap eats, consistent taste, and great service from their sandwich artists."}
{"text":"I'm not a total fan of Subway , but good enough if you need something quick. Only eaten here once and considering it was lunch time, wasn't busy.  This Subway is actually hidden in a Big Lots and Target shopping center. 

Gave this place 4 stars just for service alone.  Had a 6 in wheat with quadruple chicken breast. Basically it's 2 foot long chicken breast, but in only 6 inches of bread.  This is what I usually get a Subway.  High protein, lower carbs.  I've confused these sandwich artists with these orders in the past so I usually tell them a foot long, double meat, but put everything on one side.  After it was oven roasted, my sandwich artist checked the meat and noticed that some pieces were still cold. She re-cooked just the chicken and I didn't even request it. She knew what I was striving for and made it happen. She's great and built my sandwich with a smile.

I will be back for sure.  Hopefully, I'm lucky and get the same sandwich artist.  Believe me, some have messed this order up before.  Add ranch to the side to dip and it's perfect."}
{"text":"I had to run an errand during my lunch break that brought me over to this area, so I decided to pop into Subway for a quick sandwich. 

My food was just fine (although the sandwich 'artist' was pretty heavy handed with the mustard) but the cashier could have been a lot friendlier."}
{"text":"I usually opt for Subway when I need something quick. It's quite simple, really...

Pros: Staff are friendly, restaurant is clean. Location is right off of route 30, so you can enter from 30 or from the side road off of Clay Pike.

Cons: More of a tip, really. Do Not....And I'll repeat...Do Not go through the drive-thru. Very slow. I have literally waited 15 minutes for one sub. One time, I actually left it was so long. Go inside, they take care of you right away."}
{"text":"This subway does not seem to be consistent with other subways.  Whenever I order something with lunch meat they always put the smallest amount possible.  I have to order double meat to get the normal amount at other subways. Other than that. Very clean fast service."}
{"text":"After running some errands in the area, I had 10 minutes to grab lunch and get back to work. This Subway was convenient for me to swing into so I stopped for a sandwich to go. 

There was one customer ahead of me that was getting a toasted sandwich. I did not want my sandwich toasted, and rather then making me wait for the first customers order to be complete, as some places will sometimes do, they finished my sandwich first which I appreciated. 

Overall, nothing special about this place but nothing bad either. Just your standard Subway sandwich buying experience. I would probably stop back by if I was in the area and wanted a sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"First when I walked in, they were standing in the back on there phones. They did not bother saying anything until I asked if they were closed. A girl helped us she was rude, didn't even asked me if I wanted my sandwich toasted. Her coworker was on the phone and keep in my mind he was on it the whole time me and my boyfriend were ordering two subs. I asked for a little bit of mustard and chipotle sauce and ended up tasting only but mustard when I bit into my sub. This has been the worst service I have ever received, I love subway and this service just ruin my experience."}
{"text":"This is a great Subway. The people who work here are so nice and fast and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Subway because it's cheap, fresh and relatively healthy.  I frequent this particular location for breakfast on my way to work.  The egg white omlet breakfast sandwiches help me avoid doughnuts at the office.  Two great things about this spot: (1) This location has a drive thru so my lazy, half-asleep self doesn't have to get out of my car in the morning and (2) the guy in the drive thru might be the nicest guy on the planet.  He has the voice of Barry White and he is always super excited to be there.  Even at 7 a.m.!"}
{"text":"went here twice while visiting and the customer service was amazing. first was a young female working by herself, which i could have caught her name! keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"There are 2 workers right now. One guy is serving the other is somewhere doing nothing. I walk in she doesn't even greet me like \"welcome to subway\" instead I feel like she doesn't  want to be here. Then this guy who is helping me, just like the rest, is too quiet. It's not hard to speak up and sound like your happy to be working making money! Lack of customer service and the dude had a lady wait for awhile and 3-5 min later the lady comes out to help finally. Lmao"}
{"text":"This subway is my favorite subway of them all. When you walk in, you're always greeted by someone behind the counter. I've been there when it was just me and two workers, and they chatted with me and made me feel at home. I've also been there when the line goes all the way to the door, and there are 4 sandwich makers and a cashier. It's a hopping place at lunchtime!

I get the healthier subs, so it's turkey, lean ham, and egg white subs for me. But it's subway, folks, not gourmet, so make your own rules! Meatball is good, so is their Italian BMT.

If Sandy is there, tell her I said Hi! She's the manager there and is awesome"}
{"text":"Check your orders if you use the drive thru! 
Sandwich was wrong by didn't notice till I got home. They tried to not give the chips with the meal. Noticed that before leaving. Then ordered 3 cookies and when I go home noticed they only gave us 2 of the 3."}
{"text":"Ghetto subway and they dont even honor \" sub of the month\"will never return.Both employees were rude."}
{"text":"As good as it gets, I like everybody here, they are friendly and gives you a good time while you wait for the sandwich"}
{"text":"When it comes to Subway, this place has got to be my favorite. Not sure how long this location has been here, but it was SUPER clean and I mean like brand new clean. All the tables were neatly organized with all their chairs in their proper places. The trash was emptied. The floor was clean and shiny. All the chips and cookies were filled. The drink station was clean and in order as well. 

When it came to ordering my sandwich, the lady was very polite and efficient. I ordered the Veggie Patty sub. Had it toasted with pepper jack cheese and all the veggies except for the banana peppers. She had my sandwich made and I was out the door in a matter of just minutes. She was the only one working there, but was very quick and got people's subs done very quickly so no one had to stand around waiting for more than a few minutes. 

My sandwich was delicious! Bread was fresh, fluffy and crispy on the outside. All the veggies were fresh tasting. The lady making my sandwich made sure to fill it up with veggies. Usually, I end up asking for more of something cause it's like most Subway locations make sure not to put more than just 5 olives on your sandwich. 

Will definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"Passed this location on many occasions when I lived in Phoenix, but just never made the stop until I was there last weekend.

This location is in a small shopping center behind Circle K at 19th and Greenway. When I came in for a quick lunch before heading back, I was greeted as I entered. This location was super clean and very organized. All tables were wiped down and clean. The drink station was filled and all the extras we're filled up. 

The guy that made our subs was super friendly, smiled a lot, and made conversation with us. He verified our order before completing them. 

My guest ordered the $5 foot long Spicy Italian and I got the 6\" veggie patty sub. Both were on the Italian herb and cheese bread. Everything about the subs were delicious and fresh except for the bread. It was hard, dry and the cheese on the top of the bread was burnt!! Idk if they were old bread or just left in the oven too long, but I really wanted to mention something about it, but decided against it. The guy making the subs kept on asking the lady at the register if he should take the bread out, but she said to keep them in..hmm maybe she likes her bread hard as a rock! Maybe next time I'll have a wrap instead of bread when I come back.

When I went to pay I had to wait around for a few minutes as their register was down, but since we were eating in, they allowed us to eat while we waited to pay. So no complains there, especially since it wasn't their fault.

Restroom was clean, but due to so many people coming in to just use the restroom, you have to ask for a key. They only allow customers to use their restroom. 

Overall, it was a good experience for a Subway."}
{"text":"First of all let me start by saying they only had wheat and flatbread. Then, the ladies making the sandwiches were very rude, especially the older one. They left a costumer waiting at the counter for 5 mins and didn't even greet him when he walked in. Worst subway ever."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is subway lets get real on the reviews people. its not anything but a sandwhich and everytime I've gone the person making my sandwhich asks if it looks okay before they wrap it. Poor kids that work there being open 24 hours in that neighborhood is hard enough, imagine how many people go in messed up and begging for food. Be thoughtful, theyre probably not having a great day. I have never had a problem here, everyone who has made my sandwhoch has been very nice and whenever I give them kindness they return it. I give everyone who works here props!"}
{"text":"Shilo was so nice working the late night shift.   Great Sammy thank you so much I will be back"}
{"text":"After shopping at Walmart today I decided to stop here at Subway. Ordered my sandwich then was told that they did not have any tomatoes at all. I found that to be very odd when the restaurant is located across from the produce department. They also said they were unable to serve me a bowl of soup with my no tomato sandwich. Was not happy at all"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Unfortunately the vegetables tasted pretty old and probably needed to be replaced. Everything else turned out great"}
{"text":"New subway in a new plaza. This place is super clean and not busy yet. But these guys are really good and fast.

The menu are the same and no special promotions. But this location is not busy at all, so the staff can help you get in and get out to your busy schedule.

The food preparation is identical to all the other subways. But maybe it's just me, but the ingredients taste fresher in this location. And the sandwich always taste good.

My go to order is the grilled chicken sub with a little bit of every topping. The secret to the sandwich is the sauce. The chipotle southwest and a little of mayo is a killer combo that will make you not like your lunch, but love it.

So if you a craving a subway sandwich around the area, I recommend this location. It's not busy and great tasting sandwich."}
{"text":"Always get a smile and a friendly greeting when we walk in the door! This is the first Subway store our family ate at when we moved to Las Vegas! It's open 24 hours and it's clean!!! Well managed with great employees!"}
{"text":"Just ate at this subway location and was very impressed. The staff was friendly and prompt. The place was very clean and our food was delicious. Everything on my sandwich was very fresh.  By far one of the best subways I've been to."}
{"text":"This Subway location has never let me down. I do not understand the bad reviews. I've been coming here off and on at different times for year and I have always gotten the same friendly and attentive service. The sandwiches are standard but what more could you want for $5?"}
{"text":"Lets talk about the night / graveyard people on 9/26. The guy was stoned. He had his friend in a big red truck out there taking up 2-3 parking spots with his wonderful parking."}
{"text":"A very clean and well stocked Subway. The young people who work here are always courteous and do a very good job preparing our sandwiches."}
{"text":"Fairly typical Subway.
Clean, good seating, fast service.
Ordered the Chicken bacon melt and it was pretty good and filling so no complaints.
Combo'd with cookies.  I like their cookies."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when I learned a Subway opened right in the exact location that I had suggested on their website. But today was my first chance to try it out. Boy, was I disappointed! I asked for no onions (they upset my tummy). What do I find when I get home? Onions! Lots of them! Ok, mistakes happen, right? But where's my napkins? They generally give you a couple in the bag, but maybe the guy was distracted by his girlie that had just walked in, so I'll give him some slack. But wait! Here's the last straw: my footlong was NOT cut in half! How the heck do you eat half a footlong unless it's cut? Ok, so I'm at home, I have a knife, I can cut it myself. The thing is, yes Subway is a chain so you expect them to all be pretty much the same, including the service. My advice to this employee, go back to work at Jack's!"}
{"text":"A server named Heer was immensely rude and degrading towards customers. We had friends in the line that weren't ordering and she asked them to leave because they were apparently distracting her. She later brightened up and tried to seem nicer as she realized we were writing a review. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"The service is terrible, I came here for two sandwiches and after my first one Gloria just started taking everyone else's orders. I understand it got busy, but if you can't handle working somewhere then don't do it. The other lady was very sweet. Them skipping over my other order caused them to have to work around me and they seemed very unorganized attempting to work with numerous sandwiches at once."}
{"text":"Make sure you ask about the coupons before you order. I ordered a footlong specality sandwich and the cashier told me that my coupon was not eligble.  The sandwich artist asked if I wanted some avacado on my sandwich without telling me this would be an extra charge.  Long story short, I ended up paying almost $10 for a footlong sandwich.  I will use the coupon next time but I will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"I come to this Subway quite often for lunch and I am always pleased. The \"sandwich artists\" are always very friendly and my food is always good. It's very clean and even when it's busy, you get your food quickly.

This is my favorite Subway location in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Sucks. Slowest subway ever. Customer service sucks. Be prepared to wait 10-20 min for a sub."}
{"text":"This Subway gives me what I expect from Subway's. It's clean, everything is always very fresh, and the service is always great. 

This is one of those places that you can count on. Everything is always on point. You know what to expect and it's always great."}
{"text":"We always get fresh delicious subs just as we ordered!!! This Subway is always clean and has  polite staff."}
{"text":"I've gone to this store several times of the last couple years and each time there is a new issue. I've waited several minutes for anyone to even come out of the back after I walked in. The bread is typically bad even when I go even at lunch time. I have dealt with Connie on multiple occasions who usually seems disinterested and unresponsive. I wish this store would have improved over the years but unfortunately it has gotten worse."}
{"text":"This month their $5 foot long is the ham and turkey sandwich! I get it with 9 grain bread, lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapenos and honey mustard. 

I need to go back again before the end of the month!"}
{"text":"Great-put the most veggies on your sub!  Nicest staff!  Still have pizza which my daughter loves."}
{"text":"There is no such thing as sandwich artist. Give it up, Subway! They are students who barely know how to make a sandwich.

Owners don't hire enough people during rush hour, everything is a rush, which effects quality of food/sandwiches. 

The food is sometimes fresh, and I recently noticed some of their toppings are frozen (tomatoes, cucumbers to name a few), even ones they put on your sandwiches! During my last visit, they put frozen slices of cucumber in my sandwich.

Owners do not care anymore. 

Mediocre food, Mediocre store, convenient location."}
{"text":"This is the best subway I've ever been to!! The people are so friendly and patient. It's obvious that they care about their jobs and their customers. Love this place so much. It's always busy but they work quickly!"}
{"text":"Everything was good and fast, except they didn't put chicken in double chicken salad. That was pretty upset for hungry me, especially when you paid for this fcking CHICKEN!"}
{"text":"Thank you Ramon! Perfect Sandwich.

Update- 11/10/2016-
This is now my preferred location around this area. This evening at 7pm, I ordered a footlong as breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I didn't have to repeat myself not once to this crew. They were very receptive and helpful. The bread was fresh, everything was evenly spaced and well put together. If i asked for light this or extra that, it was done properly. Major accolades to this crew this evening. Even asking for the upsell, way to go!"}
{"text":"Always a good meal.
We have eaten here since it opened years ago.
The keep it clean, have well trained staff and although the parking lot is small there is always room.

Nice small town with great people at this Subway.

I can recommend it for lunch and for catering.

We have had them prepare sandwich trays for us a few times and it always worked out very well."}
{"text":"I don't know why there is low rating but my experience here has always been great. The staff is wonderful and so nice. They make my experience here feel welcomed. Don't be fooled with the low rating. Its a nice subway. Plus its located in nice Downtown Historical Glendale."}
{"text":"I created a yelp account just for this review right here. Went to subway last night for a normal sub sandwhich and left with a piece of art in my hands. Scott's sub making skills are out of this world, carefully crafted all the ingredients to my spicy Italian and painted the sauce like the embroidery to a michaelangelo painting. It looked so good, I forgot to take a picture and devoured it in seconds. Scott isn't just a subway worker, he's a true artist."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm ranting about a sandwich. Despite the concept of Subway being dead easy, their staff often seem to have forgotten how to make a sandwich. I can't help but chuckle when I see an ad hiring for a \"Sandwich Artist\" knowing that the minimum wage job will probably go to the person who didn't wash their hands on the way out of the washroom.

My problem with this place was only caused by two staff, and the manager noticed before my leaving and offered assistance but it was simply too late. Essentially, one staff was on their lunch break (at 1:15 PM during the lunch rush in the food court...LOL) and was making their own personal lunch in the same queue as the customers (lineup over 7 people), packing on all of her/his (seriously, it was hard to tell) meats and cheeses. When it came time to put their sub in the oven, they removed mine and another customer's sandwiches, giving them a little toss onto the counter where their loaves met. The gentleman be for me's sandwich now had 6 of my 12 inches of cheese on the outside of his bun. This in itself isn't a problem, BUT the person doing the veggie toppings who clearly noticed this discrepancy as she pulled our cheesy subs apart, made no effort to replace any of the missing cheese. I mean... it's not like she didn't notice it;s half my damn sandwich, and it's MINIMAL effort to actually COMPLETE the food you're selling to me. I was starving at this point and with the lineup and my \"really?\" was met with a flat face unresponsive that didn't give two hoots. I was quite hungry and rather annoyed so I began listing my veggies. I listed the first three (lettuce, tomato, spinach) with an open ended voice and paused as we all know that listing all of our toppings at once will lead to wrong/forgotten toppings. So, naturally, this chick decides to amp up the size of my sandwich putting double portions of these veggies. At this point I vocalize to her that I now have no room to put other toppings as my sandwich is already too big to put in my mouth. I was met with a \"sorry, thought you were done\" and NO EFFORT WHATSOVER to remove any of the copious amounts of lettuce or tomato. I list what veggies I have left, telling myself I'll just open the sub and remove some of them before eating. I ask for some pepper and sweet onion sauce. She decides not to put pepper and she puts (and I'm serious when I say this) a good 1/3-3/4 cups worth of southwest sauce on my sandwich. I was done. I stated \"Seriously?!\" because I couldn't believe the culmination of stupidity from a person who it seems can't even make a sandwich.

You handle my meal with no care.
You know it's below standard due to negligence and do nothing.
You don't listen to me when I tell you what I want.
You do nothing to remedy any of the multiple problems you've made.

I looked at the cashier and apologized, telling him that I was leaving and had no interest to pay and eat that \"sub\". The manager (who had been the one to greet/bread/cheese) stepped in and offered to remake my sandwich but I had less than ten minutes to get back to class at this point and I declined. It's a f********* sandwich guys. 

I know how critical I am of people, and although I love to eat subway, ordeing there is the bane of my existence. I don't expect you to evenly distribute the cheese or put the nicer looking tomatoes but this was just a sad joke."}
{"text":"I've had one annoying experience here but it was due to a transient staff member. This Subway is run by a husband-wife duo who both make an effort for every customer to leave happy. They're conveniently located across the street from LaSalle College, and offer a quick bite with the rest of the area being sit down restaurants other than the food court in the mall and the nearby grocery stores.

My only two complaints are that they sometimes close early *open sign on, hours say 11pm but the door is locked with noone inside at 10:30. My other problem is that sometimes those working behind the counter speak among themselves in a third language (neither english nor french) and for me a 101 customer service aspect is to never speak amongst yourselves in front of a customer in a third language."}
{"text":"Anyone who reads my reviews knows that subway is the bane of my existence. I have no patience and high standards when it comes to the simple things. 

That being said, this subway makes me more fond of it every time I visit. Hands on owners, curated staff that are quick, super friendly, and really just well rounded in every way."}
{"text":"Nothing at subway is better than the right man behind the counter! Watching someone actually take a second to make you a nice sub rather than prepare a disproportionate mess is rare. Sylvain! Merci de me faire un excellent souper et de m'aider a pratiquer mon francais! He was professional while still making an effort to conversation with us and it was a really nice touch!"}
{"text":"Went in just now. 3 employees  1 customer. Nobody could help. I asked for a Philly cheese steak and the girls kept talking about who's closing and who's doing the dough for the morning. She just gave me meat with cucumbers. Didn't ask to no green peppers and onion. Nothing.."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Girl acted like she was very high on something. We asked for a large lid because there was none and she looked as if she was clueless and then ignored us. I had to get her attention once again and asked for a lid and she then oh yeah we are out. She didn't even go check in the back, she just brushed it off as if it was an inconvenience to her. She really needs to be drug tested just to have a job."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times this month for Februany, aka $5 footlongs for anything except premium subs. Since it's the closest spot to my home, I think it's about time they got a review.

The service is consistently fast, and the food is just fine. I've also had no problems redeeming my survey code for a free cookie (if you don't know what that is, check the back of your receipt next time). Preparation seems pretty consistent except for one occasion where they might have skimped a bit on my chipotle mayo. It's kinda small, but aren't they all? Only things stopping this from being a 5 star are that it's a fast food chain restaurant and that the white guy (haven't caught his name) constantly tries to upsell. He asks if you want more cheese and whatnot, and it gets annoying.

Note to self: keep getting my sub toasted because it seems that it's $5.41 for both toasted and untoasted."}
{"text":"Update-no drive through.

Much improved-cleaner-and better staff.  Hopefully that is the trend."}
{"text":"Who ever is working at the subway across the street from Sams town club casino on this date at 2 pm is soo rude and clearly does not enjoy her job, I walk in and smile and she shakes her head in disappoint and says clearly \"I cannot wait for it to be 4 O'clock\" while she is serving someone and there are 2 guys in front of me also, going down the street. HA"}
{"text":"Don't ever come to this location rude employees and no manager she threw the sandwich across the counter and assumed we were going to eat and she walked away and didn't finish our order don't bring your family your kids and don't come here if you're drunk, a waste of time eat garbage.....almost slappwd her ass"}
{"text":"Food is good but the same girl is always there when I have gone during my lunch break.  She is not friendly and looks annoyed that you are even there.  I have been there maybe 6 times and every time her manner is the same.  Like I can understand sometimes we have bad days but this has been over a course of months.  I will just drive the extra miles to the Russell and Boulder Hwy location next time.  Her name was Tanisha or something."}
{"text":"I went to this location because well it's close to my house. It was very clean and the young guy who made my sandwich was very nice. They also know how to toast a sandwich at this location! Food was fresh, I think I'll stick to this location. I have been to others and wasn't pleased."}
{"text":"This location is hit or miss with the service. The weekend staff doesn't have it as together than the weekday staff. It's subway so the food is usually the same all the time."}
{"text":"Agree with the other two in regards to this subway. I've to this one before and never really had a problem, staff was cool and friendly and had my orders ready when I arrived. Recently, TWICE, I faxed in an order get there and it wasn't done, they offered to make it and deliver it.. cool thanks... Now again fax in order wasn't ready! Then said he received no order, mind you I'm looking straight at the fax with my order and point down, gives me that \"I'm a dumb fuck look\" and responds o! well if you want to wait I can get the order ready for you.. I FAXED IT IN SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT!!, mind you that there are 8 people in line ready to order. NEVER AGAIN WILL THIS PLACE ERAN MY BUSINESS. Every time I place an order it's for at least 10-15 subs... that sounds like a loss of profit to me!  GO TO JIMMY JOHNS!!!! They mange to take their orders in and actually make them!"}
{"text":"Well here we are again visiting another lovely chain restaurant. I like to eat at subway when it is done right. This location is very clean, so is the staff if you know what I mean. They are friendly and courteous quick too. 

The ingredients at this location are very fresh, I cannot say the same for some of the other locations. 

I will give this one the thumbs up go ahead eat fresh lol!"}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars I would. First of all, the store is DIRTY! The kid making our sandwiches was dropping food on countertop and placing it on sandwiches! EW. The best part is getting sick and throwing up next entire day. Do yourself a favor and drive up the street to the next one!

Will NEVER be back here!!!"}
{"text":"I just walked out of this subway & will NEVER return! The older lady at your location was rude, short, not professional and condescending. I spoke with my daughter about it and she's had the same experiences. She needs to be fired & if not she needs to go to customer service training!"}
{"text":"The past two times I went to this location they didn't have ice tea prepared. I don't drink soda or juice. So I wasted my money on an empty cup of ice. Now I'm taking my precious ice home to fill it with some of my own tea. Wow thanks subway. I was willing to pay a whopping three bucks for some ready-to-drink iced tea."}
{"text":"I was greeted by Jackie & Richard with smiles on there faces! Richard helped me make my sandwich he was very patient while I was indecisively choosing! Not only was he patient and super funny but he also made THE BEST SUBWAY SANDWICH I HAVE EVER CONSUMED IN MY LIFE. So thank Richard that sandwich was amazing"}
{"text":"I just went here and the lady was putting on yellow tomato slices and orange rotten lettuce on my sandwich!  OMG really!  My guess is she will be fired in no time for serving rotten food and trying to make people sick!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately not my favorite subway experience. Ordered my go to sub...foot long tuna with American, spinach, olives, green peppers, and cucumbers with mustard. I got little spinach, tomatoes, and provolone, along with the rest. Manager was gracious and offered to refund or re-make after work (since I was on lunch). I opted for refund and returned sandwich."}
{"text":"First time to this location and it was so traumatizing I had to make a yelp review. I don't know what her name was but this girl (Monday morning) made my sandwich as if there was an earth quake happening. At first she cut the bread wrong and was having an incredibly difficult time putting the meat on. Eventually she started over. And when I asked for avocado, she cut 3 tiny slivers and didn't even spread it out. It hurt me to watch this go down. I'm not sure if it was her first day or if she just hated her job but I've literally never seen an uglier sandwich, and I told her that. I was so jealous of the other customers because they had this younger guy who was literally a sandwich artist, nice and neat. She couldn't even wrap the damn thing. At one point I really considered walking out but I was so hungry, I bought it. Fire this girl and put her in the donut shop. I don't understand how you can be bad at your job, ITS YOUR JOB lol"}
{"text":"This is your typical Subway. This location is located in a strip mall. Easy access off of Higley, there is ample parking. Walking in you can smell the fresh baked bread it puts a smile on your face and a rumble in your belly. I was immediately greeted by the girl behind the counter, and she got to work quickly assembling my yummy sandwich. She was fast, friendly and efficient. No problems with the  customer service. What I did notice though like the previous reviewer said was the dirty tables with the chairs halfway pulled out, and crumbs on the floor throughout the lobby area. That is why i gave it 3 stars, for the cleanliness issue."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. We had a buy one get one free coupon. We were greeted right away upon entering. I ordered a foot long spicy italian. It is loaded with 3 different types of meat, and I chose a variety of veggies. The employee loaded my sandwich up with the yummy goodness, there are a variety of dressings to choose from. I like the sweet onion sauce. 
The restaurant is clean, the service is friendly and the bread and veggies are fresh. This is a good stop for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Seems silly to write a review for a casual dining spot such as Subway - but every experience I have had at this location .. The one across from Del Frisco's .. has always been a great experience. 

The staff is always friendly - the service is quick and I am a fan of their weekly specials menu. That may be at all Subway establishments,but this is literally the only one I go to regularly :) 

I have found myself grabbing sandwiches here as many as 3 times a week. With $3 specials for 6 inch subs - every day of the week - it's a great choice for a quick bite and fast service. 

Happy eating !"}
{"text":"Not all Subway restaurant location on the same... But this one is very good. It's well-maintained and cleaning. And the stuff really take care of you and making your sandwich the way you want.

Every time I go in here and I have a good experience... So if you're looking for a good sandwich and a little bit healthier way to eat. Then you can't go wrong with the subway."}
{"text":"This subway is the worst subway I've ever been to. The people are rude and the service slow. The workers will ignore customers, they don't say hi, they have NO MANNERS, they talk amongst themselves as if customers aren't waiting, and I will never go again. The clinic should be doing something about this awful subway and embarrassing service."}
{"text":"Aj is so sweet and has wonderful costumer service! Very patient with my special ed sister!!"}
{"text":"I go to this location all the time, it is usually staffed by this one older women who may be the greatest employee of all time. Incredibly friendly, and when there is a long line she talks to everyone and apologizes for the wait. She makes sure your sandwich is just the way you want it. As far as the food, it is just like every Subway shop in the world, they all have the same things! Duh. Here, it is all about the service, the food is always the same."}
{"text":"Unbelievable - worst subway I've ever been to. I will never set foot in here or another subway again."}
{"text":"It's clean now! A few years ago, I decided not to come here, because it smelled weird, they said it was the bread, but I just couldn't get past it.  All good now."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to Subway in a while, but my worst experience ever. The staff was in SLOW MOTION. I wondered briefly if they'd all been drugged. It was almost comical. I was waiting for a camera to pop out from a TV show! 

The kid in front of me was rudely talking on his cell phone the entire time he ordered, which was not the staff's fault. He was complaining about the experience too, on his phone, which didn't help. But even when it came to my time to order, I felt like they were out of this time zone. It was ridiculous! No napkin offered and none available, messy tables, and the staff all seemed asleep. 

Horrible subway, but my sandwich was as good as expected. I wish I'd gone to Sandwich Max or Jersey Mike's two blocks away, but I was trying to save a minute. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Food is good, same as any other Subway. Service is great and fast in the mornings but not so much at night. They make you feel unwelcome and burdensome."}
{"text":"The worst subway in Champaign! I gave them the benefit of the doubt and visited again (considering it's the closest to my house)  and got the same crappy service. The food is just as good as other locations but they barely even acknowledge the customers. There is usually just two people working but only one is making the subs and it takes way longer than at any other location. I saw a lady walk out because they took about 20 minutes to get my order ready and were just talking to each other. They didn't seem to care they lost a customer."}
{"text":"The Good: fast, friendly, cheap, good taste, posted calorie chart on glass

The Bad: notathing

The Rest: Had turkey & ham on wheat. Under 400 cals. Good quick cheep airport lunch!"}
{"text":"Again and again.. why do you say your open when your not.. 915 I stopped. Closed ...sign say drive thru open.. nope. This is the third time at the same time. I will not be visiting this subway.  So it closes at 9 not 10. Just letting you guys know."}
{"text":"Great night staff but terrible afternoon staff. I'll only come here at night. The guy with the long hair can't make a real subway sandwich. If you come wait until the night staff is working."}
{"text":"Horrible service! At a dance comp and have limited time to get food back to the girls. Only one person working."}
{"text":"I love this subway for the sole purpose of the staff! I only get 30min lunches and stephon always outdoes himself! I love walking in and seeing his face, because I know my sub will be made deliciously and with speed! Me and my coworkers don't do reviews but we'd like to dedicate this one to him! Great job!"}
{"text":"Just  as standard as the prior Subway, this one on FLW/100th in N. Scottsdale delivers consistency!

Fast, accurate and friendly is what I seek in Subway visits and this location delivers on-point.

Plus, I love this location as it's on my way home from work. :)"}
{"text":"Ok I really try to keep things positive, but I had to stew on this for a day or two , this review is not about subway sandwiches , cmon it's subway really not the best sandwich in the world but passable when you are hungry, this review is about the sad state of their customer service and food safety practices ! 
I ordered my sandwiches for myself and my roommate as my sandwich was being toasted I noticed that the chicken in the case looked like it has mold on it , I informed Tatiana the sandwich maker and she did not care ! 
Actual transcript of convo 
Me : \" excuse me miss , just to let you know that the chicken looks like it has mold on it \" 
Tatiana : \"and ..........\"
She so did not care , even as I said that , that was unhealthy and she might want to change it out , she then asked what toppings I wanted on my sandwich and ignored my suggestion , WTF? I can see why the other reviewers are talking about the poor customer service and now just a huge disregard for food safety , basically what I'm saying is there are many choices in town for a sandwich , if you want to spend your money here please be advised it won't be appreciated and you are risking your health until this place gets someone who actually cares about their job !"}
{"text":"Subway. It is what it is. My sandwich artist prepared my sandwiches as requested, didn't hassle me when I didn't want the combo and gave me my change accurately."}
{"text":"Stopped in late on a Saturday evening and they were out of ham and they were out of white bread. Otherwise, it was good."}
{"text":"Popping out for a quick lunch, I just wanted something I could grab that was easy and fast. I really avoid Subway because it's such a total chain and my daughter worked at one and she told us some of the stories from her time there. Ick. But this Subway was here and I needed something quick.

When I walked in, the \"sandwich artist\" seemed like I was putting her out as if she was on a break. But she put my sandwich together efficiently (I didn't ask for hot peppers on there or see her put them on the sandwich, but there they were). And the guy who sliced the tomatoes needs some retraining. I had to pick out two slices that had core in them. I hate that!

Seriously not cheap. We have the \"$5 foot long\" in the States. They apparently don't have that here. My footlong turkey and cheese on flatbread with a bottle of Dasani was nearly $11."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast...did you know they now cook up fresh eggs for your breakfast sandwich?!!!  I love that you can add fresh veggies to your breakfast sandwich too.  Cheap, fast, reasonably healthy!  Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Well for a Subway it's about average. Nothing very impressive or terribly bad. The prices are great, I'd give them 5 stars for that. They send me out a sleeve of coupons once a month that has around 20 buy one get one free 6\" sandwich offers on it. So if you like a foot long for yourself or want to buy a friend lunch you can treat both of you for about $6, that's a bargain!!

The staff was pretty clueless, there was one guy working the counter helping a foreign couple in front of me that English was a second language too. It was taking them quite a while to figure out what to put on the sandwich. Meanwhile one of the other guys was walking around with a broom and pretending to sweep. There were 3 employees working, the 3rd guy was hiding in the back doing who knows what. Finally the only one really working asked the guy with a broom to help me and he didn't even know his name. The guy with the brook through on some gloves (didn't wash his hands first) then made my sandwich with a little extra something to test my immune system I imagine. But oh well, if I can't handle a little dirt & grime I've probably got bigger problems."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time. Not anymore. The service is awful. They hired a couple guys with big earings in their ears that like to act like they're in grade school. They show no respect for any customers coming in and have no business in the food industry. I will gladly drive 2 miles out of my way to the next subway. Next time don't hire morons."}
{"text":"I hate the customer service at this place with a passion they talked about a customer like he was a damn dog as soon as he walked out the door I mean yall don't know what he going through but yet yall people feel like you got a damn right Smh"}
{"text":"Mm. Sandwiches. I think this is a very good Subway. It smells like freshly baked bread. They are very polite and the food is very fresh. This would have to be my favorite Subway because the service is always great."}
{"text":"D'awwh. This subway isn't so bad, guys! The 1 star review that was written by Dave R. was a little while ago, so maybe this Subway has gotten it's stuff together since then ;)!

Smallish location inside of College Park. Some seating inside, and some seating just outside (though the seating outside is usually full, I find!)

I find that the service is usually very fast (don't let the long lines at lunch intimidate you, they move fast!), and they've never gotten my order wrong. They run out of the flatbread sometimes, which sucks.

Service is okay, not overly friendly, but not rude by any means.

It is what it is, Subway! I come here when I'm craving some quick & cheap carbs & meat (catchy, kind of!?)"}
{"text":"Melissa earned all five of these stars for my review. She was friendly, paid attention to the details of making my sandwich, even picking out some of the stems in the banana peppers! My experience with Subway employees haven't been notable, or even worthy of a yelp review until now. I hope the rest of the staff at this location is kind like her. It was my first visit here, but won't be my last."}
{"text":"Food is Fresh but the Sandwich prices are elevated for being in the Casino.  But the good news is the lines are short due to it being $$$."}
{"text":"This Subway is always understaffed, and so there is always a wait. The past few times we have been there, the sandwich artist used his hands, instead of a knife, to shove the ingredients inside the bread, resulting in crushed bread and a messy sandwich. 

The final straw was when we went to the store at 8:20 PM on *Friday night* (their door states they are open until 9.)  The door was locked and the employees were visible chatting in the back room."}
{"text":"One employee inside waiting on customers while three employees are out in front of the store on a \"break\" sucking on a Vape. Don't come here. Female employee looked in and saw a line but still wouldn't come into help. I have no idea why three employees take a break together while one is inside doing everything."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Subway in Charlotte. Not only are the staff slow and throw subs together sloppily, the guy on the checkout made me want to never go there again - he had disgusting, dirty long (I mean LONG!) fingernails and looked like he hadn't changed his clothes for a week. I was wondering if they had just got the nearest homeless guy to man the checkout.

The food was the same as any other subway, but no care was taken to put the sandwich together."}
{"text":"They got all night and they know it. I could not imagine slower service. The employees actually stopped to have a conversation about someone bossing someone around before finishing making my sandwich. And then a lightbulb fell in the food and the girl just put it back in. Who knows what fell in the food. Not to mention prices are doubled from normal Subway prices (10.28$ for a regular turkey footlong). My sandwich was made by Tiara (that's what the sales receipt said) and it was quite possibly the worst experience I've ever had at Subway"}
{"text":"Very nice subway. I've eaten here on multiple occasions and I've had no issues. Always tasty foods and fast friendly service. The inside is roomy and clean. We will be back for more tasty subs soon"}
{"text":"This Subway is close to my office building, so I eat here a couple times per month. It's pretty much just your average Subway -- nothing terrible but nothing awesome about it. This is a good place to pick-up an inexpensive lunch relatively quickly with acceptable service."}
{"text":"The female worker who works at this restaurant is a great person. She makes good quality sandwiches and is friendly with customers. However, two guys who are probably South Asian are terrible employees. I understand their language. I have heard them making fun of customers, whispering to each other and smiling in an insulting manner, if a customer asks for more ingredients. Recently, one of these guys put only two cheese pieces in a footlong sandwich. The management should either discipline or get rid of these employees."}
{"text":"Their tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce are NOT fresh.  There are two people working there, one made my sandwich and the other one was ringing up a costumer ahead of me.  She took so long ringing her up and when it was finally my turn, she walked away to do something with the bread.  Didn't even say if she was going to be right back or anything. Just walked away and completely ignored me.  I waited for 5 minutes and finally just got tired of waiting so I left without my food.  Horrible customer service and old produce"}
{"text":"As one of the few restaurants in Forest Hills, I believe this Subway gets a descent amount of traffic. I've been here several times, and the employees have always been friendly. They aren't the most efficient employees ever, but they also aren't the slowest. Even though it's located in a very lonely portion of a quiet plaza/medical center, there are always people dining here, whether it be noon on a weekday or late in the evening on the weekend. For a Subway restaurant, it's a pretty average location but would be a solid restaurant choice if a Subway sandwich is what you crave."}
{"text":"So I just came here again the other day and I was pretty disappointed. Service was decent but the quality of food not so much. Literally all the drinks were watered down. I had to switch out my drink FOUR times to finally settle for a drink I did not want because it was the only thing not watered down."}
{"text":"Cheap! Employees are nice! Great place to go to have a tuna sandwich!"}
{"text":"I have never had a problem with employees at this location EXCEPT for the 2 older ladies that seem to be from India.  They are THE RUDEST people I have ever come across at a restaurant!!!  To the point that when I go into that location and see them both working I immediately just leave and go to a different Subway location.  They seriously need to be GONE!  They are by far the most stingy when making a sub.  They speak to one another in their native language in front of customers and for sure you can tell they are talking about us the customers.  

Please do yourself a favor and as soon as you see these 2 ladies just go elsewhere so you don't have to go through a bad moment with these ladies.  

I gave it a 3 star because the other employees are pretty nice but if I could only rate the 2 older ladies I would've given a -1star!"}
{"text":"Service warrants 0 stars.  Tried to order a salad online twice for pickup. 

First time, I drove through to get it and it had been sitting in the fridge for a long time (was wilted) even though I put in the comments the time I would be picking it up, and it had no dressing. I asked and was told \"you didn't ask for any dressing\". I took the receipt out of his hand and pointed to where it said \"ranch and chipotle southwest\". His response: \"well, those could be dressings I guess\" and handed me my two dressings...*smack head on steering wheel*

Second, tried salad online again. Got there, and they said my order wasn't ready because they didn't know if I wanted lettuce or not, since it wasn't checked on the order...I assured them that I did, indeed, want lettuce in my salad (had put comments in to mix spinach and lettuce) *eye roll* got my salad and no dressing on the side. I asked where it was, she said she put it on the salad. I said \"even though I put in the comments to put it on the side?\" She said \"we don't see any comments.\" I proceeded to take the receipt out of her hand and point out the highlighted and bolded section of the receipt where my entire note was printed, in dark black to ensure it is seen, that said \"mix lettuce and spinach, dressings on the side please\". She said \"oh, we never read those.\" *smack head on steering wheel...again*
 
Conclusion: poorly trained staff, mediocre food, and even though its the closest to my house AND the only one between home and work, I will not be going there again. I wrote this note to corporate via the website over a week ago and have heard not a peep back from them. So, done now.  1 star all around."}
{"text":"I have to 100% agree with Brenda A.  I really enjoy Subway subs but this particular location has to be the worse one I've ever visited - head office should be notified and I swear they should shut them down and they can reopen under a new name, \"Shitway\".  I should have just walked out when I noticed no other customers were in there and this was during lunch.  They were so stringy with the tuna and toppings and when I asked for more onions, they pretended to put them on - like it's onions not caviar!  AND, the bread was so nasty and stale - it was definitely way over two days' old because it was making a mess everywhere and the ends were like Melba Toast.  Here's the kicker: while I was waiting for the piece of crap to be prepared, this miserable looking weirdo chick behind the counter kept starring me down - like WTF!  AND the guy behind the cash was so rude; took my money, no thank you, nothing - just put the receipt on top of the piece of crap so-called sub and walked off.  Just avoid all together."}
{"text":"Went to subway at about 3 o'clock to get me and my sister some food.  Everything was going good I was waiting for my sandwich to come out of the toaster and then some guy named Todd or something with a T comes out asks if we're paying together I say yes he proceeds to ring up my order when I have barely begun making my sandwich. I clearly say \"you can give me a second I'm not even done with my order \" then he proceeds to ask if I'll be getting chips and a drink as well while I'm trying to tell the girl making my sandwich what I would like. I thought that was extremely rude because he was being very impatient with us and rushing us out of the door basically.  But whatever I go up to pay I put my chip in and he says \"take your card out now\" I said okay I can read because it clearly has instructions on the pin pad. He then proceeded to say if you don't take it out it's going to start beeping as if it was to hard for him to bare through those tiny beeps. At this point I'm more then displeased with his customer service and his professionalism. But me and my sister sit and eat any way. The only reason I'm writing this bad review is because we seen him walk to his car and leave not even 3 minutes after dealing with us.  And that confirmed my thoughts that we were being rushed , I understand that we all want to go home after a long shift but that's no reason to disrespect a customer and to provide shitty service. If he was that much in a rush I would have rather not have dealt with him at all."}
{"text":"I'm here almost everyday, this sore is amazing! The manager knows how to keep her store clean and train her staff. She's the best manager they've had in awhile. The bread here is as soft as a pillow! The crew are so talkative and really want to talk to you! Plus they know how to load up those veggies! If you ask atleast 2 hours before a catering order is due they should be able to make it only if it's not dinner rush. I mean would you want to get a tray down and make a catering order in the middle of having a dinner rush out the door?  But anyways, this subway is by far the best and I'm so glad they have such amazing mangers."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. The owners were so friendly I had to write a review. Beyond amazing and really appreciate it."}
{"text":"My sister used to say, \"there are two kinds a turkey in this world: shiny turkey and turkey\".  And she was right. 

Which is why until this last week I never ate turkey at Subway. It's not only shiny turkey, it might be the shiniest turkey of all!  But not anymore!

Somebody brilliant at Subway came up with the idea of serving real turkey... Can you imagine that? I've had 4-5 six-inch carved turkey sandwiches and they are absolutely delicious! It's like to say what you have the day after Thanksgiving!

The thing that surprising is I know I'm in the habit of putting just about everything I can on a sandwich should I get at Subway; all those veggies, pickles, banana peppers you know. But with the sandwich I do lettuce and tomato and real mayonnaise: just like the day after Thanksgiving!

Go ahead, try it, I just amended my review of miracle mile deli sandwich at Subway is asgood or better, bigger for sure, HALF THE PRICE!!

by the way, this Subway location is great!  Clean, fast, open until midnight EVERY NIGHT!"}
{"text":"Always friendly, fast service when they are empty. However this location can get packed and service comes to a halt. I can drive down to the one on n. Durango and get my food and home with people still in line at this location. But that has been rare."}
{"text":"As someone who attends the local gym by this Subway, I am a frequent costumer of this establishment. Every morning, I am greeted by wonderful women in the morning staff. They're always ready to take my order with no complaints. The store is always clean and is never in disarray, even during it'a busiest hours."}
{"text":"Well we all know subway is bomb, but what makes the place is the customer service and this subway has the worst customer service of all subways. Because it is a 24 hour restaurant we had to ring the bell and wait to be buzzed in,we stood outside for about 15 min waiting for the employee to open the door after we were just inside of the store 2 minutes prior. Finally he let us in and seemed like he hated his job and we were an inconvenience, he took his time and didn't even really acknowledge we were there. I hate writing bad reviews but this really was not necessary. Not even one star rating."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today (Wasn't feeling the hot pocket I had in the freezer here at work) 

What can I say. Its Subway. Its consistently mediocre. Its not overly fantastic, but its not knock me on my ass terrible. 

Subway is kinda like Olive Garden for me...some times you just need mediocre food. I don't know why it is...and maybe I am the only weirdo... But one thing is for certain, it always tastes the same every time I go there. Maybe it has that high school nostalgia for me. I dunno. I also like stail Necco waffers, so maybe dont pay attention to any of my reviews. 

I get the Spicy Italian, on cheese bread (duh), provolone cheese, light mayo, mustard, lettuce, cucumbers, olives, onions, peppers and LOTS of banana peppers, S&P. That's how I roll."}
{"text":"The salad was delicious. But mostly, the woman working was so friendly. Greeted every customer, took the time to make all the sandwiches and cash people out on her own with a smile and efficiency. She was so friendly and the line moved so fast. If she's not the owner of this place, she should be."}
{"text":"When writing a review for a chain fast food restaurant like subway I'm only going to focus on three things customer service, cleanliness, food preparation. Otherwise, all other metrics seems to stay static, as you already know what to expect before walking in.  

First, the customer service is always spectacular. Which makes me hope they are well compensated. Next, the establishment is always clean, including the bathroom. Finally, the food preparations are good and i haven't had any issues with the way they make their sandwiches.  

All in all, it's a Subway but a good one at that."}
{"text":"It's Subway, so I wasn't headed for some amazing meal (but it's typically not bad, right?). I had to wait a bit for an employee to come out so that I could get my order taken (I think they were in the back). Once, they came out they were very friendly. The place looked clean, but the Sunday I stopped in, they were completely dead. I was picking up lunch for myself and a friend after an anniversary dinner for our fraternal order the night before (so, I tossed some aspirin back to help with the hang over).

The parking lot is shared with a few other businesses, including a bar. During the dinner rush, I imagine the lot is packed, but I haven't been there - so maybe that's wrong? I was able to get a rock star spot, so that was sweet.

The line where they have the sandwich toppings was a little disorganized and looked like maybe they had just had a lunch rush, but it didn't look dirty. Some of the veggies looked fairly wilted and sad. I feel a little bad reviewing this place as 3 stars, because nothing was bad about my experience. However, there was nothing great and I don't think I would stop back at this location."}
{"text":"I really like subway but they have to be the cheapest when it comes to their napkins BC there r 3 of us eating and they gave us one napkin. Nice.       This location is larger than the others that I have been in. Not to busy."}
{"text":"First time coming to this location, wanted to say i was greeted by the staff as soon as I walked through the door. Loved how the place was spotless and everything was stocked and ready to start the day fresh. Amazing customer service who helped me pick out a good sandwich, to try decided to get the oven roasted wrap with cucumbers and spinach. Went and checked out the restrooms they were clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Refused to serve me at 9:55 on a rainy Tuesday night claiming they were closed. Sign says they close at 10. Shit service."}
{"text":"Wost sandwich I have had in a really long time. The women that work at this location don't even greet you or look you in your eyes. The owner is never there.. The sandwich making area was filthy!!! This location is  horrendous and to conclude this write up stay away from this nasty location unless you want a sandwich with no meat, veggies, and attitude to go along with it."}
{"text":"Went in to get sandwiches with my two kids today and the lady making my sandwich dropped the F-bomb twice while complaining about how long her night out was and how she couldn't wait to get off work. I tried to ignore it the first time but when she did it a second time, I had to take my kids and leave without my sandwich. Not a family friendly establishment."}
{"text":"Great subs! Longs lines at peak times but still move fast and efficiently. Employees smile and greet just about everyone that walks in. My all time favorite is still the meatball sub on wheat."}
{"text":"Aida was so monotone and horribly rude. Rushed our order through and was annoyed. We weren't greeted at all. We walked in and moments later she came out of the bathroom and went behind the counter and said \"what size and what bread\"."}
{"text":"All of the vegetables were almost frozen, and there was ice forming on the containers around the meats. Little strange. I got my veggie patty toasted, which turned out okay, but I wanted to eat it as quickly as possible before the shame settled in. 

It's pretty hard to be vegetarian on the go, but I am glad this place accommodates. 

They also take coupons from competitor restaurants, as well as any old or expired coupons from subway in the years past. I remember when they had punch cards for a free sub -- I could have used them here!!! :)"}
{"text":"I frequent this subway quite a bit. It's very close to my house and in the middle of everything. It's attached to a BP gas station so that's also very convenient. It's separated by chest high partitions from the gas station and there are a few chairs and tables to dine in. There's also a tv! 

The carnivore in me needed a sammich so I went for the sub of the month for $6... the Steak and Cheese! Steak, pepper jack, spinach, banana peppers, tomato and chipotle southwest sauce.  Everything was hot and hot the spot and I don't know who(tall gentleman with taped glasses) took care of me but he did a great job as well! He was fast, polite, efficient and grateful. I think at this point I'd like to iterate the importance of gratuity when deserved. Even fast food and fast casual. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday around 3pm & got the spicy Italian. Around 7pm I started feeling sick and nauseas, 8pm came around and I was vomiting so much. I am very sick, nauseas, and am starting to feel dehydrated. This was the only meal I had for the day. I feel grossed out just thinking about their sandwiches."}
{"text":"The other day I decided to go to Subway. I'm not a fan of Subway but I had a coupon and I'm trying to eat healthy and it was close.  I looked up the time they close and it said 10pm so I headed over. I get there around 9:25 pm and the open sign is off and some kid is mopping the floor. He sees me and points at the open sign as if to say we're closed. So I point at my wrist basically saying it's too early to close. He shrugs his shoulders and laughs and keeps on mopping. 

I called corporate who documented that they were closing outside of their available hours and also the rudeness of the employee. They said the franchisee would get back to me in a few day's but I never heard from them. So I called corporate back to let them know. I have a feeling that the way this place runs it will be out of business quick. 

There are Subways on almost every block. I've never had an experience like this at one. I highly recommend avoiding this Subway like the plague!"}
{"text":"How do you have one employee working at 5PM took 19 minutes to get a sub. The employee was super nice and great and it wasn't her fault."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé avec tante Pierrette, beaucoup de plaisir!!!!!!! J'ai pris un sandwich poulet grillé avec sauce ranch vrm bon, quelques légumes (pas de piments fort) ma tante a pris autre chose ca avait lair bon elle a dit que c'était bon je me souviens pu cest quoi mais dinde je pense......je recommande à tous! Le vendeur était très aimable, beaucoup de sourire dans la pièce, on se sent chez nous, ambiance feutrée et chic j'ai aimé mon expérience prochaine fois jy vais avec mononcle jean"}
{"text":"Love this subway won't go to any other one!! The staff is so nice and this place is very clean compared to most of the other subways in the area ! Great food , they always have fresh baked cookies and bread , tons of choices of chips, drinks, and they even have soup all year round!! Very impressed with this place, would recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"I love eating at subway. They make great sandwiches. They will toast your bread and cheese and the foot Kong's are my favorite I usually get an Italian Footlong with pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, bana peppers, jalapeños, and southwest sauce"}
{"text":"Employees are rude. Put my sandwich together like crap and when I opened it it was a mess. If these many people are complaining about the same thing subway should fire these people. Terrible."}
{"text":"Finally they have an employee named Willie he fixed me a steak and cheese sandwich. He offered to Heat up the meat with some green peppers which I never tried and it worked.  He put the dressing on my sandwich the way I like it in the way apparently he likes it. I want to thank Willie for making my sandwich.

The other employees that would make my sandwich used to make it all wrong I stop fighting with them I would just take the sandwich and throat right into the trashcan but Willie did a great job the owner of the Subway needs to recognize that he's a good employee"}
{"text":"I love this Subway location because they have pastrami! The employees are always friendly too! If you're ever in the area and want great service (and pastrami) or any other sub go here!"}
{"text":"Deshawn was making my sandwhich the other day and made it to perfection. He was nice and i appreciated that he didnt over due the mayo or mustard. Im coming back to this one for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this Subway location. The employees provide magnificent customer service. The sandwich so fresh! The sub of the day was a very reasonable deal. This Subway location was very clean. Great music too by the way. Will stop by again."}
{"text":"Subway does a marvelous job at making delicious sandwiches. The employees show enthusiasm and passion in their job. They provide great customer service. The restaurant is always clean and it's a great place to go for lunch or dinner. Thank you for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"So we have all been to our share of Subways,some bad some good. But this place really sets the standards very high. I am very big on cleanliness and this place is top notch. The staff were all very friendly even at the end of the night. The bread is very different than that of others very fresh and fluffy. Love it. I will be returning here time after time and telling all my friends about this subway."}
{"text":"They always get my order wrong. I asked for a pastrami is was cold. She didn't heat it in the microwave. The veggies aren't fresh."}
{"text":"We were headed to the mountains to play in the snow, so we needed to grab lunch early.  They were open promptly at 8 am and prepared to assemble our sandwiches."}
{"text":"Place was very clean. Tried the new Turkey/bacon guacamole sub very good. Mark was over nice and very good about  customer service. Thank for having the different teas. Like how they have all the chips displayed. Table over a Subway supervisor was going over scores with store manager on rankings of the store. By the way the Biscuits and Gravy chip were great."}
{"text":"It was clean.. Food is fresh and the people that work there are very nice, fast and efficient!!"}
{"text":"This subway is conveniently located in the Walmart shopping plaza by Panera Bread, and Panda Express. I usually visit this location after the gym when I am to exhausted to cook dinner for the night, but from my recent experience I will just go to Panera instead. I often visit the store two hours before closing and there is no line. 

The store is somewhat clean but I feel that it could be a lot cleaner. The employees are somewhat nice because they greet you when you come in but hold little to no conversation with you while they are fixing your food. On my recent visit they were out of turkey. How does a sandwich place that specializes  in sandwiches don't have turkey. The employee told me this after I was half way done with my finances order.

On my most recent visit I felt as if I had received horrible customer service and the women simply hated her job. Other times I have visited this location and their was a man working and he was so nice and friendly and the restaurant was always clean.  

I am unsure if I will ever return to this location."}
{"text":"I actually didnt know there was a subway in Park Rd Shopping Center. I'm not a big subway fan but stopped by for breakfast one morning.  It was dead. I am surprised they can compete with the other breakfast and lunch places around. 

The breakfast flat bread was okay. Inline with everything Subway sells so the selling point of the breakfast was how low the calories were. They have several options for under 200 calories.  Im telling you the next time Im on the road and need something fast, Im going to stop by Subway and save the extra calories for lunch."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst Subway locations I have been to. The one by my work is top notch, but this one is like where all the subway employee rejects work. Every time I have gone here (which has been many times as its practically walking distance from my house) the customer service has been poor. We are never greeted when we walk in the door and the 'sandwich artists' always look like they are hating life. A couple weeks ago there was a girl that was sick as hell making our sandwiches while the completely healthy one was on the register. This girl was wiping her nose with her sleeve while making our sandwiches, it was disgusting. I feel like I was eating the plague when I got home, I couldn't even finish my meal. I understand you can't be understaffed at a place like this, but at least have this sicky working the register instead of working with your food. I go here when it sounds good, but the customer service is just bad. I dont always expect a smile when I am out, but at least dont give me dirty looks while you make my sandwich."}
{"text":"Came here last night around 11 pm. I can't seem to remember if the girl that helped me out name was marlene or something with an (M) anyways. She was extremely friendly and very nice. She is the nicest employee at this location that works there and has helped me out. Awesome customer service."}
{"text":"There's rude, then there's what I just experienced!! Stopped at this subway at 4:45 on Monday, 11/13/17. Tried to order a 12\" sub and a salad to go. The \"lady\" that attempted to wait on me was unbelievably rude and condescending. Even though I recently just moved to within 5 minutes of this place, I will NEVER give them any of my business, especially if that's the type of people they employ! Also, the repercussions don't stop with me or this review as there was an older couple sitting in the restaurant that observed this rudeness as well."}
{"text":"This place barely deserves 1 star, only because it looks clean inside. 
This is the slowest subway I've ever experienced and the staff doesn't seem to care. The first time I thought they might have had a call out or the staff was new, but after revisiting several times it's always the same. Reading the other reviews shows it's an obvious problem. 
-- I'll gladly drive across town before going here again"}
{"text":"This Subway location probably isn't going to be here much longer. At least they aren't if they keep closing shop EARLY, before the  posted closing time of 2am, wait no, 1am, wait no, is it 12am when they close? I DON'T KNOW and I don't think I ever will because every time I ask, it's a different time! 
The smug excuse of an employee who worked the night of memorial day 5/29/17 couldn't even answer me when I asked what time they closed. Probably the same guy from a previous Google review (Mr. \"Anything else\"). If this franchise owner wants to keep this location open for more than a few more months, they need to get rid of employees who exude the attitude of \"I hate my job\" and be consistent with their business hours."}
{"text":"This location used to be great, then something happened and it is no longer great. 

This is the second time we have tried this shop since there was some kind of management change I'm guessing?  It was the second time we have been disappointed. There  won't be a third. The first, we asked for no cheese on one sandwich and to put that sandwiches cheese on the second sandwich. They said they couldn't do that, we had to pay for extra cheese. Ok...so forget it i told them, put cheese on both like normal. I will remove cheese from one sandwich myself and add to the other sandwich. Seriously, it's not about how the cheese is put on the sandwich, as it is about the inventory count. 

 Today, I ordered a child's meal, and a cookie and a 6 inch turkey club. I get order, walk a out the door to my car and realize the cookie is missing. Go back inside and there is a line now. I tell the cashier they forgot the cookie. He said, oh well I didn't ring it up, I can ring it up after I'm done helping these guys...


Uum no. U forgot to do it in the first place.  You don't make a customer wait again for something you forgot,  especially something so small as a cookie l. 

I also never asked for oregano. But because the sandwich was already completed I said that's fine just leave it. Too bad the same courtesy could not be extended to me when I came back in for the missing cookie. \"I'm so sorry I forgot to ring that up, here is a cookie on me\" (Said the cashier, for example)."}
{"text":"$11 foot long. 30 minute wait. Register lady tried every upsale they offer (double meat, cookies, drink, water, etc).  Sandwich was good though. Thus the two stars."}
{"text":"Please DO NOT go here!!! 

There was a bug in the ice machine, when it was brought to the attention of the store manager, she cared less. Now mind you, it was not \"caught\" in the machine, it was actually dispensed through the ice machine ... super gross. I wonder when they cleaned it last. 

The store manager talks down to her employees in front of the customers and treats them like dirt. They must be hurting for money as the subs don't even come close to the descriptions provided. For example, \"sandwiches get two slices of meat, not three; don't over fill the scoop on the steak scooper\".

She also backs her SUV at the front door and takes ups space for customers to park in. 

If you like Subway, there is one off of Shea that is way better (although they only have soup during the winter time)."}
{"text":"Been there over 10 times, the first 5 we're good times, the last 4 we're good and bad and the last time was horrible (bad bread, the meat had an horrible odor, it was inedible & deleterious to my health. Also the customer service was horrible & the food was so bad, I had to return it back"}
{"text":"This is the worst subway I've ever experienced. They usually only have one person working so it takes a very long time to order anything if there is any sort of line. One time after waiting 20 minutes to even begin to order I wanted a steak and cheese sandwich but they were out of steak, so I wanted a meatball sandwich instead but they only had cold meatballs. I decided to just leave and never come back. I recently saw they got a B rating from the health department. Yikes!"}
{"text":"I like this location because it stays moderately busy w/ super fast service.  I don't know the business hours, but they are open very late.  The restaurant is always clean, and staff is friendly.  Never no more than 5mins from start to finish, go check them out."}
{"text":"HELL NAH! If I could rate a ZERO or NEGATIVE 100 that would be my rating.  Something told me I should've just made the drive down the street and went to me REGULAR location.  I never have these type of problems at the Subway up the street from Target, and they are open 24hrs.

So on to this raggedy ass location, late night washing at the laundry mat, I was hungry when I left the house but I figured I was only drying clothes so I can hold on for 30mins. Big mistake, 9:30pm what I was in the mood for was closed, and a cheesebuger, taco, pizza, etc just wasn't the palete pleasing meal that I wanted.  So where do you go in a time of some \"FRESH FOOD\" eating? SUBWAY, that's their slogan 'Subway eat FRESH!'...well my meal was NOT FU@%!N$ FRESH and now I see why all 3 reviews written for this location is 1STAR and if they could they probably would rate ZERO too.

I get there 30mins before closing, attitude sucked, lack of personality, NO customer service whatsoever.  I don't care that you're in a rush to go home, you applied to work at Subway, I know the struggle, once upon a time I was also a Sandwich Artist, so miss me w/ the speech on how long it takes you to clean up.  How about you good back there an prep for some bread for proof for the next day b/c my bread was STALE and damn near crunchy.

ONE OF MY BIGGEST PET PEEVES: if I ask for something outside of the normal, I am freaking aware that there is an extra charge.

I asked: Can you add avocado to that for me please (now this is before I knew about the stale bread)

HIS response: well that's gonna cost you $0.75

What pissed me off is that he stopped making my sandwich and gave me a crazy look when he said, so I SNAPPED!. \"No $h!t Sherlock, it's listed on the menu as EXTRA w/ the price to the left, ol' dumba$$.  Did I ask you how does it cost, no I said can you add avocado to my sandwich and I said PLEASE\"  I promise if he could spit in my sandwich right he would've.

So I finally get back to the laundromat w/ my sandwich in hand, my stomach is screaming at me, I unwrap my sandwich and it's in 2 PIECES!  No, if that was I would have gone to Jimmy John's...ok, actually I did go to Jimmy John's but they  had closed at 9pm :-("}
{"text":"Went in and the manager was so rude my husband had a coupon he hit redeem on his phone right in front of the manager and the manager said well I didn't see it so I won't give you the deal my husband said you know you cant hit redeem again he said oh well looks like you have a piece of crap phone and he refused to give his name but he was a manager, this place has the worst customer service!"}
{"text":"Average subway. Food was ok . I hate the remodel design of the sandwich area and not sure how I feel about the baskets.  Crew members really need some training in customers service.  They weren't rude persay but it was lacking."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a freaking Subway. What do you want? I wouldn't have reviewed this place had I not realized that I haven't reviewed anything in well over a month. As a normal American, I get the hankering for fast food from time to time. And \"from time to time,\" I mean pretty much all the time. But lately instead of gobbling down a burger or entire large pizza, I've been hitting this place for (of all things) the five-dollar veggie sub. Unlike the previous reviewer, they've always piled on the toppings for me without me even asking. Plus they're nice, and this is a good location to hit maybe after the library or buying malt liquor across the street at Discount Drug Mart."}
{"text":"Store closes at 9 and the idiot manager hasn't even updated it on his own window. Then says we're wrong while we're standing outside"}
{"text":"Not sure what the other review has to do with this subway.   This one is a great improvement to the store that was in this shopping mall previously.   The kids that run it do a good job of moving the customers.   With $5 sandwiches it's always busy.   The bread and ingredients seem fresh each time we have had lunch...."}
{"text":"Thank heavens this Subway is still in Biz.    The staff is a rotation of kids, but the sandwich and bread never fail.    Thanks subway for your $5 promo."}
{"text":"If you have the time please drive to a different subway.   This subway does not clean their knives when cutting sandwiches...dried food left on knife. Skimp on everything placed on sandwich, and for some reason water was pouring from my sandwich..now sure if it was from the meat or veges.   Also if you do eat here watch your receipt. I was overcharged... If you get cookies they charge for chips and single cookie which works out to .15 more - I know it's not much but times that by how many people and subway is making themselves a little profit. Friend got soup and we are not sure if she was overcharged because they do not have their soup prices listed....seriously needs a health inspector to go through this subway."}
{"text":"Hi. We were there last week and the employees there were very patient and kind with us as my 2 kids kept changing their minds about their drinks and food :) The cashier , David was very professional and patient as well!!!! Thank you for your services!"}
{"text":"By far the worst place I've ever been served food in my life. After waiting for the employee to finnish her cigarette outside while staring at me. She proceeded to come in and out gloves on. After asking if she was going to wash her hands she rolled her eyes at me and acknowledged she was watching me stand here while she was outside. She was cold and slapped every piece of meat onto the bread. Stared at me while putting toppings on and then answered her cell phone while ringing up my total. In all of my years as a human being I have never been treated like this. I know I'm flying into Cleveland and everything but holy hell. The only reason you have my business today is out of desperation of not estting in the last 24 hours because of travel."}
{"text":"Worst location ever!  Drive an extra mile and go to the one on Sarival and Yuma instead.  Seriously.  

1.  6pm at night and they don't have Italian bread and specifically said they aren't making anymore.  

2.  I ordered a foot long BLT.  The dude puts 4 little pieces of bacon on it.  Now I've been ordering the same sandwich for like 20 years and always get 8 pieces of bacon.  Dude said they always only do 4 so I have to pay extra.  Fine, it's $1.50 for extra bacon, whatever.  I really wasn't in a mood to argue.  

3.  I ask for it NOT to be toasted, dude is training a girl and is explaining to the girl (directly in front of me) that some customers are difficult and want you to microwave the bacon.  

4.  There is a sign on the counter saying if you order extra cheese or extra bacon you get a free cookie.  I ordered both of those extra and I didn't get my damn cookie!

5.  The girl that is being trained put my toppings on and apparently put too much spinach because the dude training her said no, that's too much and proceeded to take a bunch of spinach that was sitting on top of my bacon off my sandwich and back into the spinach bin.  Dude!  Vegetarians are gonna be pissed and that's gross!

6.  Dude rings me up and charges me for a BMT, which is extra.  I mention it to him (especially when my total is over $13) and he said no, he charged me right.  I get my receipt and point out that he did charge me wrong.  He rolls his eyes let's out a huge sigh and calls the manager over and says I want a dollar.  

7.  Manager stares at the register for a minute then proceeds to ask very rudely if she can just give me a cookie to call it even.  I told her no, I want my money and that I was already supposed to get a cookie which I didn't.  She then tells me they can't issue refunds so she can't help.  Uhhhh... hello?!?!   You overcharged me!  I'm not asking for a refund for a crappy sandwich, I want my damn money.  She said fine and handed me a dollar.  I told her I was overcharged more than just a dollar since it was rang up $3 for extra meat, not $1.50 for the extra bacon I really ordered.  She said no.  I was so annoyed that I almost threw my sandwich at her head but that would be rude and I was hungry so I walked out - not worth it at that point.  

So let's recap... I paid $13 for a really poorly made sandwich and a bag of chips that normally costs me $9.  I didn't get my damn cookie and the people are super rude!!  Oh yeah, they cross contaminate veggies with bacon."}
{"text":"Disgusting and filthy. Tuna in the  container was covered in a dark brown crust. The server quickly removed it after I changed my order. Tables not cleaned and sticky pop around the beverage area. Definitely won't risk my health here again."}
{"text":"Decided to get sandwiches for the Golden Knights game instead of KFC & boy that was a mistake....  They were out of peppercinis, provolone cheese, vinegar and they no longer offer spicy mustard (only in packets) ... and on top of that the female had a real shitty attitude.."}
{"text":"This is the best run Subway in Phoenix.  I eat subway daily and travel all over the valley and the operation here is consistently perfect.  Very well kept, food fresh, people are friendly and they actually seem to like working for the owners.

The only complaint I have is I wish they had the Fuze Sweet or Southern Sweet tea.  I tend to go out of my way to subways that have that on tap."}
{"text":"Lunch with my son after school....Had the carved Turkey sandwich which is tasty....crew is friendly, but need a little more energy."}
{"text":"Door locked during open business hours. Always something wrong with this location, will not be eating here anymore."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast sandwich & chocolate milk & got food poisoning  I've never had an issue with any other subway before. Definitely will be avoiding this one."}
{"text":"This subway is horrible. The food is old and when I went in the morning for breakfast, the lady was rude and didn't want to listen to what I wanted. I asked for coffee and she told me to go to mcdonalds next door, it's cheaper. I told her I don't want to go to mcdonalds I want subway coffee and she stared at me like I had 2 heads. 

There are enough subways around I don't ever need to go to this one again."}
{"text":"Busy location on the Strip-  with McDonald's, Panda Express, and small convenience mart (strip mall across from Mandalay Bay casino). If you are in a rush, especially during lunch time, you should call the order in and pick it up. Parking in front and back, for your convenience. Serves breakfast and salads besides sandwiches, sides, & drinks. Also does catering- sandwich platters (serves 5-9) and giant subs (3 ft./ 6 ft.).

(1) Choose type (footlong/ 6\" sandwich/salad/flatbread). (2) Choose type of bread (9 grain wheat/9 grain honey oat/italian/italian herb & cheese/flatbread). (3) Choose your cheese (american/monterey cheddar). (4) Choose your veggies (lettuce/tomatoes/cucumbers/peppers/red onions/pickles/olives/banana peppers/jalapenos. (my favorite part) (5) Choose your sauce (fat free- mustard/honey mustard/sweet onion/red wine vinegar/mustard- full flavor- light mayo/chipotle southwest/ranch/mayo/oil. (6) Make it a meal- choose your drink and side.

When you walk in, you smell the fresh baked bread- my husband loves that smell. I usually get the ham or the turkey footlong and sometimes the ham and turkey combo on wheat, with white cheese, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, jalapenos, banana peppers, olives- I love that there are so many veggie options (that's what edges out portasubs). And healthier options as well- sandwiches and dressing. Plus, this popular sandwich chain is the originator of the \"5 Dollar Footlongs.\" Sometimes there is baked lays potato chips. If you get the oil on your sandwich, it makes it soggy and eating a soggy sandwich is pretty messy (the sandwich just sticks to the roof of your mouth- yuck, hate that) and gross- drippy, gets all over your fingers. I like to eat half and save half for another meal (my normal routine). 

This one is close to work and is pretty busy at lunch time, so I recommend calling in your order if you're in the area. Once I ordered about ten sandwiches for a big meeting here and the large order (under $100) was ready for me to pick up, complete with condiments and napkins- really good service. Glad that I called it in, because the line was pretty long- about 8 people. And some of the seats were occupied so I'm sure that it would've been a packed house if the people in line were also eating there."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from Subway. Prepackaged food made without a smile. What drives me nuts is the lack of caring about finishing your food. I was first and only person in line. But then more people come in. Instead of finishing my sandwich and serving it hot they start building the people behind me. So mine sits and sits and sits. Don't bother telling the owner. He don't care. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First Subway that I've been to that shares it's space with a Winchell's.

If you're dining in, they serve your sandwich in a basket... Different.

Nice place for a late night snack."}
{"text":"This place supposedly is open until 9pm but I went to this particular subway at 7:30pm and they did not have any things ready such as vegetables for the sandwich. I did however ordered a sandwich and when it was time to pay the clerk working wouldn't take my coupon so I just left disgusted with this particular subway restaurant. I've never had this issue happen at any Subway I've ever been too."}
{"text":"Close to work.  Clean.  Not overly friendly.  They take coupons."}
{"text":"Have Donna curry contact me. Adriana barrios isn't true on my receipt at all! Your ph number isn't yours either! You have 702-704-3534 on my receipt but a non English guy answers the ph and doesn't know OUR language in the Usa! Vannessa did my bread when asked it to be toasted! She didn't even put the toppings on! Then she got mad and left kostas to do my order! I witnessed employee theft! UN ACCEPTABLE"}
{"text":"This subway is quick and convenient! I have never had to wait a long time, they usually have about 4 sandwich artist working during lunch time (only time I have gone). I like to stop by here to pick up a quick lunch and be on my way. I hate that you have to park on an incline , but even though the lot is small I have always found a space. It's a good alternative if you need a quick lunch and don't feel like dealing with the horribly designed metropolitan across the street (like seriously who designed that parking lot)!"}
{"text":"I just experienced for the first time in my life that someone who works at subway would call customers names while he is charging them for sandwich. This fat ugly kid at this location should work with pigs wearing overalls not serving food to people!! And I felt sorry for the people in the drive through too!! F... this place"}
{"text":"Came in to order but got this rude individual. Unfortunately, I also went to use the restroom to find out they were closed or out of order or something to that matter. I am surprised the health department allows a place like this to exist. 

I never speak bad but what a miserable place to order food at or even do business. Please manage t teach your people to be more courteous also fix your plumbing it's rather annoying that a person is unable to wash their hand before eating. It's rather bothersome as well I wonder if the employees wash their hands as well."}
{"text":"Unless you like mouldy vegetables, I don't suggest you eat at this place. I bought a 6-inch sub from this store and thought it tasted funny, so ater eating half the sandwich, I opened it up to discover that the 2nd tomato slice had mould on it. I had already eaten 1 of the slices which was probably what gave it the bad taste. This is absolutely unacceptable. 

A photo has been taken and submitted to Toronto Public Health. Hopefully this place gets what's coming to them."}
{"text":"Be careful using the drive through.  It took a long time because they served every single walk in customer before getting to mine. Every part of my order was wrong. Wrong sandwich, wrong drink, wrong side. Then they gave me attitude when I asked them to fix it. I usually like this place but not today."}
{"text":"Alex gave the best service  ever 
so much Courtesy 
so much kindness 
He was so just efficient and fresh
All 5 of My sandwiches were perfect
Thank goodness I found him  and the closest subway to my home"}
{"text":"Super expensive but somehow there was no option in Circus Circus for veggie eating folks. 
The staff is rude. I asked them to change their gloves because they had just served meat and they literally started throwing stuff inside the sandwich. Although we were the only ones in the restaurant that time, they started hurrying as if it is crowded. Service is very poor.
The dining area was not clean."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Subway I've ever visited. Not sure if the other reviewer works at this location or not but service here is consistently sub standard.

I've visited this location 3 times as it's closest to my house and not only is the service bad, but the portions of meat, cheese, and toppings are always skimpy, or you need to beg and barter for normal portions.

They honestly weighed the portion of cheese once to argue that they provided the accurate amount. Of course it came back light but what happened to the customer being right? We're talking about 10 cents worth of cheese?

Do yourselves a favor and drive the extra half mile to the next closest Subway. Or, visit the chinese food place next door as it actually has great service and food"}
{"text":"Great staff members. Always helpful in introducing customers to new promotions. More importantly they are patient to all customers, especially on PVCC students that take a long time to order."}
{"text":"Usually subway is pretty basic and clean as was this one. My problem was the blonde girl behind the counter slamming everything around because she had to \"stay ten minutes past her shift\"...

Welcome to America where Jobs are tough and you may have to go above and beyond even if it sucks.

So super slammer pulled my bread out slammed the glass, then when I asked for toasted the toaster door was slammed followed by a loud sigh. I'm pretty sure some black olives were harmed in the making of my sandwich. :(

Guy was very professional and laughing at the tissy fit, but kinda ruined it by awkwardly staring at me while waiting for the credit card machine to go through. 

I am a fan of good regular service, not aggressive lettuce tossing."}
{"text":"This subway is the best one in my immediate area. They have a knowledgeable staff and get your order right without any flack. The store is clean and well kept, and the service is quite friendly. 

Great quick meal and in my opinion a healthier option then pizza or burger king nearby."}
{"text":"State if the art facility! And the employees are extra friendly. It can't be easy working at subway, but the staff here are always very pleasant and overly friendly."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome veggie sub. Stuffed with fresh veggies and wrapped with care. Always great service at this location. My favorite Subway. Period."}
{"text":"Everyone at this location is super nice and friendly and the sandwiches and soup taste awesome. Going here has become a regular part of my day."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here. I had a preorder for only 10 sandwiches to be paid for with a corporate credit card and they would not make the food until it was paid. I have dealt with other subway stores with much larger orders and was not treated like I was a thief. There are plenty of subway stores in the area and I will take our corporate account elsewhere."}
{"text":"I Came here on Saturday Afternoon, the quality and premises are Great and hygiene..!!  If i compare my experience with other Subway locations near to it, this Will be best. Staff is friendly and when THEY HEAR A WORD MORE FROM A CUSTOMER THEY PUT REALLY MORE..!!

Happy Customer...!!!"}

The ham was the only edible meat. The salami was hard the lettuce and veggies was half frozen it was terrible. Hopefully it was just a bad morning:/"}
{"text":"I ate there because it's just a short walk from the Best Western Hotel where I stayed at for 2days.  It's very similar to the Subways I eaten at across the USA.  The only difference I saw that it has a Canadian Lobster Sub."}
{"text":"You have the rudest, impatient male employee in your store.( late teens or early 20's) I will not be back. When your employee was so impatient and rude to me, laughing, your other two lady employees didn't even acknowledge he was a jerk to a customer. I will spread the word to my friends not to go to this Subway. Worst service ever.

May 14, 2015 around 11:30 am."}
{"text":"The footlongs look shorter than normal and they only put 4 pieces of turkey on the whole footlong. Then the girl actually tired to put only two slices of pickes! By the time she was done none of the veggies even spaned across the bread even after I asked for extra veggies.

It was the saddest, thinest, most anorexic looking footlong I have ever seen... Not to mention that the sandwich had a strange salty/sour taste even though I ordered it exactly as I always do.

Worst subway ever."}
{"text":"Cheery guys working tonight.  All were courteous and helpful.  One wanted us to come back in a half hour to give us a coupon cuz he thought we were dissatisfied with service because register wasn't printing receipts and all I was wanting was an address so I could add them to Yelp.  ;-)
Unfortunately I was unable to make it back there cuz I had to take hubby some gas for his vehicle.

Oh, what I didn't like was the extremely loud, high pitched, door bell that sounds every time the door is opened.  Yeesh that was annoying.
Turn it down boys."}
{"text":"Relatively clean location.
Staff is prompt and efficient ftmp.  Menu items are relatively good and reasonably priced.
What I don't like it they keep changing the menu layout.  It's not like they add multiple new items, they just keep moving things around and creativing new categories.  Seems they have a $8.00 sub -did you know that?!

Overall the place is convenient, both in location and menu items, and often times a last minute option when we can't decide on dinner."}
{"text":"So convenient to grab something to eat here since it is inside of the WalMart.  Service is typically good and staff is polite.  Sandwiches are already a bargain so it's a win win all the way."}
{"text":"Ohhh lady, I didnt order my honey oat as a flat bread! But thats what I got!

Small Subway, hella ghetto workers, but what can you do? My son and I love spinach and turkey subs so this is where we went after LVAC. We were starving and of course they had their 5$ footlongs. The place is in a funky location right across from Starbucks. The parking hella sucks, but they do have a drive through and spinach! We went in around 8ish and there was like 4 pieces of bread left.... the one I got was flat and limp.... kinda like others things Ive had : (

The girls working were like cholas and looked high, whatever just give me a yummy sandwich! I had a simple one, she made it, and we left. The place was clean and they used gloves.

Ill def come back for a turkey with spinach on normal bread this time!"}
{"text":"Wellll when I need lunch and I dont wanna venture far I go to this hidden gem! Its more of a \"industry workers\" Subway bc its hidden and not too many ppl know about it! 

The customer service is superb, and they are very quick during the lunch time rush! Here you can actually ask questions and get an honest answer about a sandwich. The prices are the same as other places and they are not  greedy with the spinach as others are! I normally get the buffalo chicken on multi grain with swiss and hella spinach and a little bit on ranch, many do not know but I am OBSESSED with anything buffalo chicken! Its like my thing! Here the grilled chicken is smothered in hot sauce and is succulent and tender! They toast my lunch up, and its not too toasty, which is awesome! Top that bad boy off with spinach and a sprinkle of ranch, and BAM... MONEY!

I will continue coming here bc the ppl are nice, its clean, and quick!"}
{"text":"I came in this morning and this man worker came up and didn't say hello. He grabbed on his phone to check unimportant things then he asked me what bread I would want I told him I want Italian, but it ran out!? It's 9am! I want the bread to enjoy my meal with. Then I picked different bread, then I asked for ham he didn't put the ham in a right way and it was very sloppy! I would never come back again, no manners and did not receive what I wanted for my lunch. :("}
{"text":"24 hour subway! What else is there to know? If it's 3 am and you want subway instead of McDonald's, this is your spot. Food and service on par with other locations in the chain."}
{"text":"Lunch time wasnt busy at all, with only 2 people seated eating plus myself I was expecting a full house. So I'm ready to order my meal. I asked for toasted lightly just to melt the cheese. My bread was over toasted, top and bottom bread was like croutons in some places. Then i asked for light mustard she ends up putting heavy mayo instead. I should have asked for a new sandwhich but i hate to see this waste into the trash. So i dine in and notice i wasnt given any napkins with my order, no biggie I'll just ask for some.  then i realize everyone else asking for napkins. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"The food taste great and service is good. Same good quality I would expect from Subway. Staff are nice and pleasant to speak to. Not like some locations where they don't say anything except \"what else, what else....\"

The locked bathrooms are a bit annoying but I'm guessing that's for a reason. 

Overall, a good place to eat when you're on the run!"}
{"text":"OK, it's Subway so you get the general idea of the place.

I am a fan of this particular location for a couple of reasons:

1.  Parking - there is lots of it as it's next to a Bashas supermarket

2. Lunch Prep - they always have around 5 sandwich artists at this location at lunch.  They draw a brisk lunch crowd but move through it quickly


3, Ingredients - Their sandwich toppings are always fresh - never looked like they had sat out too long like some other places.

That's it!"}
{"text":"typical size store.  

surprised they even open that late, til 4am on some weeknites.

wifi good."}
{"text":"It's like someone shook all the subway's in the world and all the good employees held on while the others were whisked away to this store. Incompetence doesn't even begin to describe it. I'll go out of my way for subway next time. Bunch of morons."}
{"text":"Idiots pure idiots. Can't even cut and wrap a sandwich properly! Wish they let us give them negative stars!

Stay away there's a better one right down the road."}
{"text":"I walked in earlier this week at 7an in the morning, no one in the place, and they wouldn't toast only 1/2 of my foot long sandwich, although it was only tuna, nothing else on the sandwich. I contacted subway corporate and they had the store manager reach out to me. The store manager gave me a 1 min story about employee theft and I just zoned out after that point cause this guy has no idea the customer comes first, before his internal challenges. Fix the prob internally without affecting customer service. Huh. Not going back to this subway store, especially when 2 other subways I frequent honor my request."}
{"text":"We ordered three platters for thirty people. There was plenty for all. Alex the manager was friendly, accomodating and efficient.  The sandwiches received good cooments, some took home the extra.  We really enjoyed the steak sandwiches.  Alex had the platters ready at our specified time and they looked great.  The condiments were plentiful too.  And he took great care to make sure the steak sandwiches weren't soggy."}
{"text":"Got food delivery from here, ordered a BLT and added cheese and red onions. My sandwich came with bacon red onions and cheese. Called to ask what happened and she said you have to select each ingredient you want....even though I ordered a menu item. Thing is, I didn't select bacon....I guess they figured I wanted a bacon sandwich. Nice place"}
{"text":"Worst subway ever.  Peak hours and have one staff member who by the way while making 4 sandwiches at the same time and having a customer waiting for more then 15 mins asks to use the restroom and can't because \"sorry sir I have to unlock it for you\". Dirty and just bad service.  Go to another subway."}
{"text":"the staff is insanely nice, served me very well even when I was intoxicated and make very good sandwiches, they gut peppers for you and if the paper sticks to the sub they feel bad and change the paper overall amazing service IGN 10/10"}
{"text":"Horrible service , rude unprofessional the sandwich was just ok. One door was locked without any sign or anything (most of the customers tried the first door for no reason !), went to order the  2 ladies behind the counter completely ignored me after o asked cpl of times I asked for the $25 subway card for the Free 6\" sub she makes me the tuna that I asked them she passed me to the other lady which she charged my card the amount of the sandwich not the card that I asked in the first place ! When I asked why she said you didn't tell me you said it to the other lady !when I asked to correct the mistake to charge me $25 for the card she was rude she said now she did the transaction cannot do it !! Worst subway experience ever !"}
{"text":"Usually I really enjoy subway, but my last visit wasn't ideal. My preferred sandwich is a veggie and cheese with extra cheese and add avocado. The young man working there the other evening grabbed the package of avocado and there visibly wasn't enough for 2 scoops, probably not enough for one scoop, so he took the spreader and got what he could from the edges and put it on my sandwhich which resulted in a very thin layer with several inches uncovered. I should have said something but didn't as the charge for avocado on a footlong is $1.50. This sandwhich was just under $9 and had little flavor as I don't add sauces or oil/vinegar since the avocado usually add the creaminess, flavor and moisture to the bread. I think I'm done with this subway."}
{"text":"I'd rather deal with sitting on a cactus vs dealing with the staff at this location.  Maybe it's meth or maybe mommy and daddy forced them to get a job, either way they need to learn some basic communication skills and customer service skills.  I'd rather prisoners make my sandwich"}
{"text":"Best customer service! Amber is really great. I come in every morning and sit/sip/eat before work. I always try to buy a little something. I work just a few steps away from here and have to wait until we open. My husband drops me off early because he works on the other side of town. Amber is so kind about letting me in right around when they open. She doesn't have to be this kind, but she is! She deserves recognition!"}
{"text":"Standard subway here, it's really a hit or miss operation  depending on who your sandwich artist is. I've had one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten here and one of the worst hence the 3 stars. If you stay on top of the sandwich making operation it should go well. If you tell them and go to the bathroom you deserve what you get."}
{"text":"Overall: 4 stars.  Usual Subway but gets an extra star for a big and roomy interior.

Food: 3 stars.  Usual Subway selection.  Good variety.

Prices: 3 stars.  Regular 6-inch prices are not cheap, but the foot long and specials are good.

Service: 3 stars.  Average service.

Interior: 4 stars.  Big and roomy, and usually not very busy."}
{"text":"Came in here like 20 minutes prior to closing n the employee a young gurl was rude n not to helpful. Which i understand u wanna close already n go home, but unfortunately ifs atill an open business so u have to serve the customer. Well our subs were horrible ahe didn't gibe us a choice o bread n one aas to hard on the ends ahe didn't make them to our liking. She had an attitude n rolled her eyes when we requested certain things in the subb. This young lady needs to be retrained. Id put her name on here but im not gonna do that cuz ive already spoke to Maria which was a manager ahe was very accommodating n replaced my meal wit no problem n i explained to her the situation n ahe said she would have to go bak to retrain. No is she retraining idk.. But i got my complaint out n new food. Thx Maria"}
{"text":"How high was the curly haired blonde kid today?  I walked in and he was staring off into space. I said hello and he barely acknowledged my presence.  Then a female cut in front of him to help me.  I asked for a footlong on honey oat, and he said \"You're a honey oat\", then chuckled to himself. If she hadn't gotten in front of him to help me, this 2x a week guy wouldn't come back. Then he started making himself a sandwich and began talking to it.  I never YELP, but I think owners and Managers should know whats going on in their stores."}
{"text":"Seems like there is a different person who works here everyday. By chance the last two times I've visited here I got the same girl. Last time she (the tall blonde) made my husband and I's sandwiches she didn't even cut the sandwiches in half. This time she didn't give me proper change back for my transaction. She's less than friendly and seems put out working here. The sandwiches are good but lacking in customer service. Two stars is for the sandwich alone."}
{"text":"The new fat worker at this establishment forgot to cut my fucking sandwich in half like most subways in my area do, he also laced my sandwich with his own semen. Like who the hell does that. Also the new worker put 10 pounds of fucking salt all over my sandwich, my tongue literally has no taste buds left, the salt killed them all. So anyway 5 stars out of 5, quality service here."}
{"text":"So one afternoon, stopped by to eat a chicken teriyaki sandwich. Looked pretty good.

I have this weird thing of chopping my subs into one bite sizes, so was doing that as usual.
after I have half of my sub, I find a piece of chiken..... pink inside.

They served me a half raw chicken sub!

I mean, I noticed this cause of my weird hobby of chopping my sandwich but if I didn't, I probably wouldn't of noticed. . .  don't wanna think about that.

I went to show them that and, they remade me a new chicken teriyaki sub (which was nice) but. . .  I totally lost my appitite and was scared of imagening finding another half raw chicken in my sandwich.

There's other subway's in town so probably go to those, never back to this one."}
{"text":"I've gone to this Subway now about half a dozen times if not more and it just isn't very good overall. The food is Subway food so no real need to get into that. You know what you are getting heading there. The real issue is the service/employees. Now I get it, this isn't Your forever job and you are hoping for more but for now, this is Your stepping stone. Take a little responsibility for how you conduct yourself and represent the business you work for. More often than not, employees are not available or attentive. You almost have to track one down unless it is lunch hour.  So one example of the just cruddy experience was having a steak wrap made. The girl put everything on the wrap veggie-wise and says, \"Is that it?\" I said yes, except for the steak.  She replied \"Well yeah, I know that.\"  I explained to her it just seemed strange because all the other times the meat went on first. She literally said to me, \"Well this is the right way. Who works here, you or me?\"  Then says, just so you know you may as well get a fork because when I wrap this it will fall apart...(ps. It did). I asked her if she could just use two wraps and that I always get these and no one else has had problems with them falling apart. She just said \"No\".  There was a lunch line so I just dealt with a really terribly made wrap!  Not ideal!  Then today it took 15 minutes for a Veggie Salad.  The girl kept complaining about how hard it is to chop the salads and put double cheese on it that I didn't ask for. While she was making it the other girl rang me out and I paid. Once the salad was made, the girl making it tried to ring me out again. When I said I had already paid she said where is your receipt. I pointed to the printer because I was never given the receipt so she grabbed it and said \"Okay whatever\".  Never did get my receipt either.  Again, it's the attitude and service I'm knocking here. It's just uncalled for and everyone who works in this area complains about it. I actually work with one guy who refuses to go to this Subway and walks downtown if he wants it. I may be joining him!"}
{"text":"It is Subway. What else do you need to know? Just like the 1000 other locations it is clean and staff provides you what you ask for on your sandwich. 

I go here at least twice a month. The food is fresh and we have never seen this location dirty or different than other locations around the country. ."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a shout out to the 3 fabulous workers that helped me the other day- Celeste, Yuli and Jesus are awesome!  (But minus a star because I tried to call my huge order in and the number was a fax number and I could not find a store number to save my life.)   I was hosting a large community event up the street were my company was supposed to provide sandwiches...  (because the phone # was wrong) I walked in at 6:30 on a Wednesday and ordered 45 subs and needed them asap.  The 3 people working only looked horrified for a split second and then they were on it!  They managed to wait on incoming customers and make my gigantic order simultaneously in great time.  They probably could have used a 'lil help from a manager.... if there was one they never made an appearance..... but the 3 that were up front deserve a huge thank you for their customer service. :)"}
{"text":"Awful!!!!! It took us half an hour to get through the line and there was a total of 3 people in front of us. They are very unfriendly and actually quite rude. The store was a disaster. There were no chips or cookies. I thought it was cool to have a subway close by but every time I've been there it's been a bad experience."}
{"text":"Was in the area picking up a machine. Looked liked a convenient place to eat lunch. Boy was I wrong. Should of read the reviews first. Most of my evening was on the toilet. Eat at your own risk! Also the blonde girl was very rude to my friend and I. Had some questions about the menu and she was bothered answering us. The ham sandwich was more like a lettuce sandwich. Sliced so thin"}
{"text":"Great service but I just cant help but lose my appetite when a homeless transient is next to me. The smell just makes me lose my appetite. I understand they have a right to be there, but surely there is a policy regarding smelling up the place. 
The server was very polite and took my order promptly. The food was OK. By the time I ate it was all soggy."}
{"text":"How do I contact owner? 2nd time I stopped in and they were out of Tuna and meatballs!!!!! Not to mention it was only 7:45. Seems to me you have a bunch of lazy employees or a Manager that needs TRAINING!!!! I going to purposely keep going there to see how many times this happens!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Wednesday night at 8:30. Staff already had chairs propped upside down on the tables like they were closed (suppose to be open till 10) I went to order 2 six inch on white, 1 tuna and 1 turkey and they tell me they are out of Tuna, Turkey and white bread! (REALLY??) How does this happen at Subway? That's like McDonalds running out of burgers and fries! Staff member tells me they will have everything in the morning. Sounds to me like they just were done working for the night. WOW...disappointing Subway!"}
{"text":"It's subway. I'm not really sure what else to say. But it's near my office and when I forget lunch, and don't want anything the cafeteria has to offer and I'm on a limited time budget this place wins every time. 

Only downfall is that if you go directly at noon, you're gonna be in line for awhile, due to the office folk. Go a little early or a little late and you'll be good to go."}
{"text":"Just picked up my sandwich the bread was very substandard no pun intended very surprised always enjoyed it before don't know if they are cutting back but it was really poor quality!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for work so I thought I'd give this location another shot. Came to this subway during lunch and it's such a long wait!!! The entire staff doesn't  know what they're doing. I'm not sure if they're all new or not but it's ridiculous especially during the lunch hour. Management needs to do some serious training. People don't have much time to wait especially during lunch break."}
{"text":"this subway has the freshest bread!
amazing staff with unique personalities. 
always a pleasure chatting while they prepare my sandwich!"}
{"text":"drove completely out of the way because I was craving subway & this one is supposedly 24 hours.... it's not. they were closed at 11:30!"}
{"text":"These employees aren't trained. GET IT TOGETHER SUBWAY... This was the worst experience I've ever had at any location."}
{"text":"Open til 2am and they totally don't hold back with the goods. They were nice even tho it was past 1am which is awesome on their part since most people up this late aren't always in the best of moods. But I'm pretty happy with what was served. It doesn't take much to keep this girl satisfied! Lol"}
{"text":"It's really hard to completely fuck up a chain restaurant.

I mean, come on.   You buy a franchise... they give you everything that you need.   The food supplies.  The ovens.  The cute little menus.  The Wallpaper.  The uniforms. The cookie cases.  

Somehow...even with all this hand-holding... these people still managed to make this location into the 'single worst subway location on the planet'.

When you walk in the door you immediately feel like you're on 'Candid Camera'.    There's no bread.   They're missing key vegetables.   The sandwich artists are high on their own paint fumes.  

This subway has derailed."}
{"text":"I went there with my kids and ordered 5 foot long subs combo with a drink and 1 cookies each and these tattooed Mexican B up sellers my kids to get bottles instead the foundation that I ordered too bad I can't give them ZERO stars that's what they deserve"}
{"text":"One of the few locations that take Dinex, Subway is a convenience for CMU students who are looking to spend some of their meal plan. However, during my visit, they claimed the card machine was broken and didn't accept Dinex. Disappointment.

Then for the service, the guy who served me was a mean guy. He was the type that you wouldn't want to mess with, which is what I guess is good for this Subway, but it was overall just really unwelcoming to me and I was afraid to ask for anything on my sub. Furthermore, he was not attentive in putting together my sub, which resulted in a potpourri disaster. Seriously, look at my photo. 

Surprisingly, the sub still tasted decent. I could taste all the flavors, and the roast beef was not dry. Props for an anticlimactic result from a prelude of bad omens."}
{"text":"The worst Subway I ever been to. If you have a choice I recommend you to dine at another Subway else where. In a world where customer service is valued this has been the worst experience thus far! The owner advised me, I didn't spend enough money to earn their customer service. 

Extremely Poor Customer Service."}
{"text":"This Subway doesn't even deserve 1 star. Since I only had a 30 minute lunch break at work I placed an online order and paid online expecting to be able to pick up the food and run in and out. When I arrived to pick up my order I was informed the order never went through. I questioned the employee why the charge was pending if the order never went through. He assured me just because it was pending it would not clear since it never went through on their system. So besides having to take another 20 minutes to re order food and pay a 2nd time which was beyond inconvenient, I was still double charged and both the amounts did in fact clear. I figured it would be an easy fix by calling to speak with the so called manager. The manager was so unbelievably unhelpful I was in shock. He offered me a free sandwich and said there was nothing he could do about the extra charge. WOW! A free sandwich for a $17 charge! He sounded like a child, who knows if that was really the manager to begin with. Either way I was told twice \"there's nothing I can do\". I don't even see how this store is up and running with customer service like this!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Rude staff that never smiles or greets their customers. They just stand around and look lost! Food does not look fresh. Dining area is now well kept. Today they looked at me like I was crazy because I needed my receipt. Not my problem your credit card machine was out of paper. Suggestion try being more organized. Also, try limiting the number of customers that smell like weed. I nearly left this afternoon from contact buzz. Never going back, I'd take my chances with the \"all you can eat\" pancakes at the biker bar down the street."}
{"text":"We have had a problem with our orders for the last 6 months. Tonight topped it off, we ordered a 12 inch tuna sandwich WITHOUT the tuna!!! I just called and the girl Sierra who made our food, lied and said she didn't make it and blamed the \"newbie\" about the mistake. She also claims to be the assistant manager? Place is so rubbish."}
{"text":"This subway is apparently \"private\" so they don't follow national promotions like the \"buy one get one free foot long if you buy a drink\" or accept any coupon that I bring from the mail or from a coupon book. You'll be better off going to the one on Forbes. literally every time I've gone here with a coupon I've had to pay full price."}
{"text":"You would think it would be hard to screw up a concept as simple as Subway but this one has managed to underwhelm me on two separate occasions.  The first time I figured it was just a fluke, but going again today and getting the same service confirms that this is just how this place operates.

I walk in today and there's a couple people sitting at tables but no one in line so I walk right up to the counter.  There's a girl behind the counter standing in the doorway to their back room and she kind of looks at me but doesn't say anything or walk over right away.  After a little bit she finally makes her way over to me, still doesn't say anything and starts putting plastic gloves on.  Then I think she might have mumbled something but I didn't hear her, she finally made eye contact with me though so I went ahead and told her what I wanted.  She seemed to be doing okay with actually making the sandwich until it came to the veggies (maybe she's got something against them?) because she practically pinched the lettuce and spinach to put on my sandwich.  No handful sized servings here apparently.

When it came time to pay a guy was at the register to take my order and he asked the typical questions about whether I wanted it to go or not, did I want to make it a meal, etc. and then he gets to my total and says it's $6 something.  It took me a second but I thought about it and I only got a 6-inch sandwich with nothing else, so I asked him \"How much did you say you're gonna charge me?\"  To which he laughs and says, \"Oh, you caught it!  Haha, April Fools!\"  Ummmm.....I'm sorry but I'm not laughing."}
{"text":"Pretty sure that the guy named Dario that made my sandwich was high or drunk. He gave me the wrong bread and kept asking me over and over what I wanted on it. The girl working named Bailey was a total bitch to a customer when she tore up his sandwich. Plus they were arguing in front of customers.  Worst subway experience I've ever had.  Update: when we got back, we realized our sandwiches weren't cut in half and they didn't give us any napkins. Seriously the worst subway I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I don't expect to much from a 24 hour Subway, but Eliana is hands down the rudest sandwich artist ever. Avoid this location if after 10pm"}
{"text":"Subway is alway a good fast food choice. I normally just go with their monthly $5 special.  This location is well kept with fast friendly staff."}
{"text":"Looks clean but poor customer service stingy on the toppings has ask him twice for more olives lady rush that fake have good response  won't be back February 15th 1:20pm"}
{"text":"Just to slow...getting a sub here is like pulling teeth sometimes. Under staffed is the main problem. If more then 1 person comes in at a time your looking at a good 15 -20 min wait. Way to long to wait just for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, and consistently delicious...definitely a regular stop for students in the area."}
{"text":"Been a while since i came by so this morning I decided to have subway for lunch on my way to work. It was 615am and the door was locked. I decided to shake on it while I saw a guy in the back working, hoping to get his attention. I called their number and ask if they were open and Alex? Said NO. 

Umm there is a  OPEN 24hr sign but the place is closed at 615am. 

Darn, lost out on 2 customers as i had to let the guy walking towards the place know that they were closed."}
{"text":"This Subway USE to be 5 stars. I go here multiple times a week for YEARS. 

In the last few weeks something has changed. At first I thought it was a fluke. (waiting a full 5 minutes at least in an empty drive through before being helped for instance or ordering on line coming in 25 minutes after I put in the order, 5 min AFTER they say to pick up and wait a FULL 15 minutes to get my sandwich after I arrived etc....) 

I really like all the employees they are great and I do not blame them. I heard they have a new owner and was like OH that is what it up. So new owner, under staffing is going to make me go someplace else. I don't have 25 minutes to spend getting a sandwich. ESPECIALLY when I try really hard to avoid the rush (the drive through experience was almost 2pm). 

Use to be the best subway around. I hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Subway is by far my favorite place to get food. The service is always amazing. The staff is nice and helpful. The food is fast and easy to get with as many toppings as you want. Although there foot long sandwiches may be too big to eat at once, you can eat half and save the rest for later. There Italian bread whether it's toasted or not is amazing with fresh veggies and condiments of your choice. With the meal you can either get chips or cookies of both with a soft drink of any kind. Gets more delicious with each bite. High recommend."}
{"text":"The avocado is mashed,  it makes a great substitute for mayo!

this subway has excellent service, the staff is always friendly and helpful.  I had the Roast Beef on wheat, and when i at first asked for regular lettuce then changed my mind to spinach leaves, my sandwich pro scraped it off with a smile! I've never been a huge fan of subways bread, its soft and chewy, but lacks a hard outer crust.  The rest of the sandwich was good, and i will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Once again come into this location and worst customer service. Your employees are extremely unhappy and hate their jobs. They have no life in them can't even say a hello or ask what type of sandwich we want. Everytime I come in its a lifeless person that doesn't want to be there. I get it not everyone likes their jobs but for every employee to be like this at this location something is wrong."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best subways I've ever been to! 9 times out of 10, you go into subway, order a sandwich, and the employees either do a poor job of making the sandwich or they skimp on ingredients bc their bosses are cheap bastards! This Subway has a fun, laid back manager, and cheerful employees that make a BOMB sandwich every time, thus restoring my faith in Subway! They are true sandwich artists!"}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times in the past couple of months.  It's a go-to when I'm not sure what I want, and I work a few steps away downtown.  Usually I wouldn't bother reviewing a fast food restaurant, but this one is damn good.  As mentioned in another review, the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Great friendly customer service here. Got the cold cut 6\" for $4.99. There's only one table to sit at so expect to take your sandwich elsewhere to enjoy. Bread and ingredients aren't very fresh....but it's Subway, not some fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"They weren't busy, didn't even acknowledge my husband and I standing there. Not even a be with you in a moment. The one working the line walked out to his vehicle, other at the register washed his hands then went off to bullsh*t with whoever was in the back. We might as well of been ghosts, so we left. Wish I could give review with 0 stars, won't come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Miguel at this subway has to be the best employee I have ever seen at any subway ever!  also this is the cleanest I've ever been to.  and he made the best sandwich ever.  he is a nicest person and I will be back."}
{"text":"Neat & clean. Service was very good. Try new Mediterranean steak on wheat flat bread. Excellent!"}
{"text":"I've visited this Subway for lunch a few times. Nothing particularly special about it, but nothing to complain about either. Staff keeps the place clean and the ingredients look fresh enough every time I visit. Not my first choice for lunch but if I'm in a rush and need something quasi-healthy, this is the place."}
{"text":"First time at this location and was welcomed right away. The crew was fast and efficient. Thanks to Tishawn  and his coworker. Fast and great tasting food! Sunday is the best sub of the day!"}
{"text":"Great salads, very friendly service. And thier breakfast is better then other fast foods."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times before. This is a place where my son and I like to walk to for lunch. Unfortunately I don't know if they have switched owners but it has really gone down hill. 
I was craving the pastrami sandwich until I saw that the meat was grey very and dried out. My son got a stem or two on his tomatoes in the sandwich. The guy next to us asked for american cheese and she said no and put some white on. All the tables but one were dirty. 
Just all in all disappointing. Used to be a fan!"}
{"text":"Located in the El Cortez, the sandwiches come in handy in the whee early hours. Aside from the usual drunken patrons during after -drinking- hours, the service is as fast as one person could possibly make it. I don't go out of my way to eat here for lunch or dinner, but I do make a point to come here for my 4am freshly made sandwich. 

If you gamble enough at the El Cortez (1941 points), you can get a $6 credit at this subway."}
{"text":"Sometimes there is a line, sometimes there is not. But I always receive the same amount of good service and food at this Subway. The staff is friendly and they know how to make a sandwich. The breads are always fresh, as well as the meats, cheeses and veggies. What more can I say? Subway. Eat Fresh."}
{"text":"The pros: sandwich was predictably good, service was good. The cons: the bathroom was disgustingly dirty. I was in a rush and the guy was going pretty slow.  I'd say this place is okay. Not great, not horrible, just okay."}
{"text":"My family and I went here last night. Although the food was fine, the customer service was really lack luster. The newer employee had a lot of questions, but she always kept a smile on her face and tried her best, but the veteran employee she was paired with was rude to her customers and especially rude to the girl she was working with. We went in the store at 620p and did not leave until 650p which is the longest I have even stood in a subway line. 15 of those minutes was just waiting to be acknowledged and the rest was spent trying to get our food together. While we were getting our sandwiches made by the new girl the veteran would help the people behind us and skip over the girl constantly using the last of the topping such as the lettuce without replacing it. That would cause her to go to the back, get flustered, and forget our order. Every time the girl would ask the other worker a question, she would get snappy and talk down to her coworker. I worked in food service for 4 years, and I know how hard it is to work with the new person, but I also know that stuff like that makes new people quit, and also causes you to lose customers."}
{"text":"It is great having a Subway in our neighborhood. It is clean and everyone is friendly. Good healthy food!"}
{"text":"BLT with advocado is soo good. I use only mustard, cheese, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, olives, pickles, and bellpeppers. My favorite sandwich there."}
{"text":"So I took the weekly coupon in but they refused to honor it as they do not have a reader.  I was advised to print it out next time. Apparently there is no way around not having a reader."}
{"text":"On a busy Sunday morning, Shelby did such a good job during the lunch rush! She was by herself and I felt conflicted to hit up a different subway because it was busy and I like my sandwich toasted for two min.. if I had a tip, I would've given it to her. She remembered everyone's lists of add ons, even as she was juggling orders. Give this girl kudos"}
{"text":"After a round of golf, we decided to stop off for lunch. From a distance I could hear 'Welcome to Subway!', but it wasn't from the employee who took our order. He must have been in some far off planet because he didn't know the menu and what condiments he had in front of him. I ordered a number 4 and my friend ordered a number 5 with cheddar cheese. 
The employee had to look at the sign behind him to see what they were. He started putting pepper jack cheese on my friends order and when confronted with, 'What type of cheese are you putting on my sandwich?', he said that he didn't have cheddar cheese. So he was going to put any type of cheese on my his sandwich. His supervisor or manager pointed to a container that had the shredded cheddar cheese. 
Won't be back too soon."}
{"text":"Cold cut combo is cheap and good for you. Get the flat bread toasted. Always greeted with a smile and a hello."}
{"text":"Visited this location last night. The hubby and I were the only customers there. The guy working, Cesar, was so unbelievably rude. He got so annoyed that we decided to get some sandwiches. I asked for an Italian bmt. He informed me that they didn't have any salami. So I asked I if could add turkey to it, even if it was an extra charge, and he flat out told me no. I was annoyed and got a different sandwich. During which, he was so pushy about what I wanted on it. After he rushed through my husband sandwich, he went on break. Even though he could see some more customers walking up. This is just pure laziness and terrible customer service. Will not be back again."}
{"text":"Subway is an average at very best meal to start with.  Throw in staff that make it perfectly clear that you are inconveniencing them by ordering a turkey /ham sub.  You are left with a 1 star review, and a customer who will not return."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I walked in with the hopes of it being Chinese food but they asked me what toppings I wanted on my sub. Martha was chewing her gum ferociously as she put cheese on my \"sub\". I asked if they had chow mein and they replied \"This is subway.\" AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW. I give them a 3 because it was tasty but was really hoping for a dish of orange chicken and chow mein.
Update: Apparently if you are in Chinatown, the Subways there don't serve Chinese food. Good to know."}
{"text":"This place I've been to before and never have I had my sandwich made like my sandwich was made today. I asked for cheese and the response I got was \"it already has 4 layers of cheese\" he went about putting 5 spinach and limited all the veggies and meats were just all slapped on like no care.. this all in front of me and me trying to tell him to put more stuff was intimidating because he would respond with his attitude all over his face becauSe I request extras on my sandwich it's not like I wouldn't pay for it.. ! Very disappointed in the service and the poorly prepared sandwich !!"}
{"text":"I give it a one star because when I went in there at 5:30 am and asked for a breakfast sandwich, Carlos, the man behind the counter told me because the microwave was clean. I then said, \"so you're telling me you won't make my sandwich because you don't want to re-clean the microwave?\" He said yes. And this is not the first time he has said this to me. He said it a few weeks ago and I just let it go but to blatantly not make someone's food (which is his job) because he doesn't want to clean it after is an outrage!! Not very good customer service in my opinion!!"}
{"text":"Total satisfied with this location. Some of the raspberry cookies could be cooked a little bit less in the oven, but hey, for a subway and a sandwich and what I was expecting, this place certainly deserves 5 stars. Staff has always been good, soda has always been available, and food has always been just dandy. I always get a roast beef flatbread sandwich. This is always my go to for a healthier option before driving a long ways."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours which is great for me since I'm a nightowl :) and each time I have gone the people have been very nice and fast!"}
{"text":"A clean location with plenty of parking in front of the shop. I stopped in to grab a sandwich on my way back to work after a doctor appointment. It was near the lunch rush, but wasn't busy at all. The woman working quickly greeted me, prepared my sandwich, and cashed me out. She wasn't overly friendly, but she was quick. My sandwich was consistent with the brand."}
{"text":"This was my go to location when I first moved to town and lived within walking distance, but it had been awhile until my visit this week. I was rushing between a doctor appointment and a dentist appointment so this fit the bill for quick, light dinner. 

This location can get busy during lunch and dinner times, but the line has never been too long. The food and menu options have always been consistent with other Subway locations. The service here has never been awesome, but it isn't bad either. The staff seems indifferent most of the time. The inside of the restaurant has always been clean.

I like all of the promotions that Subway has been offering like the $3 sandwich of the day and bonus gift cards or a free sandwich with purchase of a gift card."}
{"text":"This is your standard subway. It is always clean and well stocked. The best part is the location. It is easily accessible from Silverado Ranch. I eat here almost daily. Take advantage of the iPhone app or the gift card discount. You can save money."}
{"text":"Your basic subway, except it is open 24 hours and off the beaten path. You see a lot of industry in here. I work at the law firm around the corner. Subway is always good for healthy options and I have lost some weight by incorporating subway sandwiches into my diet.

Sometimes it is also nice to be able to get a healthy sandwich in the middle of the night rather than hitting up the Taco Bell drive thru."}
{"text":"There are two Subways in Anthem.  Everybody told me the other one was better.  I went anyway and wow, what a shock.  After the first person put on 4 turkey slices and then 4 ham slices on the next person took 2 slices off of each one and told the first not to put on so much meat.  Sandwiches of the day don't get as much meat.  She did that right in front of me.  Not a very good value for the money.  

The next day I went to the other Subway and they built a better sandwich."}
{"text":"I never have an issue with this location. I never had any complaints or attitude from the workers.

I am always happy to come here & I usually order multiple sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went in was helped immediately, and JeSus was the best!! Very friendly, he was helpful and actually cared about his customers, had a pleasant conversation with each one of them.. Very efficient and fast paced also."}
{"text":"When the gas station this Subway is inside explodes, assume it's due to the \"sandwich artists\" smoking their cigarettes right next to the propane tanks. They probably don't wash their hands either, so I hope you like nicotine in your  below subpar sandwich..."}
{"text":"A relatively busy location but this is a good thing in my opinion- the busier the store the fresher the ingredients as they are constantly having to refresh the veggies, bake new batches of bread, etc. This location fits that bill very well. In fact the last several times I've visited, the bread is super fresh (ordered a couple types over those trips too)- and the toppings are fresh and crispy too!

The toasted buffalo chicken on parmesan oregano bread is excellent- make sure to add more buffalo sauce when building your sandwich. Load it up with your favorite toppings like lettuce, cheese, ranch dressing, black pepper, and. jalepenos. 

This location stresses a rule for their customers to put down the mobile phones while ordering (not waiting in line but actually ordering the sandwich) and I commend them for this. Too many times people impede the process simply because they are chatting or taking orders for someone else's sandwich, lame!"}
{"text":"I walked in to subway, wasn't greeted. When I went to the window to order a salad they acted as if it was a tragedy. He muttered, \" last thing I want to do\" to the other employee and angrily went to get the salad bowl. I go to subway quit often so I am familiar with the questions they ask. I asked for a chicken salad. He grabbed the chicken & started to throw it in the bowl with out asking me if I wanted it heated up. The only reason he heated it up was because he realized it was frozen. When it was time to chop the veggies up he chopped the lettuce too. Why would I want shredded lettuce to be chopped? To top it off, he left with my salad and came back with Saran Wrap as a lid. I had to ask for dressing because obviously it was inconvenience to put some on my salad to begin with. I would rather drive 35min to my regular subway then drive 30seconds to this place."}
{"text":"This place is so mismanaged.  I have been here three times and every time they have been out of the meatballs in addition to their soups.  Their cup lid organizer is always empty and I always have to ask for a lid or go without a lid which is annoying to me either way.  The tables are usually dirty even though the place is slow and empty.  A few months ago, I ordered an Italian sub here and the guy asked me what kind of meat I wanted on it?  Huh?  Its supposed to come with whatever meat the Italian sub comes with.  The guy informed that I could put whatever meat I wanted on the sandwich.  So I asked him if I wanted to have tuna fish instead I could get it?  He said yes.  Then I tried to explain to him that it would no longer be an Italian sub, it would be a tuna sub.  He seemed to not understand my point.  He said it would still be an Italian sub, but with tuna fish instead.  I proceeded to tell him that the thing that makes an Italian sub is predominantly the meats and he agreed, but then followed up by asking me what kind of meats I wanted on my Italian sub.  Doh!  At the time, I couldn't remember the names of the Italian meats, so I asked him what meats typically come on the Italian and he said whatever meats I wanted?  Double Doh!  As he made my sandwich he ran out of meat and cheese leaving about 2-3 inches of my sub empty.  He quickly closed the sandwich hoping I wouldn't see that the back half of my sub contained nothing but bread.  When I mentioned it, he played dumb and asked me if I wanted him to fix it.  Yes, of course I do.  I am paying for it.

Last week I stopped by this place again in starving desperation and was relieved to find another guy working the counter.  Whew!  I told him that I wanted an Italian sub and he said no problem, what kind of meat do you want on it?  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!  He proceeded to make the sandwich with gaps in between the meats to make the least amount of meat possible spread across the length of the sandwich.  Their were portions of my sub where my bite contained absolutely no meat.

The reality is that subway is not a good place to eat.  They use low quality meats, cheeses, and ingredients, prepared by low quality people who can care less about your satisfaction.

I won't be spending my money here any more."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Subway, but for this one I'll make an exception.  First visit was adequate service and average sub.  This morning was surly service and a not great sub as a bonus she put the wrong sauce on to go with stingy toppings.  There's lots of choices in the area including another Subway...no need for me to go back here."}
{"text":"While I was waiting for painfully slow service, the manager or owner came in the front door and berated an employee in front of customers...not cool.  That combined with service as slow as mollases made my decission to leave this place and never return a real easy one."}
{"text":"I've been to this place enough times to have a real good read on it.  Ingredients are fresh, one of the girls is excellent, sadly the rest of the staff is average to awful.  The bad, EVERY time I've gone in there, the staff are chattering away in a language that isn't English, often I have to wait for their chats to finish and sometimes they re-start in the middle of my order.  While this is extremely rude to the customers, I chose to live with it.  What I can't live with is; today I walked in and waited for someone to serve me...the guy in the back gave his nose a nice big bare hand wipe and headed out to serve me!  See ya later, that will be my last ever visit here...that's too bad an image to delete..."}
{"text":"Excellent Subway booth in The Plaza's food court.  Good service plus as an added bonus they offered the veggie patty."}
{"text":"You can often see the workers outside smoking and BS'n with friends who visit them.  Totally unprofessional, no smiles, won't be back"}
{"text":"Refused to check allergen information, rude service. I asked them to check a sauce to see if it had dairy and they refused because there was a customer behind me. one customer. The person making the sandwich constantly said \"is that it!?\" in a rude tone. I wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone due to the absolute shit service."}
{"text":"Showed up at 10pm , lights and open sign are all on . Door locked . I wiggled at the door and after a few seconds , 2 employees came from the back . I knocked and they didn't even acknowledge that I was there. Just rude ."}
{"text":"I waited in line for 20minutes. The girl working kept leaning over to grab items and her dirty shirt kept touching my sandwich. That's disgusting and unsanitary. So I just walked away. I'll never come here again."}
{"text":"I got there when it opened during this Summer 2016 semester. I was the first person in line. The guy made my sandwich halfway, then left it on the counter to make the other five people's behind me. He finishes mine, then won't even ring it up, so he can go make more. Granted I know he was the only person working the line while the two ladies in the back just sat there and did nothing, it still shouldn't take 15 minutes to make my damn sandwich as well as five other peoples. If anything he's not at fault, the ladies who work there in the morning should be fired."}
{"text":"My dad is a regular here, couple times a week anyway. He loves the Seafood Sensation and not all SUBWAYS carry it.

Tonight we were greeted by Anthony and Tyler. Anthony even recognized my dad as a regular who is normally not here this time of day.

Service was great and we are on a clean outdoor patio with pop music in the background.

SUBWAY is consistently good and delicious (except tonight they were out of Seafood Sensation)."}
{"text":"Well I had the pleasure of having a sandwich made by a female working on 11-16-2017 around 12:45 a.m. as this is the closest 24 hour subway to me after I get my workout in at EOS up the street I felt I really wanted a nice sandwich for my post workout meal, now I really am a nice guy I tend to be very forgiving to people who don't deserve it most of the time, this African American female worker with a tattoo on her forearm, only reason I'm saying that is so the manager that reads this can signify which person I'm talking about because she didn't have a name tag on at all so I could not put her name directly in this review but anyway, she was very nice to the two people who ordered before me, I'm not one to judge or get upset by how long something takes to make but let me tell you the amount of time it took her to make the second persons subs took around 8-10 minutes nearly while I sat there in the chairs and waited, they seemed to know each other as they talked about their jobs to each other and the one making the subs complained about her hours and how they had to transfer her and blah blah blah, I mean you are at work, please save your side conversations for your lunch or when you aren't on the clock as it could have sped up the process of making those fantastic sandwiches (sarcasm) but anyway! As I approached to order my sandwich she said are you ready and just stared at me I mean obviously I'm ready I just heard your whole conversation between you and your BFF for the last nearly 10 minutes while I could have looked over the entire menu 5 times so yes in short I am ready to order by all means! I'll skip ahead a couple minutes as she is asking me what type of sandwich I am having I say a turkey on the Italian herbs and cheese, what kind of cheese, Swiss I said double meat please she looked at me and said excuse me? I said double meat please, asks if I would like it toasted yes please with bacon and as my sandwich is in the toaster so to speak she takes off her gloves attempts to throw them in the trash and misses, walks in the back mind you without gloves on, in the middle of making my sandwich, is back there for maybe 30-40 seconds comes back out and puts a new pair of gloves on, I was completely unaware that it was okay or in policy to remove your supposed clean gloves in the middle of making someone's food which they are going to eat, if it is in policy I'm sure the policy also states that the employee must wash their hands before returning back to work, so my whole thing is with this female, attitude being number 1, treat your customers respectfully, ALL OF THEM not just who you like and who you chose to like, secondly, if you are going to walk into the back and do god knows what with your bare hands and then touch my food again, please have the common curtesy to WASH YOUR HANDS before touching my food I am going to be eating with MY hands, thank you, so for whoever reads this including management, please have a nice little talk with this particular female on how she should go about her work ethic and policies including food handling, maybe she should go take her food handlers test again, not sure but I won't be going back to this subway anytime soon and I will make sure anyone who asks what's a good or close location to please avoid this establishment all together!! 


THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"I love subway but this location is horrible, I went there about 2 weeks ago and asked for a foot long veggie delight on white and the young man making my sandwich literally just started throwing ingredients on there (lettuce, tomato, olives) without me even asking for a thing or asking me if I wanted it? Luckily I like all that so I then from that moment proceeded to just tell him what else to put on to prevent him from just making me suicide sand which. The worst part was, I had to ask him to put cheese on it when the MAIN INGREDIENT in the veggie delight is cheese?? I'm so confused as to how this kid works here or if he is just really new and confused. Anyways the sand which was crap, and I would recommend avoiding this location."}
{"text":"By far one of the cleanest, best Subways I've been to. Stopped by for a quick sub after work and it was a great experience. The team was happy and bread was fresh. It's obvious the manager Eddie takes great pride in this location. This will be a regular stop every time I'm in the area - super easy to get to. Try the new Lays chip flavors too."}
{"text":"This is it never again will i go to subway. Jersey Mikes has happy trained staff and there for is fresh and delicious every time. I went into this subway today to get a simple salad. I said hello to the young lady behind the counter and i barley got a response. I then asked her what kind of salad do you have and she just shrug your shoulders and said I don't know. Then a teen age boy with a horrible attitude walked in. Neither one of these kids wanted to be there that was easy to see and feel. I asked the boy how was the spinach and with an attitude he said it looks like spinach. I said look smart mouth i wanted know what the quality was. I got my pitiful ugly disgusting salad for $9 what a rip off. But as bad as the food is its nothing compared to the horrible customer service. Please Jersey Mikes come to Anthem"}
{"text":"NOW serving breakfast @subwayfreshbuzz made YOUR way!!! CHEAP + good-not your typical Fast-Food!! I love the whole wheat muffins and being able to load it up anyway you want depending on what mood you are in."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review of a place but the employees here are just terrible. The one girl I see in here regularly is always so rude and never smiles. I've even tried to make small talk with her to try to get her to lighten up a bit and she is just always in a bad mood. Never smiles, is never cheerful. I totally understand that people have bad days but I'm at this subway pretty often and unless I've been unlucky enough to always catch this lady when she's having a bad day, I'd say they need to hire someone else. That, or maybe make a better atmosphere for their employees. I don't know. But they need to do something. I'll keep going here because it's convenient, but that's the only reason."}
{"text":"Rating this versus other chains like it, customer service was friendly, personable and even funny. Greeted promptly as you walked in and toppings were put on with care. Best subway I've been to."}
{"text":"Walked in the restaurant was not clean floors dirty countertops filthy tables needed to be white. Absolutely no customer service no greeting from the two employees at the counter. One appear to be the store manager and the other cashier. I wonder if this will corporate managers at Subway want their stores to look like?"}
{"text":"Super clean and the workers are very friendly!! I go here a lot after school and I've never had a problem"}
{"text":"These guys are a RIP OFF! Ordered online. The Subway website said they were open. When we went to pick up the order, they were closed and are REFUSING to give a refund. Thieves and liars. I lodged a complaint through Subway. Someone from the restaurant contacted me, Brian. When I asked him several times to confirm that his store was closed at 7:45 pm on that day, he refused to answer. He claimed he never received the order (lies -- the store was closed). THEN GIVE ME A REFUND!"}
{"text":"THE ABSOLUTE WORST SUBWAY I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!  They refuse to take off the right amount when you have a coupon, or upcharge.  I ordered a the monthly $5 footlong, then when I went to order the value meal (normally $2 extra) the old lady said she had to RING IT UP SEPARATELY.  They couldn't do a $5 footlong value meal.  I should have just walked out after they charged me $8.67.  The old lady blamed it on the register buttons!  Every other Subway will ring up a $5 footlong value meal for $7 and some change.  Do NOT go here.   This didn't happen just once, but THREE times."}
{"text":"I try to avoid going to this Subway as much as possible. You'll get the same sub that you would at any other Subway, but the employees seem to hate their job and are not very friendly. Customer service is consistently bad. Once, I asked for a cup of water before I paid and the owner just ignored me and took my card. I asked again and waited as he took the next person's card. He seemed irritated that I asked for a cup. My bad. They're very stingy with their veggies too. One time I asked for spinach and there was maybe 3 leafs left so she put those on my footlong and asked what else. I asked if I could have more and she huffed and went to the back to get more spinach. The owner said we'll have to charge you for extra veggies. Weird. Also, if you have OCD, don't watch them make the sandwich. Just tell them what you want and look away and be prepared to have mustard on only half of your sandwich."}
{"text":"This particular location is good, but not spectacular.  I go when I'm in the mood for a sub.  The ingredients appear fresh.  The store is clean and the staff is competent.  I've been at this location on a few occasions at lunch."}
{"text":"Purchased a six inch with combo at this subway and I was charged $8.50. The soda and the drink was half the price of my sandwich? When I went to a different subway for the same meal I was charged $6.30. Won't be going back to this subway."}
{"text":"5 stars, in my opinion, should be based on many factors including expectations, 
Class of restaurant, price category and service ... to name a few. I think this Subway was better than most Subways I have been to ... service, cleanliness, taste, proportions, freshness, etc .. was higher than most, imho. Great place to grab a quick lunch and habe some yummy food."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Slow staff.  Portions getting smaller.  Food isn't fresh."}
{"text":"Good as any other Subway. They were out of steak and some bread. Place looked dirtier than most subways and the one person that served me seemed to not know what she was doing. I went there a couple times with the same results. The manager was there last time and was nice. She was directing people to conduct inventory and helped during rush our at lunch. She was training one person..."}
{"text":"This Subway sucks!!! They charge $1 for refills and they are more expensive than other Subways. There is also no posting that they charge for refills. The hostess also seem to get off telling me it was $1 and the service sucked compared to other Subways I have visited. I will not come back, not that it matters to the owner but if enough people stop buying they will have to change their policy. They suck big time!!!! 1 star is too much but there is no other option!"}
{"text":"You're honestly better off just making your own sub. This is the worst Subway I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Subway is always a safe bet for consistency and a quick healthy enough lunch.

This location is convenient and it's employees have good, quick service. They're very friendly and i always see the owner behind the counter helping to serve as needed.

They honor deals and coupons if you have them for this location. 

Being pregnant, I miss my cold cut combo but their meatball suffices in the meantime!

Also don't forget that they do breakfast sandwiches too!

P.s. I'll always choose this place over Jimmy Johns (because JJ is an avid trophy hunter in Africa- irrelevant but I'd rather give my profits to franchisees like subway over that guy)."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a carry out to take back to our hotel. Sandwiches lacked taste.  Worst subway experience I've had.  They even charge a premium price.  My wife tossed her sandwich in the trash."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this subway location at 10:30pm on Friday June 22nd.There were 3 employees at this location at the time.A male employee balancing the register, and two older women.When my husband entered the Subway ,he was not greeted or acknowledged or anything at all.He stood there, waiting and waiting, and still no employees acknowledged him at all.The male worked was working on the cash register, but the two women were not working at all.One was behind the register and the other female worker was leaning on the opposite site.The two older female workers were just talking to each other, gossiping and talking about their day, still not taking my husband's order, not acknowledging him, not saying nothing.He walked out with them not caring at all.This is rude and unprofessional.The service was terrible.There was no customer service whatsoever.We will never go to this location again.The employees should be fired.They obviously do not care for customer service and their jobs at all, and are so ungrateful when other people can't get a job and would never treat an opportunity for income so poorly."}
{"text":"I've love Subway and this subway made the biggest super full sandwich i've ever seen. Don't know the girls name who made it but would hire that lady just to personally make me subways (if I was rich).   Super clean and super sandwiches...best subway i've been to in a LONG TIME.  I can't believe i just reviewed subway!!"}
{"text":"This subway is next to where I work. It is always clean, the veggies are always fresh for the sandwiches and the staff is amazing."}

No conversations, small talk, or even barely a hello with the customers. I frequent here a lot since its so close.

{"text":"Located in the Albertsons shopping center off of Buffalo in Summerlin. Parking has never been and issue for me here. 

Typical Subway set up. Nothing different. 

This is my new Subway location. The young man that works in here was excellent and made a great sandwich! He was helpful in making recommendations and really took his time with me. Much appreciated. 

Always good to see young people providing great service."}
{"text":"The young man at this subway provided exceptional customer service! From the time I entered the door until I left he was attentive, suggestive, and engaged me as a customer. I witnessed other customers in there eating lunch also express how great he was. They even went so far as to say he should be on the Subway commercial!! I mean his demeanor was very pleasant he greeted me asked about my day and my weekend. Extremely personable and friendly. I was going to get a plain old tuna sandwich for lunch and he suggested cheese and other toppings to jazz my sandwich up. It's not often you receive this type of service, especially in fast food. I had written this location off a while ago because I didn't like the last sandwich I had eaten there. This kid is the only reason I will come back to Subway. I sure hope the CEO and VP's of subway are reading this and promote this young man to customer service trainer!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 6pm, bell rang, no greeting by the young lady sitting in the back as she was too occupied with her phone.

After using the infamous cough for attention, she finally heard us and apologized which was all I wanted to hear. Would've gave in to 4 stars until I found out they were out of ham, spinach, and bell peppers (some of my preferred ingredients). For a 24/7 location, I've never seen a Subway so cleaned out. Could it be that the employee was to lazy to prep the missing ingredients, or management didn't do their job on calculating the amount to order? Either way, for the inconvenience I was STILL charged extra for Avocado."}
{"text":"Closest Subway from all your Red Rock adventures!

Ever wonder how clean a restaurant is behind them closed doors? Like many of the Subways I visit, service was great and the food was fresh! What makes this Subway different is that I was able to take a peek behind the scenes of this fast food restaurant.

I ended up here during an off campus field trip for my HVAC class. My professor was able to set up a date with Ben (manager) for us students to check out how their fridges, freezers, and A/C units are maintained on a quarterly basis. After a long 4 hours of detailed information and walk throughs which many of you would not understand or even care about, all of us were pretty amazed with how often these systems actually need to be cleaned to prevent buildup from occurring. 

Let's just say that if you personally seen the amount of calcium/lime accumulated within 3 months in ice machines, you would not want to get ice from any low end restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Decided to try this subway... First I would like to thank Brittany who was the only employee working and making my sandwich there were two other Mexican girls one was dressed like a guy here just hanging out talking behind the counter doing nothing she asked for help and they ignored her and kept talking this was around 2pm on 6/18 until finally they walked out from the counter and sat down and bailed on her . You shouldn't employ lazy people who just hang out behind the counter. Kudos to Brittany the only person doing her job!"}
{"text":"Had a Turkey Italiano sandwich here it's really good ! For a Subway it's one of the best I've had!  The two young ladies making the sandwiches are very hardworking and nice!"}

{"text":"This subway has less than exceptional customer service. Went in and the girl behind the counter was clearly new and the guy who was also behind the counter seemed uninterested in helping her.

{"text":"Customer service is terrible and they charge higher prices than other Subway stores, stay away!"}
{"text":"I just remember coming here not to long ago with my roommate.  Why is it always packed every time I go into a chain restaurant that has no cars in the parking lot. The physics don't make any sense.

Anyways, this is what you would expect at a subway, the same selection, decent quality, decent value.  My only complaint was that my meatball marinara was never toasted when I told them to toast it.

{"text":"This is practically a drive-thru Subway and I decided to stop at this one because I didn't wan't my ass to explode from eating Little Caesars so I stopped here with my lovely lady.

I am 9999% sure the cashier was on acid or completely baked.  But when you stop mid order to make the sandwich and forget to ask what you want on your sub until it's completely made, it's pretty ineffective.  

In a span of 10 minutes the phrases, \"whuuut?\" \"Hold On...whut?\" \" Wait...\" \"Huh\". \"Um...ooh yeah\" were used at least 3 dozen times.

And they didn't toast my meatball marinara subs.

Their breakfast deals are one of the best, and I wish they had a drive-thru here to make it more accessible. A flat bread sandwich and a coffee or drink for $3 is something that can't be beat.  Get it!"}

The nice thing about this location is the ample parking, well-kept inside, and friendly sandwich artists.  I did notice that the fresh cookie cabinet was fully stocked... I think some other Subway locations around the area have smaller/less diverse selection of cookies."}
{"text":"Normally I am all about small business, \"mom & pop\" restaurants any day, but it is good to have a Subway, especially in downtown Matthews.  Something about being able to get in and out pretty quickly and know that you are getting a consistent product in the form of a sandwich and your choice of toppings....

This location is one of the many eating choices you have in the Matthews area near Town Hall/Library.  The parking can be an issue depending on what time of day you are here especially with the diagonal parking spaces and traffic flow.

Decent size dining room and patio and the sandwich artists are nice and courteous (as per their training I'm sure).  Since the Subway occupies the end of the building row, it makes for an interesting layout (unlike the usual, strip mall longways set up)."}
{"text":"I go here often for lunch.  The place is kept clean and the staff is very friendly.  I can see how Nilay thought the service was lacking in smiles, but I guess everyone has their good and bad days.

It's bad when I walk in and the guys already know what I am going to order.  I try to switch it up for variety, but it's hard to break old habits.  

My only gripe about this place is the shopping center location and it is a little difficult to get out of the parking lot due to a fairly busy intersection on Prosperity Church Rd."}
{"text":"This is most likely the best location in the country. Hands down. The staff treats every person who walks in the door like family and genuinely cares about your experience there. Food is always fresh and prepped. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I am only writing this review because this is one of the few places that has Barq's red cream soda in their soda fountain.

The staff are slow and I always have to ask them to put things on twice because they dish out such small portions. Really? Would it kill you to put some more spinach on my sandwich?"}
{"text":"In Mesa no subway puts double cheese on the chicken bacon ranch... I use to work at subway I know this sandwich gets double cheese. They say a customer is always right but this subway does not believe so. They have argued with me \" I wanted to see how far it would go\" about no extra cheese."}
{"text":"I was in here the other day for lunch and one of the employees was sneezing and wiping her nose on her sleeve.  Not the person I want making my sandwich.  Gross.  If you're sick, you shouldn't be handling food.

Thankfully someone else made it, she only took my money.  The soda machine was broken also so I stuck with water or tea.  Thankfully, I usually opt for unsweet tea anyway but I don't think I'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"Used to come here for something quick during my lunch breaks at work.   It is a typical subway with the counter in the back and a few tables in the front and side.  The service is fast and efficient here but getting out of the parking lot can be a challenge because they placed a dumpster in an odd spot so it blocks your sight of oncoming traffic.

Overall, this is a decent place for a Subway."}
{"text":"The food is average here like any other subway if they pay attention to you and make it right.

I stopped in here for lunch after I dropped something off at the nearby post office.  So I order my foot-long Black Forest ham sandwich on wheat.  Well at least they got the bread right.

As I was looking for my bag of chips I glanced back to see they were making a Tuna sub for me instead of the black forest ham.  When I caught the guy, he threw back the cheese into the bin, scooped off the tuna salad and then proceeded to use the same bread for my sandwich.  

That's when he finally asked me if I wanted new bread which of course I said yes.  But i still got the same cheese.

When finishing the sandwich this guy obviously couldn't remember three things at once because I had to remind him of the tomatos twice and the oregano.  

I don't think I'll be returning to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordered tuna chopped salad and ruben sandwich.  The ruben had very small amount of corn beef and sauerkraut...the roll was the size of a hot dog bun.  No flavor as well.  Terrible sandwich.  The tuna chopped salad was a disgrace.  Small scoop of tuna...ridiculous. Had additional ingredients that were not ordered.  Almost inedible.  Do not go here...go to Fys or Safeway."}
{"text":"The ladies that work here  really are artist of the sandwich!  Every time is a smile"}
{"text":"I live right across the street from here practically so I eat here a lot. It's typically two young guys who help me and my fiance. Both of them are always efficient and quick and there's no judgement when my fiance adds almost every topping to his sandwich haha"}
{"text":"Girls on the subway were ok with customer service. I'm scarred from subway after today I ordered a cold roast beef sandwich BIG MISTAKE... dried put bland meat taste spit out my last bite and threw the other half of my sub in the trash. Told the hound ladies she said \"ohh ok sorry\" nice but it is what to expect from 16 yr old employees don't know the value of a working mans buck lol"}
{"text":"I came here because it's close to my work but I return because of the service. They are always quick to greet me when I come in, and even when they are busy they are still efficient. I add a bunch of veggies and sauce to my sandwich and it's never a problem. They always see to be in a good mood. This is a legit subway."}
{"text":"Short and sweet - because it's a Subway.

Food - well put together sandwich, just the way I like it. They asked me if I wanted it toasted, I said yes, and it was indeed, toasted. Extra point!

The Place - Clean-cut looking establishment. Chairs, tables, etc. all taken care of and clean.

Bathroom - Clean.

Service - Perfect. Two youngish teenager looking boys helped me. They greeted me, they made my sandwich, they said goodbye. 

Overall - 5 Stars. One of the better Subways I've been to in the valley."}
{"text":"This Subway is located in Boulder Station. It is actually a combo place because it has a Winchell's Donuts attached to it. However, I'm not particularly sure if they just share the same space, but not the same employees. 

I've picked up sandwiches for my family and myself quite a few times. It's just really convenient and close to where I live. But unfortunately the service is not too good. This just might be the slowest Subway I've ever been to. Ya know how normally most Subways whip up your sandwich super fast? Not here. Everything goes at a glacial pace and when I'm standing around in stinky cigarette smelling Boulder Station I want to get out as fast as I can!

I'm always disappointed by Subway sandwiches though. They just don't come close to their rival chain Port of Subs, but for some reason Subway dominates the fast sandwich world. The bread is always kind of disappointing and too thin in my opinion. I guess the one good thing here is that they toast your sandwich if you want it toasted, but other than that it's just another Subway sandwich."}
{"text":"This is a very nice Subway. I stopped in here after work one night and was in desperate need of sandwiches for me and my fiance. I happened to have one of those buy-one-get-one coupons I received in the mail and the worker here was very happy to honor the coupon. He didn't even really look at it.

The sandwiches were made very well and the young man behind the counter was very jovial and nice to me. I was afraid it was maybe a bit too late and they were closing, but he ensured me all was good and they were actually open for another hour.

Honestly I've been to a lot of Subways, but this one in particular is being run by very good management because it shows in the decorum of their employees AND the fresh/well put together sandwiches."}
{"text":"Actually went in twice today the staff was so friendly Calvin and Michael was great guys and was in and out brother than two minutes to get a couple sandwiches very tasty refresh my only complaint always was subways is a little more meat damn you guys are stingy"}
{"text":"Only one star because I had too. Just went in for food and heard the conversation about \"aunt flow\" and the employees female issues. Then another employee telling a male employee leaving \"you better call me later or I'll F&$k you up\".
Class act Subway. Highly recommend nobody take kids in and just keep driving to the Safeway Deli. Much better customer service and professionalism. I'm disgusted."}
{"text":"This evening I took my family to the subway located on Warm Springs, between Durango and Buffalo. I ordered a cheese pizza for my kid, a 6\" veggie meal for my wife, and a 12\" veggie meal for myself. I noticed the cheeses and veggies looked subpar, but decided to order against my best judgement since we were already there. While I was filling drinks, my daughter was complaining about her pizza being cold. It was litterally still icy. As I walked up to get it reheated, the only employee (...3rd shift ever) walked off quickly to finish whatever tasks she was attending to. I saw her enter the freezer room on my second attempt to call her over, and again, she doesn't hear me. She was clearly dodging me while fumbling with trash and whatever else. On my third, louder \"excuse me\", she walked over reluctantly. I told her the pizza was cold. She literally grabbed the box with her dirty gloves, and only realized the sanitation error when I called her out for potentially risking my kids health.  I immediately asked for a refund after witnessing this major health hazard. This was a pizza for my 3yr old daughter, and at this point I wasn't confident in eating what I ordered... with just cause. I was denied a refund, even though the only food consumed was a bite of cold pizza... which by the way ruined any chance of her eating dinner tonight. I paid in cash, but they claimed they couldn't open the drawer to refund me. Then, I offered to buy a drink or cookie to get the droor open. I was denied again by a woman named Savanna via phone. After this extremely frustrating and gross experience, I left with an unfed family and partial refund. I can't believe I was expected to eat food after witnessing an unsanitary process. I was not in the wrong, but was penalized somehow. Why is this location allowing an employee with 3 days experience to run the entire restaurant? She clearly doesn't understand basic health department protocol. No respect! Terrible service! UNSANITARY!!!"}
{"text":"I strongly recommend another location as the food at this location is substandard compared to every other location in Vegas. If your use to eating at subway then you really wanna skip this location! Staff put way to much sauce on the subs, usually everything has freezer burn, staff lack English, and the place is filthy."}
{"text":"Theresa
I tried the new enchilada sub and I LOVED it. The meat doesn't look good but it tastes really good.  What really makes this Subway awesome is Theresa.  She is really helpful walking me through on what she thought would be the best for the new sandwich she was funny.  And had dog treats for our dogs outside. And she didn't put too much veggies on but not too little. Between Theresa and the new sub I am def going to come back."}
{"text":"This is a clean store and they are very quick to make your sub. Even if there is a line when I walk in, I am always surprised at how fast they are able to help you so you can be on your way. The owner here is so nice and will remember you if you visit here often. Great Subway!"}
{"text":"No issues.  Easy.  I got a 6\" meatball sub, which I wasn't super hungry and they did fine on it.  It only cost me $2 + tax.  I was pleasantly surprised, as I didn't even know there was a sale going on."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to not go to either of the Subways we went to yesterday.  Our son was still doing chess in north Scottsdale, so we decided to come to a different one.  This was pretty much perfect.  The kid that helped us was like a 10 star on service out of a 5 star.  He was wonderful and I wish all service people were as great as him.

I believe his name is Max, which is what the receipt said.  He was super friendly, courteous, professional, very polite, and had a good personality.  He treated every customer, including us well.  This is one of the bigger Subways we've been to.

I notice there were repeat customers and he knew their orders as they entered the place.  He made people feel at ease.  This place was clean, well kept, organized, and appealing.  Everything was working well.

This is the perfect Subway."}
{"text":"Came to this location because it was somewhat close to the school our son was playing chess at.  He wanted Subway.  We came at probably 11:45 am on Saturday and didn't think it would take that long.  We've never been to a subway that we had to wait that long.  They had quite a few people working, but the line was long nearly out the door and that was with a bend in the line.

The cash register wasn't working, so they couldn't print receipts and had to take them with an iPhone and then I always get receipts, so I had it send it to me email, which I had to type in.  The girl had to had calculate things.  What a mess.

We ordered our subs, went and dropped off with our son and then came back to order our subs.  The line was so long again, and this is now probably 1:45 pm.  We decided not to join the line and went to another Subway on Shea and the 101 instead, which is a few miles away.

We didn't want to have to go through the manual register.  Maybe they were having a bad day.  I don't know.  The staff seemed pretty stress and they could have used more help.

If this place is this busy, they need to hire more people and fix the register.  I felt bad for the employees."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd Subway we went to because the one on Via Linda was so jam packed.  There were only a couple customers and a couple employees here when we showed up.  This was a small Subway.  Service wasn't fast, but it wasn't slow.  

The black guy knew what he was doing, but he wasn't super friendly.  He seemed a little impatient.  The white guy seemed a little nervous, like he was learning.  They were very just curt, not rude, but not really friendly.

Food was fine though.  We got served pretty quickly, which we were starved.  The subs were great.  Service was okay."}
{"text":"I think this is the last chance my family will give subway. Right when you walk in it's like taking a step back in time. Very basic and always looks a bit dirty. Service is always bland at at times it's like pulling teeth to get someone to even look at you while helping take your order. This is the second time I've been in where the bread is hard like it's been left out all night. The only thing keeping this place alive are the prices and even those seem to be creeping up. I'd rather spend my money at another sub sandwich business with better service and quality."}
{"text":"Reggie made me the best sandwich tonight! I hardly  go to subway anymore because I feel like my sandwich is thrown together and made with no love. But tonight Reggie made me the perfect sandwich! He took his time and was so nice! Only coming in when he's working!"}
{"text":"Best service at a Subway I've ever received!  And the ladies were blasting the best 80's dance music!

And to some the Tuna sandwich sounds gross, but it's actually very good.  Try it toasted!"}
{"text":"I agree with the negative reviews on this subway location. Today I purchased a chopped salad for almost $8 but it filled only about 30% of the container. When I asked for some more spinach leaves, I received 2 leaves with each request -- I asked a few times; it was almost humiliating. Please standardize your portions and stop exploiting students."}
{"text":"Sometimes the breads not fresh. Never enough meat. People not friendly. Now they raised prices so im done with subway. Krazy sub was great as an option."}
{"text":"Showed up at 9:20pm for a quick bite at this Subway which has a giant sign that says \"Open 24hrs\". Was turned away by security saying that the food court was closed. When I questioned about the 24hrs they replied \"I don't know if they're done prepping\". What exactly do they need to prep for if they're \"Open 24hrs\"?? SO glad I wasted my time walking the mile from the casino floor to the food court for nothing. Maybe time to change that 24hr sign, eh??"}
{"text":"Soild subway nothing too special nothing too bad. They keep one of the doors locked which can be annoying if you don't know which one. However, overall it is a great place. I come here often and it is always super fast to serve me. They have a bathroom that you need a key for if anyone wants to know."}
{"text":"I actually really like Subway.

Sure, it's a fast food chain, but I really do like what they do. I like the fresh bread that they bake right on site, so it always smells great here. They have about 6 choices - my favourite is parmesan oregano.  I also like the variety of toppings that are virtually unlimited, and the sub sauce. I actually learned that they don't have the sub sauce in the US (not in NYC anyways), so Canadians - enjoy what you have!

Last of all, with any fast food place, I like the speed and service I get. Long lines tend to move quickly - they've really got the assembly line down. And the price - i don't think you can get a cheaper lunch, especially in the Finance District, at $5 for foot long and $2.99 for a 6 inch. I have spent many a lunch and dinner when working late here, and have enjoyed every one!"}
{"text":"This is a good subway to go to. It's close to shopping and other things on the way during the day, it's a clean store with friendly employees who usually go out of their way to make good sandwiches. Many of them have been there for a while which is nice too, because they're glad to see you and vice-versa, and already know the type of sandwiches that you like.

I had the rye and corned beef 6\" sub last time I was there and it was delicious. They do well on all of the sandwiches they make usually, but that one turned out to be really tasty. Will I be back? Yep, next time I'm shopping or in the area I will be."}
{"text":"The best sandwich I ever had was at this store about a week ago. I've been to many different Subway stores, and while some are better than others, none have been able to get it 100% right until I got a Subway Club 12\" from here.

The employee Briana made it just perfect on the toppings and the toast settings. Maybe it's just me, but the bread seemed a lot more fresh than from the other Subways I've stopped in to.

Everything about this place was quality, and it seems to be one of the cleaner stores, too. Glad I stopped in here the day I did. I seldom tip fast food, but I decided to this time. It was totally worth it. (Visited on 8/13/15 I think)"}
{"text":"I love this Subway...the food is always super fresh, the place is spic and span...the employees are very pleasant and friendly.  They help you with the door, drink lids...and even remember your orders if you are a regular.  It's the best Subway around!"}
{"text":"Subway recently started an online ordering as part of their iPhone app, something I have been waiting for.  I have to say, it works great!  You choose your restaurant and place the order, and pay with the app.  I usually use this location since it is the closest to my house and gym.  Each time I have ordered, they have it ready and waiting for me.  All I have to do is pick it up and head back to the car."}
{"text":"It's just a subway but what makes it different is the people who work here. Carmen and Julio remember who you are and what you like. It makes for a very pleasant experience. Kudos to whoever hired them."}
{"text":"If you want unfriendly service come here. I don't care for subway much but for work lunch meetings this place seemed like the place to go for something quick and simple. The service is poor. I hope these ladies take a class on customer service because  your ghetto mad faces and attitudes are giving your subway a bad name. Just saying. I may have to look for another location for future meeting purposes."}
{"text":"Always clean, and the food is fresh.... A little on the healthy side but if you happen to be in the mood for that this is a friendly location"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and it was great. I had the double chicken spinach salad and a bottle of water. The chicken and veggies were fresh and very good. 

The staff was friendly and quick to get your meal ready. 

If you need a quick good meal then stop by this Subway."}
{"text":"Ok, first of all, when I got there this morning to pick up my lunch,  the guy behind the counter was hitting on the gal in front of me so hard.  He spent all of his time and smiles on her that by the time he got to my order, he had not an ounce of friendliness left.  He acted like he was doing me a favor, begrudgingly.  That in itself is nothing, I have lowered my expectations of customer service since this new generation of pimple popping orgy addicts got their work permits a few years ago.  However, when I got the foot-long turkey sammi back to my office, the half I chose for breakfast had a little good morning suprise. (I just threw up in my mouth a bit.)
They should change their slogan from \"Eat Freash!\" to \"Eat Some Complete Stranger's Hair, Then Gag and Lose Your Appetite Completely\".  I'll bet that is the real reason Jared lost all that weight.  
Not happy Subway.  There is  a lovely Quiznos on Central and Camelback... They will serve my periodic sub sandwhich needs from now on.
AND DON\"T CALL ME MAAM YOU IDIOT!  And get your teeth cleaned! That yucky yellow stuff is called tartar and it can be removed."}
{"text":"Its cool.. 24hr drive-thru tho lol"}
{"text":"Not really a big fan of subway in general but I love this location.... It's open late, I think it's 24hrs. It's a clean, small store but the staff is so extra courteous. They know all the ingredients that go with the sandwiches, I usually make up my own but the odd time a new sandwich comes out, like the delicious pulled pork sub so I want to try it as the company has it planned, then make tweaks if I need to. However most places the people know nothing.... The quickly run out of things like spinach and they do not restock all night to your out of luck if they run out. But at this location I've never had that issue.

I like the fact that the location is extremely clean, they seem to really keep up with it as well inside and out which is refreshing. They have signs posted asking you to rate the sandwich you get, they always ask if your satisfied so you really get what you pay for and more. 

I travel out of my way to this place because the quality and service, I don't plan on stopping anytime soon either lols!"}
{"text":"So here's the deal... Subway is subway. I leave reviews for these chain restaurants mostly based on the location and service. 

The sandwich I got (chicken breast) was about what you can expect for $5. 

The guys working in the back were friendly and fast. Very personable. 

There were some homeless folks right outside, they are here in the shopping center pretty often, not always by the subway, but in the vicinity. I give them a few bucks every once in awhile...if I'm gonna be honest its annoying to see the same three or four able bodied men there week after week. I wish someone would kick them out."}
{"text":"Zero stars can I just say two Sundays in a row they were either closed or did not accept debit cards. How convenient when I work across the street and want to eat healthy! Screw you Subway"}
{"text":"My experience here has always been average. But today ruined it all!! I walked in to order and as I waited for the lady she was eating food then went straight to gloves to make my sandwich, no hand wash prior to putting them on. I asked her to go wash since I saw and she ignored me. So she was making my sandwich and very sloppy then finished. Then any veggies that were floating around she grabbed and ate right there then didn't change gloves to work on next sandwich!!"}
{"text":"I love subway but the service here sucks way to slow!!!!!! Rather go to another location even though it's 2 minutes from my house"}
{"text":"I'm just going to re-use my review from the \"Food Court at Fashion Show Mall\" page (http://www.yelp.com/biz/food-court-at-fashion-show-mall-las-vegas), where you can find reviews of other dining options. 

A-OK, as it is Subway (not the food court). We all know what you get, and this location (like them all), delivers on the product. 

Wife and I hit this Subway in the Fashion Show Mall, and as it was before noon, decided to try one of their breakfast sandwiches. Until now, I did not even know that Subway made breakfast sandwiches. 

I was a bit nervous when I saw the sandwich-builder (is there a special name for this person?) pull out the pre-cooked egg that looked more like a crepe (not sure what I was expecting), but after dressing it up (bacon and cheese) and a quick trip through the microwave, then toss on some veggies, it was actually pretty decent. 

The foot-long fed the both of us, so I can't really complain."}
{"text":"Average Subway - crowded at lunch.  Service is acceptable."}
{"text":"Subway is Subway.  All the restaurants are the same so you know what you are getting most of the time.  You can't plan for unfriendly workers at any restaurant.  We had some visiting people from the UK at work and they ate their almost every day for 2 weeks; just to get the flat bread.  Personally I prefer the regular sub bread.  

A foot long combo is almost $10.  Not the cheapest.  I prefer Diabello's in Market Square.  This place is right next to Brueggers.  Not sure why there are so many Subways and Brueggers in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"After a longs day and all the junk food - we wanted to end the day with something decent and so chose this subway.

we were shocked to pay over $20 for 2 sandwiches (saw the news recently and sure this would not have been more than 10 inches) 

other places would have been just as good and probably the same price if we had known"}
{"text":"Yikes. Horrible customer service. I asked for another slice of bread (that I would of paid for if necessary) but I was never asked. Instead she looked at me as if I was a insect. 
I was only asking for more bread because my sandwich was doughy and wet. 
Really disappointed by the attitude of both ladies on the line today. Not very nice."}
{"text":"Much akin to chess, the creation of the ideal Subway sandwich is an artform equally easy to learn and exquisitely difficult to master. This may sound like a jest, but I assure you, having worked at three Subways in the crash course that was my early twenties, I'm something of an authority on the matter. There are innumerable variables at play: veggie to hot pepper to dressing ratio (woe to he who receives an overly soggy sandwich), bread crispness v. density, cheese distribution--to say nothing of the perils of the perfect wrapping up of all that footlong goodness at the end of the line. Never has this reviewer been disappointed by the work of the sandwich artists at this particular Subway. The owner (?), while curt (but in the good-natured style of, say, a New York deli owner), delivers a consistently delicious and competently, even elegantly, plated product. Furthermore, the restaurant is always clean and during the inevitable lunch rush, things move at an adequate clip in the queue. The chips and drinks are always loaded in to the gills and glowing pleasantly from their respective cases. Swing by this location for a picturesque sub handed over with a grumpy smile. You'll only thank yourself later."}
{"text":"The only Subway I'll go to that's close to my house. I have a bad bed schedule so I'm usually up at 2 AM, this is the one closest to my house that's 24 hours a day and everyone there doing the graveyard shift know my order by heart. The food is always really fresh and I always use my coupons for a $6 meal. My sandwiches are always made to perfection and taste amazing! Don't go during lunch rush though, you'll be there forever because it's in a business park so every dressed up workaholic is in there and you'll never get your food. I recommend going in the late hours of the night if you get the chance."}
{"text":"Today I came here for a quick breakfast. I ordered a footlong with turkey, cheese  and toppings that will last me throughout lunch as well. Subway also has coupons both online and in the mail, typically for a buy a 6\"inch and get the 2nd one free with purchase of a drink. Normally, this comes out to roughly 7 or 8 dollars depending on what you order. Its a great deal, especially if you can eat your order in 2 meals throughout the day. This restaurant location was very clean and organized. The staff that was there in the morning was super friendly. If you are hungry for subway and not sure which location to go to, you should check this one out. There is parking in the shopping center, and its easy to get to off the 215/buffalo exit."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this two stars was because my problem was resolved.  Food wasn't bad, staff was alright and not completely to blame...  but the reason I'm writing a review at all is because of a situation that, in my mind, really should not have happened.  (Edit: For clarity, I ordered this online for delivery.  Why?  Because how often do you come across a Subway that delivers?)

Let's first take a moment to discuss a BLT.  Pretty simple sandwich, right?  BLT: Bacon Lettuce Tomato; a sandwich so bold, so forthright that it needs no further explanation.  Adding things to it is on you, of course, so when I ordered Subway's BLT I kept that in mind, assuming there would be no issues with such a simple base.

What I end up with is my order... sans the lettuce and tomato.  I couldn't make this up: A BLT without lettuce and tomato.  Normally, I'm the type of person who kind of shrugs off minor mistakes (mostly because I'm too hungry and the food is still consumable), but 1/3 of my sandwich is completely missing; I was too hungry NOT to do anything about it.  A phone call to the store has me talking with the manager, telling me about the standard subway policies.  Basically, the only standard on the sandwich is the meat, and everything is up to you.  So... there really is not point in even telling them the name of the sandwich you want and adding to that--you have to name what's in it and what you want added to that.  I fail to see the logic in having pre-constructed sandwiches at all.

So unless you're in the restaurant guiding them step-by-step on how to make your sandwich, you'll pretty much have to tell them, \"Yes, I want bacon AND lettuce AND tomato in my BLT.\" (For future ref: if you really want bacon in your BLT, you're going to have to order double meat, or you'll just end up with the essence of bacon.  Those little slivers of bacon really don't cut it.)

I'd go into things about using common sense even if Subway's policies say otherwise... but then I'd be breaking Yelp's review guidelines. (;  I'm also not going to talk about the sub shop within walking distance that stays open until 3am and seems to have it together (as far as BLTs go.)"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the \"not-so-good\" locations I've been to. Not recommending this place, try another Subway."}
{"text":"Great staff, great sandwiches, great service, great atmosphere.  

In essence, great everything :)  If you took a snapshot of my  visits with the excellent everything, that's how every experience should be for everyone."}
{"text":"This is a great subway.  Yes it's a little hidden in the Target and Big Lots parking lot, but the service is wonderful, the food is great and all around fantastic.  Very often not horribly busy when I go there (then again i usually am not in during the busy time anyway).  I would definitely recommend going to this subway."}
{"text":"Well it's Subway. What else do you expect. Nothing real good and nothing real bad. To be honest I try to stay away from Subway ever since I heard about the chemicals they use in their bread being same as yoga mats..but my options were very limited this night in downtown Glendale. So we came here. We didn't notice that they close at 9pm and we walked in at 8:58. No ill will from the 2 employes working and they were happy to make our sandwiches. So 3 stars. On a side note the area can be \"lively\" in the historic area of Glendale, so enjoy the people watching.lol."}
{"text":"I went to subway to eat today.  It was during the lunch hour rush.  They were very speedy - i ordered 3- 6\" subs.  Everything was cooked and made perfectly.  3 sandwiches in about 5 minutes or less.  VERY FAST.  I did feel bad for the guy making the sandwich, he seemed to be taking on most of the load, maybe the girl was new?  Highly recommend the place - it was clean and fast. you can't ask for much more from a Subway."}
{"text":"Worst Subway EVER!!! Do not come here they do not know how to make subs. They are always out of vegetables and meats they don't even know how to charge. They charged me 6.99 for an extra side of chicken. HORRIBLE SERVICE no wonder it's always empty here I will never return!"}
{"text":"Yes..it is strange that I am writing a review for Subway. I get it!!!!!!!!!  One because I don't like Subway sandwiches and two..because it is flippin'Subway!  But I do have to boast about their new breakfast items that they just released!  I tried it this past weekend and trust me...was skeptical...veeeerrryyyy skeptical.  I had an egg and cheese omelet on honey oat bread and added bell peppers, onions and tomatoes! It was yummy!!!!  And...it was only $2.50! Sweet deal!  Definitely going back:)"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go to this subway if somebody paid me. The owner is a disgusting excuse of a human being. He literally spat on female customers who had to call the police. Please do not go here and support him. Clearly there are many other reviews stating what an awful person he is and how he has not respect for staff or customers. It amazes me he still has a business. I'm assuming it's strictly due to location."}
{"text":"If I substitute out one meat, EVERY OTHER SUBWAY I HAVE EVER BEEN TO has not charged me for it. This is the ONLY one that does. (Example: I get the Italian BMT but do double salami, no pepperoni when the sandwich is salami and pepperoni as the meat. No EXTRA meat, just a different one.)

Why pray tell? Because if they don't charge me, they can't keep track of their stock of what meats they have and which ones they don't have... ? Somehow ALL THE OTHERS have figured it out.

Lazy franchise, I'll go to the drive through Subway instead."}
{"text":"I'm starting to really like their tuna sub. This location always seems to have fresh bread and good service which is important since I've been to locations that did not deliver that. I like how near this place is to my home and very clean. I also love the meatball sub and the sweet onion teriyaki chicken sandwich as well."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, subway standard, but they ran out of soup on a cold chilly day and I had to wait in the loooong lunch sandwich line to find out."}
{"text":"Didn't end up eating here because when I walked in the lone employe was rubbing her nose w her hands, even when she then grabbed a pair of gloves, I was still pretty disgusted. When I asked if they had soup, she then looked in the kettle and said \"we probably have enough to make a cup\". On a road w multiple Subway locations, you need to be on point. I drove about 5 min and went to another bright, clean location."}
{"text":"I love all the people on here acting like subway needs to be a Michelin star restaurant laughable. This is a great location the staff are super friendly I come here at least twice a week if not more because they are so great. They remember me and my sandwich every time I walk in and I am always greeted with a hi welcome to subway on the way in the door. Anyone who says the customer service in here is lacking is probably walking in like a dick because I have never seen a single one of these employees be rude or even testy with a customer. Def the best subway on this side of town and is 24/7 can't beat that literally open at all hours for your late night snacking needs."}
{"text":"The food here is okay in comparison with another nearby sub place.  The meat is pre-sliced and comes from packages.  The bread is usually a bit on the stale side."}
{"text":"One employee working at this place!! Poor customer service!! Terrible service! Waited in line forever! 8 customers deep and only one employee doing all the work!! Stay away from this place when its lunch time!!!  Very amusing to see how many customers walked in and just walked out because of the long line. Waited over 15 minutes for a sandwich!! Totally Ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff
Great speedy service"}
{"text":"The sandwiches I get from this location are always very tasty. I haven't ever had to throw my leftovers away because of a bad sandwich. However, I do not always have a good time dealing with the employees. Whenever I come in after 8pm, they are rude to me and act like I'm walking in one minute before they're closing. It has made for some very awkward experiences. Overall, I enjoy going to this Subway for lunch and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Worst customer  service I have had in a long time. I go to this location often for lunch since I work around the corner, I came in today to grab a quick sub and it was def not quick. The young lady preparing my sandwich was on her cell phone the entire time using her Bluetooth. It cause her to not pay attention to any of the customers in the store and she had to ask multiple times what the customer had just said. What a joke! Why does this person even have a job if they can't take a job at subway serious."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of subway, but it's close to my job so I come here several times a month. It's typical subway food, so I'm not rating based on that. All the employees are always so nice and fast! Especially Gwen! Will continue to come here and get mediocre food, but with amazing customer service! (I got the buffalo chicken sandwich, it's not advertised but they'll make it for you)"}
{"text":"Great location. Right next to Dunkin Donuts. Service today was a pleasure. The sole girl making the sandwiches was super nice and attentive. She also kept the place immaculate. 5 stars"}
{"text":"It's subway so there's not really much of a wow factor. They must not drug test at this location. Employees look like something out of the film \"fear and loathing in Las Vegas\""}
{"text":"Came in here right around 6pm on a Sunday night. The Culvers parking lot was jammed packed while the subways was empty. I went inside and couldn't tell if the place was about to close or not as no one was in there. Out walked a disheveled and slightly confused young man. 
I ordered the roasted chicken breast. He began making my sandwich by placing the frozen chicken breasts on the bread. I reminded him they would need too be heated up since it is a warm meat sandwich. He looked upset as he placed the frozen chicken in the microwave . I then requested all the veggies minus pickles. He proceeded to put the lettuce on which only covered 1/2 the bread. I asked him to please put more lettuce on the whole sandwich. He then proceeded too throw the rest of the veggies on with no regard to placement. Both halves of the sandwich was different! When it came time to close and roll the sandwich he was unable too as he poorly slapped it together. Then then had an f it attitude and rolled the sandwich up without closing it. 
Once back at work I unrolled the sandwich and it went everywhere! Too top it off the chicken was still frozen
I think this poor excuse for an employee is the reason why the place was empty on a Sunday night while the place next door was packed! I will not give my money to a place that employees people like this too represent them!"}
{"text":"Over the multiple times I have been here I've noticed that the employees don't change their gloves when handling food and the things around them. Of course I remind them to  change their gloves, but I shouldn't have to. This place needs major education on sanitary and food handling. I'm not returning."}
{"text":"Idk what it is that makes this subway taste so much better than others but for some reason it does. I love the food here more than any other subway that I frequent. Every employee I've encountered here too is very solid. Great customer service, very friendly and hard working. All that and they have an exclusive pepper mix that I literally haven't found anywhere else that adds so much flavor to their food. Love it all, keep it up!!"}
{"text":"I've had Subway many times before moving to Arizona so I know they have good sandwiches. However, I will never eat at this particular Subway. My husband ordered two Turkey sandwiches to go and it was literally the worst sandwich I ever had in my life. Stale bread, and something definitely funky with the turkey, cheese, and lettuce. Like they used old ingredients.  I was sharing my sandwich with my 3 year old but after tasting it, I threw it in the garbage because I was afraid that we were going to get sick. Will not try anything from there again."}
{"text":"It is what is is for a subway.  You know what you are signing up for when you walk in, so to expect something spectacular is silly.  This one is clean, employees are t idiots.  Not sure what else could be expected. I eat here 1-2x a week for lunch, never been sick so how do you not give 5stars..."}
{"text":"Terrible business.

I showed up at lunch time and they didn't have any roast beef, so I couldn't order the sandwich that I wanted.

I also had to correct them multiple times from making the wrong sandwich to toasting my sandwiches when I didn't want them toasted.

Every Subway experience I have had within the last few months has been shockingly awful.  The standards and employee expectations at these establishments are so far below the national average that it is almost laughable how bad the customer service has become."}
{"text":"Clean store with excellent service and tasty food. The servers were welcoming and capable. Handled our large group well."}
{"text":"Love subway, but the employee Erica is rude and has zero personality.  She needs an attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Slowest subway in the country. Only went here because THEY mailed coupons to my house. There was two people in front of me and the whole process took about 45 minutes just to find out they wouldn't take the coupon that they mailed. I paid the full price anyway because I couldn't stand to wait there any longer."}
{"text":"Very clean good service.  Can you beat a 6 dollar sub with all the fixing 
Enjoy fast I and out or quiet dining."}
{"text":"Huh? I read the other reviews. I don't understand that at all. I work up this area and eat at this establishment quite a bit. I know if I show up way later service is slower but lunch time at least, 3 making sandwiches and in order and sit down eating pretty quick for the most part. And they have always been for the most part friendly people. I have eaten at other establishments where I would agree with the previous post but not this one."}
{"text":"Just left this location. The young man that made my sandwich here at 8:00pm on a Sunday was very respectful and did a very good job.  I appreciated his hospitality. I have eaten at many different subway locations and was very pleased with my experience at this one. Thank You!"}
{"text":"This subway has it all! I was greeted by a nice older fellow who asked me what i wanted in a lovely middle eastern accent. I asked him where he was from but i guess he didnt hear me because he didn't reply. No matter, my sandwich came out nice and tender. After it was finished i paid the gentleman and he went into the back area to talk on his bluetooth headset. 

The sandwich was great, it was a nice warm summer night so i opted to eat outside, and being a Friday, i was surrounded by a gaggle of vibrant and friendly denizens of downtown Calgary. 

Enough about the sandwich though, what really caught my eye was the posters and lifesize cardboard cutouts of Jared Fogel, the former subway spokesperson, and convicted child diddler. I'm not sure if this location didn't get the memo about this or what, but they still display this child molesters image prominently throughout the store. I thought about telling the employee about this, but i realised it was not my place to do so. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."}
{"text":"This location is a pain in the ass......I went into this location on Friday 08/21/2015 and purchased an Italian BMT that's 6.75 plus tax (7.31).......after checking my bank statement on Saturday 08/22/2015 the cashier actually charged me 73.10......I've been calling and have been given the run around every time I call......The unprofessional manager Tammy told me she doesn't have the authority to authorize my refund......she told me she has to call the credit card company which I don't understand because you aren't the credit card holder so there's nothing the credit card company can do for you......my thing is there is no sense of urgency at this location the manager could care less about what's going on and she doesn't care about assisting me......."}
{"text":"I am so happy with this Subway. Our group of 6 rolled up around 6:30am on a Monday to stock up on subs for the Mount Zion hike we had planned for later that day. The server was so patient with us even though we each had complicated orders, including asking for sauces on the side. She was super friendly and helpful the entire time.

I ordered a 12-inch spicy Italian sub ($5.75), which is two layers of salami and two layers of pepperoni. You can add any of a variety of toppings including cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, green peppers, olives, banana peppers, and jalapeños. They also have a choice of sauces including sweet onion, honey mustard, southwest, chipotle, and creamy sriracha. I love how customizable their sandwiches are, although when they are busy it does lead to some waiting time since making each sandwich takes a couple minutes. 

In addition, Subway has this amazing deal throughout the month of May - buy any sub before 9am and get a free six-inch breakfast flatbread!"}
{"text":"Had the Philly cheese stake sandwich. It was all right .am so full right now ! Lol  The customer service great no hassle on how we wanted the sandwiches . The employee was friendly ."}
{"text":"Were visiting from los Angeles so this is are first time here. Very clean and great customer service! Food was made quick and no problems with are meals! Will be back on are next visit!"}
{"text":"The man was rude to me and my family. Didn't pay attention to what we were trying to order. And before we finished paying, he had his phone on one hand and the other was on the computer. I'm only giving this one star due to poor customer service."}
{"text":"First off I LOVE Subway in general.  Just not this particular location.  I am a fan of the Veggie Sub personally, and usually they load on the toppings, since it's all made of veggies only.  After my workout last week I stopped at this location instead of my usual W.117th & Madison Ave location.  My mistake.  I paid my $5 usual foot long price...I might as well have asked for just bread and cheese.  The sandwich was so wimpy, I had to keep asking the \"Sandwich Artist\" to add more veggies.  After my 2nd attempt at asking for more green peppers than just 2 strings of it, I gave up hope and walked out there, still hungry from the too-humble offerings from the Sandwich Artist.  I will continue to go to my usual location on Madison Ave from now on."}
{"text":"I feel really silly writing a review about Subway, but this location bothers me like no other. I mean one thing that bothers me about all Subways are the one napkin rule and those darn sleeves they give you as a bag.

Anyway this location is a disaster. I hate being that person, but you cannot understand any of the employees which makes it very hard to order. If I were at a German, Thai, Korean, Chinese restaurant or even if I were at Epcot in Florida I would be able to take their regional dialect, but I'm in Subway I should be able to know that you're asking me what type of cheese I want.

My other chief complaint is that they are so chincy with their vegetables. I mean. You know when you eat Subway you're normally hungry probably 15 minutes later, so being a veggie hoarder doesn't help my hunger pains. Every time I go in I have to ask them, \"can you please put more lettuce on my sandwich\". But as for light mayo and you get a pounds worth of dressing on your 6 inch sub.

There are plenty of other Subway's in the downtown area so you have no reason to go to this one."}
{"text":"It was nice to know that you can go to any Subway and can expect the food to taste the same. I guess that's what franchise shops are doing so well.
Anyhow, since this Subway is inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel (near the Shark Reef) their price is higher then near home. I was happy to find them. 
Ordered 2 one feet breakfast sandwiches, a milk, an OJ for $25. Not bad compared to cafe's 1 one omelette costs about $18."}
{"text":"It's a subway.....my ham and egg white sandwich came out exactly as expected.....cheap and slightly squished. The one thing that stood out was the location: G H E T T O! Take a look at my photos. The drive thru lane was so slanted I thought my car was going to tip over."}
{"text":"Just like any other Subway, but service here was super friendly. Everyone said hi, and they didn't sound fake. Unlike over here in San Jose, they are actually super nice! One thing that did creep  me out about Subway was that the eggs that go on their breakfast sandwich was premade and sitting in one of those containers in front of you. NOt attractive at all.
Also, in Vegas, there aren't many mom-pop places to eat. it's like fast food heaven. so Subway is one of your healthier choices."}
{"text":"Went here to get two subway sandwiches for lunch with my daughter and the clerk who took my order was lazy and impatient and his name was John. The manager who initially started the sandwich put one slice of meat and one slice of cheese. These are absolutely the most pathetic subway sandwiches I've ever seen. I don't expect them to be overflowing but I do expect some substance! There was also no vinegar or mayo which I asked for. Won't be back and judging from the behavior of the people that work there they would prefer not to have any customers at all."}
{"text":"This is the best subway I have ever been to. The guy working there was awesome and super polite. Place was clean and the food was fresh and great. So cool to live within walking distance.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This Subway gets very busy at lunch but the line seemed to move pretty quick. I ordered a tuna sub, which was the sub of the day. I have noticed that all of the Subways have cut way back on toppings, when I am to the end of the line it is a pretty sad looking sandwich. I will probably continue to go to Subway because with their coupons I can get lunch for under $8 and it is convenient to me but this is by no means the best sandwich option around."}
{"text":"I normally love Subway, but in this case, my sub sandwich was unsatisfying. There was no line up when I arrived, but somehow it took a solid ten minutes to get a sub made, my sandwich was burnt to a crisp, and the employees were not giving the sub enough substance. For instance, they gave minimal lettuce, cucumbers, onions and cheese. Not to mention, none of the employees seemed positive or even the least bit cheerful."}
{"text":"I really like this subway! They are all very nice. Everytime I go in I see someone cleaning, which makes me feel confident that the restaurant is hygienic. They aren't stingy with the veggies which I love! I make the choice to come here instead of the other subway down the street."}
{"text":"I went here and ordered a sandwich. The staff was nice, and they made my sandwich correctly... for some reason, it just didn't taste as good as other locations. 

Maybe it's just me, but I will give it another shot one day."}
{"text":"Decent quality Subway. Service was alright. Did as they were told just like any other Subway.

No complaints about this Subway other than the service could be a little more friendlier. The sandwich that I had on my visit tasted great!"}
{"text":"Even though most Subway's I have gone to have the same food, this one stands apart on the service. It is horrible. The female owner is rude and should never own a business. She mumbles when you talk to her and there is never a smile on her face. Her attitude rubs off on her workers as well."}
{"text":"I have a border-line sick obsession with Subway.  In fact, I eat Subway most every workday.  Reason is, for the price you really can't get better than a well put together sub.

With that said, I have visited more Subway restaurants that most anyone.  Additionally I know all of the requirements for what makes a good Subway and what doesn't.

This subway, just off Pharmacy Avenue is easily the best within a 5km radius of 404 and Steeles Ave East in Markham.  I know, because I have been to the other 3. It is nestled inside of a mini-mall filled with shops that no one really enters.  Parking is almost never a problem, unless the church nearby is having a funeral.

The staff are simply incredible.  They go out of their way to make their regulars feel welcome.   I'm not the only regular, I have met several over the many years that I have been there for lunch.  They don't rush you, and always make sure you are happy with your order before they wrap it up.

They generally are their busiest between 12:00 noon and 1pm, but you will never see them complain to show anger; even when the odd pain-in-the-arse customer attempts ruffles their feathers.  

The owner is their sometimes, or his wife, and they make sure to let their customers know they are valued.  I have had many conversations with them, and when I do have a question e.g. when is the spinach coming back? They come back with answers after they speak to head office.

The inside is always clean, stocked with all the extras, and has a warm feelings.  There are plush leather chairs throughout so if you wish to stay you can have a relaxing lunch.  

If you are looking for a place to make your permanent lunch spot, I highly recommend this Subway."}
{"text":"Ok, look. I don't want to be the jerk that complains about a subway. It's fine, it's fresh, it's subway. You know what you are getting.
I just feel I need to warn everyone that you will not get out of here in under thirty minutes. Ever. Even if you are the only customer. Everyone will be super pleasant, there will just never be any sense of sandwich urgency. I'm here weekly, which means that I should probably be put on the payroll there just for the time I spend in the store."}
{"text":"Never order from this location. Made an online order. Got a confirmation number as well as email. Payment processed through my bank. Went to pick up order and they would not give me my order. They claim that my payment never went through. They also claim that I never made a online order. Gwindes is the owner. I talked to corporate as well as my bank. Both showed my payment processed. Corporate informed me that if this location does not refund me my order, they are in violation. If you want Subway go to the location down the street on Univ/Country Club. This location would not give us our order even though we have proof we paid for it."}
{"text":"This place is a go to for late night food. Always clean and the food is quality. I gave them four stars because the staff could seem a little happier. They are always in a bad mood and it almost makes you feel bad for going in to order food."}
{"text":"UPDATE: They have a Winchell's Donuts in here, so this morning I decided to drop by for a bear claw and a coffee. They were both good, but $4 for that?! That's what I pay at Starbucks for coffee and a scone! I feel Winchell's should be cheaper."}
{"text":"It's a Subway like any other.  It's clean and the food is always good.  The cool thing about this is that it's 24 hours.  Also right now they have deal where you can get a 6 inch Cold Cut Combo or Meatball sub for only $2."}
{"text":"The one star is only because I had to give it at least one in order to rate it at all.

On a recent Monday, I popped in. 

Atrocious is all I can say. Maybe they were just having an off day. I dunno.

There were two young guys sitting out front smoking, along with a female store employee.

The glass front door was covered in smudges. As was the glass that lets one view the fixings.

The counter where the food was prepared was dirty.

The soda fountain area was dirty as well. Stains all about...  The tables and chairs in the place were all disarranged. And the ones I looked at appeared dirty.

The young man making the food did not wash his hands before helping a customer and he didn't change his gloves. Then I saw him wipe his nose on his arm.

The female store employee came inside and went to the back. She appeared at the counter less than a minute later, pulling on gloves. Surely she had no time to wash her hands.

One of the young men she had sat outside with came in about shortly after and proceeded to place his order. She began preparing his sub. I think at that point they became aware I was watching them because they stopped talking and she stopped making his sub. 

I needed to use the restroom but dared not. I was afraid it would be filthiest of all."}
{"text":"Very friendly, clean, and they oil my order right away. For some reason this place is always dead when I'm getting my haircut next door. But overall great service from this subway."}
{"text":"Typical subway service and subway food. It is fast food. It is the usual subway. It was clean and i got my usual vegi on wheat. It tasted like it does at every subway. It is hard to review places like this. Unless there is some abnormal event that happens while you are here, like the manager mooning you or an act of God it is hard to write an interesting review."}
{"text":"Worst subway ever!!! Do not go here dirty person behind counter never changed gloves after touching money. Closes off area of restaurant with a table then screams at you after u move it . DON'T GO HERE!"}
{"text":"When I asked for my order to be non toasted the worker sighed heavily, tsked and made a \"ugh\" sound. Giving it two stars only because the sandwhich was good but customer service i feel what makes or breaks you."}
{"text":"This question is for Subway....  why do your ovens not toast? Warming  & toasting are 2 entirely different & significant things. Quizno's gets this, Subway never has. Putting your food thru their toaster comes out warm..not browned, not crispy...warmed..Huge difference."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a huge fan of Subway but I have to say the cheese omelet on flat bread with some spinach makes for a quick and tasty breakfast.  

You can also 'borrow' Starbucks wifi while your there ;)."}
{"text":"Wish I had read the reviews before I forked over my money.  This was by far the worst airport food I have eaten ANYWHERE. Two bites and it hit the trash. Massively overpriced, lacking flavor, and slow service. A 5-year old running a stand selling lemonade and PB&J sandwiches would have turned out higher quality food. 

In sum, avoid."}
{"text":"This was a convenient Subway for us.  Five minutes from home and good when you needed a quick dinner and didn't want to get out of the car.  That changed the day I got served by two guys I can only describe as \"Lloyd and Harry\".  I sat in the drive-thru of this place for FIFTEEN MINUTES, despite being the only car (at the time) in line.  As a matter of fact, I was the only customer the store had, as I soon found out when I had to go in.  Any other time with any other employees my average wait time had been three to five minutes with larger orders.  I finally received my order, one sub and two kids meals, fifteen minutes after I ordered them, only to find one of the kid sub wrappers coated in some sort of brown liquid that shouldn't have been there.  Already ticked that I had spent fifteen minutes in line for the equivalent of one and a quarter subs, I parked and took the sub in the restaurant.  There I encountered the two \"gentlemen\" who made our food.  When I asked for the sub to be remade, the bleary-eyed teenager looked down at it and asked, \"Why?  What's wrong with it?\"  When I pointed out the brown wrapper he rolled his eyes at me and took the sandwich back, then proceeded to disappear.  ANOTHER TEN MINUTES and one other waiting car in line and they finally came back out and got around to making my three-inch sub.  In the meanwhile the other car pulled around to the parking lot and came in to find out where their food was as well.  They got to stand in the line-up for TWENTY MINUTES, only to find out the two workers were still flummoxed by the issue of remaking my sub.  We were their only two customers, and it took them almost forty minutes to wait on us.  I checked our subs from top to bottom after leaving, fearing the worst, even though I watched them remake the other sub with no incident.  That was about a month ago.  I will NEVER go back, for fear of once again encountering Dumb and Dumber.  It was basically the nail in the Subway coffin for us."}
{"text":"Ok.. So let's start with walking in. There was trash on the floor and I almost turned around. But urged by my husband..we walked in. Out of the bread I wanted, no pepper jack cheese, no olives. And here it is the middle of the day. Seriously.. Your just out like out? Don't you make bread all day? Can't you thaw cheese? And to top it off the cashier threw the receipt at my husband. Not cool. I'll never go back. And I'd love to speak to the manager!"}
{"text":"Love this location staff is super nice only one girl questioned and gave me horrible looks over my sandwich (or maybe that was just her face) ....I order my sandwich with extra jalapenos and banana peppers....I tell them dont stop til u think its gross! Any hoo that girl isnt there any more but i would totally give five stars BUT!!!!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one! its so annoying and as a small business owner im telling you spend the extra two cents because i cant tell you how many times i got home and cursed at my half exposed unsanitary sandwich!~~Im telling you (i use to work at a sandwich shop at 17) it is much easier on everyone with two papers do that i will be five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"this location rocks! everything tasted way fresher than other locations"}
{"text":"Not good. I wasn't greeted and it seemed like her face said \"What do you want.\" The girl was rude and seemed like she hated her job. She put wayyy too much dressing on didn't even ask me when to stop, and put jalepenos in my salad when I didn't ask for that. The salad is so spicy I can bearly eat it. As I was leaving I didn't get a Thank you or have a nice day."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Subway in the Valley. It always very clean, I always get an enthusiastic greeting when I come in, and the sandwiches made here are top notch. Management seems to set the bar high. I have been very impressed with Seth and it's clear that his employees rise to his example. While there is a certain level of expectation for food on the go, it seems that this Subway branch prides  itself in being a step above the rest."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were at the door at 7 pm tonight. There were no customers inside and the worker (a lady) was cleaning up the tables. As soon as she saw us at the door , she looked annoyed and rolled her eyes. Yikes !
We opened the door, but decided to turn around and leave since we were turned off by her unwelcoming attitude. 
Never again will we go back to this place . 
No wonder it gets 2.5 stars on yelp ."}
{"text":"The best thing about this Subway is the friendly staff, they are always cheerful and helpful. They make great sandwiches! I had the tuna six inch with melted cheese on top. Delicious and fast. The only downfall is the location, it's in a strange strip-mall with odd looking characters outside. I guess you could say 'good people-watching'!"}
{"text":"I ordered the daily special $6 footlong. They charged me more than $8 BEFORE TAX. I'll never go back to this location. There are a lot of sandwich shops around town, why would anyone pay extra for a below average tasting sandwich?"}
{"text":"I consider myself as a \"pro\" when it comes to subway, given the fact that I am making peanuts and always on a budget when it comes to food. Used to enjoy the $5-foot long, which is no longer available. Anyway, I don't think I would want to come back to this store any time soon in the near future. The flat bread and the meat tasted very very weird today, compared to the long history of experience I have with Subway. The texture felt different and my hands, from touching the food, smelt very artificial all day. Wanted to puke, which never happened before."}
{"text":"We were looking to grab a quick lunch/dinner on our way from Sedona to LA and decided to stop around Phoenix before heading into the desert. It's in a large shopping plaza and there's tons of parking. It was your typical Subway, but they were friendly and helped us with the 4 sandwiches we ordered very quickly."}
{"text":"The women's bathroom had zero toilet paper, zero paper towels, and zero hand soap. You could tell women were using the toilet seat covers to dry their hands. You can make a great sandwich but if you clearly don't check the bathrooms for cleanliness then I am concerned about your ability to clean the rest of the restaurant. When I told the guy working he blamed it on the morning crew and said he would let them know. Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"I called my order in on phone - 3 footlongs with double meat. It was $32 for these subs and boy did I regret it. First of all there was not double meat and the bread was stale on all - these were the worst subs ever and now after going there for years I wont be back - ever."}
{"text":"Avoid!!  They say they have a drive thru yet I've attempted on several occasions to utilize it, I've either had to honk, drive up to the window and wave to get someone's attention or just leave.  I stand all day at work and prefer to use the drive thru it's very frustrating. I found another one on the corner of Nellis and Lake Mead that actually has a drive thru that works."}
{"text":"They are so cheap with there meat I mean so cheap take so long to make the sub and it's never cheap"}
{"text":"Fast service, clean restaurant, like most Subways I have been to.

$5 foot long is genius marketing and a great deal around the world."}
{"text":"I have visited a bunch of subways. Some are clean, some are dirty, some have the worst customer service. This one is clean, have the right people behind the counter.

I love banana peppers and lettuce I didn't have to ask a bunch of times to get it. They usually just drop a very thin layer of all. 

I can't stand eating at a dirty place. You'd never know how they handle the food, if the place is messy. This subway is clean and the service is great."}
{"text":"It was great when I first walked in, there was no line and there were 2 people helping me. It was perfect! Because I had ordered 2 foot longs, they were quick and fast.  Another customer came in behind me and they seemed to go even faster I was impressed.
I was very nice and sweet to them but for some reason the lady who took care of me at the end of my order had this nasty attitude. 
I asked if she can cut the subs in four and I didn't hear her reply to confirm nor did I see that she cut the subs because she was quick, I asked again if she can cut them in four and she totally snapped and said \"I DID\" as if I was an annoying customer. I was in AWE. 
First of all there was no line. 
Second there was only 1 customer besides myself.
Third, I was nothing but nice to them AND having an awesome day UNTIL she snapped.
I will no longer bring my business to this subway due to this particular expirence as it was my First and now my Last."}
{"text":"Now and then I crave a Subway... For some reason theres another Subway right across the street... Weird! But ok when I walked in the place was emptybut very clean. I have a toddler so I always look for a high chair. Unfortunately I didnt see any available here  so I proceeded to the counter where I wasn't greeted (as I thought was normal) there where was (2) employees talking about other stuff. One proceeded to ask me what I'd like. No friendliness here, I felt very awkward I got my sandwich and left (afterall they have NO highchairs) 
would i come here again? i dont know, I might have to cross the street Lol 

Sandwich was OK nothing outta this world."}
{"text":"Open till 9pm but closed at 8:20pm. 4 hr plan ride an I was hoping for my veggie max , not tonight..."}
{"text":"The service at this subway is outstanding my sandwiches are always the best when you go to a restaurant or a fast food place and you get terrible customer service you always should recognize great customer service subway great customer service and Great food peace"}
{"text":"Just gets worse and worse.  Even less portions and customer service is absolutely rude. The owner must ride these people pretty hard, because it's just complete sadness. Do yourself a favor and drive a couple miles down the road to any other sandwich shop like capriottis, the sandwich spot, or just some other subway."}
{"text":"I was nervous given the previous reviews but it was the closest Subway to our baseball tournament so we decided to give it a try. We were very pleased with our service. We came in with about 12 people and they brought out extra help which kept everything running smooth & efficient. The ladies behind the counter were all very nice as well."}
{"text":"We just walked in and then walked right out! The employee that was working was coughing and sniffing and snorting all over the food!!"}
{"text":"Upon entering subway this evening (12/11/14) there were no workers out front. After hearing the bell ring multiple times from two other guests entering and one leaving, as well as the phone ringing and customers shouting \"hello\" into the back, two unhappy workers emerged from the back with not so much as a hello or a smile. Not only is it ridiculous to wait ten minutes with no one checking to see if a customer has come in, but the customer service skills of the two workers were some of the worst I've ever seen. Not even so much as an apology for the wait? I for sure will not be coming back to this subway ever again."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of subway's. 
And my sandwich is always made in the same fashion.

Bread, meat, cheese, veggies.
And then out the door. 

Let me ask, what is better, a sandwich made by your parent, or when you make it yourself?  
My Answer: my grandmother! 

Why? Love! That's why. The care and compassion that goes into food. Some may say, its just a chain , but no! Its the people that work there that make all the difference."}
{"text":"The location is great , BUT the staff are not kind or helpful much . Rude energy and seemed to be irritated with helping customers ! The only one that was kind or helpful was the younger boy . The two woman were what made my review this way . I was there today and 1:00 pm"}
{"text":"Stale bread, no napkins, no coke and sandwich artist had no clue what was going on. #subwayfail"}
{"text":"Service seems to have gone downhill at this location, as it takes much longer to get your sandwich made these days. There are also some general stocking/restocking issues. For example, today the Diet Coke fountain ran out of syrup so it was just spurting out soda water."}
{"text":"This is the nicest Subway I've eaten in so far. The store is quite spacious with ample, comfortable chairs in addition to your standard tables. The decor is warm and contemporary with TVs on the walls. Service has always been cheerful and friendly."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.
Do yourself a favor, and drive another mile in any direction and find a different Subway.  Employees don't make eye contact (except with each other to roll their eyes when you enter the store)  I am only submitting this review because this is the SECOND time, in the 2 times I've been to this location in the last 30 days that has been like this."}
{"text":"Update: 05/01 For some reason it didn't give me an update button; only edit...so I am adding the new one above: 

Another day and I continue to be dumbfounded by this location. In March I used to order the 6\" breakfast sandwich and drink at the $3 combo price. That promo was not there in April in lieu of the buy one get one free special that this location never seemed to get correct. 

Today is May and I ordered my standard 6\" flatbread bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. As I progressed down the line I noticed the $3 combo sign was back up. In every other Subway location when checking out they ask if you want a combo, and if you say yes they push combo, and the register gives the combo price. After seeing the sign that says 6\" sandwich and 21 oz drink $3, I removed a 21oz cup. The lady rang it up and said $5.50. I asked how do I get the combo? She said oh, you have to tell me that. Then frustrated she hit several buttons until it reflected the price. Shouldn't the combo be a standard item? All other times they ask if the customer wants a combo. If the combo is a sandwich and a medium drink and a customer orders and sandwich then takes a medium cup, shouldn't that be a clue? Either way, I think this location needs some additional training. 



04/30/12: There seems to be confusion on the April promo of buy one get one free. It says get a free 6\" sandwich when you buy any 6\" sandwich before 9. My first attempt I ordered the sandwich and nothing was mentioned. I came back for lunch and asked how it worked. The lady said the customer has to tell them in the morning, they enter a code, and it prints on the receipt. No free one that day. 

I went back again to the same location and upon ordering my breakfast sandwich I asked about the free one. She said I could get it now. I don't want it now. I want it at lunch. I don't want it sitting on my desk attracting germs nor do I want to re-heat it to kill said germs. After saying I didn't want it now, she said okay. It wasn't entered and actually I didn't even get a receipt :-/

The product line is the same as every Subway. The challenge is the shop is small with limited seating and fills up quickly at lunch."}
{"text":"WARNING! WORST. CUSTOMER. SERVICE. i usually don't like to write negative reviews or complain but wow. i usually go to the Decatur and Ann Rd location but this subway was a bit closer to my house so i gave it a shot. i didn't get greeted when i walked in, keep in mind it's just myself, 1 other person and two employees. i was rushed the whole entire time. every time i said each veggie individually she told me \"that's it\". AND she was throwing the veggies on there, didn't keep her space clean. at least at the Decatur and Ann Rd location they carefully place each veggie and make sure there's a decent amount on there and not half ass it. even placed the meat like in a \"whatever i don't care\" way. i really disliked her customer service and i would call to speak to a manager but i bet they can care less. do not come here."}
{"text":"Service sucks, let me tell you why. I am vegan. I asked for a foot long with my bread toasted. The guy at the counter asked whether or not I wanted meat or cheese, I said no. The guy then turns to his female co-worker and starts laughing at me and says \" toast that sounds good\". They are sitting here snickering right in front of me. So rude. No you morons I am not going to order just toast... I proceeded to get vegetables, avocados, etc. Was extremely disappointed, as most places are kind and dont laugh about what I am eating."}
{"text":"The food is the same as every other subway so not much to report there.  The service is what differs from one location to another.  This one is hit and miss.  Some days the staff are upbeat and friendly, some days you know they're this close to spitting in your food.  Your call."}
{"text":"The chicken tastes blandfully artificial, but what should one expect from Subway anyway?"}
{"text":"Counter girls are like steel robuts and only give forks out if a salad is bought.  They scrutinize every portion of food! Never again...."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! my 10 year old asked me if we could eat somewhere else. They tried to make me a salad in a dirty bowl!  
I had to speak up and she said it's the only bowl they have. Really?! Nasty! 
Such Lazy employees, sitting around watching one employee make all the food. Ugh. 
I had to to return my sons turkey sandwiches because the meat tasted rotten. The manager took a bite and agreed that it was rancid and said she would throw the whole package out. Good lord! Never ever again."}
{"text":"My husband and I walk in and the two employees are in a heated discussion with cussing and dropping f bombs. They are angry and saying 'yeah, that's why we don't fucking serve them!' We stand there wondering if it's us they are talking about because they carried on and never made eye contact with us (we are white). 

Finally she looks at us and says she's racist but doesn't have a problem with us but she hates fucking Indians. 

Umm excuse me what? We just wanted a sandwich. No one else was in there they were just carrying on about how they hate 'those fucking people'. I did not catch her name because she was so heated she stormed off, the young man's name I did catch- Trey. 

Very uncomfortable, hurtful, disrespectful, shameful. As I sit in the food court I look around and see people from all over the world and love the diversity. I hope these two subway employees keep their strong opinions to themselves in the future"}
{"text":"The manager that works there currently is a total creep. I don't want to go in anymore because of the unnecessary attention he gives every single female that walks in the door. He asked to clear my trash from my table after I was finished eating and refill my drink, and insisted on making conversation with me, when all I want to do was eat and read. He then persisted to walk straight past two construction worker guys, who were also finished, and he completely ignored them. They were laughing their butts off. Also, he insists on making my sandwich as fast as he can, and then skipping every other customer in front of me who are having their sandwiches made, to ring me up before them. Leave people alone when they eat!"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood subway so we come here almost on a daily right after the gym. Located in a plaza right by our home.

We come in and see the same artist everyday, Bryant. He's a great kid, remembers our order each time and is always smiling. 

Place is never too busy. Quick service and food always taste fresh.

Also, this location is 24 hours which I rarely see for a subway and for a subway in a neighborhood plaza, just a weird side note lol."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'll start by saying, this has more to do with the appearance and esthetic over the food quality,  but I still think it's worth at least addressing so it can hopefully be improved, so bear with me....I just stopped in for a to-go order, and while the staff was polite and restaurant seemed clean enough, the employee who made my sandwich was just a little but too much of a mess for me. Their shirt was messy, had more than one hole and was stained, apron the same and while I get that stuff happens. It was past the point of an oops. Watching the person lean over my sub and nearly brush it with their dirty shirt was yucky for me and left me feeling grossed out. As a person who works in the service industry I think it's important to look put together for customers. I don't want this to come across mean or belittling, I just think it's something that should be taken into consideration for future. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is the worst subway I've been to. My expectations can only be so high when it comes to subway, but this location was a joke. I ordered a pizza...I didn't realize I needed to specify whether I wanted it hot or frozen. I went to take a bite and the center was not just slightly cold, but icy. There were a few other people in line at that point. Rather than calling for help from his coworker in the back, he had me wait until the line was through to help me. When he brought the pizza back, it was burned to a crisp. I'm not one to complain so I attempted to eat it anyway, that's when I realized the parchment paper they use to cook it on had baked to the bottom."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Employees should be helping each other instead of hanging out outside.  They didn't have a full stock of toppings or bread let alone any soups why be open 24hrs. If your not prepared to deliver.  They should hire people who actually care about their job what ever it may be. Definitely not satisfied or coming back."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the quality of this sandwich. Ample veggies, delicious chicken and bacon, nicely toasted bread. Awesome. Loved how the employees wore their Cavs gear, supporting the local team. I would for sure eat here again."}
{"text":"Our server was super super nice! The portions were great. Didn't have a single problem with customer service or the food. Ordered the $3.50 sub of the day, the Tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"This is a good Subway. The staff was friendly and the place was clean. The manager of shift even offered a free sample of a cookie for my son."}
{"text":"They make sandwiches. They taste good.

It's Subway, folks. What more do I need to say? In the immortal words of George Oscar Bluth, \"Like the guy in the $6000 suit is gonna take the time to critique a Subway... COME ON!\""}
{"text":"It's Subway! If you like Subway, this place is just as good as any other location. If you don't, I doubt anything I say would sway you. As for me, I'm all for supporting these businesses near my house. Although I don't eat Subway often, I appreciate having this location available to me within a 3-minute walk."}
{"text":"This Subway doesn't have the greatest staff, but I wasn't expecting perfection, just a little politeness at least.  Didn't even get that on this trip.  Gal who was originally going to make my subs gave me a \"wow, I don't want to help you now\" look when I informed her I wanted 4 sub sandwiches.  Very rude if you ask me....  Then pops up another gal who was much more pleasant and made sure she got all of my orders correct.  So that was nice.  Then you get to the condiments person and, again, a douche bag..... he was also running the cash register, (which slowed up the process and wait time) while a buddy of his stood on the side and continually distracted him from doing his job.  

Not one of my greatest visits here.

We do like subway when needing something light, so I try to overlook the staff when I go in, otherwise I would never come here."}
{"text":"Since when does subway charge a BAG fee? THANKS MADISON. Ya 5 cents. Next time ask your customers if they want a bag if your going to charge for it. Sneaky a$$ people."}
{"text":"I don't know what they do to this subway's bread that they don't do anywhere else, but dang that bread was so soft.  I loved it!  

Now I don't know when they decided to use the mini scoops, but really?!  Subway makes bank and they can't give the customer what they want anymore?  My sister worked at Subway for 15 years and she was the best sandwich artist ever!  She made a sandwich how you wanted it, not by Subway law.  

The customer service was good.

I will go back for that tasty bread.  Mmmmm"}
{"text":"I went in to buy a gift certificate. I was helped by a very disinterested kid.  He let me know that they are called gift cards.  I was not given the $5 coupon for buying a $25 gift card.    This is not the only rude Subway in Vegas.  The prices for the food is good,  but the service is awful."}
{"text":"This is good for a subway.  The food is good and the employees can be very nice & patient.  Not all of the rolls are good @ subway.  Find what you like & stick with it."}
{"text":"Basically it's Subway.  Service is so so, sometimes it's good but usually it's mediocre at best.  It seems when ever they get a few people they get a little freaked and hurried which seems to make it all go slower.  I'm a veggie sub fan myself and they always skimp on the veggies so I have to ask for extras.  Just assume double if it's a veggie sub people!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want to listen to Jared and get sometimes cheap, healthy, and kind of delicious. And for me when these times come a calling subway is a good option. But I have to say this is by far the worst subway I have ever been to.

One, they don't participate in ANY of the subway promotions. There are no subs of the day. And there are no five dollar subs either. Don't even bother asking if they have ANY deals. Two, the subs that they do make are haphazardly put together... like most subways, but I think this place takes the cake. 

When it comes down to it, it's still a cheap meal. But there are a lot of other subways out there. I go to the one down at Queens Quay and York instead of this one even though it's a little farther for me, but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Not open for business when hours state 7am... FAIL I should have checked the reviews beforehand. \"Our system is booting\" is NOT an excuse... I hope the management and owner improve this situation because it seems normal here."}
{"text":"Amazing employees, great and relaxing atmosphere, and delicious food make this subway stand out for sure! I've come to this subway for the last nine months when I'd get off work..Always fabulous food and service!!! Great subway!"}
{"text":"After doing orientation for my new job at khols, I grabbed a bite to eat here at subway!!!! The sandwich was delicious and the workers were so nice!! Shout out to Tracie for being super sweet!!! Love subway for life!"}
{"text":"Hi everyone!!! I used to work at this store and it hurts me when I see negative reviews about it! At times, it does get busy and quality control may fall a little short but that happens to all of us! The manager of the store, Daniel, was always particular about how the store looked and was nice to customers. He's a very hard worker and deserves much better than he receives. I always love every customer I meet and working at this store was one of the best experiences of my life. So..I highly suggest this clean, friendly store."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times!!!
Service and staff has always been good to me.  Lots of seating, gets busy during prime hours. Lots of parking. Whenever i order a footlong and ask them to individually wrap the two halves, they never gave me a problem. This store is combined with a donut/coffee side."}
{"text":"I didn't feel like cooking and didn't feel like making an effort to look half decent to go to a restaurant in the plateau so I decided to pass by the closest Subways to my place. I have no complaints. The person that served myself and my boyfriend was extremely pleasant, huge smile, very polite. Not to mention my sandwich was awesome!"}
{"text":"I have had a craving for a sandwich as of recent. The only solution I knew was to go to subway. Didn't love the sandwich artist today though.

I got the \"Montreal smoked meat\" on honey oat today. I'm not sure how asking for \"swiss cheese\" accounts for asking for \"extra cheese\" but occasionally the cashiers will be told by the sandwich artist to get it rang in as such. I tried asking for the reason today, and she simply glared at me and walked away. 

The sandwich came out very full today, stuffed full of veggies which I loved. The sandwich artists at this location are always willing to add extra veggies when asked.

I do have some concerns in regards to their glove use though. After making my sandwich, I watched the sandwich artist use the same pair of gloves to clean up the prep area, get lettuce from the back, load up the fridge and proceed to serve the next customer. I would highly suggest you to request the sandwich artist to change her gloves before making your sandwich if you're concerned. 

Overall, not too bad of an experience, quick service and easy to find a parking spot outside."}
{"text":"Show up after working tonight,  Which my brother says this location is awesome. As soon as we walk in the guy, armondo; tells us that the option to use the toaster is unavailable. I ask why. He says because he likes to clean it at night. Ummmm... What? It's a 24 hour subway.. I def come here for a toasted sub. But I can't have one bc you like to clean the toaster at night? Whack. Don't come here. Thanks \"armondo\" btw 400 degrees in my oven for 20 secs doesn't work you jackass. Cheers."}
{"text":"I had such a long day today that by the time school ended, I was soooo hungry, I could eat a UNICORN! 

After what seemed like an hour's worth of bus rides (and sure enough, it took me that long to get to the Fashion Show Mall from CSN west charleston campus) my galpal and I opted to meet at the food court. There, I ordered a 6\" tuna sandwich - with herbs and cheese bread, cheddar (toasted), tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, sweet onion sauce - for $5 + tax. I guess it's safe to say that the sandwich was gone in less than 10 minutes. The vegetables were fresh and I loved how subway's tuna isn't oozing with mayonnaise. 

We then returned after our meal to get ourselves some cookies. For 75cents, you could get 1 but for $2, you could get yourself 3. Being the sweet-tooth that we are, we ordered 2 Chocolate Chip cookies and 1 White Chocolate and Macademia cookie. When we ordered our desserts, it was already about 6:20pm so sadly, there weren't anymore Raspberry Cheesecake Cookies - my ultimate favourite! So if you ever head to Subway, you can now keep in mind that they're not merely limited to just sandwiches. 

There's no doubt subway'll always be my preferred go-to over McDonalds - healthier and more stuffing between the bread...and they've got a 'sweet'er side to them too!"}
{"text":"The employees are really nice, the store is very clean, they made my sandwich just like I asked. I'll be back. =)"}
{"text":"An average Subway restaurant, the people were nice and quick.  Smells like wonderful fresh baked bread and the facility was clean."}
{"text":"So this has to be the cleanest, fastest, most polite, super friendly, best smelling, best prepared sandwich ever at a Subway. I am a subway fan but I am never blown away by the service or the facility, this location is hidden away but it is definitely the location I prefer."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER WITH POST MATES. I am not allowed to leave my station so I tried to order. It only let me pick one topping and wouldn't let me specify in notes. I received onion and cheese on two slices of bread. I wanted cucumbers, lettuce, cheese, tomato, red onion, and olives. You can't call because the workers hang up or don't answer."}
{"text":"I came here a few times since it is on my way home.  The last time I went there the owner and his wife were there and they were very friendly. He even helped out his staff so we got our order quickly. The food is well prepared and we got exactly what we asked for. The fountain drink machine lets you customize the drink you want. Will return."}
{"text":"Very friendly and quick lady at the counter.  It was a quiet location on a Saturday night, but is probably busier during the week because of offices nearby. The other customers that came in all had take out, we were the only ones that ate in."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant that is warm ( some places are cold in winter). The guy behind the counter preparing the subs was very friendly and quick. I won't comment on the food since it is the same as other Subways (was happy no complains). They did have a sign at the pop machine that said \"drink refills 25 cents\"."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the 102 sanitation score. Staff was friendly and prepared my sandwich with a smile. Would have given it 5 stars but the parking isn't the best."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the work week. The Girl that was making my sandwich behind the counter was nice and pretty speedy.

I ordered a salad and asked for all spinach. I like the way they mix the salad and break it up into small pieces. The lady that was making my salad was generous with the toppings as well and I appreciate it when I don't have to ask for more. The salad was really yummy and I was surprised at how much I liked it b/c the last time I had a salad from Subway was years ago and it wasn't nearly as tasty. That could very well have been my fault, but irregardless, I'll be back for a healthy lunch on the go.

I do wish they had some patio seating here, but Panda Express is 2 doors down and they have a large outside eating area out front if you care to venture outdoors."}
{"text":"I go to this Subway numerous times a week since it's walking distance from my house. It's either really great, or really bad whenever I go here dependent on who is making my sandwich. 

One guy who makes the sandwiches (he's the only guy I've ever seen working the counter) is amazing. He spaces out your toppings, he's generous with the amount, and he listens to particular requests (i.e. a TINY bit of light mayo doesn't go unheard). 

On the other hand, there is a woman who works behind the counter (she's the oldest I've seen working there) and she is more than awful. Not only does she act like you are pissing her off, but she puts your toppings either entirely on one half of your sandwich - which is difficult for a 6\" - or she puts hardly anything on your sandwich at all and when you ask for more, she grabs one or 2. On top of that, she never cuts your sandwich so when you get home you end up tearing it apart and everything falls out anyway.

It's not just me either, when my friends go there, the same thing happens to them, so I know it's her and she just isn't really that great at making the sandwiches. When I go back, I just get bummed when it's her that makes my sandwich and I'll deal with her angry sandwich-making ways until the next time."}
{"text":"Basic sandwich shop. Clean and modern. Yes, it's a fast food joint. That's where teenagers work. Get over it. My kids love their sandwiches and are always very kind to the kids when they are choosing the sandwich toppings."}
{"text":"Great service even if its 3:30 Am. I was not going to Jack, Or MC 'dees. I wanted to eat a snack. Very clean, very friendly! 

OPEN 24hrs!

Worth the drive or Cab!"}
{"text":"Jasmine has no customer service skills whatsoever. She finished with customer in front of me. Walks to where I am waiting to order, puts on plastic gloves, and just looks at me. No smile. No greeting. Nothing. So after we stare at each other, I finally ask her if she's ready. She nods and proceeds to make my order. I asked for bacon and cheese, which usually gets put on before veggies, but she does the opposite. Ok. After I pay for my order, I inform her there are no lids that fit my cup. She tells me there should be some out there. I wait for someone to bring the small lids out. At some point, she must've handed some to the customer behind me and had them put them out for her, unbeknownst to me. I'm standing there for what seems like forever, never acknowledged by any employees, and I realize there are small lids in bin that had not been there prior. I left and have no plans to return. Do yourself a favor and take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got the rotisserie chicken for the first time and last bite had a bone. Considering how chopped up the meat is and how little meat you get, how would you miss that thing when prepping? I called the store to let them know, the guy couldn't answer any questions and didn't want to tell me the managers name, except I saw her leave from the back door when I left and I said is it the short woman that just left for the day, he said yeah, and I asked again what her name was, he said Nicole, omg it was like talking to Forrest Gump. The bone piece is a good inch long and curved. I say skip this sandwich. I won't even talk about the messed up service with 2 guys playing musical sandwich maker and toasting my 6\" and letting it sit while they prepped the other lady's 3 foot longs and she's like well what kind of sauce do you suggest....shoot me"}
{"text":"It's a fairly standard Subway. Nothing really all that special, but the staff is generally very nice. The parking is decent but it's not the biggest lot."}
{"text":"Normally I feel nothing special about Subway. However, after a grueling long shift at work followed by errands and an appetite, I suddenly feel something special about Subway. 

     This Subway, which sits in the Smith's-anchored Pebble Marketplace that is conveniently located off Green Valley Parkway between the 215 and Pebble Road; has been serving me subs since I moved here in 2004. Keep in mind that Las Vegas didn't always have Firehouse, Jimmy John's, and many of the popular lunch spots. In recent times, after work I'd give in to my appetite and step into this Subway to take advantage of their reasonable promotions. 

     Currently Subway has the daily $3 Sub of the Day promotion.The way it works is that there is a different $3 six inch sub for each day of the week. For example on Sunday I can pick up a six inch meatball marinara for $3. On another day I could pick up a six inch tuna sub. When I add a 21 ounce beverage, it comes out to around $5. 

    The employees or sub artists are friendly. Upon walking inside they welcome me and prepare the sub. They even asked how my meal was. How was my meal? 

   In my opinion, Subway trails behind the rising sub superstars including Firehouse in quality and atmosphere. However, Subway is around half the price of Firehouse. With that said, I had little negative feelings toward Subway when the meatball marinara bread fell apart and I was striving to prevent getting the sauce and ingredients all over my hand. And I had little negative feelings toward Subway when the sandwich seemed to include very little real estate for the meatballs. Because the bread breaks easy and the sauce and ingredients get all over my hands causing my version of Dirty Dining, I prefer Subway's cold cut subs such as the Italian BMT in one of the two pictures below. 

   Where the meatballs in the meatball marinara have insufficient real estate, this Subway restaurant has prime real estate. It shares a parking lot with several businesses including Smith's, Starbuck's, Popcorn Girl, Bank of America, Great Clips, Triple A, and a Verizon store. Additionally it sits off the Green Valley Parkway exit of the 215. For many people, including yours truly it is a quick and convenient lunch. 

   Subway is doing the right thing with the $3. When my appetite is acting up in Pebble Marketplace, I will most likely do the right thing by supporting Subway."}
{"text":"Subway must be doing something right. They are constantly opening new restaurants. What their new Galleria Mall restaurant does right is serve Subway favorites with generous amount of meat at prices that do not take advantage of the Galleria customers."}
{"text":"These days Subway is my first and last meal of the day. Lately in the busy days of December when I put in a substantial amount of hours at work, by the time I clock out I am totally exhausted and not in the mood to eat out or cook dinner. It appears that I am just in the mood for Subway.

One of the things that I appreciate about Subway is that I can pick up my sub at 2 pm then when I get home place it in the fridge and a couple of hours later before I go to bed ahead of another long day at work that sub tastes as good as when the sub artist prepared it.

During the most recent workathons I can write that I am on a Subway diet. The diet consists of a foot long black forest ham and a Miller Genuine Draft before falling asleep listening to a podcast. My Subway diet is inexpensive and filling. The foot long black forest ham is a good deal. At $6.22 after tax it is approximately the same price as a rostere chicken at Smith's or a couple dollars more than a frozen dinner. This is far more than black forest ham between two pieces of multi grain bread. In a sense, my Subway diet isn't truly a diet because I load up the sub with pepper jack cheese, olives, jalapeños, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, peppers, light mayonnaise, oil, mustard, black pepper and other delectable ingredients.

 This very Subway sits in a small strip mall at the northwest corner of Pecos Road and Patrick Street by a Home Depot. This is one of a few Subways with a drive-thru. If I am not mistaken it was formerly Java Detour. I never used the drive-thru, however, my friend told me that when she used it it took 15 minutes to make the sandwich and they messed up the sandwich. On the contrary, as I will state later, I had positive experiences ordering my sub to go inside. 

  In my opinion, the one flaw is entering and leaving the parking lot from eastbound Patrick Street. The flaw is that if you want to turn left into the parking lot, there is a concrete median divider before the entrance. If somebody is a reckless driver, unfortunately they will drive on the wrong side of Patrick Street to enter the parking lot. The correct way to enter the parking lot from eastbound Patrick Street is to turn left onto Sagebrush Street then turn right and continue across a parking lot. Once near Subway there is sufficient parking.

  When I visited this Subway the kids working here have been fast and friendly. They made my black forest ham sub the way I like it. And they made it fast without skipping on the ingredients.

During my most recent workathons that can leave me exhausted, the Subway diet works for me. This is a convenient Subway to sustain that diet."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's the little things that mean a lot. Take for instance, a Subway 6-inch. When I am in the mood for food to carry me over for a few hours, a 6-inch Subway sub does the job. 

   Lately Subway is a fantastic value. This is the era of the daily $3 6-inch Sub of the Day. Corresponding to each day of the week there is a feature sub for $3. With a 21 ounce drink it comes out to around $5.20. 

  This is the closest Subway to my residence. Over the years that date back prior to the birth of my Yelp profile I have caught this Subway's act.  It is more than the subs that I enjoyed. It was also their fountain Strawberry Fanta. Before the Coke Freestyle machines were around this was one of the few restaurants in my neighborhood that offered strawberry Fanta. Throughout the years my experiences here were three stars. The common denominators in my experiences were one or two people working in the restaurant and consistency in good subs. 

   In recent times during the Daily $3 Sub of the Day Era, my experiences here continue to be three stars. My most recent subs were the meatball marinara and tuna. They are so clear in my conscious that I could talk about the past two visits in more detail. 

   Before I even describe my recent experiences inside this Subway, there are a few words about outside. The shopping center it sits in is poorly laid out. The Subway parking spaces are in a poor location where vehicles back up to the traffic signal at Green Valley Parkway causing the parking spaces to be blocked on. I always park further away by Green Valley Grocery or Bank of America to avoid being blocked in. 

   Inside Subway there are plenty of tables. Finding a table has never been a problem. Fast service on the other hand is a slight problem. 

  There has been one or two people running this Subway. Today there was genuinely one person running it because the woman doing all the work was training the new guy. The upshot is that during peak periods the woman running the business still has two hands. When she is both sandwich artist and cashier, speed slows to a crawl. What could you do? If there were three people working here, I doubt they would see $3 6-inch Sub of the Days. These employees have always been pleasant and hard working. 

    Today I ordered the tuna fish sub on Italian bread. I requested that the sandwich artist toast it in the microwave. As a sandwich artist, she did not hold back on the toppings. I requested every topping with the exception of pickles and banana peppers plus extra mayonnaise. For a quarter more than you'd pay for a cup of coffee nearby at Mothership Coffee, this sub was $3 well spent. Going back a few weeks prior I ordered the meatball marinara. This meatball marinara was similar to the one I recently ate in the Pebble Marketplace Subway, where the bread crumbled causing the meatball to fall out and consequently turning into my version of dirty dining where sauce gets all over my hands. Besides that it was a tasty sub with a sporadic serving of meatballs sharing the Italian bread with provolone cheese, onions, olives, and tomatoes. 

   The $3 Sub of the Day Deal really fits the catchphrase of Subway making it your way. When I am in the vicinity of Green Valley Parkway at Subway Road and want something to fill me over for a few hours, this Subway hits the spot."}
{"text":"Review on Fiesta Subway:

  No way I was paying $21 to eat in the Fiesta for a New Years buffet. So, when I saw they doubled their price, I walked downstairs to their food court to try Subway.
   Disparate from many Subways in casinos (especially on the Strip), the prices here are identical to neighborhood Subways. And, lately Subway is running a $5 six-foot meal deal. A value that has increased my Subway check ins.
  The service was fast and friendly. 
  Inside the Fiesta, it has a prime location. A few steps away is Regal Cinemas, Starbucks, and rows of slot machines.
  My rating is 4 stars. I am a fan."}
{"text":"\"If the $5 featured pizza sub special starts in May, why is the sign posted on the door in April?\" That is the question I am asking after spending $12 on it.

   The store is clean. That's good and all. But they should pay enough attention to the customer as wiping the counter.

   What about the featured sub they will be promoting in May? Very sloppy. Two napkins are insufficient.

  Lesson learned. I will pay closer attention to advertisement signs at businesses. Even at fast food places."}
{"text":"4 Stars for Subway?

Oh hell yeah! With the foot long Meatball Marinara, Italian, or Black Forest Ham subs currently going for $4.99, I am a fan. This costs less money than buying frozen processed dinners from the supermarket.

While the $4.99 promotion is taking place, I have been frequently taking out the $4.99 Subway Black Forest Ham sub in lieu of buying frozen processed dinners from the supermarket. If it were not for the fact that most of the Subways near my work and home are in parking lots that are a nuisance to navigate, I have also bought the frozen processed supermarket food on the days that I normally do not eat out. What separates this Subway from most of the locations by my work and home is the simplicity of navigating the parking lot which is to the northeast of Interstate 215 and Valle Verde Drive. First off exiting the parking lot is a breeze. There are two sets of traffic signals off Valle Verde Drive by Subway that stop and slow down the cross traffic. This includes the set of traffic lights at Interstate 215 and the Kohl's Shopping Center attached to the Subway parking lot. This has eliminated the nuisance of existing. Second off, it is equally a breeze parking. It is in a pad with a only a few businesses that don't draw crowds at the same time it is close to Valle Verde Drive. This eliminates navigating through a shopping center. 

  The times  that I stopped by this Subway were when I was in the vicinity of Cornerstone Park or driving home from east Henderson or Boulder City. They were oftentimes on the days that I normally eat out but wanted to eat in my home. A nice thing about Subway is that I can pick up two days worth of Black Forest Ham subs and store them in the refrigerator to get me through the following evening. 

   Everytime that I stopped by this Subway the employees have been fast and professional. And the Black Forest Ham sub has been just the way I ordered: toasted multigrain bread, pepper jack cheese, every topping excluding pickles and banana peppers, topped off with oil, vinegar, mustard, light mayonnaise, and Black pepper.

  With the outstanding $4.99 deal, I am a fan of Subway. After the promotion ends and the Black Forest Ham goes back to $6 and change, I will continue to patronize the chain. Perhaps less frequently. Additionally with the ease of navigating the parking lot, I am also a fan of this location."}
{"text":"I come to this place often because it's right down the road from my house. It's also 24 hours and there's never a line. I usually go for the late night munchies. It's always the same young kid. Pretty cool guy. I would recommend the place."}
{"text":"This place is 24hours but you got to go threw the drive thru. The lady there was scared when we knocked on the door. She had a black eye. Looked as if she was robbed or something. She told us we had to order through the drive up window. It's a subway so no big deal. Customer service ended up being ok. I would come back if I don't feel like getting down."}
{"text":"Staff was rude as well as the owner. He even rolled his eyes at a specific request. Will never patron this subway again!"}
{"text":"Bought Subway gift cards from this location. Person working apparently didn't know how to ring up cards and gave me inactive cards. Went back to the manager and informed them of the problem and instead of trying to fix the issue, claimed they weren't purchased there. My receipt said otherwise. Refused to refund my money or fix the cards. Thank god for Citi, reimbursed my card account due to FRAUD. Thanks Citi. Subway, you suck."}
{"text":"Subway is as Subway does and this location Subways very well. I've been here a few times and always got different sandwiches. In my experience the meats are good quality - no funny colors, tastes, or odors; an abundance of cheeses, three white plus yellow american, all soft; the toppings have good color, texture, and taste; plus the breads are soft and fresh. Beverage thinger has liquid sugars by PepsiCo and some vitamin water stuff that lets me tell myself I'm choosing wisely.
Not sure what all the hubbub is for, it's a pretty good Subway. Health Dept says it has a good beat, easy to dance to! gave it a 98.0! Yea for lunch!"}
{"text":"Walked in and wasn't greeted just told they were out of almost all their variety's of bread. The two employees working were fast but it was just me and one other customer in the store. Not worth the price for the quality of meat you get. Would much rather go to Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"The only reason why I go to this Subway is because of a man named Tom, that works there in the mornings. He is sooo professional, extra helpful, and he's so patient when my daughter is ordering!  I wish all employees were like him. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Starting the the assumption that Subway is a healthy-ish fast food option and nothing more, I wanted to review this location, in particular. My Subway of choice is the location in Robarts Library on the University of Toronto campus. The staff there are nice, the bread is fresh, and the cheese is relatively plentiful. None of those are true of this location. The amount of grated cheddar they give you here is maybe 1/3 of what you'd get at Robarts Subway. Also, I saw the guy at the till, presumably the owner, not ring in purchases. People aware of how things work with some small businesses will understand that this means he is not paying all the taxes he should. 

The upstairs area is too hot. You'd think that the windows would ameliorate the situation. They do not because they are screwed shut. 

Never coming back to this location if I can help it. If you don't mind the students (and Aramark, I'm presuming), go to the Robarts location. Folks there are very friendly and would be happy to take your order."}
{"text":"In fact, I rather like the staff here. I say hello to them every time, and they smile and say hello back. I'm a person who asks for a lot of lettuce or whatever, and I've never had a problem getting that here. 

Apparently, it's a union shop here, which is nice. (Go unions!) Apparently, it means they can give you more cheese than the average Subway?

Real good for a Subway. Unfortunately, I eat here more than I'd like to."}
{"text":"While we were greeted as we walked in we were ignored completely after that. The two behind the counter were speaking in Spanish and, yes, they were preparing food, but there were no physical customers there in front of us. After several minutes of the female employee not even looking at us, and her acknowledgement of the Spanish people that came in after us, we walked out. Oh by the way I'm Hispanic and my husband is Native American. Will never go here again!"}
{"text":"I work close by so this is a very convenient location. However, as time passes I've seen new employees come through each month. I've never had an issue with any of my food up until now. This new staff they have this month didn't not meet my expectations. The bread was not up to it's usually standards either. And it's really hard to mess up a sandwich let alone the bread. I was disgusted with the quality of the food the last time I went. 
So I think I'll skip this location for the next couple of months and hope a brand new better staff comes along."}
{"text":"This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient subways I have EVER been to.  I've only been in the evenings, but I have to say every time I walk in, someone is always cleaning something.  Their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins.  Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck. Thats what makes this Subway so great. Everything is in it's place, and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work.  Absolutely I will go here again, and I can't say that about many Subways unfortunately."}
{"text":"This store has always had a good sandwich, however today I got a bread sandwich.   I can actually count the bell peppers (5)
Onions (2) very thin slices. 
Steak, well it's hidden behind cheese and it really  doesn't cover the entire 6in sub its in the center only. This is why I'm calling it a bread sandwich."}
{"text":"Walked in right when they were about to go on break. They took care of my request with no issue. Since it was slow and no one was behind me, I asked a million questions about different subs that were not on the menu, they offered their expertise on what they have created and what tasted good and what did not. They were great guys who put up with my questions on attempting to order the best sub I have ever had....since it was not on menu it was my own creation. 
So to finish off, best sub ever. The sub artist helped me and my crazy thoughts put together a bad a$$ sandwich.
Props to Jake and Mason for making this a great subway experience!!! Will come back here."}
{"text":"The staff is super helpful and always in the mood to assist and serve. The brightest employee would be Chrystee who makes each and every customer feel more than welcomed."}
{"text":"The food tastes good as Subway always does. However the service here leaves much to be desired and I'm sorely disappointed. I frequent Subways often as its one of my favorite foods. This is my first time at this location and I've never experienced such poor customer service at any other location. The girl serving my family and I is not wearing a name badge so I don't know her name. However she is young and possibly of latino decent. She's tall and has long dark curly hair pulled uo in the front with a barret on top and the rest pulled back into a point tail. She has a deep raspy voice. Hope that helps in identifying her. We are here now and it is 4:30pm on Sunday.

Anyway, when we first arrived we had to wait to place our order while she was talking and laughing with the customer before us. He was already done checking out and just standing there joking around with her. She didn't even acknowledge that we were standing there (four of us). She eventually sauntered over and as she asked us for our orders she never made eye contact and had an attitude of annoyance. My whole family noticed it and we were all really bothered by her acting like we were putting her out. She never once smiled or made us feel welcome. 

We are eating in so we've witnessed her being a lot more friendly with the young guys coming in. And now we are leaving in which she isn't acknowledging or saying thank you or good bye, nothing.

Over all an uncomfortable and annoying experience. I doubt I'll go into that location again even though I'll be in that area often now. It's unfortunate for me as a consumer and for you as a business. 

By the way, this is the first bad review I've ever written as I don't believe in writing bad ones unless absolutely necessary. My hopes are that the management does something about this so future patrons don't experience the same thing."}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars because of Aliceson's customer service. I just stopped by after work to grab something to eat and she was very friendly, great attitude. I like a lot of green peppers on my sandwich and I feel like most of the time I don't get enough, even when I say \"extra\" and she put plenty :) thank you Aliceson!"}
{"text":"Love the staff and the energy. They always give off a good vibe and give suggestions when i dont know what i want. Very healthy environment and i love the food. 10/10"}
{"text":"Merissa made our party sub today and it turned out perfect! It was just what we asked for. Everyone loved it! She communicated with us about when to pick it up, pricing every step of the way and being a business owner and mother of a toddler, I appreciated that. We got all the condiments we asked for as well. Bread was perfect. Could not be happier!"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS. I don't want anything to do with Subway due to issues I have had with a North Carolina location as well as Corporate.

My girlfriend was hungry late at night and Subway sounded good to her..for whatever reason. I looked up this location on the Corporate website and it said they were open until 11. I tried to place an order online and it wasn't working so I just decided to drive around the corner.

Would you look at that. It was 10:30 and they weren't open! Sounds about right, given my previous run-ins with Subway.

Now, isn't it interesting the website now lists this location as closing at 9:30. 

Subway is not the way."}
{"text":"WOW! That's the only word that comes to mind when I think of this extravagant food institution they call subway!! I had the fastest customer service here and Amber was a huge help. My son wanted his tuna warmed up on the side and she did it without complaining and with a smile:) I will definitely be back here in the future!!"}
{"text":"I was there this past Sunday 10/21/12 late evening, and the service i received was the worst. I never received service like this at any food place i've been to. The associate (Nora) was rude and there was no manager on duty to take of the situation."}
{"text":"Very inefficient operation. They have 3 guys and 1 is just in the back pretending to be working when in fact there is a long line of people waiting. Takes 30 mins just to order a bite. Well food is the same as any subway."}
{"text":"This subway is NASTY. The bread was gross. Super stale. The veggies were old. The avocado is hard and yucky. The meat has no flavor. I have no clue why this place isn't like the other Subways I've been to but it's not good. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"I often go to the subway with my children. Every time I eat there I get stomach issues. They are mishandling of their meats or something is just not right with the food. I am not going here again. I don't have this issue with other subway locations."}
{"text":"Not much notable about this particular location except that it is really, really difficult to get in.  You can see it easily enough from the street, but actually getting into the store is a real challenge.

Sure, it is easy enough if you are walking, but who walks?  Recently the Charlotte metro area was ranked the second highest gas-guzzling city by Forbes, and surely we did not get that ranking by walking everywhere, right?

So if you are driving, you can either park in the driveway area, and hop up a couple of steps, which is probably the easiest access, or you can swing around back, and then down the alley-like hallway to the entrance, which is not obvious, but is probably the way most people will take, since parking in the driveway may not be the best approach.

As to the store itself - nothing out of the ordinary.  Service is average, food is average.  It is generally fairly clean.  Nothing else of note."}
{"text":"Subway started making some of their large subs available for just $5, which is pretty cool.  It's tough to get a meal that feeds two people - and growing kids especially - for just $5, so we decided we would stop in.

With the apparent dropping of Jared as their spokesman, and the emergence of Mr. Bill as interim spokesman, while they wait for Michael Phelps to record his spots, we figured it was time for us to check out Subway again.  After all, we aren't even like Jared, but we are like Mr. Bill.  Phelps, however, is scary - no way can we swim like that madman.  So we better get in while the getting is good.

Anyway - imagine our surprise to find out that Subway now sells pizza.  It's like everyone is getting into everyone else's business.  Sub shops cook their subs and sell pizza (see Bellacino's), pizza stores sell subs - will the madness never cease?

I have to say that the $5 subs aren't a bad deal at all.  And they make lunch awfully affordable.  But the pizzas really suck.  They are about the size of a personal pizza at Pizza Hut, and that means that you need two or three of them to fill you up.  In other words, pass on them and stick to the $5 large subs.

Service at this location is great - big thumbs up on that.  I'd much rather go here than some of the other places that I've been, and definitely better than the Dairy Queen just across the parking lot."}
{"text":"Overall good store. Have to say tho they are not very helpful over there. They sell cardinals cups to win tickets and you can't even get anything on your receipt. Th girl working has no idea and it's just annoying. I also would like to talk about how they make the sandwiches. Just throwing it together I mean, I am spending money to each and I mean I have basically a pickle sub lol.  Nice store but the staff needs some work on customer service and be educated on promtions"}
{"text":"Decent location. Staff lacks personality. Very dry staff but food was pretty good. Very close to my work so prob would come back but wish the staff was more excited about having a job. 

Food was good, little light on the meat but overall I would give this location a 2 star.. I have been to better subways in Goodyear. Very friendly staff and it's fun to go in there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to eat at Subway yesterday evening around 11:30 pm. Normally we visit the Subway on Stephanie Street but we were passing by the Subway on Russell and Whitney Ranch and decided to just go ahead and save some time. 
When we walked in and walked up to the counter, no one was there, but we're pretty patient people. It only took about 30 seconds for a gentleman to walk up to the counter to us. I did not get his name I wish I had for this post but he looked like a 20 something year old maybe Asian gentleman. First of all he did not speak to us. I was the one who said hello to him. He did not smile, he was not pleasant, and when I was telling him what I wanted on my sandwich after every ingredient I said, he quickly asked \"anything else?\" as if I was wasting his time. I'm like...yeah I want more on my sandwich. Onions,  \"anything else?\" Pickles, \"anything else?\" Avocado \"anything else?\" 
Very rude and also annoying to be rushed.
 My boyfriend saw all this and ordered his sandwich knowing how impatient the guy was so he told him all the ingredients he wanted at once. And then the guy forgot and he had to repeat it all. Still making no eye contact and showing he truly hated his job. He took us to the cash register and of course asked, \"anything else?\"
We said no thank you and it took him what seemed like 2 minutes to ring up the 2 sandwiches. He told us the total and we gave him the money he gave us the change and we were the ones who told him to have a good night. 
We are never going to return to the Subway location all because of one single employee."}

There's nothing WORSE than having a long day at work and trying to get something quick for dinner, but someone messing it up. Normally this Subway is on point, but NOT TODAY.

Not to mention, I used to be a Sandwich Artist so I'm VERY familiar with servings, meat/cheese placement and not to be stingy with the damn veggies..."}
{"text":"This Subway is where I go when after being bombarded with massive advertising I finally get the stupid idea that a sub might taste good. So typically on a weekend once every month or so I might wander in here and order a small meatball sub for my son, a Spicy Italian for her, and a Chicken Bacon Ranch or Tuscan Chicken for me. It gets bagged up with 3 chocolate chip cookies and out the door I go. 

Not that much later it's the same result every time. My son will eat almost anything so his sub is gone, but for her and I, we look at each other and say WTF were we thinking? Oh that's right, we weren't thinking. Or we had recited the list of boring food to go options for the 17,000th time: Chinese x6, Thai, crappy pizza, Wendys, Arbys, Sonic, KFC, Toxic Hell..oops I meant Taco Bell, more crappy pizza, Famous Dave's overly SALTED BBQ complete with NASTY \"Sauce\", uber small portion Panera Bread, \"We give surly service and muck up your order\" Chipotle, etc and sometimes you just succumb to what's close to the I-515 so you can get in, get out, and choke down some boring food so your stomach will shut up. 

When you live way out in Hendertucky, it's not like you have a lot of options. All of you Westsiders have so many more options and don't know the hell of wanting good food but it's so far away that by the time you drive back it's ice cold. But it's the price you pay for being close to a 5 star school and having some peace and quiet...and HOA's that are not overly obnoxious and stupid. 

2 Stars. 1 Star for the Staff, 1 Star for the Chocolate Chip Cookies. Chocolate makes one forget about the questionable highly processed bulk meat that was just consumed and is a pleasant alternative to just blasting all of their food with Tabasco sauce."}

I can customize my order, even to the point of telling them which sub I want toasted. Payment is also through the app so all I need to do is walk in and pick it up. I've ordered this way several times and have never had a problem. The food has always been ready, and I don't have to wait in line. The place is clean and there is plenty of parking so I never need to walk very far. I've eaten there once or twice. Workers are friendly."}

CRAMPED!
HARD TO NAVIGATE!

Just went here for lunch - will never go back again.  The staff were rude, it was not \"buys\" in there at all.  They messed up my order by putting on the wrong sauce and then got mad when I asked for it to be fixed....it wasn't a big fix - just pull off the suff that I didn't want.....

The bread was not fresh - even though it looked like it came out of a fresh tray.  I didn't have it toasted, but it sure tasted like I did.

Looking through the glass I saw a selection of clean, FRESH meats, cheeses, & vegetables. The counters were clean & everything in order! I added extras to my meal/combo & sat down to eat. My sandwich was DEEEELICIOUS. You can find bad customer service anywhere - but NOT HERE! Very pleasant experience. It was a simple meal but I was amazed - THANKS!

This is one of my \"healthy\" lunch places: sandwich on wheat (6\" or 12\" depending on appetite, no cheese), baked chips, and diet Coke.  The place is clean, the veggies are fresh, and the service is good.  Not much more to say than that.  This is a good Subway."}
{"text":"I only come here for the convenience of location. Their turn over rate is ridiculous. There are always brand new employees always working alone with no extra help. And when I return a few weeks later those employees are replaced with brand new ones. The food is prepared well, I don't have a complaint about that. I think maybe the owner is cheap and doesn't have 2 people on every shift in order to save money. I hate coming here and damn myself every time I leave because the length of time it takes to make 3 sandwiches is unbearable. Hire more employees!"}
{"text":"The employees at this Subway have always been refreshing and welcoming. I work in the mall so I've gotten food from them quite a bit. They always go out of their way to ask how I'm doing and remember what my usual order is. I really enjoy this staff."}
{"text":"Great experience! Went there last week the girls where really friendly! I was on my lunch break it was my first time at that location! Had to mention how great the service was!"}
{"text":"This Subway is fine, I used to get sandwiches here most days when I worked at nearby Sam's Club which gave me good pay but no benefits or opportunities for career growth.

-1 for too small a parking lot for the \"lunch rush\", during which I and other over-qualified, under-employed folks crowded into this Subway because it takes credit card, and none of us had real liquidity"}
{"text":"I visited this place twice recently. The place was clean enough. Service was good. No reason to complain. I will definitely visit here often."}
{"text":"I teetered between a 3-4 on this one due to the fact that the first time we stopped in the girl seemed really annoyed that we came in a HALF HOUR before close!  Everything was already shut and wrapped and we could tell it really bothered her that there was actually a customer in there that close to closing.  It was 30 minutes before closing!  She wasn't too friendly.  

BUT...

We've been here two more times and it's been great.  The last guy that made our sandwiches was awesome.  To be honest it was probably one of the best Subway sandwiches I've ever had.  This was about ten minutes before closing and he displayed customer service at it's finest.  Overall a solid Subway.  Kind of annoying that they and most other food places close so early but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Went in to pick up dinner tonight. 
The chick was by herself at first with customers ahead of us, but didn't get overwhelmed.
She greeted us when we first walked in & was quick & efficient but nice also.  
The food seemed fresh!
A decent 'fast food' experience is always one I'm grateful for.
Thanks Subway on Trop & Eastern!"}
{"text":"Definetely the place of choice if you're looking to eat healthy.  I always get the 6\" turkey and ham on wheat... load it up with veggies and top with a little mustard.  Don't get chips or a soda.. it will ruin the healthy lunch!

I think the service is okay.. they are a bit slow.. and the line can get really long.  I also think they could improve by having somebody clean off the tables.  Often times the tables have crumbs and water all over it.. they need to hire somebody to clean it off!"}
{"text":"Asked for fresh tuna out of refrigerator, the guy tells me he has to \"sell this stuff first.\" Then checked his phone. Don't waste your time. Go to a different Subway."}
{"text":"Okay, first time in this store at night and so far not impressed. Usually good service during the day shifts. Walked in and there was a line. One of the workers made a sarcastic remark about another employee not being there yet. Really guys? C'mon dude. Just do your job and please hurry. Then the other dude commented on how he still had 10 minutes left. Everyone in line knew when the third guy was here because the first guy made another comment. 
Just wasn't in the mood for sour attitudes. Once the third guy showed up, the line moved pretty fast. After that the service was good. The guy at the register was good, efficient and was personable.
Love the coupons in the receipts!!"}
{"text":"Went there on Wednesday asked for an assorted he said sorry we don't have any bun's that they are baking to sit down and wait.I told him what do wait to use the last bun and then start baking new one's that is no way to run a subway.He said that it was a good thing that they never had any bun's,i started to laugh and told him yes it is a good thing because you just lost me as a customer and the guy after me walked out as well."}
{"text":"Ok..yes they are in a casino..BUT FOR THE PRICE..HIRE ENOUGH HELP!##
got soup $3 for half a cup ?? !!
Severely inept help..need real training--probably not their fault..
Plenty of other good food outlets in this food court..try somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Worst subway I've ever been to. 
The guy working there almost fell asleep making our sandwhiches, was nasty when we asked for more lettuce and deep sighed as he was putting it on as if it was actually paining him to do so. 
We had to take these on the road and asked for more than the 2 slivers of napkins that was given to us and the other worker (white girl with pig tail braids) and she yelled \"you can only have one more!\" Tf stingy ass subway is this? RUDE RUDE RUDE. Subway - care about the people you hire. This was appalling."}
{"text":"Service was terribly poor that reflect to the manager  that was assigned to this place. Customer service training is needed to your staff.
 Server can not give us cup for water since there is non. We asked cup for soda use but still refuses to give us one. Who ever is the manager 
Wake up.."}
{"text":"Service is ok. Subs always consistently made. They actually give you more on your sandwich than most other Subways."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location.  On my visit today for lunch, it was a bit dirty and they are very skimpy on veggies.  The employees don't seem to enjoy their jobs either. 

I live close by this location, but it's well worth the drive to 51st ave and baseline to go to the subway next to Fry's.  It's clean and they always make a great sandwich. 

I won't be going back to this location nor recommend it to friends, family, and neighbors."}
{"text":"Horrible service, sandwich was wrong. Staff is rude and not knowledgeable of Subway current deals. By far worst subway experience I've had."}
{"text":"Long story short, today was my final straw with this location even though it is closest to my work and has a convenient drive thru. I always place my order online so I can pick it up quickly and not once has it been quick in the year that I have been coming to this location. For example, today it took me 20 minutes and 2 times through the drive thru just to get my sandwich that was ready for pick up 10 minutes prior to my arrival. I have even tried going inside when I have more time and the service is extremely slow. It has never been packed or even busy, they just disappear in the back and try to make up for it with extreme kindness and smiles EVERY TIME. Very frustrating when I give them the benefit of doubt for a whole year, and nothing ever changes except it gets worse."}
{"text":"Will never return to this location. Young lady making the sandwiches was cursing up a storm while I was there with my YOUNG children. Don't get me wrong, I curse too but infront of children I don't. I used to love this location and it's so close to my house, but I don't really want my kids picking up that language from them."}
{"text":"Came here tonight and Arthur was absolutely awesome! He works so hard and was running back and forth to make sure everything was getting done(even though he was by himself) . I came in around 10pm and he offered such great service and was genuine and nice about it. He needs some recognition for how hard he works at night!!!!"}
{"text":"They haven't been able to toast your bread in over two weeks. This is bad for business I've been there 3 times trying to get a sandwich and every time it was the same story. No urgency to fix the problem, what makes them think I want a cold sandwich that's suppose to be hot?"}
{"text":"I'm giving this location 5 stars due to their outstanding treatment of my son.  I ordered his sandwich cold and he wouldn't eat it.  I returned to the counter to buy another sandwich that was hot for him. (He's autistic). They made another sandwich and I tried to pay but they refused.  This is customer service that goes above and beyond as far as I'm concerned.  My son thanked them as did I.  Great staff"}
{"text":"I was headed home and decided to stop in and pick up dinner. My order was pretty simple-a footling BMT. I asked for 3 toppings and then LIGHT salt & pepper and LIGHT oil & vinegar. I paid for my meal and drove home-5 mins away. I sat down to eat and my sandwich had A LOT of pepper and was already soggy from the oil & vinegar. UGH. If you can't follow simple directions on a simple sandwich (which is what you are known for and make them all day every day) then I don't need to waste my money here. Thank you but no thank you."}
{"text":"Been in a few times since this review & haven't seen the super slow ones, but on of the managers, I think its Chris. He's awesome, speedy & makes a delicious sandwich that look good! Yes! I did see 2 of the slow pokes at the one of deer springs & Elkhorn, by Rockstar Nails."}
{"text":"Long story short, I got raw chicken on my sub. No refund because the manager said that it was not raw. The cashier was very kind and professional, she was the only good part of my visit."}
{"text":"Service here is hit or miss. Subway prices have gone up. Penn Station is across the parking lot. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:44 on January 23rd, close time was 9pm. The open sign in the window was turned off and lobby lights were turned off. There were 3 children in the lobby. A couple of them sleeping on the tables, the other sitting looking bored. They looked like they were waiting for something. 

The door opened, though, but the woman inside said \"we're closed!\" I said, \"I thought you closed at 9?\" After gazing dramatically at the clock on the wall for a few moments, she looked at me and replied \"I already cleaned the line\" while indicating to the clean assembly area behind the counter. I asked \"is the food still out? You don't close until 9, right?\". She acted irritated and didn't say anything. I said \"it's 8:45, and you close at 9, right?\" She acted very annoyed and then said she would make me a sandwich. I said no it's okay, not with the way she was acting. 

It was clear at that point the kids were hers, just waiting for her to get off of work. So annoyed! I have a kid to get home to, also! Ugh. Not coming back, I will go out of my way to the franchised Subway at Guadalupe & Alma School!"}
{"text":"Do not use the drive-thru at this location! They have messed up my order 5 out of 5 times I have used the drive up. They act like they don't care. My husbands sandwich toppings end up on mine, mine end up on his and we have never gotten a sandwich made correctly. Save yourself the annoyance of paying $7 for a sandwich just to get it wrong."}
{"text":"Food is excellent as it could be for Subway. Been in multiple times since I work in the area. Restaurant is always clean, same with the restrooms. The staff is very friendly has made me come in more than once deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Tall slim black guy who works overnight  has music blasting looks drunk and high and has a bad attitude"}
{"text":"Not going back. This is not the first time that they give me my sandwich with barely anything in it. Not only are they stingy with their meat, they are also stingy with their vegetables. They pinch a few out of their container and place them exactly in the middle without even spreading them out throughout the sandwich. I always have to open my sandwich up and spread them out myself. The employees are also very dull and the store is just lifeless."}
{"text":"for some reason this place isn't as packed as it should be considering it's location.

$5 foot long will last for lunch and dinner.  what a great deal.  Cal.s are low too compared to fast food places."}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I've been to this use to be favorite subway. Customer service has really went down the drain. With me being the only one in the whole store, I wasn't understanding the rush. My coffee cup had hair in it and only thing I got was a \"how did that get in there\", can't complain to the manager because; she was the manager. After given a new cup from another employee which was filled to the rim I was told \" Just dump it out behind you\" the manager laughed and their convo continued. In need of more then 2 napkins why ask and get more rudeness...I grab a stack and went about my business. Would I return? Nope, I will take my butt across the parking lot to the Wal-Mart location. ; )"}
{"text":"I've been trying to keep myself from writing a review about this particular subway because every time I walk in its terrible, but here I am. Maybe its just me, but this is THE worst Subway ever. Theres always something, once they were out of tomatoes, another time they were out of shredded cheddar cheese (that time the person making my sub went as far as to tell me they've never had cheddar cheese as an option), and, my most regular complaint, they never, NEVER have soup. No matter what time of the day you walk in, no matter if they've had no business that day, they never have soup. Once it was 12:30, lunch time everywhere, but not there, they told me that time that they start making soup later in the day because nobody asks for it during lunch. I don't usually like to complaint like this, but every time I walk into this place theres something that ticks me off."}
{"text":"I really love this Subway location, its always clean, the staff is friendly and nice. I really like subway soup, and sometimes in other locations when they are out of it they don't make any more. Here they are always willing to do it, and don't make you feel uncomfortable about it. This is my first choice for Subway."}
{"text":"The food was good, Mgr was a little heavy on the salt and pepper, but she was also a little abrupt and slightly rude. This is why I only gave 2 stars. I don't care if you're having personal problems or employee ones, when it comes to customers a smile and pleasant tone go a long way. It wasn't there tonight."}
{"text":"Fail. 

I go once in a great while here [like once a year]. 

I called for a 6 foot sub for an event a few days in advance. First off, the respondent was nice although she was clueless what a 6 foot sub [am I that old ?! Subway used to promote these when I was a teenager]. I had to explain to her my situation and what I was looking to order, but she was still a bit clueless. Fortunately, subway has a nice website and listed my options (portions, available toppings, etc) so I told her my order. 
I asked for a price and confirmation of the order. She didn't know of the price and stated that the manager would call me back later that day with the price and to confirm the order. I never received a call. The next day, I called again, explained the situation, and they said they had no record of the order, the manager wasn't in, and they would call me back again. No surprise that they never called back.

I'll avoid from now on.

If you're in Old Brooklyn and looking for a sub sandwich, visit Gentile's just down the road, Jimmy John's in Steelyard, or Burt's on Memphis."}
{"text":"Subway is suppose to be some good, health, quick food! And this place \"magically\" turned those wonderful sandwiches into some poisonous food!
Please get your phone ready and dialed to 911 if you are planning on eating here, or this could be an awesome place if you need a doctor note for any of your tests or assignments, good luck!"}
{"text":"This subway location is brand new and it's open until 10pm. Its a small subway, with four tables inside and three outdoor seating tables. Eveything is very clean. The sandwich bar is really fresh, no nasty lettuce and old tomatoes! I checked out the bathroom too and it was clean. The staff is really nice and friendly.

This location is conveniently located right next to a Starbucks too. Right on the corner of Flamingo and Eastern. They did a nice job preparing my $4 lunch special black forest ham 6\" sub. I will definately be back :-)"}
{"text":"I witnessed the manager have a meltdown and verbally abuse another employee. I'll go to another subway."}
{"text":"Too filthy for me. Unwashed hands. Heard female behind counter tell a young male, \"if a customer gives you the exact amount, put the cash in the other box.\""}
{"text":"A great subway location!!  

I like the fact that they offer to toast (not forced on you like Quiznos)."}
{"text":"I just came into town for the day. Needed a quick bite to eat. While I was in line I witnessed the most obnoxious customer who was just down right rude to 3 staff members. Jessie was helping this customer and I was so impressed with how he handled this very rude customer. As I was eating my sandwich I watched this same employee sweep up the lobby and greet everyone walking in and out. My sandwich was good but I was most impressed by the supurb customer service Jessie was providing. Good job Jessie!"}
{"text":"The food was good I asked for a cold cut 6 inch the lady that did my sand which put to much mayo on all I could taste was mayo other than that it was good"}
{"text":"I am so fed up with the location #11190-0 at 1105 S Rainbow Blvd in Las Vegas, NV.  The only reason I've come back here is because it's close to my house but I am NEVER coming back ever again. 9 times out of 10 employees are RUDE and talk crap while I'm still in the store in Spanish! News flash some white people speak Spanish. I ordered a 6 inch BMT with no salami and I added bacon. The girl, Lesslie (on my receipt), snapped at me and said we don't substitute meat on sandwiches. So....can I just add bacon...? She rudely let me know it was going to be extra. I already knew that because I get this sandwich all the time. I don't normally like causing a scene in public especially in an environment that made me uncomfortable between the employees. But my 5.68 cents got me TWO pieces of ham and THREE pieces of pepperoni. What a sick joke. I get that bacon is 75 cents extra. But almost 5 dollars equals 5 pieces of meat that doesn't even cover the sandwich? What a joke. At least she gave me TWO napkins in case I make a mess...I decided to not get the meal and go next door to Wendy's to get a drink because these people don't deserve any of my money. 

DO NOT GO HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Two stars for this location and the WONDERFUL employee named Stephie is the only reason why it's not a 1 star (NOT stephanye). She is one of those people who is happy to be alive. I love seeing her at subway everyday being so upbeat and great at her job. She deserves a raise!!

Lines are terrible but typically move pretty fast, so not mad about that. What I am mad about is that there is something really strange going on at this location with money. Last week I was overcharged for a single chicken breast salad (salad only, no meal or sides) and it cost $7.50 plus tax. Yesterday, I was got a ham and cheese 6\" meal with a large drink. The charge for chips/large drink is \"MISC RETAIL $2.90\" my sandwich itself was $4.09. When I got to the register my total was never said outloud to me so I just handed ASHLEY a $20 and got my change and left. During busy times they really move you through like cattle, no time to double count. I sat down at a table in the SU and thought something was off. At first I thought she shorter my change by $5, but that wasn't it. I looked at my receipt and sure enough there's another MISC RETAIL charge for exactly $5. What the hell is that???? I'll post a picture of my receipt as well. I'm in contact with the franchise owner and I really hope they'll make it right.

DOUBLE CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS WHEN CHOOSING THIS LOCATION!!!!

The employee ASHLEY is so rude and never cracks a smile. I would never hire her for anything and she deserves to be seriously disciplined. Don't work with the public if you hate your job, it rubs off on the customers and puts a bad taste in our mouth. Especially next to an exceptional employee like Stephie, you look even worse. Get a grip. 

My two receipts where I'm overcharged were rang in by 1) Stephanye (salad) and 2) Ashley (ham meal). Beware dining here."}
{"text":"LONG lines during lunch rush, avoid at all costs!!

However, I like that this location is at the north end of campus near the engineering building. I'll snag a sandwich when they open at 9am so I can have it after my class at 11:15. Employees are okay, nothing special, and nothing to complain about.  I like that there's two sides to order at during busy times. I wish the building was bigger to accommodate the long lines, but that's alright. 

Another side note, their soda fountain is always in tip top shape. Never gotten anything flat or weird tasting from it, which is nice."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service every time I come here. They aren't stingy with veggies either! They had no problem making a meat substitution that *another* location had every issue with. I've been inside and through the drive thru and it's always perfect every time. Will always come back here! Drive thru needs a remodel though."}
{"text":"This is the worst sub way i have visited so far. Employees have no idea on how to prepare a sub. They just put little quantities of meat and other stuff on it and didn't even ask me if anything else was required. Even before i asked for the dressing i wanted he started wrapping it. Also by they time i reached my car i saw that it was wrapped so bad that it fell apart, as if i picked it up from trash. Will never step into this one again!"}
{"text":"Just saw that they failed their health inspection at least twice in 2016.  Source ABC15 news.  Failed in both June 2016, and March 2016."}
{"text":"All Subways are the same, right? Incorrect. Factors like customer service, cleanliness, and FRESHNESS make all the difference with this Subway!

Lastly, let's not forget spinach. I will not eat at a Subway if I'm stuck with iceberg lettuce!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Parking is horrible. Ive had to skip in several times and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"An ok subway. Usually quick service. When I sit in the glassed area near the road I feel one typo while txting and ill have a car in my lap. The food tastes decent. Pulling out of the parking area can be horrible at times.The place had been clean each time. I also use Apple Pay on every visit with no issues."}
{"text":"I had a decent experience at this location. The food was fresh the service was fast and friendly. It is located inside of the Arizona Charlie's casino. This makes it very convenient while gambling here to stop for a snack. There is ample seating located in front of the subway where you can eat."}
{"text":"Located inside the Suncoast hotel, it's a nice stop for a quick bite to eat. The service was fast and friendly. The food is on par with the rest of the Subway chain restaurants. There is an ample seating area, but it is open air to the casino so the sounds and smells drift in."}
{"text":"I LOVE Subway, but this one is just awful. It was dirty and the two counter people were total jerks, and totally clueless. Asked for a pizza with pepperoni, something they've been advertising forever so I thought they'd DEFINITELY know how to do it, but no. I looked away for a second, and before I knew it the pizza came out with American cheese on it for some odd reason. I asked for another and she tried to charge me. I will never go to this one again- definitely the worst restaurant experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"Went here with my friend and her daughter and the tables were dirty (All of them) which for the fact no one was there and two girls working behind the counter, there was no reason for it.  Also they both didn't seem to like their jobs because of their attitudes. One girl was cleaning out some gunk from the bottom of the cooling bin where the metal containers rest on to keep the ingredients cold but she wasn't careful nor paying attention to the fact that stuff kept falling into the bins with clean ingredients because she held the dirty rag over the clean food. Not the smartest bulb in the bunch. If it wasn't for the fact my friends daughter was hungry I would never have eaten here."}
{"text":"During the weekday, at lunch time, always have a long line. On Sunday lunch, it wasn't that long, it run smoothly. The services were average, not expecting too much."}
{"text":"Eat healthy!  The service is great!  It's not too many people in the line at 1.34pm but it's good!"}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and courteous. Always go above and beyond. Clean store, fresh food and bread baked daily."}
{"text":"I recently visited this location and had a bad customer service experience. Then I received a call from the manager, Amanda, she was very nice and apologized for what had happened. Even though her service and attitude were top notch I just can't give subway 5 stars."}
{"text":"I like Subway because of the fresh bread and veggies.   The Tuscola Subway franchise has my favorite sandwich  which is Seafood Delight.  I always get it on Italian Herbs and Cheese bread which is  fresh. My 2nd favorite is the Club.  They always make my sandwich per my directions and I always get double meat.  They're super nice and very helpful.  They make sure they have my sandwich right  and  remind me each time I get a free cookie because I double the meat.  I usually go at night and its always clean and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Went here early this morning. The girl behind the counter was nice. I ordered a turkey sandwich and it was honestly the softest bread I've had from Subway."}
{"text":"Subway is the place to go to if you have no idea what to eat. They have a wide variety choices to choose from: whether you want breakfast, lunch, or dinner they have different combos to fit your needs. Their location is great and very easy to spot while you're driving. Staff was friendly and welcoming. I am definitely going to be back here much more often."}
{"text":"I travel about 15 minutes, passing 5+ Subways, just to get to this location. I love eating here and I do rather often. I enjoy almost everything about this particular location.

For starters, like I mentioned in my tip, this place is the cleanest Subway I've ever been to. The veggies are always fresh looking. The veggie containers are always full. The meats are well separated and equally proportioned. The cookies are always organized and stocked. The chips are always stocked and front faced. The floors, tables and glass are usually spotless. I really appreciate a nice and clean restaurant and they do a great job at keeping me happy.

Now, I, like anyone else, enjoy good a sandwich. I will go out of my way, obviously, to get a well made and good tasting sandwich. My only requirement is that it's made exactly like I like it.

For the most part, my sandwiches are always made correctly. When I say correctly, I mean, if I ask for light lettuce, I don't want a whole pile of it, or if I ask for extra pickles, I don't want 2 or 3 extra.

Sam, my favorite sandwich artist here, has really good customer service skills. He know damn well he doesn't care about what happened to Jared, but every-time I comment on it, he always responds lol. He gives me a full conversation each and every time lol. He's super cool. I wish the lady's would pick up on his good vibes.

They accidentally switched my sandwich with another customer's sandwich. I called right back up to the store and Sam put my name down for a free sandwich. I wasnt even mad. I just like that fact that when I called back and described myself as the \"chubby girl\", he dismissed it and said the lady that ordered the steak. I thought to myself, he's a nice guy, because I would have said, \"oh yeah, I know, \"the fat one\".\"

I also left my debit card there when I went to get my free sandwich. I wouldn't have known anything about it but one of the ladies called and told me. I was so thankful. I know some companies, with employees with no integrity, would have had a field day with my card.

One of the only complaints is, the ladies always talk over my sandwiches. I tell them exactly how I like it, there's no need to really talk over them. I just don't like the idea of them getting excited and spitting on my food. A lot of people spit when they talk. Maybe it's a good idea to get mouth covers for sandwich artist.

I will definitely go back. They should give me Frequent Sub Eater Card. I would really recommend this place then."}
{"text":"Sloppy sandwich plus being over charged equals never going back! The sandwich was overfilled and fell apart. Had to remind them of their $5 deal after the over charged me. Forget this subway!"}
{"text":"Do not come at 10:30 pm. I went on a Friday night and they close at 11.The store will already be packed up and the person there will scold you for not coming earlier. 

When I got to the Subway it was 10:35... 2 other people were in front of me. The attendant had already packed everything away before we had gotten there because he was pulling it all out to serve the people in front of me. When he got to me, he told me I should have come earlier if I wanted 3 subs.

I told him I thought he closed at 11 and I was there at 10:35. He then replied that he packs up early... if he didn't want to serve any one else he should have turned off his sign. Very rude service."}
{"text":"The food was as good as any other subway. what i like at this subway over others is that they put the sandwich in a basket when I told them I was eating in the restaurant. I never could understand why subway always gives the sandwich wrapped in paper and put in a bag whether you are getting it to go or not. It was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Its just a subway but I like this location.  The staff is great and always welcomes us when we walk in.  They are quick even when a moron orders five sandwiches to go and is relying on their memory instead of having it written down.  And no, I am not the moron lol."}
{"text":"Perhaps someone should provide some generally health / sanitation guidelines.  It is not very pleasant to see the cashier lick her fingers to pick up the napkins."}
{"text":"I came here bc I wanted Subway for lunch, the artisan was cheerful and friendly. She did a good job at making my sandwich and kept the station clean. The ingredients were as good as it gets for a subway. I look forward to my next stop here whenever I'm craving a sandwich"}
{"text":"This location is the ONLY location I've seen use the protective glass over the food when not in use. It's very clean and the workers where very nice, and greeted me as soon as I walked in. 

Something else about this location they have free meals for the homeless every Wednesday from 3-5pm. That's so amazing and I've never seen that either. Glad this location is giving back to the homeless who need food."}
{"text":"Their food is always great,  only downfall is it seems as if their a bit picky with their portions that they put on their sandwiches.  I always ask for them to put on extra and it's very little.  It's like going to a fastfood and asking for hot sauce and they give you 2 for 4 tacos.  Other than that their flatizzas are always made great,  and that is always what I get from now on due to their stinginess of sauce."}
{"text":"This is the worst subway I've been to! The service was terrible and they were even worst at making a sandwich, let alone trying to have them make something the correct way. Spend your money somewhere else. I will never return to this location. I wish I could get my money!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If i could give no stars I would  this is the worst Subway ever. Jerica did her best under the circumstance of the horrible management but this place is very poorly run. The employees are told to not give out water cups to PAYIng customers. I purchased two meals and one drink and wanted water because I do not drink anything else but water and the poor girl was scared to loose her job if she gave me a cup for water. There was no one else in the store and it took 20 minutes to make a 1/2 sub and a cheese pizza. Greedy business owners like this are have got to go. Go get a job a Starbucks Jerico and get yourself a 401 k!"}
{"text":"Subway is one of my good choices for fast foods. The one in here close to UNCC is really good. It's a bit far but I go running on weekends and end up there for the lunch. The staff are good and the food is just yummy...of course you should know how to make/select the your own sandwich to enjoy it..."}
{"text":"Clean and tidy. The sandwich I had there was perfect, I can't say that about too many subways. They are definitely not one of these subways that skimp on the toppings. I'll probably be driving out of my way to this one when I eat subway again. Only thing I didn't like is most of the people that work the lunch hour only speak Spanish and you have to point to what you want on your sub Lol."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night around 1045PM. The hours on the website said until 11. As I pulled up to park the open light was blinking brightly. I walk up to the doors and they're both locked. As some kid who works there comes from the back I mouth to him are you closed. He shakes his head yes. As I then look at the hours posted on the door which says they're open until 11pm. I come here frequently and have had great customer service. But what is the point of having set hours posted on the door when your employees close up before then?!"}
{"text":"We really like subway. We both get the sweet onion chicken teriyaki just with different toppings. I rated this subway three stars because sometimes the employees are not very friendly. They do a good job though and are pretty fast."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered three footlongs. The clerk was checking us out before the last sandwich was even made and even though there were two people assembling on the line, I still had to repeat the veggies over until it was correct. The 2nd person to handle my sandwich was about to close my sandwich without asking me if I wanted any sauce or other condiments. 

The bread was cut almost all the way through so that made eating the sandwich messier than usual. They didn't even press the veggies in before closing, so the filling was loose. Not that it mattered because the sandwich wasn't put together well to begin with.

It is clear that more training is required."}
{"text":"Good Subway location. Ingredients are stocked and look fresh. Customer service is friendly. Place is always clean. A+"}
{"text":"Food is what you expect but the customer service could be better and more friendly. The place is cleaned and up to date. A quite little joint to get together with friends."}
{"text":"Just like any other Subway, you will be walking out smelling like Mustard. But this is a very convenient location as it is 24 hours! If you come here regularly, you will notice a lot of taxis parked outside, as it seems there is a dicount for taxi drivers, i am not sure what the discount is exactly since i am not a cab driver, but apparantly its good enough for them to keep coming back. They also give a discount for employees who work at the call center for MGM Resorts. 

The workers here have always been super nice to me. Definetly reccomend this location."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience at this store!!  I never had such rude customer service. I was treated like they just wanted to get me out of the store as quickly as possible and just threw my sandwich together really sloppy and rude like they did not want me there in that store.  I will never be back!!!"}
{"text":"I will never walk into this place again.  We went here Tuesday night and there was some guy working here all alone, with no customers at all,  he acted like we were inconveniencing him to make him work. My daughter wanted bacon and pepperoni on  her turkey sandwich. He stopped making the sandwich huffed and sighed and looked up at us and he actually said to me and my family \"that sandwich would be way too expensive\". EXCUSE  ME!!! who the hell is HE to tell me what is too expensive. IT was only an extra 1.25$. I still to this day cannot believe what he said,  and my husband and i were also gonna get sandwiches and chips and drinks and cookies, we didn't get anything else, we didn't dine in, we took our one \"very expensive sandwich\" and left and well never return. I mean sorry for making him work but he needs to think before he speaks, random strangers have no idea what is \"too expensive \" for a customer."}
{"text":"My family had stopped going to this Subway months ago because of the horrible service - dirty knifes used to cut our sandwiches, running out of items but still being charged for it, etc. Went back today because we needed a quick meal and were thrilled with the service! Not sure of the young woman's name (Riane? Rain?) anyway, she was super efficient, got our orders done quickly and correct, cleaned serving tools, etc.  We will go back because of the new staff!"}
{"text":"Friendly and quick. They were very nice to my kids when they were ordering. Parking was tough with a big car and they don't serve soup."}
{"text":"My family and I came in, we walked in speaking Spanish. As soon as we walked in and went up to the counter Malissa was being so rude! She gave us attitude right away! One other customers came in she was completely sweet and nice. I don't understand why she had to be so rude! It was so uncalled for and I am definitely never coming back to this location"}
{"text":"Efficient Line, good quick lunch spot . Meatball sub hot with lots of chunky marinara.
yum yum!"}
{"text":"I come here after my doctors appointments. The service is okay, I only have to tell them 4 times exactly what I just told them but it's fine at least they don't mess it up. Haven't found a hair in my tuna at this location yay. *knocking on wood though *"}
{"text":"There was an ant crawling across the counter when we checked out. 
I informed the server I have an allergy to milk (which includes cheese) and watched as the server picked cheese out of the steak and proceeded to scoop the contaminated steak onto my sandwich. They also used a visibly dirty knife to cut the sandwich and my boyfriend's wrap. I watched another employee \"clean\" the same knife for the next customer by wiping it with a paper towel.  This is cross contamination, there are people with really severe allergies and that could kill or seriously harm them. The lobby is dirty and unkempt, possibly explaining why an ant would be on the checkout counter. I told the server to inform his manager about the bug. Hopefully they take care of that."}
{"text":"Don't go to this location. There's one om 48th and Ray right down the street that makes amazing, meaty sandwiches with awesome always fresh bread, and they take expired coupons. This one won't take expired coupons, you're lucky if you get 3 pieces of meat on your sandwich and almost every time I've been the bread has been hard as a rock."}
{"text":"Don't go here food is old nasty  the associates are slow and don't have very good customer service more like they are ghetto! The bread is so hard and old it could literally break your teeth. Waste of money go somewhere else!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Canonsburg for 3 years now and have been to this Subway ~15 times.  It is far and away the worst Subway I have ever been to.  Why do I keep coming back?  Convenience and resolve that it won't be as bad as last time.  Iced tea is always empty.  Fountain drinks are mixed with too much carbonated water.  Work area is unkempt and there are usually flies."}
{"text":"The most dysfunctional subway I have ever been to.  I am in outside sales and eat at subway at least once a week throughout the pittsburgh area and surrounding.

I ordered a Tuscan chicken salad and you would have thought I asked them to paint the sisteen chapel!  The fountain drinks are cheapened by less syrup and more soda water.  The sweet tea is also cheapened with hardly any sugar.

The only redeeming quality is the young girl who works here.  She is very polite even when asking a peer for help with ringing up my order.  The peer got all up in arms about how they never trained them to do that.  The young girl politely asked for a moment, sought out who I believe to be the owner/manager and came back promptly with a solution.

I don't expect much from subway to begin with and this location is a far cry from bare minimum."}
{"text":"Food was decent but they BLASTED the hip hop music so we'd get out. At first I thought it was funny, then when the guy came out and told us they were closing and turned the music up even more, it was infuriating."}
{"text":"I came in and asked for a Chicken & Bacon Melt with Rotisserie Chicken rather than the cubed chicken they serve (Because my Husband Likes it like that better) & the two hispanic servers started talking crap about me and my \"preference\"  & how its because of my pickiness in spanish. The Idiots didn't know I am hispanic too and speak spanish. I paid for mg food and say goodbye and have a great day in spanish and their faces were priceless. Shut up about what I order and do your job and just make it for me. GRACIAS!!

Never going back again & both my husband & I are going to be speaking with the Manager b/c my husband went back and said something to them and denied everything. Lets see you deny it when Im talking to your manager in front of you. Dont judge people by their appearance because it can bite you back in the ass."}
{"text":"Can you make sure your employee not wearing a hoodie and have their name tag on at least! And THANK for hiring employee that can sell us grumpy attitude faces in the morning. First time and last"}
{"text":"Ok so this is by far my favorite Subway! The guys that work the shift in the evening when I came the last time I posted a review and last night, Matt & Scott, they are such good sports and definitely an asset to this store! They are pleasant, and remember me every time I come in, and make my sandwich perfect the special way I request it. You can't ask for much more, especially when you are a difficult customer! :)"}
{"text":"So 1 hour before closing the chairs were already up and the soda machine was already off. I ordered a tuna sandwich and went back home. I have to say that this was the most disgusting sandwich I have ever had. The bread was stale and the tuna was so salty, I ended up drinking a gallon of water. I just threw the sandwich away."}
{"text":"Usually great service by one of the great employees. Our company prefers to go here but we are thinking about Changing due to one of their employees.  Very rude  they forgot part of our order so we had  to go back.  Get there ask for one cookie to compensate  for the mistake and the employee said no!  REALLY?  Unfortunately she doesn't know anything about customer service!  we spend a lot of $ @this location. Maybe another location would appreciate our business."}
{"text":"I tried to eat here today, but they appeared understaffed. I waited in a short line for 15 minutes and it hardly moved! Ultimately I had to leave. I probably wouldn't go back here because it wasn't even peak hours!"}
{"text":"honestly, i have been to many subways and this one isn't so nice great. Not really the best staff, and slow."}
{"text":"Five stars you say?
Yes typical sandwich shop. EXCEPT for the fact that they work with the community very well. Giving the Karate school ACROSS the street BOGO's and  when the local schools need help they are also there. 
I've been in about 10 times, my kids young teens, probably 40 times in the last 3 years. The guys (usually never girls) are always on it! Even if they are in the back doing stuff they acknowledge that you are there and come right out. They open early and stay open late. THANKS FOR THE COUPONS AND SUPPORT, UR REGULARS APPRECIATE IT ESPECIALLY SINGLE MOMS WITH TEENS"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean bathrooms and new daily specials what more can you ask for. They are also super quick."}
{"text":"Don't come here if your wanting fast food. This place needs to hire time efficient employees. They never have enough help and the kid at he front never seems to know what he is doing. This location needs a General Manger. So frustrating that I called in an order and 20 min later is still not made. Get more employees please who know how to get the job done fast."}
{"text":"This subway is in a really great location, so they have an opportunity to do very well; however, they are THE SLOWEST. Took them 25 minutes to make a footlong. The kids behind the counter acted like they'd never made a sandwich before, but I know they have because I've seen them working before. Geez."}
{"text":"This seems to be a busy location, at least during lunch time. Service was prompt and employees were cordial."}
{"text":"Ghetto. Have to ask for EVERYTHING, I'm assuming because of the local population stealing everything that is not nailed down if it's free."}
{"text":"In a busy strip mall location and not the easiest in & out there is. Staff was friendly and my order was correct. Restaurant was clean and stocked. Average location overall."}
{"text":"Two young girls doing their best but service is SLOW. Polite and sweet, but both are very young and seem inexperienced and unsure. Food was OK but they were out of quite a bit of items despite it being only 6:30 pm."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly service. Above average."}
{"text":"Good fast service, friendly employees. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Above average location. Clean, friendly staff and prompt, efficient service."}
{"text":"It's subway.   They make sandwiches for you after you tell them what you want on them.    You already know this.  Did you know that they have soup?    Probably.    Is it good?    Who knows?       One thing I have found is that if you are counting calories, order any sandwich as the chopped salad alternative and it hardly makes a dent in your daily calorie budget.     I had to come back and bump the review up a star, simply for the friendliness of the staff and the great background music.   This particular location isn't quite as busy as some others during lunch, and the staff seems a little more positive than most."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and had an absolutely horrible experience.  While ordering I noticed and passed on the browning lettuce.  A few minutes later I got back to the office and opened my sandwich to find a hardened flatbread that is obviously days past it's usable shelf life.  Sometimes I chop up a bad experience as a one off bad day but this bread is so hard that this is beyond ridiculous.  I will never be back."}
{"text":"I am doing a favor to this place by giving them one star. Horrible service! You feel rushed the whole time. All the workers have an attitude problem. THEY DONT CARRY SPINACH, PEPPERJACK CHEESE OR AVOCADO! WTF!? And the jerks would not even put my bacon in the toaster to make it crispy yet it's ok to put my bacon in there if my whole sandwich is being toasted?? Screw this place... Avoid it at ALL costs.

They are marked expensive because their food sucks ass for one and their service puts the icing on the cake. They should pay me to walk in."}
{"text":"This has been the most vile, disgusting, and unsanitary Subway experience in my lifetime of eating Subway sandwiches. Now you may think this is an exaggeration, but what happened here today has ruined my view of Subway forever.

The good news is the cold cut combo has dropped in price to $5.00 for the footlong. As someone who is in between jobs, this is a nice filling and affordable lunch option. Things quickly went horribly wrong once I placed my order.

The meat was discolored in a sickly yellowish grey rather than a healthy pink. This meat had been sitting out in the air for far too long, and had spoiled. Anyone can tell that something was very wrong with the pre-sliced meat, but the employee tried to sneak it on my sandwich. After I called it out, he said nothing and placed the meat back on the paper and back on to the bin.

I should have just walked out at that point, but I ate the new cold cut combo. As I was was wrapping up my meal, the employee who made my sandwich was wiping tables. I walked up to him and said \"I can't believe you didn't just throw away the bad meat\" He replied \"Yeah, it looked way off. We probably will\".

Is this remotely close to how one should appropriately handle a food safety issue? What atrocious customer service and utter disregard for my health and others. This is completely unacceptable and the way this store went about this issue was so very wrong. 

Please heed my warning and stay away."}
{"text":"First I was greeted poorly then the lady just slapped my sandwich together and had an attitude the whole time I asked if she was the manager and she said yes for the last 10 years. If you have been running a business that long you'd think your customer service would be a hell of alot better. I won't be back on a side note my sandwich tasted like bad meat and not fresh."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow. Zero sense of urgency. I eat here probably twice a week and always find myself waiting. Specifically when they open up in the morning. I don't know if they are under staffed or what, but there's always a wait. To be fair, they are usually the only restaurant open at 10am. 

One thing that is frustrating, don't prioritize a to go order if the person picking up the food isn't there and there's a huge line. Frustrating"}
{"text":"Whoever owns this business needs to pay some serious attention to the restroom. I'm sorry but it was just awful...roaches, trash on the floor, brown stains on the wall, unbearable smell-not your typical bad bathroom smell with lots of traffic, this was worse...Businesses really undervalue the impression their bathroom can have on customers-I will not be back due to this."}
{"text":"You know when you're really hungry after a long day of work? Well that was the case when my husband and I went into subway. The two wetting were nice, forgot the girls name, and Robert. Upon check out the computer froze. There was no manager, and the two working didn't know what to do, so 20 minutes later, and 3 calls to the manager later, the computer started and we asked for a discount. The manager said no discount. Nothing. So here we are with 2 cold subs and 25 minutes wasted. Also, we were the only customers in there. I understand computers freeze, but a discount would have been nice. My stomach does not Thank you. Jessica, we deserve a discount."}
{"text":"Not a great Subway. It almost never has another customer, for reasons that are pretty clear. The staff is sullen and disinterested. They skimp on the ingredients (especially the vegetables -- ask for more to get the stink eye). Keep on going to the Subway on University and Country Club for a better experience."}
{"text":"If you are no longer open until Midnight, you might want to change ALL OF THE INTERNET LISTINGS THAT SAY YOU ARE (Google, Yelp, and Subway.com). Just came by, tried to come in, women inside ignored me and busily closed down the store. 11:00 PM isn't midnight, and I'm STARVING."}
{"text":"Walked in with my boyfriend and we were in a good mood, but then the Indian lady that works there looked angry and like if she hated her job. She was taking my boyfriends order and was rudely putting the ingredients together basically throwing them on there. Then asked for mayo and she put a skinny line, it just want pleasant being there the ingredients looked a couple days old for morning food. Definitely NOT \"fresh\". and our moods just decreased quick.Our sub builds weren't great either. Not coming back here again that's for sure."}
{"text":"Food wasn't ready when I came to pickup my online order. After waiting for 10 minutes she starts making it with 0 urgency and she didn't make it right anyway.  She was the only person on staff. Which is just terrible management. Will never come again."}
{"text":"go some place else people Worst place ever...
It all started a couple years ago when an employee came in from outside smoking a cigarette and went straight to the bread without gloves on...eww so gross, left without buying anything.  So I decided to  give them a second chance since it's been a few years just maybe things go better,  sadly mistaken. Employees are rude and acted like she had somewhere else to be. But i wasn't sure if they were employees unless sweatpants, a pink hoodie and headphones are the new uniforms for subway. Then a girl from outside in street clothes comes in and jumps right to making sandwiches without washing her hands. Wow so nasty! Thankfully some other girl made my sandwiches. I'm sorry but this is inexcusable. Unfortunately that was my last visit to this location."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood subway. They always have fresh ingredients. The people who work there are very nice, but usually really slow. I like to get the Spicy Italian footling. Please see my photo of the last one I had. Hopefully I've done it justice with the photo - it was beautiful."}
{"text":"Very poor today.  This place is usually pretty good but today was a different story. 
They didn't have much bread and no avocado,  when we got home opened up the sanders,  they were really lightly filed,  barely any tuna and virtually no mayo.  The bread was really tough as was my wife's,  so pretty sure it was stale. 
We are about to head back down to the store to raise hell.
This was definitely the worst Subway sandwich I've ever had"}
{"text":"This restaurant is horrible!  In particular, the service was totally lacking.  The restaurant was staffed by comatose teenagers who apparently have not been properly trained OR they just don't care.  One sandwich was wrapped in a dirty juice-splashed wrapper.  The food was tasteless and the service abysmal.....I won't be going there again!"}
{"text":"Worst subway ever been to, two girls working there so rude. Got mad when I asked for extra pickles. Wife got salad put little lettuce & she asked for more and she got rude & mad. Worst customer service ever. Counted how much meat & cheese she put on my sandwich. Never go to this subway location"}
{"text":"This is my 9 year olds favorite sandwich place. I will say subway has really stepped it up. They use to be so stingy with the meat and cheese..but at this paticular subway. The people working here really hooked it up. Hopefully all subways are the same now days. I doubt it 6-7$ for a footlong and 6 pieces of meat that's what i remember."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the friendliness and helpfulness of the subway sandwich maker who made my sandwich.  I will not hesitate to return to this subway in Homestead.  And the food tasted good."}
{"text":"Great experience at this subway. There was only one person behind the counter and it was busy yet he knocked out these subs lickitysplit.  Awesome! Everything looked fresh and clean as well."}
{"text":"Unless there is some sort of lettuce, pickle and banana pepper crisis in the world, I cannot for the life of me fathom why this place is so incredibly stingy in rationing out portions. I came here and ordered a salad (yes, some bizarre people do that when they go to a sandwich joint). There must be some sort of world wide shortage on tomatoes and lettuce that I was unaware of, because this lady filled my salad bowl with the same extreme caution of someone defusing a bomb.

Now, normally Subway's salads are full to the brimming with delicious, fresh ingredients. Here, you'll need to barter with the devil and give up one of your limbs if you want to have a container that isn't half empty. Can you ask for more? Sure, but that's sort of like asking, \"Here, take this thimble of water and pour it into my half empty glass\".

Unless you want to feel like a complete dick (or a showgirl) by repeatedly asking them for.. MORE MORE MORE!! (how do you like it? how do you like it?), be prepared to leave with a meager sized, unhappy meal. Seriously, is it so much for them to put a reasonable amount of salad in a meal that consists entirely of salad? Should I really HAVE to ask for (in the midnight hour...she cried) MORE! MORE MORE!???

I think not. Could I have? Yes. Would that have improved my dining experience? Perhaps. Maybe, like some of you out there, I just hate confrontation so much that it winds up costing me the things I want in life. And maybe that's a personality flaw I just have to deal with if I want to get my money's worth out of a salad from this place.

But every single time I go here they doll out veggies like they've got the last container of green peppers known to humanity, and I dislike that.
Take your business up the street to the Subway on 16th, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich I ever had. Go anywhere else. Overpriced too as well Subs are$5.25 for a 6\" and the bread was stale."}
{"text":"I was in there a month ago. I used my app to pick up my meal. When I arrived there was no meal to be found. They questioned my order and the fact I had ordered and even paid for anything !   They called the owner and the owner told them that they had unplugged their computer so the app didn't work. I asked to speak to the owner and they wouldn't let me.  I left my number and asked for the owner to call me back 
Never happened!!!"}
{"text":"One of the employees is bilingual! It's a subway, they smile at me because my sandwich has basically nothing on it but they're always courteous and even offered me hangover cures because, well, I looked it. We laughed about it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite subway so far, it has two separate sections and even though it gets pretty busy everything flows pretty quickly.
This location has free Wi-fi and Ethernet connections with nearby outlets; making it great for people on the go."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give a ZERO star rating 
I am so offended by some stupid employee thinking he's funny by telling me the Turkey is saved for the President and all we have is COCKMEAT!! 
How dare you!! I hope someone from corporate contacts me because I want that dude FIRED!!!"}
{"text":"10pm on a Friday night.  Wanted a hassle free french dip sandwich.  Tried Subway substitute steak sandwich.  Horrible.  How can they call it meat let alone steak?"}
{"text":"The man who is very clearly the owner/manager was sitting at a corner table while I ate my food. He was quiet other than when an employee asked a question (rather rudely) and he responded by rudely yelling in her direction. There were two men ordering sandwiches at this time. When I was ordering my sandwich the employee was too busy chatting with her fellow employee joking around to pay attention to what I was ordering. As always good taste but I'm not ok with watching employee and management berate one another."}
{"text":"This Subway location is inside a gas station.  I work a quarter mile away.  I prefer online and walk over to the store and my food is ready and is completed correctly.  I give 4 stars instead of 5 merely because there is no seating."}
{"text":"Not the best Subway I've been to, service was slow and well it is Arizona. Clean location though."}
{"text":"Service was really slow. Asked for napkins but they were out. Was only one person talking orders and making sandwiches"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!
Everytime I go in the employees never smile, are rude, talk to you with attitude, and it's a drag just sitting there to eat your sandwich.
It's really close to my house but I will for SURE not be going back to this one.
2stars because subway is still good."}
{"text":"Stopped here while I was driving home. I ordered the meatball marinara sub on whole wheat. The meatball marinara was the same as any other subway place I have been too so it didn't disappoint. The sub wasn't too toasted either. However, I did want an order of chicken noodle soup but they were all out so I had to settle for broccoli and cheese soup. The soup was okay. It was a bit too creamy for me."}
{"text":"This subway is amazing! I ordered a sandwich on a very busy day and all the employees were moving at an amazing pace and doing all the right things. My sandwich tasted super good and i took advantage of their 5.49 deal so I didn't have to spend a pretty penny for a filling meal. They deserve a lot more praise on here!"}
{"text":"Where to begin with this embarrassment of a food chain. Before starting, let me just say my expectations are not set high as if it's any other fast food place (del taco, McDonald's,  ect.). I expect the workers to typically be a high school student with a bad attitude. That being said they've somehow managed to lower the bar. They're reliable for bad service, screwing up your order & being easily overwhelemed. Recently they have gave away an order to the wrong person of the lady in front of me. They made her get back in line and start over and she still had to pay seeing the person in front of her got away with a free meal! They have screwed up countlessly, for example my brother got a subway MELT & because he requested the bread to not be toasted the sandwich was cold, meaning NO melted cheese & the bacon was RAW. I mean unthinkable situations they make possible. & if you dare order toppings they scarcely clump each selection on one area of the sandwich. Common knowledge of making a sandwich is easily overlooked. Avoid this location at all costs. No matter how many workers or managers this place goes thru they will never get it together. As noted, I'm not requiring a gourmet meal and over the top exceptional service. I don't imagine working at subway is the highlight of anyone's career or reason to get up in the morning but it is your paycheck so a little effort won't hurt. Sad other restaraunts in anthem seem to close down but a disappointment like this sticks around with multiple locations just minutes away with much better service. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place no matter what!"}
{"text":"This subway is great because it is right next to my apartment. Their is nothing special about this subway but them being open 24 hours! That's great and I love it."}
{"text":"This is the worst location I've ever been to. The employees are slow and they do not pay attention to what the customers are saying. Watched the other customers repeat themselves multiple times. Waited 25 minutes just to order. Can't give zero stars so 1 will have to do."}
{"text":"Super disappointing, especially since this is my closest Subway. Honestly, I'd eat Subway FAR more than I do if this location was better. So tired of my sub being thrown together, condiments just dripping all over and out it and then having it smushed down to a disgusting mess before being rolled up like a burrito and crammed into a bag. Sandwich artists?! Definitely not. The thing is, I know it's not impossible because I've had several other locations provide a solid sandwich. On top of it, the staff are rude and mumble. God forbid you ask for more than the sprinkle  of lettuce they give you...then your sandwich will definitely be made with more anger and hate."}
{"text":"This review is several months late but this was my experience around March 2016. I guess you could say I've been so shocked by the experience that I couldn't get myself to write a review. I went in for some breakfast and coffee. After I got my food I asked where my coffee was. They handed me a styrofoam cup. I went to the beverage counter and found the coffee. It was cold. Literally, cold. I said, \"This coffee is cold.\" The tall, dark-skinned woman who served me (I'm only describing as such for identification purposes, I'm not racist) said, \"All we can do is put it in the microwave for you.\" I gave it to her to put it in the microwave. At this point I wasn't sure I was willing to drink it. I returned to the beverage counter to look for the cream and Splenda. I found several open containers for it all, but they were empty. \"Where's the cream?\" \"We don't have any,\" she said as she rolled her eyes and handed me my microwaved coffee. I was floored. I ate my breakfast and threw the coffee away."}
{"text":"This particular Subway is just about as low as you can go. Nevermind the franchise's dwindling consumer base stemming from the pedophile Jarod, the plastic in the bread dough, the 11 inch footlongs, the very low quality you get for an unfair price. This Subway is so cheap that it forges the dates on it's food containers literally every single night in order to remain compliant with the state and the franchise. If the daily stale bread and cookies dont make you cringe, the melted plastic in the broccoli cheddar soup will!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just the unlucky one but I just went there for the first time today and I'm very disappointed that my bread is so stale! Maybe when you get your sandwich toasted it's not that noticeable but I got a tuna not toasted and the bread is so stale I wish I had a longer lunch I would go back and demand a new sandwich with fresh bread. Very disappointed:(."}
{"text":"This location doesn't partake in offers or promotions through the subway text services. The guy who made the sub had a great attitude and was friendly the whole time. But when it came to ringing up the order there wasn't a way for him to put in the promo. I think he did a good job and I'm not at all blaming him. I'm disappointed that the management doesn't educate their employees on current running promotions and how to ring them in. I'm assuming the lady who was sitting down with her laptop out who was watching everything was the regional manager and she didn't even step in or try to help him out. She just allowed a customer to walk out unsatisfied. I've came to this location a few times now and had a bad experience every time whether it was attitude from employees or unsanitary preparation of the food. I only go to this location because it's close to my house but now I would rather take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"best news never regaring this subway..it is now closed. As in GONE  Advised by another subway franchise owner that he shut her down. PTL"}
{"text":"The only time I come here is if I'm really intoxicated and have the drunk munchies, since my decision is normally impaired I normally get a foot Long instead of a six-inch, I went at about 4 AM today after a night of drinking and ate half of my sub, I put the other half in my refrigerator to save for when I wake up, once I was sober (about 11 am same day) oh my God the turkey on the sandwich tasted so gross and processed! Worst 8 dollar Mistake made in awhile. I'm deathly going to make sure I go to my regular Italian deli that has good ingredients, I feel kind of weird supporting Subway after the whole Jared thing anyways. It really is overpriced for the quality of food. $8 for a sub that has turkey, cheese and lettuce that doesn't even taste good unless your blitzed is expensive for fast food lol. The turkey tastes so gross I took a couple of bites out of the remaining half of my footling and can't take it anymore lol. I don't even want to give this turkey to my dog haha. I should of waited a couple hours for a deli to open because this was really really expensive for something really really gross lol. I think I could've had a better turkey sandwich for cheaper over at the airport at one of those little news stands that have sandwiches for sale lol"}
{"text":"They don't have the usual great subway service that you would expect from a subway. Ive been in multiple tines and employees have not had a uniform. No great and they are mean when attend to you. I recommend the service at jersey mikes better."}
{"text":"I've charged for double meat when I just had a meat substitution twice. A friend said it happened to them too, maybe they regular do this the make a few extra bucks. Other then that is a regular subway, exactly what you would expect. I recommend going to  the one on 117th."}
{"text":"Healthy affordable fresh sandwiches. I used to eat here on a regular basis. Monday thru Friday avoid noon long line"}
{"text":"I frequent this particular Subway for a variety of different reasons.  For starters, I work at the Arizona Center, so its right in my area for a quick lunch when I am starving.

I'm not a fan of Subway's in general.  I don't think thier food is that good, and I've found other alternatives to them to eat healthy if I choose.

There is usually quite a line when you walk in, only because a lot of us take lunch hour at the same times here. The location is usually neat and clean, and the staff here is okay at best.  Menu is self explanitory, and seating is ample, inside or out."}
{"text":"What can I say, this is a normal Subway chain. Same menu, same ingredients, same look, etc. 

Since I work in the area, Subway has become a normal stop for me to get my lunches. I look for a place that is quick yet somewhat healthier. Subway offers that for me. I can add whatever I want to my sandwiches without wondering how much junk is in it. 

I usually do the 6\" of the day except for Tuna. Spicy Italian is my favorite. Bread is always freshly cooked and the meat and veggies are always fresh and crispy. If they don't add enough of something, just ask them to add extra. Absolutely no complaints with the food. 

The workers here are very nice and friendly. The store is clean whenever I've been there. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I come here often as I work close by and can just walk here and eat within my 30 minute lunch break. 

It's a typical Subway with all the same options as all others. But what I think makes this place nice, is the people. They are always nice and friendly and do their best to make your sandwich the way you want it. My favorite sandwich is the Spicy Italian, but do enjoy others..minus the Tuna one. Veggies, meats and cheese are always fresh. 

Everytime I've been here, the place is clean. They make sure the tables are cleaned off, the floors swept and trash cans empty. Nothing like coming into a place and being disgusted by a dirty table or trash and food on the floor. So, Thank you Subway for making sure your place is clean!"}
{"text":"One of the nicest and cleanest locations I've been to. This location is just 8 minutes walking distance from my house and so it's very convenient for me, but for some reason, it's taken forever to visit this location. 

As you enter you are greeted by a very friendly face. Since I already knew what I wanted, I ordered right away. The guy making my sub was very attentive to my particular wants. He was efficient and quick. When making my sub he didn't skimp on ingredients like many other places do and he was kind enough to add extra when I asked for it. 

All the ingredients were fresh and didn't look as though they had been sitting out for a long time. The lettuce in particular didn't have any brown piece in it which I was very thankful for. 

The inside was super clean. All tables were wiped down and the floor was swept and clean. The inside looked like this place just opened up for business. Everything was perfect. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Not much to say about Subway, as they all are pretty much the same, with the same sandwiches, same specials, and the same decor inside but since I usually eat at a Subway 5 days at of the week when I'm at work, I usually come to the same few and the employees are very nice to me. I've never had a bad experience here and the food is always fresh. 

I usually come in early, around 9ish in the morning, so the place is usually very clean, the trash is empty, the restroom is clean and stocked, the bread is freshly made, the veggies/meats/cheeses all look fresh and the employees are all in a good mood. 

Will come back again."}
{"text":"I came here at about 730 PM on a Saturday night. I ordered an Egg and Cheese which was awesome and only 174 calories! I also ordered the Broccoli Cheese soup which was...awful. It tasted like it had been heated too high and the milk spoiled. Service was good. Their bathroom was super gross. Nobody bothered us when we sat and talked for about an hour- felt comfortable and safe. Not my BEST subway experience, but not my worst."}
{"text":"I often duck in here for a salad when I'm looking for a light lunch, and although Subway may not be the most exciting selection, I can get a salad of my choice, with a ton of vegetables for around 10$.

The staff is always friendly and make a point of getting my order just the way I like it. I can recommend this location if you're a subway fan."}
{"text":"I've been to this Subway many times and the service is usually quick and the sandwich artists here are good at making sammies they way you want them. They usually are staffed to handle crowds and the line moves along pretty steadily. I love the rye bread. I'm addicted to the turkey sub on rye. Please don't get rid of the rye bread! I usually love all the veggies on the sub and I love to watch the sandwich artist try and capture all of the veggies into the bread at the end of the line. They get so distraught when the veggies start to slide out of the bread when they fold it over. Hilarious! This location is right off the bike path (bike rack outside) and super assessible from PD.  A perfect location to pick up a sandwich and a beverage to go from Barriques next door. Easiest dinner done in a couple of minutes on the way home from work!"}

 Will try to be back.

Thank you"}
{"text":"Someone from Management needs to contact me ASAP about the service I received from the employee Elijah at the Galleria Blvd Location in Charlotte, NC.  

When I went to pay for my food, I laid a $20 bill on the counter.  He looked at me and asked....\"Have you ever worked in a restaurant before?\"   If yes, is this \"how you pay for your stuff\".   I said \"Yes, it is...why?\"   He proceeded to tell me that \"that is not cool...and it's disrespectful\".  I then told him that correcting a paying customer on how the proceed with a business transaction is rude and disrespectful.  He then proceeded to tell me it was like \"him throwing my sandwich and chips at me instead of handing it to me\".  THEN HE PROCEEDED TO THROW A BAG OF CHIPS AT ME.   

Instead of letting things get more heated....I just walked out.   All this was happening in at the same time another employee was sitting to the side and eating her lunch. 

Now, I'm not a disrespect person....and I truly try to find the best in people.....but Elijah just showed out for no reason.  Perhaps it was a bad day.....or whatever....but he cost the company a sale and is detering a repeat customer.

This is not how you treat a customer.  Especially a 40 year old man.....coming from a 17 year old kid.

I would like for someone to contact me."}
{"text":"We have used Subway in multiple cities where we live as a great 'quick lunch' alternative. This location is always fast and efficient. We ordered and paid for 3 sandwiches on line and we were quoted about 20 minutes. They were ready in 5 and tasted great. Staff well trained. Great job!"}

She needs to change her ways or she has to go."}
{"text":"as people said below, 1 star for poor customer service. manager needs to be fired because he obviously doesn't understand he's in a service industry.  out of forks, who runs out of forks at a restaurant? out of ice \"it's automatic so if we're out we're out\" so go grab some from the back or send an employee to go get ice. groups of people complaining about no ice, and manager did nothing about it. owner, fire your manager asap, I will never be back here. there's plenty of subways.  Saturday about 130pm."}
{"text":"Was barked at by female employee because I followed their posted instructions with regard to presenting coupon prior to ordering. Restaurant was clean but the floors were freshly mopped with over half of the tables with their chairs.  Appearing that they were closed or closing. Bad optics. Patricia became a little friendlier after she overheard us complaining about the attitude we were given upon entering."}
{"text":"We started going to this location because the one nearer to us on Pinnacle Peak at about 3700W got so bad. At first it was night and day. The staff was friendly and the subs were plentiful with both meats and veggies. Unfortunately we'll now have to look elsewhere. My wife and I both got a sandwich, hers a 6\" and mine a footlong. The rotisserie chicken of hers lacked chicken about the last 2\", so in essence a 4\" sub. Mine about the same on both sides, so a 8\" sub. The layering of tuna so thin it really couldn't be tasted. I know Subway owners are in a huff about corporate pricing, but this was our last visit here. Too bad, I guess some profit is worse than no profit. Good luck keeping this one up and running."}
{"text":"This Subway is one of the only completely Kosher Subways in the USA.  It's inside the Mandel Community Center.  I do not keep Kosher, so it's rather different than what I'm used to.  
The menu is very small.  Staff is nice.   I still prefer regular Subways, though.  I don't like the fake cheese here.  If you keep Kosher, you will likely be pleased."}
{"text":"This review is about the service, not the food. The food was very fresh today but the service was annoying.  I appreciate good customer service but when they push you to add bacon or avocado or anything you don't want, they need to take \"no thank you\" as the answer.  Instead they kept pushing. I felt like I was at one of those pushy car washes where they continuously try to up sell you.  I appreciate asking if I want something but if I say no thank you, please let it go.   I will probably avoid this location moving forward."}
{"text":"It's subway, so keep in mind that their may be corporate standards to uphold, the staff ultimately makes or break the experience, if the food comes out okay. And at this spot, the staff was actually really cool. But the bread was so dry! Maybe they are leaving it in the oven too long?? 

I had the sub of the day which was turkey, on wheat. Got it with pepper jack and had them toast it.  Finished it off with olives, cucumber, bell peppers, jalapeños, pickles, creamy sriracha, oil vinegar with oregano & salt n pepper. Came out decent minus the incredible dry-mouth producing effect their bread had on my salivary glands. 

4 stars for such a positive environment"}
{"text":"Just bought a sandwich to go at 11:30AM. I am certain it was yesterday's bread as it is dry and stale."}
{"text":"Holy wow I am blown away. So I order subway all of the time, probably too much. I have never had a sandwich this good. I ordered a standard turkey sandwich with veggies and got it panini grilled. When Ivan hands me the sandwich it is this beautiful crispy brown sandwich with everything perfectly in place and nothing falling out. Keep in mind there was a LOT of veggies in the sandwich and usually when I get it panini grilled at other subways it falls apart. This wasn't the case with Ivan the panini master. The bread was perfectly toasty and I could go on and on about how satisfied I am. All I'm trying to say here is Ivan is the best and my sandwich was awesome."}
{"text":"I normally love a trip to subway, but will never return to this location.... Ever! Although the food is good and the place is clean. The female manager awful. I never experienced any problems here until the day she came out and said I can't have lots of jalapenos. 

She seems to think she can limit how many jalapenos I should have mysub for me to be able to enjoy it. I offered to pay extra fir the extra toppings.  So clearly it was not about me abusing the free extra toppings. She just simply did not think I should have that many on my sub. Who is she to think thats even appropriate. You lost a customer for life at this store."}
{"text":"Love to eat here. Something about sandwiches that always fill you up. They are simple and easy to make yet often you prefer somebody else to make me for you. 

I found that they do a great job here. The food tast great,  lots of selections and topping.  The food servers are happy and helpful. And if you want lots of something.  They are more then happy to add more, free of charge. Well with the exceptions of meat and guacamole.

I be returning to this place as long as they continue the good work."}
{"text":"First and foremost the this subway, at lest when I was here, had wonderful service. Very friendly and helpful.  

Like most subways they had many choices of bread, meats, cheeses and vegetables.  Not to mention the many types of sauce one has to choose from. To top it off they even have pizza. 

Every was fresh, no little fly's buzzing around. Everything was clean."}
{"text":"At midnight when you are hungry nothing is better than subways.  The guy was fast and polite..."}
{"text":"First of all, I know. This is Subway and it's weird to write a review. However, the experience last night was SO BAD that it had to be written.

Went for a quick lazy Sunday sandwich pickup last night. 2 young girls were working and seemed friendly. They were having issues with the toaster oven and several people were already waiting ahead of us for toasting purposes. Cold sandwich? Eh, better than waiting. So they started the process with us. 

I asked for \"a turkey sandwich on wheat\". The first girl misunderstood me THREE TIMES in thinking I said I wanted \"8 turkey sandwiches on wheat \". Not sure what part of my 2 person, yoga pants, let-me-get-back-to-netflix aura made her think I'd want to cater a party. Once it was established that I wanted just 1 sandwich, she moved forward in the slowest meat/cheese/veggies assembly imaginable. 

Asked for spinach. Received 4 carefully placed spinach leaves. Asked for more, she literally placed 2 more. On a foot long sandwich. Same with peppers and tomatos. At this point, thinking a veggie shortage must be happening, I asked for a shake of salt and pepper and moved to the payment area. During this whole time, several people were getting angry about the girls not knowing how to reset the oven. For whatever reason, they kept taking orders for hot sandwiches and only THEN telling the customers about the oven and the long queue waiting. Not sure how that turned out.

A very disturbing observation: Yes, they wore gloves. No, they never took them off. For anything. The girls used the gloves to push buttons on the oven, to process payment, everything. There really isn't a point to wearing them if you touch everything with them. 

Finally home, my husband and I happily sit down to continue our Community binge watching session with some mediocre sandwiches to round out the weekend. First bite...AHHHHH! This girl had literally put so much salt and pepper on our sandwiches that there was a visible layer of black among the veggies. I know that I didn't watch while she added this since I was getting ready to pay, but no one expects more than a quick shake. This was enough to season meat for a full meal for 8 people. Literally could taste nothing but salt and pepper. 

If the employees had seemed competent, we would have taken the subs back and just asked for a refund. We knew this was not the case (there was no manager there either) and that we'd be met with blank stares, so we just threw them away. Such a waste of time.

Moral of the story: Don't go to this Subway unless your taste buds are dead."}
{"text":"So the three women working here make all the difference. I was greeted with three huge smiles and was told jokes all the while I was picking out sandwich stuff. As I was paying the only thing I could think was \"Man, I wish I had these three girls running my business.\" Subway- bad luck with Jarred but if you ever need three new spokeswomen, find out whoever was working here today at 1pm."}
{"text":"I feel bad writing a negative review but the employee who made my sandwiches I had to correct almost every time he went to get something . He'd ask what cheese and I'd say what I wanted and he would reach for the total opposite cheese and I'd say no I actually wanted Swiss . I was trying to be a nice a possible but after the 4th time I was about to walk out and go to another place for lunch . There was no language issue and I wasn't speaking softly so I'm not sure what the issue is . Hopefully next time it will be better"}
{"text":"Great subway, very clean and well-kept, polite and friendly staff. We were greeted as soon as we walked in. We also were told immediately the toaster was not working. Ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"This subway is OK.

No one greeted us when we walked in. Last time I came here food was good, and ingredients were fresh. However, I was disappointed that they won't tell their guests when they are out of popular ingredients. We ended up waiting in line for 10 minutes only to go to another Subway."}
{"text":"I actually didn't like my sub TBH.  I wasn't hungry tho, just bored enough to buy food.  Service was friendly and prompt though.  Subway is p boring compared to my usual diet, but I have no real complaints with this fine establishment :D"}
{"text":"Subway is... well, Subway. It lived up to the expectations set but wasn't anything overwhelmingly special. 

The location is in a kind of sketchy area in a random, dingy looking shopping complex. Inside is decently clean and the staff was nice. 

Sandwiches were Subway typical - so, they were good."}
{"text":"Absolutely love my BMT. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. I always get triple pepperoncinis and they were more than happy to accommodate me. Food is fresh, bread is nice and luscious, meats and veggies are always fresh. I especially like that they also serve lettuce. Most subways have taken out the lettuce and switched it with spinach, which is okay with me, I like spinach, but it was nice to see the lettuce there for people who may not care for spinach. There cookiecase is always full of fresh baked cookies, which is nice. A great place with easy parking to get a nice sandwich for a reasonable amount of money."}
{"text":"This subway is amazing! Great service! Amazing food! & Always Clean! Especially The Kid named Cesar and The Asian kid with the blonde streak!! I love subway!"}
{"text":"The toilet here is disgusting. I almost lost my appetite after using the women's restroom.

This Subway has NOT been closed as may have been reported by other Yelpers (I was just there on Friday), but may be it should be."}
{"text":"I reported to them there was a blond hair in tuna container. The rude owner storms out of the store to tell me i was lying. And his video system can detect hair. It told him if it detects hair then it should have detected that blond hair then. I also asked him if it detected the dirty nose of one of his employees. He is a total jerk. He is so rude to his staff. Always disrespects then in front of customers. In addition to being rude to female customers."}
{"text":"I ordered a regular meal, and they charged me for a large drink. Gave me change to cover the difference, but it felt like a very shady situation, and he didn't prove the amount was correct. I really like Subway but won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"I just had the best service at a subway in my whole life. Alex the manager had a super positive attitude, was customer orientated, and was making us laugh the whole way through the line. This is definitely the type of manager I would hire to keep customers coming back."}
{"text":"Heather, one of the associates here is the main reason I come to this location. There are others closer to my house, but I really love the service I get here! She is always in a good mood and makes an effort to conversate with you. She is definitely going to (if she hasn't already) make this place a LOT of money!!!"}
{"text":"This is not really a review of Subway, as Subway in itself is disgusting. Why anyone thinks over-processed luncheon meat is good is beyond me. Actually Subway found a way to make things even worse. They used to sell fresh avocado on the sandwich. Now, they use a disgusting, bland green glop that resembles guacamole but tastes worse than Elmer's Glue. Have you ever noticed the odd smell that accompanies a Subway?

Anyway, this review is specifically about this location. To the short, fat ugly employee that works here around noon - lose the attitude. It makes the experience even worse than it is. It is not mine, or anyone else's fault that you look like you do, and the universe has set your employment at a Subway in the heart of ASU. Its not our fault that your days are spent serving some of the hottest girls on the planet while they ignore your questions and continue to text on their iphones. They are busy, planning their photo shoots for Playboy and their weekends in Vegas.

Unfortunately this is where you are at this point in your life, so get over it. Serve the incredibly hot Delta Gamma's and chubby Delta Theta's. Don't put so much mayo on my 6\" roast beef and move on. We can make this whole experience so much better without the attitude."}
{"text":"Was very happy with the service provided by John. He showed me the herb bread, as I had asked if I could see what it looked like before I chose.  He answered my questions and helped me through this, as I had only been to Subway once before and it had been years.  He made a great looking and great tasting sandwich.  Husband also got a great sandwich but, he has been several times before.  We will both come again.  Great sandwiches.  We really enjoyed then.  The place is clean and inviting and the help was friendly and professional.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"D'une franchise on ne peut pas être déçu des aliments dans la mesure que tout est régit par la maison-mère. Par contre, le service est ce qui retient notre attention.

Les deux commis ont rit voyant mon malaise de les déranger , mais ne parlaient pas  français lorsqu'ils se sont adressés à moi ; j'ai quitté.  J'ai définitivement un mauvais caractère ... ;-)."}
{"text":"Can sum up the staff experience in one word: Attitude. If allowed two words: Sucky attitude. Serious training issues here. Not hostile so much as completely apathetic. Wish I got the guy's name before he packed up and left. It was 9:30 am, so he must have been the night staff. 

Every table was dirty. He must never get out from behind the counter. Although, there were only three customers there, myself included. Given how slow he moved, I can only guess at what he does between customers. It ain't his job, obviously.

Here is what frustrated me so much:

My husband and I arrived. Together. Greasy counter guy was wrapping up with the only customer. I headed to the bathroom. Did what needed done, washed up, headed out. He was still ringing up the same customer.  Had not even acknowledged my husband standing there all that time. Didn't even glance at us. Finally finished with only other customer, shuffled over to my husband. Asked what he wanted, what bread, which type of eggs, etc. Starts building sandwich. I say, nicely, \"We're together.\" Usually when you are in a group, they take care of you all at once. I've been to dozens of Subways, it's not rocket science.

He looks at me as if I had just materialized and grunts in my direction - no eye contact, just a grunt. Cuts bread. Gets out container of eggs, takes off lid,  takes out eggs, puts on sandwich, puts lid back on, puts eggs away, continues. 

I repeat that we are together, adding that I was going to get a breakfast sandwich, too. He was visibly upset that I deigned to speak to him. Now I'm angry. \"So, what I'm saying is that you'll have to get the eggs out again. You might as well make them together, save yourself some time. At least, you could have, if you'd listen to me, the customer. Over here. Hello?\"

He snarked back something unintelligible, but definitely snarky. Still no eye contact. Still didn't start on my food. Wrapped up hubby's, went to cash register. Got even more upset when he found out that he'd have to make mine, too, before ringing us up.

Halfway through my breakfast fixings (open fridge, get container of eggs, take off lid, etc...) he is relieved by the next shift. She's all smiles and efficiency. He slinks off - after preparing HIS OWN SANDWICH FIRST! We're still waiting. It is only after he has left that we finally get our breakfasts completed and rung up.

Then, we had to clean off a table in order to sit down to eat.

I get it, you're not a morning person. Not my problem. Buck up, kiddo - you can always work at the DMV."}
{"text":"The worst Subway! Went in at 8:30pm and as sub was being made employee David turned off sign and was closing already. Spoke with David as to who franchise owner was. Owner is Raj store manager Kathy.  Too much trouble to make more marinara. Found out from Subway at Stapley and McKellips it takes a whole 2 minutes tops. FYI go the extra distance it's better. Website reads closes at 9:30 it was cleared and closes at 9:10pm. I took pictures. Not worth your money as staff is untrained by management and possibly owner. Not Subway standards very poor quality. Second time I walked out and my adult kids will not go again. Go to Stapley and McKellips."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on apple pay vs subway app. I didn't have my wallet today so I searched for places that took apple pay. Google said McDonald's and subway where fast to jump on board Apple pay so I went in. I first asked cashier if they took it, he said no after some confusion and lack of English skills. They have only a subway app. So I signed up for app and input my card and proceeded to order. The app said to scan the qr code the cashier would give me but the cashier rep was clueless and said they don't have scanner. It did not work even though all the verbiage on the signs promoting pay by app. Horrible. Get with the times."}
{"text":"Me, reviewing a Subway? Weird, I know. I wouldn't do so unless it was either amazing (not gonna happen) or something bothered me.

Every other time I come here, they're out of something I want. Oh, there's a special on meatball subs? They're out of that. I want a bread besides white or wheat? Usually gone. Do I just have bad luck? 

This place is clean, but I don't like some of the workers (pay attention to me, old guy!) and I don't like the management. Not that I met them, but...

...I get coupons mailed to me. This, I believe is the closest Subway. Why, then, do you not accept coupons? Are you that ghetto? I guess this is the Maryvale area. I'll probably be back out of sheer convenience in my commute, but I sure do have an axe to grind with your service. There are too many of your generic shops out here. You are extraneous."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Her name is Jamie. Very very rude. Asked for a cup of water which made her mad ! She said I have to buy a empty cup for $3 !!! Truly what she was thinking ??? Never has this rude subway employee. Management should do something about it. But I guess you have to judge other reviews as well."}
{"text":"Some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced.

Firstly, no one ever bothered to greet me when I had walked into the establishment.

I then sat down to connect to Time-Warner Cable's Wi-Fi hot-spot -- since this franchise didn't offer a free, public one -- to check my text and e-mail offers from Subway.

Before long, the staff started playing hip-hop music as if no one else was there to hear it. I didn't mind that, per se, but it made me feel invisible. Moreover, it's un-professional to start playing Lil' Wayne as if you've locked the doors and are in cleaning mode for the night! One, obnoxious employee just kept spouting to her coworker(s): \"I told her, 'That's my girl!'\" Clearly, the staff had already clocked out mentally for the night, because -- after I had walked up to the deli counter -- a curly-haired woman eventually sauntered over, put on some gloves, and stared out the window to her left the entire time, never bothering to welcome me, or ask me how I was, or ask me what I wanted to order.

I said, \"I would like to order a six-inch turkey breast, please,\" to which she made no comment. Because I had encountered a previous issue with another employee at this restaurant not knowing how to process a legitimate, paper, Subway coupon and her pretending to call her boss to explain to her how to do it only for her to reject my coupon ultimately, I showed the woman the QR coupon code from Subway on my mobile device and asked, \"Do you guys accept this?\"

\"No,\" she replied. Not, \"Let's see if it will scan at the register,\" or, \"Let me ask my coworker,\" or, \"Let me take a closer look,\" or even, \"I'm sorry, but this location doesn't accept coupons,\" just a flat, lifeless, definitive \"no.\" What a positively un-helpful and discourteous demeanor!

What's more, homeless people are always hanging around outside.

Unless you like terrible, customer (dis)service; don't like saving money; and want to risk getting jumped; avoid this location at all costs!

May 2018 update: against better judgment, I decided to stop by after my shift. A customer had just walked out with a sandwich. It was about a quarter 'til the store was set to close.

As soon as I walked in, a rude, female employee stated: \"We're closed.\" I had to do a double-take and look at the sign. Sure enough, it said that they shouldn't have \"closed\" until 9 p.m., not 8:47 p.m.! Why turn away business? Obviously, these employees were in a hurry to leave. That's okay, because I'll never think twice about giving them my business again!"}
{"text":"Standing in line. Waiting for a sandwich. Two teenager reps on shift. Notice I didn't say working. 
One steps away from counter with three customers in line and starts texting on her phone. 

TEXTING WHILE CUSTOMERS ARE IN LINE. Unbelievable. I went to Great Harvest next door. They're AWESOME."}

Came in at lunch time and there were a couple people but the line moved quickly. Everyone was very kind and helpful and my sandwiches were made as desired. No complaints. I would definitely come back here again.
There is no wifi but I was able to connect to Arby's next door. Why does Arby's have wifi?"}
{"text":"This Subway has a drive-thru, which I thought AWESOME, until I opened up my sandwich at work. It was smashed, poorly put together, veggies everywhere, soggy. It was disgusting. I had been on a Subway streak for almost a week and this sandwich put that to a dead stop. I couldn't eat Subway for another month. Bottom line, you have to watch the person physically make your sandwich because otherwise you get something completely inedible."}
{"text":"What sets this Subway apart from other Subways? They fry you fresh eggs for your breakfast sandwiches. WHAT?! That's a win."}
{"text":"This Subway is great! Usually you get employees who seem like they've spent a little too much time in the back smoking pot, but the staff here is always upbeat and friendly.  The guy always asks me if I need my sandwich cut or wrapped in any special way.  You always get a very well put together sandwich."}
{"text":"Like all 'chains' they can vary from location to location.. But I've been in this one a few times now, and the food is consistently fresh, veggies crisp, meat in great condition - hence the subs turn out really well... recommended."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Subways I have ever been to. The shop is very big, comparatively, they have two sandwich making lines, awesome for when it's busy, and they have flat screen TVs which are great for when I am on my lunch break and want to catch up on the world happenings. 

Very clean and the staff is friendly and make a great sandwich!"}
{"text":"Well depending on which day you go, youll have a very different experience. One day, I told them I was in a hurry but the manager felt a need to give me a brand new employee. 
I was as understanding as possible but I could tell another customer was using their smart phone to film my reaction. I felt sad about this considering how hard I tried to be nice and how horrible the service was. 
I stuck it out anyway and paid for the subs to be nice but i was not treated nice by the staff or tge other customers. When I left I pretty much just wished I just left empty handed."}
{"text":"Nathan served me today, he was great!! Made my subs just as I asked & offered deluxe. Very friendly too. Outside light was not turned on, it was dark so I had to search for the place since I am not from this area. He thanked me for letting him know and made sure it was turned on as soon as he was done with my order."}
{"text":"It's subway. You know what subway has. Nothing exceptional. Not filthy. Don't load your sandwich with dressing because it's bad for you."}
{"text":"It's Saturday night & both my husband & I had a long day at work. Not knowing what to have for dinner decided to go with Subway. Junk food crossed our minds several times but we decide to go with a healthier decision. TYLER made our Subs exactly how we wanted them! He was so nice & has EXCELLENT customer service skills! We will defenetly be returning to Subway!"}
{"text":"I am rating this 3 stars because the guy that made my sandwich was very nice, quick, and polite. He gets 5 stars. However, the girl at the register, I believe her name is Kyanna (thats the name on my receipt) gets 0 stars. I was wearing a Diamondbacks shirt and as I was running my credit card she muttered something under her breath and then said \"The Diamondbacks suck too\". I was a little taken back so I just said, \"ok\" and then she told me that she \"makes her opinions known\". Ok, I am not usually one to complain because I have worked in food for many years but that was just rude. Hate on the Diamondbacks all you want but when you are at work, you probably shouldn't tell your customers that the shirt they are wearing \"sucks\" and you should probably keep your opinion to yourself if you can't say something nice. It was just rude and totally uncalled for. She needs a lesson in customer service, thats for sure."}
{"text":"What great customer service the two people working had! They were super busy and didn't miss a beat. Both of them were friendly and upbeat."}
{"text":"This Subway is absolutely terrible.  I like subway and it's food in general, but this branch is completely ruined by absolutely terrible service and quite possibly the worst employees I've ever seen at a food establishment.

Now, I've been here about 20-25 times since it's only a block away from my work (and it's one of the healthiest things to grab nearby), and the same damn issues are present every single time.  I've now stopped going completely since I can't stand this branch.

First off, they are always out of ingredients or bread.  I usually get the chicken breast foot long sub.  There had to be at least 10 occasions I went and they had no chicken breasts.  It's also not uncommon for them to be out of bread, and common ones too.  No wheat, no Italian?  There's been a few instances where all they had left was something obscure like Monterery Cheddar, and this isn't some off hour.  Its usually right during lunch!   I can understand once or twice, but you think they would take action to stop this from happening since it seems to happen ALL THE TIME?  Anybody ever think to make more bread???

They have been out of tomatoes, out of peppers, onions out of cucumbers... It's ridiculous.  The worst part is they act rude instead of apologetic.  \"WE DONT HAVE THAT...\"  ok.... no need to yell at me there.... 

Honestly though, the worst part are the employees.  It's been the same 4 people every time I go.  The least worse of the bunch is the manager.  She is an older lady, and while generally nice, there have been days where she has been outwardly disgruntled, and talked to customers rudely, looking as she was almost ready to snap, but usually she is able to keep it shelled in... The other employees, *sigh...

There's two younger girls who work there.  They have never been rude, but they work extremely lethargically.  They often keep asking what you want, and take a long time to put your sub together.  They really need to pep up, because they just act like it's killing them to be there...  Maybe it is killing them, but you work a customer service job, you got to perk up!

The last employee that works there is a young male and he appalls me every single time with his actions.  I really have no idea how he still has a job.  His behavior is ridiculous. He is probably, and consistently, the most disgruntled employee in the entire world...

 He throws sandwiches together like they were no better than mush.  He doesn't change his gloves often so I have had far too many sandwiches with buffalo chicken sauce, oriental sauce, etc etc on my sandwich.... Yea, big no no.  Thank god I don't have allergies, but hot buffalo chicken sauce definitely does not taste any what appetizing smeared all over my cold cut either...

It  doesn't stop there.  He rants about his job to every single customer.  No one even asks him, yet he is constantly letting you know how badly his job sucks and how he can't handle it.  It's like sheesh man, we all worked crappy jobs at some point, but that attitude sure isn't going to get you anywhere....  

It's not even something like a dreary \"Man, I'm having a rough day...\"  It's more like a resentful \"God! why do so many damn people have to come in, I can't believe this shit... AGHH KILLLLL MEEEE PLEASE.\"

No lie people.... that is what he does, and that is why I get so bothered by it.  In some ways, he acts like so much of a trainwreck it's almost amusing to watch his anger grow.  I've had my fair share of watching him throw stuff, bang his head off a wall, and even once scream \"F*** my life!!!!\" during the middle of making a sub after he dropped the bun on the floor.  Still, for as funny as it could be, it's just plain rude.  He has made fun of customers several times, and his constant whining gets on one's nerves way too easily.  He acts like he is the only one with problems in his life...

All and all, I love the Subway chain in general, but this branch has serious issues.  The service is terrible, and the staff is rude and downright horrendous with the way they act.  I still love Subway, but I will never go to this branch again."}
{"text":"Ok, OK, there is one of these practially on every block... So what is so special about this one. Since my kids love sandwiches, we have been to many of these and this one is great because:

Service - The manager and staff are pleasant, well trained, friendly and treat you like family.

Food - Come on, it is basically the same. I cannot compare.  But I will recommend that you use the Italian Herb and Cheese bread, have your sandwich toasted, and put all you want on it, but then use the spices, the sweet onion dressing, and oregano and you will be set!

Price - Like all the subways, reasonable.

What really makes this place is that the service is just phenomenal.

Check it out!"}
{"text":"The team here is efficient and very very professional!  This is a great place.

1.  Location - Southwest corner of Trop and Pecos, very easy to get to.

2.  Parking - Not much, perhaps a total of 10 spaces for three stores there.

3.  Ambiance - A typical Subway.

4.  Food choices - A typical Subway, with all the normal meats, cheeses and veggies

5.  Not Typical - What sets this place apart is the quality service.  Just three days ago, I was at another Subway in Henderson ordering a sandwich platter for a meeting and so I have something recent to compare:

a.  Meats - I think they are controlled by this, so nothing special.
b.  Veggies - They really packed these on. Compared to the Henderson one, they went all out.
c.  Service - I was there at 11:15 and one person was before me. When I ordered the platter which is 5 sandwiches,  Then, 5 people came in immediately after me, so they had a very busy time. Immediately two others came out of the back and started helping all the other clients. Excellent way to manage client expectations and a busy load. 
d.  More - They even asked me if I wanted another sandwich for 5.00 more as it will pack the tray that is reserved for the mustard and mayo packs. I did do this and it rounded out the platter nicely.  At the henderson Store, they did not ask and I did not know and the tray looked a bit empty to me and not a nice way to impress the meeting.


6.  Overall - The service here for a chain was tremendous. I recommend this place!

GK says check it out."}
{"text":"Nothing out of the ordinary, just your average Subway. What makes me enjoy going there is that it's cheaper and more fresh than anything at the food court across the street. Especially if you're you're getting \"sub of the day\". Can't go wrong with 4 dollars for a fresh half inch sub made right in front of you!"}
{"text":"The previous review is no longer the case as I just came here this weekend and ordered a cold cut combo with chips and drink combo and it was $8.00 and change. There was definitely no $14 sub. This place was full of Wendy's, Weinershnitzel, Noble Roman's pizza, Del Taco, DQ/Orange Julius, Starbucks, Panda Express, etc. This was the best bargain place to eat on the strip for both calorie and $ watching. Im so glad this place had subway..:)"}
{"text":"this is the place to eat if you are at the outlet mall. thsi is probably the only healthy place to eat. we chose to split a 6\" sub so that we could save some calories for our dinner that night. She hooked it up and didnt skimp on veggies. I appreciate that. :)"}
{"text":"So the only advantage to this place is when the cashiers forget to charge you for the bacon you added on to your sandwich. Doesn't happen all the time but most of the time. They always have some ghetto ass people just hanging out in there. So it's usually a grab and go. People are always loud and I'm guessing that's why my \"sandwich\" artist, messes us my sandwich every time. I drive out of my way to avoid eating at this subway."}
{"text":"Not the greatest sandwich but I still enjoy it! The Italian herbs and cheese bread is really good as well as the chipotle southwest sauce, I always ask for extra! I normally get the chicken breast with provolone, cucumbers, bell peppers, tomatoes, and lettuce. It's my go to and its never let me down before!"}
{"text":"Expect your average Subway food. Today, I especially appreciated the employees. When my three year old needed to potty RIGHT NOW, an employee stopped what she was doing to unlock the restroom for us. In addition, my husband left his wallet here by accident. The employees kept it safe and even contacted AAA (my husbands card was in the wallet) and had them contact us to let us know the wallet had been found."}
{"text":"There is a guy that works here that makes the term sandwich artist actually mean something. He is the only reason I gave 2 stars and not one. There is a girl who i see here the other half of the time who is soooo over it. Like if the way she throws the sandwich together so quickly and haphazardly is enough to make you lose your appetite, and if it's not the look of the finished sandwich itself is. I actually feel kind of bad because I walked out today after she had made my sandwich and i just couldn't bring myself to pay for it. Subway is already shitty enough when they prepare your sandwich well."}
{"text":"I ran by this subway yesterday while running errands and felt so bad for one of the works that I had to write a review. A sweet, new worker was trying hard to make a sandwich for me. I was patient and polite. Then, the manager came out and just went off on him about how horribly he cut the bread and how he's not supposed to do that. One, he didn't deserve that and two, not in front of a customer. She took over and made my sandwiches and had him do veggies. Then, he went to ring me up. She absolutely went off on him about how he's not supposed to run the register, he's just veggies. She was also yelling at some guy named Michael about all of this. I kept telling him it was ok and felt terrible for how awful he was being treated. I kept trying to see the manager's name (started with a B), but she had it on the side of her hat as if to hide it. The food was fine but I don't appreciate watching managers belittle their employees. I hope that kid finds another job because that manager was just miserable."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how come some people have issues with this location. It's one of the fastest servings ones out there, plus they always get my order right when I'm at the drive thru, and I am meticulous with my orders."}
{"text":"Does anyone grow up and want to work at Subway..Likely not. But there is a fine line between disliking your job and making it obvious to others how much an inconvenience they are for coming into your shop and interrupting your smoke break. Case in point is this particular Subway location.

It is rarely if ever half filled. I have never seen anyone actually eat there but sometimes 2-3 people/families looking to take out. It is a small facility and they love playing Metallica there which I find both amusing and distasteful depending on my mood and who is there. 

The food thankfully is as fresh as Subway food can be and it is the only reason I put up with the amount of flak that the server gives off plus it is walking distance from my house. However as I drive by sometimes thinking to get Subway I have to consider whether I may be in too bad a mood and want to smack the guy for being an asshat.

This has happened three times..Once it is an anomaly, twice it is an occurrence, three times it is a pattern.....

I drive up and the 2 servers are standing the prerequisite 20 feet away from the door smoking..as there is no one inside the Subway store. I go in, the put out their cigarettes and follow me in. I wait as they wash their hands and then they put on gloves. I give my order which is usually Meatball Sub with Provolone Toasted..maybe Turkey with Lettuce, Pickles, Mustard ..See the gloves arent there to protect them from the food..the gloves are there to protect US from eating bad things. So when they go and touch EVERYTHING with the gloves on which has already been touched by everything else it is kind of \"why wear the gloves?\". 

A scratch on the arm here, a scratch on the face there, picking something off the food counter that's been sitting there for 2 hours......I really think the gloves are moot at this point. 

So you get 2 stars..1 for having decent food and 1 for not totally screwing up my meal and at least being polite if not obviously uncomfortable that you work at Subway."}
{"text":"They have raised prices twice this year.
If you eat there and then leave, be prepared to pack your own up.
The Owner is a real a@@"}
{"text":"Your typical, delicious smelling subway. There's not a ton of seating (or at least not compared to the other subways I've been to), but the one time I've dined in instead of getting it to go, it seemed that most people weren't staying in to eat. So it works."}
{"text":"Found hair in my sub. We're professional about it and refunded me. Nice and friendly staff"}
{"text":"I eat low carb so subway is a quick and easy lunch for me to grab. Normally I enjoy their salads but do not go here if that is what you are looking for. First off salads are a dollar more than sandwiches so we should be able to get more veggies since we're not getting bread. Well that is not how this place works. Their salads are small. They don't even fill the bowl up. It was more like a side salad than a meal. I was dinning in so I asked for a water cup. They said they were out of water cups and refused to give me a different cup to use. Needless to say I will never return to this subway!"}
{"text":"I walked in today to order my veggie sub and this young man Garth was behind the counter by himself for a small period of time.....pumping out subs for a long line of people.  He didn't skip a beat, had a smile, polite demeanor and friendliness under pressure, plus he was super cleanly.  Thank you Garth."}
{"text":"Agree with Bryan A.  This place needs a manager.  Sad.  Two young teenagers left there working alone.  The guy seemed to know what he was doing, however the gal working with him was totally useless.  She didn't know the menu, didn't know how to make a sub (BLT) and clearly didn't know how to use the cash register.  And one large fly buzzing around the meat and cheese station.  Ugh.  I'm done."}
{"text":"The subway team here is on point, always! They provide quick friendly service; the bread is always soft, and veggies are always super fresh and crisp! They never frown on my super weird requests! My go to!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, not bad for a quick meal on the go!

The place is clean, had good music on and it's in a good location."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are decent. Nothing special but they do the job. I would prefer to have either port of subs or Quiznos but they can't beat Subways specials. Once in awhile I have been able to receive Groupon offers for Quiznos but not often.

Like I said, the sandwiches are affordable at Subway and their decent. Another plus is that I have 2 of them just down the street so convenience is part of the review too."}
{"text":"For one of my first reviews I thought I'd start out with a basic food like a sandwich. This Subway is in a convenient location just down the street from Carolina Tire & Auto in Pineville. 

It a very clean place, easy to get in and get out. The staff is friendly and they are also still promoting the $5 buck 12 inch sub.

I just had the new meatball with pepperoni on parmasan cheese bread and had it toasted. For mainly fast food made fresh, it's really tasty. The bread is the key along with the meatballs. Very moist and delicious. The pepperoni is a new twist and compliments everything very well. 

Overall for $5 bucks and a sit down lunch it's a good deal."}
{"text":"Great Subway restaurant located near the harbour and Harbourfront Center. I recently ate here this past weekend, and the service was phenomenal. They gave me service with a smile, made my sandwich perfectly, and made sure it was right. The place was clean, and had a bathroom. Lines can get a little long, especially during lunch time and weekends, but this place is worth it with the service and the sandwiches made right."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best sandwich experience I have ever had. The culinary expertise displayed by the remarkably considerate and helpful staff is a memory I will take with me the rest of my life."}
{"text":"---This is for all Subway locations.---    You bastards!!!  

Why must you make it so difficult to make a simple, crappy sandwich?   

This is how it goes, \"I'd like a turkey on wheat.\" then they put on gloves and ask \"that was a what again?\"    Do they only hire \"short bus\" people? 

 Ingredients, yup they regularly screw that up too. Either a huge handful of onions, or peppers, enough to make you gag, or they may give you only a single piece of onion/peppers. As if to say \"I don't like my job, so now I'm going to ruin your sandwich so you can have a bad day too.\"    

Why Subway why must you hassle me every time I get a sandwich?"}
{"text":"I love Subway - they have tons of excellent dining options and are a nice break from all the fast food joints in the area. 

I went into this restaurant the other day for lunch with my girlfriend, though I'm not so sure I'll return to this particular restaurant. 

Obviously I was buying food for both my girlfriend and I, but it was pretty clear the cashier and sandwich maker didn't speak English as their first language. I had to repeat several parts of our orders, and the cashier rang up our sandwiches SEPARATELY, even though we were obviously together and I had clearly stated this fact. When I pointed this out, the cashier said something like \"I only rang you up for that one\" and didn't sound too sympathetic or caring. And believe me, when you have as much stuff as I do crammed in your pockets, pulling out that debit card multiple times IS a hassle.

Next time, I think I'll go the few extra miles to the Lake Mead Pkwy./Basic location."}
{"text":"Make sure you look at the veggies before you put them on your sandwhich...they aren't always fresh. I very much enjoy a good Sub every now and then. Where can you get it cheapest but at Subway, unless you make it yourself.

Subways menu is pretty straight forward. You basically pick your bread and meat to start and then they put the rest of the toppings on for you. You basically pay to have someone make you a sandwich. I'll admit that there bread is good so no complaints there. Most of the meat though is either like lunch meat like turkey, black forest ham and roast beef. The chicken is the only item that has some texture to it but you can purchase tastier chicken at the grocery store. 

The strips lay there appearing unappetizing already covered in the chosen sauce for your meal. That part kind of takes the fresh out of it right? I usually choose a Veggie Delight or I get the tuna. My normal fixins are spinach, tomato, green pepper, banana bell peppers, olives, cucumbers and lots of red onions. For sauce, i implore the italian, light mayo for tuna, and sometimes the southwest sauce. 

Subways prices are fair for the subs and i tend to take coupons on the days that they aren't advertising any $5 foot long. Who can pass up a buy one get one free sub!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived about 4:30 PM this afternoon.
Pleasant staff- who prepared our sandwiches fairly quickly.
Got two 6 \" Turkey & Ham subs with all the fixings. Both were fresh 'n tasty!
Remember to keep your receipt. Few coupons offered on it as well as if you take their survey , your receive promotional offers and a free cookie on your next visit.."}
{"text":"I normally do not take to social media but due to numerous breakdowns in service I have to. The location is great and the friendliness is good also. It's the accuracy and consistency of my orders that are letting me down. I've frequented this place numerous times and a simple substitute (no ham add turkey) has morphed from being able to be substituted to unable to be substituted to now being up-charged 30% percent the cost of the sandwich. When I approached the evening shift employee his response is \"yeah that's right\" I asked why hoping for clarity he says you changed meats. I asked if you can substitute and he stated initially yes then when I asked why I am being charged for it he stated no. It's just frustrating to go somewhere and not have competent service delivered every time"}
{"text":"Rude employee. No white bread available for 30-40 mins. Really???
Had to go to another location."}
{"text":"It's standard Subway fare, nothing you'll be craving as your last meal on this planet. However, the service which for the most part is quintessential-chain-store-rushed-an- impersonal often plumbs abysmal depths of rushed, impersonal and patently bored. The server has on occasions doled out condiments on my sandwich without my asking him to do so and been outright rude as well! This ain't no Eleven Madison Park. You get what you pay for.

p.s. Try their new BBQ Pork sub, it taste pretty good without the bbq sauce!"}
{"text":"Standard subway as far as options, but based on the look is the toppings, this is not a high volume locations.   Our sandwich maker didn't think anything of scraping the bottom of The bucket of chicken, an inch of broth and all, and slopping it on the bread to make a wet soggy mess.  I watched her do that and asked for chicken without the packing liquid, and she said that's how they keep it fresh. She begrudgingly grabbed fresh chicken, then asked if I wanted new bread too.  No, no I don't. I love wet soggy bread. 
Service is functional and friendly, but excruciatingly slow.  There could be a line to the door and they would still take 10 minutes to throw together a sandwich.  
But, we can't be too fussy up the hill."}
{"text":"My boyfriend just got the worst food poisoning from your Subway last night. He had the Rotisserie chicken and has been puking straight from 4-9am. We will never eat here again. Unfortunate because we live across the street. We've been trying to call you all morning and you don't answer your phones. It's pretty ridiculous. \"Eat Fresh\" more like \"Kill me now\""}
{"text":"This past weekend I went to this location and I don't know if the girls were over whelmed or just having a bad day because it was horrible. I ordered a chicken salad and there was no LETTUCE!!! Wtf. How do u get a salad with no lettece!!! It was cool tho I just wanted them to add some on top not even a remake but the girls ignored me for over 10mins until another customer said for them to take care of me first since she saw me waiting. Not to mention she didn't even enter the building until wayyyyyy later"}
{"text":"place is maintained clean. The quality of subs are really good. It has all the spanish staff so we had some confusion in our order but in the end it was all good. :). subway is always the life saviour with $5 subs."}
{"text":"so i'm kind of a subway snob. so with that in mind.....

the high school aged staff kinda drives me nuts. there is just a complete lack of organization in there. and not exactly the cleanest establishment. i walked out last time i was there because the kid made my salad without putting on gloves....

handling meats, veggies etc with out gloves. no thank you.

the manager just lets her staff run roughshot all over that place. 

thanks but no thanks.
I really think its the gloves thing that got me. everything else i could deal with but thats just tooo much for me."}
{"text":"Maggie is a CHAMP!!!

poor thing was there by herself with about 8 people in line all with super complicated orders, making last minute changes and all with multiple sandwich orders. she killed it. stayed calm greeted every person who came through the door and gave overall great service."}
{"text":"I have never in my entire life had such phenomenal service in any eating establishment! When we walked in, Alex greeted us with a big smile and willing attitude to serve us. He happily added all the ingredients my mother asked for, and commented \"we are here to make you happy.\" This blew us away, and then Alex's co-worker, a really nice young lady even added on to that which explains for their impressive customer service. We're only in the area for a staycation but we can't wait to come back and visit this amazing Subway! Thank you Alex!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in 5 years...now I remember why.  There is one person behind the counter and 7 people in line.  Is this a joke?

Never again."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for Subway in the Las Vegas Valley.  The super friendly staff are warm and welcoming as you walk through the door.  I had the privilege of meeting the owner/manager Jordan who is as professional as they come.  My personal favorite is the steak & egg breakfast sandwich with green peppers, black olives and tomatoes.  I'll toast it and top it off with some chipotle sauce and some ranch.  Yum!  I come here 3-4 times a week at all hours of the day or night.  Luckily for me, this location is open 24/7.  Say hello to Jordan the next time you dine here, and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I'm a regular check-in at a different subway, in fact I'm the Duke!  Obviously I know my way around the restaurant.  I ordered my regular foot long ham with Swiss.  The employee asked if I wanted it toasted, I said yes, he said no.  At first I thought it was a joke, so ami asked again adding Please.  He then informed me they were \"resetting the oven.\"  No big deal I thought.  Let me get a cup of broccoli cheddar.  \"We don't have any soup\" he said.

Ugh, at this point I gave him one last chance.  May I please have a chocolate chip cookie.  \"Nope, we don't have those either.\"

Seriously!?  You don't have a toaster, nor soup, nor any cookies?

I'm an avid Subway customer, in fact, I'm there more then any YELP review.  Check my stats, because I'll never come to this location again."}
{"text":"Came in on 06-30-16 at 9:20 to be told that I couldn't eat inside. They had all the chairs put up on the table. I asked if i could tale one down to eat because the store doesn't close till 11pm. He said that the dining is closed. How can that be when your store doesn't close till 11? Sounds like a bunch of lazy workers trying to clean up early. So now I'm eating outside on the bed of my truck."}
{"text":"I go to this store all the time and Its always clean and the food prep area always looks good and fresh.  The 2 girls I see during the day shift are always friendly and attentive. The speed of service is good."}
{"text":"This store has made a complete turn around. I come in quite frequently and noticed a whole new staff , they are all great, friendly.. The bread is always fresh and food looks good to.. The store is clean , its been busy at lunch lately and the staff move us all along in a timely manner.. Your manager in there is doing an outstanding job! Thank you! This is my Subway of choice.."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this subway for years and I think the last few months ownership or management has changed and not for the better.   The staff isnt trained very well on how to do their job.. will be going to another store from now on."}
{"text":"Well I must say, not the friendliest service I've ever received but not the worst. They're adequately staffed, I was served quickly, but my server seemed to care more about pulling his cell phone out of his pocket rather than making my sandwich. As far as food, it's your typical subway. Bread was fine. They even have Swiss cheese, which I've found isn't always the case at subway."}
{"text":"At least 10 tables for seating. Clean place. Friendly staff. Bottles of soda and fountain soda. 3 people working at 7pm. Line moves fast. Bread is fresh. No problems here."}
{"text":"My son bought us lunch today.  What a total waste of money!  The bread on all three subs was like three day old bread. I had a blt and it was the worst I have ever had. How can you screw up a blt. I asked for mustard because that is how I like it. Well the mustard tasted funky,  just not right. The whole sub was dry with no flavor.  My son had to drown his with Italian dressing in order to eat it. My husband's sub just kept falling apart due to the bread being so dry. 
Subway advertises Eat Fresh. Well if you want to eat fresh go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I work graveyards around the corner and this location is supposed to be 24 hours. Well they Lie!! Your overnight employee locked the doors and turned the lights off on me when I walked up! Terrible business and a prime example of false advertisement! Im defiantly going to better business bureau about this!! Screwed me out of dinner, thanks :("}
{"text":"Took forever in line two employees both slow. Then one can't work register. So had to wait longer for other employee who just ignored that we were ready to pay finally had to tell him now"}
{"text":"Forgot to pack a lunch earlier this week =(

When a coworker walked in with Subway from this particular location back to the office, the boss called it the walk of shame.  Why?

It's not particularly good at this location.  The bread is definitely not fresh meaning that if they have bread from the previous day, they will use it. The red onions are generally awesome in sandwiches, but they slice them way too thick to be enjoyable. This place is always busy at lunch so beware I guess. And my personal experience:

(Her reaching for ft long)
Me: \"No, I want only 6 in.
Her: \"Well, you said 1 ft.
Me: \"...Ok\"

I don't get it.  Even if I said 1 ft., who cares? I want 6 in. now. So she's showing me that she has the ability to use her two ears and parrot back what I said.  I wasn't pissed at all, but it was like, okay, nice. Now go back to making my 6 in. sandwich pls, tks!

Not gonna go here again, not bc of service but the food.

dmo out."}
{"text":"Me gusta el Subway que esta in la oficinia se llama Fifth-Third building.  Este review es para esa restaurante.  Nunca escribir in espanol... perdon mi espanol.  Tengo otra casas que necesito a decir ... pero voy a decir en Ingles:  Despite how badly me/we/all knock Subway, they do alright.  When I think of quick and cheap, I think Subway.  I think quick and cheap a lot.  It's funny how time can mend the heart.  I used to hate this place with a passion.

dmo out."}
{"text":"I tried to get subway while I was on break. One girl is at the cash register by herself and she tells me they ran out of bread. I see a full stack of bread in the corner (how does a sandwich place even run out of bread anyway). I didn't question her and get panda instead. As soon as I get my food I see another worker at subway helping a lady with her sandwich. In 5 minutes they somehow magically had bread. If you don't want to work, then maybe you shouldn't be working. Such gross customer service"}
{"text":"The dirtiest subway I have ever been in, not exaggerating.  

Blonde, with pineapple tattoo, is alway kind and upbeat.  In a positive voice she always asks \"how are you\"."}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't rate a Subway quite so high but this location has done a great job.

I came in here after a bunch of running around in the plaza. There were a few people in line but the staff did a good job of moving them along quickly. The guy who was making my sub, Matt, was quick and efficient. I didn't have to repeat ANY part of my order ONCE! That's my biggest pet peeve and this location didn't do it! Amazing.

I was pretty surprised at the care he took to put my sandwich together, but he didn't take forever (like another location does - they do a good job making your sub but it takes over 10 minutes to get ONE footlong sub without toasting). My sub didn't fall apart, it didn't ooze out the sides, very good job. Also, when I specify that I want \"a few\" pickles, it doesn't mean I want 10 on a 6-inch sub and Matt listened and only put a few. 

Overall, really really pleased with the staff at this location. They know what they're doing and it definitely shows. I'll go out of my way to go back to this subway in future. A much better experience than any other subway in Ajax/Pickering or Whitby. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Will NEVER step into this Subway!  Had to repeat my order five times and asked for mine and my sons sandwich toasted.  My sons sandwich was not toasted ad cold.  I went to counter and told them I had asked for a toasted sandwich.  They told me that they could not toast it more since they had alredy given it to me (that they could not take it back and put in the toaster) and if I wanted it more toasted, I would have to pay for another sandwich.  I told them I had just spent over $25 for my lunch and I wanted my sandwich the way I ordered it.  After more debate, the clerk said \"Whatever\" and remade the sandwich and acted like she (or he, couldn't tell) was doing me a favor.  Are You Kidding Me????  This is how they treat their customers????  Keep your effing sandwich......you have lost a customer and I will tell everyone I know to stay clear of this location, including Subway Corporation.      What a JOKE!!"}
{"text":"Subway is Subway.

My sandwich came out good, and the cashier (an older man) was SO friendly! Got a genuinely friendly vibe, not only the 'just doing my job' politeness you typically get from the younger people. 
Speed, parking, cleanliness were the usual."}
{"text":"I only go to this Subway because it's close to home. But every time I go in there the staff is very un personable and rude! Wish they would hire some new people"}
{"text":"Mrs. Patty and her staff are awesome! They remember orders and really are great people. Love catching up with them when I get in. Friendly, quick service. 
Bread and veggies always fresh! 
Love coming to this location. So does my wife and our daughter!"}
{"text":"I really like to eat subway it's so yummy, fresh, and healthy. So if you want to eat something that's fresh yummy and health go to subway. You can even get a good dink and dessert!"}
{"text":"Friendly people and a 24 hour location. It is Subways so in terms of quality control, it's pretty much the same. I come here if I am super lazy and need a quick bite. I never expect anything amazing. Just expect to wait a bit as there's usually only one person working but they're usually very kind."}
{"text":"Best managed Subway, anywhere. The staff are very friendly and very fast. Try a veggie patty sub with avocado next time you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I go to this one. Because it's literally down the street from my house ...the service is what I  more so talking about than the food I never have any complaints  with something being wrong with that but it the service it dry, dull and not consistent . They speak to you and that's the least they could do being that you gonna be on a small line that take too long to get down ...but they never have cookie ... no let me not say that the one time o came and ask for them he said they just wasn't making none the other times they said they didn't have any ... starting to feel like McDonald's  when you ask them for ice cream they say the machine broken ..."}
{"text":"I received a text from Subway today stating: \"Get a FREE 6 inch sub w/purchase of a 6 inch or footlong meal deal @ subway.\" I ordered two 6 inch Italian BMTs and showed her the text that I should receive a free 6 inch sub since I bought a 6 inch sub. However, she told me I had to buy the footlong meal deal. This is the second encounter I've had with the same gal. It's either she does not know how to read or she clearly is not servicing the customer from what the coupon states in the text. I did not say anything the first time it happen, but since it happened again, I need to address it as she could be doing this to everyone else."}
{"text":"Excellent Subway...all their staff since they opened are friendly and helpful.  They give generous toppings, without hesitation.  Located inside the Suncoast, next to their 24/7 cafe.  And since the cafe has altered its menu, I tend to venture over to the Subway."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor stay away from the Subway on the corner of Power and Baseline terrible terrible customer service spoke with the manager supposedly named Carlos no help.. had an incident the day before call back 
Ask talk to the manager.. but of course the manager wasn't there so I had to wait and call the following day which is today explain my situation he didn't seem to understand how I feel as far as my not understanding the pricing and why I got charged what I did so I asked to talk to his manager give me a number to a girl named Sarah of course he gave me the wrong number at first so he had time to communicate with Sarah before I called. Finally got to Sarah by this time she had already had a jaded opinion as to what I was going to ask no help ask for her boss she said she's as high as ago supposedly the area manager so there is no owner over her so I must be the only owner or general manager that owns the store so like I said do yourself a favor and stay away from this place customer service sucks"}
{"text":"Horrible service very disappoint at this place 2 woman gave me an attitude, very rude, poor service. Never come back there are many subways around the town to waist time here ."}
{"text":"BEWARE....DO NOT EAT HERE!!! RUDE OWNER!!!

There is a very rude man working at this location. Which come to find out he's also the owner. 

Today I received very poor service from him and will not be returning again. I understand that Subway is a chain and patrons just roll in but this business owner obviously doesn't care about his customers by the way I was treated. 

This loyal customer is taking her business else where and guess what there's another Subway location just down the street...2551 S Durango Dr."}
{"text":"I went to this location today and the man helping me with my sandwich and to check out was very unkind to us. We honestly said nothing wrong and he was so unprofessional and rude in how he spoke to us in line, like he didn't want us there and we were an inconvenience to him. 
Then we left our baskets on the table we ate at, i guess we didn't realize it... we threw away our trash and mess though. He seemed to get angry about that too and shouted at us as we left \"Thanks for leaving your baskets!\" I was shocked, as I have worked in food service for many years and I've never seen someone treat customers this way. I wish I got his name. Please teach the employees some good manners.... :("}
{"text":"Honestly you lost me from the door.. 
Your not even greeted with a hello..
\"What do you want \" is the very first thing you hear. 
Started to make my sub without gloves 
Turned around walked out. 
This place is disgusting 
Needs new staff,everyone Is straight miserable here 
Parking sucks too! Watch your car.."}
{"text":"I don't expect like 4 star service, but honestly felt like the staff was more invested in their personal conversation. In addition, the quality of the lettuce bin was concerning due to the brown pieces and they tend to be more scant on the toppings compared to other Subways."}
{"text":"My favorite subway. When I eat subway I prefer this location. The staff is friendly, welcoming &,fun.  Always have suggestions.  I'm always happy eating here & when I leave. A great location & people."}
{"text":"Small location with 3 tables inside. Couple small tables outside. Located next door to Starbucks. Location gets pretty busy between 12 and 1. They speak Spanish for all you Spanish speakers. Pretty fast and good service. Bathroom inside will be locked. Jus ask the clerk to open the door for you. Subway has sandwiches, chopped salads and flatizza. They also have chicken noodle and cheddar broccoli soup everyday.. And don't forget the cookies!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this subway. I  asked to use the restroom. I know it was for customers only but I figure before I asked for anything on the menu I wanted to see how I was treated. After watching how this employee handled the customer in front of me. He needed change for the bus and need to break a five. Employee quote well buy something and I will give you change so he buys a cookie even tho he did not want the cookie. The employee hands him his change the guy walks she replies you want your cookie he said no just needed the change she replies whatever. So I ask to use the restroom and she gives me the death stare told her I would only be a minute. She replies can't you go somewhere else I said no I really need to go. She gives me the stare again not saying anything. I told her if its that big of a deal I can go somewhere else. Her reply and I quote \"yea you should go do that. Horrible way to talk to people. I will no longer eat here again and I hope others will follow. To the Hispanic lady working at 10am on 8/26 good luck in life with that type of customer service if I could give no stars I would have taken that option"}
{"text":"Definitely convenient being right beside my house. Sandwiches have always been the way I want them. I've never had any issue with that. Sort of.

The store seems to be cleaned and nice ever time I'm in it.  Although my most recent visit the employees were cleaning the glass on the door where the bread is stored. He never really acknowledged me. I was the only one in the store. He kept cleaning. He eventually made it to me. Didn't really bother me other than him not washing his hands after using cleaner. He did put gloves on. 

For the most part he more acted like he was annoyed with me for interrupting his cleaning. It came to the part of me checking out and he just gave me my total. He never asked if I wanted chips, drink, cookies or anything. Oh well.

I'll be back being that it's subway and being that it's right beside my house."}
{"text":"If I ordered a breakfast BMT melt, which clearly states that it has egg, on the menu, do NOT roll your little bitch eyes at me, Charli, when I ask you to make me a new sandwich WITH THE FUCKING EGG YOU LEFT OFF!"}
{"text":"I ordered and paid for 3 subs on the internet today because I was in a hurry and did not want to wait.  When I arrived there were 4 people in line and only 1 person working. I saw the sign that said Express Pick Up so although I felt bad for going ahead of the other customers I went there and stood but was not acknowledged.  After about 5 minutes I asked the young man preparing the subs if my pickup order was ready and he replied he did not receive an order.  I had an email receipt that said the address was 35522 N. Scottsdale Road so I asked if this was it, but was told the address was on Cave Creek Road. I was not aware of another Subway near there but I went to my car and entered the address in to GPS and it brought me back to where I was. When I went back in there were still 3 customers in line and by the time I got served 45 minutes had passed from the time I first arrived at the store. When I asked the employee why he had not received my order, he stated that his boss gets them but does not let them know about it so it does no good to order online.  Also, when I got to the store the 2nd time I noticed that the street number on the store is 34522 not 35522.  What a way to run a business!!"}
{"text":"Very rude goofy looking white kid making our sandwiches. He practically tossed our sandwiches aside, never made eye contact, and acted like he wanted to be at a Goth concert. Not very high expectations coming from a snot nose kid, but \"come on\"! The owner should be ripped of their franchise."}
{"text":"I still very much enjoy the online ordering, and helpful and friendly staff here. I thought it was a one off/one employee thing, but the last time or two I picked up an online order the sandwich maker made sure to tell me one of my sandwiches was marked. (This one is not like the other type thing.) I (and my kids) very much appreciate this, and not always expected! Going to the extra step and I like it."}
{"text":"The BASICS. Always a good choice for a healthier choice. Subway is a basic sub shop but they do what they do well. The option to get as many or as few veggies as you like is a good thing. I had the flatbread veggie with all of the vegetables, peppers and Siracha. (It was Tuna Friday so I had em add 2 scoops!) Not for the timid with all of the peppers added. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"So I went in ordered my sandwich they took forever to make it and they didn't even ask if I wanted a second sandwich. They didn't have the bread I wanted.  Then I ordered a meatball for my wife and I'm watching them place the meatballs and I see in a 12\" they only put 4 meatballs. I see him trying to spread them out and I was like um that's not how many should be in there and he was like that's all that's left. They would need to prep more. So we was going to charge me a footlong with only 6\" worth of meatballs?!? They said it would take a while to prep the meatballs so I said I'll wait. Then they said they couldn't prep them cause it was too close to closing. Which was in 5 hrs....so I told them I would just take the 6\". They didn't even discount me or anything. Should have just walked out. Then when my wife ate the meatball sandwich she said it tasted weird and ended up having food poisoning during the night. Worst subway I've ever been to. Don't go to this place."}
{"text":"Fuck these guys.  If these guys were making cars, it would not drive.   Thank god they're only making sandwiches.  Even Arthur Dent knew how to make a sandwich.  These idiots consistently fuck up orders, sloppily lump toppings, mash up the bread and ignore topping requests.  They've been open for about a year, and I've seen the quality on a steady decline since day one.

I just removed a cup of jalapenos from my sandwich.  A CUP.  I'm sure that if you look in the bible, somewhere it says something about jalapenos being spaced a minimum of one inch apart in so that the sandwich consumer does not become overpowered by the force of the peppers.  After this cup was removed, there were still enough on the sub to be dangerous to my afternoon.  Contrast this to the fact that there were 3 (THREE) green olives placed onto my sub.   Sure buddy, we may have a language barrier.  But you clearly knew I meant olives, and you clearly should know that I wanted enough to be able to enjoy them.  

PROTIP:
Only the meat-man knows what you've ordered.  By the time you get to the cash here, you can tell the guy anything, and he'll ring it in."}
{"text":"So I've tried on multiple occasions to buy food from this location but they always say that their computers are down. My husband says the employees seem very \"chill\" like they visited the shop next door. Either way, this location needs some actual employees that want to do their job."}
{"text":"Stopped into this location, I frequent subways a lot but never this one. It was Saturday, and apparently I got the last of the daily special meat, which was chicken. The employee scooped the last of it, but I didn't feel it was a full serving. The next employee put on the veggies, had to ask him to even them out as they were all clustered. Finally, checkout..although she was friendly, she had to keep wiping her hands off as she was eating Doritos as she checked customers out. Just overall very improfessional and not your typical subway experience."}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review but here it is. I came in today about noon and the first this I see are two employees arguing about one of them needing a break. One of them asked what I want then tells the other employee to make it for me. They continue to argue in front of the already cringing customers. I say, \"Hey guys all I want is a sandwich,\" then the one employee who is making my sandwich chucks a KNIFE in the direction of the other employee. WTF?! At that moment the customers were in shock and the employees acted like it was business as usual. What an embarrassment for then management and owners. I hope they correct this situation before something like this happens again. Oh, the sub was made great by the way."}
{"text":"I went to this Subway today excited that it was a drive thru. That part as great...easy ect. But good lord...the bread at this place is terrible. It's pretty much most Subway's I have been to as well. I keep thinking it will get better and keep trying it over and over, but wow. The bread is stale EVERY time. I guess I don't understand how they can serve this?"}
{"text":"Came in Friday March 9 at 1230pm there were 7 people ahead of me, 1 person on behind counter making sandwiches. She was just finishing with 2 customers paying cash. The next person in line commented to the employee that she had been waiting 15 minutes - no response. My wife told me if she doesn't change her gloves after making the previous customers sandwiches after dealing with the cash register and handling cash that we were going to leave. As she started to make the next customers sandwiches without changing her gloves (gross) and not wanting to waste our lunch time waiting in line it was a no brainer to leave."}
{"text":"This place is a godsend for guests at nearby hotels who would otherwise go hungry or live on room-temperature snacks for the duration of their stay. I was just involved in a conference at which many of the attendees might have perished in the Canada wind if it weren't for Subway. I had a veggie sandwich, which was delicious and life-affirming, considering the circumstances. 

Thanks, Subway!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Employees don't care to greet customers as they walk in. My husband ordered us a footlong turkey sandwich. The male that made the sandwich was very rude and short. Didn't bother asking if he wanted his sandwich toasted and failed to say anything after the transaction. Even though this location is convenient, it's best to go to Harris Teeter for handmade subs and much better customer service. I gave them two stars instead of one, only because the sandwich was quite tasty. The ingredients were of good quality but quality food doesn't make up for poor customer service. The customer should never feel as though they are inconveniencing an employee by asking them to simply do their job."}
{"text":"Didn't think I would be rating a Subway, however I felt I should give a shout out to the staff. They were very friendly, courteous and fast. Great job! The sandwich was good as well."}
{"text":"This was thee best experience I've ever had at subway! The two young ladies working there, mother and daughter, were amazing, I just don't think people appreciate how hard it is to make a 2 minute sandwich to the customers preferences while making another customers 2 minute sandwich. Truly great and I will definitely be back to this subway before going to any other."}
{"text":"I no longer frequent this Subway location which is a shame because it's very near my work. This is the only location that refuses to serve egg after breakfast. All the other locations serve egg all day long. Not this one. No egg after 11. That's ridiculous. It's refrigerated. It's not like they have to make the eggs to order."}
{"text":"The cleanest subway I've been to. Nice customer service and well made sandwiches. And Todd told them about how they owed him a sandwich from a long time ago and they gave it to him, no questions asked."}
{"text":"Typical subway, but open 24 hours which is great. 
Seems clean and the staff have been good."}
{"text":"Larger than most subways, this place gets packed around lunch time. They are open on most holidays, like today, Easter. Bathrooms are usually kept clean and the food is exactly what you see. The service is some times slow and the people are like zombies when it comes to, \"what do you want?\" Otherwise, no real complaints."}
{"text":"Please get your employees to honor the opening hours. If yall open at 9 am in your dining room then the doors should be open by 9 am. I love your service when  we get to come but your hours are so strange!!!"}
{"text":"We went there for their grand opening. Of course, it was a bit crowded and they had run out of some food. Their manager made up for the disappointment with great customer service. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good people in this subway!! Only problem bout eating at subway is how nasty your clothes smell after, wonder why? Need I saw more bout subway food though ?"}
{"text":"This review isn't for Subway in general but this location specifically. I have closer Subways to me but this location surpasses them on service. They know me by name now, remember what sandwich I like, and that I am a student at UNLV. All meaningless things, sure, but the fact they took time to remember deserves my business. The employees are always in a good mood and the owner and her family, mainly her daughter, are so friendly. They truly make you feel like part of their extended family. 

As for the food, its made neatly yet it tastes the same as the others. The presentation is definitely better and the restaurant is clean and organized."}
{"text":"First Jared gets busted for Child Porn, then the subway at 11 W Jefferson closes and forces me to this Subway.  Then this Subway gets a new Manager who says my substitution of pepperoni for the salami in my Spicey  Italian  (Which I have ordered close to 50 times this year) isn't allowed and I will be charged for double meat because of food cost.  Didn't know that pepperoni cost more than salami.  So so long subway and hello some other Sandwich place.  And to the Hiring Manager of the self proclaimed new Manager.  Good Hire."}
{"text":"After the gym today, I came to Subway to get a cheap meal that was healthy enough for me to continue losing weight.  Hey, if Jared can do it, so can I! LOL.

The place is super small.  Probably 6-7 tables max.  This place is just like any other Subway.  One thing I dislike is the way I smell after visiting this place.  At first, I thought it was onions, but now I think it's the actual bread that makes you smell.  Maybe I'm wrong.  The staff is very young here, but super friendly.  

I got the turkey breast footlong sub for $6.25.  My bread of choice was and always is, the Italian Herbs and Cheese.  I got the turkey breast and provolone cheese, all toasted.  Toppings were lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, red onions and a little mayo.  Not my complete choice if I had one, but I really don't want to back track on my weight loss.  I usually get the hot pastrami footlong for $8.25.  Now that's a sandwich!  Pastrami, provolone, lettuce, cucumbers, peppers and mayo.  I think of all sandwich joints I've tried, Subway and Port of Subs has to be one of the best pastrami joints for me.  

Remember folks, this place is a fast food sub sandwich joint.  Not a lot more to say about it.  When I'm hungry for a fast meal, I appreciate the efficiency at this place.  If you're looking to grab a fast sub, don't ever leave this place out!"}
{"text":"Ran here to get a sub sandwich.  I got the turkey sub with provolone cheese and piled on the veggies.  The girl helping was nice, however very sloppy.  She didn't evenly distribute my veggies, so every bite wasn't the same.  She packed on the mayo so I felt as if I was drinking my sandwich and it wasn't rolled up nicely so my sub almost fell out of the packaging.  I'm not really feeling like there's anything else to say about it.  It's a Subway.  They all smell the same, look the same and feel the same.  The food is good.  The overall experience is just alright."}
{"text":"Deciding what to eat today, we came across the street from work and decided on Subway.  It's always a great choice for a healthier lunch.  No surprise to anyone, when you walk into a Subway, your nose is overwhelmed with the smell of baked breads.  It's too much sometimes.  Your clothes smells and lingers throughout the day with that bread smell!  Not a big deal but I would prefer it not smell that bad.

Every time I go there, I always get the same thing:  Turkey foot long sandwich on 9-Grain Oat wheat bread.  I add American cheese and toast the sandwich.  For toppings, I got the mayo, spinach, lettuce, onions, olives, bell peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes.  Such a great sandwich with not a lot of calories.  My food came to about $7.  

No really problems with this place.  The location is clean, lots of seating.  Long lines told me it was popular.  I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"This Subway is located right next to the 24 Hour Fitness I go to every Mondays.  I ended a 2 hour session and was really hungry.  Then I remember that for the month of February, they were promoting a $5 foot long sub sandwich.  I got the Turkey foot long sub for $5.41 including tax.  I started off with getting the 9-grain honey oat bread, turkey breast with white American cheese and all toasted.  My  toppings were lettuce, spinach, red onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, green peppers, and light mayonnaise.  This sandwich is usually my favorite.  It's full of flavor and really fills me up!

Now if you've ever been in a Subway, you've been to them all.  This franchise is usually small and really focuses on showcasing the food ingredients.  It's an assembly line type restaurant.  Order your meat, move down.  Order your toppings, moved down.  I like the efficiency.  The employees were not as cool.  I wish he had more personality and engaged in his customers.  In the beginning, I tried clarifying the $5 foot long sale and he said, \"it's only for this month.\" Hmmm, OK well it's the middle of the month and I'm only worried about today, so a simple \"yes\" would have suffice.  Plus, it just seemed like I was inconveniencing him.  Such a turn off.  

I'm always going to frequent a Subway.  It's a place where the food doesn't make me feel like I'm taking steps back on my healthy kick.  It's probably because of the fast food type situation.  No matter the service, you can always count of getting in and getting out."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town, and my daughter wanted subway. We went in to get her a kids' meal. She will only eat pepperoni subs and the lady at the counter rudely refused to make her one with a kids' meal. I wouldn't have minded being up-charged either but she firmly refused, like she was a robot and could only make the selected items from the limited menu.  I asked to speak to the manager and she said they wouldn't be in today. I have been to plenty of subways who will make my daughter a sub the way she likes it and just charge extra but this lady just repeatedly refused. So we left without getting anything. As we were leaving my daughter was in tears because the lady was so rude. I went to the subway on West Trade and they happily made her sub with a kids meal. If you have the ingredients you should be able to make it for your customer for an extra fee. Management shouldn't hire robots to work behind the counter. I will never visit this subway again!"}
{"text":"This is your average subway. You come in and order a sandwich and for the next three to five hours you smell like subway. Subway does have a few sandwiches I enjoy eating and more specifically the chicken sandwich that actually looks like chunks of chicken and not slices of colored paper. This place is ok, but if your hungry and in a time crunch, why not?"}
{"text":"I have given this subway SOOO many chances, but they can not seem to get their bread right. Subway prides itself on quality of its bread and ingredients, but this location is failing.  I will not be going back.  I am sick of giving them chances and being stuck with over proofed bread.  The color, consistency, shape, and thickness are all off.  I even questioned the worker about the strange shape of the bread and she just said that the person who was working last night, but it in backwards????  If the bread is not good, do not serve it.  I would not recommend this location and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Oh my god this friggin guy making my sandwiches kept sucking his boogers back, you know like when you have allergies or you're sick. I thought I was going to be sick myself. I might be wrong about this but if you are sick you probably shouldn't be anywhere close to food, specifically MY FOOD! Otherwise no different than any other subway, relatively clean and efficient service. Gross!"}
{"text":"Subway food is always amazing. I love the food so much but this 1 star isn't about the food. It's about the customer service. So a couple of us were pretty hungry and we were just a bit indecisive on what kind of meat we wanted, we were extremely nice to the guy who was working, Eric but his name tag said something else? So not sure what his name was but Eric was on the receipt. Like I was saying, being indecisive on what kind of meat we wanted, we apologized. But as rude as he was, he was getting impatient and constantly kept asking us \"what kind of meat do you want\" which was irking us & pressuring us a lot. We weren't entirely done with our orders and I needed to order about 2 more sandwiches and I apologized again asking for 2 more sandwiches and he looked at me and rolled his eyes. I get it, you're tired & you're working a late shift but I was being extremely nice to you. And when he was ringing my orders up, I wanted one last drink to wrap up this whole order & he dead stares at me & gives me attitude saying \"HOW MANY?\" And rolls his eyes again. Which was so extra of him to be rude about. Why work there if you hate it so much to a point where you have to take it out on the customers? Like come on. Eric or whatever, has to work on his customer skills."}
{"text":"Worst employees ever! Worst Subway ever! Thank you for reminding me why I stopped going to Subway 5 years ago! I'm disgusted ugh!....Subway ran a promo a few days ago...I decided to give it another try....worst mistake ever....buy a sandwich deal and get another one free! Lie! Lie ! Lie! I asked the idiot girl working there, tell me if you still have the deal for the sandwich and for what size! She said any size and we will match the free one for the same size! When I got to the register the rude man told me my bill was almost $16 bucks! Are u kidding me for one sandwich ? SUBWAY Rips people off by scamming them now ?? ....I was told that the measurements are calculated into the footlong by 4 x sandwiches! What bs is that! I Told the guy that all the other subways are offering footlong deals and footlong free sandwich...he said this subway doesn't ! Really, did he just make a decision for the whole corporation last minute? Three incompetent employees who couldn't handle 10 clients, lied and ran out of bread or just made footlong bread and said they didn't have 6' so they could rip people off ! I'm sure I was not the only disgusted client not only with your nasty tasting sandwich but with the whole subway ! Can't wait to see your doors shut!! Thanks for the promo to remind us never to give you our money, your business is a scam ! Will spread the words to my clients as well..."}
{"text":"WHERE THE HECK IS 0 STAR BUTTON?
Let me explain my story here. I was there with my roommates at 3AM, last Saturday; or Sunday. Door was locked, which was understandable, dangerous at 3AM. Staff opened the door for us, we went in. Staff asked us what we would like to have instead of greeting us first, which actually was fine with me since all I wanted was a sub, not a 5 star hotel service. I ordered spicy Italian, and asked her to put sauce first before I toast it. She never answered and tried to put it in the oven, so I let her know one more time, then she put sauce that I have requested before toasting it. I guess mine went smooth after that point. 


What pissed me off was when my roommate was trying to order his. He was trying to order teriyaki and asked lady whether or not he can get that as a Panini. She ignored first time. And started to make sub. She asked us whether or not he wanted that toasted. He said no. but he still wanted that as a Panini. Lady ignored again, and tried to go on a vegetable side. Right before she put vegetables, my friend asked one more time whether or not he can get that as a Panini, and lady acted like she was annoyed, and did not want to assist us. So I stood up and told that lady, \"If you have once responded his request, yes or no, we won't be keep asking you the same questions!\".  AND SHE TOLD ME TO SHUT UP. LITERALLY SHUT UP. I thought I misheard, so I asked my friend, what she said. And my friend knew that I would be pissed off and start cursing, so instead letting me know what she said, my roommate told her \"You should not say that to customers\" VERY NICELY. And she told us to leave.  We were like.. WTF...?  Trust me. We were nice, we did not curse or anything, and I even used ma'am while I was making my sub. But we were still evicted because we were arguing over what we have requested. I do understand that restaurant deserves the right to refuse customer, but to be honest, was it a legitimate reason for her to evict us? I do not believe so.

We left, and next day, I called subway to talk to manager to share this feedback before I make a bad review everywhere. Manager was not there, so I asked staff to write down my number and my name so that manager can give me a call back to share this feedback. The manager has not called me since last Saturday, and I come, my first 1Star review (Wished it was 0 Star). 

I am mad at the staff that time, but I am more upset that manager did not call me back. Is it because they are a franchise and they don't give a F about  service? Welp. For sure, even though I live really close by this place, I don't think I will be coming to this location, maybe nor the subway. Trust me, McDonald staff won't say SHUT UP to their customers."}
{"text":"Hello friends,

I guess my review I wrote while still inside wss so great, that I have to write....\"Another one\" (DJ Khalid voice) 

I had the pleasure of coming here for \"breakfast\" for my wife. After standing there watching the lady prepare the daily bread trays not even looking up to acknowledge my existence; I touched the counter to make sure I hadn't passed over to the after life and somehow died and wanted Subway.  Much to my happiness, I was still alive and well. Well as in I know darn well she sees me standing here. 

  After a while she \"noticed me\" and asked,  \"Are you ready\"? Which I answered, \"Why yes,  yes I'm... finally ready\". I ordered a flatbread something or other.  She asked if I wanted it toasted.  I replied, No. She said it's supposed to be toasted or it will break apart and not be good.  Well why is Not being toasted even an option?

  Short story long,  she had a poopy attitude,  the food was Subwayish and nothing to write home about. 

  I gave 2 stars for the Raspberry White Chocolate cookies!!

{"text":"This is a good Subway. Always fast, friendly and they are not stingy with the toppings. It gets crowded at lunch time so go early."}
{"text":"ONE STAR SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO LESSER OPTION.
The blonde woman working the counter, unsure if she is the manager or just an associate, is the reason this store/location lost 2 more of it's customers today.
Management should seriously evaluate their employees. 
I work customer service and am more than forgiving if someone is busy or unavailable but this place is a ghost town in there. The younger guy that ended up helping us was friendly enough, but first impressions were set when we walked in and got the greeting, or lack thereof.
Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your time or money here. 
As far as upper management goes, do something about this immediately before this woman takes your store down.
Terrible service! We won't be back."}
{"text":"There's not many 24 hour Subway places so I thought I should put up that this is the newest location to do so. They just put their sign up :-) 

Yeah, it's still fast food, but it's not bad tasting and not the worse thing I can be eating at 3am. 

Sometimes a late night tuna sandwich or some cold cuts and veggies just sounds nice."}
{"text":"PROS: On the dark side of campus. one of the more healthier options. 

They have friendly staff and A clean atmosphere on the inside. 

there are also 2 places to order.

CONS: even with all this, they are still really inefficient. The line can get way too long to wait in. 

there many times that they are under stocked with food items. And some of the items don't taste as fresh as others!

sometimes customer service can get awkward lol, it's not very good.

OVERALL: I always come here because it's closest to my classes, but they could use major improvements!"}
{"text":"A subway worthy of a yelp review!  I walked in at lunch time.  The gentlemen behind the counter, Chris was very friendly and  acknowledged the customers in line already as well as myself that he'd be right with us.   The prep of my sandwich was quick!  He loaded up my roasted chicken sandwich with lots of veggies.  The service was friendly and good!  He offered a cute basket for eating in.  They was good music playing through out the restaurant.   Best Subway experience I have had ... this coming from a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Food was good as it usually is at subway but I ordered pick up online through grub hub and got there a little after the expected time it was to be ready well when I got there the place was slammed and only one person working my order haven't even been started so I told her okay she said she would make it right now so she did the other people were mad and she had to make more grub hub orders in between their food and that made everyone mad moral of the story have more help at lunch time that was crazy"}
{"text":"We wanted to get a quick bite as we didn't have much time to go to a restaurant before going to the airport so came to the food court in Bally's.  The food court has been renovated since I last came and the seating area is nicer.  The Subway wasn't busy and it's Subway, so I know what I would be getting.  The prices are higher than I have seen but cheaper than a restaurant.  I ordered the foot long sweet onion chicken teriyaki for $9.75.  Service was quick, and they gave me ample vegetables and sauce on my sub.  Quick service and Subway quality.  Come if you want a quick and fast meal."}
{"text":"So I want to start by saying that a few months ago I had completely given up on this Subway location. I would come in once or twice a week around the same time, as I work just right down the street, and whenever I would come in the same to girls would be working. And every time I came in it was the same thing, they were talking in the back very loudly but no one was watching the counter. I was okay with it at first but it began to irritate be, and than one day while my sandwich was being toasted, the girl walked in the back to talk to the other girl and stood back there for at least 5 minutes to discuss how one of their friends became a stripper. So I left. 

About two weeks ago I came back in for the first time as a last resort from being short on time, and there were new employee's working and I was delighted with how I was treated. So I gave it another shot last week and again, very helpful staff who didn't leave my food unattended to go have a conversation. I will again be frequenting this location. The food is always consistent and now the staff is up to par."}
{"text":"Another \"restaurant\" and I use that term loosely that doesn't have white bread at 6:15 pm on a Thursday night. 

Sorry but won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"After walking out of the 51st & Olive location because they didn't have white bread, I came here. 

Kamara made an amazing sandwich!  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"So apparently they can't handle things when they're busy. As my husband placed the order he was rushed up to the register to hurry up and pay. Well since he was at the register he was unable to watch them make the sandwiches. Needless to say by the time we got the sandwiches home they were all wrong. Instead of a BMT sub, we got roast beef and apparently when you ask for olives they give you onions instead! Not happy about that at all. And when I called back the restaurant to tell them of their mistake I spoke to the manager. She asked me if I was sure I had the right store, when I confirmed that I did, She hung up on me! In general I really like subway but I won't be going back to that one"}
{"text":"Ok so yes, it's a Subway. You have seen one, you have seen them all. But the guy who owns this one not only hates being a \"sandwich artist\" he hates his life and seems like his customers as well. 
The first time I went in, I ordered avocado and when I bit into my sammy, I realized there was ice chips in the avocado. Talk about a footlong buzz kill. I went up to tell him that he might want to make sure that it is thawed out before he gives it to another customer and he muttered out some sentence fragment that I think was that it came from the freezer. Thanks, captain obvious. 
I decided maybe he was having a bad day so I tried it again. Now I don't need someone belting out show tunes or anything, but this guy acts like he is making a meal for someone who shot his best dog. After he unwillingly made my lunch and tossed it in my general direction, he then proceeded to leave the premises leaving me and my two kids by ourselves. Being the only ones in the entire place promtped my 5 year old to say \"does that mean this is our subway now??\" 
Anyways, I will now drive 2 miles out of my way to avoid spending my buy one get one 6 inch free. He might not feel a big rathe, but I hope he eventually realizes that things could be a lot worse and that he might want to force out a smile or even a \"thanks for coming to subway\" every now and again if he would like to keep his business."}
{"text":"The tally was $13.35 before my son said he would like to add a soda, now the total would be $15.14 said Perla, the sandwich maker/cashier, presumably she was reading off the register as she said that.  As I was paying, I asked her if the receipt was in the bag, she said yes.  Seeing I was ACTUALLY looking for the receipt, she said: \"Oh, it's here\". The receipt was on the register all along and it seems like she didn't want to give it to me at first, but she grabbed the receipt from the register finally.  As she was handing that receipt to me, she asked how old my son is, (she wasn't friendly at all prior to that moment), so I answered her question meanwhile forgetting to look at the receipt.  Back to the hotel, I happened to see the receipt, it was ACTUALLY $12.65 as shown on the pic.  I also realized she didn't give me a receipt for the sandwiches I bought the night before and she overcharged me more than $2 as well.  I know it's only a few dollars, most ppl don't even bother checking or asking for a receipt.  I see a lot of taxi/limo drivers here, and I wonder how many ppl have left without a receipt.  Speaking of receipt,  Subway has a slogan, \"If we don't give you a receipt, you get your sandwich free\".  The register automatically printed their current sale code which I wasn't aware of, each Subway has it's own price and various codes from time to time.  Either way, discount or no discount, we pay the receipt amount, plus whatever the tip amount, isn't that the whole point of receipt?  We had been here before, the service was good generally.  Hopefully this is NOT their common practice.  Two stars for them opening 24 hrs."}
{"text":"Girl was nice, however, the worst sandwich in the world. For $8.75 the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich had  so little meat on it, I had to check to see if there was any!! It in no way looked like the picture they advertize with!!! Not heated all the way.  I will never eat at Subway again!"}
{"text":"This subway sucks!  They never participate with most specials that are advertised on TV.  They didn't even want to  honor my coupon!  They made my sandwich, and then  I gave him the coupon, he goes, ohhhhh I already rang it up! ok!  I want to use my coupon.  He said I can't REALLY.... Then some other dude comes over, and said ohhhh , this is for another location! I've been here 3 times already and used these coupons!  Ok, I'm not paying regular price, give me a refund, and keep your sandwich!   Don't they know there's a subway on every corner!  And subways, that will accept my coupon!  YA'LL SUCK!  And it all worked out, because, I didn't like the way she was making my sandwich anyway.  She acted like she was rationing out the ingredients.  I had to keep asking her, can you put more olives, can you put more onions, can you put more jalapenos!  DAYM!"}
{"text":"Horrible. One of the worse subways I have been too. They were rude and arrogant. My sandwich tasted like the meat was old. Lettuce was almost brown and just very hateful staff."}
{"text":"We ordered already and when we got to the counter they told us they dont accept cards cause their machine broke down. They dint even tell us beforehand! What a hassle."}
{"text":"I eat at Subway at *least* once a week. This location is by FAR my favorite in the GTA. 
It is family owned/operated and they are all such good people. They even remember my order when I go in, which gets serious bonus points from me. They also make your sub with care. That might sound silly, but when I get a sub made and the \"sandwich artist\" is throwing the cheese on haphazardly and making a general mess of the thing I get offended. They also aren't stingy--if there's another thing I hate it's having to say \"can I get a little more xxxx\" after every topping I request.
I should think twice about writing reviews around lunch time though...now I am STARVING!"}
{"text":"I came to this Subway at 9:30 p.m. (9:28) on April 23 and the girl said \"I'm sorry, we are closed\". No you are not closed. It says on the Yelp app that it closes at 10, the door was open with an open sign on, they didn't put up their containers yet, and I used to work at Subway so I know their working hours. I'm sure they were eager to go home but they are not closed yet! Their lies in my face pissed me off."}
{"text":"This is one of the busiest subways I've seen, but for some reason they are also the slowest. Just like any other made to order, cafeteria style restaurant, speed is a big deal and they just can't figure that part out. I would come more often for a quick bite when I'm in the area but \"quick\" bite and this subway don't go hand and hand lol

The food is as expected. Fresh baked bread, thinly sliced meats and cheeses with a decent assortment of vegetables and sauces available. 

Pricing is comparable to other sub businesses and the location is great.  I'll be back when I'm in the mood for a simple meal with time to kill."}
{"text":"Gyeeeeeah Im a fan....

This place is better than eating fast foods.. I normally order their Broccoli cheddar soup for my mom. It's quick and easy in and out of cheap sandwiches and cheap eats..If i had to order something here I would normally order the cold cut combo on wheat bread toasted with cheese.. All I have to say is it get' the stomach full.. Nothing too fancy like firehouse subs but get's the job done to satisfy your hunger and it's somewhat healthy. Like I said its better than eating Mc Donald's or any other fast food places.. and their lettuce and veggies and meats are pretty fresh as well can't really complain.."}
{"text":"Was last here on Sat/14 Sep and Sun/15 Sep to pick-up $5 footlongs (meatball marinara) for dinner.
- I've always been satisfied with the service and the food here.
- Shop is always clean.
- Even during the occasional lunches I go there, if there is a line it moves at a brisk pace since the employees are fast.
- Since it's next door to Smith's Supermarket I can do my grocery shopping (but then I'm too lazy to cook) and then walk over to Subway to get a sub."}
{"text":"Waiting on news from a friend about possible allergies, I decided not to get a dozen cookies from a Subway I was at earlier for $5 TI. I assumed as I have been to several other Subway's that have that same deal no matter what time of day and already in a container. Sounded like a fun thing to bring to a BBQ dinner with adults and kids.

As we were short of time and headed closer to my friends place and much to my chagrin I discovered that this particular Subway's charges over double for the same 12 cookies. 

Now I've only been going to chain restaurants for as long as I can remember, and most of the time they have the same promotions at all the restaurants in the same city or even Province etc. (I know about fine print, but more than double at the chain with the most locations). 

The guy at the counter was quite nice about it, but boy did I feel jipped. I did not want to disappoint the kids, or the adults that act like kids, so I bought them begrudgingly. 

Not so cool, regardless when the owner must know that many other Subway's in the same city charge less than half for cookies. I'd be glad to hear the reason for this, and possibly give the location another go.

Unfortunately, this will lower their average and makes for my first one star review. 

Note: I am not speaking about the food or their location in general, only the fact that double the price in not fun, perhaps a baker's dozen would be a token of fairness at least."}
{"text":"The bread here is crummy, half baked and stale even when \"fresh.\" I won't be back."}
{"text":"It took 13 minutes to make my two sandwiches. 

Yes. I times. After I saw the speed that the bread was taken out I knew there was a record in the making. 

The gentleman that helped me also seemed incredibly out of it. He mumbled and if I hadn't been to subways before I wouldn't have ever known what he was saying. 

Incredibly slow, and rather... uncaring, dare I say. But I'll be damned if this isn't the most meticulously crafted sandwich I've ever had."}
{"text":"I have a strange, new found love for Subway. 
I have boycotted it for years because of the bread smell that clings to you well after setting foot in its doors. 
But I'm back, and that veggie sandwich is better than ever. 
The best part of all is how cheap Subway is. You can go have a fattier and more expensive lunch at say, Manuels and spend $10 easy or get a veggie sub at Subway and spend $4. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm no Jared, but you can definitely find me in Subway at least a few times a week now. 
My roommate and I are really jazzed about their after 4pm special too, 2 subs of your choice, 2 drinks, 2 bags of chips and 2 cookies for $9.99. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"4 stars for great service.  I had the chopped salad and the server was great in explaining the options to me.   For a theatre location, it's the same type of layout and food options so that was good.  

Would go again."}
{"text":"Understaffed and when we went it was \"cash only\".  Really?

They don't have the egg salad sub and not sure why they don't carry it? It seems to be a smaller location so maybe they don't have the full square footage to carry the full selection?

Otherwise it's standard subway fare and tastes fresh!"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 52/100***

I have been coming to this Subway on and off for over 2 years now. No complaints on the quality and service. As a matter of fact, I have always enjoyed coming here due to the diligence of their staff especially Thelma. She's very pleasant to deal with and always gets me in and out in a matter of minutes. The quality is fresh and I have never had a bad sandwich or experience here.

My gripe is due to my visit today and finding something unforgiving about this place. After I ordered my sandwich and a quick chit chat with Thelma I was on my merry way. When I got back in the car, hubby informed me that the little one needed to use the restroom. We went back inside and asked for the key to the bathroom. Imagine my surprise while inside to find out they didn't have any toilet seat covers. I would understand if the reason was they ran out, BUT I didn't see any dispenser whatsoever. I couldn't believe it so I checked all four corners lol just to make sure I wasn't imagining the lack of dispenser but alas, NADA. Of course I had to improvise and used toilet paper to line it with instead. Isn't that considered a health violation? In all the time I visited this particular Subway this was the very first time I've had to use their restroom and most definitely the last time. WTH! I wanted to ask Thelma what the deal was but she was busy helping others, will definitely have to take it up with management next time I visit."}
{"text":"They raised their prices again bah hah.  And when they send coupons out now they are only for 6\" inch sandwich and still give less meat then port of subs."}
{"text":"Raised prices and coupons don,t include any 12 inch sandwich specials. Used to buy here weekly but no longer can afford it especially with the fact that they give less meat and cheese then Port of Subs."}
{"text":"Jared:  \"Welcome to Subway!  Have you seen my commercial with Michael Strahan?\"

Me: \"Uh...yes?\"

Jared:  \"Can I interest you in a sub made with our new rosemary sea salt bread?\"

Jared: \"Oh, he's cool.  We're making Subway commercials, you know?  It's not like we were hanging out or anything.\"

Me:  \"Right.  I'll have the meatball marinara with provolone.\"

\"Might I recommend the pepper jack as an alternative?\"

\"No, I'll stick with the provolone for the meatball sub.  Pepper jack works with the tuna.  They should ease up on the mayo in the tuna, though.\"

\"I'll let them know.  Would you like it toasted?\"

\"Yes.  So you'll let them know?  Them?  The...Subway people?\"

\"Yeah.  We've been through some tough times together.  They'll take it to heart coming from me.\"

\"So you're saying they won't take it to heart coming from me?  And what tough times are you talking about?\"

\"Well you're a customer.  I'm a lifer.\"

\"A lifer?  Was this Subway gig a sentence then?\"

\"No, I mean a long term commitment sort of lifer.\"

\"So you're like...married to, uh, the Subway people?  What do you call them in private?  Do you make sexual jokes about subs?  Do you?  Cause' that would be wrong.\"

\"No, it's not like that at all.  What toppings would you like?\"

\"Black olive, tomato, onion and spinach.  Are you ashamed of this relationship?  Is that what it is, cause' it's kind of out there now.  I mean the commercials and everything.  But let's get back to the tough times.  What were those exactly?\"

\"No, I'm not ashamed.  Look, I lost weight, I did a commercial, then another...you know how these things go.\"

\"Yeah...no I don't know how these things go.  I'm still, uh, waiting for my first spokesperson opportunity...I guess.  How do they go?  Is it like an addiction?  Did you get dumped and hit the subs hard?  Was Subway second best for you?  Have you ever heard the saying \"You can get what's second best but it's hard to get enough\", is that how this whole thing went down?\"

\"No!  Whatever man, do you want any mayo or dressings on your freakin' sub?\"

\"My freakin' sub?\"

\"Sorry.  I'm really sorry about that.  Do you?\"

\"No.  And the hard times?  Hmm?\"

\"Do you want to combo that?\"

\"No.  Wait, does the combo include a little story about Jared and Subway's troubles?\"

\"No.  Look, we used to only give like one strand.  Of onion.  Or pepper.  And like one little slice of tomato.  We were really kind of stingy with toppings I guess you could say.  It's not a time we reflect on proudly.\"

\"Yeah, I remember those times.  I would order a veggie sub and sandwich dude would gently lay one strand of green pepper and one thin strand of onion along my sub.  I would be like \"more\" and he would bust out...another strand.  And I would be like \"MORE.\"  And he would look at me with a strained expression and then he would bust out like two or three strands.  Yeah, those were messed up times.\"

\"Right.  Thanks for coming to Subway!\"

\"Sure.  Let the, um, Subway people know that things have improved, ok?  I mean the bread is better, there are more and better toppings and you're working on that stingy thing still right?\"

\"Yeah, I'll pass it along.\"

\"You do that.  And can I get two napkins with this sandwich please?  Thanks.\""}

So I stare back, and say \"extra please\", and then they give me one more, and so on.

This location is a little further from my house from the one on Gibson, yet I have learned that it's worth the drive.  The place is clean and the workers are exceptionally accommodating and friendly.  They don't emanate that \"I freaking hate my crappy job\" vibe that you see at most Subway restaurants."}
{"text":"I always end up eating at this Subway.  I really like my chicken teriyaki salads.  However, some of the workers are really... interesting people.

Then there's another young guy who doesn't listen and puts the wrong things on the sandwich (even if you repeat the same word over and over... if I say \"pickles... pickles... PICKLES!\", I probably want pickles).

Still, this is down the street from my apartment.  It's clean enough.  The service is lacking, but not enough for me to avoid the place.  Whatever.  It's Subway.  If I want a gourmet meal, I'll go elsewhere."}

{"text":"I did follow up with corporate who then had the franchise owner contact me.  She was extremely nice and listened to my story.  She does genuinely care about her stores providing good customer service and I could hear her disappointment that I was let down.

She explained that if a customer does come back to the store and is unhappy with their order, it is supposed to be re-made - no questions asked.  This definitely did not happen on Sunday night when I made the order and I was given a hard time, along with my husband who tried to have my order corrected for me when I gave up.

We did talk about more personal stuff that I will not share here in order to protect the privacy of the employees but I felt the resolution was fair.  Near the end of the call, she asked me about the compensation I was looking for and I told her that I just wanted to be heard and acknowledged.  I think she was surprised by this but was happy that this was brought to her attention so she can follow up with the staff.  She apologized for the experience and invited me to come back to this store to give it another chance.  I probably will in due time."}
{"text":"The students here are filled to the brim with boredom. I wanted to get myself some sweet tea but they had none. When I brought this up to them, they just didn't care and didn't feel like refilling it."}

{"text":"This Subway is located in a food court near the Imperial Palace Hotel. Once in a while in Vegas, you are just craving something \"healthy.\" Luckily, you can grab a healthy-ish sandwich at Subway and eat it by the pool at the Imperial Palace that you would not dare to enter because of the layer of grease along the top... your sando and diet coke can provide good refreshment though!"}
{"text":"One of the worst subways I have ever eaten at, today I go in and the employee named Giti when she makes my sub she crushes it every time with out fail. Today I asked her why she does that and she muttered something unintelligible, then I go to the drink fountain and get a cherry coke which is straight cherry syrup when I question this they say it's cherry coke, I try some and it's definitely not cherry coke but just straight cherry syrup. They don't have their stuff together even if they are nice. Service is service but when you can't make a sandwich or have ROTTEN onions (something else I saw today) in the third pan you're doing something wrong. Get all your stuff together and put it in a box so you keep it together. The only reason I keep going back is it's one of the only restaurants near my house, honestly management is the problem because the employees do whatever without consequences. I give this place four thumbs down, the milks got me bad. Thanks for horrible food"}
{"text":"The first time we experience Subway breakfast and it was goood."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a large drink since my pups were not finished being groomed. The store is very well maintained and the workers are very friendly. 

The drink station is kept clean and does not have any drink splatter marks or drops. The workers come out every 10minutes or so to ensure all the chairs and tables are clean. Best subway location I have been to. 

Love the tea station!"}

{"text":"Ate lunch here today and the only reason I'm leaving a review is of the person I saw there.

I had the meatball marinara on wheat. Gotta say that there really isn't a difference between this meatball sub and the ones from Firehouse Subs. They taste the same and Firehouse charges alot more for theirs. Anyways, it's a pretty decent sub with some good flavor. 

Service was good, as they quickly greeted me as I entered the restaurant. 

I don't get star struck nor give a rats butt over celebrities. But, I saw Mike Watkiss from channel 3 or 6 (could care less which one). That guy is short as hell (looked like he's about 5'3\") and wears makeup during the day (not just for TV, I guess). He maybe in his 50's but looks like he's in mid to late 60's. 

Anways, now back to you......"}

{"text":"Terrible service; it's like it was their first day (or hour) on the job and they had no idea what was going on. All I wanted was a quick cup of soup before class and it took 15 minutes for me to go through the line (there was only one person in front of me, and one behind me during the time I was there). Why did it take so long? It was unbelievable. 

Furthermore, when I expressed my frustration with the situation as I paid, I just got a laugh. Um, okay. I won't be back to this location, ever."}

{"text":"Decent subway location. Located by a Anytime Fitness so you can get some carbs prior to your workout."}
{"text":"Composite.

What I like about Subway is the ability to actually see the food in front of one as it is placed on the sandwiches.  This is a customer-driven quality control feature.  One can see the product, see how it is made, see the level of cleanliness/hygiene, see if gloves are put on and/or changed.... So, from fresh materials in front of one to a sandwich that is either cold or heated -- one can see the entire process.  Frankly, the Subs are healthy compared to the oil ladden products of other \"fast food\" places.  My experience with staff has been they've been friendly and helpful in all instances.

f8 and be there."}
{"text":"Long line when we arrived but it moved quickly.  Seemed to be staffed accordingly.  Employees were friendly and efficient.  Food was OK but not very high expectations since it is Subway."}
{"text":"5 Star rating for how friendly the young gentlemen was that made my sandwich. He came out of the back and welcomed me & informed he was washing his hands and he would be right with me. He was just super nice, and it's unusual in this area. Kudos! His name was Trey incase management is reading this."}
{"text":"We have a complaint. I have the Subway app. We use it at this Subway all the time, we went in with the app showing 2  6 inch sub meals for $10 . Well there was no one there that new anything about how to use the app. Or how to redeem it. How is that possible? We have used the app many times , they was rude wanting to charge $17 for the meal. which is crazy. They charged us that same thing other day and we complained but it did no good. But my husband kept arguing with the guy so he let my husband have it for $11 but still didn't know how to use the app to redeem it. They was rude and I am not happy at all. Thinking of deleting the app and never going to Subway again and we go 1-2 times a week . I am very unhappy . Your employees need to know what they are doing. They was 3-4 people there working and no one knew how to redeem the app , really? How stupid can that be . You might have just lost 2 loyal customers"}
{"text":"I preface this be saying that when I do a review I base it off my own experiences/observations.  It has nothing to do with the race, religion, gender, identity, etc. of anyone who works there lest anyone think otherwise.
It's right around the corner from me so occasionally I would grab a sandwich when I was looking for some quick reasonably priced eats.  It's a Subway so you pretty much know what you're going to get in the terms of quality- not out of this world but not terrible.  And in terms of quality never had any major issues.
The reason I've stopped going is because of the staff particularly the presumed owner as he is the one who's I've interacted with the most.  He is Charlotte's version of the Soup Nazi.  Now to be clear no I haven't seen him kick anyone out of the store with him saying \"No Sub for you\".  But there's a air of discomfort with his interactions with customers and can be prickly in terms of certain requests.  For example- I observed a customer who purchased the six inch special request additional napkins.  He didn't yell but he did make a point to tell the customer he was unhappy with the request.  Basically his point being that she was buying the special she shouldn't be making requests for additional thing as he needed to protect his bottom line.  I've not had any huge incidents but it's more just like in the Seinfeld episode as you proceed through the line there's a tension as you make sure you proceed through the line through the counter encountering staff that by and large isn't terribly friendly.  Apparently from the other reviews others have also had less than friendly experiences.  I finally decided its not worth going someplace where I have to be so concerned about the customer service for something that should be a simple no worry experience.
So proceed with caution when entering this Subway.  If you're looking for a quick sandwich in that area, the 7-11 sandwiches esp. the chicken salad are surprisingly decent.  The nearby dive bars also turn out a good hot sandwich if you're willing to wait a little longer."}
{"text":"Walked into this store and Brandon took me and my fiance's  order and asked what we wanted and I asked about the different breads and looked for the pictures of the breads but he said they don't have the picture any longer but he was happy to show me the actual bread choices.  Right away We knew We were in good hands!  We ordered  our sandwiches, he got everything right.  He asked if we wanted the sandwiches to be cut in half and see if we wanted them wrapped up individually.  He asked if we wanted mayonnaise packets or other condiments on the side and my fiance said \"Oh that would be perfect!\"  My sandwiches won't be soggy for work!  Brandon did a stellar job and we hope he gets promoted to Manager.  My fiance said if there were six stars for the rating that's what we would give, but here are five stars for you Brandon for a job well  done!"}

{"text":"I've been here a few times in the last couple weeks to buy lunches for kids at a local high school. Customer service is terrible. The guys take their jobs as a joke. They get orders wrong and fail to put in pre-orders when you call ahead."}
{"text":"Visited this subway today for two sandwiches. The two employees working, an older woman and a teenage boy, were both very rude and incompetent. It seemed as if I was inconveniencing them by ordering food. I was also using my subway app for the first time and I asked the boy how it works for the QR scanner and he replied \"I don't know\" with an attitude. How do you not know how the Subway app works if you work at Subway? Overall, lousy employees and lousy experience."}
{"text":"A+ location with amazing staff.  Summerlin is an up and coming area in Las Vegas.  This team of employees really go above and beyond.  Everything was super fresh."}
{"text":"This location seems to be our go-to location as they do a good job keeping the restaurant clean, TV's are usually running and easy to change the channels. 

I use this place a lot with the app and every time I show up, it's ready when expected with no delays and I can go straight to the register to be in and out quickly. If I'm not doing the pickup it's still pretty easy to make the order and no issues with the store. 

A good selection of chips (which at times can vary with other places) and the staff has been good when comes to accommodating and informing you of specials you may be interested in. 

Be careful when parking in between Subway and the nearby Mexican Restaurant as it's the drive-thru exit and has limited parking heading toward the front entrance."}
{"text":"Very unpleasant subway employee, sabrina. 
Almost just wanted to leave she was rude and very unfriendly. Didn't ask if I wanted to get a cookie, drink or chips. Didn't ask if I wanted anything toasted. I don't even know if she made one of the sandwiches right, she did it so fast and didn't ask if we wanted everything on it. 
I'll take my business somewhere else next time- won't go back to this store."}
{"text":"I love Subway but the reason why I give this place such a high rating is because of the owner and employees. They are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"It's your typical subway but they seem to be a little less friendly than most. Food is still good for subway standards (which I like a lot) but the seating is a little tight for me. Also the way they orgaized the seating seems a little off for me. I feel like they were trying to cram as many seats in there as possible."}
{"text":"Kinda pissed. Out and about and went to Subway to change my daughters diaper. It's one where they lock the restrooms so only people who buy can use them. So I had to buy cookies just to use the restroom, which fine and I totally understand. I told the lady I needed to change her. She let me into the restroom after i agreed to purchase, knowing full well they did not have changing tables. Am I supposed to lay her down on the nasty floor to change her?  Talked to the manager, who rang me up after...who couldn't be bothered to get off his cell phone and all he could say was, ya we dont have those. I asked for a number to contact the owner and was told that it wouldn't do any good. He then handed me his cell phone telling the person on the other end to \"talk to this lady.\" No clue who I spoke with but she had zero empathy and just stated multiple times that it isn't Subways policy to have a changing table so they don't have to have one in the restroom. Not a single person apologized that I was mislead or was even treated with a single ounce of empathy. Needless to say Subway is now on my list of no go anymore."}

Worst. Service. Experience. Ever. The lady who works here was grouchy (I came here 3 times and she was not friendly during any of those visits). It got to a point where her grouchiness made me feel uncomfortable, rubbed off on me, and I also made me angry for no good reason.

Average quality for a Subway location.

6'' Sub of the Day - $3.97 (after taxes) - I got the tuna sub and it tasted okay. I always get the same toppings & sauce & it tasted like a standard sandwich from Subway.

When we entered the restaurant the man behind the counter was very cheerful and welcoming. My mother and I were the only customers in there and as I was deciding what to order 2 younger girls double parked in the very first parking spaces and walked in. Assuming they were customers I politely moved out of the way to let them go ahead of me. They were very loud and one of the girls actually ran right into me (not lightly I might add). With no apology or even acknowledgment that I was there she kept walking and entered the employee area. The other girl who had entered with her remained on the customer side of the restaurant. I continued to order my food, and had to keep repeating my order louder and louder because the girl who had plowed into me was so obnoxiously deafening. Then the obnoxious girl (who was completely ignoring my order) started serving her friend she had entered with. RUDE! This employee is a horrible representation of customer service!"}

Had a long line and I waited - like everyone else - sandwich makers asking about choices etc - then get to the very rude male cashier. 

The credit card machine was down. 

I get it. It happens. It's not your fault. 

In fact it's almost as much not your fault that the machine is down as it is MY fault that you don't have a 'Plan B' for these types of situations. Like remember those old swipe impression machines? They were there for times like this. 

And I get it. You guys take cash. Well guess what. I don't operate on cash. On average I have about as much cash on me as I do checks. 

As in 0. 

So instead of thinking with your head. You take my sandwich - which has been made to my liking and throw it away. 

I leave hungry (and mad... I.e. - this review) you waste the food (and same amount of money that you had 'invested' in that sandwich) and no one gets anything. 

Wasn't asking for a 'free' sandwich. (Although it was TOTALLY not my fault for any of this). But perhaps come up with a 'Plan B' for when the machine goes down....

But don't worry.... I left this review. Been tweeting a lot and Facebook'd the crap out of this. So hopefully you lost me and a few other folks who really did like Jersey Mikes, just found Subway closer."}

SUPER unprofessional.  He proceeded to not listen/understand what I told him.  I had to repeat myself several times to get anything.  I told him I wanted extra tomatoes, as many as he could give me.  He gave me one.  Not one extra, one tomato total.  He gave me two slices of cheese, not even covering the whole 6\" sub and had to ask for more.  I said a TINY bit of yellow mustard and even gestured \"TINY\" with my fingers.  He LATHERED it in mustard thus ruining my sandwich.  He didn't speak English very well and that is probably a big contributing factor.  This will be my last time going to that location."}

Dont bother saying light onion or heavy cucumber bc they just pile on as much as they can in the 2 seconds they give u to answer them. They always make me feel like I'm bothering them at work and NOBODY smiles. I gave 2 stars bc they will accept expired coupons. Half the veggies are frozen and they run out of dressings almost anytime i go there. Today was the final straw on this location... go the extra .3 miles to a different location"}
{"text":"Subway is Subway. Some people hate it, some people love it, and some, like me, tolerate it when there's a need for a quick and inexpensive lunch. This location literally just opened a few days ago, and as expected, the staff was really cheery and ready to please. Everything was also *really* clean. After a few months, I'm sure they'll be jaded and not be as attentive to the specific ways each person wants their sandwich prepared. Regarding the quality of the food, the produce, meat, and cheese were actually quite fresh. However, the bread was definitely not freshly baked and was actually quite stale. I'm sure I'll be back for more quick, inexpensive lunches, and the current $5/footlong promotion is actually quite a steal."}

The shift lead Angel, took my order, which was a ham,egg & cheese sandwich. The menu states it is $2.50 yet he charged me for a Western Egg sandwich making my total for just the sandwich $3.79.

I'm not sure why they were so skimpy since it's not like it was a premium meat but I'm really glad I ordered a lot of veggies because this is really unacceptable. The tuna was put on the top part which I really didn't understand that logic and was so thin I could barely taste it. See  pic."}
{"text":"It's ridiculous how many Subway franchises exist in Downtown Pittsburgh. Even more ridiculous is that there are two on Penn Avenue, blocks from each other! 

We know their food is passable at best, I myself having been burned out on their sandwiches long ago. However, as I've stated recently about area Subways, particularly those in the city proper, they at the very least provide a clean restroom when you most need it. 

After meeting Kay for lunch at her employer's cafeteria, I headed to the T station (how ironic?), and well, nature called. 

So I walked into this Subway location and asked if I could buy a cookie. When I told them that I just needed to use the facilities, the \"artist\" waved her hand, told me it was unlocked, and let me use it. 

I bought a cookie anyway since they aren't terribler and because I want to keep these places friendly for this sort of thing. After all, you're using their water, soap, and hand-dryer. 

I know it seems odd to review Subways for this reason, but...1) the bathroom was spotless. 2)I remember when Subways insisted that someone purchase something (and many still do) before they'd provide a bathroom key due the homeless and drug-addled abusing this privilege. 3) The lack of public restrooms in urban hubs is a little-discussed problem...

http://americanrestroom.org/pr/benefits.htm

Hell, I don't usually mind shelling out 65 cents to use the restroom, but its nice to know that I don't always need to, and I will keep buying those cookies so that those who can't buy them always have a safe, clean place to relieve their bladders and bowels.

P.S. This Subway shares a street address with...Seviche? That's gotta be a mistake. I know it's next door."}
{"text":"This past Saturday night, after dining at NOLA (stay tuned True Believers!) and before seeing Lewis Black at Heinz Hall, I needed to use a bathroom. 

You're gettin' that deja-vu feelin' (see my review of The O and the Subway nearby), aren't ya?

I went in, told the young, blonde, foreign woman --whose English-speaking skills were just fine-- my situation, and offered to buy a cookie since cheapskates and riff-raffs often abuse the courtesy of a clean restroom. 

She said, \"No hon. If you gotta go, you gotta go!\"

After I was finished, I came out and offered to buy a cookie regardless. 

She gave it to me for free with a cloud-clearing smile on her kind face.  

\"What? A 20?\"

\"But I should break it anyway.\"

\"Don't verry about it!\"

I may no longer like their sandwiches as much as I did when I was a younger man, but their customer service of late can't be topped. 

It's not just about commerce; it's about common decency."}
{"text":"Two back-to-back late concert nights caused me to forget to pack a lunch the other morning, so reluctantly I headed to the Subway on Wood Street prior to hopping aboard my bus. 

Yeah, I suppose Joe is right. Ya can't expect much out of Subway, BUT when my flatbread foot-long sub of tuna, bacon, and avocado AND my two cookies and bottles of iced tea come to over $15 (!!), I should come away feeling more than just full for the moment. 

Let's talk about that flatbread. It had been introduced in the years since my Subway exile borne of burnout and settling for less, which means that it is new to me. 

Bit into a rubber kitchen counter mat. That's Subway's flatbread.

Now, the tuna itself is decent, especially when coupled with their acceptable, microwaved bacon, cheese triangles, and ranch dressing, but *gulp* that \"avocado\" product is below banal.

They can cut fresh veggies but have to serve the avocado in a bag, mashed-up into something resembling guacamole, and squeeeeeeeze it onto your sandwich. The young man behind the counter nuked mine first since it was frozen.

I can dig the chewy cookies, however. 

I'd honestly give them a 3 had my tab been less that 15 dollars, which is an obscenity considering what you are served here. Ack. Stay far away."}
{"text":"Since Subways are ubiquitous, I might as well do an obligatory review of my neighborhood franchise even though it has been a few months since I got anything here. Subway can burn a guy out, so I've generally been avoiding them. 

Though I must confess to liking...

The Meatball Marinara

The Chicken and Bacon Ranch

The Tuna

And their various cookies and fresh baked bread. 

Yes, the subs are all good toasted.

This Subway also appears to be exploiting immigrant labor. They'll have the same accented person seemingly working 7 days a week. 

I recall being excited when Subways first started opening in Pittsburgh (I think the one Downtown on Smithfield Street was my first) back in the late 80's since I have always had a jones for fresh deli subs. I still remember when they used to cut a wedge out of the top of the bread loaf instead of cutting it along the side. 

Everything else is pretty soulless, though. But it is cheap and supposedly healthy food. 

Subway, there are too many of you, really. Does there need to be one in every fracking neighborhood?"}
{"text":"Lovers of food love to hate Subway, and I grew weary of them over time as well, but I have a hot tip for y'all regarding this particular franchise.

It's right down the street from The Original Hot Dog Shop, and anyone who knows \"The O\" knows to avoid their bathrooms. I lunched there yesterday afternoon for the first time in over 20 years, and while the bathroom was not as foul as I remembered, the gentleman's stall had no door on it.

So to Subway I walked. The chap behind the counter didn't even ask me to buy anything in order to use the restroom (many Subway proprietrs want you to purchase something before they'll give you a key), but I advise you to at least purchase a cookie (just 52 cents) in order to keep management copacetic about area diners using their facilities. 

And MAN, was that bathroom cleaner than a drill sergeant's private quarters!

Whew! Thanks Subway. 

P.S. There are 4 Subways in Oakland! 4!

P.P.S. Consider my rating one based on sterling customer service and convenience alone. Those cookies aren't half-bad either."}
{"text":"Bellisario's owns ye all. Your  pathetic \"subs\" are no match for Bellisario's hoagies. Fall, Subway, fall...

And Jared's a dweeb of the highest order. Has there ever been a worse pitchman?"}
{"text":"My theory on the current fast food crisis: Raise the minimum wage, and the levels of service will improve. 

Tonight, this particular franchise had no cookies, flippant employees, and bread that was cut improperly, falling apart as I munched through a tuna sub. A knife and fork was almost required, but guess what? They were out of plasticware too! I doubt getting paid $8 an hour provides much incentive to do a better job. 

And Jared's still a dweeb."}
{"text":"The two young women that worked here found me very amusing for some reason. In fact, they found anyone who didn't speak their language amusing. Why? Beats me.  

Oh, maybe it's because people keep buying this swill. It's cheap and ubiquitous after all. 

Hey, stop it! My mom was buying, ok? 

Well, this one at least (dunno about the others) has a deal after 5PM where you get 2 footlongs for $10. So, one tuna and one chicken bacon ranch sandwich later, and the 'rents and I were full. 

I feel guilty since several decent-to-excellent pizza joints are nearby this Subway, including one on either side of it.

Subways must being making insane coinage. They are everywhere. Joy.

Damn, I remember when Subways first came to Pittsburgh. I was still in high school and was so excited since it was something new and different. Now, the magic...is long gone."}
{"text":"Was in the area and stopped at this location just before noon. One customer in front of me. The two women were more interested in talking to him. One finally ask for my order. Three times she asked me if I wanted my sandwich toasted and each time I refused. She started to charge me for the other customer's order. She got an attitude when I corrected her. She wouldn't hand me my change and just dropped it on the counter. After getting home I realized why she was so insistent on toasting because the bread was stale. After two bites, I threw it away. I've tried several Subways in the area and I'm done. There is no quality control and thd employees don't want to work. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went here at 330p on Friday for the featured sandwich \"Italian hero\". Was told by the clerk they were out of most of the meats needed. On a Friday afternoon near dinner time. Either this,store is poorly run or they don't want to make sandwiches with multiple ingredients. Went to another subway a few minutes away and they gladly nads my sandwich. Don't waste your time with this store."}
{"text":"Store was clean and the clerk was very attentive. Made my sandwich, bread and ingredients were fresh. I went here after another Subway was out of the ingredients for featured sandwich."}
{"text":"Good luck trying to get the order right. The clerks are either high school kids that don't care or don't understand English. Twice I told them I didn't want the sandwich toasted and they kept toasting it anyway. They didn't listen to what I wanted on the sandwichs.  I finally left them abd walked out. Don't waste your time unless your getting the featured sandwich. It seems that all they wanf to make."}
{"text":"Worst customer  service they were not eaering clean clothes and got the order wrong. Did not write on the sandwich wrappers. If i could give no star i would"}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong with Subway. It's also hard to write a unique review for them; if you've been to one, you've been to them all.

I pop in this location for lunch at least once a week, and I've yet to have a bad experience. Unlike Bowl of Greens next door, there's never a huge lunch rush, and the staff are fantastic. Definitely not the norm for fast food in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Two people working at dinner rush time, multiple times went into the back room for quite an extended period of time. My mom was waiting around 45 minutes in line just to order a couple cookies. The guy behind us ended up leaving due to the wait time. And the people in front of us didn't have any sort of \"complicated\" order whatsoever. 

Two workers made absolutely zero effort to assist everyone, made zero attempts to apologize, and visibly goofed off during the whole thing. Best of all, the girl ringing us up was very mean, snide, and gave us the wrong cookies. 

I'm very disappointed because this location has never done something like this, they really hired the wrong people I'm afraid. Either learn how to manage yourself in a busy period and keep working, or find another line of work not involving customer service."}
{"text":"Really terrible immature staff. No training on customer service. Opt for the one on 51st and Baseline instead. Much more pleasant!"}
{"text":"Not my first choice of locations being that I don't need to be in a veritable mosh pit of people yelling at their kids or looking lost in general inside, and vagrants hounding you outside. 

Nestled in an odd plaza containing coin launders, along with an eclectuc mix of oddities such as shoes for under $5, and a furniture store housing who knows what. (IKEA eat your heart out!) Though the location is clean and contains standard Subway fare, you won't be catching me hanging out killing time with my mp3 player or surfing Yelp on my tablet."}
{"text":"Buzzing south on I-17 on our way back to Tucson, the wife and I were looking for something cheap and fast and actually agreed (that almost never happens) we were not in the mood for the usual fast food burger. We saw the signs from the freeway promising Subway at exit blah, blah, blah so we take that exit.

It's tucked in the back behind an Albertsons, a Chevron and, of course, a McDonalds so we had to hunt for it  a little bit. The place was clean, we got our food fast (which was good and fresh), hoovered it down and were back on the road in no time.

I tend to forget about Subway as a whole, but I enjoyed my sandwich enough that it may just have put them back on my radar when I am looking for a non-burger/burrito option that's cheap and fast. We make this trip fairly often so we'll store this location in our memory banks for the future."}
{"text":"Last night the boyfriend and I hit up subway and he decided to go nutz with his sandwich. I mean \"lets try to make sure the sandwich doesn't close hahaha\"  The guy making his sandwich asked how much of everything he wanted and guess what? The guy actually piled on the toppings, which made me nervous cause I'm gonna have to deal with the *consequences* of my boyfriends gluttony! The guy who made the sandwiches were making us laugh and made the sandwiches EXACTLY the way we wanted them.

I can still see the sandwich bursting open with hundreds of little jalapeños! hahaha definitely one of the best trips to Subway I've ever had."}
{"text":"Probably the worse subway I have eaten at. The bread on 3 sandwiches we ordered was stale and falling apart. Service was slow and the restroom was scary. I was very disappointed with this visit.  Subway is eaten often, not sure I'll ever come back to this one."}
{"text":"Here during Chocolate Affair Event.  All of the tables are dirty.  I understand it is busy during special events but they can't spare 5 minutes to wipe down the tables?"}
{"text":"I sometimes stop here after the gym when I'm simply too lazy to go home and make my own dinner. The store is small, but I've never seen it dirty or anything along those lines.

Service is friendly and efficient ."}
{"text":"I made the fatal mistake of forgetting to pack my lunch before leaving the house.

Luckily for me, I was able to jump off the light rail and grab a quick lunch.

The inside of the restaurant was small but it was clean and the staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Subway is nothing out of the ordinary, but what I will say is that it is considerably easier to eat healthier here vs other fast food chains.

This location is typically filled with employees from the surrounding courthouse along with customers from the light rail station. 

One thing about this location is that the hours are a bit shorter, but it is to be expected. Service is average and efficient."}
{"text":"Subway is where I go when I am tired of the usual offerings found on the strip. lt's located in the Monte Carlo casino and open 24 hours a day.

The food isn't anything special, but it is fresh which is a nice change of pace .I've always found the service to be adequate and quick."}
{"text":"Wow, was I surprised today, the lady behind the counter made me a solid sub. I was expecting mediocre cause of the last visit a couple of years ago where it was crap. 
But maybe things have changed and she made me a really good sub, she wasn't stingy on the toppings. So I felt they deserved a review. 

I had the veggie patty sub and I like to load it with everything cause that's just the way I like it.

I will try them again and hope it was as good as today's."}
{"text":"The food is typical subway food, always consistant, but the service is terrific.  The weekday lunch time workers are without exception friendly and pleasant.    Great job, team."}
{"text":"With this location being near the strip you would think they would have at least 2 employees at all times..."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The employees did not speak good english, and were upset that this whiteboy speaks spanish. It was not a good guest experience, and they were rude. If I had the time to stop elsewhere, I would have walked out. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"This Subway location is the best! Dino & Jeronimo are real sandwich artist! They make your sandwich with love and just the way you love it! I've worked subway back in California and I know how much work it can be! It's crazy because there is a close subway to my house. Yet they are very rude and sloppy! I will drive the extra miles to get my fresh sandwich! If you want a Subway sandwich go here they do it right!!! Gracias Dino and Jeronimo buen Trabajo!!"}
{"text":"Yes, I confess, I eat more Subway than I would care to admit. I will blame the husband, who has a serious Subway thang. However, there are times when I desperately need something to eat, and I just want it quickly and to be fresh-like. Enter Subway toppings! It's a salad on bread. When I need to kick start my morning, I am going for the egg whites, just load on the veggies and a squirt of mustard. 

We used to go to another location in our hood, but we recently branched out. Glad we did. This location is super clean, well-managed and open 24-hours. I could seriously tell appreciate a difference. This Subway cares. Plus, if you like to mix your fresh-like with your dough-like, there's a Winchell's inside too. Nothing quite beats a veggie sub and glazed doughnut combo! Just kidding, I personally don't do that. But, hey, it is possible here."}
{"text":"I have admitted it before: in a starvation crunch, Subway is on my list of sustenance. How do I judge a Subway? By how many times I have to ask, \"Can I have a little more [insert topping]?\" It is humiliating to beg a sandwich artist for a few more onions, a couple more pickles, a... eventually you just hang your head in shame and accept the measly toppings they are doling out. This happens to me more often than not at this particular location. You get the feeling they are being watched, and if they give you more than the acceptable allocation of jalapenos, something bad may happen to them. It's not a good feeling to have when you're simply trying to concoct a subway sandwich with ample onions"}
{"text":"This place sucks go to the one on horizon and horizon. Staff is rude and slow. I was the only one waiting online and the staff are talking about the dirty water and how it freezes under the meat/cheese tubs. Like if you have a customer, shut up and serve them. Sandwich guy was improperly trained cause he didnt even know how to prep the sandwiches (subway club) and no he didnt seem"}
{"text":"Health eating!!!   Clean restaurant friendly staff. Classic subway never disappoints."}
{"text":"Great restaurant... the place was spotless the bathrooms were super clean as well. Subway food is great.. the employees were friendly.. This is the best subway on this side of town hands down... To the owner/manager well done!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow great customer service!!!!! Hannah and Faith both are excellent.  
Our first time to try the Reuben and yum! It's good! Obviously the bread is not grilled but I am sure it is healthier. :) this subway is very clean inside and out and the restrooms are spotless.  
Music pleasant and not too loud to visit.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our first time at this subway. I was  quite impressed with Zack.  He is very nice and he did a great job making our sandwiches.  This restrauant is clean and the music was not too loud. We will definitely  cone here again!"}
{"text":"Great experience!! I for the breakfast wheat flat bread and the flat bread was the freshest I have ever had at any Subway!!!! Delicious. My husband got the tuna on wheat flat bread and said the same thing!! Kendrick& Tristan - servers are both very friendly, efficient, and precise. Very good experience!! We will be back for sure. The restaurant is also very clean and the music not too loud. Great jobs guys!!"}
{"text":"I buy from here as well as my coworkers and I sit here after work to wait for my daughter to pick me up and Brenda kicked me out! Not like I'm homeless or disorderly. To top it off my daughter went to talk to the girl and they yelled at her so it became a shouting match."}
{"text":"Every single time we place a mobile order here, something is missing or done incorrectly. We have gotten to a point where we won't even do a mobile anymore and just will have to walk in and take our time giving them the order so nothing is missed.  That being said, the food is always good."}
{"text":"Showed up at 7:55 to ensure I got in as close to 8:00 AM as possible to feed myself and my employees.  At 8:00 flat a truck rolled up and a lady sprinted out and unlocked the door.  I gave her a few minutes as it seems she was the first to show up.  At 8:05 I walked in and inquired if they were open, I was given a response I did not understand.  I asked when I could get a sandwich, she said 15 minutes.
I had already been away from work linger than I could have because I showed up 5 minutes early.

I now am back at work, hungry, pissed off, and empty handed and had to give bad news to my hungry employees.

Thank you for not feeding me and leaving me hungry!!!"}
{"text":"Management (and customers) please take note.
We just walked out of the door after having ordered 2 subs to go, 30ish minutes before the 10pm posted closing time. 

When we walked in to order at 9:17pm we were told they were closing. We asked what time they closed and were told 9:30pm (30 minutes prior to actual closing mind you). 

The subs were slapped together like they didn't care and we had to ask for more veggies, as the first go was skimpy. 

Please speak to your employees. They should provide service to people and treat them the way they would want to be treated."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here on Monday evening (and I suspect this is reoccurring). The two workers - 1 gal, possibly another gal were less than helpful and clearly didn't care one bit about customer service. No \"hello\" upon walking in and no \"thank you\" upon leaving. Very brash and terse when asking about sub choice/toppings. The sandwiches were slapped together (ex: roast beef slices clumped on the sandwich and a handful of onions piled on). 

The attitude of the sandwich maker made it clear she did not want to be there. My first intuition was to walk out, and I should have!!! We used to visit this location a while back - this place has seriously gone down hill. Such a shame. Ownership - I hope you take these reviews seriously and attitude check your employees before you lose even more business!"}
{"text":"During a layover, the GF and I decided to split a $5 footlong breakfast sub with egg and cheese. We loaded it up with veggies (green peppers, olives, lettuce, tomatoes, spinach) and melded this all together with some of the chipotle mayo. 

The fresh veggies and the somewhat spicy chipotle mayo (no lingering burn here) definitely made the sandwich. 

This wasn't bad at all - in fact - it was pretty good. Definitely filling for what was only $5. Could see myself grabbing one of these again in a pinch."}
{"text":"Wanted a sandwich with soft bread, the board was broken so this young man took my order by hand. The sandwich was excellent,  the service was fast and he was friendly too. Price was good as well,  he even talked me in to getting a larger sandwich then I first asked for.  Keep this employee, he's a good one!"}
{"text":"Twice a year the Fountain Hills Coin Club has its annual Coin Show.  For each show we usually order 6-foot subs from this Subway.  For our show this past Saturday, I was in charge of getting the food.  I ordered a 6-foot and a 3-foot sub.  I was very pleased with the quality of the food and the quality of the service.  I made the order a week in advance.  I called 2 days before the show to confirm the order and the guy answering the phone knew all about the order.  Payment was easy and the subs were available at the specified time on Sunday.  All the vendors and volunteers at the Coin Show loved the subs.  Thank you very much!!!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my previous 4-star review and downgrading it to 2 stars for dishonesty in advertising.  Today I ordered the new 6 inch Autumn Carved Turkey sandwich and only 2 slices of turkey were put on it.  I pointed out to the manager on duty that the picture on the menu board clearly shows 3 slices of turkey.  But he said only 2 slices of turkey come on the sandwich.  I think this is very dishonest of Subway to advertise one thing and deliver something less.  I will certainly eat at Subway less often from now on."}
{"text":"This place never has enough staff so it takes forever to get through the line. Every time I've been there the pop machine is also broken."}
{"text":"Fast , polite , Nathaniel working behind the counter does his job right . I just want a sandwich and be in n out... he helped me accomplish that. Will be returning"}
{"text":"There were multiple times where I came in with my BF and friends during midnight (or later) and no one would be present. Wait time would be around 10-15 minutes in their lobby and we'd just leave. Music is on and so are the lights so we didn't understand why a 24/7 subway wouldn't be open? Will update my review once I get to experience their service and food at this location."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Subway regularly for at least a year.  The subs are great, what you would typically expect from a Subway, and the store is clean and well-kept.  The staff is always there to greet you with a smile and everyone is upbeat.

I'm a big fan of their efficiency most of the time.  I'm typically in a rush to get in and out as soon as possible as the shopping plaza can get busy during the lunch rush hour and I'm usually stopping in between meetings.  The staff do a great job at keeping things quick and efficient, which keeps me coming back.  If you're a fan of Subway or healthy sandwiches in general, this is a great location to frequent."}
{"text":"It's Subway, but in Cross Plains, it's great to have a simple, safe option when grabbing a bite to eat.  With Culver's next door, we can grab a little from each place and make everyone happy."}
{"text":"It's take your son/Daughter to work day! My son was excited he spotted the subway and said we have to go there mom. We walked in no line thought to ourselves this is great. Our order was taken by Tommy. Everything was fine until we moved to the next employee. 
I'm only concerned on how organized they are on the line, the second person was moving sandwiches around and confused everyone back there. Besides being unorganized the line was getting backed up the client behind me had a bit of a language barrier and the employees seemed to be bothered to help him I thought he was answering correctly and you could clearly understand him. ( I know because he spoke Spanish  but his broken English was fine) But Tommy made it a point to make several jokes knowing he wouldn't understand. Making all other customer laugh at this customer. 

My 13 year old son was offended and said that guy is so mean. Not the experience I was looking for. He didn't even want to eat there. Said \"I don't want to keep hearing that guy mom.\"

I'm offended for that customer. 

Suggestion: maybe have a bit more of customer service training. Not assume all clients know how to order at subway. Be more human. 

When I asked the cashier who was the manager he said I'm the Assistant Manager I asked for his name CJ and he didn't bother to ask why I asked to resolve my concern. He obviously heard the remarks made and didn't take action. 

I don't like writing negative reviews but some work needs to happen. In the picture posted with my check in is the gentleman being harassed by the employees. 

The one star is because my food was ok."}
{"text":"I see a lot of negative reviews so I was a little nervous to come here, but I have to say I had a great experience. Idk if it was because there was no one else there but the wait wasn't long at all in the drive thru. Mine and my bf's sandwich came out good...the bread was fresh...I would definitely come back. The girl who took our order was so sweet too!"}
{"text":"It's Subway, so you know what to expect. However, some Subways are better than others, and this is one of the better ones. It's always clean and the owner seems to be on the ball. And they always have those chocolate chip cookies ready (not the case for every Subway.)

The only reason for the four stars opposed to five is the constant turnover for employees, which can make ordering slow at times because someone new is often being trained. 

Overall, if you're looking for a clean and reliable Subway, this location should be considered."}
{"text":"It's a 5 for Subway. After many road trips, I have learned that not all Subways are the same. I have seen impeccably clean and I have seen roaches scampering across the floor (that was off I-95 in Georgia). This Subway is clean and sports a 97.5 rating on that front. That's not All-Star Subway status, but it's a solid performance.

As you can see from the picture, I got a turkey sandwich and a chocolate chip cookie. I actually got two chocolate chip cookies because I brought one home for my son. Little did he know, I ate the one with more chocolate chips. Evil? Debatable. When chocolate chip cookies are around, I might have a chance at fighting off John Cena.

If you're cruising on I-77 on an interstate trip, have never even heard of Huntersville, and you're searching for a good Subway to \"fill up,\" then this spot should be strongly considered. 

Important Note: This location always has soft chocolate chip cookies. The Subway off Ex. 23 does not."}
{"text":"I just had the best Subway experience I have ever had. The manager seemed to know everyone who came in and for some reason people asked him about his magic. Which when I got to the register prompted me to ask as well. I'm so glad I did. I love Subway, but I also love magic. Lemme just say this was an amazing visit, and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Both women working were rude to me and my friend yet extremely friendly to other customers in the store. Snappy as i was trying to order, and hardly spoke loud enough for me to hear over the glass while ordering. I will absolutely not go back to this store."}
{"text":"I love when Hanin is here. The entire store is always completely clean and quiet. My sandwiches taste better when she makes them. She is very nice. She is always working hard. Pretty smart and likes Star Wars like me. She deserves a raise seriously."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 sandwiches, the guy cutting my bread cut his finger with the knife while slicing the bread. He had blood running down his hand. He went to the back and the other employee came over to help. She grabbed the same knife off of the counter and the same piece of bread and started to finish the cut. I asked her to please use a different knife. She said \"oh yeah\" and put the knife that cut the guy back on the counter in front of my sandwiches. I did pay for my sandwiches but as I drove off decided I didn't want to take any chances so I went over to another restaurant to get food and threw the subs away. Who knows what knife they used for the guests who were walking in as I left. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"It feels goofy to review a Subway but I was on here to review a restaurant and saw how low this rating was.

Habib and Zahra are great.  Courteous, friendly, not stingy with the toppings.  Never had such good service at a restaurant like this other than this location.

The other staff, well they're of varying degrees of decency, depending on the mood."}
{"text":"Subway used to give out little \"Subway Club\" cards.  Each time you bought a sub, you got a little stamp.  Fill up the card, you got a free sub.  You can't drive a mile in any direction without bumping into a Subway, and the food is fairly healthy, so I used to eat there a lot.  Maybe once a week.   

One day, with a card full of stamps, I headed up to this Subway on my lunch break.  Salivating over the thought of a delicious turkey sub, I got through the line and presented my card.

Manager-looking guy, running the register: \"Uh, we can't take this.\"

Me:  \"Why not?  It's filled with the requisite number of stamps.\"

Manager:  \"Yeah, but they are from different Subways.\"

Me:  \"...\"

Manager:  \"We don't want to give away free sandwiches if you didn't buy your sandwiches here.  We have a different colored stamp than all the other restaurants so we can tell.\"

I was caught.  My evil plan, to travel around the world collecting stamps from various Subway locations in order to scam this particular Subway out of one measly sandwich, was foiled.  I had spent days crossing the United States on foot, lost a small fortune flying from continent to continent, and had lost three toes to frostbite in the frozen tundra.  All so that I could be sure I would not spend any money in this particular store, so that my free sandwich would be, in fact, stolen goods.

Now I know how Doctor Doom feels when he's defeated by the Fantastic Four.  Like that one issue when Doctor Doom is hungry and Mr. Fantastic is being a jerk for no reason."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here for dinner tonight. It's 7:30 and prime dinner time. No meatballs are ready? Makes no sense business-wise."}
{"text":"I always drive pass 5-7 locations on my way here because each time I come here the service is amazing and they really pack the sandwiches the way I like it. Extremely clean location and their has always been a worker sweeping or wiping down tables when I visit. Francia I believe was our sandwich maker and she handled our order professionally which isn't something I usually say for a fast food restaurant! Ingredients are always fresh and they always have fresh cookies and soft bread! Love this location 10/10 each time so far."}
{"text":"I have come to this location for years, after tonight I'm not sure I will be frequently visiting again. They are open until 11, we entered at 10:13. No hi, hello, how are you.... instead (from the employee wearing an Arby's name tag that said Adam) just \"how many subs? What size? What kind of bread\" and then without looking up ...once.... continues to make the food and throw the toppings on the bread!! This was awful customers service!!"}
{"text":"So, I wanted a sandwich. Went to subway. Ordered a wrap and instead of getting a sandwich that you'd normally want, this guy proceeded to literally dump a huge layer of mayo and mustard I to a half ass put together caveman of a wrap. Thanks subway! Going to jersey Mike's from now on."}
{"text":"Bought 4 subs the topping looked dry &old ask the worker she just said wasn't busy today ask why don't you put covers over the toppings she said too busy even thou she said not busy today. I wouldn't come back here l would drive a bit further to get something fresher than this place."}
{"text":"Went in to get a SUB since it is a SUB shop, I mean for goodness sakes it is called SUBway, and they didn't even have any sub bread. Just flat bread. Ridiculous. Not going again."}
{"text":"I walked in with a friend of mine and there were only 2 employees working. I didn't catch any names but my receipt says Randall on it. I'm assuming Randall was the cashier. And if so he was great. You could tell he was working hard. Along with the lady that was working. The line was long and it took a little bit for us to have us taken care of but there was also a guy in front of us who ordered 4 foot longs. So really they were moving as fast as they could. They even gave a discount at the end of the purchase for having to wait. After the line was gone and we were sitting down eating the cashier came out and asked us how our food was. Lovely :)"}
{"text":"Just got home from picking up a kids meal for my daughter and she can't even eat it because it's so stale... she had to dump all of the toppings on to plate and eat it like a salad because the bread is inedible"}
{"text":"Went into subway for quick lunch break there was 2 people ahead of me and they only had one person at store making subs and doing register. The employee never changed her gloves after making sub and handling register and money. The sub was super good but short staffed and need to change gloves after every sub. Other than that good lunch"}
{"text":"Alrighty, we get here and only one girl was working a big order. So it took forever just to get our order started.
Finally a guy named Jorge comes out of the bathroom or whatever, and goes in to take our order. He starts out asking what we want and is just flat out rude the entire time. Didn't even say hello was demanding us to give him our order. I give him my order and I told him exactly what I wanted but he got a phone call on his personal phone and left to go answer the call. So the girl took over, and I had to repeat my order and she gave me crap for telling her spinach last. Um she chose to put it last, I simply called out the items and she could have put it on first if she wanted.
She also came from the back where she was stocking up chicken trays into a container. She wasn't gonna switch her gloves when she was gonna do my order until I asked her if she was getting new gloves.
She goes yeah I'll change them if you want, I was just doing the chicken.
Like HELLO. Especially if you're doing chicken so I want your gloves changed. That should be automatic, homegirl.
The sodas are flat as well.

Overall super annoyed with Jorge thinking his phone call is more important than doing his job."}
{"text":"Very prompt with great service. If you're looking to get a late night snack and are trying to stay away from fries then this is where you should go. 

This place is also very clean. I usually walk out of subways as soon as I notice they are dirty.

{"text":"Subway is Subway. It's pretty healthy and great no matter what anyone says. Plus it's cheap. This place does get super busy around lunch time so I would recommend going before or after the 12 o'clock hour."}
{"text":"Came in at 2pm on wednesday the 29th of March.

Same woman that lied to me last time I dealt with her tried to claim footlongs only get 5 slices of meat. I have personally seen the manager tell other employees there that it is 8 slices to a footlong. Everywhere I check online confirms 8 slices as well. 

She either needs to be fired or put on track about the number of slices because she is the only employee there that puts 5 slices to a footlong."}
{"text":"Gets the job done in a rush. This location is particularly well staffed and quick."}
{"text":"Love this place and the costumer service provided. They are always clean, fast and efficient. All the qualities I look for when getting food in a hurry to feed my family."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would, because this place is a joke.  These people obviously need to find a different line of work. I eat subway a couple times a week and I shouldn't have to tell someone that 8 pieces of meat go on a footlong turkey especially since she said she's been there over a year and the first bite I take shouldn't make my whole sandwich fall apart. It is not like they put a descent amount of anything in the sub. I had ordered 3 sandwiches and all of them were just thrown together, the ladies behind the counter kept rolling there eyes at me and when I said I wanted some of my veggies toasted on the sandwich she looked at me like deer in the headlights. I just recently moved into the area and it's 1 and done with this subway location. I will go out of my way to get subway from a different location, because this place is ridiculous. The only thing I enjoyed about this place was leaving the godawful place. I will never return to this subway location!"}
{"text":"This subway has always given us a great experience. The employees make eye contact and actually listen to what you say. They take there time making the sandwich they don't just throw everything on there and call it good. They are a true subway artist."}
{"text":"This subway is terrible and they're never ready when they open! I went at 7:08 and they still didn't have the open sign on and when I got into the store they had to get all the stuff out!"}
{"text":"Went too get dinner for my son and I and decided too stop at Subway.
I ordered 2 footlong toasted BLT heros.
The staff where very friendly and fast and very helpful.
Sandwiches where delicious and prices are good.
I was in and out in 5 minutes and could not complain about anything.
I would definitely go to this Subway again"}
{"text":"They always seem to have a deal on meatball subs (1.99 6 inch), and the employees really make the subs look nice. We come here once in awhile and are never disappointed.

Note - that \"sweet onion sauce\" or whatever it is - will probably be fine on a 6\". It gets a bit cloying after awhile. You've been warned."}
{"text":"This subway is the WORST subway I've ever been to. 

I commuted to UTM ( University of Toronto in Mississauga) for 4 years, and I would find myself stopping in to this subway regularly as it was on the way.

There was a day when I walked in with my girlfriend, and ordered breakfast sandwiches. As we began to eat, my girlfriend noticed a LARGE FRUIT FLY in her meal. 

As a loyal customer, I expected the OWNER, who made our subs and who I got to know well over the years, to atleast apologize. He did not apologize. Instead he made up some bogus excuse as to why the fly was found in the sub. 

After downplaying the situation, he didn't even offer to remake it! This guy is so dam CHEAP. I can't believe to think how much he cheats out on the quality. Ive filed a report with subway in this issue.

I've spent thousands at this location. Not a penny more going forward from that day. Also I make an effort to tell people about this awful experience."}
{"text":"I have only gone to this location once, and it was AWFUL.  When the guy came to take my order he didn't even ask me what I wanted, and he didn't greet me or say anything.  He just stared at me, like \"what do you want?\"  When I ordered, he still refused to say anything.  In the middle of my sandwich, he realized they were out of lettuce.  Even though I didn't want lettuce, he stopped making my food and went to the back to refill it.  Since I was the only customer in the store, he could have waited until he finished my sandwich.  He said about 3 words to me the entire time I was there, and acted like he was annoyed that I had such nerve walking into his store.  I was also frustrated that the lids were not properly stacked at the drink station.  Slow service and bad customer service add up to a horrible business!"}
{"text":"This Subway is convenient to my work so I probably stop by at least once a week. It's clean and the owner & employees are friendly (like I said, they see me at least once a week). For some reason when I go to Subway I usually try to eat fairly healthy, you know, wheat bread & lots of veggie toppings, etc.. The topping selections are fresh and they seem to make a pretty \"clean\" sub. What I mean by \"clean\" is when I go to eat it, the toppings are not just falling out everywhere, making a mess. It's a good \"go to\" lunch selection when I need something quick. See you next week!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly new Subway in the Stallings area at the corner of Lawyers Rd & Stevens Mill. It's doing a few extra things not all Subways do. Along with now serving breakfast, it also features lots of coffees and lattes, muffins and other breakfast goodies. Pretty cool. It still serves up the traditional subs too. This store also has a nice outdoor sitting area as well. The service is friendly & all the food, in my experience, has been super fresh! I like it."}
{"text":"Quite the ordeal. This subway is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  You'd think they would thrive on having so much business.  Unfortunately it appears they don't want your business.  

I was in Phoenix for a convention last weekend.  There was a group at the convention that ordered over 100 boxed lunches for their group from here.  Some friends went into the location soon after that big order was finished and they were told the store \"ran out of bread\" and they should go down the street to another subway to get sandwiches.  WTH?  Really?  They were making bread and it would have taken about 20 more minutes to finish baking.  Turning away customers because you're out of bread...?  

I had a colleague who worked with another fast food chain.  If that situation ever arose for them, they were on the phone well ahead of time to other local stores to see if they could buy bread to get them through the rush.  Wouldn't that have been a smart idea?  Or how about getting the bread into the oven sooner so you didn't run out in the first place?!?!

Anyway, the next day I needed to get something for my kids that was quick and reasonable that they hadn't had the previous two days.  I decided to give this subway a try since it was after their lunch rush but well before any possible dinner rush.  I called ahead knowing I would need to walk down the block hoping for a quick stop and back up to the convention.  When I called, the person sounded rushed and put me on hold.  I started walking out of the hotel and down the street.  When they came back to the phone, I asked about placing an order to be picked up.  The person replied that they had a long line and asked that I call back in 10 minutes.

No problem.  I understand how busy this place was since I had seen the mass o' boxed lunches this other group had gotten.  I walked down the street in less than a minute.  When I walked into the restaurant, there were three customers completing their transaction at the register, but NO LINE whatsoever!  So, how is it that I was told there was a long line of customers and I should call back in 10 minutes?  I asked the clerk behind the counter the same question.  He said there were a bunch of people in there minutes ago.  I asked just two minutes ago?  I had called and there were so many people, I was asked to call back!  He replied by saying, \"if you don't believe me, that's on you\".  

Whatever...  So I placed my order and was out of there in a few minutes.  As I paid and was awaiting my change, the clerk said, \"here is your receipt\", and turned and walked away.  Normally I would expect something like, \"Thanks for coming\" or \"Come back again\".  Something, but I got nothing!  Such a poorly managed place!

Keep on Yelp'n!"}
{"text":"I had to get myself some new tires so as I waited I decided to get something to eat.  With lack of options I had no choice but to come to subway. The staff is extremely friendly which is why I gave 3 stars.  Other then the place is just really gross.  It needs a serious scrub down.  The tables were dirty with food as were the chairs and floors.  The glass guard was really gross it looked like someone just went and smeared grease all over it.  And where the containers where the food was looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks.  I would of gone some where else but at 9 am like I said lack of options."}
{"text":"We went on at 830PM and they wouldn't prepare flatitzzas for us because they'd have to heat some up in the oven and one of the kids quote, \"had already turned the oven off because we're closing at 9PM.\" On another occasion near the same time, one of the boys told incoming customers that, \"we're out of a lot of things,\" as if to scare them off. If you're open until 9PM, don't make customers feel like they're intruding between 8 and 9."}
{"text":"Omg. Online pre-order is completely meaningless here! We showed up 10mins after the order was supposed to be ready and they hadn't even started it! Then they helped 3 walk-ins ahead of us so husband got in line to make sure they wouldn't keep helping other people, and the guy working on our pre-order stopped to ask my husband if he could start a sandwich for him... well, you could start by finishing the 3 sandwiches that should have been ready 10minutes ago and stop helping everyone that walks in and leaving our sandwiches just sitting there. If we weren't staying at the hotel across the street there's no way we would have given this place a second chance after my first 2star experience, but we thought maybe if we pre-ordered online we'd have a 50% better experience and the complete opposite happened. To top it off, didn't get my extra cheese we paid extra for UGH! I try to find the good in things though so, the cookies were DELICIOUS yay."}
{"text":"Went in to try the breakfast english muffin, since I had a coupon for a free one, along with a coffee. Huge disappointment. First, she microwaved the egg, then she microwaved the english muffin. Then she put the cheese and \"1\" slice of ham on and nuked it again. Needless to say, the sandwich was hard and dry. Toppings were at a minimal. I've never had to ask for extra at a Subway before as the other locations I've been too are much more generous. The end result was a super flat, dry and sad looking english muffin. I would not recommend getting breakfast at Subway, or at least this location."}
{"text":"Went in 15 minutes before closing time.  All the lights were on and the sign that said \"open\" was still on.  Was told by a snotty employee that they were closed.  I asked why the lights and sign were still lit.  She turned them off when I said that.  I asked her what her manager would think if she knew they were closing early.  She said she wouldn't care. 

I walked out and now said my peace about this place."}
{"text":"Always fresh looking foods.. i love the place. I hope it stays the same and be more generous with meat 4 slices of meat is not enough for a footlong."}
{"text":"Bought sandwiches here and ask for extra pickles they give me 5 pieces of pickles extra."}
{"text":"To the owner of Subway who happens to own the Market Plaza parking lot. You got a racket going on in that parking lot. As tourists we had no idea we could not park at the Market Plaza to eat at the Market Cafe. Came out 30 minutes later to find our rental car being towed! $194 later we have our rental car. Went back to the parking lot to watch what was going on. There's a guy in a mini van sitting in there watching people step out of the parking lot & calling K & M towing. We witnessed 3 cars get towed in a matter of 15 minutes. Merry Christmas! You are running some sort of scam in there."}
{"text":"This Subway was actually pretty clean and well-stocked in soda and chips.  My footlong was, unlike on the Strip, actually $5.   It had fresh ingredients and a polite staff, so that's points for any Subway!"}
{"text":"Great service here. Employees actual provide genuine customer service while being efficient. Good tasting subs for Subway and decent location."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast employees. Store was clean and sub tasted fresh. The foot long meal comes with a drink and cookie. There's a raspberry cheesecake cookie that's pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean store and they always have cookies ready. The sandwiches taste like subway should and that's a good thing. The location is great, too."}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean store and good options menu wise. Vast variety of chips and drinks, too. Best sub is a toasted meatball marinara sauce with provolone."}
{"text":"Usually go to this subway for lunch. 

The location is clean and the staff is decent. Sometimes a little slow, but nothing too bad. Around the area there are other shops so if you need to hit multiple locations (coffee, convenience, dollar stores, etc) you can easily walk there in the non-winter months."}
{"text":"I was at their neighbor location (19th ave and northern) and asked for a single party platter. I sat and waited for 45 minutes and they have not yet started it. I decided to call this location, 19th ave and Glendale, and asked when they could have one made. Before I arrived to the location the platter was finished and packed up with cookies within 10 minutes.  Customer service was the best that I've experienced. 100% would return to eat here again. Extremely satisfied with their prompt service."}
{"text":"If I could give this establishment 0 stars I would. Everyone at this location is over their jobs and never heard of customer service. I walked in to a line literally out the door. I had to be at a presentation at the resort it was connected to but they decided to make 1 person run the whole fort down. I waited in line for 20 minutes. The other two employees either hid in that back or sat down and looked miserable. The lady in charge and also prepped the sandwiches had a major attitude problem and made me repeat things since her sour face was too over understanding my order. I asked for peppers and she said she didn't have any when clearly was in front of our faces. She also double charged us. Worst establishment ever! Get rid of cranky employees who don't enjoy being at a job. Tip- don't take it out on the customers, we are innocent people!!! Uncalled for."}
{"text":"I have been avoiding this location, because the service has been awful, and there is one right around the corner, so why be irritated? But the person driving stopped at this location the other night. The kid behind the counter was so patient and sweet to the little girl in front of us. Her mom ordered and then asked what she wanted. You could tell she had no clue, and took awhile to order. The guy behind the counter kept saying, \"thanks for your patience folks, I'll be right with you.\" By the time it was our turn, he still had his friendly personality working with us. I tried the new Chicken Caesar Sandwich, and was very happy. Glad I gave this location another chance. Hopefully the rude staff members are no longer working there."}
{"text":"This place always has friendly staff. Just every time I come in here, they are out of something?? Not sure who does the ordering but they need to step up their game!! Today they are out of shredded cheese and fountain drinks, Hi C Orange Lavaburst and Fanta Strawberry. Last time they were out of napkins. Really?? No napkins in a restaurant. The time before that they were out of straws."}
{"text":"The worst experience I've ever had is with this location. I ordered sandwiches online the website asks for your telephone number in case there is an issue with your order. I arrive at this location to find out the bread I wanted wasn't available so I changed the bread then they come back with we don't have the meatballs either. I asked for the order to be cancelled since it's now been charged to my card. Not only can they not find the order on their system I'm told I have to come back tomorrow to get my charge back. This place is the worst franchise out there I will never eat here again, I urge everyone to do the same. I feel they basically stole my money with a \" sorry nothing we can do about it\" attitude. To make it worse they took the meat and cheese off the bread put it back in the bins and return the bread to the warmer. Hope you vegetarians don't mind a little salami grease on your bread."}
{"text":"If I could give half a star I would. I use to work at this Subway location but put in my 2 weeks notice and don't regret doing so. I am not a disgruntled employee, but I want to make aware to the public that the produce is not as fresh as you think it's usually 3-7 days old. They change the expiration date early in the morning to pro- long the product and to save a quick buck. The cookies are hard as a brick and the bread is as hard as a rubber boot and if it's soft it's undercooked. I once found a rotten piece of chicken that was in a batch and brought it to my managers attention and it completely went over her head, there was also a coworker (Virginia Flores) that would make herself a salad during her lunch, then when she was done she would wash it with water and put it back on the rest of the clean plates that's getting served. Other than food the manager (Araceli Mendoza) was very unprofessional, she had that \"if they don't know don't tell attitude,\" she couldn't train if her life depended on it and on top of that she said if we worked more than 8 hours we get a break!! One good thing I can about this location is the lobby and bathrooms stay clean 24/7, but I would definitely reconsider another location."}
{"text":"I don't normally go out for lunch during the work week, but I went out for Subway one day during Christmas week. I have to say the people working there got me through the line very quickly. I love when Subway employees actually have a sense of urgency... doesn't happen very often. I got a 6 inch turkey & ham on Italian herb & cheese, with Swiss cheese, mustard, and pickles. A bag of Doritos and iced tea and I was on my way! There was a lot of meat on my sub! That's not a sandwich I typically order there so I don't know if it's always like that or if they gave me extra, but I couldn't even finish it! Crazy."}
{"text":"Came to this Subway for the first time the other day. I asked for a 6\" Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki on Italian bread. I figured the guy was new because he looked up at the menu confused like \"Sweet Onion...?\" Then he grabbed a loaf of Italian Herb & Cheese and I had to tell him regular Italian. Then he grabbed what appeared to be a wheat loaf and started slicing that... I asked if he was sure that was Italian cuz it looked like wheat. Another employee then had to point out which shelf the Italian bread was on. Then the guy asked if the 6\" only gets 1 tray of chicken. He also had a little trouble upon removing the sandwiches from the toaster oven and I think he burned his finger.
My sandwich tasted fine with the Swiss, sweet onion sauce, and pickles (both which I had to direct how much was enough). My chocolate chip cookie was fresh out of the oven. Yum!
I'm really hoping it was this guy's first day because that was not a typical Subway experience..."}
{"text":"I never look forward to parking at this Subway because it's right by the Harkins movie theater and it's often busy. But since it's a weeknight there were plenty of spots open. There was only one customer in there and she was leaving so we didn't have to wait. I asked for a 6 inch Subway Melt on flatbread. When he asked me what kind of cheese I looked down and saw roast beef instead of bacon. I told him I wanted the Melt not the Club. He fixed it promptly. The guy also didn't overdo the mustard and pickles as they often do. Took my sandwich, M&M cookie, and iced tea to go. When I got home the sandwich was still warm and the flatbread was soft. Good cookie too!"}
{"text":"My other half brought home subs for dinner. We wanted to try Subway's new roasted turkey, so I got it on 6\" Italian bread with provolone, bacon, mustard, and pickles. Man did they overdo the pickles! I pulled more than half of them off. The turkey really did taste like Thanksgiving leftovers. It's definitely a lot more filling than regular cold cuts. Could've used some salt & pepper."}
{"text":"Wanted something quick & easy after a long day of travel and went to Subway. Got a 6\" Meatball Marinara on Italian Herb & Cheese with Provolone, toasted, with parmesan & oregano. We sat at the only table that wasn't dirty. The sandwich was satisfying."}
{"text":"Ordered a 6\" meatball on Italian bread, toasted, with provolone cheese, parmesan & oregano. The first guy behind the counter didn't look happy to be there, but I moved down the line quickly. Got a couple chocolate chip cookies and iced tea. Used my $10 gift card and still had some left over for next time. Woohoo! My subbie was hot & tasty and I wolfed it down. Good Subway experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite while out running errands. We were confused because the guy inside was already putting chairs up on the tables and it was only 7ish (they close at 10). There were only two people ahead of us and it was taking forever! I was literally a second from walking out when Eric finally decided to help us. I got the 6\" sweet onion chicken teriyaki on Italian bread with Swiss cheese. I didn't feel like toasted bread, so he just heated up the chicken for me. These guys were so slow making sandwiches... After paying and getting our drinks, we sat down at one of the high top tables, since all the other chairs were up. Right when we started to eat, the two employees went outside to smoke, leaving the store completely unattended. We were amazed. The chicken in my sub was not the best quality and I had to spit out some inedible pieces. Also there was a static-y speaker playing Jingle Bell Rock cutting in and out. Very annoying. We were finished eating by the time the two employees came back in from their smoke break. So irresponsible. Then they proceeded to empty all three tea dispensers like they were getting ready to close up shop. It was only 7:30! I bet they were planning to close the store early. These guys ought to be fired."}
{"text":"Got a subbie for lunch on New Year's Eve. The guy working was in the back when I first walked up and then I had to ask him to repeat himself multiple times because he kept mumbling. He told me he was really tired. As for the sandwich, I got a 6\" rotisserie chicken on white, toasted with provolone, mustard, pickles, and salt & pepper. A simple sandwich with an iced tea was all I needed."}
{"text":"Just terrible! My friend & I both ordered sweet onion chicken teriyaki sandwiches and the chicken was junky. Couldn't even bite through several pieces and the rest just didn't taste good. If we were eating there, I would have asked for another sandwich, but we brought the subs home so I couldn't. I need to email Subway because it was really bad."}
{"text":"Ate at this Subway for the first time. Ordered a 6\" meatball on Italian Herb & Cheese with provolone, parmesan, and oregano. Got the combo with two cookies (oatmeal raisin & chocolate chip) instead of chips, which by the way were slim pickins. I don't think I'd ever seen the chip racks/baskets so empty before. Some of the cookies also looked very thin like they were falling apart. I don't think any other customers came in the whole time we were eating. It was the most deserted Subway and the two people working disappeared in the back too. But my sandwich was good and I enjoyed the chocolate chip cookie, although the oatmeal raisin tasted like peanut butter, so I'm guessing it was touching a peanut butter cookie at some point? Oh well. This meal was OK."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch break and got a 6\" meatball on italian, toasted w/ provolone, parmesan, and oregano. It got really busy after I ordered and there was a line the whole time I was there. Decided to place an online order for cookies and was curious to see if they would be ready on time. I went up to the counter at the pickup time and of course they hadn't gotten to it because of how busy they were, but they broke away from another customer to get my dozen cookies (6 chocolate chip and 6 oatmeal raisin). The cookies were big and delicious! I think my associates appreciated the treat."}
{"text":"Went to Subway for a quick lunch. There was one person in front of me but she was ordering multiple sandwiches so it was taking a long time. And there was only one guy working the counter. Finally someone else came out to help me after some more customers had lined up. I ordered a 6\" turkey & ham on flatbread. White or wheat? White. Wheat? White! She had to go in the back to get it and then said she would warm it up... Had it toasted with some American cheese, mustard, pickles, salt & pepper. An oatmeal raisin and an M&M cookie with a Sprite and I was on my way. My sandwich was very disappointing. The flatbread was soft but almost had a stale aftertaste. And I'm again reminded that their cold cuts are of low quality. If there were a Firehouse Subs, Jimmy John's, or Jersey Mike's closer I'd never have a reason to go to Subway... it's just not good."}
{"text":"It has been quite some time since I have written a one star review, but I was so inclined on this particular occasion that I ended up using Google street view to find and add this business to Yelp. 

I'll keep it short and sweet, as almost everyone knows what Subway is about. We arrived at this location quite starved but were really put off by the state of affairs. First of all, our first 3 choices of subs were simply not available. Once we settled for cold cuts, we were told that we didn't really have much choice as far as the bread or toppings either. I always find it a funny business model to run a restaurant with half the menu items missing. What really got ticked off was how we saw a chicken breast sandwich made without the chicken being warmed up. It's true that the meat is cooked, but there's no way that's safe. There were other unorthodox tidbits but I think this will suffice. 

Overall, walk a little further north to the 24hr McD right up the street. It will seem like fine cuisine in comparison."}
{"text":"As a recent convert to vegetarianism, I find myself at Subway often for the veggie patty sub or the $5 footlong Veggie Delite.

Subsequently, I've been in a lot of Subways around Charlotte.

This is the best overall. 

I've received consistently fast, friendly, polite and competent service, and I've never had stale bread here.

If you go around closing time, they sometimes offer free cookies."}
{"text":"Hold the attitude, please. 

This subway is close to work, and sits next to a Harris Teeter, so it's convenient to pick up a sandwich and a few items at the grocer,  but I've stopped going because of the staff.

The food is fine, the location is safe and it's always clean, but the staff seems to have a problem with attitude.

Some examples:

1. I don't know about you, but I don't memorize Subway hours. I walked up right about closing time, and  they hadn't turned off the \"Open\" sign yet, so I tried the door. Locked. No biggie to me, but the guy inside has a hissy fit and starts blinking the \"Open\" sign off and on while I'm standing there and mouthing the words \"we're closed.\" This might not sound too bad, but you could tell by the expression that this was a HUGE problem for this guy. 

2. Same guy. I'm digging out coins from my pocket and hand some over to the guy. Apparently, one of my quarters is Canadian (about the same size). He takes the Canadian coin and shoves it back into my hand without saying a word and pulls out another quarter from my hand. Gee, thanks for violating  my personal space in a most undignified way in order to exchange one coin for another that is practically identical in value. 

3. I've had other staffers there twice argue with me about how a sandwich should be toasted. It wasn't in a mean way, but it wasn't polite, either. Yo, sandwich artisans: Feel free to offer POLITE suggestions, that's part of your job, but don't argue with me about MY SANDWICH. I'm not asking you to take it to the top of BofA building to toast it,.I just want the bread toasted, the cheese melted and the veggie patty warm. I don't think that's too much to ask. 

4. Last time I went, there was an obvious trainee and a woman I believe to be one of the managers. The trainee was clueless about how to talk to customers; he seemed scared out of his mind, and there were a lot of blank stares while he was making my sandwich, as in \"what do I do next?\" 

The more experienced manager-type might have offered some clues but ... you have to love this ... she was too busy making her own sandwich to notice. I know they gotta eat, too, but she was aggressive and rude to her employee, pushing ahead of him while he was making my sandwich. No class whatsoever. 

I also watched her put some tomatoes on her sandwich, then take them off and put them back in the serving tray to get fresher, more ripe tomatoes. That's the spirit, keep the good ones for yourself, and let the customers get the crappy ones. 

I know these aren't exactly horror tales, but ... there's another Subway on Kings where I've eaten far more often and NEVER had an issue with customer service."}
{"text":"So, apparently, my \"scoop\" on Subway was not really groundbreaking..  Founded in 1965, they have a over thirty thousand locations all over the world..  So, um, check one out if there is one nearby.."}
{"text":"Chalk up another one for this place being awful. Poor service. I order the monthly special and get charged full price. Not friendly at all. I just live so damn close it's hard to resist. I guess I will just have to quit Subway for a while."}
{"text":"This Subway has some, er, interesting characters that patronize this location. This could probably be chalked up to the fact that the Subway here isn't in the best area. When Thai Pepper failed me and my husband, we ended up here for a quick meal. I instantly noticed that most tables were dirty. When paying for our meal, there was a bit of a language barrier. While trying to enjoy our lunch, we were bothered by drunken fools trying to make conservation with us. I hate talkative drunk people! I highly doubt I'll be returning to this location.

{"text":"I frequent this location the most often and for good reason! The Subway is conveniently located to my home, but the great customer service is what makes this my favorite store. I visited on Saturday evening around 7 PM and I was the only customer.  I was promptly greeted and the cashier was very friendly. He graciously let me change out my sub bread when I saw a flavor I wanted to try (jalapeño flavor! ) without a peep. He also answered all the questions I had with a smile.

I ordered a sub with a veggie patty, which I love because it's more substantial than the veggie delite. It's a great option for vegetarians,  although it is on the more expensive side (as all \"fake\" meat is). The cookies at Subway are always amazing- my favorites are the chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin.

The folks are professional and after a couple times of going there they remember my order.  They are efficient at getting through the line."}

I'm still grossed out.. I kept offering a positive attitude to (and thanking) Ms. How many times can I pierce my lip, and I just kept receiving a \"you're lucky I'm helping you\" vibe.. seems like another posted something similar.."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Some old lady who works there was extremely rude. I asked what was on 2 new sandwiches that they added and she replied with such a rude attitude.  Made my sandwich very sloppy.  And when I asked her to use a different knife to cut my sandwich she refused and said she had wiped that one down. The customer before me got tuna and I hate that and didn't want the taste on my sandwich.  I don't recommend going to this crappy subway because of the old rude lady. If the management knew how many customers she offends I hope she would be let go."}

Like isn't your job to smile n say have a nice day ! Not Messing with hungry customers or arguing over 1.43 just to be \"right\" ! Honey you are going to making sandwiches for a loooong time ! I wouldn't have even given this behavior one star but apparently you have to in order to get your review posted !"}

She has been here for over a year and has totally changed my view on subway.

My family and I will keep coming back because of the fresh tasting food and the awesome customer service ."}
{"text":"Subway is subway, is subway... once you've been to one you've been to them all in terms of food.  The service on the other hand is where things change.  In this area there are 3 subways and this on is the best in terms of service.  The staff are quick and friendly and don't seem to automated or robotic - reaching for lettuce and tomato before you even tell them what toppings you want.  3 stars because this is just your average subway."}
{"text":"This is a nice, small subway. Not a lot of people sit down to eat so it never feels too crowded. Always clean. I've been coming here for years and I have yet to have any real problems no matter what time of day I go in. If you like subway, stop by this one."}
{"text":"Suggestion 1: Don't come to this subway at night. 
Suggestion 2: Don't come to this subway.

We cane to this 24 hour subway at about midnight after seeing a movie and we wanted something quick to get that wasn't McDonald's. So we found this subway right down the street from the fiesta and decided to check it out. Pulling in we were welcomed by homeless people sleeping right out back on both sides next to the parking spaces. We just ignored it and went in.  We weren't planning on staying anyway. 

When we get in there was a guy cleaning the equipment and said he'd be right with us.  After he washed his hands, he turns to us,  irritated, and asks:

\"Do you guys have a dog with you?\"

We were confused. We clearly did not have a dog with us and he works behind a see-through counter so why would he need to ask us this? 

\"....Um.. no.\" We replied.

To which he responded

\"Oh, good, because this couple just came in here and I didn't realize they had a dog until I saw it f****** piss on the floor! Excuse my French.\"

\"Oh haha. *nervous laughter*\"

\"Yeah, so anyways,  what can I get ya?\"


There's nothing quite like having your meal prefaced with the fact that,  just moments ago, the person handling your food was cleaning up dog pee. Or the fact that a dog was peeing so close to the food you're about to eat.

I didn't get anything, but somehow my friend was still able to stomach it. I think maybe she was just trying to be polite and didn't wanna make me drive her somewhere else but I definitely would've after that. She took one for the team. Salute.

 My verdict: There are far too many subways out there for you to waste your time at this one."}
{"text":"Ya know I get that its subway, but if you don't wanna make sandwiches please dont work there! Theres maybe one employee who is always awesome at this location but I often have issues with other sandwhich makers.

In this case Zuri made my sandwich. First off nothing is more condescending than asking me \"anything else\" after not only my first ingredient but every single ingredient I ask for. I will tell you when Ive added the last ingredient. Inless i look confused about what i want dont ask me anything else. And when i tell u \"i have a few more things comin\" dont ask me \"anything else after the next ingredient. 

Secondly i cant stand when ingredients are thrown on my sandwich! It doesnt take a lot of energy to distribute the spinach evenly across the bread! As petty as it sounds, it almost takes more energy to make a crappy sandwich and show me you dont care than to just make me the kind of sandwhich you would make for yourself.

And lastly I get theres a line but address me when your done making my food! Say \"here ya go\" or atleast look in my direction me when your done with what im paying for! 

The manager here is really cool Im sure things will be better next time!"}
{"text":"Really a 2.5...

I was driving home one day after work thinking about what I was going to eat for dinner. I've been on a salad binge trying to lose the pre-holiday weight. Haha. So what do I see? A brand new Subway joint on my way home! Sweet! Usually I have to drive another 10 minutes out of my way but thats no biggie either.

So I roll in and apparently they've just opened a few days ago. So new that they dont even have credit card machines yet. So I step up and order my favorite roast beef sandwich. The prices are the same as other Subway's so that wasnt a big deal. The real kicker to me is how they make the sandwiches. What do I mean?

I want the sandwich maker person to make my sandwich like if they were trying to put the place out of business. There are several Subways around town with specific people that make sandwiches with extra meat on them without even asking... Because really... It's not coming out of their pocket. If you really think about it, they actually gain more because of the tips they would be getting. I have no problem tipping a person $2 for a $5 sandwich if they make it heavy on the meat.

So the nice lady just goes and lays around 6-8 slices of roast beef on my foot long and was a little skimpy on the veggies. Oh well... I guess I'll have to try another sandwich maker before I write this place off and go back to my regulars."}
{"text":"Not good, and we are huge Subway fans. The employee was super slow. He didn't know how to make the sandwiches from the menu, and he left off ingredients. The lettuce bin was almost empty and the lettuce was wilted and yellow."}
{"text":"So before I start my own review. I want to comment on the review below mine.
This person went to subway 2 times in 2 weeks, seemingly with the intent to be a nuisance.
Why ask a question you already know the answer to? Just to cause trouble, put others down, and make you feel better about yourself?
After reading the entire review, I didn't even find out if she ordered anything if if she did, how it tasted.
Which brings me back to my first point. Why go to a restaurant twice in 2 weeks if you don't like the food from there?

Now onto my review. To be fair, isn't going to be much more fantastic. But really, if you've been to a Subway before, you're getting the same kind of thing at every single Subway. I arrived maybe about 15 minutes before closing, and the gentleman who was running the shop was mopping the floors so I felt a bit bad walking in and making the floors dirty again. I would expect a disgruntled worker rushing the get the job done to get me out so he can get back to cleaning so he can go home sooner. But that is not how it went down. He served me respectfully and did not cheap out on toppings either. I ordered a Foot long roast beef sub combo (i'm a meatball sub guy but they didn't have any at the time and i wasn't going to complain), topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, lite-mayo, and chipotle sauce. drink and chips are kinda irrelevant here.
i chose not to toast my sub which i usually don't, but for the roast beef, that was a mistake. definitely get it toasted.
sub tasted fine otherwise, and realistically, i know it's fast food. i'm smart enough to know it's not health food. let's be real.
have to say, subway has a weird smell to it though, every subway smells like this, something needs to be done about it.

didn't think my review would ever be this long for a Subway, but since there's really nothing else for you all to refer to at the moment, you can refer to this."}
{"text":"Sort of done with this location.  They don't accept the Subway coupons that you sometimes get with the newspaper; they ONLY accept the ones from the Mt. Lebanon calendar that have their address on them.  
Went last weekend and the parking lot was covered in snow; untouched  by a snowplow.  They didn't have any meatballs ready (it was noon).  Employees don't seem to care.  It's also too cold to eat in there comfortably, and the bathrooms are gross and dirty.  Much better location down the road in Banksville Plaza."}
{"text":"I've visited this Subway twice recently and both experiences were perfect. The first time, I dined in and the second time was to go. Most footlong subs are $7.50, which is more expensive than other Subways, but this is downtown Cleveland. I was politely greeted on both visits around noon. 

I ordered a footlong Italian BMT toasted and it was delicious. The service was fast. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Since my wife works so close to home, she has been putting in more hours at the office.  Well, there are quite a few fast food restaurants between her office and home, so we've adopted this new dinner plan: get some cheap food on the way home.

Instead of her calling me to ask me what I wanted, I called her!  Yep, the Pavlovian Dog Experiment really works!  I was flipping channels on TV when I saw a Subway commercial for their new spicy hot subs.  I thought, \"I wonder if they're as hot as they say they are.\"  Within 30 minutes of viewing said commercial, I placed the call to wifey to ask her to stop at Subway on her way home.  Damn you, Subway!  

I wanted to try the new Buffalo Chicken sub, so that's exactly what I did.  Got it on wheat with lettuce, tomato and mayo.  It was really good, but I could barely taste any Buffalo sauce at all.  I have some Frank's Red Hot Sauce (the best ever!) and I instantaneously debated adding some, but I was so hungry I just ate the thing.

So it was a good sammich, but not hot at all.  Subway lies like Taco Bell when they claim to serve spicy hot food.  This 'spicy hot' is for wimps.

I'm out."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Subway during a recent volleyball tournament. I ordered a footlong Italian B.M.T.  on wheat bread. I added all the fixins and they loaded the sub up well.

Once I got back to the tournament, my daughter was playing, so she had to wait to eat. Once she opened the sub, she removed the awesome toppings I had them add, but that's okay, she still ate the whole thing. I loved the sandwich. They put plenty of peppers, tomatoes, and mayo on it, which made it taste awesome. It was filling and it hit the spot. Next time I'm in Sheffield at a volleyball tournament, you know where I'm eating!

I opted to use the drive thru and it ended up returning to the tournament before my friends who also went to Subway, but left before me!

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"The service here is great. It's also very clean and never really that busy. For a Subway it's about as good as it gets. Open 24 hours as well and even at 3 am the employees seem happy to be there!"}
{"text":"Always fresh quality food.Nice and clean atmosphere.
In heart of  Mint Hill downtown.Fast and Friendly
Customer service."}
{"text":"I know that its just a Subway, but I really, really like this one.  The owners of this franchise actually work here during the day- and they seem to really care about the quality of the food they serve.  

I work nearby- there are 3 other Subways within driving distance, but this is the only one that I go to.  Everything always tastes very fresh and the owners even remember me and say hi every time I walk in.  

It's a very good place to grab a sandwich."}
{"text":"And still I persist.  Why I don't know.  In years past I used to like Subway and ate there several times a week.  The only reason I go to this one is because where I live I have a choice between the raw cook it yourself pizza place (that I stopped going to) and Subway.  I simply don't have any other nearby fast food options when I've had a long day and want a fast bite to eat.

After my most recent visit I was prompted to write this review because I wondered why it looked like there was so little meat on my salad, which after all is just supposed to be a sandwich without bread, right?  Being naturally curious I had to find the answer to that question and I did, directly from a Subway franchise owner (not the one who owns this store however).

It seems their \"formula\" is that if you order a sandwich as a salad it is built to have a six inch portion of meat and cheese and a footlong's portion of veggies.

But the rub comes when you pay for it.  If you order that meal as a SMALL sandwich it will cost you $4.59 and if you order that same sandwich as a LARGE it will cost you $4.99.  Now if you follow their formula and get a large amount of veggies and a small amount of meat and cheese how much do you think it will cost you?  Wrong!  The salad version is $6.58!!!  That is some creative math they've got going on there.

That would be bad enough but, hey it's my choice to be stupid and not just buy a large loaded sandwich and throw the bread away.  My reason for giving them 0-stars however (and calling in the Dept of Weights and Measures) is look at the picture of my salad.  Do you think that's the same amount of meat that they put on a small sub sandwich?  I doubt it. 

But look again. See anything missing?  Yep, NO CHEESE!!

So now the question is should we call it creative math or something far more sinister like the fact that they got busted because their \"footlong\" sandwiches weren't actually 12\" long?  Stay tuned.  Maybe that location will be vacant soon and I'll have a whole new option for fast food near my house."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the worst excuse of a salad ever.   It was more like a quarter of a salad and was all wilted.  Just sad."}
{"text":"I go to this Subway all the time because it's right down the street from where I live. The food is a solid average, as can be expected at any Subway. Sometimes the bread and lettuce are not as fresh as one might like.

It's the service here that really irks me. Every time I go in the staff seemed to be overwhelmed even if it's just 1-3 people ordering food. They seem visibly upset when new customers walk in. I get it, you work at Subway, ergo you hate your job. Suck it up and smile at the hungry customers because we all hate our jobs! As well they are often ill prepared and have to get stuff from the back, or heat up meats in the microwave. 

Geographical convenience alone will keep me going here for breakfast subs on the weekends! 

Cheers,"}
{"text":"My friend got a tuna sandwich from here and after he ate it didn't feel so hot. Being wise and knowledgeable I knew better then to eat at this place. Sure glad I didnt have a sandwich. Fremont street sucks."}
{"text":"Very poorly ran store! I went in on my lunch break and stood in line over 40 mins because there was only one employee working at 12:30. In the 40 mins I stood in line I witnessed the employee make several rude remarks because she was becoming overwhelmed. Don't think I'll be returning to this poorly managed store."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a regular here.  So what?

Sure, we can debate all day the merits of places using artisanal bread, wax poetic about house-cured capicola and applaud the usage of a myriad of other \"authentic\" ingredients flown in from half-way around the world*, but honestly, at the end of the day (do take a knee and contemplate), isn't there a part of you deep within that yearns for the satisfaction that comes when you get that bang for your hard-earned buck? 

You know what I'm talking about .  Up high.  *smack transitions to fist pump* 

Operating on a pseudo bi-weekly timescale, my craving for things pressed between two buns hits me hard and fast.  It whispers sweet, sweet nothings in my ear causing any and all peripheral matters to fall away, leaving me naught but a singular focus: It's time to get myself a sammich - yea.

Pradeep is my go-to guy here (has the Sunday shift) and he never gyps on the fillings.  My main staples: 

 + 12 inch Spicy Italian on Honey Oat with Provolone cheese, toasted, loaded with all veggies (extra jalapeños and/or banana peppers), finishing with a splash of vinegar.   

 + 12 inch Light tuna (less mayo) on Honey Oat (same amt of fiber as the wheat, but tastes better - get it) with Pepper Jack cheese, toasted, all veggies again and definitely extra hot peppers too...and a drizzle of vinegar here as well, b/c why not?  

This branch has always been well-kempt whenever I've visited, and with the ever present aroma of freshly-baked bread in the air, how can you resist?  

Come.  Get that 12 (whoppin') inch sub for $5.xx and rest easy knowing you've got the meals for the rest of the day covered.

Choice of bread, the veggies, the meat, the sauces and so on, it's the classic Subway's operating system   Service is reasonably fast, and there are the same standardized pricing.  Still, it worked for Jared to loose weight and eat healthy (so long as I cut down on the mayo stuff), and the food is acceptable for a snack or the quick lunch, so why not?

Just apologize and try to be pleasant and sell what you have on hand. No, the kid could have cared less, which is a reflection of management in general. Then the straw that broke the camels back, he threw a piece of chicken that been out for God's know how long, he threw back in the bin.

{"text":"Review is for the Asian employee, with the lip ring and blond streak in his hair. He works graves.

Okay, so my boyfriend + I live across the street.... we normally go linedancing on Thursday nights right there in the same complex. I was hungry one night {last week} and my boyfriend suggested 'Subway'. Last week we had ordered the \"Flatizza\".... one was only cheese, the other pepperoni. He wasn't thrilled when we ordered that last week, we inquired about the difference between the personal pizza and the flatizza. Seemed like he didn't want to make either, he was bothered that we would order such a thing.... but I'm sorry, when you're vegetarian your options are limited and a pizza sounded great! Anyway, it was good and I was excited to have the flatizza at Subway again!

So again this week, after linedancing we wanted to have flatizzas again. Once we arrived, we definitely weren't greeted, he just put his gloves on and looked at us making hand gestures like \"what do you want?\". I ordered a flatizza, he groaned under his breath and then, dare I ask him if they have peppers.... he gave me attitude and was like \"peppers? What kind of peppers?\" And I felt bad for even asking that so I just said \"it's okay, just cheese please\".... he proceeded, with attitude, \"all that we have is right there\" pointing at their line of ingredients. My boyfriend + I heard a sigh of \"GOD\" under his breath after that as well.... that is when my boyfriend just grabbed me and we left because he was just not nice, easily angered, and rude to his customers. I don't go to Subway for top notch service, I understand where I'm at.... I just wanted some fooooooddd, I was looking forward to that pizza!!! 

It's too bad this particular employee is such a grouch and always seems to be in a crabby mood. It really shows and makes it awfully uncomfortable for the customer. We won't be back, it was just too convenient being right by our house and our Thursday night cardio spot =["}

Today, this skinny little kid with tattoos all over his fore arms was either high as a kite or dumb as a box of rocks.  He obviously was not bright.  I will go with high.

Said the manager is new (only on the job 2 months and still trying to figure things out).  Went to the \"SUBWAY\" website to file a complaint and get to the end and it asks to type the words to verify it's from a real person.....and there are NONE....so you can't even contact the head office to let them know how poorly this location is being run.  Guess when you go for lunch at this location you need to be flexible in what you want for lunch.....or better yet GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!"}

She was honest about which vegetables were the most fresh, too, which is not something you usually find in a chain fast food restaurant.  Anyway, I was super hungry, and was so glad this place was open late!  Will stop here again if I'm near here and have that Subway craving..."}
{"text":"It is a Subway, so the standard fare is available and is generally good. However the little things are what detract from this store's rating. I eat here a lot and often times struggle with parking. It would help if the employees would park remotely instead of right in front of the store. In addition, it's often times difficult to find a clean table. There seems to be debris on the tables and floor most of the time and I have NEVER seen an employee make the effort to wipe tables and/or sweep the floor when there's a need. They must wait until the end of the day. Any way, it's the little things like these that make the difference, especially when there's so much competition around."}
{"text":"It is subway, yes. But this particular subway deserves a review. Our office is within walking distance so I make it here once or twice a week. 5 dollar sandwiches, holler at your acquaintance. The staff here is very friendly and they don't forget what kind of cheese you want 5 seconds after you tell them. Greetings goodbyes and smiles every time. Best subway if not fast food restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This specific Subway was very dirty the tables needed to be wiped and the floors needed to be swept.  A herd of children came in while we were eating and they were all given free cups and all stood in front of the soda dispenser blocking paying customers. 

The sandwich makers seemed to be more interested in something going on in the back of the store and all the kids that were coming in than they were of paying customers.  I would not visit this store again."}
{"text":"Great management, employees & the food is always fresh and delicious. Mario, the manager, and the employees welcome everyone with a big smile and hello as they come through the door. They keep the tables, seats and floors clean (even the chips perfectly in line and replenished) which is impressive because this is a very popular, busy location. (I even take notice of the window sills, windows, restrooms & other details that food inspectors check, since Dining Grades has asked me to review for them), and yes, this Subway gets an A+ from me. After reading that this is a busy location, you might be thinking that there's always a line & wait, but it's really cool, because there never is. I eat there all of the time (reading the health magazine of which they always have a clean stack), and I see the customers coming in every couple of minutes. Yet they just flow right in and out. What I love about these employees is that they have great attitudes even with the picky requests. (Here's one of my usual ordeals that I'll put them through, haha: \"White flatbread, toast the bacon on its own first twice, to make it extra crispy, then toast the flatbread, bacon, turkey and cheese just until it's soft, American cheese, no, no change that to Provolone, avocado, but on that other side, could you spread it MORE evenly all of the way to every edge, now mayo on the other side, the tomatoes on top of the mayo, then cucumbers and then lettuce evenly on the avocado.\" I swear, they always do it perfectly, and it's fantastic. (You have got to try this sandwich like this.) The photo today is just a ham and cheese, but ya gotta love how they always have the cucumbers and tomatoes perfectly layered in line. My favorite employees are Blair and Nick; those guys are super outgoing with fantastic personalities, and I love how Subway has refreshed their colors, branding and uniforms this year. The polo shirts look sharp and clean. ...Can't forget the cookies. My favorites: white chocolate macadamia nut and of course chocolate chip. 'Always soft."}

{"text":"So I am guessing every employee at this location makes their sandwiches slightly different.. my 2nd day this week getting a tuna 6inch, 1st one was great!! Had lots of tuna that I could actually enjoy & taste, today not so much,
They give u smallest ice cream scoops ever & when asked for more, the girl rudely said it's extra? Like really, you barely put any to begin with, but ok that's fine 
She wasn't friendly much anyways but from now on I won't be going back. My sandwich is very sad looking"}
{"text":"Typical subway restaurant. The main reason why I give it a two over anything higher is due to the fact that every since time I've gotten a sandwich here, (when put together by specifically one of the workers) it's always not completely folded correctly. This is done in a way that every time unwrap the sandwich half the ingredients are outside the bread and paper wrapped soaked with the majority of the sauces used. It's just disappointing that everything is done so well, but the final step of putting it all together ruins the whole experience."}
{"text":"They use less food when making sandwiches than other locations. Example: I got a foot long breakfast sandwich and the rep only put two pieces of eggs - other locations I've been too place a total of four on a foot long. 

They also weren't very sanitary. They placed my breakfast meat directly on their counter (when they use a white paper for everything else) when my sub was in the oven. I had to ask for they guy not to use those slices."}
{"text":"I feel like the woman didn't understand anything I was saying. Besides the communication issue, we were overcharged for a footlong when we ordered a 6 inch. When refunding, they tried to exclude the tax. The woman also didn't know what to about the text offers from Subway for a free cookie. Sandwich was fine. Restaurant and restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Well, it's a Subway. What can you say? Usually come here around lunch time and my sandwich is always made quickly and is very tasty. I'm surprised it's not busier on weekday afternoons. Don't know how you can mess up a sandwich so it's always reliably good for lunch."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewer. While the staff are friendly and helpful, the owner is the exact opposite. Also, this is the first Subway I've seen that doesn't offer wraps, to replace the bread."}
{"text":"I have to admit, Subway does fulfill my sandwich craving on rare occasions. I like that they toast the bread, unlike some of the other big sandwich shops. The cookies are pretty good. And the $6 combo is a good option for a cheap lunch. 

But I have to subtract a star for how miserable everyone who works here seems. Do any of these people smile?

My cheap Subway lunches are reliably good and the service, while not the friendliest, is quick. I can be in and out of this place in a matter of minutes, even around the weekday lunch rush."}
{"text":"The two men who were working here today were awesome! They were very friendly and our service was prompt! While we were enjoying our meal a very difficult customer came in and was making ludicrous demands and the employees were very patient with her. Even though she was under the influence they put up with her rudeness and lack of respect and patience! WE WILL BE COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"All of the workers at this subway are really friendly! No problems ever, quick drive thru when I need it :)"}
{"text":"If I can put zero stars I would. My mother and i come here all the time never had a problem until today. We came today and brought my sis and my daughter with us today let me start off at this female working there name Salma just felt her vibe she wasn't to happy to be working. We ordered our food another lady there took our order. Everything was good until we had gave my baby sis money to give to a homeless man outside subway she came in and wanted to wash her hands but Salma was in there so she waited a good minute so Salma finally came out my sis and my daughter that's only 2yrs old they went to the bathroom my daughter screams a lot she's in her terrible two's... so Salma that was taking a customer order yelled across the room to tell my mom her kid's are playing in the bathroom my mom stood up and said they are not she's washing her hand's Salma said WELL THATS'S WHAT I AM HEARING after my mom walked away to get the kids. I'm starring right at her the man was going to pay for his food he wanted her to do the money a certain way she looked at him and said ill do it this way he looked at her and shook his head. Me and my mom was talking about it she paused and looked at us that's when I went up to her while she was about to take another customer order I simple asked her excuse me can I have your corporate office number and your name she paused gave me a rude look raised up her eyebrow and replied when \"IM DONE\" in a rude way so I told her I'll wait right here so I did. The lady paid and she looked back at me and said what can she help me wit so I replied your corporate office number and your name she said they don't have one but she can give me her name I said isn't it on your recipe because I work in a fast food myself I know! she said no so I asked for her boss number she walked in the back to get a card came back and said they ran out that she can give me the number on the recipe I asked will she be in tomorrow she paused again wit her attitude and said Monday at 7am not tomorrow and walked away that's when I got fired up and said have a wonderful f***** day she replied God bless you and laughed... I don't understand people that's your job honey if you don't like it don't work for it. I know talking to the manager won't solve anything but they do need to know."}
{"text":"Subway is decent. But better sub shops are out there. 5 dollar foot longs are a deal when your hungry. Friendly staff and nice clean layout. They dont mind requests as in Extra Sauce and whatnot. Though the microwave was down which was a bummer because i like it to be microwaved and not toasted but oh well. I shall be back."}
{"text":"As fast food chains go, it's OK and as another post indicated the bathrooms need closer attention."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches,  great customer service.. location is within walking distance from me. Great experience."}
{"text":"This is my fav subway to go to everything is very clean the food taste great ive been here 30+ times and its consistently good , nice people too

I made the mistake if going to the one inside walmart once and they put my sub in the oven and when it cane out i assumed it was toasted , when i got home it wasn't, they forgot to turn the oven on -_- also didnt taste good.

TRUST ME GO TO THIS SUBWAY!"}
{"text":"The manager sucks. She sits at the register and watches as the one other employee takes care of every customer. Apparently as a Subway manager she's too good to help make the food. Two people in front of me I set there for like 20 minutes"}
{"text":"This location has the slowest staff ever. The place always smells like pot, and the employees seem high. Also, they refuse to order even some of the most basic ingredients, like Spicy Mustard. If you ask for them, they'll tell you not to ask again because they're not ordering them. Won't be back no matter how close to home."}
{"text":"Ryan was a true artist with our sandwiches. Fresh veggies and positive vibes. We'll be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"OMG was this Subway hard to find or what?! It's located at Mandalay Bay near the convention. Just ask a hotel employee since it's easy to get lost. 

I was staying at the Four Seasons Hotel a few weeks ago and I ventured out for a quick pre-dinner snack for my sister and me. It seriously took me about 45 minutes to just go downstairs and find Subway LOL. All the signs in the casino was confusing AF.

I eventually got my 6 inch spicy Italian. It was good and the girl working there was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"This post is particularly for the management and/or owner. Your Subway is the closest to my house and your staff is FANTASTIC!  The staff is friendly and super sweet to my kids when we come in PLUS pretty good sandwich makin.'  I also like that your place is always clean. 
My only complaint and major concern is the LIGHTING in your parking lot at night is absolutely horrendous!  It's so dark and creepy that I feel very unsafe & nervous when I step out onto the parking lot from my car and when I leave your restaurant. You need to contact property management or whoever to change and improve your light fixtures outside your building. I believe the light fixtures have a tile of some kind in front of it. The tile should be removed and be replaced with a cover that is transparent or emits more light. I have debated several times if I should drive to another Subway a mile or two farther just because I do not feel safe in your parking lot at night.
Please take this seriously and change the lighting in front of your building.  Thank you so much and we hope to come back and see a brighter & safer place at night."}
{"text":"Would leave no stars if I could. The teenagers that work here are super rude. The 3 of them actually stood there and fought over who was going to make my daughters sandwich. Don't ever go here, the one on N. Durango is much better and they're actually polite."}
{"text":"The counter guy was very rude and made people giving orders feel uncomfortable!!! I have been in many times and he is the same to everyone!! I will go somewhere else from now on if I see him .. there was a disabled gentleman that came in and tried to hand him his order that was wrote down he was shaking and accidentally dropped it the rude asshole behind the counter practically yelled at him and told him he can't touch his paper it's unsanitary!!! The young man apologized multiple times with no reply like it's ok or anything!! I stepped up to help this poor kid and I felt horrible . Every person he waited on felt uncomfortable!! No customer service or smiles or anything!! He blamed the poor kid because he had to change his gloves !! He was even rude to his poor co worker"}
{"text":"9 Grain Wheat or Honey Rolled Oats are breads after my heart. Instead of the humdrum white flour variety, wheat breads have a natural sweetness to them that elevates a sandwich. Right now they are running the FrebruANY promotion. Any foot long is only five dollars. It makes no difference to me because my normal Veggie Delite is the same price year long. 

I might not be a vegetarian, but I feel no sense of loss when ordering. The fresh selections of vegetables more than make up for the fact that I am not taking advantage of their deal. I have a sandwich stacked high with lettuce, spinach, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, olives, pepperoncinis, and a generous amount of red wine vinegar. Adding avocado helps to balance the tartness of the vinegar with some healthy fats. With all their sandwiches, the option to get cheese is also readily available. 

With all this talk about Subway being a healthy option for dining, maybe I should not jump in my car and just walk across the street. Oh well, one step at a time."}
{"text":"Subways are the new McDonald's or Starbucks. There is a plethora of them springing up on every corner and no need to travel more than a block to get to any of them. Located next to the Starbucks on the corner of LV and Blue Diamond, it was close to where I picked up a friend. 

I did not want bar food, so after she got her order, I picked up a Veggie Delite on 9 grain honey out. The food is similar to the others across the board. Maybe the veggies are not as fresh, but they have a wide selection. I like the one near Bachi Burger more because the place is better lit, the produce is more vibrant, they pack my sandwiches with all the toppings, and the employees are more astute to their customers request."}
{"text":"Standards of cleanliness, freshness of produce, and friendliness of staff can drastically change a customers perception of a chain restaurant or fast food joint. Subway tends to be a place I frequent when I want something filling, low in calories, and quick. 

My go to is a veggie delite with all the vegetables, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, and oregano on 9 grain honey wheat. Maybe I have trained my taste buds to light nothing else. A part of me is not complaining because my sandwich is packed with fresh ingredients and contains so many kicking flavors. I will not be complaining because a footlong will only set me back $5. SWEET!"}
{"text":"i love me some Tuna salad here. came on a friday during Lent so it's pretty much the only place that served anything remotely good for a God fearing Christian like myself. can't beat the $5 footlong anywhere. plus, i can get back to Oshea's beer ponging quick. 

observing Lent in Sin City is pretty much the definition of irony."}
{"text":"So I've been to this location numerous times but tonight was an exception. Their cc machine wasn't working which is also what they swipe their gift cards though. After two attempts the one employee told me I was good to go and the food was on them. I asked if they were sure and the second employee said well u can pay or I'll just pay out of my pocket. He literally took every penny I had. I felt bad not paying for my dinner which is why I offered but it was like a really bad date where the guy let me pay and for the sake of good customer service, he shouldn't of take a penny from me because now I'm more than likely not coming back. 
Ps. The girl working (the first employee) was very sweet and kudos to her for knowing what good customer service is."}
{"text":"Meh...it's Subway! I like it better than Port a Subs or Jersey Mikes. I usually only get Subway when we're in the middle of no where and it's either this or McDonalds or we are getting on a plane and we have no time or better options. But there is one located a block from work, I was in need of lunch and was also being lazy at the time.
The service was quick for lunch time and the staff was friendly and efficient. The shop was clean.
 And 5$ for a foot long is pretty damn cheap."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here since I read all the horrible reviews, but I was hungry so decided to give it a shot. Walked in around 7:30pm and there were 2 gentlemen working. Both very friendly and not a single hesitation with my order.  We took both sandwiches home and even decided to share a picture on here so you can see the awesome job they did! I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I've just received the 1-star experience here. that has been reported by the other reviewers. 0 stars.

It's close to 9 p.m. on May 18, 2017 and the \"veteran\" employee, whose name I've learned is Karen, is extremely rude and inattentive. While the new employee struggled to complete my order, she repeatedly asked for assistance with it as well as the other customers both ahead and after me. Due to Karen's blatant lack of energy, help, attention and professionalism, the customers in line behind me were actually checked out before me, leaving me \"next\" in line for a total of over 20 minutes.
In my time there, Karen yelled at her co-worker repeatedly, ignored her requests for help, and STILL managed to screw up my order. In addition to this review, I intend to file a complaint with management and contacting their headquarters. As the other reviewers have stated, I will be intentionally avoiding this Subway location in the future."}
{"text":"Food was good. Girl working behind the counter sucked tonight. 1/13/16. One of the other female employees came out with her phone while the girl was preparing my sandwich. She was complaining that this was her third day in a row that she was on-call. The other girl complained that so-and-so can get a day off but she never can when she wants. The girl with the phone said at least you can get a night off. The girl then kept making my sandwich. She didn't smile once. I get it. Work sucks. It's always gonna suck. Keep it to yourself. I've worked CS jobs all my life. Suck it up and keep it in the back of house."}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood Subway that I've been frequenting for the past 15 years. The bread is always fresh and they're always willing to make your sandwich exactly how you want it. My go-to sandwiches are either the BBQ rib or Subway Melt on Italian Herbs and Cheese. Clean location, open late and tastes great!"}
{"text":"subway is like mcdonalds for me... i don't even like it that much, but i just can't help eating it sometimes. that being said, this particular subway was, well, just like every other subway ever. the sandwiches are tasty but grossly under filled. there honestly isn't much else i can even say about subway."}
{"text":"This place is very ghetto. I've eaten here only once and I will never go back. The worst Subway I have ever eaten at and I've eaten in DC and Maryland. The staff seemed to have an attitude with everything. The store was dirty and the outside of the store was dirty."}
{"text":"By far the cleanest subway I have ever been in. The staff is extremely friendly as well!!"}
{"text":"Subway! Market...fresh..every..day? 

Subway is a frequent go-to for me since it's close to my classes and research building, and the $5 foot longs are great for lunch and saving the other half for dinner. I would say this place is pretty standard, compared to others. The staff are usually nice and have gotten my back when I forgot my wallet, or when they just wanna give free cookies (yayy! Shout out to less-young Filipino lady working). The line at this location can be backed up like crazy though, so I try to avoid it as much as possible when 10a classes get out and especially when 1130a classes get out (ay caramba, foreal). Unfortunately, summer hours are limited here and this location is only open during session 3 until 2p. 

I appreciate they have regular iced tea options too! Makes staving off from soda a lot easier."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and  it has to be one of the  busiest Subway sandwich shops in all of the Las Vegas Valley. I know for fact that the food is really fresh just by the amount of people that walking in and out that door ordering sandwiches every day. The only reason I would give this Subway a three star ranking, is because the staff is really slow, they seem inexperience and at times it takes forever to get our sandwiches.

To the management, my recommendation would be to improve your staffing and your score will improve incredibly!"}
{"text":"Ok so  they were out of the kinda Bread I wanted, then the young lady told me no one eats that typ of bread any way.  I asked for black olives on my salad and the same young lady, makes a comment about how ucckky that looks and she can't seem look at black olives on a salad.   Today your out of Tuna, the next time your out of cheese, next week the soda is out.  Come On!  One let down after another.......!"}
{"text":"With Jimmy Johns right a cross the street, this Subway has picked up their game......  Good sandwiches, fast service and the staff are extremely friendly....."}
{"text":"Good quality sandwich for the price. Bonus is that they are nice to you!! Extra bonus is that they have diet sandwiches and baked chips and 5 calorie drinks to meet my dietary needs. I eat here for lunch almost once a week because of the nutrition aspect. It's quick, easy and affordable. Plus being nice to me by greeting me and acknowledging my presence is a bonus."}
{"text":"When we arrived at subway, there was one person  attending the sandwich bar. The second was off in a corner mopping the floor, and the first left the bar multiple times until the second came in and relieved the first.

We ordered 3 sandwiches: turkey breast, BMT, and Chicken Caesar Melt. They did not know how to make the Melt, and instead prepared it like a rotisserie chicken sandwich, and even forgot the Caesar dressing altogether.

When we went to get our drinks, I wanted lemonade, but it was water instead. I got Sprite instead of dealing with whatever headache replacing the lemonade would cause.

Overall, this Subway has always had issues, but this was our worst visit."}
{"text":"Just as Russ R. said, you know what you're getting here. I frequently go here for lunch and I've yet to have a poor experience. 

Don't be phased by a long line of hungry customers. They hustle and will clear a 10 person line in about 4 minutes without sacrificing quality of the sandwiches. 

For blazing fast service, arrive before or after the 12:00 hour. When I do that, I'm in there no longer than a few minutes.

The guys tend to rotate their duties weekly, but they're all friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I won't be going to this subway anymore. My bread was burnt and it was also stale. My sandwich was also made very poorly."}
{"text":"Came in with kids sunday. Three employees in back but only one actually working (typical lazy ass Las Vegas employees). 5 people in line; line not moving. Seats and tables a mess with old food crumbs. After making our food they forgot to ring me up and I stood at counter for 10 mins like an idiot. Then the cashier forgot what we ordered. 

Getting a sandwich should not take 30 mins.

And I know its a tourist area but 3 sandwiches and 3 sodas... $40 really ?!?!"}
{"text":"The BEST Subway location I have ever experienced! Great upscale location near the Scottsdale Greenbelt. Lively lunch crowd, spotlessly clean and comfortable, fresh food and pleasant, efficient distaff. Very pleasant lunch..."}
{"text":"Short and Sweet.  This subway is one of my fave's.  Its close to home, always super clean, the staff is always overly friendly, they make my sandwiches quickly and I'm always in and out in about 4 minutes.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge subway fan when it comes to taste/flavor, regardless they are consistent (which I cant say for some much higher priced hoggie/sub and sandwich shops).  This particular store is open 24 hours - I appreciate that, a LOT.  Its a great late night alternative to the fast food competitors - you certainly feel better in the morning and its better for you.  I've been here a dozen or more times - no problems with the staff - they do their job."}
{"text":"Rude employee. I ordered sub and sat down to eat and was asked to leave cause they were closing right at 9:00 pm. You could have said something when I was paying and not be so rude about it. I will not be returning to this location where there is no customer service. Smh"}
{"text":"Place is clean, service is good, staff is friendly, sandwiches were made well. My only complaint is I wish the sandwiches were a little cheaper. Other than that you can never go wrong with a quick sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"Okay so let's start with their broken oven. Really? Can't even get a toasted sandwich here. Next I spend 20 bucks on two foot longs and two drinks. What the hell happened to 5 or 6 dollar footlongs. Damn the economy made subway twice as expensive. You'd think if they are charging 10 bucks a sandwich they'd atleast give you good food. In my sandwich was rotten lettuce and a jalepeno stem. Not the part you eat literally the stem. Hard as a rock inedible stem."}
{"text":"If I could give less then one star I would. Terrible experience at this location yesterday.  Don't ever try to order more then 5 sandwiches at a time they will refuse you and tell you they need a 2 hr notice!  They r SANDWICHES!!! Not gourmet meals
So had to play their stupid little game.  Order 5 and then get back in line for the last 2.  Mind you they weren't busy.   But that's \"their policies that went into effect 2 weeks ago\".  Wouldn't want to violate that!!! Piss off your customers but keep corporate happy  no common sense of customers service.
So a couple days after I sent an email to corporate office complaining. I get a call from a store manager (I think) apologizing for the experience.  She said they were wrong to refuse me my order AND said there was no such policy---SMACK throw your employees under the bus, and she wanted to know WHO waited on me so she could talk to them...\"so sorry, and I assure you it won't happen again\".  You darn right it won't because I will Not be returning to your store ever!  No mention of any compensation of any kind, throw me a cookie or bag of chips, make it look like you somewhat care.  I can buy my own cookies and chips but at least the gesture would have been appreciated"}
{"text":"Pathetic attempt to serve food. Products are very overpriced and the quality is awful. They try to milk money every chance they get. I will only go to order a small bag of baked Lay's ."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Girl making my sandwich had a nose ring like a bull! Acted like this was her 1st day on the job!! No meatball sub no steak sub. This happens way too many times!!  I won't ever go back to this location!! Oh I asked for my receipt she said it was broken!!"}
{"text":"It's a Subway. Its food requires no review. The location though is this Subway's downfall. I would not be comfortable bringing my family to this location.  The staff is friendly and bi-lingual."}
{"text":"I figured this out I think this is a franchise location not a corp owned and this would be the reason for them not having all there inventory up to stock standards they didn't have lil cups for sides and they did not have bell peppers. Employee was using profanity. Very unprofessional and ghetto service. I will never come back to this place. I still enjoyed the sandwich and it was a little dirty they are slow with service and very unorganized. They look like there tripping over each other."}
{"text":"Awesome Subway! I frequent here as it is the  closest location to my job. I keep reading reviews about the people that work here and the sandwich quality, etc. But honestly I've had pretty good experiences here. The people are always friendly and the sandwiches are good. They take their time on each one and always chat and ask how my day is going. No I was not paid off or bribed into writing a good review, I just like this Subway and know they will make my sandwich right."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and efficient. I come here often as it's on the way to work. Downside is, it's always hot and stuffy inside, as if the A/C isn't on. Can make for an uncomfortable meal while dining in. Friendliness of the staff makes it more bearable.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Today, 24 hours after posting a complaint on \"Subway's\" website, I was contacted by the owner of the location and offered a bonus if I went back. I am thoroughly impressed with the speed of his response and the fact that I was apologized to. This manager seems to be someone who really cares about his restaurant. I will be re-posting after going back. Who knows, everyone has a bad day, maybe that was the issue."}
{"text":"Beyond my usual \"chains are chains\" commentary, I will give this subway serious props. It's definitely on my list of top locations, and certainly the best I've been to in the valley. I grabbed the Spicy Italian on this specific trip and it was made fast and fresh. On par for what I expect from Subway. 

I give the guy working tonight major props, there was a huge line that never seemed to end but he kept his cool and did his best to crank out everyone's sandwich. There were even a couple of people in front of me who were snippy or pulled the ever vague \"I want everything on it.\" with no further direction and he catered to everyone. Good service!"}
{"text":"This is by far the cleanest subway I've been to. They were very nice and knew what they were doing."}
{"text":"The slowest subway I ever been too !! Way does it take 20min to get a sub !!!!!! At 3am !!!"}
{"text":"I would rather go to the older subway then the new one! the women seem to be a little rude. The drive through is a little slow and its really sloppy making. I went in the other day and there was a guy already standing in line NO GIRLS to be found... I had saw one girl sitting outside when I pulled into the parking spot and thought she was on break! guess she wasn't all 3 of them were out back talking no one in the store! I asked the guy how long hed been standing in the store and he said 5min waiting on some one to come in!!! they didn't even know he was in there..... the girls response after she came in knowing I walked in the store.... \"i told them to come in but they didn't want to so i had to\".... how rude! honestly,,,, I'm really glad that guy had a good sense of humor because i wouldn't have been so nice!"}
{"text":"This is a Subway restaurant where they make sub sandwiches. The people who will make them for you are called 'Sandwich Artists.' I'm not sure if they went to Art school. They are friendly but not in a way people are friendly when they know they're getting a 15-20% tip. The sandwiches you order are not bad. I have a soft spot for the Meatball sub perhaps because I associate it with the painful reminders of a night gone horribly wrong."}
{"text":"I love subway, just not this one. Missing some free fixins. Help is untrained and slow. Never been asked if I want lettuce in my salad.  Could be because they had very little in the containers. Most Subways have a hard time closing the lid on chopped salad because it is so full. Not this Subway ...  the point of going to a chain is consistency of product. These people need to go to training. The young man slicing bread was the only one with a clue. Cashier was pouty."}
{"text":"Russell is short tempered and rude but a good experience on the whole anyways. Your fairly standard Subway experience."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, love the Turkey sandwich on wheat."}
{"text":"I read a bunch of pretty bad reviews about this location, but because of it's proximity to the Mesa Arts Center we had to give it a shot. Other than the tomatoes being over ripe, and the sandwich artist not smiling once, it was good. I didn't see the issues with skimpy ingredients or napkin rationing that others did, but maybe I got lucky. One knock was the locking bathroom doors... they are controlled by a remote that the employee carries around. When my daughter was exiting the bathroom she had a hard time with the latch and we had to pull the door open for her. Can you guys get that fixed before someone becomes trapped in your bathroom? That would be greeeaaat, thanks."}
{"text":"i walked in. the one guy was making a pizza. the other guy was washing his hands another guy came out from behind didnt wash his hands or put gloves on grabbed the white sheet of paper and said can i help you. \"NO\" you didnt wash your hands. oh well i was just asking. nah i'll take the guy that did wash his hands. and so I asked for the manager there isnt one there. the one guy that was making pizza said he didnt see a problem. Oh really!!! There are health rules you go by when dealing with food and the public, I said uh its okay i'll call corporate and the health board. so the clean guy made my sandwich with a smile. I didnt catch his name but he was very nice. I did call corp. told them my story. i get a phone call today and the girl is like um whats the problem. lol. Really you too are young and dumb and dont know what is up after i nicely called and reported that your employee  wasnt going by state law, that prohibits bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods and requires good hand washing by food service workers!!! over all the guy that did make my sandwich it was very good. so big i had to give half of it to my brother. A foot long spicey italian for only 4.99 daily. that is a deal."}
{"text":"Great service. Very friendly and helpful workers. They got my requests correct and very knowledgeable when I asked questions. My new location."}
{"text":"I love Subway and not all of them still have the seafood salad. This one does and that's the only sandwich I get and I get it often so it's nice when  I'm remembered. I just wish they had a frequent visit card."}
{"text":"Sat night...rude guy rushing being counter....customers? Yeah just 2 of us. End result=messy sandwiches!!! 
Too bad subway wasn't \"make your own\"...you gotta rely on these monkeys to make what is supposed to be a simple sandwich. They make things so hard for nothing!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! I have been to various subways and this location is pathetic! On this day we ordered 3 sandwiches: chicken breast, chipotle chicken and a kids turkey. For one thing we had to say the order like 4 x. The 2 ladies couldn't get it right....lol! Then this guy with a mustache was gonna make the chicken breast and not even microwave the chicken!! We had to ask for it to be heated up....that's standard of the chicken. Geez....slow as hell and just a bunch of idiots - I'm sorry but yes the service was that bad!  Like I said I been to a lot of subways and I know it's not expected to have stellar service but at least decent service with people who understand how to take an order. This location is always so disappointing.  Who hires these people?!?!"}
{"text":"One star because zero wasn't an option...
Just a friendly reminder that if you hate your job and you can't \"fake it til you make it\" AND you're in customer service, then do us all a favor and QUIT because no one wants your attitude. Grrrr I hate to post negative stuff but my daughter and I went to the Subway at Greenway and Cotton and got the worst service ever. It was very clear to me that the two girls there (one of which appeared to be the manager) hated their jobs and each other. Neither of them smiled the entire time we were there. The one girl rang me up before she put our toppings on which was weird but whatever. Then the \"manager\" had to go in the back to get more guac and when she came back and was wrapping my sandwich up, she went to the register and I said \"I already paid.\" She tells us \"thanks, have a good night\" with zero eye contact and no smile. (Mind you, I was willing to let all of this go.) We get all the way to the door, and she yells \"did you even pay for your guac?\" Oh my...now I'm heated. I say \"I don't know, why don't you ask her. She rang me up.\" Like really, I was half way out the door, it's 75 cents, no one is trying to steal guac...coach your employee after the fact, she knew I got guac. So I walked back in and up to the register and I say \"why don't you just ask her?\" \"Oh I'm looking it up right here.\" Really!!! So she shows me a receipt listing 2 turkey subs and says \"is this you?\" Uhhhh how the hell would I know. I said \"probably.\" Wow wow wow, so I gave the beach a dollar and left. Like really??? I cannot believe it. I am a manager in retail and I cannot believe this woman still has a job. Learn to treat people with respect."}
{"text":"Sounds cheesy maybe but Subway is my favorite place to eat for a quick, healthy under $ 10 meal. They are always efficient and their sandwiches are consistently good and taste fresh. I always get the same when I go: turkey on honey oat bread...

 I kind of blow the healthy equation every time I go there since I add two cookies to the sandwich and considering they are worth 210 calories each, yikes to the belly!

The staff is always friendly and eager to please. Some have more attitude than others (you know who you are) but that makes the visits interesting and lively!

If you are pressed for time and don't want to break the bank and yet want to eat healthy, it's hard to beat Subway....not even a burger joint can come close!"}
{"text":"Bad service. They sell donuts as well but good luck getting g any service if you stand near the donut counter. Get someone who takes care of that or don't sell them!"}
{"text":"I usually only end up going to subway late at night but them being open 24/7 is so convenient. Cliff is usually always there when me and my sister come in. He is hilarious and is one of the reasons we choose to come to this location over others in the area. A+ for customer service"}
{"text":"I stopped in on my way home on a Mon. night at 7 PM to pick up a sandwich. The place was empty. I ordered a tuna sub. The nice guy behind the counter told me they were out of tuna salad. And mayonnaise. And onions. He said the manager hadn't ordered a supply truck for the week. They will be out of those items until next week. What kind of a manager is that? I ordered a \"specialty,\" a BMT. I got it home and sat down to eat. The sandwich was very tasteless, unless you count the nasty bagged lettuce taste when you take a bite. Why do restaurants use bagged lettuce when it's so easy to cut head lettuce? Shortcuts. And if they take a shortcut with something that easy to prepare, they take shortcuts on everything. If I get a bagged taste at any restaurant, it's my last visit,"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Subway several times when I have to  go to Charlotte to visit my Mom when she has been hospitalized to avoid the high cafeteria prices of the hospitals.
I had lunch here today an even though it was very busy, the line moved quickly. All employees had a smile on their face and were very friendly and pitched in to keep the line moving. In no time I had my Buffalo Chicken sandwich and was eating lunch.
I also like that Subway now has a 6\" sandwich and a 21oz drink for lunch for $4,$5, or $6 depending on which sandwich you order.
I don't know who owns this Subway, but he/she is doing something right!
I wish the Subway near my house was as fast and friendly as this one!"}
{"text":"++ Decided a place couldn't be a failure all the time right? Drive up for drive thru and was told someone will be with me soon -- we left after 5mins of radio silence. Smh. This was at 10am with one car in the parking lot and no other cars in drive thru ???????

Love Subway for a quick meal and we frequent the Warm Springs/Buffalo location because of the drive thru.  Half the time they get it wrong... the order taker is almost always rude.  Okay whatever because how excited can you sound taking sandwich orders all day?  But when you're paying for \"deluxe\" sandwiches you expect some effort.  They take your full order up front and I feel like they don't even write it down and go off memory.  Which is why the sandwiches are come out wrong because they forget items or make things up in their head instead of clarifying the order.  

- Ordered vinegar but got mayo
- Ordered american cheese but got NO cheese 
- Ordered extra olives but got only 5 pieces if any...seriously??? 

You can't expect customers to open the sandwich up at the drive thru to check their order before driving off (out of courtesy for those behind you in line who have waited long just as you have)...So I'll just leave this review & take my business elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I stopped by this Subway on my way back to Tucson. I don't have any complaints about the staff, cleanliness of the store, nor the food since all were just fine - keep in mind I was only there for 5 minutes at most. 

I ordered ahead on Subway's website, so by the time I got to the store, the sandwich was already made. The staff was friendly and the store was clean. 

The only bad thing I encountered was the smell of cow manure from somewhere nearby... hahaha"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Subway, and I have been to this location many times before. However, I have never had such a rude employee. I went in there with my boyfriend to get dinner at 8:30pm. I work graveyard so this is a normal time for us. I will point out now that both employees had no name badges. I start to make my order and the lady gave me an attitude as if she couldn't hear me, I brushed it off, then I repeat myself, she grabs the bread and snaps \"what meat?\" I repeat saying \"spicy Italian please.\" \"What cheese?\" More attiude, \"Swiss for the wheat, pepperjack for the italian herb.\" She throws the cheese on the bread, not even made just a pile of cheese, grabs the meat and doesn't even give us a lot of meat. Brush it off, she snaps if we want it toasted or not, his yes, mine no. Here's where it gets worse, I start telling her what I wanted, attitude after attitude, now is where I NEVER have had a problem at ANY SUBWAY. I wanted extra olives. Like, a lot of olives, I'm even willing to pay for it. She barely gives me any, then when I ask for more, like, a lot more, \"I can't give you more, it's a footlong.\" My boyfriend says \"really? We come here all the time and we have never have had that problem.\" She puts on a few more, and I mean a pinch more.\" I am trying to stay calm because she gave an attitude to him as well. I become tempted to walk out, but I am starving. He finishes his and he is having issues as well. We pay, we leave. I get home and find hair in my sandwich. Not mine, I have long black hair, boyfriend has short black hair, this was short and grey, like the ladies who \"helped\" us. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Horrible service, food looked disgusting, wasn't even chilled properly. Just gross."}
{"text":"I've gone to this location several times and been met with bad attitudes and lazy employees. The location on Ft. Apache is much better."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches but was aggravated because they don't accept American express credit cards."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place a good review.  They should teach a seminar on getting through a lunch rush line - they are THAT good at it.  This place always gets slammed at lunch during the week and I can still get in and out in under 5 minutes.

I say I WAS going to give it a good review because, as soon as I clicked on it, I remembered the experience I had a year ago.  I was buying some sandwiches to take to a ballgame and the little guy behind the counter decided he would argue with me about what I wanted on my sub.  He starts mouthing stuff under his breath and I call him out on it.  The manager intervened but did nothing to punish the employee or to compensate me.  Never saw that little guy after that but I hope he is gone."}
{"text":"This is the most understaffed Subway in Phx.  There is no doubt in my mind that it will easily take me 20 minutes to get in and out of this Subway.  The problem with that is that I am usually trying to catch a movie.  It really gets frustrating to watch one person do all three parts of the job alone while some kid sits in the back and acts like they are busy.  

All of that being said, this Subway is consistent and usually tastes good.  The place is always clean and the workers TRY to move you through as fast as possible."}
{"text":"How could any subway NOT be 5 stars? I mean you make your own sandwich.... I guess the staff could be rude but I doubt it here."}
{"text":"I don't know if all Subway locations are like this but these guys are absolutely incompetent! 

Make sure to watch them as they make your sub because these 'artists' like to take creative liberties.

Sometimes toasted is forgotten, cheese is omitted and salt and pepper are laid on so thick they should be charged as their own condiment.

The staff is slow and if you happen to be there when there is a lineup, they will actually make everyone's sub first THEN they will let you pay. This means that your sub's path from oven to mouth may take you over 10 minutes on a busy day."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Fresh ingredients! If you like subway, this is a good one :) Mario was our sandwich maker and he is the best!!! Apparently this doesn't count as a review unless it's long enough soooooo... Order the chicken bacon ranch on italion herb and cheese"}
{"text":"I would give this store a zero if were an option. I'm don't think it's that difficult to make a basic sandwich. When the emoloyee messed up the order she told us whatever, accidents happen and didn't correct it. The employee told us she was the supervisor when we requested to speak or have the name of supervisor. Later found out she wasn't. They ran out of mayo and she said she couldn't go to the back to get more. On a second visit after speaking to the manager, who offered two free sandwiches to compensate, this same lovely employee argued with us that we could not get a free meal.  To say service was bad and employee was rude is a complete understatement! She need to be fired!!! 

To add...this location is also always under stocked and runs out of food.,"}
{"text":"Came in late on Fri 4/13, because the other subway near my house was advertised as open late but was not, I was really jonesing for a turkey breast footlong!

Kaylee was amazing! Thanks for the yummy sub!"}
{"text":"I visit this Subway multiple times a month and have never had a bad experience except one time. I realize it can get a little bit busy on occasion, which is to be expected at any place during lunch hour, so if an employee appears frustrated I don't hold it against them. The issue was, the two girls working behind the counter had completely run out of bread...and  I mean completely. All they had left was wraps. Now, I worked at Brueggers Bagels during my college years, and I understand you need to take care of the customer first... so it may seem wrong at the time to excuse yourself from the front in order to go pull some bread to bake.... but in the long run, how many more upset customers will you have when you tell them you don't have any bread at all? Just my opinion, but I feel it could have saved these two poor girls from many angry customer complaints that day!"}
{"text":"There were two girls scheduled to work and only one actually working.  The other was doing something with a clipboard and kept running her pen up and down the page and glancing at us as we waited to be assisted.  As a side note to this person, you have a job because of customers.  Customers should ALWAYS come first. 

The food was good, it's Subway and it's one of those things where once you've had one you've had them all.  

The prep area was not stocked - the young lady had to run back to the back twice for two difference condiments and did NOT wash her hands upon returning. The drink station was extremely limited in it's offerings and the lady that helped us gave us no napkins.

(on the plus side, this is one of the only Subways I've seen that carries peanut butter cookies, but they were just \"ok\" nothing to write home about)."}
{"text":"Sandwich was good but barely added avocado to my sandwich and the tea tasted bad. Not much in stock as far as chips go. Won't be coming back here. One person was pretty nice but not everyone working was friendly or engaging."}
{"text":"I wanted something healthy and instead of White Castle or other fried foods I ended up here. Subway was about 2-3 dollars more than I would spend at a Subway in DC metro. It was a little annoying because it wasn't the best subway I ever had. It was mediocre and Subways only saving grace was it allowed me to eat something that wasn't fried."}
{"text":"Adequate Subway for a downtown location, and I admire the patience of the staffer who served the guy in front of me (who eccentrically asked for two cucumbers on one side of the sandwich, one on the other, and proceeded to do this micromanagement with *very friggin' ingredient* in the sandwich). That said, it's a downtown location - the floors and tables hadn't been wiped down in a while, and I had to negotiate a hobo in front, which I realize the store can't do anything about, but which really takes the shine off a meal."}
{"text":"I love subway, but this one is pitiful. The new owner sucks, and so do the employees. Their sign says they open at 7:00am, I came at 7:52am and they weren't open. I waited and they decided to open the doors around 8am. They still weren't ready... I had to wait additional time for them to prep everything... The one bigger girl that works there always has an attitude and is insulted that you come to subway to get her to make your freakin sandwich."}
{"text":"This a great clean fast establishment to grab a quick sub . The staff are very friendly and quick especially when I'm on break. Nice large sitting area all remodeled and they are always cleaning in here a plus Kudos Subway!"}
{"text":"It's rare that I go to a subway where they give me the right amount of toppings as I've asked or my honey mustard drenched as I've also asked. Most of the time they're stingy.  Ally veggies were fresh. Area was extremely clean as well. Sam made my sandwich and he has wonderful customer service. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I went to get my healthy meal after the gym. I never had a bad experience at subway before but LET ME TELL YOU THIS LOCATION IS SOMETHING ELSE!! They put the bare minimum veggies when you ask for more. The highlight of my visit was when i asked for extra spinach and the guy literally put two leafs of spinach. It was the most awkward thing ever!! I didnt say anything out of respect but i will never go back."}
{"text":"Just stop here fresh and friendly place got my food and was pleased with the service.  It's new years post eve and I enjoyed the great conversation made my stop awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff at this location are so awesome super friendly and what I appreciate the most is the acknowledgement when you walk in the door even if there's a line they make sure they say hi .   I go out my way to this location because of the staff , cleanliness and consistent sandwiches."}
{"text":"I ordered a Subway Club online through Grub Hub last Thursday with all my fixins on it. When I received my sandwich there was no meat at all. I called the restaurant and was told by the employee she didn't know how to pull up online orders so the delivery guy showed her the order on his tablet and said there was no meat. Why would I order a sandwich with multiple meats if I didn't want meat?! She's not apologetic at all just blames it on the delivery guy, which isn't a Subway employee. Then she says \"well I don't know what to tell you other than you can come get a new sandwich\". I ordered and paid for delivery but now I have to use my gas to fix an incompetent employees mistake. Well there was no way that was happening. I of course asked for a manager to be told she'd be there the next morning. I called multiple times before finally getting an answer the next morning and spoke to the manager, Maria. I explained what happened and she took my info and pulled my order confirming I indeed ordered a sandwich with meat. She was not very helpful at all. She actually asked me what I wanted her to do to about this then tells me she has to speak to her corporate office. I'm beyond furious and will never order from Subway again in life!!!!"}
{"text":"The rudeness of the African American man that helped me was unreal, I almost left.
I can't believe this. Unreal, if a manager cares and want to contact me I will give details.
Would definitely not go there again."}
{"text":"This is a standard location. Nothing out of the ordinary here. On my last visit I tried their new raspberry cheesecake cookies. Interesting but not really worth getting again."}
{"text":"Several years ago I worked in the area and would hit this place up for a quick sandwich. Then I moved to Toronto for 5 years. Now I'm back working in the same area and I go in here to find many of the same staff working here still!

Expect a solid line at this location during the week from 11:30 - 1:15ish. To match the line inside, the parking lot is also a disaster during lunch too. Outside of those times you can practically walk right in without having to wait."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is the best word to describe this location. It's fine, there's nothing really wrong with it, but nothing really great either. It's clean, there's a handful of tables to sit at, the staff aren't completely terrible, and the food will live up to your expectations."}
{"text":"Weird experience here. The lady making my footlong made it like it was two six inch sandwiches. She put the meat and cheese on the flat bread with a definitive gap in the middle, then cut it in half. She then put all the veggies on like it was a footlong. So when I went to eat it everything fell out in the middle when I pulled the two halves apart because none of the veggies were cut.

I really don't get it."}
{"text":"Fast, simple and in a convenient location. To me at least, the service was good and they were fast even during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Zero stars! Just stopped by this subway since it's the closest to my home. I love subway and every location I go to people are so friendly and make great sandwiches.. except this location. There was an African American  guy working there who was SO unfriendly! Didn't say hi when people were walking in, you could just tell this guy hated his job. His sandwiches were awful! No veggies at all! I had to keep asking for more lettuce 3x before I got a normal amount. And I'm not one of those people to complain but I'm not eating a sandwich with 5 pieces of lettuce! Most horrible experience I have ever had. Will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and have had bad experiences each time. The employees are just plain rude. There's got to be at least 5 different employees I've seen there and not one has ever smiled. They didn't give me my change and I had to ask for it myself. I work in customer service and find this absolutely ridiculous. The only reason I come back is because it's close and I love sandwiches."}
{"text":"A Subway is a Subway is a Subway, in general. The food is typical Subway. I have never had a bad experience with any of the sandwiches that I have bought here. The service is standard. If you like Subway in general, then you'll like this place."}
{"text":"It's a Subway, so no sense reviewing the food. Four stars is probably the top rating possible for this chain. That said:

The location is great. Right next to the 51. I like to go to nearby Country Boys, my favorite \"super cheap breakfast\" spot, and then buy a Subway sandwich for later in the day. Then hop right on the freeway.

The dining room is larger than most Subways. You can stay and eat here comfortably without being bothered by others waiting for their food. Clean and well kept.

Staff is friendly and efficient, at least I have never had any issues in my few visits."}
{"text":"It's a Subway. No need to comment about the food. But the servers, let's call them sandwich artists, are friendly and fast at this location, deserving of a review. I've come here for years. The faces change, but the service is quite consistent, indicating this franchise is well managed. I've also witnessed them using temperature probes on more than one occasion, testing the safety of their meats... reassuring. About to walk into The Oink Cafe next door? Perhaps pass on the bacon and opt for a healthier choice at Subway."}
{"text":"This Subway always comes in clutch when I am starving. It's 24 hour drive thru that is right off the freeway is so useful and the staff is ALWAYS so friendly and patient when i'm ordering! Food is always tasty and cookies are always fresh! Need more of these 24 hour drive thrus everywhere!"}
{"text":"The Indian lady that owns this franchise here is extremely racist and didn't let me use 2 type of breads for 1 sandwich even tho I was willing to pay more ughh hopefully subway sees this and stops her rain #sandwich#nazi"}
{"text":"I love subway vegetables are always fresh and they always make it just as you like it totally recommended"}
{"text":"Just went in and had the absolute worst customer service ever at subway. Just because you probably got stuck working a Sunday night doesn't mean you have to emit that bitterness to the customer. I walked in and waited forever for someone to come out from back. Then someone finally came and this skinny white dude didn't even acknowledge my prescence. No hi, nothing! Long story short the kid made my sandwich with attitude. Never makes for a yummy sandwich! Now it's a shit sandwich which I'm still going to eat because I'm hungry! Ha. Then he checks me out and doesn't even hand me my sandwich and bag, I had to practically reach  over the counter to get it. Maybe if you're so unhappy with your life you should do something about it!"}
{"text":"For a Subway.. This is the best one I have been to. It's right by my office, so I have only been there during lunch time. The staff is awesome. I am always greeted when entering. The workers are fast, and get your order right every time. One of their employees during the lunch shift seems to keep it all together. He manages the other employees well ,and is extremely friendly. Not sure what his name is.. but someone needs to give the black dude with the earrings a big raise. As far as Subway goes, this one is the best-"}
{"text":"I ordered online...twice and both orders were screwed up! Don't go this Subway! There are stores close by with much better ratings!

Here is the score card:
ordered mayo & deli mustard...got NONE!
ordered a 20oz bottle of Coke...he handed me a cup!
Asked that each half be wrapped separately...halves wrapped together...
I ordered a \"meal\" yet he handed me the sandwich and said \"have a nice day...NO meal!

it is on the order...clearly printed! How do you screw that up? but they did...TWICE!"}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service :)

I said vegetarian sandwich, and he automatically got new gloves and a new knife for me. Actually help me to the beginning to end."}
{"text":"This is probably the best subway I've ever been to. My son and I come here often. Usual drill is I pick him up after school and we grab a bit to eat cuz he's \"starving\" (teen boy is always hungry). He likes subway and with the $3 sub of the day deal it doesn't kill my pocket. :D
That's not why I prefer this subway. It's the people. They're sweet gals, happy and even though my free cookie coupon is expired they still take it. 

The restroom is clean too!"}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service. In and out. Spacious store. Well put sandwich together and not soggy after I get home with the dressing in it. I will be back though my only gripe is parking is not so easy so you have to park on the street. Yay for Subway's $5 footlong. Fantastic deal and fresh. Can't be beat. I agree with Ronald."}
{"text":"Went here tonight to get late night dinner, and their credit card system was down. Since there was no note and I had to wait for the employee to spend 5 minutes discussing what to do with his boss, I was rather pissed when he refused to buy my sandwich. Horrible customer service, never go here!! YOUR CREDIT CARD PROBLEM IS NOT MINE, UNLESS THERE'S A NOTE ON THE DOOR OR REGISTER AND I'M NOTIFIED IN ADVANCE! THANKS!"}
{"text":"Pro-Went closer to closing and the worker hooked it up. Customer satisfaction was definitely important to him. Con- Touched too many non food items with the same pair of gloves as I see at most subways."}
{"text":"I never write these but I just had to for this subway. One of the worst I've been to. I feel bad for the employees because they seem to just completely hate you and their lives.
No one smiles and you feel unwelcome."}
{"text":"I HATE giving negative reviews to places, but this subway deserves it. Its right next to my house so its very convenient though I rather not go here and recommend not to go here either. 

It was mid night and it was the graveyard worker and since they are open 24 hours there is only one worker. I walk in after work and I say hello to the guy. He didn't say anything at all nore did he respond and he was just sitting there at one of tbe tables on his phone with his shoes off. Kinda gave me a bad Impression. I just shrugged this off. When he gets behind the counter to start making my sandwich I try to start a conversation saying, \"how's your night going bro?\" Still no respond. Either he had a really shitty day or he was just rude as fuck. So that was strike 2. Right before he puts his gloves on, 1. He didn't even wash his hands and 2. He touched his nose thumb and index finger right in front of me then put the gloves on. I was standing there saying in my mind WHAT THE FUCKKK???? I am not a mad guy in general so I kindly just say, \"hey bud im good man you touched your nose so I don't want anything.\" Thats strike 3. Last thing was he laughed out loud right after...strike 4. 

If you work somewhere regardless if you love it or not, your job is the thing that brings the money...even if you work at subway. I hope.management reads this and to the guy who was there, grow up buddy...."}
{"text":"Ordered my sandwich and the girl (Evelyn) who couldn't get a job at McDonald's waits till my sandwich is half way down the production line to tell me that they have no lettuce. Wtf? How about telling us before we place our order?"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here while visiting Arizona from California, we found this Subway excellent, clean, friendly and very good food. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Don't go to this subway.  A worker was inside was chanting some crazy shit.  Stay away"}
{"text":"Contrary to Heather C.'s review of this Subway establishment, I found it to be quite exemplary. The decor was the now-standard Subway interior which consisted of well lit images of fresh produce and Jared. I had no qualms regarding the service either. The bistro was clean and even had a conservatory/greenhouse area that looked out upon the quiet main street, Main Street. If I should ever have the joy of returning to Sun Prairie and am in the need of a sandwich this establishment will be top of mind. Four Stars."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about but convenient and good value for the money. No restrooms. $3.00 breakfast which is a coffee or soda drink and a six inch egg and meat sub. I keep coming back for quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Mediocre as compared to other Subway's, parking is very limited.   Very cheap on toppings and they try to charge 1.00 for gluten free bread but it actually is not stated anywhere so they technically should not be charging.  Ask for your money back if they do, I did and go my dollar back"}
{"text":"I am giving a 5 star rating not because I think Subway is a 5 star restaurant, but because of the service. At most Subways around Phoenix, the service leaves much to be desired (and occassionally straight pisses you off). Every time I've been to this location, the employees have been incredibly friendly and make your sandwich with care. Whoever owns this franchise obviously pays attention during interviews."}
{"text":"My roommate and I have managed to stay away from this location for about a year or so, actually driving out of our way to another location if we want to eat Subway. Unfortunately, my roommate gave in to convenience and brought home subs from this one. Even before anything was unwrapped, I just knew it was going to be awful, and I was right.

I'm sorry, but these people have either never been trained on how to make subs, or they've been instructed by the owners to be as skimpy as possible with the toppings. The lettuce was lightly sprinkled on, as if you might add a dash of oregano. At first I thought it had been forgotten! Couldn't detect any crunch whatsoever. I had to open it to find out if there was any on there. There were maybe eight pieces of black olives on the entire footlong sandwich! Even the tomatoes were skimped on by a couple pieces (compared to EVERY OTHER SUBWAY I'VE EVER BEEN TO). So really, our sandwiches were  practically just lumps of wadded up meat and cheese, slathered with a little mayo on bread. This is NOT good to me at all, and not what I want or expect from Subway. We shouldn't have to pay for this garbage! 

So why am I SO incredibly angry right now? James is an a**-h*le and was incredibly rude to my roommate on the phone when he politely called to complain and get the situation rectified. He downright refused to allow him to speak to a manager (or have the manager call him later) and only offered to replace half of my pathetically-made footlong. What about my son's 6\"? The half of my footlong that I did eat? (I was going to bring the other half so they can see how badly it was made.) We were hungry. Are we really expected to stop eating (while very hungry), jump in the car and hurry over there during rush-hour? No, that's not good customer service. We weren't looking for anything extra either, even though it's a pain to drive back to a restaurant because of something they did wrong. We just wanted what we paid for. 

Why are all the other Subways we've been to consistently good and this one consistently sucks? Not the first bad experience with James either (all-around bad attitude) but certainly the last time we spend a dime at this franchise.

We will be talking to corporate about this."}
{"text":"The. Bread. Was. Old.

We walked in and was greeted by the guy behind the counter; he was nice and friendly.  He made the sandwiches as requested. Everything would have been perfect had it not been for the stale wheat bread.

I even read the reviews before going into this Subway shop but I figured it couldn't be that bad, right? I was wrong. 

Never again will I not trust the reviews!"}
{"text":"I think I've been to almost all the Subway within a five miles radius. What keeps me coming to this one? Location.  The employees are friendly and they always get it right but then again I always order the usual which is the Veggie Delite with everything. Bread is always fresh except for on one occasion when I think I got day old bread, but that was a while ago."}
{"text":"This subway is pretty clean and in a good place.  customer service is very slow and too crowded at times.  They try to hurry u up to chose but when u choose what u want they take forever on the rest of the stuff. it is a normal tipical subway but they do need more friendly people."}
{"text":"Really great service.  The gentleman who prepared my cousins and my sandwich was great he suggested things to my cousin to change his sandwich up and a different sauce that would be good. It was good and he really liked it."}
{"text":"Rude service and half assed my salad order. Monotone and no professionalism. I am extremely disappointed and not coming back. You can tell that two of these guys that work the counter don't give a damn about anyone walking in through the door."}
{"text":"First time visit on Halloween in route to a get together. Wanted a quick bite to eat to get the night started. Loved how intimate the setting was. Very clean and the staff is really professional. Loved hearing how they have fun chatting it up with customers as they served them.

The dine in experience was great. Really relaxed and settled. When in the area again, I will stop back for another quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"No surprises here: 
- This location is clean.
- The staff is courteous.  
- The toppings are fresh.
- The specials that are advertised are typically honored here too.  
- If you come during lunch time, be prepared for a wait, but the staff is prepared for the rush and will try to move you out the door. 
- The parking is plentiful and well lit. 
- The dining area is fine. If you stay and eat, or take advantage of the free refills.

*Especially appreciate...
That there are clearly defined choices provided for a leaner sandwich or meal selection.

My issue...
Is with the chain.  For my taste, there is not enough meat on the sandwiches.  You can always pay extra if you'd like four slices of paper thin meat rather than three, but it is what it is."}
{"text":"There is nothing worse than getting an incorrectly folded sandwich from subway. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I have always loved subway. My first job as a kid was working at subway. That being said the customer service at this location is terrible! I went through the drive thru at around 1130 pm and the sign is dark, not lit up. I sat there for 5 or 10 minutes with no voice to acknowledge that i am there. So I finally say hello are you open? I am then met with a smart ass sarcastic voice from what i can tell is a young boy who says to me \"i was with a customer what do you want?!\" As if i am bothering the kid! So i say im sorry to bother you. Then he begins to rant about me being rude for asking if theyre open! I didnt even entertain or argue i simply drove off. Im noticing these days this type of attitude from this generation is common. I will never go back to this establishment. Which is sad because they also have a doughnut place attached."}
{"text":"5-9-2015

I literally had the worst experience at Subway in my life.  I have been going to this Subway for the past year and they have horrible customer service. Today I walk in and now one says hi or greets you... they literally were standing in the back and looked irritated that a customer came in during lunch.  

The only worker at that place is a guy with glasses and tattoos, he has excellent customer service and was the only reason I could give this Subway a star.  Everyone else, including the new guy with the long hair offers horrible service.   Many of the employees don't smile or even thank you after you made your purchase.

I would literally walk out of that Subway unless that one awesome guy with the glasses was working there and serving."}
{"text":"Ordered a buffalo chicken wrap ahead of time and paid for it.  The order wasn't made yet when I arrived because they claimed it was not on the receipt.  It was, they pointed out a moment later.  
Get to work to realize it has ZERO buffalo sauce on it.  Paid $7 for it.    

Called them around 12:15 PM to ask if I was supposed to ask for that separately... (obviously not) and they hung up on me. LOL.  WOW.  There were two people working at that time, it was the dude.


You guys seriously suck.  Worst customer service.   You don't hang up on people FYI.  I'll find another Subway to go to for lunch."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Subway!  After a disappointing experience at the Penguin (resulting in no food), we came over here and had sandwiches and they were wonderful.  

It was also the first bathroom we encountered all day that was clean and had soap in the dispenser. Hooray!"}
{"text":"Rainy day blues? Go to subway and eat fresh.... Right? Wrong. Not only was my sandwich burnt and the customer service was terrible but the food tasted as if they tried to pass on food past the date it was good by. Disgusting. Eye rolls from the girls behind the counter was the topper. Considering you make the sandwich to my tasting if I say light ranch, and you put too much on.... Just take it off. But they were too interested in being back on their cellphones. Wow."}
{"text":"Standard Subway.
I've never had a problem with my food- but there's sometimes a wait.

Less of a drink selection than other subways."}
{"text":"The white bread is dried out. The help is rude. You can't change a $50.00 
bill at lunch time. 
When asked for a tuna the fellow scooped it on the bread and spread it out with the cheese. 
I generally order a couple of sandwiches twice a week it's hard to keep going back but I keep hoping it will improve.
No such luck. 
I asked for the owners name and the manager wouldn't give it to me. 
You have a gold mine here but it won't last long, on the path your on."}

{"text":"Credit is due where credit is due !!

We don't usually think of the big businesses as needing or caring about user input or reviews.  But some businesses are so much a part of our everyday lives that we are the ones who forget how needed and important they are to our way of life.  Subways are that kind of business for me -- I am a Registered Piano Technician, and I travel around the entire Phoenix valley, all the time. I noted today that 459 locations are available in the Phoenix valley.   I stopped in a Subway today that happens to be the closest outlet to my home, and got to thinking how glad I am when traveling about to usually have a Subway location available.  The food and the service is always consistent, and I know I can always rely on an interesting and satisfying lunch if I can find a Subway available.  The Subway organization really has their \"act\" down, and it's always the same wherever you go.  They are a real testimony to quality management and quality control in the business world.  They have for years been a big help to me in my travels.  So, Thanks, Subway !!"}
{"text":"Friendly, efficient and fast -- a full house line gets processed no time -- However, I review this particular Subway because it's on my daily route, and the easiest of all Subways for me to drop into for lunch.  Today was completely SPECIAL, however, not the menu but the occasion.  I ordered my usual, one of the daily 6-inch meals, paid the bill, then took a seat and started checking my emails, then, lo and behold, the Manager Roberto walks up to my table and shows me a certificate he is posting on his bulletin board that has my name on it as the \"Customer of the Month\", plus a ticket for a free meal -- Now THAT''s promotion !!  But, notice this happened after the fact, and it didn't take an award to get me to come in -- it is the handy fresh meals that are served by the most efficient staff you can imagine.  Thanks for the recognition, though, and I certainly won't forget your compliment of pinning me up on your Bulletin Board !!  Wes Flinn"}
{"text":"I eat subway at least 3 times for nearly the past decade. Today I had the best made subway sandwich I have ever purchased.  The guy who made my sub didn't have a name tag on or else I would use his name. He was a thin black male with braided hair. I am vegan, so I ordered  the footlong whitebread with all the veggies. This dude stuffed more veggies then I've ever seen stuffed into this sub. Then he rolled the veggies like a spliff into the bread. He totally went above and beyond on this sub, and it came out perfect.  This dude needs to be promoted to sandwich crafting instructor for all of Subway!  I want to buy a Subway location just so I can hire this dude, pay him $25 an hour so he never leaves, and eat there every day.  I'll definitely be hitting up this location more often."}
{"text":"It's a Subway so you kinda know what you get. I just wish they would do a better job running the tweakers off who try to sell you stuff and hit you up for $$. Then again not the greatest neighborhood so should be expected."}

{"text":"I was really hungry, so I too advantage of the (50%more) free upgrade on the meat on my 6\" steak and cheese sub. I'm not a big chip fan, so the (really nice) manager said I could get 2 cookies instead (a real hardship for me). Had a small fountain drink, and paid $7.49.

I had sponach, tomato, onion and provolone cheese on my toasted sub. It was delicious. The free extra meat was a bit too much, and I ended up throwing out the last 2 bites. I ordered the horseradish sauce on the side. It was good and nippy, but kids might not like it.

The storr was spotless,  quiet, and I got an outlet by the pub tables for my dying phone.

Good lunch, accompanied by 80s hits."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for a super late night/ early morning snack (it was 5am). Everything was very clean and The girl working was super nice, had a great attitude, and fast with making our sandwiches. I'm sure working in the middle of the night at a restaurant in Vegas can be interesting and frustrating at times, but she was happy and laughing and joking with us! 
Sandwiches hit the spot!"}
{"text":"When it comes down to a quick and easy meal; Subway is a staple of mine.  Here is my review of the Subway at Sam's Town:

 - For quick access and not having to deal with Casino, park and enter from the south entrance.  It's right there on your right side as you walk in.  

 - I think their strategy of drawing you in is pretty wise.  They keep the door to their place open, so you can smell the fresh bread.

 - I walked in and there were a couple of people ahead of me in line.  And, they were indecisive.  But I wasn't in a hurry so I was okay.

 - I finally ordered my sandwich - Roast Beef w/ avocado and most of the fixin's.  Sans onions and any kind of peppers.  

 - I'm sure they have a set serving size they have to give.  I would have loved more avocado but... I didn't argue.  

 - They bagged up my sandwich with some napkins, I forked over the cash and made a quick exit.  Easy as that!

I give the place 4 stars because it's a chain and I am sure that I would get the same sandwich at any of their locations."}
{"text":"It's a duo - Subway / Winchells donuts.  14 donuts for less than $10.

I needed to find a dozen donuts this afternoon so I can be part of a donut eating competition.  I know, it's juvenile but it's fun to do every once in a while.  So, I drove down Desert Inn Rd. toward the strip from the East Side.  My first stop was at Donut Hut and they close at 11 am on Sundays - What?  Then I went to Donut Master on Desert Inn and Eastern and they had a sign on the door that said they were sold out.  Ugh!!!!  After reading a few reviews I was going to drive to the West Side to Real Donuts but I only had about 20 minutes before they closed.  So, I didn't want to waste my time.  I decided to cut my losses and maybe go to Albertson's or Wal-Mart to get donuts there.  Then, I remembered that there was a Winchell's Donuts connected to a Subway in Boulder Station.  And here is my review of the donuts:

- Boulder Station's parking lot was jammed packed.  But, I was lucky to find a spot close to the door nearest to Winchell's.

- I didn't have any expectations.  I thought that they would have a very poor selection as it was early afternoon.  But, I was pleasantly surprised as they had a small but decent selection.  

- They had a Winchell's Dozen (14) for less than $10.  

- I picked out my donuts... Jelly filled / creme filled chocolate / chocolate bars / and regular raised.

- The girl behind the counter wasn't a talker and just packed my dozen and took my money.  

- And off I go to devour these donuts.

They were fresh and sweet.  I was able to put down 9 for my competition.  I was okay with that.  Good Times!"}
{"text":"Subways are great when you have family come in from out of town and, you just don't want to go out for dinner.  Their prices are good, great selection, and huge portions.  And, who doesn't like a sandwich? No one I tell ya'!  So, the other night I drove a few choice family members to grab sandwiches for everyone.  Turkey, Roast Beef, Club, and B.L.T. were the main orders.  And, within 10 minutes of being there and getting each sandwich made to order, we were out.

No complaints, no problems but no great expectations.

So, as far as Subways go. 4 stars."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I'm a fan of, it's organizing points numerically. 

The second thing I am a fan of is irony, which is why this subway is great. A restaurant known for its healthy meals sharing a building with a Winchell's Doughnuts, priceless. In the 15 or 20 times I've been there, I've maybe seen someone order doughnuts twice, I can't help but feel for the neglected Winchell's employee. In my opinion, they should open another subway in place of the Winchell's, now THAT would be innovative

but I digress... 

The Subway is open 24 hours, and has a drive through. I enjoy the fact  that they keep things extremely clean and they are not stingy with portions. 

I should mention that they have dealt with some credit card fraud so they require ID when you use your card.

Tell them Nathaniel sent you, it won't get you a discount, but it will do wonders for my ego."}
{"text":"All Subway foods probably taste the same- the main difference is service. Some Subways are incredibly slow, some places are dirty, etc.  What got me at this one was that the person making the sandwich put the lid for one of the food troughs on top of the plastic that separates the food from the customer, and it slid off and landed on the floor where customers walk in.  On my way out I picked it up and handed it to the person and she PUT IT RIGHT ON THE FOOD!  I will not be returning to this Subway."}
{"text":"Great service. I walked in and was immediately welcomed. They were very focused on getting me through the line as fast as possible and everyone was very friendly. As I sat and ate, I saw lots of friendly greetings and happy customers."}
{"text":"I love this subway!!! Everybody is funny and the place is very clean and well kept. Every time I go in there, theres always the same guy and he actually remembers my order every time, Sweeeeeeeeet ! The food is always fresh and even if they have a line out the door you never have to wait for very long because everybody that works there is fast and proficient. Customer for life."}
{"text":"This Subway is awesome. We go here quite often since it is down the street from our church, and we have never had an issue. Also, this is the only location that I have ever saw the seafood sensation sub. Which is kinda sad because I absolutely love it!  They are always fast and accurate at making the food and friendly. Definitely a good option if you want a bite to eat and are in a hurry."}
{"text":"How many Subway employees does it take to make a sandwich? 

In the mail this month we received an entire page full of the same Subway coupon: buy one 6 \" sub plus any drink, get one 6\" sub free. Basically this equates to a whole month's worth of buy one get one free eating, so how could we resist?

We were headed to an outdoor concert in the park and stopped in to pick up some healthy sandwiches. Our visit starts off by being cut off in the parking lot for a front-row-joe parking spot.. oh well I can always use the exercise... turns out the guy wasn't even going to Subway so I am not sure why he needed that exact spot. When we walked in there was guy #1 behind the counter helping a foreign couple with their order.  There was guy #2 sweeping the empty restaurant. We weren't greeted for a while because guy #1 behind the counter was overwhelmed trying to understand the order of the couple in front of us. They didn't speak English very well and had strange requests like adding an egg to their turkey sandwiches - but just one egg, split between two sandwiches.. he kept thinking they were trying to order an omelet. 

We didn't even realize there was a 3rd employee because he was hiding in the back, apparently too busy to come and help up. We weren't too upset about the wait, more humored by the strange order from the folks in front of us. Finally guy #1 behind the counter yells, \"Hey, what's your name?\" Guy #2 sweeping responds back with his name. Guy #1 then yells, \"You wanna come helps these two?\" To which guy #2 sweeping says, \"Yeah, just a sec.\" We wait while he finishes sweeping and then washes his hands. He comes around the counter apologizes for the wait and takes our order. But it's apparent he's new because he doesn't know the names of the sandwiches (didn't understand when I ordered a black forest ham and turkey) and gets confused about how much meat comes on it, etc. He has to ask the guy #3 in the back for assistance. It was quite the process! We finally get our sandwiches made and I hand over the coupon. Guy #1 tells me the sandwich and drink are both free, but gets confused entering the coupon and also has to ask guy #3 for help. Turns out the drink was not free, so we buy the drink, take our sandwiches and walk out shaking our heads at what a hassle it was.

I'm sure we'll be back to use another coupon this month, but I'll make sure it's not on a day that I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"Go here pretty often... have gotten a sandwich a few times and have always gotten good service. I usually get a coffee... because they have the different flavors of Seattle's Best K-cups. If you are a GCU student then you show your ID and get a discount. Definitely a pretty cool place and will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome. This has become my new fave 24 hour spot close to home. The guys who work there are very friendly, fast and efficient. I pulled up a few minutes ago with two cars ahead of me, and the line went so fast. As soon as I said my order he was ready for me to pull up. Tonight it was Jose, I have had him help me before as well as another Hispanic guy with glasses, each time I am uber impressed. 

With subway and most chains, unless the food quality is awful/old/cold you cant really review the food based on taste that is the taste that it is. For example, Dennys food is mediocre even when it is good, so you cant really take a star away for having mediocre food when thats just the way it is. I like Subway for what it is: Cheap easy food, with healthy options for a dieter (like me). I just wanted to put that out there for every chain that has reviews just based on food, and to let companies know that for some people (me) the service can take a mediocre meal to a great one. 

So thanks awesome subway dudes!"}
{"text":"In trying to find a cheap place for lunch today, I began browsing through coupons on retailmenot. I found one for a 6 inch sub for $2.99, and it seemed like a winner to me. I received a text from Subway with a link to the coupon code, and I clicked it, only to be taken to another screen that said not to click it until I am with a cashier. So, I headed to Subway. 

When I got there, there were two other customers getting ready to leave, and I was immediately greeted by the sandwich artists. It took them no time at all to come and ask for my order. There were three ladies working today. One was making sandwiches, one was running the cash register, and one was refilling the ice in the soda machine. They all seemed very friendly. 

The lady making my sandwich was very polite and did everything perfectly. She gave me a generous amount of veggies as well, which I certainly appreciated. When I got to the register, I explained that I had a strange coupon, and I was given the cashier's undivided attention when I clicked the button to activate my coupon. She explained to me that the reason a cashier needs to be present is because it times out after five minutes, and they need to see the countdown to ensure the coupon is still valid. 

At this point, I know I'm a terrible person, but I've been out of work due to an injury for a while, and I have to save money where I can. I apologized to the cashier as I handed her my payment (in the form of mainly quarters.) She assured me it was no problem at all, and continued to be extremely pleasant. The ladies then wished me a nice day as I left. 

I would definitely recommend them again."}
{"text":"So... I think I'm done with this subway. 

You know that $6 meal that Subway offers? You can't get it here. They will ALWAYS AUTOMATICALLY UPSELL you to a $6.10 meal with a bigger drink. They don't tell you, and you don't have any way to know until after you've paid and have your receipt."}
{"text":"The restaurant is always clean when I go in. The music they play is good for the atmosphere and enjoyable. The make table always looks good and they keep their veggies covered when not serving as they should. Taylor is usually who's working when I stop in on my way to work, she has a great attitude and good with customers."}

Visited on 10/7 Saturday night 3 AM, ordered a Philly cheesesteak 12 inch and was given 2 three-quarter full scoops of Philly steak (should have been 3 full scoops), when I politely confronted the server about the incorrect amount he responded he's doing what he was told is correct, the same thing happened with the amount of cheese.
I am very disappointed with this location I will not return."}
{"text":"Worst subway experience to date. 

Despite the other low reviews we decided to try out this location since we were in the area. The store itself looked to be clean but the service was absolutely horrendous. For starters, we weren't greeted by either of the employees at the counter. If you can't take the time out to acknowledge your customers, why even bother to be open for business? 

This is where the experience became irritating. Subways are known to be stingy with their product but this place takes the trophy. The woman placed both of the cheese triangles in the middle on top of each other when putting the sub into the toaster oven...too late to change that one. Each topping on the sub was such a minor amount, it was ridiculous. 4 slices of banana peppers and 3 olives... After the 3rd topping I had to ask for more. After the building of the sub I watched as the woman folded the sub a quarter of the way over and rolled it up. Speechless. 

We won't be back and I'll be letting other friends and family know of my horrible experience about this location as well."}
{"text":"Would not go here again rude ppl make sandwiches and get lost doing it sad drive somewhere else another subway"}
{"text":"Pay attention to the hours...the two teenagers that others have complained about...they darken the place down early to make it look like they're closed when they're actually open. We went there to eat on Monday July 6th at 9:00-9:15 in the evening and we had to go in and see if they were open or not. They were obviously pissed that they had to serve us 45 minutes before they closed. As we were eating an older gentleman came in at 9:50 and they told him they were closed and turned him away. We felt very uncomfortable with the service we received, the young guy and girl treated us like a nuisance...not a customer. You just lost my business and it won't be long with these two before this place is shut down. Good Luck!!"}
{"text":"Since at the end of the day this is still just a Subway, the max stars I'm willing to give it is 3.  That being said, this Subway does deserve 3 stars. The service is always good, I never have to wait more than a few minutes to order since they usually have 2-3 people working at all times, and it's open 24 hours which is pretty awesome for anyone that works in the gaming industry and gets off at odd hours.  There is parking right in front that never really fills up.  Overall, exactly what you want from a Subway."}
{"text":"What's up with the dry crusty bread?  Everything else was great, service, portion sizes, cleanliness, but then I bite into my bread and it's hard.  I'm also in a rush, don't really have time to go back, nor am I in the area enough to come back anyways. So ya..I guess I'll just chalk this one up to a loss.  Basically everything was great til I bit into the bread, so just keep an eye out and don't serve hard bread"}
{"text":"This is for the Subway at the Monte Carlo. 10.50 got a foot long BMT? You have to be kidding. Can't even get a glass of water. Terrible service and the bread tastes old. You guys should at least wear masks and carry guns if you're going to rob people."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. Every experience is like a horror movie. The staff are limited English speaking which isn't typically an issue, but when you have to point to each ingredient because they have no idea what you have said (four times) then it is time to do some employee development.  The food is always fresh, but this business will never last as long as customer service is this terrible.  As a side, being a person who speaks Spanish, it is not polite to cuss in Spanish and assume no one can understand you!  Completely rude!"}
{"text":"Dear Owner that assisted us this morning,

There is a calculator next to your register, I suggest you use it. 

You snapped at me because I said you charging me full price for the sandwich was dumb and we tried to tell you it would be cheaper to get the deal and the OJ. 

Well sir, let's do the math. 

$3.75 (full price) for the sandwich
$1.80 for the OJ
$0.51 tax
------------
$6.06 TOTAL

Now let's try it with the meal deal that would have gotten me a small pop with my sandwich and OJ. 

$3.00 Meal Deal
$1.80 OJ
$0.44 tax
------------
$5.24 TOTAL

So tell me how that isn't cheaper? If you are doing it to me you are doing it to everyone who comes in your store. Knock the SHIT OFF and learn some simple math."}

{"text":"I have been to this location twice in the past two weeks.

The first time the too cool for school teenager serving us looked at me blankly when I asked if the cheese was real.

The second time the server said \"yes\" when I asked if the cheese was real. LIES! There is a sticker on the sneeze shield that says \"NATURAL CHEDDAR\" with a tiny astrix leading to a line at the bottom that reads \"this is a processed product\". Subway you will feel the full wrath of my ire because I'm tired of misleading advertising.

Subway you may have succeeded in marketing your wares to the masses with your friendly boy-next-door actor \"Jared\" but you don't fool me. I'm done with you and your preservative laden, faux 'healthy' fast food."}
{"text":"Don't go here at night!! This is the second time I go here and the doors are locked. What's the point on being 24 hours if they are gonna close the doors? I pull on the door and try on getting the employees attention but they just look the other way not acknowledging that I am there."}
{"text":"Only two people working at 5:30pm. They are both pokie too.  I have time to write my review in line.  Aaaargh!

Seriously, it's a subway and the food is consistent and good and all that, but I was a little short on time and I don't remember the last time I've been in a Subway with only two workers during dinnertime.  That was bad enough, but these two moved in slow motion.  I guess they were savoring every piece of shredded lettuce they put on my sandwiches.  I would have yelled at them or reached over and poked them or something, but a wise man once told me not to jack with the people preparing my food.  Not really.  It's just common sense!"}
{"text":"This location review based off of experience on Thursday morning. Walked in and the store was clean and empty. I was actually only customer there. I was greeted promptly for my order. Within 5 min order was complete.  I ordered the cheese and egg omelet. Tasty pretty tasting but shocked at sticker price for sandwich.  Cost $7.50 for foot long and drink. 
Side note subway change the pee color branding (like booth seats) with something more updated. Just look yucky and dirty even when clean."}
{"text":"Not training their new staff at all. I just got out and I have never had a worse sandwich made before. The new guy was not being watched other than being reminded I needed cheese on my sub before toasting it. My sandwich was cut off center, and it literally fell apart in his hands because he was not shown how to close the sandwich properly. He could not wrap it tightly, and one end was hanging out. When handed to me in the bag, it looked like a messy heap bent  in \"half\" and my sandwich is leaking its innards.

Train your new staff. If I walk in and see the same guy working, I'm either asking a veteran maker to build my sub, or walking out."}
{"text":"So weird that there are no other reviews. So the other day I came here and there was a subway big wig checking in on the store and they didn't even have the best customer service and they were completely out of cookies!! Well except the leftover gingerbread ones from the day before when I was there too. 

I really wish they would put a trash near the soda machine so I have a place for my straw wrapper- and until they do, I will keep leaving it on the counter. 

I love how if you order a meal with a large drink it is $7 and the meal with the small drink is $6.... $1 more for having a big drink- I hate that!"}
{"text":"Most immature staff of any subway I have visited, EVER! Many occasions I have walked in and heard the manager, I assume, and employees talking about schedules, how much the job sucks and how bad other employees are. 

They rarely answer the phone when calling to ask a question about their menu and please please please ensure employees know the menu and what is available to the customer."}
{"text":"There are not enough banana peppers to go around.  We live in a world where banana pepper supplies are threatening.  YOU cannot have any banana peppers.  That other subway? Oh yea they probably have them.  But not ours.  That is a luxury.  Why do you need them?  When I was growing up, I had to walk up hill both ways to get banana peppers.  One does just ask for banana peppers.  There is a process.  You have to put in an application for banana peppers then have it reviewed by the banana pepper supply manager then if there's a question is has to get kicked to the VP in charge of Banana Pepper Management.

FYI sometimes they don't have banana peppers.

There's 1 halfway functioning person working.
The credit card machine takes 5 minutes.

It's probably easier to call Subway, set up your own franchise location, and order a sub with banana peppers than it is to get one here."}

{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I have NEVER felt so disrespected in my entire life. Full disclosure: My entire group was not drinking. We stayed at the Plaza Hotel, and needed to get some food for the road. A few of us decided to get subway. I was super excited when I saw that they had a vegetarian option for me. I was trying to ask the worker if the patty was good but she could care less about helping me. She informed me that \"that isn't her area\" so I asked her if i was able to try a tiny bit before ordering it. I was informed by Carmen Perez, who was working the register, that I couldn't. I was totally fine with that and completely understood. But I decided not to get anything, because it genuinely felt like they could care less about giving me service. My friends and boyfriend still got sandwiches. While they were filling up their sodas, we heard Carmen say that I was a \"F*** Bi**\". We turned around, in shock. My boyfriend and friends told her that she was rude and that her behavior is unacceptable. I asked for both workers names and informed them that I would be writing a review and calling corporate. Carmen continued to be blatantly rude (while helping a customer) and she was yelling that we are liars. I was so upset that I couldn't stop shaking. I wish that we would have brought our money and business elsewhere. I hope that if Subway cares about their customers, they will do something about this."}

{"text":"This is probably the worst Subway in Las Vegas. They are always out of bread. Today was even worst, they didn't have lettuce and tomatoes. Another customer asked for soup, they told her they didn't have it. The attitude of the employees is terrible. They don't acknowledge the customer. When it's time to order they just look up at you, and not even say anything. Last time I was in there they were arguing with each other. If your craving Subway just wait till you can go to a different one outside the mall. Save your money."}
{"text":"Super fresh !!  Super fast !!  
Having a daughter addicted to subway was a curse in the past, but now we love the location here next to Chandler High School.  Nick, the manager, manages a RUSH of high schoolers quickly, and everyone is friendly.  
They always remind you, or others that a free cookie come with add-ons.  Always clean stocked.  
My favorite Subway !!
Keep doing it right guys :)"}
{"text":"It's a typical Subway so I knew what to expect.  As always, friendly, knowledgable staff eager and ready to help.  I read some of the previous reviews on this location and I'm glad to see things have changed - at least the night I was there.  I would have had no issues walking right out if I experienced anything like what has been mentioned about this location.

I would return and if the experience is the same each time I would upgrade the stars."}
{"text":"The buying experience is great. Very kind, helpful, and fast! But I would NOT work here. The staff is actually great! This store's weakness is the manager Charles. Very lacking of communication and makes working there a headache more than a great learning experience."}
{"text":"LITERALY the best subway experience... all the employees soooooo nice!!!! For just coming to get a sandwich it was fun!"}
{"text":"Stopped tonight after a long hard day... had no produce options... onion was dry stale no olives or avocados ... peppers were submerged in goo and breads where limited to white and wheat... basically if you want to scrape the bottom of a trash bin outside, your odds would improve for variety and freshness. Luckily I had my own spinach and avocado at home - Eat fresh TRASH at this subway - have it their way and pay up for nothing. Never again."}
{"text":"Every time I go here they are super helpful, friendly, and fast serving. They always greet me and talk with me and my boyfriend while making our sandwiches. They offer opinions when we ask and are very honest. Every one should go out of there way to stop at this subway. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Initially I wanted to order soup, but I got caught off guard with the long line during the busy weekday lunch rush hour, so I ended up ordering a 6 inch sweet onion chicken teriyaki sub on Italian herbs & cheese bread with some lettuce, tomato, cucumber and green peppers. Upgraded it for $2.50 extra plus upgrade fee to get a bottled Lemon-Lime Gatorade and bag of Doritos Nacho chips. Total price of $7.90 for lunch. 

Standard Subway quality, although towards the end of my sandwich, something tasted a bit off. I noticed the lettuce did not look the freshest. The Doritos chips also tasted stale even though it was supposed to be fresh for at least another month. I now understand why I haven't rushed to try out this Subway. I may come back to try the soup some other day or when I feel like I'm craving a sub. However, given all the other options around the square, I'd say it doesn't hurt to keep searching."}
{"text":"I've been to this Subway about 5 times..

It's an average Subway, with average tasting/prepared sandwiches, and average service. Nothing jumps out in the service/taste department, but I also have never experienced any of the complaints from the other's reviews..

This is a 24 hour Subway. It's off Boulder Hwy, so once darkness sets in, this location is VERY shady and borderline unsafe. I highly recommend only coming here during daytime hours. The closer location off Lake Mead, is newer, cleaner, and safer, but NOT open 24 hours a day.

Finally, as dumb as this sounds, this location's menu is unreadable unless you're literally pressed against the glass counter. No idea why, but they put the main menu section on the SIDE wall instead of directly in back of the counter, like every other Subway I've ever seen. You can't read the prices or some of the names. They need to redo the display."}
{"text":"The sub was perfect can't really mess it up to much as you make it right in front of me, but I am a firm believe in great customer service and this location lacks that. Kinda like \"what do you want\" could be a \"hello what can I get you today\" or the end after I paid was the best \"bye\" when you can be polite and say \"have a nice day !\" Just need a little lesson from chick-Fil-a !"}
{"text":"This is the worst subway I've ever went to! Terrible customer service, every time you ask for extra it's a problem, doesn't take coupons, the manager compares his Subway to the strip. Never going there again. Advise you not to go!!!"}
{"text":"This place is never busy! and it's the closest to my place. So they had a 100+ order so they were busy all morning making subs till when we came in. The guy kept apologizing for the wait which we were totally ok with cause we were in no rush. Then he was done and greeted us. He was really friendly and we had a good convo. Surprisingly the employees get a lot of bad customers who \"flip him off\" or treat him wrong while he's just trynna do his job. But anyway We got good service and good subs thumbs up. 4 stars cause owner is rude didn't say hi or greet us."}
{"text":"My former rating was a joke. There are some good people working here. Unfortunately, the one girl in there is almost impossible to deal with. A coworker was so offended today, she said she wanted to beat up the girl at Subway. If you really want to experience the worst customer service in Cleveland, go to this Subway. I really can't stand the girl who works there either. I think anyone who eats lunch here feels the same. They need to fire her."}
{"text":"Typical Subway, clean restrooms, nice employees. Hey, it's a Subway, what do you want?"}
{"text":"Typical Subway, fresh bread, meats and cheeses, tons of toppings. Busy in the morning as it's near the T station, the offices and The Bradford School in Station Square. Gets busy at lunch too for the same reason."}
{"text":"Very very slow service. If you are in a for quick lunch, please avoid this location. I think they should add more people and make the service fast. Other than that, it's great!"}
{"text":"Place was a mess guy helping had a shitty attitude not pleasant, bread stale, only one cookie with a meal no sorry should be 2 but it was busy I didn't wanna waste the time waiting I was on a quick lunch. CLEAN THE STORE HAVE MORE STAFF! Also have a better attitude and do your job better."}
{"text":"Showed up at 11:50 am and door is locked all lights on states 24 hours pretty bs and no number to call..."}
{"text":"Can't come here anymore. Manager just makes me uncomfortable. Obsessed with cleaning but place still messy. They're always hiring and it's always different people so I'm guessing the manager is OCD about things or very strict. The veggie area is messy sometimes like random veggies in other veggies. It gets super warm sometimes inside I wouldn't know if the meat on top is still cold or room temp but still gross. Pretty sure my stomach has gotten sick like that after that day not that I remember. Kind of silly adding locks to bathroom doors that they have to open it for you to use the bathroom like who has time to wait for them to finish making a sandwich to let you use the restroom? They did that to a paying customer and the old guy almost had an accident waiting to use the restroom. I've lived on this side of town for years and came to this Subway for quite some time. It's changed. Not going back anymore."}
{"text":"I have been stopping by this particular Subway for years now and have had nothing short of perfection everytime I walk in the door. The \"Sandwich Artists\" always greet me with a friendly smile and ask me how my day is going even when they are extremely busy. A lot of the time they will even ask me how my meal was when I am sitting in the lobby!!! This particular subway never fails to impress and is probably my favorite \"quick stop sandwich shop\" in the Vermillion county area. Clean, friendly, and fast!! This store deserves all 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Never a problem with this location. Staff is polite...service is fast...It is pretty much like any other Subway. Love it..."}
{"text":"I frequent this for lunch. Kosher and consistent.  Never get bad service or food that isn't typical  subway.  Fast service. Stable employees. Owner is personable. Great location in mall ."}
{"text":"Place was clean and presentable with everything stocked. Best of all there was a very nice lady working by herself at the counter around 9pm, was a pleasure to talk to you, thank you."}
{"text":"Watched the \"sandwich artist\" go through a tray of bread and throw 4 loaves away due to them being under cooked before selecting a loaf out of the same batch to make my sandwich.  Needless to say it was doughy and inedible. I ended up throwing the rest of my foot long away. Their prices are also $0.50-$1.00 more than the regular $5 foot long prices of other stores. Quality control does not seem to matter here."}
{"text":"Jared would be proud.  Turkey subs, wheat bread, healthy veggies, no condiments.  
I love the concept of Subway.  I wish there was more consistency among the locations.

The veggies at this location are usually fresh tasting.
The employees are always friendly and helpful, some appear to have been there for a long time, some are new.
There is an added benefit of this location sharing space with a donut shop.(sorry Jared, none for you.)
The breads are delicious.
The large subs for parties always taste great.

However, that said, there are several things hurting at this location. 
1) The meat other than the turkey always looks bad. Especially the roast beef which is a dark artificial looking brown.
2) They don't have the white chocolate Raspberry cookies.
3) They almost always mess up my order somehow causing delays.
4) They are kind of sloppy making sandwiches and I watched tuna fall into another bin and they didn't do anything about it while I was there.  It was not very busy at the time.  Today when I was there it was busier and they were scrambling to keep up but it seemed neater.
5) The chicken appears to have painted on grill marks.

Overall it is a decent, healthier alternative to lunch and September is Subtember $5.00 footlongs so it is a value!."}
{"text":"My 7 year old thinks this place is the bomb.  However, I beg to differ.  Their slogan is eat fresh but I look through the glass at the fixins and wonder if Fresh is the right word.  Not to mention their cold cuts look like they have more fillers and preservatives than actual meat.

Some things are good as they do have a lot of choices but I would stay away from the limp bacon or chicken sandwiches.  In a pinch this is edible but there are many better sandwich shops to choose from in the area.  For kids, the \"fit meal\" works well and comes with a little subway bag.  Chip and drink choices are limited but they have great cookies. Try the white chocolate raspberry!"}
{"text":"As far as Subway's go, this one is better than most than I have been to. I frequent this Subway quite often as it is the closest Subway to my office. The candor from the \"sandwich artists\" is always refreshing. You can tell most of them actually enjoy their jobs. Once I found a piece of plastic in my sandwich. You know when you open a bag of turkey and the edges of the bag are all tough to break open? A sliver of that ended up in my sandwich. The manager was quick to act and ended up making it a non-issue for me. I appreciated how he took charge and took care of it. Just another reason why I go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this location quite a lot as it's fast and really close to home. Good points: like I said already, it's fast and the employees are generally really good. My major complaint here is that nearly every time we come here lately (it's generally around 5pm) they're out of items. Usually the items they're out of are cheese, provolone typically, spinach among others. Now to me this seems like the owner is being a little too cheap for a fairly busy location. It really needs to be well stocked and they're just not :("}
{"text":"My fiancé & I were looking for something quick to eat & Subway sounded good. I looked it up & my GPS sent us here. After passing the turn, we asked a lady walking to her car where the Subway was & she told us it was just the next street over but warned that it was \"not a good one\" & \"it's really bad\". We thanked her but after discussing it, we decided she probably had a bad experience. 
We were wrong. 
Upon walking up we noticed one worker walking out the front door with the trash. Inside there was one other girl standing around at the counter. While making our subs she had to stop NUMEROUS times to go to the back to get toppings that had run out. She had to get more steak, cheese, lettuce, mayo, salt and pepper!!! This was around 6pm. 
The other girl, that was taking trash out, peeked around the corner from the back while putting new trash bags in a can. She didn't offer to help or think to begin restocking the table. We didn't see her again.
It took WAY to long for her to make our subs bc of being unprepared."}
{"text":"They charged me 2.19 for a large cup of water after I purchased food. This place is horrible don't go here"}
{"text":"This subway is in the hotel of the Plaza

24 hour subway and better than the other gross subway that's located on Fremont.

Come to this one.
I've been coming here for 11 years.

After a long day of walking / gambling, this is some great comfort food and the customer service has always been great to me. 

Hopefully this review doesn't jinx it LOL"}
{"text":"I love subway, but for the first time ever I got food poisoning from them. My boyfriend and I got two sandwich his the spicy Italian,  mine the cold cut combo, both footlongs the bologna tasted funny didnt think anything of it never had it before. Then all of a sudden after 330am I wake up to my stomach hurting, i try to let it pass then about 4am my stomach was like screw this, and I had to run to the bathroom and I end up puking it up. Let just say for the first time ever I don't think I will have subway for a while now."}
{"text":"HEALTH CONCERN** 
Terrible drive thru service! Sitting for nearly 10 minutes without anyone even acknowledging me. Upon pulling up to the window I noticed the kid making my sandwich had open acne sores covering his entire face ! This is against health regulations, not to mention just disgusting."}
{"text":"I went to this subway location on a Monday morning around 11:45am.  I ordered a veggie sandwich on an Italian roll to go.  When I reached my destination and took the sandwich out it was obvious that this was NOT fresh bread.  It tasted old and soggy not crisp like freshly made bread.  What a total letdown.  Someone is trying to cut corners by serving old bread.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I quite frequent this Subway location, i never really had any problems with this business or its staff, the little Indian girl is quite pleasant and sweet. Altough the consistancy of the subs vary. Freshness is always fresh at least when I order. They don't always have the bread you want though which is quite annoying. I guess i am the few that gets lucky with this Subways."}
{"text":"Horrible.  What's the point of a drive thru if no is working the drive thru.  Waited forever.  They need people at the front part AND the drive thru. The whole drive thru is pointless.  Never coming back to this one"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but...

I've never had such a sandwich (the Italian BMT with all of the trimmings,my favorite) from a Subway that was so bland and disappointing.... I couldn't even finish my sandwich, which was pretty bad considering how hungry I was."}
{"text":"New location, very clean, fast friendly service! Perfect for a quick grab and go lunch."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Subway in Toronto. It even makes the TTC look good!

The people working here are downright rude and mean. Not only that, but they will always screw up your order! Ask for parmesan oregano and you might just get plain white bread. Swiss and cheddar are interchangeable as well. Oh and they skimp on ingredients.

Still, this place manages to stay packed all the time because of flood of new UofT students ever year who don't know of all the food options in the area."}
{"text":"Whenever i am in a mood of lite and  healthy food, Subway is always my foremost choice.

Recently i ordered Grilled Chicken Sub with Honey Mustard and chipotle sauce. It was delicious and healthy at the same time. I usually avoid mayo as it contains more fat and betray your purpose of eating healthy food.

Rating:
Ambience: 3/5
Taste:4/5
Quality: 4/5
Value for money: 4/5

Other revommendations: Chicken teriyaki sun with same combination of sauces also tastes amazing"}
{"text":"Just okay. It's a Subway. 

The restaurant wasn't the cleanest but it wasn't filthy. Staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"This is one old Subway.  It looks exactly the way it did when it first opened, even the same silk plants hanging from the ceiling (It reminded me of Three's Company).

This place was almost like a dance club-- the music was so loud that I was screaming my order and the people putting the toppings could barely hear me and I could barely hear them.....  Try mouthing \"banana peppers\" and you look like a tool.  It was pretty funny though, we left with our plastic bags and subs in tow cracking up at the whole experience. 

One thing that bothered me was that as I was ordering my toppings, I couldn't see the ingredients.... I like seeing the ingredients to help me choose what I want on the sandwich.  I felt like I was 4 foot, I could barely see over the ledge.... what does someone who is short do?  I'm 5'6 (and a half) and I had a hard time. 

It's convenient for the downtown lunch bunch.  I will return.  The staff was upbeat and smiley, I am sure the music was keeping them in high spirits.  The bread wasn't as fresh as it has been in the past, but maybe it was just an off day?  We'll see!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best subway sandwich I've ever had! I got the same thing as always but it was just so dang good! 

Staff was extremely friendly, fast and efficient. The store was , The location is good right by a Target and plenty of other food choices. And the food was really really good honestly.

The bread was really fresh, my veggies were fresh it was all just such a good experience."}
{"text":"I came in today to get a gift card as a Christmas gift, while I was here I ordered two six inch turkey sandwiches. Upon being checked out by Gabi, I requested a gift card. She very sharply said gift cards are now only being sold with cash purchase. I said I only have my debit card, why is that? She stated that there has been too much fraud and then sent me across the street to Walgreens to purchase a Subway gift card...while saying this to me, another employee walked up and said, that's not true. :-/  Gabi turned back to me and said, that's the owners rules. Hummmm well, I certainly won't be going to another store to get a gift card to a store that I'm currently standing in. Looks like I won't be giving a Subway gift card, for Christmas, or ever going forward."}
{"text":"I waited in line for about 5 minutes while they were just talking. Finally took my order and the lady didn't understand the difference between the cheeses. 
Me: \"can I have Cheddar?
Her: \"this one\"
Me: \" I just want cheddar.. is that cheddar?\"
Her: \"no\"
Me: \"well what is that?\"
Her: \"American\"
Me: \".. that's fine..\"

Then I say I want a little bit of lettuce and onions. She gives me 2 pieces of onions and a handful of lettuce. You cannot even tell that there was a sandwich under there. 
I finally just order 2 meals and she gives us one meal and charges us for another soda and cookie. 
Then she goes right to talking to this guy. 
I used to love this place.."}

Customer service is bad 
Didn't offer to toast my bread 
Put to much sauce and messed up my sandwich 
Don't go here they are lazy, and a bunch of jokes"}

{"text":"I must say I was surprised that Phoenix Subway beats any other Subway in the Medford area! I have been avoiding Subway for a while now due to all my food poisoning encounters from their food not being cold enough and left out! But their food was definitely cold! You could see the frost around the trays! I never got sick either! They also had by far the friendliest customer service I have ever seen in any subway and did a great job making our subs! They piled the toppings high too! ;) Real nice and clean Subway. Smaller since in a small town but not even noticeabley smaller. So glad that this will be my new Subway I frequent since I just moved to Phoenix! ;D The best part is THEY HAVE A DRIVE THRU!!!!!!! This means the world to me since I am disabled and can't stand in lines without being in agony! :D"}
{"text":"Another late night at work and needed to hit up the vet next door for puppy meds, thought a quick 'healthy option' sounded perfect. Walked in only person in here, Giovanni appeared at the order counter as I approached it and promptly greeted me with the usual pleasantries. Ordered my BMT with bacon ( I did out healthy option, in quotes...everything is better with BACON! ) Asked if I wanted it toasted or just the bacon, most places scoff when I ask for that separate or heaven forbid u ask for the bread to be roasted before you add anything to it to avoid soggy bread.  My sandwich was dressed and prepared just the way I like it and I already had grabbed a drink Giovanni suggested if I'd like q cookie it was part of the $5 special even though I had initially said I just wanted the drink. Well who doesn't like savings and a cookie?!? 
As I walked out of the store I thought this could have easily been the most pleasant visit to a subway well since ever. When I clicked on Yelp so I could leave a review I was shocked to see low stars...to be honest I didn't even read any reviews I'll be back next puppy med refill for sure:)"}
{"text":"With all due respect Cailen S, yous crazy. Just because the owners of this Subway wrangled some lunatic willing to stay up past midnight to make sandwiches (and screw it, some nights I would), doesn't mean they are some kind of gift to the people's of Oakville. 

This Subway isn't bad, but I would like to offer a stark counterpoint to the glowing recommendation proffered here. Yes, it might be true that you will wait a long time for your sub, and it's probably true that the sandwich artist -- who is kindof, sortof, but not really gifted in the breadmeat arts -- only speaks four words of English, it's most definitely true that they will rush to slam the ingredients on your submarine and put on way too much mayo when you only request one stripe of mayo. Why did you make two motions? Isn't that two stripes? One stripe, one motion. 

Yeah, yeah, they're open late. But so is Tim Horton's in the same plaza. Are they five stars too, Cailen? ARE THEY? No further questions, your honour.

Obligatory Title Pun: EAT FRESH, Cailen S.

Menu Readability: You know, it's a Subway.

Need to mention: Cailen and I go way back, hence I can question his judgment on Yelp.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm a dick."}
{"text":"It's Subway, you either love it or hate it. Depending on my food craving I am both. 

I love that this location is so close to my house and can easily pick up dinner on the way home. I have never had a problem with how they make the sandwich or the taste. It is very clean and never super busy so I can get in and out fast. Which is something I need if I am that close to home."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed. I ordered a 6 in on wheat tuna and no cheese just veggies. He didn't skimp on the veggies, I didn't have to keep saying can I have more can you add more. I'm sure subway employees are trained on how much to put on each sandwich but I was a happy satisfied customer so thank you to the young man who was making the sandwiches and ringing up (he removed his gloves) by his self. I'd go back even though I don't live in Charlotte just to know I'm not going to get 4 olives and 3 pickles on my sandwich. A happy customer I'm sure is more worth then the pennies of not skimping on the veggies cost. I ate my sandwich satisfied."}
{"text":"I come to this Subway from time to time. It's around the back (behind Bank of America) in the Albertson's shopping center. The employees are friendly and courteous & the place is always clean. Sandwiches, of course, are Subway standard and not sub-standard when you look at caloric content.

Great if you want the healthier of the fast foods on the way to Lake Pleasant or Ben Avery or wherever your destination may be."}
{"text":"I like Subway. I've been ordering the exact same veggie sub for almost 20 years. This location isn't anything special, but the kids that work there are always super nice. 

Oh and they have this super delicious brewed honey green tea! My new favorite drink!"}
{"text":"Seriously.... are you really COMPLETELY out of cookies?!  And did you just look at me like I'm crazy when I asked you are there any more being baked?! UGH!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that their customer service is TERRIBLE! Don't even bother ordering online because when you get here it won't be ready anyway and they will act like you are inconveniencing them. Not to mention that the young lady by the name of Andrea that works there is a ball of attitude and it shows on her face every time you walk in and she is there. For one she will not greet you at all. Second, she will have her resting bitch face ready to throw your way if you DARE ask for more condiments and lastly she will put SO much salt & pepper and oil and vinegar that you will immediately get high blood pressure while eating your soggy ass sandwich!!! They need to do some SERIOUS employee clean outs because this used to be an AMAZING location!!"}
{"text":"This is Subway is the cleanest and best I've been to.  The young lady manager (whose mom works there) keeps that place in tip-top shape.  The veggies are always fresh, and the bread never stale.  She keeps the counter neat and CLEAN.  Until I visited this location, I did not know the food counter could be closed.  Never before, at any Subway, have I seen it closed when not in use.  The friendly customer service and the cleanliness gives this sandwich shop 5 gold stars."}
{"text":"Been there twice.  First time, it was great service from two young ladies. Second time it was a young lady and a young man.  The young man seemed to have a sour temperament which would be understandable because sometimes days are bad, customers are jerks, etc., but he handled cash and then the veggies on my sandwich.  I can look past how they open the oven with their gloves and then the sandwiches, but I cannot overlook cash register contamination with my sandwich.  This Subway needs to better train in the process of food handling."}
{"text":"They're alright. I mean, the point is you come to this location to get a sandwich between classes or else, why come here?

My sandwiches turn out fine in terms of taste. The construction of my sandwich is always questionable because of this Asian guy who seems like he has a hard time when he is working, which he is. I noticed he was there for about a year now, but it does not seem like he got better. My sandwiches are always overstuffed or they are falling apart when I eat it! Make sure to specify how much dressing or sauce you want or else you're sandwich will be drenched in it."}
{"text":"Completely remodeled inside in the last few weeks. Still has the odd way that you have to line up to order, and the same staff. It just looks newer/cleaner.

And its still just Subway."}
{"text":"I don't mind Subway. I prefer to eat at more local places than chains, but I usually will enjoy subway sandwiches. However, this location has been very disappointing. I got old veggies once, my roommate got slimy meat once, and when I went back to give them another chance, they almost messed up my order three times. I will still eat at subway, but not this one. Even though it's the closest to my apartment."}
{"text":"The caviar here is just to DIE for.  What did you expect me to say?  It's Subway.  They're in every small town from Bay Roberts, NL to Fernie, BC.

This one was fast, clean and efficient.  That's all I ask for.  Staff was reasonably friendly and my sangie was tasty.  I have no idea how the pricing works at Subway though.  All you hear on TV are those god damn FIVE DOLLAR FOOTLONG commercials yet I just paid 6 something for a 6\" turkey with bacon.  WTF?  I don't know. I'll be back.  Weeee"}
{"text":"The owner is the worst. I'm a poor college student so I'm in here tryna get the basics. This stupid chick was pushing every extra cost she could on me. She was trying to get me to buy extra meat, extra cheese, avocado , etc. and she never mentioned that it costed extra I just knew because I've been to subway. After rejecting like 4 offers , she stopped looking me in the eyes and was just angrily throwing shit on my sandwich and I was like whoah chill! In the end , when I said I didn't want chips and a drink she just walked away and didn't hand me my sandwich and so I just reached over the counter and grabbed it. I am not rating cleanliness, samdwhich taste, organization. This is just my rating on the costumer service and my
Experience."}
{"text":"This is a good clean subway. Workers are always nice and friendly and there to help u right away and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Pretty same subs as every other location except they charge $2-3 more for the same thing. The staff was pretty stingy with the vegetables too. Save your money and drive 5 minutes to the mineral point location."}
{"text":"It was fine, but not memorable. 

I stopped for a quick lunch recently and left with a fulfilling sandwich. I got the veggie patty and added the sweet onion sauce (which is a great topping that isn't high in calories) and it was pretty tasty!

The sandwich artist adding tomatoes and pickles to my sandwich was a bit stingy and I had to ask for those topping a few extra times, but otherwise everyone was friendly.

Why don't they offer avocado anymore?

They have a fun little bell at the register that you should ring if you received great service!

Parking is especially tricky during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"This place is adequate but Subway as a whole is way too expensive for what they actually are. This store is always clean but they do have problems with keeping their veggies separated in the containers so you might end up with a straggler here or there"}
{"text":"Good service and sandwich, but the cost is ridiculous. I paid $11 for one foot long chicken breast by itself, no chips, drink, cookie included. That's a rip off. I came here from Arizona to visit las Vegas, and in AZ I pay $4 less. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Reviews are really subjective because one reviewers bad experience with someone might be totally different from my experience at the same place dealing with a different employee, but in case the previous reviews are (right on the ball) this place is a real hidden gem. Impossible to find without GPS because of the fast moving street that it is located on ( DeanMartin). I tried coming last night but could not find it because once GPS says (your here) you have passed it. It's in a one of those type of strip malls more like that, where u would find mechanics and aoto repair places. It's the very first unit therefore when you have located the address and look to your right you have already passed it. Nothing but locals seem to have been walking in that know the employees. This subway is super clean, awesome staff and this is the subway nearest you if you are staying at the RIO Hotel."}
{"text":"Dont go but if u do dont expect the sandwich to b like the pictures.  I  ordered a 6\" egg and cheese. Iasked for spinach got 3 leaves. Tomatoes 2  slices 2 small pepper strips and 2 small onion slices.  When I asked for extra  I was told that this is how we are taught.  There is a better one down the road on pecos and Tropicana."}
{"text":"Not impressed with online ordering from this location!  While online you can't change or add a pick up time, nor is there a place for extra notes (example: dressing on the side). I placed my online order & immediately called the store.   No answer, call again, no answer.   Wait a few minutes, call again.  No answer.  I checked the phone number, it's correct.  I call again.  I switch phones thinking maybe they don't answer blocked numbers.  No answer.   I tried approximately 25 minutes!   I wanted to tell them not to make my sandwiches now, wait 45 minutes!   Had they answered the phone, they would have known.  I get there & advise them, your phone is broke or disconnected.  To my surprise I got \"we were busy\" we couldn't answer the phone.   Really now?    Then the employee tells me, I did hold off on making you sandwiches a few minutes.  ??? How would you know, you never answered the phone!  So, with 2 sandwiches made, I was out the door.  Were they  fresh?  NO!!!  Why?!  They sat over 30+ minutes!    
So if this store can't be bothered by answering a phone for 25 minutes, I can't be bothered by going back."}
{"text":"Came here Monday around 7pm and asked for soup and was told it's the morning shifts job to make it and they didn't so there wasn't any. Came back Thursday at 11am and asked for soup and was told it'd take about 15mins to make. Keep in mind I was the only customer and the manager was too busy making her own sandwich. Staff always looks like they hate their job and sometimes there's no one around. There's another subway down the st. I'll be going to now on. Warning."}
{"text":"Here to get my pick up order at the moment it was scheduled for 9:26 and it's 9:27 and they have not even started making the sandwich I'm the only person in he"}
{"text":"I give y'all two stars whoever works and the day shift around 11am does not know how to make a damn sandwich gave me old dry ass bread pissed af never again didn't even add my pepperoni on, and charged me for it ! Dumb fucks !!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard Subway.  Nothing extraordianary here.  It does seem a bit smaller than average though (That's what she said)."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Subway.  Dining tables leave something to be desired though."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other review- the people who work here are just weird.  I mean, I'm sure it's hit or miss but my most recent experience the lady behind the counter was quite rude.  For as long as Subway has had more than white/wheat bread, they maintained  a list on menu of the different kinds of breads.  When I went in there yesterday, that list was gone for some reason.  Not having been in Subway in a while, I asked what kind of breads they had.  The lady muttered something than turned away.  Ummm.. okay, white bread it is I guess. They get one star for having edible food and one star for having it cost $5.  Two stars. 0 stars for service."}
{"text":"Mad the mistake of stopping here around breakfast time. Extremely slow service with only one server making a  series of breakfast sandwiches holding up the line for the rest. Took almost 30 minutes to be served and then it was a challenge to communicate with the server explaining that I wanted the sandwich without cheese on one side and toasted.

Humongous waste of time that I will not repeat."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after dropping a friend off to the airport. Standard quality and service without any fuss so nothing more worthwhile to report."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Subway a lot, this location only a few times. The reason for my low review score is a lack of knowledge by the employees.

My wife went to get us sandwiches for a lazy diner after a long day. I asked her to get me the \"new special\" Reuben, toasted. I should have been more specific...

If you have ever had a Reuben you know that it is 5 ingredients that come together to make a glorious, tasty meal.

The sandwich artist asked what what kind of bread? Not a good sign. My wife says, \"whatever it comes with\". I will cut to the chase and say they got the meat and sauce right. I got every topping available, American cheese and white bread with mine. If you don't know how to make a Reuben, don't offer it."}
{"text":"When you're still on east coast time and you're up super early, there aren't many options for breakfast.

Have no fear...this subway is open 24/7.  I had a bacon, egg and cheese flatbread.  It wasn't that good, but I ate it.  Coffee was tasty.

The guy working was super friendly so I figured I'd up the stars for that.  I'm sure if you got a regular sub it would be okay."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Subway.  when I want a healthy, affordable lunch and I am on the run, I choose this location.  Matt practically remembers your order.  It is clean, efficient and the owner and employees always friendly!"}
{"text":"I go to this location quite often and rarely do I have a perfect experience. People who work there have attitude and never care to please the customer. I work in customer service and the customer isn't always right...but the people here never even try to make your experience good. Also the new app sucks! There was no where to select toasted or the bread type."}
{"text":"This Subway is so clean and the staff is so courteous and friendly. They also get me in and out fast. The sandwiches are always so fresh. I've also been there for breakfast. When I'm not in a hurry, and have time between appointments, I will eat in their dining room, and take my laptop in. They have free wifi and welcomed me to stick around, even after I was done eating, until my next appointment time, using their wifi. The manager even approached my table and asked if she could refill my drink for me! I also occasionally get to see my favorite afternoon shows on their large tv when I dine in. And the air conditioning is really nice and cool!"}
{"text":"I would agree with  the other reviewer - I wouldn't normally write a review for a quick-food chain restaurant, but...with this location literally being blocks from another location (that's closer to our home), we would MUCH rather come here!

In comparing this Subway location to many others we have been to, especially the other on Thunderbird and 19th, this one needs some recognition. The service is much more friendly, they have a little more pep in their step in making those sandos and getting through a line, and they don't skimp on toppings. Seriously!?! I don't know, I remember back in the day Subway sandwiches used to be full and healthy looking and some of these 'artists' add so little toppings it's almost insulting. \"Do you think I can't handle more than 5 olive slices on my footlong?\" 

We have seen a few employees here that do seem to go above and beyond with the friendly and personality side of the service, and it is appreciated. 

***We just wish you guys did the text message deals like the Thunderbird & 19th location so we didn't ever have to go there again."}
{"text":"The guy at the counter was nice but slow as 
Molasses!!! It took him an hour to make us 5 simple sandwiches!!! Not complex sandwiches, sandwiches right off the menu!!! He failed to give us napkins and had to swipe my debit card 7 times!!! This is THE WORST Subway's experience I have ever had. And I eat at subway twice a week! 
Lewis should be retrained or be let go."}
{"text":"I like coming here with my kids because it's usually pretty quiet-never packed and never had an issue, Until this particular visit. The two employees are having a very loud colorful conversation and every other word is f**k by this girl, to be followed by \"I gotta go smoke\" while I'm glad they wear gloves to make sandwiches.... Come on, I have young kids here. Thankfully it stopped as I was about to get up. Haven't seen these particular employees before tonight. Don't think I'll be bringing them back here again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Food was good and wait wasn't long. Portions were a little low but didn't really bother me. Place is clean and service was great."}
{"text":"I'm not a subway fan. But I can say everything was fresh and the store was clean. The stations was clean. Service was very nice. My sons love Subway I love cleanliness and this place passes the test."}
{"text":"Service is always terrible here.  They never smile. Always seem miserable.  Barely speak up.  They always short change me on my meats specifically the meat ball sub.  6 meatballs for a foot long ....... I have stopped going to this place and am going out of my way to go to another subway."}
{"text":"I like my cheap food even cheaper so I wait for the junk mail and lo and behold COUPONS FOR SUBWAY! 
I love that I customize my sammie just the way I like it. Pro tip: I usually get my lunch and dinner at the same time before work -a foot long. So I get the sandwiches made with different ingredients so I feel like I had two completely different meals for the day. Different cheeses for example and one with sweet onion one with mayonnaise etc.
I'm glad my sandwich artist never gives me a hard time with my order when I ask for one of the veggie patties not heated so I can heat it up later for dinner. Perfect!
I've never had an issue at this location but my only complaint is SMELLING like subway for hours after I've only been inside for 5 minutes. Lol. :P"}
{"text":"I know, it's a Subway, what am I doing with my life reviewing it. There are a million of them. However, today I went in for lunch and the woman working the counter was so friendly, nice and patient! I ate in the store and heard her interact with many more customers. She's a delight. If you can't decide between the four Subways all around this block, pick this one. 

Yum!"}
{"text":"This Subway is just a few blocks from my house. It isn't much different than any other franchise. I had a coupon for a buy one get one free deal. When I got there I was the only one in line. Both girls working there assembled my sandwiches. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. Jimmy John's isn't the only one who's freaky fast."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for buy one get one free. I was in the neighborhood, so I stopped in. This is an average Subway. restrooms were clean, food was good, service was fast, and with the coupon the price was great. I tried the limited time pulled pork sub. It was a real good sub, one I think that they should keep."}
{"text":"My family was over the other night helping me with a cake order. We started getting hungry but weren't quite finished the cake. We checked online what time the subway closed and it said 1 am. It was only 9:30pm so we were Golden (so I thought). We finished the cake and clean up around 10:45pm and decided to make the walk across the street to grab some grub. 

We we arrived we noticed it was empty so I thought \"great\" nice and quick service.. We received far from that. Their was a special going on for 4 subs with 12 cookies or soup. We decided to order that since there were 4 of us. The lady behind the counter looked at us like we weren't speaking English. We pointed to the sign and she looked up at it then back at us with this blank stare. She didn't moved,ask what we wanted? or say anything for that matter. She just kept shaking her head as if she didn't know what we were saying. Finally the guy came over and took our order have a great deal of explaining on our part. The couple both seemed frustrated with us.

The order process took over 15 minutes to get what we wanted. At first the guy didn't give us the correct amount of cookies or napkins and by asking him for it we felt we were bugging him. As soon as we sat down (closer to 11:30pm at this point) and took our first bite he spoke to us in a very stern voice \"Please hurry we need to clean\" \"You going to be quick?\" We all looked puzzled then my sister asked \"What time do you close\" He said \"1 am but it takes long to clean the tables and the floors. 

Personally I feel they were trying to kick us out to close shop early considering his young son was hanging around and looked exhausted. Being in customer services over 14 years of my life. This was UNACCEPTABLE!!"}
{"text":"I frequent this Subway when in the  East Valley.  I particulary enjoy the breakfest wheat flatbread with eggwhites, your choice of cheese and meat. Coffee is good and quality of product and cleanliness have always been excellent.  You really can't beat the price and convienence if looking for a healthy breakfast. Donna and her team do a very good job in providing excellent customer service. This is also my go to place for gift cards."}
{"text":"The food is decent. The service pretty much sucks. 

The whole time I was ordering two sandwiches the server acted as if she was impatient and was going out of her way to build my order. She could have at least tried to show some level of interest."}
{"text":"This Subway moved from around the corner (behind the McDonalds) to the location that used to be Starbucks.  It's a decent sized store, with plenty of parking, although the lot keeps pretty busy.

Staff is friendly enough.  It's a typical Subway - you order and add your veggies, they wrap it up and you are on your way.  They also sell chips, cookies and soup, in addition to sandwiches, flatizzas (their take on pizza) and drinks.

Nothing particularly special about this location.  Also nothing horrible.  Best thing: it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Only 1 person on staff a big guy by the name Daniel, and apparently he forgot to make the bread. So instead of taking my order he  sprinkles cheese onto 24 loaves of bread while casually asking if I knew what my order was, of course I know what my order is I'm in subway. So after 10 minutes of being the only person in line I finally got my sandwich. Then I ask if the ice tea is unsweetened to which his reply was \"I'm not sure\" I point out the fact that the label says unsweetened but he still stands by his statement.  The sandwich turned out fine and the tea was unsweetened but geez I would hate to be here when it is busy"}
{"text":"This is for the Subway located at 8776 E. Shea Blvd, Scottsdale. Decided on Subway because, while it is not fancy gourmet dining,has good value, fresh ingredients, and was close to our hotel. We were not disappointed. Got a couple of Autumn Carved Turkey subs, potato chips and we were good to go."}
{"text":"Oh that's just a great place to grab a sandwich when you're hungry  . Typical Subway, just mainly that \" cityside \" crowd in for lunch"}
{"text":"This subway always delivers great service. The staff are always welcoming. Definitely a great management staff as well."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the only Subway's that I will ever order from.
The staff working currently is friendly and always fast. The place is usually clean and they totally have a guy working at the register who looks like Michael Cera... But more gangster. LOL

I've never really had any complaints about my sandwiches, just wished they wouldn't be so stingy with the southwest sauce. That's usually on and off, some workers will smother my sub and others will give just enough to make the sandwich okay.

I've been here a couple dozen times already and eating here doesn't make me feel like a fatty."}
{"text":"The food here is OK. Definitely not great though. LOL. The service was quick and the restaurant is clean so I would definitely go back, it just wouldn't be my number one choice."}
{"text":"Do not come here at 11:30pm because apparently the guy working there on 6/20/18 said they only take cash and when I asked him who the managers name was, he got angry at me. He said to come back between 2a-4a for credit card services."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this Subway location as it was 24 hours and we wanted to grab a late night bite.  In the middle of ordering and making the sandwich, the associate told us that our sandwiches cannot be toasted as the oven is shut off which was not a big deal but thought that he should have informed us about it prior to ordering.  Afterwards when we were about to pay for our two sandwiches and a drink, I pulled out a coupon (buy 1 footlong sub with any drink, get another footlong for 99cents) and gave it to him.  He started arguing that we could not use the coupon which made no sense (I used another same coupon a day ago at this location) and started becoming arrogant towards us.  I was appalled by the lack of customer service this location offered.  Needless to say I'll be sticking towards the O'connor and St. Clair Ave East location for my Subway midnight run from now on."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the staff is inconsistent. Some of them are friendly, but others are rude and/or completely clueless about their menu. I have been in there a few times and one staff member always makes fun of my plain sandwiches. Yes, I know I am a picky eater, but I am paying for the food, so why does it matter?"}
{"text":"Honestly the only reason I even come to this subway is because corner bakery closes earlier than they say. This subway always makes my sandwiches look as unappealing as possible even when there isn't a line."}
{"text":"I suppose you can't really expect much from employees that they hire - it's kind of my pet-peeve to hear at least a \"Thank you\" when I pay for the food in restaurants.  Today, I ordered my tuna sandwich (which was delicious) and made it a meal - the young lady at the register was friendly but did not say \"thank you\" - but when I said thanks when she handed me the receipt, she says \"You're very welcome\". I don't know if I'm just old fashioned, but isn't it usually the other way around?  while I ate, I was waiting for the next customer to pay, to see if she says thank you to just certain people but she didn't. I didn't stay long enough to see if that was just how she is... This happens a lot, lately, that younger generation doesn't know the basic business manners?  I'll keep going there to eat, because it is fast, good, and inexpensive for lunch, and because there isn't another sub place I like near my work.  I'll give them 4 stars only for the quick service and decent sandwiches."}
{"text":"We've been to this subway a few times since it was across the street from my work office, so mainly because of convenience is why Ive been here a few times. The subs are normal subway sandwiches, however, I don't know if this is the norm here, but what is usually will pay about 6-7 dollar, they charged 9 bucks for the same sub i always get (double chicken breast on wheat). If I had a choice and if there were more food places nearby, I would most likely choose other place. However, I do know Subway has much more healthier food options."}
{"text":"Worst Subway restaurant in the area.  Came in today with my son and had a special request of no bread for my sons \"kids meal\" (he hates your bread).  The dumb cashier rang up the entire order (apples, milk, sandwich, etc) as an individual item and not as a kids meal and when I complained said she didn't really under English that well.  Every time I go to this restaurant something like this happens.  Also, never pay cash here I've caught the older Indian lady short changing me more than once.  This place isn't worth the hassle."}
{"text":"It's a Subway. I don't know what to say except that they were tidy and clean and my sandwich artist did a good job. Plenty of seating. Dessert is next door at Rita's and don't forget to stop into the used bookstore."}
{"text":"The sandwich artist who assembled my footlong turkey and provolone was polite, helpful and provided me with a well stuffed and properly assembled sandwich. The ingredients appeared fresh (other than the lettuce that needed a little help and some of the tomatoes in the stack had some core). She seemed a little disappointed that I did not want a \"combo\" and had a bottle of water I brought with me.

The restaurant was clean though one of the tables had some trash on it that was cleaned while I sat there.

Nice, helpful, good. Four stars."}
{"text":"I recently visited this subway location to grab quick lunch. When i arrived there was a employee helping a lady gather a salad, he seemed very irritated like he has had a long day and no further patience. When it was my turn, he still seemed frustrated, so I asked if i was a long day and if he was alone. He explained It was and he was alone, the manager left early. Management should defiantly not leave 1 employee to handle to whole store specially if it is busy. The employee did a great job of handling the store alone and not his fault management understaffed."}
{"text":"Management is always rude. Had a day old coupon and they wouldn't honor it. With all the money businesses spend on advertising you'd think they'd help people that visit them for repeat business. Sad business ethics and horrible customer service~ won't get my dollars. I'll spend my money where it's appreciated:-)"}
{"text":"One of the worst subway I've been to. 2 ladies working there is rude, service is slow, you can tell they don't get a long. It's our meeting place to pick up kids from school. They seemed to not like the kids then I'm sure we are a good part of their business."}
{"text":"Typically, I stop into this location to grab lunch for my daughter and I.  Then I have lunch with her at school.  She loves the kids meal but now that she is a growing girl, she prefers the regular 6\" sandwiches.  Since my visits are at just before lunchtime, I have not had to wait long for service.  The staff members are always kind and they do their job, which meets my requirements.  This location is open until 11 pm on weekends making it a good spot to drop in for a sandwich.  

Note:  Have $ or a cc on hand for the parking meters, if you can find one."}
{"text":"I like this Subway location.  It is always clean and the staff has been consistent for quite a long time.  They are quick in preparing the sandwiches and are somewhat patient when customers don't know what they want.  You may know my pet peeve, flies, I don't recall any problems while visiting this Subway.  I highly recommend this location for a health sandwich when you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is the very best experience I've had at any subway. If you want to know how to do it right, go there, watch, and be amazed. First, the friendliness is wonderful and refreshing! Usually am put off by the rush, rush assembly line atmosphere. Not so here. All the choices at each station are at eye level (not up high). The attendant made eye contact and explained when I was hesitant. He took time to make me feel welcome there! There was warmth in his manner. Was it Al? Well, thanks and to the owner (Sue, I think), thanks for such a great experience. BLT was delicious! You are a class act. I wish you continued success. Whoever comes into your place, I guarantee they will come back over and over again. No coupons or gimmicks needed, just good food, patience, and smiles. I'm hooked on Subway, but not just any Subway to be sure. Unless they take a refresher taught by you and you and Al."}
{"text":"Just NO! First off our subs that we wanted were out. Then both of our alternate orders were incorrect, we had to coach the staff on how to properly make simple subs such as an Italian BMT and buffalo chicken. Both were missing meat and cheese. C'mon really?!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, and the food was pretty good. I eat here at lease once every couple of weeks. The management is really good and has always helped when needed. I even brought in my daughter, and they waited patiently as she choose about one of everything possible."}
{"text":"Came here around 11pm looking for something quick and somewhat decent.  We grabbed 2 veggies.  The sandwiches are pretty solid the younger guy being trained who made ours packed them full.  Great staff, sketchy neighborhood."}
{"text":"Delicious food and top-notch service!  I was served by Heath, an impressive employee who treated me with respect and remained calm under the pressure of a demanding customer."}
{"text":"People there are friendly n very nice.. love going there my best subway in the area... proceso r kind of high.."}
{"text":"They have wraps on their menu now!  I just stopped in here to grab a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised to see wraps available.  I got the Turkey, Bacon & Guacamole wrap. They put all my favorite toppings on and they even grilled it in the panini press when I asked!  

The ladies here are very friendly too.  I definitely prefer this subway over the one on sil verado and maryland"}
{"text":"I have food restrictions and at every other subway I have been to no staff member has ever had issues with my needs. At this location the 3 staffers that were working there actually argued with me regarding MY food restrictions and I had to justify and explain my needs before they would make my sandwich. The level of ignorance and lack of professionalism was shocking. I will not be going back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"I have tried the 24 hour drive thru here twice, both times they have made my sub wrong... Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yesterday 6-15-16 I had a hankerin' for a meatball sub and stumbled upon this Subway around 5PM.  The area is a bit sketchy but I wasn't murdered and only one bum hit me up for a dollar on the way in so I consider that a success.  

The lady in front of me could not have been more of a pain in the ass.  She was ordering 5 different sandwiches at the same time and was on the phone with the rest of her family getting their orders.  Her conversation went like this...\"OKAY SARAH ASK JOEY IF HE WANTS PICKLES!  OK HE WANTS PICKLES. *subway guy puts pickles on it* WAIT WAIT WAIT HE CHANGED HIS MIND HE DOESN'T WANT PICKLES *subway guy takes them off* 

This went on for an excruciating 19 minutes and I've never felt sorrier for a person in my life as I did for that poor subway dude.  Kudos to you, Mr. Subway Sandwich Artist, you're the real American hero.  

I enjoyed my tasty $4 six inch meatball sub with cheese, toasted of course.  The meatballs were fresh and soft, the sauce was hot and tangy, the cheese was melty and gooey.  I was in meatball sammich heaven.  I guess they don't have the five dollar footlongs anymore but now they have a different sub each day for $3 for a six inch.  That's still a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"There was one employee making sandwiches and three people in line. Then another comes in from dumping the trash and doesn't wash his hands. He starts flipping the bread and then with a dirty towel wipes down everything . Remember he never washed his hands. Then he cashed out a guy and leaves. Now there is only one guy making sandwiches and 6 people in line. WTF"}
{"text":"Great first impression! Blanca took her time and patience with a smile to answer all my catering questions. Great sincere service!"}
{"text":"The food is the same like any other subway I been too, but what got me was the staff. The two ladies working didn't care much about the customers. One of them just stood there and did nothing, while I waited to get a cup for water. 
:("}
{"text":"I am absolutely appalled. Today is September 15 and it is 6:20pm. I have over 100 reviews and this may be my first or second one star review. I went through the drive thru and ordered a foot long tuna sandwich combo. The girl who took my order asked if i wanted extra meat for fifty cents I said no regular is fine. However, when I said that I didn't know that if I didn't say yes to the extra meat I would get no meat. This is what I call stealing. The employees have either been advised to do this by management or they just do this for whatever reason. If you are looking to see what Subway is near you to buy a sandwich and this location pops up, go to the next closest location. Or if you want to be served by employees who were obviously in a hurry as my no meat sandwich was sloppily put together, and overall demeanor of staff rushing their customers, this Subway meets all that criteria."}
{"text":"We got a sandwich about an hour ago and couldn't even eat it, it was horrible.  The bread tasted like it was a week old.  It literally broke apart, it was so stale.  I called and spoke to Dawn who could have cared less.  She never even said she was sorry.  She said the manager was not there and all she said when I told her how bad the bread was.... Oh !!!!  Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Subway subway subway. As much as I attempt to avoid you and the carbs that come with each visit, I can't. 

This is a really nice Subway, it's clean smells of fresh baked bread and cookies and not of cleaning products five stars for restaurant presentation.


Service greeting was dry, whatever maybe she is ready for lunch. I order a number 4 on honeyoat. She didn't know what the number four was. My first slice of honey oat was dry and nearly crumbled when she separated it. Understandable, I ask nicely for fresh slice of bread no problem. Everything is great until we get to the veggies.

Sandwich artist this lady is not. She piles all of the veggies on the middle of the sandwich. Like what? What about the two inches on each end that have nothing on them?? Butts need love too especially if I'm going to eat them.

Three out of five at best!

Hope you enjoyed my first review!"}
{"text":"been in this one located in Walmart a couple of times-people are usually rolling their eyes at you, act like they're doing you a favor and then make you feel as if you should've gone anywhere but there for a sandwich.  there's one in the food court in the outlet mall, just as close to me as this one-don't go very often but I'm going there from now on"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at this Subway, but it seems they may be under new management... The lady who helped me and my fiance seemed extemely annoyed the moment we started our order of 3 footlongs, slamming the door to the bread cabinet and sub toaster. I didnt really think much about it, until she started to put veggies on my sub... I asked for all veggies, and I got all the veggies all right! A decent amount of iceberg, 6 leaves of baby spinach, 4 olives, minimal other veggies, and yes I did ask for more... BUT THEN she actually dug through the tomato slices as the line grew behind us, not to give me the redest  juiciest slices, but the crunchiest and whitest slices as well as the end slices!! Wow! We left with the skimpiest subs we have ever gotten from a Subway.
All that being said, from what we could tell this Subway was clean and everything seemed fresh. Besides from feeling a little abused but mostly cheated, the food was up to Subway standards."}
{"text":"Good subway spot, but not the first to offer the specials (ie. didn't post a sign for \"free 6\" sub with 25 dollar gift card). Lots of business folk eat here, which means items are usually \"fresh\". Nice staff as well! 3 stars for the factor that it's a clean and friendly subway."}
{"text":"This is your typical Subway.

Some great features:  opened everyday till 2am, the ingredients are fresh, the service is good, the owner is hands on (he will jump on of it is busy) and good location."}
{"text":"A Subway like any other.  The staff turns quickly.  I don't think I've ever seen the same person twice.  Sometimes they get lost in chatter but it's decent overall.  In my experience the dining area and restrooms are always clean."}
{"text":"A great go to for a quick meal. Love the sweet onion sauce on a chicken breast sub! So good. Wish the pricing would stop going up though."}
{"text":"Today, I go into this Subway and their toaster is broken.  I had forgotten how much better toasters made sandwiches here.  Cold bread alone reduces this from a standard low cost quick food option to off my list.  I know this is a short term issue, but at least they could have warned me before starting my sandwich so I could have decided to skip it today."}
{"text":"This is the best Subway I've ever eaten in, hands down.  I'm starting to get the feeling that there are good ones and bad ones, though I'm doubt subway intends for the quality to be so variable--it is most certainly the case.  Even the bread was better than other locations, this must just be a freshness effect since I assume all the food comes from the same underlying supply.  Also, the more modern design suits Subway well.

As for fast food, this is one of the better spots, but it's still a Subway, so it's hard to justify better than a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Slowest and worst Subway experience ever. The workers weren't even trying to hustle (even when the line was 10+ people long at one point), and they just kept moving as slow as snails. They were so rude and kept acting like we were annoying them when we asked for a little more lettuce. While we were standing in line, one of the girls rudely said, \"You have to call ahead if you want more than 5 sandwiches\". We were all paying separately and weren't together? The girls' names were Dianne and Shayanne (sp?). Absolutely ridiculous. Never coming back."}
{"text":"This is not your TYPICAL subway where you order a sandwich, some grumpy worker caters to your every whim, you pay and leave. 

Not at this one. The man who runs this subway is a jolly round man who goes by \"Lucky.\" He talks with his customers, he jokes with them, and if you go frequently enough he'll remember your order, and ask how you have been since the last time you ate there. He's a great guy.

In addition to the wonderful service you get, this subway is VERY clean. I have been to plenty of subways where lettuce is on the counter, the tables are dirty, the floors are icky, and the soda machine is a mess. Lucky respects his store, his customers, and the Subway chain. The entire building is spotless.

Lastly, the decór. It has the typical subway look, but for Christmas it has been decked out! Each table has a mini Christmas tree, and a few other decorations are around as well.

Overall, I will definitely be returning, and I would DEFINITELY recommend this subway for great service and quality you can trust."}
{"text":"I come here every day I'm on lunch break for work. The staff is always friendly and more than willing to fulfill your request! I always order the sweet onion chicken teriyaki footlong on Italian herbs and cheese with three cookies! Best $9.68 I ever spent! This location usually isn't too busy, and they have at least 10 tables! Be sure to check out the $6 footlong of the month as well!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I really do love Subway . I go to this one cuz it's very close to where I live. I stopped in today to pick up two subs for lunch . There was one worker who claims his name is \" BRAIN PETERSON \" , I would describe him a tall, thin, while , with redish hair and a facial hair. He was so rude. I asked for cheese on my Veggie and he in a cocky way told me \" That's extra \" without even telling me how much more for it . Brian just pointed at the menu board and again never told me how much then it just went down hill from there. Did he upset me? Yes. Was he Rude ? Yes . Did he make my mood worse by getting in my face ? Hell Yes. I felt so bad for the cashier ( Marissa ) who has to work with such a cocky, rude like this dude. He could have tuned this into a good situation for me but he did not want to. I would suggest that BRIAN go back to Customer Service School and learn how to better how handle a loyal customer ( a female ) he pissed off by talking more and more rudely to others. Brian , I am ready to say I am sorry for what I said if you say how sorry you are first . I did ask for a manager but either Brian chose to not to hear me or really did not hear me. Brain - You need to be more care with your customers. All Customers even Women. I'm sure you have a mom, right? It will be a while for me to come back. Maybe I will send my husband . I know for a fact you wont take the same tone with me with him. Brian and Subway Team - Treat all your customers Dignity and Respect, even if you may not agree with them. You may never really know what is going on with someone."}
{"text":"It's a Subway and they do a good job of giving you Subway if that's what you want. 

Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Came here about 11pm one night after a show to grab a quick bite to take up to our room. 

The food was good and the staff were about as helpful as fast food staff always are, but the prices were simply outrageous. 2 Foot long subs cost about $25, which seemed steep even in Vegas."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a subway sandwich!!  Cold Cut Trio is my favorite
Fast friendly service at the Mall."}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch and happened to be in the area. I wasn't feeling anything from Arbys or Bojangles so I settled for Subway. While I prefer a full-on deli to these \"fast food sub chains\" I didn't know where the nearest one was. After eating here I wish I had taken the two minutes to pull out my phone and see what else was nearby.

It was pretty busy inside, which is to be expected at lunch time. There were three people working, so they weren't understaffed or anything, just working the busy lunch rush. While the staff were friendly, the food was just deplorable. I ordered the Subway Club and it ended up kinda turning me off. The roast beef was shredded and totally brown. Come on, roast beef should have at least a hint of red in it! But the ham was worse...the \"sandwich artist\" pulled out some ham and it was actually dripping wet as if it had been sitting in a pool of water. I couldn't believe when she moved to put it on my sandwich! I stopped her and told her I didn't want that ham, and she gladly went and grabbed a new stack. 

After eating here I think I'm officially turned off from the likes of Subway and the other chains like it. I'm generally picky with my cold cuts and will usually go out of my way to ensure it's Boars Head or bust. I'm kind of surprised with my lazy self for settling and it's something I won't be doing again. If you want a wet, soggy cold cut sandwich go to Subway. If that's not your thing, definitely avoid it."}
{"text":"Nice Subway across from the Hard Rock Hotel on Paradise. It's kind of hidden behind 7-ELEVEN next to Robertos. 
Not much of a wait, but it was quite busy in evening. 
I ordered the Black Forest Ham footlong with the works! Only $5.40. That's a great deal for the size and all the extras. 
Can never go wrong with Subway, always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Really nice subway at Hughes Center. Very clean and nice location. They do charge a bit more for their subs, but only found that out when I went to get the same sub at another location the next day? I wonder why they do that? I thought they all have same prices? I guess not. No biggy, I like this store and will go back again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Subway. There are others closer but this one is always clean and friendly and always remember me and my sister. You can't see it in the pics- but they have two nice sitting areas so you can eat and chat and not feel rushed. Deff the place you want to check out!"}
{"text":"I went in after working late at around 11. The employee that made my sandwich was very nice (that's the one star).

I ordered a 6-inch sandwich with a meal, which comes with a drink and 2 cookies. He made the wrong sandwich in front of me, which I was willing to overlook because I was so hungry. Then I realized that the meal he gave me came with only 1 cookie, and the soda was flat. He also charged me for a footlong with the cookie and drink a la carte (no meal deal, more expensive).

I brought all of this to his attention, but he was just clueless about everything. I had to explain to him what the menu said about the 2 cookies and drink, and he couldn't figure out how to get me a refund.

Worthless."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today to grab a quick lunch with my husband.  We have been to this location a couple times, and always had bad service.  But, we were in the area and we're hoping for better service this time.  NOPE!  The kid putting the sandwich together seemed very upset by us coming in there and disturbing him.  When we looked for a place to sit, every single table was dirty.  Mind you, we were the only people in there - so it wasn't like they were busy.  The manager of this location really needs to step it up and get the employees in line.  This location is awful!"}
{"text":"Theee stars because the employee who was working was all by herself! She handled several people before us, and a few after us and she always had a smile on her face and pleasant demeanor. I was shocked to find out that she was the only employee until closing. It was the decision made by the owner regarding staffing. Not very safe! 

Sandwiches were consistent with the subway brand."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon, lunch time,  one employee and a line. My husband and son have been in line for almost 30 minutes waiting to place an order. My daughter and I ordered Pizza next door and have been patiently waiting for them to work their way through the line with our food ready to go. We stopped at another Subway on the way here, and even though they were supposed to be open according to the hours posted on the door, they were closed. Is Subway not able to run their businesses of late? Really poor service in more than one location."}
{"text":"If you love eye rolls, terrible attitudes, scuffs, and overly added mustard on your sandwich then this is the place. I wasn't even being picky or over demanding, yet even if I was I shouldn't be treated like that, this review is from a current 20 year old restaurant server, and I am not like that. This is the only place in the city of Scottsdale that I've been disappointed by."}
{"text":"I must concur with Vivek: this location is OK, but nothing to write home about. It's usually well-staffed for the lunchtime rush, but I find the layout to be subpar for the traffic it normally sees. I've been in a couple times where a mere handful of people result in a lineup right out the door, and inconvenience for anyone who happens to be sitting down. I've also had communication issues with employees* at times - I don't know if it was noise or lack of attention, but depending on the crew working here, I find myself repeating my order several times.

Far more of an issue, though, is that the last few times we've come here, the sandwiches quickly fell apart upon getting back to the office. I don't consider it part of the Subway experience to have to re-insert my toppings into the sub I'm trying to eat. Most of the time, though, this hasn't been an issue, so I'll give them a pass for now.

I will say this, though: their customer-facing display on the cash register doesn't seem to work, and that really bugs me. Maybe more than it should.

Overall verdict: normally decent food with a few annoyances.

* - I refuse to call them sandwich artists."}
{"text":"It's yet another franchise shop, so I'll get to the point: this is far and away... not my favourite location. It's convenient for where I live, so I'm here from time to time, but generally if I can't think of anything better.

The quality of the food isn't usually the issue here - it's pretty well up to Subway standards. Service usually leaves something to be desired, even by Subway standards. My least favourite aspect of this location, though, is prices - the normal prices are higher than most Subways I've been to, and they frequently seem to opt out of the deals that the rest of the chain runs. I realize it's up to the franchisees to offer the deals or not, but it'd be nice to get a deal once in a while.

The upshot is there are a few other locations around, so maybe I'll start walking a little further when I want a sandwich."}
{"text":"DO NOT USE DEBIT CARD HERE. THEY HAVE A CARD READER AND ARE STEALING PEOPLE MONEY AND CARD INFO. Made a purchase with debit card cashier said transaction declined however he threw away the receipt. Contacted my back which informed me transactions was processed and approved. Manager and owner refused to give me my food or money.  I had to contact the police then the owner began to argue with him. I was then informed to go to Magistrate Office beacuse it is a civil suit. All this for a scappy $5 sandwich. In short use your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The staff at this location seem to not care at all. Very skimpy on the sandwiches. Also, not one of them can wrap a sandwich properly. Every time I get home the sandwich is falling apart due to the halfassed wrapping"}
{"text":"I am waiting for gluten-free bread. News releases say it's coming. Subway offers veggie sandwich but can a business please offer vegan and gluten-free options? 
There is a drive-thru so that's a plus!
One more request, please offer ORGANIC juice boxes and milk boxes please. Dump the Minute Maid brand, I am going to Starbucks across the street for organic drinks and the drive-thru."}
{"text":"I've gotten lunch here a dozen times. The line is always long, the staff is friendly and the food is typical subway. I have no problem asking for additional vegetable toppings and the staff will oblige and add more. The prices are the same you'll pay at any subway which is nice,considering it's a downtown location."}
{"text":"Horrible service never coming back ! Super slow forgetting items , condiments, my napkins ! Wrong sandwich one! Now wrong price for my sub! Needs new employees asap ! May 7  3 pm"}
{"text":"Subway food quality is pretty much the same in all branches. What makes this branch different is that they are far from busy crowded areas like food courts in malls. 
The place always has seats available. It is quiet and the place is clean. 
There is always parking I front or across Subway inside the plaza."}
{"text":"A male worker at this Subway doesn't understand that the gloves only cover the hands not the entire arm as he uses his arm and elbow to open the sandwich. Gross. I love Subway but I turn around when I saww this person working and head over to Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Located inside the food court of Bally's.

Prices are double of what you would normally pay outside. I tried to save $4 by not buying a soda and just getting a glass of water, but they didn't even have this available. I said \"no thanks\" to the $4 water bottle too.

I was 4th in line and it took a good 15 minutes to finally pay for my expensive sub."}
{"text":"I cant even begin to explain how angry and upset I am right now. I have been going to this location for a year and I always order extra onions on my chicken sandwich. when ever  there is a new employee making my sandwich they always snide and snicker and makes jokes about the onions. Usually I just ask them if I am paying for comedy and judgement with my food and they never make the jokes again. this has happened several times. My husband went into the subway location and the GM was there along with an employee who recognized my husband and has made our food before and was aware of how much I hate the onion jokes. My husband comes home and on my sandwich is ONION SANDWICH WITH A SMILEY FACE. I am now livid. I called and the GM answered and immediately he denied everything and said he was unaware of it, that he didnt know, that he didnt do it. He became argumentative. I was in tears. Right now I am pregnant and I am extremely emotional. I told him I was calling corporate. I call and customer service and a man named chris answered. He was aggressive, condescending, rude, and hostile. He asked me what I wanted them to do about it. I was in shock and said thats not my job. He then informed me he would have the owner call me. He became more and more angry, and at the end of the call I asked for his supervisor. He said WHY? I said because I asked. He then started yelling at me, saying he had done everything he was suppose to. I then said again I want a supervisor. He said there wasnt one. I said you cant be the only person there. and he claimed he was, that there was no supervisor, said he no employee # or way to identify himself, and then he hung up on me,  I am so angry, and upset how horribly I have been treated today."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd be compelled to write a review on a Subway experience! Don't know his name but the tall black dude made the best Subway sandwich I've ever had. Ingredients were SUPER fresh at this location and he put them together so well! He was also really kind and personable!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the other reviews are talking about! We all know how subway is and how it works. Most subways now are 24 hours, and the food quality is consistent through most. What I'm complaining about is the serious lack of customer service, and the fact that they are stingy with their toppings."}
{"text":"I'm from Houston and visited here for work. The lines were ridiculously long for a lunch hour. Parking is also horrible as the parking spots are made for ford fiestas only. Save yourself sometime and go to tr subway by the Hilton garden inn if your at noon."}
{"text":"Ordered my sub meal from the mobile app... My meal was ready on time. Really Really enjoyed."}
{"text":"They are now open 24 hours! I like this location not because it is conveniently located near my work place but because of the service there! 

They know me by name and know what sandwiches I like. I usually pick between 3 so they always make it into a guessing game. 

Linda is my favorite there, she is the sweetest. When there are new employees she introduce us to each other and she tells them what I normally get and when I say extra pickles I mean give me a eff ton of pickles. My love of pickles is weird, I know, but they do not judge me!! :) 

The food there is standard subway grub what sets them apart is cleanliness and customer service."}
{"text":"Got a sub here last night around 11:45 pm.  The girl making the sandwiches was absolutely dreadful.  Don't know her name, but she had an eyepatch on.  She was not friendly to any of the customers, and wow was she painfully slow.  I'm talking, I waited 3rd in line and it probably took 15-20 minutes to get out of there.  Literally three people left because it was taking so long.  Definitely not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"My wife bought a meatball sandwich here and to her absolute disgust found gum in it.  Apart from being totally grossed out, she was on her way to a lecture and had to miss lunch as she was not going to eat it and threw it away!

Sloppy hygiene, sabotage, bad management or a staff that simply does not care? Does not matter - needless to say we will never buy anything here again."}
{"text":"Really clean location, and great staff.  You never have to repeat your order, and they keep up with lunch rush.  Even with the long lines I'm usually in & out in a few minutes."}
{"text":"Came here twice, the first time the guy hooked it up (like the reviews said) with mad toppings it was insane and no longer looking like a sandwich (whatever, not complaining about that).  

Second time I ordered from an older woman who proceeded to hover after I paid and was getting a lid and straw for my soda, presumably because she thought I was derelict and going to steal something?  Who knows.  It was annoying and unappreciated.  I got my room card out so that it was visible that I wasn't some hobo patronizing the casino subway, lol"}
{"text":"Horrible service the employees were rude. Customers walking out employees yelling for workers to come out of the back. Over heard a customer telling the guy that made his sandwich what he didn't put the right amount of meat in the sandwich employee said \"oh I didn't notice\" I was just given a total not asked if I wanted anything else \"chips and a drink\" which I did and the clerk just tossed my receipt on the counter. Never have I witnessed such a disorganized and rude group of workers. Will. Or be coming back and highly don't recommend wasting your timing going there. If I could 0 star I would."}
{"text":"Tom and Kobe (sorry if I spelled it wrong) are the epitome of PROFESSIONAL customer service in this industry, whenever I deal with great customer care, my experience is significantly better. They made the sandwich exactly as I wanted and did it with a smile. Thanks guys!!!!!"}

{"text":"Sandwich is dry... I will stick to Jimmy Johns... Got fooled by the $4 lunch special..."}
{"text":"The girl there Ashton is suuuuper slow I almost lost my appointment because of her bad service and super slow I won't be back to this location again!!! U lost a customer"}
{"text":"Really disappointed! Bread (Italian) old, fresh veggies were dried out! I know they have a certain amount of meat & cheese they are allowed ( your choice), especially sandwich of the day. But, 3-4 slices of ham & 2 pieces of provolone cheese? Rather travel to my favorite sub shop (which is really a cafe) than come back here and be disappointed. Commercials they show on Tv! Take 3/4 off of bread, meat, cheese & condiments! Think Subway needs a makeover!"}
{"text":"The sandwich maker tried to pull a fast one on me by covering the scoop used the measure the chicken and give me way less than half a scoop. When I called him out on it he  laughed and said that's how they are made... 

I went ahead and had him make 5 total sandwiches with double meat, double guacamole, double bacon, extra cheese, all toasted, filled with veggies and lots of sauce... when it was time to pay I laughed and said that's how it should be made and walked out. 

Negative 5 stars"}
{"text":"I work in the area and visit this location a few times per week.  All of the team members there have been courteous to me whether busy, slow, or whatever.  I appreciate them and I hope their management does too."}
{"text":"Having to pay for a lyft to get there and realize they weren't serving meatballs, bummer. Oh well. Life goes on. I can understand that an item is not being made anymore. Food quality, sure. To get home and not even be able to enjoy your soda (with the sandwich you had in mind) due to it being flat? That just tops everything. Did you run out of coke as well? Come on subway. Big thumps down!"}
{"text":"This Subway is very convenient to my work, which I love for getting a quick and healthy lunch.  It can get busy at lunch time, but even with about 8 people in front of me yesterday in line I only had to wait about 10 minutes.  Another plus is that even though they share a small parking lot with a lot of other businesses, there are always at least a few open spots."}
{"text":"I'm one of those people who don't bring lunch to work a lot.  It's a horrible decision and it's a waste of money... trust me I know.  So on many occasions, depending on schedule I will run out and grab something quick.  Over the past week, this was pretty much me every day.

For one of those days I decided to grab something quick.  So I went Subway to grab a $5 foot long meatball sub.  Now to me, the only way subway is healthy is if you don't put on any sauce and you opt for the turkey sub.  See, I'm a saucy guy and without sauce or any kind of dressing it's almost wrong in my eyes.

I got my meatball sub with cheese toasted and here's my list of toppings. =P.  Lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, green pepper, red onion, pickles and honey mustard on top.  Now some may say that's way too much on a subway, especially on a meatball sub.  But to me, it's good, it's filling and for $5 I can't really see where you can go wrong.  And trust me, adding toppings and adding honey mustard is a win win move.  Try it... you might be surprised.

Overall, Subway is a choice that I do make whenever I encounter a hectic work schedule.  I mean for $5 you get a foot long of food, it's not a bad choice.  As well, if you like the taste of Subway like me, it's a good choice to be making, especially for a workday lunch.  A note, this subway location gets quite busy with the lunch rush.  Try to go a little earlier I say around 11:30 or prepare an extra 10 mins.  Subway, eat Fresh.=P"}
{"text":"Its Subway. Thats about all their is to say about this place. I will say it is a very clean well run store and the owner takes pride in this location."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Subway (particularly their chipotle mayo sauce and cookies), but I've discovered that it can really be hit and miss. I went to this location since my normal go-to Subway was already closed for the night. Although there was no wait, the sandwich artist actually told me she was \"out of it\". She had already worked a long shift but had to work even later since the next worker was tardy. There should be a better policy in place for times like these. I had to repeat myself several times and remind the worker what went on the sandwich. As she was putting on avocado, I realized she had forgotten the cheese too. This location gives you free cookies for add-ons which is always a plus, but it can't make up for my experience. As if that wasn't enough, the total ended up being about $5 more than I usually pay, and I order the same thing every time. Get your act together, Subway!"}
{"text":"I went into subway this evening to grab a foot long real fast, and was saddened when I walked in and there were three employees working who did not make any effort to greet me in any manner. I walked over to my first station, hoping one of them would acknowledge I was there and possibly serve me, but I stood there with crushed hopes for a solid 4-5 minutes while Kim dished out some cookies in the display, and Joey finished up mopping in the lobby. Now, Kim attempted to tell me she'd be with me, but she did so in a not so polite manner, which made me feel as if I wasn't welcome. Joey, while not the closest to serving me, hurried up and came around and helped me. Joey was exceptionally kind to me after the initial silence, maybe just a little shy at first. The fresh baked cookies were delicious, and like I said, Joey was very nice once he got around to helping me, however Kim could have helped me at any moment, or been a bit more polite and I wouldn't have minded waiting a few more minutes. For the third employee towards the back, they stood in the same spot the whole time messing with a box, so I'm not too sure what was going on there. Haha."}
{"text":"This is the closest Subway to my house, and I went in today again to give this location another chance and was severely disappointed once again. The service here is not only lacking, but needs a complete turn around. Why advertise broccoli cheddar soup all day every day when you never have it available and your staff makes such a big deal about having to heat some more up? It's literally your job to have it ready to go, but instead you have a crusty/old container full of remnants of what once was soup. Aside from that, the staff NEVER washes their hands. Like literally. Health code states you have to wash your hands before putting on a new pair of gloves and when they come from the back off their break and start serving you food, it's nasty. As well as Kevin and the other guy working today around 5pm who cashiered multiple times and went right back to making sandwiches without washing their hands. Uhh, money is disgusting? Also, touching your mouth and going back to making food isn't sanitary either? I feel like all of these things are simple, common sense items but somehow they can't grasp an elementary aspect of being food safe? Speaking of food safe, health code also states you must have someone who is Serv-Safe Certified working a kitchen at all times, neither of those guys on staff were certified let me tell you. Or if they were, they completely disregard all things health code. (Coming from someone who does manage a kitchen, I don't know how they have an A. I'm assuming they flip their ish around when they know the health inspection will be coming around.) Anyway, this location has most certainly lost my service and I'll warn everyone I know away from this one so they don't get sick from their food. I wish they had a store managers number/email listed in their store, but again that shows they probably just don't care enough."}
{"text":"Just a run of the mill Subway. Ate there last week and noticed a good size cockroach run under the chip rack.

I don't think I will be back..."}
{"text":"Located inside the Monte Carlo's Food Court, it's among one of a few familiar choices for restaurants. Prices are higher than normal, of course we're in Vegas and in a food court, so it's expected. But to make your sandwich a meal? Whoa!!!! Take an average of $6.75 for a 6\" sandwich, then ADD $3-$3.50 for soda and chips. You've got yourself a $10 Subway meal! Wow! The food is nothing really special. The same as any other subway in America. I would return here only if I had to.

-1 Star for the prices 
-1 Star for bland service. But why be surprised about this, right?

3-Stars \"A-OK\" just because my experience was just okay."}

I have money\" then he apologizes he put 2 pieces of bacon on my foot long my response \"excuse me normally they put 4 on a foot long is this your first day?\" Him \" no its not but if i put 4 bacon i have to charge you $1.50 2 is only  .75\" my response \" yea i know i can read and once again I HAVE MONEY\" He finally finished my sub i sat down to eat and the slow guy didnt even cut my foot long in half. It wasnt even busy in here for him to look as stressed  out or confused  as he seemed to be he needs extensive training on how to move faster and understand some people are financially stable in life and $1.50 is not a big deal to them it is rude to treat a customer like they are broke or cant afford what they are asking for. The guys name is Goran the dining area was also a mess usually its nice and clean at this location."}

No more supporting  this location and I am sure to tell all the business around this area too."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying if I can get this place -5 star review I would! 

We were at the Bluegreen resort in Las Vegas California. Location is under the hotel room attached to the hotel. The wife and son were hungry so we decided to grab a sandwich. 

Let's start by saying we were not welcomed when we walked in the door. The toppings look old and everything was empty. All I wanted was a soup. The rude customer service representative for subway told me sorry were out of soap. Could have said I need to make more so it will take 15 minutes I would've said okay I'll send my son down in 15 minutes.  No she told me no soup when I ask is there in the back she said yes with an attitude and walked away. I didn't see her again for the entire time we're there. 

The other customer service representative for subway. Was also rude and not look at us smile anything. When my wife asked for mustard the container was empty and instead of going to get a fresh container she continued to squeeze and squeeze to get the last bit out of that container. 

On my sons sandwich he wanted a scoop of tuna. \"The lady said sorry we can't do that\" He then replied my dad will pay extra. \"Lady then said sorry we cannot do that\"

This subway will definitely ruin my experiences going to any subway in the future. 

I only leave reviews if I have the best experience or the worst experience because I believe people come to Yelp looking for these type of reviews so that they can make better choices of the restaurants etc. they visit."}
{"text":"If one could judge the Subway alone, it would be a good 4 starts.  But since you can't....

This is a small shopping strip.  It's not the nicest either.  Ok, that is me being PC.  It's kinda crappy.  BUT - Since it has both the closest Subway, Dairy Queen and Pizza Hut to my house, I have to go there.  The Subway is right between the DQ and the neighborhood Discount Smoke shop.  Well, and the kid selling boot leg CD's and DVD's for $5/each.  He often looks bored waiting out there, but last time he actually had a few customers.  

Back to the Subway.  It's actually quite good! The people there have all been quite helpful.  And they always have spinach and cucumbers to put on the sandwiches!  That became one of my markers of a good Subway once I realized how many folks don't offer it.  

Anyhow, so it's a little scary to folks who might not be comfortable in the area, but once you go inside, it's sandwich goodness."}
{"text":"The staff is good and the sandwiches are sandwiches. My complaint is an owner who allows the AC to be out of order for multiple days and doesn't any seem to mind putting the staff and ultimately the food temp safety at risk."}
{"text":"Came in at night with my girl and my mom. My Moms first time, long story short rubi(or ruby) was very helpful and gave great customer service. Made things easy and simple . Highly recommend ruby."}
{"text":"First time I have been to this location, usually I go to Tropicana and Jones.  Sunday morning at 10am, they are all out of egg (white and yellow) for breakfast sandwiches which are by the way, are served all day.  Also out of olives, and something else (I forget right now)."}
{"text":"Every time I come here this guy named Marty Texas time never says hello never smiles never greets anyone. I don't mind people taking their time with this guy seriously has no sense of urgency especially if there's a lot of people. I came in today to get the special and I specifically asked for the special oven roasted chicken he gives me a rotisserie chicken.  I'm not supposed to know the difference I don't know I just assume he knows what he's doing.  He brings me out is the wrong price I bring it up and he states that he gave me the wrong thing never apologizes. Says he's going to make a new sandwich and start scraping off the chicken for the sandwiches already made.  Instead of me wasting food and instead of him using his commonsense I just paid for the sandwich and left. I donor stand who this guy is like his job he should just quit. It's always a problem when I come here but I can't because it's convenient I guess that's what I get."}
{"text":"This is a 2nd review. Young teens that do not know how to pay attention."}
{"text":"We have had subs out of here a few times. Always seems like the people that work here just don't listen when you say how you want the sub made.
There have been times we have been in at night and the worker has friends there or they are busy and not too happy to be there alone.
We prefer the one not far from here. up near Providence they make much better subs and everything seems fresher there."}
{"text":"I love this subway! The food is always made just the way I want it and the staff has always been very nice and efficient. They will always have my business!"}
{"text":"Best subway in the area! The guys who work here are so freakin' nice! Don't go to the one by Fry's if you live in this area, come to this one, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This subway is ALWAYS stingy. It doesn't matter who is making the sandwiches there is always more bread than meat cheese and veggies. I do not recommend ever going to this subway. My sandwich sucks everytime"}
{"text":"Multiple attempts at using Subway's mobile coupons at this store with over charged results. I asked today how do I know when they will honor my coupon from subway corporate and was told \"Ask when you get here.\" Well at that point it is too late because I'm going to buy my food from you since I'm here. 

I have no plans to go back to this location. I've never had difficulty using the mobile coupons at West View nor Millvale but the manager here wants to steal your money. My 2 footling meal deals for $12 cost me $14.12 and I didn't even get the meal deals. After he told me \"we aren't doing that one this week\" and started up charging me I refused anything but the cookies for my kids and went to the grocery store for sodas and chips, ended up costing me $2.50 there but I saved $3 over what he wanted. The $12 all including coupon would have cost me $19 at this place."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich like I usually do and took it to go, and when I started eating, the bread was ROCK HARD!! Why would you give a customer hard bread is my question. Now I can't enjoy my meal I paid for. Also the employees were very rude."}
{"text":"Went here at 9:30pm tonight (10/30/16). They close at 2am (this is relevant). Walk in and stand there for a solid two minutes before anyone comes from the back. There's one guy working by himself (heavier young guy with sandy blonde hair). Guy doesn't say hello or greet us at all. Puts his gloves on and then says, \"the microwave and toaster are off for the night.\" I said, \"But aren't you guys open until 2am?\" He says, \"Yeah, but I've already cleaned them for the night.\" Dude! You're open for 4.5 more hours! The toaster and microwave don't take very long to clean. And by shutting them down - you're cutting off at least half of the menu to customers. We walked out. This place has to be losing a lot of money every time this guy works by himself."}
{"text":"AJ is the best employee I've ever experienced at a subway, friendly, polite, professional. Just what we needed after getting back into town. He is leaps a bounds ahead of most other employees I've come across."}
{"text":"You would think all Subways are the same, so what's the difference here? 

I'm no amateur, and wasn't born yesterday. I swear the kid jipped me on my tuna for a 6 inch sub. He gave me two scoops. I know I know, I'm sounding petty, but that extra third scoop I've gotten from other locations for a 6 inch have been vital to my sandwich experience. 

The kids who work here look 16-18 years old, and they sure look pretty over their jobs. I know it's hard to get excited about making sandwiches all day, but let's be decent workers. After all, unemployment is high, and there's people without a job. 

Besides that, all Subways pretty much taste the same."}
{"text":"Nothing bad or good to say about this Subway. It is a typical Subway. I am just happy there is one close to my house and it honors the 5 dollar foot long deal! I once went to a Subway that offered garlic as a condiment. This one needs to add it to their menu. It makes the Meatball Sandwich so much better."}
{"text":"Horrible service by Ana. Came here for my 30 min lunch break & the whole time I was telling her what I would like on my sandwich she was busy talking to her co-worker about her getting off early only if he approves. With her talking she wasn't really focusing on what I wanted in my meal. I got to work, opened up my sandwich & see the most sloppiest sandwich I've EVER had!! 

I couldn't really enjoy my meal since I was too busy picking up all the veggies that kept falling off of my sandwich"}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient service with employees who've worked here for many years (one guy who looks like Andy Bell from Erasure in his younger days I've watched working his way up to shift leader).  They're next door to a high school so I imagine they must put up with a lot of nonsense, monkey business, and high stress on a regular basis but this doesn't deter them from being consistently patient and professional.  Have never experienced any issues with order accuracy, service, or cleanliness.  Only problems encountered have been minor nitpicks (i.e. most recent order didn't have any napkins included which I really could have used) or issues more with chain as a whole as opposed to this specific location (like their prices going out of control.)"}
{"text":"A typical Subway with reliable, fast, fresh food. Very kind and welcoming workers! Quiet environment with lots of food options. No problems whatsoever."}
{"text":"Today, I ordered with an African American guy, who asked me what I wanted. I asked for the soup and sub meal, and he immediately slaps chicken on my sub... even though I didn't ask for chicken? Once I corrected him to ham, he rudely made a comment about how that's not the sub of the day.. Well I didn't ask for the sub of the day? Clearly not paying attention to me, since the guy ordering ahead of me got the sub of the day. (I hope his meal turned out better than mine.) 

The entire time I was ordering, all 3 employees, (one with arm tattoos, African American, and an older gentleman of the name Patrick) all seemed to pay more attention to the line coming through the door rather than help the guests that were ordering. None of them had a smile on their face or a pleasant attitude when talking and ordering. The communication was poor, the music was too loud and they were shouting at each other even though they were all standing next to one another. Not to mention, the employees looked like they hated their lives and one another. 

The quantity of vegetables on my sub was next to nothing, I asked for lettuce and I got hardly a pinch. I asked for green peppers and he gave me cucumbers. I asked for green peppers once more, and I only got two, literally two slices until I asked for more. I'm not the only one who had to ask for more, because the three people ahead of me had to ask the same. 

The presentation was horrendous. All of my toppings slid off as the guy helping me threw my sandwich to Patrick working cashier. 

Patrick was the most pleasant to associate with, he checked on those sitting down eating and seemed to be doing most of the working, communicating, and maintenance. 

Overall, I had an awful experience. I won't be returning to this Subway location, especially due to the many other reviews about the same African American employee who has probably yet to be given consequences for his poor attitude. 

Obviously this manager does not care how crappy his store is to the public. Seems like he needs to have a long talk with a few of his employees about attitude."}
{"text":"they usually have everything that any othe subway would have. so consider my 3 stars as per other subways. the place is alright good seating, sub par subway smell, you know what i mean.

the only problems that i see are that the employees are predominantly russian, or rather from the stan former soviet republics. i'm racist and all but in this case it makes ordering slightly harder. still they are nice there.

i eat here all the time for lunch since i like sandwiches a lot. cheapest high quality sandwich footlong blt with tons of veggies and sweet onion sauce. veggies are free bro learn to like them higher calorie/dollar and much better nutrient/dollar. 6 inch go crazy its all cheap"}
{"text":"This place is very clean and just opened.   There is plenty of parking and lots of deals.  I always feel good coming here because they have a lot of choices and the food is healthier than other fast food places.  For $5 you can choose a drink, chips, and a 6 inch of the day."}
{"text":"I love subway in general.  They have the $5 foot long subs.  My favorite is the BMT Sub which has ham, salami, and pepperoni.  I like my sub with the Italians herb and cheese bread with pepper-jack cheese and toasted.  Their cookies aren't too bad either, which are 3 for $1.25.  I like the white chocolate and macadamia nut and the cheesecake ones are good too.

This location is kinda small, but very clean.  The customer service is pretty normal."}
{"text":"I go to this subway all the time as it is close to my mom's home for dinner.  It's clean and small, but usually not busy after 4pm.  The lines move pretty quickly. Some places will give you barely any ingredients, but this places gives the right amount, but I always ask for extra olives, spinach, and tomatoes and they never question me or give me a face.  I like to save money, so I always try to get the subs that are a good deal.  They have daily specials where you can get a certain sub, drink, and chips for $5.  They also have certain subs for $5 and monthly a special sub for $5.  

My favorite subs are the tuna, BMT, and spicy italian.  As for location, the place is always clean and I always have a place to sit.  Sometimes I will sit and do my work, and they don't give me any problems."}
{"text":"Love going to this Subway location (we drive several miles out of our way)...this restaurant is always clean and the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"So I went in today and they had no avocado, spinach, or cucumbers. Staff was nice but had to leave a terrible review because of what I received. This is what was in the chip bag I received. There are these nasty \"rocks\" of something in my chip bag and It literally made me throw up. How dare they carry revulsive shit like this. I'm still in shock and will NEVER go here or likely any other Subway EVER again."}
{"text":"Pre-paid 2 subs through a popular food website, but never received the delivery. Employee we spoke to said they \"totally forgot\" the order, but seemed nice enough, asking us to call back tomorrow. Called back for 3 days and nobody had the tools necessary to check our order (isn't it 2014?). Even the manager was unable/unwilling to verify, asking us demand a refund from the ordering website. 

Crazy idea, but maybe a better customer service approach would have been to fulfill the order, but that's none of my business..."}
{"text":"On my way home the other day I decided to stop at the Rockside Road Subway and am beyond happy that I did. I know that many people may think of subway as this huge conglomerate of a chain and that the food is super standardized, and I agree to a point. However, the sandwiches and salad that I had from here were so good, and so fresh, I have been thinking of them ever since.

While I was there, I ordered a foot long turkey sub and also a salad--in case you do not know, they can make any sub into a salad and my goal was to eat half of each and take the rest for lunch the next day. The Rockside Subway is very well managed, clean, tidy and filled with friendly staff. I decided that I would eat there and then head home. My sub was excellent and while I wish I would stop there, my salad was excellent time 10. I had a salad filled with every fresh vegetable there and loaded with diced chicken--it was perfect and I gobbled the whole thing up.

If you have not had the chance to get a salad at Subway--suggest you do. And, I know there a hundreds of places to eat in this city, but Subway cannot be beat for its freshness and value. Love the Rockside store and would visit again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Super rude. Doesn't listen. Makes your meal wrong, doesn't change out gloves after orders or dropping something on the ground, has their friends there hanging out.  Definitely not going back to this location. So many health code violations. I suggest go to another location"}
{"text":"The amazing thing about this Subway is it's the worst quality in the entire Subway chain.
We've dined at Subways from coast to coast, border to border.
Employees at the Sams Town location have no clue what they are doing and the sandwiches suffer.
A whole new definition of indifferent attitude and slow service too.

Only good Subways are where an owner is a hands on operator and this casino location is a ship with no captain. No supervision nor assurance of quality.
Watch customers turn around and walk out after waiting long times despite no line with no one in front of them.

This is THE worst Subway you will ever visit.
Bad food, bad attitudes and very bad service.

The 5 star review is a shill."}
{"text":"My go to location. Always friendly and order is made correctly. Much better than the stephanie/American pacific location."}
{"text":"The staff is always pleasant and professional even at the busy lunch rush. They always make it a point to make sure you want the sandwich the way you want it. The wraps was delicious."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Never staffed, sandwiches are crap.... Always some new excuse here. Avoid!!!"}
{"text":"As I walk into this subway the guy at the cash register says nothing guess he couldn't be bothered to get off his phone call with a friend, so he yells to the woman in the back to come to the front to help me with my order as he still is talking on his cellphone. I get to register still not a word to anyone. I choose to eat in and what do you know he's still on the phone at the register. Usually when working yo get off the phone when a customer walks in or go in the back."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was extremely disappointed with this Subway. I was running errands  yesterday and I wanted to stop in and get something to eat before my pool league started. The girl that was behind the counter had reddish, brownish hair and she sneezed two times while handling the food. I was shocked that after she sneezed, she did not even wash her hands or put on new gloves. Then when she asked me what I wanted, I said \"I would like a Steak and Cheese with double meat, and I would like the bread toasted, and the meat and cheese nice and hot.\" She only gave me the regular portion of meat not double meat, and the meat and cheese were not hot. She charged me $14 for the sandwich, and when I explained to her that she had charged me way too much and that she gave me the wrong portion, rather than trying to fix the problem she unfortunately was rude and had a sorry attitude. I will definitely never go to this Subway again."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now, because it's right on the way home from my boyfriend's work. 

It's different depending on what \"sandwich artist\" you get. The first time I had the egg sandwich which was full of egg and deliciousness! 

The second time I went there, ordered the same thing (I don't eat meat.) and the guy was SO slow. It took him over 15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich. No joke. Not only did he take forever, but he hardly put any egg on the sandwich. 

If I see that guy in the window again, I will not go in."}
{"text":"Just like any other good Subway friendly service only one girl running the show that's all you need to keep the prices down"}
{"text":"Pretty clean place nice part of town be there couple times only order a sandwich at a time is the only way to get it the right way last time I was there I order three foot longs I want to have one half toasted I was hoping I can have a hot sandwich not  this time by the time they finish all the sandwiches by the time he charged by the time I had a sandwich on my hand it was already cold the hot toasted sandwich is a joke."}
{"text":"Thursday around 1 o'clock p.m. I order 6 inch Italian BMT the girl at the counter seems to be new ask the older lady some instructions she was very pleasant I should prepare my sandwich the sandwich was very good until that last bite.
Where I found a hair mixed with the  food in my mouth got stuck on my tooth I tried to contact the store but no answer on the phone and I just wanna let you know it was a short hair on my sandwich by the way the girl at the counter she got long hair."}

BOGO.....YEAH... 
Well only Coke products but no soda water so easy to adapt but who know if we ask ...
The sandwiches was good the older lady was nice ....."}
{"text":"We needed something quick and filling, so why not subway?

It was kinda late when we stopped by, we couldn't decide on what or where to eat so we ended up here lol.. it's right around the corner of a friends house that I was visiting at the time, so it was convenient.

The reason for the 4 stars is because of the great service we received! It's a typical subway with your typical subway food. Nothing extraordinary about that part..

When we walked in, we were greeted right away by a young gentleman. We made a little conversation with him and he seemed genuinely interested and happy to help. We took a little bit of extra time talking to him since the place was empty. We then placed our order, he rang us up and that was that. 

As we were walking out the door, so was he...

He was actually off the clock already and his ride had been waiting outside for him the whole time! Anybody else would have rushed out the door the second we walked in. Unfortunately I did not get his name, but he is greatly appreciated!"}
{"text":"This Subway is a great location as the staff is super friendly and their bread is nice and fresh baked!

They have the deal going for a $2.00 6 inch meatball marinara or cold cut combo sub so we got two foot long cold cut combos!


Yum the toppings were fresh and generous and the bread which I tried was the parmesan cheddar bread and it was delicious!

What a deal it only cost us $15 bucks for two foot long subs, two large drinks, two packs of chips and 3 fresh chocolate chip cookies!

We will be back to this Subway location again for sure because it was a nice treat and they are above average compared to some of the other Subway stores around town!"}
{"text":"This location has got to be one of the worst in town. The night we visited they were out of soup, yes I wanted some broccoli and cheese soup with my sandwich. The gal tells me, if I would like some I can wait 15 minutes for them to heat some up. I declined. They were also out of Iced tea, she said they don't make it at night time. This location is 24-7 and it was only 7:00 pm. Anyways, the worst offense was that my wheat sub roll was dry and stale. I called the next day and voiced my concerns with their operations. The Manager was apologetic and said she would look into it. She seemed genuinely concerned which was nice however it is what it is and I don't like to be in the position to have to complain :("}
{"text":"Yep it's Subway with subs made your way with your choice of bread which now includes flat bread that is really good.

My hubby took me here for lunch one day while we were out and about running errands around town. He decided to try a flat bread sandwich and let me tell you the bread is fresh and delicious! I think I will try my sandwich on the flat bread next time because that was a real winner!

I usually get the meatball marinara, spicy Italian or veggie delight depending on my mood.

The subs are standard at each Subway, what makes your experience good or bad, hit or miss really depends on the employee behind the counter at the time. There is no real consistency as some employees are more generous then others with the toppings.

It is annoying to have to ask them to add more lettuce or tomato to your sub which is necessary when you can barely see it on your sandwich. On this visit I had to ask for more of everything including purple onion as I kid you not she put 3 little pieces on my FOOT LONG!

I don't know why we continue to visit this location as the service sucks sour balls!. It is the same lady who looks at you as if she has more important duties to do like mop the floors. Which while we dined she was sweeping by our table at our feet. That is a pet peeve of mine, sweeping while I am eating. We were the only damn people in there at the time, she could have waited until we were gone. Well as I have come to realize in life not everyone has common sense.

This particular female employee is consistent in her personality I have to say, she looks and talks as if she is giving a speech at a funeral. She has been there every time we have gone I swear she must be the only employee there. This was our last visit for sure, she just confirmed and made that decision for us. 

Anyhow, there are lots of Subways around town so it will be easy to pass this one up along the way."}
{"text":"I have to admit that this is a little more than the average Subway, but in the end it is still Subway.  And just being above average Subway isn't saying much.

Sub-par portioned meats that are just thrown in the microwave for reheating.

The atmosphere isn't too good with the music screwing around with the poor acoustics of the place, I had had trouble communicating with the order taker to the point of frustration so I just took what I had and left.

The food itself is *sub*-par, perhaps that's why it's called *sub*way.  Hopefully this franchise disappears from existence soon and this location gets replaced with something more worth while."}
{"text":"Nothing against subway sandwiches because lets face facts you get what you pay for and the value is great. 

However, this shop is a (pardon the expression) ghetto nightmare. I entered the store on a Tuesday, November 3rd and was assaulted by cussing that went beyond 4 letter words. While ordering I was subjected to two women arguing behind the counter calling each other names and threatening bodily harm. 

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Not only did I mention to the woman ringing me up that the women were unprofessional but that that type of argument shouldn't take place in front of customers.  Needless to say as I left I had to hear more MF, Bit-hes, Hoe etc.

What a hot mess. On top of that their were several dirty tables, the trash was overflowing and basically it turned me off. I wrote to subway complaining on the same day and NADA!!! No apology, no corporate letter about how this type of behavior is unacceptable in their stores, etc, etc.,"}
{"text":"The level of cross-contamination in this restaurant is disturbing.  I watched the employee making someones sandwich touch multiple utensils, equipment, surfaces, and cash register using the same pair of gloves.  She  used her knuckle to work the register, but that just displayed her level of lazy. She seemed annoyed when I asked if she could change gloves before starting with my food.  

All was well until she went to toast my sandwich.  While she was waiting, she began to touch everything again including her hair.  She knew I was watching and still was touching everything anyway which meant she either didn't care or had no understanding of cross-contamination food safety.  

This location is in desperate need to retraining."}
{"text":"Worst Subway I've ever been to. The young lady taking my order was extremely rude and mentioned twice that she didn't have time for my order because \"she had other customers\"! I was using their drive thru option. I ordered 3 sandwiches and the bread for all 3 was stale and dry. I even had to add my own mayo when I got home because the two small spots she included on my sandwich did not cover nearly the amount for a 6\" sub and the sand which was too dry to eat without it. And passing the open dumpster that was uncovered on the way out was a turn off. I will not be going to this location again."}
{"text":"The first reviewer is right. She wrote her review back in 2015 and it is now 2017 and it's still the same employee and the owner is there next to her helping her out. Worst subway to go to because of the slow and bad service."}
{"text":"Went in this morning to get breakfast for my family and had a horrible experience. First as i arrived i thought the place was closed because their open sign was off and it looked rather dark inside the place. So i decided to get down and see if the were open and they had just forgot to turn their open sign on. Sure enough the were open so that was good but as me and my daughter walked in, we waited at the counter for about 7min before i respectfully reached out and said '' hello'', excuse me anyone here. Finally a young girl by the name of BROOK came from the back and immediately had a attitude as if i was inconveniencing her. So we moved forward and started to place our order and as she was making the two breakfast sandwiches i had ordered i noticed they had a breakfast special for $3.50 that included a 6 inch breakfast sandwich and drink. So i asked Brook about it, and she did say yes that offer is still available, so i said great, lets go ahead and make these two sandwiches i ordered combos for both and she sighed and said okay that's fine with a attitude. So finally as she rings up the bill my daughter asked me if she could get some cookies, so i told BROOK i would like to get a order of oatmeal, meal cookies and a order of chocolate chip as well. So she rang up the order and ended up giving me 2 oatmeal cookies and 1 chocolate chip cookie in a bag and i told her i want 2 orders and she said, well its to late i already rang your order up and i was like OK that's fine no problem even though i couldn't understand why she just wouldn't get me 3 more cookies and charge me for them. Finally she gave me my change back and the bill seem a little high and i just wanted to confirm we got the combos that were listed at $3.50 and she said well i just charged you for the sandwiches and the 3 cookies. Then i replied i ordered the combos right and she said i didnt ring it up that way so no if you want the drinks i can ring those up and charge you for them. I said BROOK you charged me $3.79 per sandwich and the combo was $3.50 that wouldn't make any sense for me to pay for my drinks again when you already over charged me sense we agreed i ordered the combs. I told her i didn't mind she made a mistake and its OK that she charged me a few cents more by ringing it up the way she did, and if was OK for us to still get the drinks and she replied with a major attitude,and said i already told you if you want the drinks i will charge you for them, and i replied BROOK I don't understand I paid you more then the combo cost so can i please get the drinks or can you just re-ring up my order and correct it what ever is easier for you. She finally replied with a major attitude NO, and im not going to continue to argue with you and walked away from me and just went to the back of the store..I ended up just leaving with my daughter and never once got rude,loud, or upset with her. I usually visit this place at least one a week and never had a bad experience like this but i also never had BROOK wait on me either. I don't think i will ever return to this Subway because of BROOKS VERY RUDE DISRESPECTFUL ATTITUDE  that she gives as her customer service. HAVE NEVER been treated so bad at any place of business the way i was treated here at this subway!!! The experience was worse then it may sound. IF ANYONE GOES THEIR WHILE  BROOK IS WORKING, GOOD LUCK!!!!"}
{"text":"I just purchased a Subway tuna sandwich at this location and when I got back to my hotel there was a long 10 inch black hair running through my sandwich??? Don't these people understand you have to wear hairnets Disgusting!!!!

I called the next day to speak to the manager and I told him I was a customer that found a hair in my sandwich and he said I can't hear you ?I can't hear you?? He heard my name but did not want to hear my complaint obviously?"}
{"text":"Our receipt says Tracie, so her name must be Tracie Lol, I just want to say that you for the most amazing subway sandwich ever. I've had this many many times, but I have never felt to satisfied. Excellent service and very nice and polite. The new panini press is amazing, I never had it like this,  and then a second pop into the oven made it even more delicious!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is THE WORST subway EVER.  The food tastes the same as everywhere else, but the service is garbage. Twice in the last 2 weeks I've seen Subway employees get into verbal fights with customers. 

Once because the employee used dirty cloves (she'd touched every surface imaginable while wearing them and then picked up the meat with the same gloves on) to make a sandwich and refused to make a new one for the customer. When the customer politely asked for it to be remade, the employee went crazy on the customer saying, and I quote \"you're about to get on my last nerve b****.\"  The manager did very little to diffuse the situation or apologize to the rest of us in line.  

The second time, the employee got in an argument with my co-worker b/c they never asked him if he wanted his sandwich toasted. When he asked them to toast it, she scrapped all the bread and tuna off the sandwich and then toasted the crumbs that were left. She then put the scooped out mess back on the sandwich while mumbling the whole time about how everyone is a \"f****** problem today.\"

Oh and that same day, they messed up 3 out of the 4 sandwiches ordered in the group before us. 

Safe to say, I'll never go there again even though I love Subway. If you're in this area, go to Tomaydo Tomahhdo.  I'd even recommend the cafeteria in the Galleria before this place."}
{"text":"Employees have deplorable hygiene! Two employees failed to wash their hands (running them under water -with no soap- for 4 seconds then tapping them dry on the sink doesn't count), then touched dirty surfaces (door frames, counters and the computer) while their gloves were on. YUCK! Employee descriptions - overweight, balding white man and short, darker skinned woman. There is no excuse for improper hand washing...this is so basic."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst subways I have ever been to !!! We are semi new to this area and the last two times we went to this location the ladies that work there in the day time are so rude and none caring !! They roll their eyes and have no customer service skills what so ever... They don't even put the right amount of meat on the sandwich and the bread is dried out and doesn't taste good at all... It wasn't even busy and this is the way we were treated BOTH TIMES we went!!I don't suggest going here but that is just my opinion... Horrible customer service and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"On my way to the Switch Data Center for a quick bite with a couple guys before our 12 our work night.  Place was clean but it was empty at 5pm on a Saturday night.  Two fellas behind the counter we ordered one a time.  These guys are sloooow. 
At the end, we ordered 3 foot longs, 3 drinks, and chips.  The same guy that made our subs had to ask me what we ordered!  HUH?  What just happened?  Anyway, subway subs are tasty fresh, but this location has to go if they have people like that working there.  Ill still hit up other subways, just not this one."}
{"text":"SW corner of Cactus & 75th ave. location (Yelp map is incorrect, but the address is correct).  They were staffed well today and the line moved reasonably fast.  Sandwich prep area was clean and the ingredients looked fresh and appetizing.  Bread was fresh, as usual.  Overall food wasn't bad, but wasn't great either - the ususal for Subway.  Cheap food."}
{"text":"Not bad as far as Subways go, clean setup, food tastes typical Subway, parking not bad.  Surprisngly though a lot of riff-raff customers for the area.  /sigh"}
{"text":"Bleh, cold egg sandwich for breakfast?  Whose idea was this, to make a COLD egg breakfast sandwich?

Anyway, seems like a bunch of kids run this place.  Was rather clean though, with decent parking, but man that breakfast is lame."}
{"text":"Consistently good food. And I think the staff there does a great job. Wish they'd start serving breakfast though"}
{"text":"I very rarely leave a 1 star review, but this subway location earned it. I live near this subway. I refuse to go here anymore and will drive clear across anthem to one of the better locations. I've never once got fresh bread here,    and I always feel like the staff here are... not rude but I guess... indifferent... that I'm there. You don't feel like a welcomed customer like you would at most businesses.  The location near Safeway is the best we've got. Go there."}
{"text":"Subways can be hit or miss.  This one is clean and the gals in there are real friendly.  I've been there twice lately.   I didn't get the rotisserie chicken- it looked good but another reviewer said it gave them food poisoning.  That likely came from the distributor, not the store.  There is no raw chicken at subways and I don't think the rotisserie it there.  Anyway, try this sandwich for breakfast: ham, egg, cheese, spinach and black pepper on wheat roll.  Word."}
{"text":"Decent place - much better than a lot of older stores. 
Prices are higher than other locations though. 
And it's always busy so unless you are coming through in an off hour, it's hard to get in and out."}
{"text":"Of all the Subways in the area, the owner op's for much higher prices than suggested by Subway cooperate, or from other local valley owners. 
The service is fair here, but management is so-so. 
Defiantly an older store, it's pretty retro inside."}
{"text":"Above average subway! Quick clean and well made! If in the area would come back!"}
{"text":"Stingy management. Have to ask 3 times for ingredients because they don't put anything on the sandwich. 

Pulled pork special right now and they don't even have it. Also didn't have any spinach or tomatoes. 

As as a sandwich shop, especially subway, stocking ingredients is a key factor. This location fails at that."}
{"text":"Too quote Meghan H, \"The caviar here is just to DIE for\".

Seriously, if you have been to one Subway you have been to them all. I will pass some comments on this location so that they havea  review and feel special. The staff are always very friendly and suually very fast. The seating area is VERY small (maybe its mainly a takeout location?), and the parking is pretty decent as it's a shared lot - but during peak busy times of the day, parking can be tricky. If you have not yet had one, get the steak and cheese on italian herb and cheese bread. Delicious. Decent location adn appears to be well run and very clean.

{"text":"I'm ashamed to admit sometimes I buckle under hunger, time constraints and budget and Eat Fresh. Recently, a book of 10 buy-one-get-one-free coupons made their way into my mailbox, and I was actually a bit excited. Sad, I know. But dollars are dollars and familiar flavours are sometimes nice. 

The people at this location are really nice, and take their sandwich artistry seriously, as one should. They're often out of soups which is a winter bummer, but they have nice bonus toppings like spinach and green olives. 

My go to sub:
+whole wheat
+cold cut trio
+fake white cheese
+lettuce
+green peppers
+black olives
+pickles
+banana peppers
+mayo
+salt and pepper

Go on. Copy me. It's delicious."}

I know this is a review for one of the largest franchised chains in the world, heck it might even be the largest, so I'm not going to lose my head and give it more than three stars... but I am tempted. This location is right by Christie Pits meaning it basically has one of Toronto's nicest patios.

A go-to subway sandwich says a lot about a person, so I'm going to tell you mine. That's right, here is a look into my sell-out soul:

{"text":"Personally I am not the biggest fan of Subway, but with their $5 foot long sandwich specials, they have me coming through the door more often then not. 

Other then the $5 specials, their location and generally lack of a line, this is a pretty solid place to go for a decent build it yourself (or more of you tell them to build it) sandwich."}
{"text":"This Subway has to have the friendliest staff I have ever met.  They even compensate your sandwiches for little things.  For example, I may only ask for 2 cheese slices, and they will give a little extra meat to make up for it.  They always load it with ton of fresh veggies.  The establishment is well-kept and clean whenever I have gone.  The Subway night deal ended at the end of 2010, and it is now only limited to a few sandwiches.  I wasn't aware of this change, but I still the regular deal for my Veggie Patty sandwich.  Subway is a healthy choice, and I come here often."}
{"text":"Subway is usually my fast food go to, but this location has lead me to take a break from eating there. I ordered the exact same thing I always get and it just tasted funky. The meat almost tasted smoky. Maybe that was intentional, but it was not good. There was a pretty decent lunch crowd, but it moved quick. Honestly though, the service here is what put me off most. While I was waiting in line, there was a gentleman getting up from dining in and one of the workers started SCREAMING at him telling him to \"get a napkin and go clean up your crumbs off the table.\" It was very uncomfortable and she continued to make a scene about it even after he left. I will be avoiding this location."}
{"text":"Not all Subways are the same! This is my favorite one in town. The staff is always very friendly and most importantly.. SUPER EFFICIENT! There is always a line, but I have never been there more than a few minutes. Their ability to multi-task is very impressive. And they do a great job about giving you the right proportions of toppings. I am surprised to see comments about the owner, because I have always had a particular pleasant experience with him."}
{"text":"This Subway use to be fantastic! Over the last few weeks it has gotten to the point of aggravation to eat here!

I work in the same shopping complex, eating at Subway is convenient. However, todays experience aggravated me to the point of getting upset. The inept hospitality and speed of there staff is mind boggling!!! 

I walked over today, approached the counter with zero line. I asked for a 6\" Sandwich. My order was confirmed with an eye roll of annoyance by the worker. I proceeded to ask for a toasted sandwich. The two people behind me ordered 6\" tuna sandwiches.  These sandwiches we prepared before mine, while my sandwich sat on the counter, GETTING COLD! After this point, my sandwich was prepped to be finished, upon asking for salt & pepper and Oregano, SO MUCH WAS USED THAT IT MADE MY SANDWICH BARLEY EDIABLE!!!! Thirdly I asked for Avocado on my sandwich, I have never seen such poor cutting skills EVER! I paid to have piece not slivers of avocado. 

To add insult to injury the cutting knife was cleaned on the parchment that my sandwich was being prepped on, HELLO CROSS CONTAMINATION!!! 

If you are wanting to eat here for lunch, give yourself extra time & make sure you don't have an expectation of how your food should look or taste. 

Thankfully, I had a coupon for a 6' sandwich so I didn't pay for this experience!"}
{"text":"Subway always seems to be a hit or miss. Your experience depends on the last time you ate Subway, how much you want Subway at the moment, what you decide to put on your sandwich, the always different service, and the execution of the sandwich.
I've been to this location since I was little, and it hasn't changed much expect the employees. Usually, the service isn't the problem. It's the sandwich. Sometimes the bread isn't working, it's toasted too much, or I ruin my experience by forgetting to ask for a veggie or sauce.
Yet overall, I like the taste of Subway. I always get their Black Forest ham or the club (always). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. I'm always in and out when I come in. However , they are not open until 2 am (per Yelp) nevertheless open 24 hours (Per google maps). They close @ 10 pm as advised by the staff. Management needs to fix hours of operation listed online. Also, cookies were a little to hard.  Defiantly seems like they were from overnight or something."}
{"text":"I went in the night before inventory, and heard the employees talking what to fill and not fill because of inventory. When I told them what I wanted on my sub they were almost if spinach , which is the best part of my sub. The employee scrape the bin of spinach including the nasty slimy bits. I asked for fresh spinach and she claimed they were completely out. That's kind of hard to believe when you just heard the staff not wanting to fill up their supplies Bc on their inventory.... I won't go back because clearly they don't want my money"}

{"text":"This place is decent I've been coming here for years. But today one of the employees named JD was seemingly really pissed off that I ordered 3 sandwiches. There was only one person in front of me ordering one sandwich and no one behind me. Someone hates their job and is making it very clear to customers. He was even slamming all of the lids to the fixings and slamming the bread on the table haha!"}

{"text":"Stumbled into here late one Friday after moving loads and loads of stuff (yes, slowly becoming a hoarder) but I've always passed by this place and never really had a chance to eat here.  A Subway is a Subway - and there are pretty much no surprises.  

The nice thing about this location is that it is a stand alone building.  I'm used to seeing Subways in strip malls.  That being said, there is plenty of parking, some outdoor seating (which is a plus) and a nice large dining area.

The sandwich artists seemed to be on their last leg of their shifts, but they were friendly enough.  I did want to eat there and take a break from moving, but the guy must have been in a daze cause he put the sandwich in a to-go bag and then realized what he did... put the bag on a tray.  We had a good laugh about it, but not a show-stopper for me."}
{"text":"Excited to see this Subway open up at the corner of Lawyers and Stevens Mill.  Not your typical set up here... they have the \"corner office\" set up with a lot of space for seating and a nice outdoor patio.  I am used to the subways that are located in tight, cramp spots in strip malls but this is a nice change.

Also noticed that they are serving coffees and lattes too...  I'll have to check it out next time I stop by.  

The servers were very friendly and quick.  The store was very clean and well maintained.  I like how the bread oven (usually is in rough shape since they bake their bread fresh every day) was still clean and prestine.  Hopefully they can keep that level up."}
{"text":"I've been to my share of subway locations so this one is fairly close to my house, but it is in the same shopping center as Walmart off of Sardis which I try to avoid like the plague, but I found myself here the other day wanting a quick footlong sub for dinner.

The 'sandwich artists' were friendly and got me in and out within minutes so I can't fault them for that.  They did seem a little distracted by a side conversation they had going on, but it only delayed be about a minute more than it would have - it just bothers me when you are mid list of toppings and you get cut off and then have to repeat yourself even though you said it very nicely the first time."}
{"text":"Subway in my neck of the woods....  I would go here more often for lunch, but I don't work around Matthews unfortunately.  This Subway is kept clean and the sandwich artists are very friendly (as most Subway locations are).  Most of my visits here at this location have been in the evenings for a quick dinner.  This location shares the parking lot for the Monterrey's and the Outback Steakhouse... so the parking lot can get fairly busy, but with Subway, you are usually in and out while people wait on tables at Outback."}
{"text":"Recently had a footlong at this location.  Usually I go into Subway and get the Veggie Delight, but I treated myself to a Turkey Breast and Black Forrest Ham footlong on wheat. (I had run a 15K in the morning so I was looking to replenish some of my body's food stores).

This location is really tucked into the shopping center and could easily be missed.  It feel's a little like a \"high end\" subway in it's decor (could be a combination of its location and clientèle) 

As always the Sandwich Artist was okay and created my sandwich as requested.  The subway wasn't very busy and it was around 1pm, but I felt a small attitude from the server, but he could have been having a bad day.

I'll come back to this location since it's near one of my friend's apartment."}
{"text":"I went to this Subway Friday night, 8/18 and stood in the store for 5 min alone....no customers, no staff, nothing. Worried that maybe there was a robbery or something, I began asking loudly, \"hello, is anyone around\"? I left & drove around the back of the store, around the corner from the tattoo place & there was the staff in the alley, looking at their cell phones. I sat there for several minutes before they went in. Mr. Owner...you're losing allot if $$ here. Appalling..."}
{"text":"Awesome service! The manager is always awesome! My office just placed a last minute catering order - not giving the requested 24hr notice - and they totally said they could do it! really helped me out in a bind!! thanks!!! youre the best!"}
{"text":"I used to go there some time ago but the owners are super stingy on toppings. People never smile. Over time I got fed up and went to the Subway at square one, when they were on the 2nd floor. MUCH better.

 I didn't know they didn't take coupons, well this is what I keep seeing in reviews, how cheap. Why do people continue to support this location? It is close to people who work there and don't mind having sub-par service and a lousy sub."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up a sandwich because I forgot
My lunch for work. While they weren't super busy, they were somewhat busy. What got me was how unbelievable rude the employee was. Her name is Laurie and she was rude from start to finish. When I couldn't understand a question and asked
Her to repeat she literally rolled her eyes at me. Then when the gift card didn't work on the scan function, I handed it to her, and asked her to see if she could get it to work. She threw it away!!!!! My final straw was when she rolled her eyes again when I told her she needed to get it back. She even refused at first to give me her name. This employee alone ruined the experience."}

{"text":"This is the location inside Scottsdale Fashion Square in the food court.
Was here today shortly before noon,it wasn't crowded,in fact no one was in line at all and I wondered if I was their first customer of the day.
My reciept indicates I was the 38th sale rung so they'd had a few patrons prior to me.
The lady that started me off was very nice.Cheerful greeting me and such.As my sandwich moved down the line,the scenario changed drasticly.The guy who finshed making the sandwich was more than transparent in his hatred for being there and his distain towards me.He literally threw the ingredients and dressings on and all over the sandwich,bread,paper it was in,making it just a mess.He glared at me the whole time as if I killed his family and their cat.Now mind you,there was no precidence to this behavoir whatsoever.I certainly didn't bark my request at any of them,nor was I short,dismissive or abusive in any manner.I have much Respect for those forced to work retail/fast food etc as they are truly crappy jobs so I am always sure not to be their angry,snotty,unpleasant customer.
So now I'm on to pay.The next guy I get is equally non plussed and on the verge of anger as he mumbles something and rings me up.He proceeds to put the wrapped sandwich in the plastic bag,shove it across the counter at me as he throws my change on the counter.Never making any eye contact.
I feel bad for the lady who was stuck with these two disgruntled jackasses.
Remember emo bois...It's down,not across....
I filled out the survey on Subway's website but am not interested in their free cookie for doing so."}
{"text":"It's subway! The food is fresh and it taste exactly the same time after time, which is why I keep going back!

Sure sometimes when I go in the store the employees are in the back room talking but when  it's time to make my sandwich ... They get right to it! After all I didn't come to subway to be treated like a queen ... I came in for my $5.50 footlong! 

The menu rarely changes so thankfully I have never had a problem getting my order through.. ' oven roasted chicken breast , provolone cheese , yes toasted please, lettuce, onion, cucumber , banana peppers, oil and vinegar no combo thank you! 

Location is usually clean and looking good since it's relatively new, it's never too too busy and it's fast!

See you soon subway!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Subway that I have ever patronized. It was horrible on so many levels.
1. I ordered a foot long Subway club on Italian herbs & cheese. I noticed that the girl put two slices of mangled, razor thin roast beef on the entire foot long. I asked what happened to the other two slices and she claimed that they were cutting back. Therefore, I asked for double RB and she added two more small razor thin slices.
2. I was very polite, yet she was extremely rude to me during the exchange. After she put the meat and cheese on she went in the back and I never saw her again.
3. The guy finished out my sandwich and proceeded to charge me three extra dollars for two razor thin slices of crappy roast beef. My total cost was nearly $14 for a foot-long with little meat.
4. I got home and realized that the rude girl had made my sandwich on white bread. The sandwich tasted like crap BTW. Maybe her magenta hair had killed too many of her brain cells.

I never write reviews about fast food chains but my god this was the worst Subway I've  ever been to. Stay away!!!!!!"}

{"text":"I love that this location has a DRIVE-THRU!!! I will admit that I didn't order a sandwich, but went through the drive-thru for some cookies. Subway cookies are my favorite and when that sweet tooth craving hits, they always deliver and hit the spot! I am giving this location 5 stars because the cookies I got were cooked PERFECTLY! I highly recommended the white chocolate macadamia nut cookies. Other locations seem to undercook or overcook them. The woman working the window was also very friendly."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous two reviewers. I've shown up here 5 times for breakfast after my 10 AM class ~around 10:53... every time except for once when they had a pretty reasonable employee, the people here have come up with some lame excuse to avoid making me a breakfast sub. (Breakfast subs are available from 7-11)

Silvermine next door is so much better."}
{"text":"I showed up here when they were supposed to open at 7AM for breakfast but they didn't open till 7:08. I asked for a toasted breakfast sub with Black Forest Ham, American cheese, their yellow Egg concoction (about a week old usually), onions, cucumber, and peppers. 

I keep forgetting that subway American cheese is white, I should have just gotten their cheddar.

The toasting was poorly done and the customer service was pretty bad. Needless to say I'm not impressed, in fact -to help potential patrons: I'd like to let you all know that the juices in store cost $1.49-$3.15 but you can get more variety juices from the vending machines for $1.25."}
{"text":"I grab tuna and veggie subs from Subway several times a week. Quick. Easy. Basic (somewhat) healthy food. The subs at this particular restaurant are fine... its the service that bothers me. 

I am a customer. I have money. I am in the store to buy a foot long sandwich. I might even leave a tip in the plastic container by the register. 

I begin the transaction by saying \"Hi!\"  No response.  She stares at me with a disgusted look on her face. I place my order.  No response. She begins making my sandwich. No response. I ask for a few more black olives. No response. I place a bag of chips on the counter. No response. I hand her my debit card. No response. I Say \"thank you... have a good day....\" No response. 

This woman should NOT be working with customers.  I am not trying to get her fired.... but on a scale of 1 to 10 for customer service.... this store gets a negative number.  I will NEVER return to this Subway location again. 

I am over poor customer service.  If you don't like your job... quit!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly although they I watched one girl commit a health code violation by putting olives back into the tray that had been fallen off someone's sandwich. Now the taste wasn't great, the avocado doesn't taste fresh. The Bacon doesn't have any taste. All in all, one of the reasons I stopped going to Subway."}

{"text":"So this is a new-er subway because it used to be a Starbucks while I was in high school. I come here every so often because I love subway. But this review solely goes for my visit last night after midnight. We originally wanted to get Faustos, but it was closed. I'm glad we ended up at Subway because we stumbled upon some awesome awesome service by an awesome person. Oh, and I learned how to finally pay by apple phone, which is really amazing by the way...wish you were there to see my reaction, lol.


I've been in the food industry so I completely understand when it comes to being the only one working. It was after midnight so usually it takes more time to get things done especially when there are more than 1 guest in the place. Well, we came in and there was another girl ordering two sandwiches and we didn't mind at all. We knew it was going to take a bit, most people would just walk out and go somewhere else. He was super sweet to her and I he also acknowledged that he would be right with us. 

When it was our turn he first washed his hands (that's good because you notice a lot of  people don't do that) and helped out with the menu because I had a few questions. I got a white flat bread with tomato sauce, pepperoni, provolone and mozzarella cheese, toasted, with extra banana peppers. And well, he filled that sucker up with everything! It was like a little pizza sandwich which I really enjoyed. When I said extra, he really put some lovin' into it, and I was really happy. That's how you do it. Make your customers happy. My boyfriend got the oven roasted chicken with a bunch of veggies (and fresh veggies at that) and he was definitely very generous with his sandwich as well.

Time to pay and this guy was just really sweet. I told him since I had never tried apple pay with the little monitor thing that I wanted to try it. He was helpful with that and within a second my food was paid for. Shocked because that was a lot faster than taking out my card and putting in the chip in and waiting for it to approve and say \"remove card\" which takes forever by the way. Hoping many other places consider having an apple pay reader.

Well, I was completely satisfied with this visit and I felt like he deserved a darn well good review because a lot of people don't recognize this kind of service. On the receipt it said Jacob, but I think the kids that came in after us said John cause they knew him from High School... but whoever you are, thank you for making our night a happy and full one."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of going into this subway just 20 minutes ago... As I walk in I was greated by an elderly middle eastern that had food in his mouth. I wait my turn and the elderly man hops up and runs behind the counter with food of some sort still on his cheek. He grabs my bread and cheese then wipes the food from his cheek then grabs my meat... Not pleased... He throws the meat on the sandwich and slides it to the next guy. I tell the guy I want onions and lots of olives. He sprinkles onions and puts on about 8 slices of olives on my foot long. I ask for more.  He puts on two more slices... I say \"sir, I will pay for extra olives and I'm fine with that. But, I want extra olives!\" He responds \"I can't man.\" Then nods to the elderly guy... I never imagined I would live to see the day that black olives were such a coveted resource that I would be unable to attain them with American currency!  Accepting defeat I pay for my foot long only to be able to gain the contact information on this specific Subway. But on the bright I am excited because apparently the cans of black olives in my pantry are so valuable that I might be able to sell them and buy my own subway!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. I only get 30mins for lunch. And I was 3rd in line I stood there no more then 2mins and had my food less then 5 min. It got busy as I was sitting here eating my lunch. And the 3 staff members kept smiling and pushing out the o rders fast. Thank you for lunch."}
{"text":"Once I learned that they do not open until 7am, then everything seemingly got better. I never found out who that girl was that told me to hold on, as I have never seen a girl working there. 

However, the key for success at this location is not going through the drive thru but instead of going inside the gas station and going to the counter.

Service has been good, steady and fast on my last few visits."}
{"text":"Whomever owns this place must be richer than Jared, because this place is packed with my fellow Cleveland-Marshall law students during lunchtime every day. Needless to say, I don't go then, and unless you want to spend your whole lunch break in a line, you shouldn't either. I do go on non-peak hours though, because nothing beats a toasted footlong Spicy Italian, and they serve 'em up great here.

This is one of the better Subways around--the service tends to be pretty fast, most of the people are pretty friendly, and during non-peak hours there's rarely a line. There used to be problems finding places to park, but now that the city put meters on the street right next to it, you can pull right up and get your sandwich."}
{"text":"A nice and shiny Subway, this location is fairly new. But the sandwich making techniques are tried and tested.
Pick your bread, meat, cheese, \"would you like that toasted\", now on with the veggies, sauces, seasoning. Would you like to make that a combo with chips and a drink?
Thank you and come again.
Oh, watch your step."}
{"text":"It's Subway. The Ford of sandwiches, where everything is made on an assembly line.

This location is smaller and a little rundown looking inside. There are 4 or 5 cameras tacked onto the ceiling and 1 is just dangling there.
But, otherwise it's a the same product that we all know and love, assuming you love Subway. The staff are all nice, but they can get a little overwhelmed with the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I LOVE subway... Just like the others except it smells new, looks beautiful, and the employees are still learning and a bit slow :-)"}
{"text":"Yeah, not that great. I went there for the first time today for a veggie patty sub. There was a guy training but he didn't serve me. The other man burnt my sandwich twice and then tried to serve it to me. They were friendly but the food is the most important."}
{"text":"I love subway and it's usually pretty cool but this time I felt kind of off. That guy Armondo or whatever yelled at his employee when he didn't even seem to have done anything wrong. I just felt as if it was very unprofessional of him to do so. The sandwiches taste good tho! I hate that what could've been a great meal was only okay due to this bully. Julian was nice. Will return to subway again but most likely not this one"}
{"text":"I like Subway!  They have come quite a ways from when I first started eating at Subways in general.  They now have many bread options from wheat, cheddar and white, flat bread plus some others.  I like the $5 options that you can get here and some footlongs sandwiches are less than $5.  I can eat a 1/2 a foot long for lunch and the rest for dinner!  So great value!

Fresh baked bread, toppings and cookies are always good choices.  

If you want to skip the bread, you can always get a salad!

This location always seems clean and the employees are friendly!  When I've gone here there hasn't been too many people so service has been fast too!"}
{"text":"One of the better Subways that I have been too.  Bread was fresh.  They didn't skimp on the toppings either.  That is my favorite part!  Staff was friendly and the place was clean!"}
{"text":"If you're a foodie as I am, you've eaten your share of gristle. It goes with the territory. Eating the flesh of a deceased animal means ingesting the odd bit of connective tissue, cartilage or fibrous joint gristle.

But when a person goes to Subway for a sandwich there is an unspoken agreement that the food will be harmless and fill the void. These teen-aged sandwich people are in the business of glopping wet meatballs or chicken shards onto a mini loaf of pre-frozen bread, reluctantly applying veggies,and slathering a condiment of choice. The end product is given over for consumption wrapped like a shrouded corpse.

So, think of me, defenses down, coughing out a wad of gristle that had been nestled within a meatball. I set the sandwich down next to me on the table and stopped everything. The deal was off. I no longer could trust the sandwich to be harmless or filling. An obscenity had marred the ocassion and I dissected the rest of my meatball sandwich. It wasn't fresh or appetizing; it emoted sadness to me. 

This was a sad sandwich and if it could talk it might speak sadly to me. Sad words. It made me sad to think of this lonely sandwich from this dirty place hoping for better. 

It was then that I reassembled my meatball sandwich and ate it. It is in a better place now. I am as well.

I had a cookie too and after a few bites it got good to me. I didn't drink a soda and that's just as well, what with the flies and all."}
{"text":"This place opened up right down the street from my job and so far so good. They took over an old Quiznos and didn't change too much of the inside. You can tell they're a newer subway. The staff is generally pretty nice and effective, the only time I have issues is when I'm ordering multiple sandwiches at a time, then things start to go screwy. One major plus I'll give them is that the vegetables are always fresh and while not overly liberal, they have no problem filling the sandwich with veggies if you ask, which are the two major things I don't like about most locations. Overall, I like this experience more than most subways, so kudos there"}
{"text":"This store is disgusting!  I just left this store my friend ordered a tuna sandwich the Asian guy asked him 4 times if he wanted cheese?  Not sure if there was a language barrier.  But the same knife he cut The bread with he then mashed the tuna into the bread with it.  When he was done he cut his sandwich all with same knife.   He went to make my sandwich which was not a tuna sandwich and was about to cut the bread with that same  dirty knife.  I asked him if he could use a clean knife I was not having tuna and didn't want my food been cross contaminated and potentially get food poising.  He gave me a big attitude walked in the back and literally left me standing there for several minutes then he came out of the back with the same knife wiping it off with the a subway napkin?  I told him will just take the one sandwich he already made paid and left.  I went down the block to port of subs and got my lunch there.  I will never go back to this store.  Service has always been terrible now it's just disgusting and dangerous to your health.  No thanks!"}
{"text":"Well- it's a subway. So the the standard sandwiches and services apply. I have never had bad service or food here- but the restaurant down on 43rd ave and Bell is generally cleaner, and the staff is a bit more friendly and outgoing."}
{"text":"The first employee was SUPER friendly and welcoming,  the manager on duty that does the ringing out and toppings. Not.
When I asked for olives, got 4. 4 pickles. Not kidding. Asked for extra, and got a WHOLE FOUR MORE.
No smile. No eye contact, not rude but not welcoming. 
So won't be spending my lunch dollars here again.
Upside, clean place and very standard Subway. Just the manager was a piece of work. I mean it's Subway, and I get that. But to make it palatable, toppings are needed."}
{"text":"Normal subway ,but the workers were very friendly and conversational and helpful. Also the place was quite clean for a fast food restraint and the place was completely empty."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, rude employees! I won't be back!! Too bad because the food is generally good. The owner needs to do some training with the staff."}
{"text":"Just went in a purchased a 6inch tuna melt with two cookies. Before I even get out of the parking lot I found a very long strand of black hair ties within my sandwich and wrapped around the bottom. My husband went in to get a refund. They acted like they could care less. They didn't know how to refund and so that took a couple of minutes and then threatened not to refund the cookies LIKE WHY WOULD I WANT TO EAT ANYTHING FROM HERE. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK. They finally gave him the refund after laughing among themselves and speaking in Spanish. No apology at all. Never coming here again. Would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Subway is decent for a quick and easy nosh.  I always get a turkey with spinach on wheat (now without yoga mat!) and it's a good light dinner.  The food is fresher than most fast food which is good and the low price is even better."}
{"text":"Subway is pretty much the McDonald's of cheap sandwiches.  You know you will get the same thing the same way at every single location.  The food is consistently good - they train the \"sandwich artists\" well. You can usually count on it being consistent and fresh.  The staff is not ignorant and they are always pleasant and courteous considering they are making insanely low wages.  I love that you can now get quacamole (with a kick!) To your sandwich instead of oil or dressing. Super food! Yum.  I really like and appreciate the breads being fresh and how that makes the place smell great.  I feel like the salads are nowhere near as good as the sandwiches.  Hate the Pepsi products.  Sometimes they throw out the brewed too early so that is not an option.  The cookies are tasty."}
{"text":"It was easy to grab some sandwiches on the way out to the desert to watch the meteor shower.  The food is always consistent at Subway - you know what you are getting.  The sub was easy to eat and tasted good.  This place used to be a Church's chicken back in the day but then became a Subway.  Seems clean and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Guy with the red goatee took 10 minutes to put my blt in on the computer and on top of it I had to leave to drive all the way to my bank atm just to get money out because their card machine didn't work. What a joke."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, and efficient...a little too efficient. I know it's a silly complaint to have but the sandwhich artists are so fast and they have roughly 5-6 people behind the small counter (or the register is slow) that it makes it incredibly awkward when you're at the beginning bread station and you're having to yell over another customer's shoulder because your sandwich is at the other end by the condiments. I wanted to try some new toppings on several occasions but the checkout line is always slow and when I asked the guy to wait until I could get closer to actually see what they had he looked impatient and antsy so I always just end up spouting off random ingredients from memory, kind of a bummer and hate being rushed like that."}
{"text":"I've always love Subway,,it's very affordable and they have real good food. And you can choose whatever you wanna put in your sandwich. I am more than satisfied"}
{"text":"I have no complaints with this Subway. I've eaten here a handful of times now as I work very close, and each time has been just fine. 

The Subway shares a building with the BP, so occasionally parking can be tight. The lot isn't large enough to accommodate the two separate businesses. 

Other than that, though, this is just your average Subway, offering all the same deliciousness you would find at any stand-alone Subway. There's even a little seating area within the building and a couple tables outside."}
{"text":"Awful! Disgusting!!! We are eating and they are slamming chairs and tables, sweeping and MOPPING under my table!  Never come here again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the most consistently good Subway that I've been to. I've worked about 2 miles away for 10 years. The bread is always soft and fresh and the veggies look fresh cut. The manager here is always super nice, as are the employees. It seems like the people that work there take pride in the restaurant."}
{"text":"You know....what do you say about Subway? I mean the bread all tastes the same and meat and cheese is just \"OK\". It's cheap....I guess that is what you say. 

Other than just general jabs at Subway this particular one is close to work, so I go there often. The people aren't overly friendly but they are fast and will get you in and out and there is something to be said for that. 

So I give them an extra Star for being fast and no nonsense when it comes to making my foot long roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"My mom is older so she doesn't really use computers and she asked me to write a review based on her experience. \"I went through the drive-through and then offered to go inside to correct my order. Inside, Ronnie waited on me and he was very efficient, effective and friendly in getting my order right. The shop was extremely busy as was the drive through and he effectively prioritized and gave great customer service that I much appreciated. The team was great even under pressure.\""}
{"text":"This location was pretty standard. The service was quick, the employees were friendly, and the restaurant was pretty clean. I thought they didn't give super solid portions of the toppings, but they weren't too skimpy."}
{"text":"This place is perpetually filthy. The servers wear flip flops. It's disgusting."}
{"text":"tl;dr Food was excellent, service was exceptionally slow. Food: 4 stars, Service: 2 stars

I ordered a $5 spicy Italian, which was excellent. I would eat this sandwich again in a small penguin's heartbeat, and penguins have small hearts so I have to bet they beat pretty fast.

Now, the service was exceptionally slow. Two employees were manning the station with 7 people in line, but neither employee was hurried. They took time to open new packages of food and straighten the cashier counter. They switched customers mid-sandwich for no reason and confused themselves. I can barely describe just how slow the service was. I reconsidered my life. I reconsidered the decisions that I made leading up to my choice to get a sandwich here. I should have walked to Harris Teeter."}
{"text":"There Italian herb & cheese bread is ALWAYS so under cooked. It's not suppose to look like white bread with Orange lines"}
{"text":"Oh, I get it. It's 8:30 on a Saturday morning and you don't want to work. So you take it out one the five customers who come in to order. Then proceed to make a lackluster sandwich. Skimpy toppings and you smooshed my bacon.  If this didn't help to prolong my tubing adventure I'd only give you one star. Disqualified!"}
{"text":"I'm not a Subway fan, but this is where we go for lunch before heading off to the river for tubing. The flatbread wasn't terrible, but it was a bit dry. The veggies were fresh. We arrived shortly before their opening hours and were able to get in and get our subs in a short amount of time."}
{"text":"First, I have to say that this is apparently a very busy Subway. I was trying to call in an order and it took several times to get through to a person. The bank for which I work is a cosponsor of Habitat for Humanity and we needed some place close to the site for lunch over the past weekend. We were very pleased with the results. 

We ordered four party trays, three with assorted meats and wheat and white breads, and one veggie tray. I only had the meat but it was filling and tasted good. The other volunteers in our party appreciated the meatless option. This location actually gave us squeeze bottles with the mayo and mustard in them, which made me feel like a sandwich artist. 

I appreciated the honestly of the employees here. I was told a more cost-effective option than getting the assorted bags of chips through the store was to pick them up at Costco. They easily could have just taken that portion of the order without providing an alternative. Thumbs way up! 

We have another Habitat event in April and this will be my first choice for our lunch."}
{"text":"Very rude employees. They supposedly serve breakfast until 11 and when we tried to order breakfast at 10:55 they rudely refused. Will not go back to this subway."}
{"text":"Wow... this place is sheisty... They did a brother wrong on the #TMobileTuesday hookup at this location. Not going to go too much into details but the customer service was a poor attempt of professionalism. Highly disappointed visit."}
{"text":"Carlos is the best! I love Subway but this is the best place to get a sub. We love coming here for lunch! Love the customer service, the best sandwiches and the fastest service without sacrificing taste!"}
{"text":"The girl working the counter didn't have a name tag on, slightly overweight teen, proceeded to stop making my order and yell to her friend \"you always come at the worst time, next time come at 8!\" Then, gives her friend a handful of cookies (m&m, her friends choice) then goes back to making our order- overcharges me but wait, can't give me a receipt because \"we don't got no receipts\" WTF! This subway keeps placing teens in charge of the night shift when they have no self respect much less regard for their customers! You are representing a bigger picture! SMH"}
{"text":"This is the Subway in the Providence district. They set it up exclusively for the residents of this community. It's also my  favorite Subway in LV.  It's worth the trip over here. The guy who makes the sandwiches here acts like a sushi chef. He literally folds the meat in an artistic style and presents it all impressive looking. My sandwich today looked better than something your would find at \"Sushi Imagine\" or \"Kabuto\". It was the coolest thing I had ever seen."}
{"text":"This Subway is the worst in Oakville. Not only do they skimp on their toppings, they are rude! We thought we'd give them one last chance tonight, so we headed there at 9:00pm. Their sign with their hours, times here on Yelp and times on Google say they are open until 10:00pm. 

Their open sign was on, so imagine our surprise when they were closed. The worker was still inside, and he yelled through the door they closed at 9pm. My Husband pointed out their own store hours on the door which stated 10pm. The guy shook his head and reiterated they closed at 9 and then proceeded to shut off the open sign. That was the last straw - we won't be back."}
{"text":"Would give zero if I could.  Every time I come here there is one or two people working and it takes absolutely forever to order or get your food and if there is a line of at least two people just leave.  I will never try this location again.  Sad as I live  5 min away.  Obviously these restaurants have forgot how to manage a business and to treat customers.  If I wanted to wait 30 min I would go to a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"This subway franchise doesn't participate in Corporate Subway promotions. Their price of the sandwiches are inflated at least 25%. Now if you have the Circus Circus Player's Club Card you cannot use your points here. Customer service is dismal. This has to be the worst Subway in Las Vegas inside the worst MGM property that they own. MGM really should sell this property like yesterday."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. They didn't greet me or were friendly at all. A worker named Karla made my sandwich with the worst attitude ever. The food itself was a joke. The bread and veggies were dry. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Love this Subway!  The store is bright, clean, and welcoming.  Every employee I've interacted with there during the past 3 years that I've lived in Avon Lake, has been nice and accommodating.  They seem to actually WANT to be working there and take pride in making the customers happy.  Each tasty sammich is crafted with love and care, and the toppings aren't just thrown on haphazardly like other places.   There's some franchises where the workers don't even smile or just have that \"I don't wanna be here\" attitude.  My friend Shay once told me about her experience at a Detroit-area Subway:  \"That bitch murdered my sammich!\"  You'll never have to worry about that happening here! This is not one of those crazy places.
The Subway in the Promenade in Westlake is also a good place with nice people if you're out that way.

Stop in and have a bite!"}
{"text":"The Subway at The Promenade is pretty tiny, but I've never had any issues with the food or service. Bread and veggies are crisp and fresh and the employees assemble your sammich with care. They'll have you in and out in a jiffy!

The restaurant is clean and smells good. Stop on in if you're craving a footlong, salad, or even some cookies."}
{"text":"wow for a subway just horrible I wasn't expecting much its a subway not quizno's. but really food was hardly edible. Had a blue cheese salad and a sandwich witch I had about a bite then couldn't eat the rest. Shame but oh well.I will give it one star for being clean and stocked but yea .."}
{"text":"Just walked in three people working or should say one was the other I cannot tell you. Took 10 min to get served some lady walks in do not know if she was the owner but come in with a bad attitude walks in the back with bread and almost knocks me over I will not go back here plus they had only a few bread choices"}
{"text":"Rude, immature, and unprofessional behavior. My child is disabled and he couldn't make up his mind on what he wanted to eat. One employee kept turning his head toward his friend to laugh at us and then they would both laugh..This happened two times.. I finally said we will go some where else since you both want to laugh at us. As we walked out one of them yelled out sarcastically \"have a nice day\" I then went up to the subway on eastern and horizon and got great service.. I will take all my business to this other location from now on..If I could have given no stars I would have. Nice way to treat your customers"}
{"text":"We are regulars here, but not after 4/6/17. 
The big one with the horse mouth that looks like Miss Piggy after two weeks in Jamaica is the primary reason.

She is an abnormal looking piglet. She rushes the customers and is very demanding.

Youll know her right away and she is a most nasty beastly specimen.

She looks like someone tried to clone Bigfoot with a Pig."}
{"text":"If you don't no Spanish you're basically screwed. I couldn't understand an effing thing from these people. They had such a thick Spanish accent I had to of said what 20 times and they got everything wrong starting over twice completely. They couldn't understand me nor them. I'll never go to that place again."}
{"text":"Sandwich was cool. Lady was super rude. I asked for a napkin and she referred me back to my tray that she DID NOT put napkins on. I told her I didn't get any and she had hella attitude..
Then I opened my chip back and I seemed to have gotten a defective one that had more crumb and seasoning than actual chips. Again, hella attitude and asked for the bad bag back just so she can throw it on the counter behind her and roll her eyes at me. Probably won't be coming back to this location again. First and last visit."}
{"text":"Judging by the other reviews for this Subway I'm glad I didn't purchase anything. 
I just needed to make an emergency pit stop and was turned away because I didn't buy anything. I held my temper and my urine till I got home 45 min away! Ran a couple red lights but made it safely home. Yes sir!
Boooo to Subway!"}
{"text":"How do rate these places?..food is basically the same...out of all the subways, this location has great staff..very friendly, fast, helpful and go the extra mile...
Manager needs to know his service providers are awesome... Wished we could tip on Credit card..get with the times Mr Manager..."}
{"text":"I have been pondering this review for a while but finally think it's time. I visit this location from time to time to grab a quick bite. The staff seem less than enthused to be working. They quickly fix a sandwich but none of them ever do it the same way. I think that consistency is key but not here. Also, when I ask for a sub to be toasted I would like it to be hot when I consume it. I think this place is fine for a quick bit but if you looking for some conversation and consistency this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"I've had a love/hate relationship with Subway for years - my opinion varies wildly depending on the location, but this is one of the good ones ! 

Very Clean restaurant however the employees always look like they are so sad. They do a good job but some have the attitude, if it wasn't for the customer we would have a great job."}
{"text":"Fast and convenient. People working here are sweet and hard-working. Get your flat bread extra toasted as I think at this time, they are a little tyke under-cooked."}
{"text":"They have the rush hour crowd down to a T.  The line was out the door but it moved swiftly.  It was Friday (during Lent) so I ordered a tuna sandwich.  For whatever reason, it didn't taste as good as I last remembered (it's been a while since I've been to Subway).  They were friendly there even though they had to move fast, but unfortunately, it just didn't taste good."}
{"text":"We came in and tried the new footlong pastrami sandwich. It is awesome and the service was outstanding. Give him a try the prices are also very good"}
{"text":"A basic Subway location, although I try to avoid it when I can. The employees are nice but they often have trouble with some of their clientele which can often make it unpleasant inside.

The location is hit or miss."}
{"text":"This is a very basic Subway location, except it shares a space with Wienershnitzel. That was pretty weird. We wanted to grab a quick bite in the area to take to the drive-in with us and were trying to get something a little healthier than the typical fast food options. Service was basic and quick. We'll probably be back when we come to the drive-in again."}
{"text":"This is a typical Subway. I frequent it because it is close to my house. They are efficient and I'm always pretty pleased with my meal. My go-to sandwich shop when I'm in a hurry and don't want to travel too far."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite on the cheap? This is the place for you. Also in need of a donut? Well, this is the place for you too. 

It's a small location, with a rather small dining room. They cram quite a few tables in there, so there are lots of spots to sit while you grub on a sandwich, donut or both. Everything seemed clean although I was less than impressed with the veggie selection. The spinach looked a little wilted and the cucumbers and olives were slightly shriveled and dry. The sandwich was standard and it's a convenient location so I'd probably give them a try again. I still prefer The Spicy Pickle that is located just across the street for a wider variety of menu options and freshness."}
{"text":"Run if the mill subway. Came here while working. The staff are friendly and courteous. And the subs are good quality."}
{"text":"Owners came out to say hi and were very friendly. The place is clean and the food is fresh. Always a good experience. Wish I had more to say but it's Subway - not going to get too excited about it. However if you are looking for a Subway, this is a great one to come to. I love it when the staff and owners take prided in their work and care about their patrons."}
{"text":"Staff is nice, ingredients are fresh. Its easy to make healthier choices. It's clean. A little small but most locations are. Good for picking up a quick and easy meal."}
{"text":"This is our normal go to Subway and we usually have great service, I believe the gentlemen's name is Jason. 

Today we arrived at about 3:15 to a no name sandwich artist...no name tag. When we walked in the place was empty but we were informed that the Internet was down and we had to pay cash. No problem. We walked over to Albertsons bought a few items and got cash back. Subway here we come. 

This time 3 people were in front of us. The first sandwich took forever..like 10 minutes. And it was just meat cheese and black olives. The next person in line made small talk before ordering as did the 3rd person. Both were busy on their phones so either they did not hear or our sandwich artist failed to inform them of the cash only option. The 1st person actually had the nerve to ask if he had cash and she would pay him back at a later date. Might explain the small talk. Neither person in front of me took their sandwiches because neither had cash.

Our sandwich was made fairly quickly and he was pleasant enough. Store wasn't clean, clean but passed inspection. 

Not sure if this will be our Subway anymore. I just can't see standing in line for 30 minutes for 3 slices of meat and a slice of cheese, not when there is another on a few blocks down."}
{"text":"Like the others, don't normally leave a review for fast food, but the service is top notch, they'll greet you, are polite, don't skimp on toppings at all, and I even got a free cookie!  Great managerial staff there.  This place isn't by my work, but if I'm in the mood for a quick lunch, I'll drive to this location."}
{"text":"Quick service, clean place, and the ladies working were very sweet and friendly. The guy in line in front of me was a prick. Just thought I'd share that."}
{"text":"I am
Here couple of times for lunch because it's close to my office, service is too slow, the way they make subs, it's not that great
I ordered veggie salad, they dumped lot of sweet onion sauce in it, not only with my salad it's same with my colleagues.  

If you are too hungry and feel like eating subway better please choose other place that's my suggestion."}
{"text":"This is actually a pretty nice Subway! I like that it is open and you don't feel cramped while waiting."}
{"text":"Vegetarian: 
I got a 6 inch sub with the Veggie Patti, which is made of soy. I also got a variety of vegetables and sauces. It was good and consistent with what I have come to expect from Subway. 

Meat: 
My cousins got kids meals. One with roast beef and the other with turkey with a variety of toppings. The meals came with an Honest Kids juice box, they said the juice was flavorless, and chips. They enjoyed the meals overall.

Overall: 
Service was fast the staff was polite. The restaurant was clean and quiet. Our total was$15 so I was happy with the price."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Subway, but they have some healthier choices for kids than other fast food places.  

This Subway is very efficient and handles their line quickly.  

The tables were kept pretty clean even at lunchtime.  

It is odd that you have to ask for napkins.  I prefer to be able to just get my napkins when getting my beverages.  I am sure they go through less napkins, but if they are that worried about cost control... they should not order imprinted napkins.  

I would return if I was in the area with my daughter and in a rush.  Otherwise, I think 24 Carrots next door is a better choice for me."}
{"text":"I'm not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant, especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other.  I felt it was necessary in this case.  My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park.  The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome.  They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty.  One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding.  The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted.  WOW!  This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too.  He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted.  He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh.  It's refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves.  They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days.  We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly.  He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet.  Amazing.  Only in downtown do you meet people like that.  This is a great Subway.  Go here and skip the others."}
{"text":"I love this Subway. Everyone is always nice and pleasant, I've been here twice and both times the bread was soft and fresh which most of the time when you go to subway it's stale or just not good at all. I'm glad this location is near my job :)"}
{"text":"I had a veggie delight and subway is eew!! I think it might get better and never will I guess cause the bread sucks for one."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Subway because it is always empty.  The lone person working in here will always be happy to have human contact and will help you out immediately.  This makes for a great experience, especially considering they will usually pile on the sandwich contents."}
{"text":"Every subway gives free refills on same visit, but not this place. They're special. And clearly put profits over customer service"}
{"text":"Ugggh I hate this subway.  I hate it the most of any subway I have ever been in, including those I've been to in gas stations.  Especially given that Silvermine is right next door, I would never, ever go here except that I really like the subway tuna salad wraps and the silver mine tuna salad just can't compete.  The vast majority of the employees I have encountered at this particular franchise have been either cross-eyed (no joke) or unwilling to interrupt their cell phone conversations to make me a sandwich.

The best part about this subway is that if it weren't so terrible, I probably never would have tried silver mine, and silver mine is awesome."}
{"text":"Skip it

I love me some Subway and we need a quick sandwich prior to a local sports game but it just was not good. This franchise location needs help. 

The most annoying thing of all was the ice tea. They had none! I asked where the ice tea was and the young lady just shrugged. I think she said the machine was broken and acted like she was annoyed I even asked. I do not drink soda and had already paid for the cup.

The sandwiches my daughter and I bought were just ok, and I felt like both employees there were appeasing us and were practically condescending and not friendly at all. I will skip this location in the future. No wonder there were no people here at dinner time on a week night."}
{"text":"I don't eat sandwiches often  (as you can already tell from most of my check in). Since the Pho place across the street wasn't opened, I figured I would give this subway a try. Service was definitely quick and they recommended me to try their tuna sandwich. For only $5.43, it includes a small soda, half a sandwich and a bag of chips. The dine in area was a bit dirty. I needed to wipe it down before touching the table. 

Overall, my experience here was average and will definitely come back here to try something else again."}
{"text":"Ok...Subway is Subway...but the 5 stars is for all of the employees...they exhibited grace under pressure today!  I have to say how incredibly impressed I was with the service of all of the employees here today! We got here during the lunch time of our convention. Since it was so close to the arena...everyone and their brother was here! No joke...we waited in line for an hour...seriously...almost to the minute..it was a couple minutes longer...but suffice it to say, it was an hour.  When we finally made it to the counter, the poor kids working there were exhausted...but they were all still so friendly! Like I said...nothing spectacular sandwich wise...we all know what they taste like, but I wanted to give a shout out to the kids that work there...because they kept their cool...through seriously hundreds of sandwiches and still found a way to smile and be friendly! Great job crew...appreciate your hard work and professional demeanor!!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews for Subways (sorry).  But this place deserves a review.  

I just witnessed the most kind display of humanity today by the guys working this restaurant. 

They were also extremely friendly and helpful to all customers.  I sure as heck would come back here.

5 Star for super employees.   3 stars for being Subway."}
{"text":"I am echoing comments from 2012 and 2015. Amazing that 4 yrs later and these problems still exist (absolute rudeness from staff). I guess the franchise owner does not really care about customer service (or it's owned by \"the rude ones\" that actually work there). This specific Subway is in the lobby of the building where I work, so it is very convenient to grab breakfast/lunch. BUT, today was definitely the LAST time I ever set foot in there. I ordered a salad and as they were warming up the chicken I was asked about what additions I wanted. First of all their selection was VERY limited (no olives, no mushrooms, no cucumbers) and their iceberg lettuce looked like it was over a week old. When I pointed the lettuce out to her, she said \"oh, it's only the top that looks like that\" - WTH? Why would you put that out then? I proceeded to ask her if they had mushrooms/olives/cucumbers (maybe in the back). She plainly said \"no, and if you want different lettuce and olives, and mushrooms you can go to the other Subway - a few blocks away\" and dismissed me. Too bad we can't give a ZERO star rating because honestly even 1 star (in my opinion) is too much for this establishment!"}
{"text":"Normal subway inside of the Orleans Casino. Standard breakfast sandwiches. Employees seemed a bit confused about the breakfast menu but overall I got what I wanted. No fresh made breakfast omelets like the Subway on the strip."}
{"text":"The lady here was supppper rude. I hate writing bad reviews this is actually my first but I was really upset. She didn't wear a hairnet, but that didn't bother me as much as being rude. I ordered three sandwiches and after explaining what I wanted she said I was confusing her, she had a big attitude. She would give dirty looks and could tell she was losing patience. At this point we were both irritated. My sandwiches were really messy and the place was unsanitary. I didn't get her name but she had red hair. I was really upset with the service."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm actually writing a review for a Subway.  I live a couple of blocks away and go here pretty often.  It's just a Subway, so you know that the food isn't going to be amazing.  At least it's a fast food place where you can eat something that won't kill you.

Anyways, there is this guy named Scott, who is probably about 40 that works at this Subway.  Scott is the most enthusiastic fast food employee I have ever come across in my life.  Not only is he friendly, he knows everything about Subway without coming off as a know it all.  He just apparently REALLY likes working at Subway, and I think that there's something beautiful about that in an odd way.  Most of the other employees are pretty good as well, which is a rarity in fast food.   Many a friend of mine claim that the key to a quality Subway experience is the sandwich artists, and they do it by the book here.  

By the way, Benjamin W. sounds like a total douchebag.  I'm all for making fun of ugly, unpleasant people, but he sounds like he belongs in Old Town Scottsdale, failing to impress women that wouldn't give him the time of day."}
{"text":"I really like this location, I have been here many times all hours of the day and night and have never had any issues. I love subway cause you can get something healthy quick. All the employees I have ran into at this location where friendly and did their job well. Like I went to another location recently and got a chopped salad, I prefer more spinach the lettus basically I like a spinach salad with a little lettus. And she didn't even lesson to me I thought it was so rude of her I should prob write a review about that location. I specifically asked for ALOT of spinach and a little Lettus and she barely put any spinach, then i asked for more spinach and she literally added a few leaves. I was like omg, really?  maybe she didn't like me personally or something maybe she was racist against asain lol idk. But then I thought well if I don't add lettus this is gonna be the tiniest salad ever. Then I asked for lettus and she grabbed a huge handful and dropped it in. I was like god that's so rude to not even lesson to the customer about what hey want and she was skimping on literally everything not just the spinach like I asked for more picked and she added a couple pickles, even tho she put very few to begin w. But not at this place, I think most places give you about a average size salad, and ad more of whatever you ask for. That's what I like about this place. They lesson to you. To bad I just moved and will very rarely be around the area to come back. I go to subways enough to know which ones have good service and which ones to avoid but this is on the good list.  love it. I'm surprised I have never ran into bad service at this location, and I have had many diff people help me."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in great wonderful customer service they look at you when you speak they're not in a rush the very respectful young lady young man was around 2 PM today letting them know thank you keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Super friendly service, I drive out of my way sometimes to eat Subway here. Always get
My order right and very courteous service. Even with a long line they work hard to move everyone along quickly!"}
{"text":"This subway needs to change their schedule if you close every night at 9:30 pm or 9:40 pm then this should be listed instead of 10 pm. 3 times I've went to this subway at they were closed at 9:30 and 9:40."}
{"text":"2 of my friends asked me to buy them subway sandwiches (spicy italian& black forest ham) on my way to work. There was a teen behind the counter about 14-15 years old , he made the sandwiches. While making the spicy italian, he took some pepperoni and while placing it on the bread he dropped it. He picked it up thinking i did not saw him and placed it on the sandwich. I told him didn't you just drop that?! And He said oh no, i threw it away not unless you wanted it ( as if joking) i was so disgusted i threw it in a trash can outside. I will never come here!!!!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Subway...a lot, and unfortunately, this place has always been a disappointment. It's cramped, dimly lit, and is often dirty. 

While some employees are moderately friendly, I would describe most of them as slow, inattentive, and disinterested. Some are so slow that I venture I could make the sandwiches faster. 

Hopefully the franchise owner will look to make some improvements in the quality of the service and appearance of the place. Until then, I'll pass. It's not the worst Subway in the Valley, but it's in the bottom third."}
{"text":"Melissa is great. She was understanding. However. The rest of the staff was quick to use curse words and unfriendly language, and also talked about previous customers in a negative fashion. I told Mellisa all of this., I will NOT visit this store again."}
{"text":"Disgusting. No toilet paper.  No seat covers. When I mentioned it to the cashier the response was we don't have any."}
{"text":"Okay, so to be fair all subways are just subways.  I love subway for fast food options and i will always go there....
But never again to this location.
I work near here and i go here for lunch regularly but this very particular day the large man with glasses behind the counter basically tried ot lecture me on why Veganism is ridiculous and telling me that meat is delicious.  
Ridiculing me for my beliefs and basically making fun of me for it.  I was literally just WAITING for him to tell me the price for my 6 inch sub while he's telling me \"Animals stink but they're delicious to eat\"...
Like, don't ask why i'm a vegan and then berate me for my lifestyle choice...
I will never return and i suggest no other vegetarians or vegans go here unless you feel like debating and arguing and being belittled by an overweight man who thinks he's above you.
He  also told me other coworker that she had ugly hair and needed to fix it on a separate occasion...
Same fat guy.
Same horrible opinionated outlook on life, ready to tell others how they're wrong.
The Worst."}
{"text":"I came just because I received a coupon through text for a sub then came to find out this location doesn't Accor digital coupons. Well if they'd answer the phone I wouldn't have wasted time and gas coming this location . The location sucks because of the entrances to the location don't go here. Not to mention the didnt have lettuce jalapeños and something else that ridiculous!!! That's like bk not having buns"}
{"text":"Standard Subway fare.  If you enjoy your Subway, you'll enjoy this place.  I thought it funny when I was in there last that I saw a pizza person delivering pizza to the staff and I thought, should I be getting a pizza instead.  Friends of mine say this is common.  Even Subway folks don't want to have sandwiches every day.  Also it was quite comical that one of the guys at the counter shared his attraction for a girl that just left with one of his co-workers vocally.  So they are pretty laid back and friendly."}
{"text":"I don't give them 5 starts because it's not amazing but i think it's pretty good for a subway. If you are looking for a clean, ok service and fast food...why not? 
I had order online to picked up and they messed part of my order but nothing major. It supposed to be hot and they gave me a cold sandwich."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The kids there looked like their job was the most painful thing they had to do. I'll do port of subs before I deal with punk teenagers again."}
{"text":"Came for a quick breakfast on my way to work early morning. Was the only customer.  Sandwich turned out fine since Subway's consistency is something you can always count on.  But I also ordered a large coffee. Watched her pour it and noticed the liquid was obviously clear, making me suspect there's less coffee and more water.  Took a sip right away before paying and let her know it wasn't brewed right.  She immediately replied, so you don't want coffee then?\" I said, \"No, I do want coffee. But this must've been brewed without a fresh bag.\" She replied, \"That's the way it is. So you don't want coffee.\" Clearly not interested in dealing with the 1 customer in the building and even less interested in properly brewing a real pot of Seattle's Best, she took my cup back and charged only for my sandwich.  I always prefer Subway for breakfast over the greasier fast food spots, but I won't prefer it at this location again."}
{"text":"Ordered through doordash twice this week from this restaurant. The first time I received my food a small portion of my lettuce was brown so I was a little irritated but whatever(01/30). I ordered food again because the WM open is going on and my lunch is only 30 minutes(02/01). This time over half the lettuce was brown and slimy! I ended up throwing the sandwich away. How do you put lettuce like that on someone sub and think it's okay?! I don't even feed my turtles lettuce in that condition. Frickin disgusting!"}
