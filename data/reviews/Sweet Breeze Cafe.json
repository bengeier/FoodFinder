{"text":"Great place, friendly owners, definitely a place to get some work done while supporting a family owned coffee shop. One of my go-to places."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to coffee place.  The coffee here is really good! I usually go for the latte or iced cappuccino, and I have been meaning to try the affogato (ice cream with hot espresso - my 2 favourite things)!  The desserts here are awesome and actually taste homemade. They're not too sweet, and it seems like there's a different selection everyday.  The venue is really nice too and a cute place for a coffee date. I'm always up for trying something new and it's pretty hard to find nice local cafes like this one in Brampton, so my friends and I love it here!"}
{"text":"I had the egg and avacado sandwich which was very fresh and tasty. Really simply made on focaccia bread with mayo, avacado and egg ($5).   The drinks are very over priced. A hot chocolate and chai latte were almost $4 which is borderline Starbucks prices. They tasted very average so not really worth the money.  As for the crepes, we ordered Nutella and an apple cinnamon crepe. Both were good but not exceptional. A little thick/dough-y for the $12 price tag.   Would I go back here? Probably not   Would I go back here if I was in the nearby area? Only for the egg and avacado sandwich :)   NOTE: They only accept cash or debit."}
{"text":"I feel like this café has great potential. It's very clean and nicely decorated and designed. The people are friendly as well. I ordered the chai tea latte which was delicious. I ordered also a chicken panini which I wasn't too happy with. I don't understand why they didn't put real cheese. So, I feel like if they up their food game a bit this would be great."}
{"text":"Very nice. Beautiful decor. Comfortable. Lots of seating. Washroom was nice too. Spacious, clean, modern decor, automated fixtures. I felt very comfortable as a solo visitor here for a coffee break and to catch up on email. Free wifi is available.   Service was very good.   My latte was delicious. Smooth, and robust. No bitterness or sour aftertaste. At first I thought it was somewhat pricey ($4 for a latte) but the serving is generous.   It's located in a plaza, not particularly picturesque but there is an interesting large modern church to look at while sitting at the outdoor table."}
{"text":"I was absolutely sold from the second I walked in.  It is such a nice, cozy environment created from great color selections, lighting, and artwork. Sweet Breeze offers a number of desserts, some lunch options like paninis and wraps, and an assortment of teas and coffees. I was unable to order a crepe as it is strictly on Sundays,  but I was recommended to try their chocolate cheesecake with my espresso from an extremely friendly owner that made me feel very comfortable despite being in a business that is deeply involved in the Polish community judging from posters on their windows and the patrons I overheard as I worked on my laptop. The cake was phenomenal as it was so fresh and wasn't too sweet. I am definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This is the place for coffee and pastries.Great environment and friendly staff. I will be coming back"}
{"text":"A local polish cafe surrounded by a Polish church and supermarket. The staff is friendly and the interior has a nice European flair. You pay at the counter and they bring everything to your table.  The negatives are that you need to come at strategic times not near when mass lets out or before they close or you wont find a seat. We came at 10 AM on a Thursday morning and we were the only customers.  We had a couple of Cappuccinos and pieces of cake which were awesome! One thing to note is that the debt machine does not prompt for a tip so i would bring some cash for a tip as they are really nice.  This is a true hidden gem in Brampton."}
{"text":"This cozy cafe has nice pictures on the wall. Its a very clean place. The menu is not easily accessible to customers, its behind the cashiers counter on the wall. We wanted to order breakfast sandwiches or bagels but there was not much variety when it came to a breakfast menu. So we ordered one egg and avocado sandwich which was on a toasted foccacia bread. It was simple but delicious.  We also ordered a nutella crepe and a apple cinnamon crepe. Both were good but nothing extra ordinary. They have more variety of pastry(s)/cakes, but no labels to see what to order. I think it would be helpful to put labels on the desserts. If there were labels it would have been much easier. We got Havana cake which was very fresh and tasty.  They also have a small patio (for 2 people) outside the cafe. If you want to try out a new spot for coffee or desserts then come by and check it out!  Note: They only accept cash or debit."}
{"text":"Cute, Polish café right beside a Polish church!  Church has a red steeple and is very iconic landmark.  Parking:  A bit awkward, especially near café.  Lot is shared with the church, so apparently it can get busy.  Interior:  Small, but very nice with large, artistic photos posted.  Nice lighting.  This café serves primarily caffeinated drinks (espresso, coffees, &/or teas) and desserts, including waffles, crepes, cakes, & a couple of sandwiches.  I believe they served borscht too.    I asked the girl who was working and owner makes the cakes.  We got 2 slices to go and it was $7 and change.  Apple Cheesecake was nice, fluffy and fruit roll was cream-filled.  Both were light and not too sweet, tasted homemade.  I preferred this cheesecake over Japanese cheesecake.  Definitely a good place to stop, when you're in the area, for a dessert and warm drink!"}
