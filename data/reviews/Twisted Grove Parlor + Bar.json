{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch on a recent Sunday. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very cool and welcoming. We sat outside on the very large spacious patio because the weather was so nice. We realized that we could easily bring our dog here, since there was plenty of space. We were immediately comfortable. Our waitress was very friendly, laid back, and very helpful.  My husband had the crispy grouper sandwich and it was incredible! (he let me have a bite)  His fries were very good too.  I had the crab cake salad which was also extremely tasty.  We also had some delicious home made shandys.  We will definitely be back to this place soon!!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambience, location, service, food, drinks. Many choices on menu. Had the salmon and it was excellent! Bruschetta Board was great as well. Takes reservations - even at last minute! Restaurant full so do recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"2nd time back, enjoying the Twisted Grove Parlor & Bar. Service Mgr. Joe doesn't disappoint; warm greeting and personal service each time! And our Server extraordinaire Lauren...well well, big smile, congenial, super informative and excellent personal service. Thank you Chef  Christopher Collins! And next time, we'll talk all about the FOOD and DRINKS!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Staff was nice and accommodating for a large group. The mushroom pasta is a must have!"}
{"text":"This is a charming and fresh feeling place with their act together. This is the best restaurant we have discovered in ages, and that says something in a resort town! The crab cakes, sunny salad and fish sandwich were special, as were the cookies and milk for dessert;) We were in on Mother's Day and all had truly delicious meals. Even the kids were wide-eyed with thumbs up! Our server, Emily, was amazing, attentive, and made our time a delight! We will be back again and again to a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant twice.  First experience was a good one though it seemed like they were working out the kinks, servers and bar staff were bickering over how food should be delivered.  Overall the food was good, I had the Wild Mushroom Pappardelle and my wife had the Twisted Noodle Salad.

For our most recent visit, we brought my wife's sister.  I ordered the mushroom dish again, and they split the Twisted Noodle Salad and the Crab Cakes.  This time, my dish wasn't as great as the first visit, it was okay, but not something get again.  Too few mushrooms and the sauce left a weird after taste.

My wife and her sister had an entirely different experience they enjoyed their meal and agreed they would return, but they both got extremely ill the next morning.  When they tried to alert the restaurant the manager just told them, that no one else complained and didn't seem to care about their their experience.

Needless to say we cancelled our Valentines day reservations and will not be giving this place another chance.  It a shame because we also thought about to reserving their \"Boardroom\" for an upcoming event.

A little humility (and proper food handing) goes a long way.

By the way, I don't usually leave reviews and don't usually value one star reviews, but they deserved this one."}
{"text":"Great menu / food! Ordered the tri tip sandwich and loved it. It comes with amazing french fries but next time Im going to see if I can do a side salad instead. The restaurant is a lot bigger than anticipated and the patio is super cute! Highly recommend this place. Wish I would have found it sooner."}
{"text":"OH MY! Such rave reviews about the food. If only I could be waited on in a timely manner, maybe I could appreciate it! The food is overpriced and the service is extremely poor. I have had 4 bad experiences at that restaurant. I couldn't even enjoy my food after waiting to be waited on and waiting for the food to come. Twisted waiting. Oh, let me find your server, oh, let me find your server....twisted is right."}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner there on the large back patio! The service and food were absolutely amazing! All of our guests complimented to me on how great the food was! The staff was so helpful with setting up and meeting our guests needs! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch.  Both the grouper and Carlsbad chicken are excellent.  For sides you cannot go wrong with the cauliflower grits.  The food here is delicious and they feature the type of menu that makes you want to keep coming back to try new things."}
{"text":"Oh my what a gem!!!  I have been to this place 5 times then have had a top notch meal and experience each time.  Seriously you can't go wrong with any menu selections.  Service has been superb at lunch and dinner.  I will have to give my nod to the crab cakes as being my favorite.  Outside of Maryland these are the best I have had.  My recommendation would be to get the salad with the crab, because the entrée is two cakes so you better think about sharing it is so much food.  The bruschetta board is a must.  You definitely want to same some space for desert that can be as novel as it comes...........chocolate milk and cookies; seriously.  The wine list is adequate with some very nice selections.  I think any but the most ardent wine snob would find something very acceptable to enjoy.  This is probably my favorite Common Ground property."}
{"text":"The grouper was good.  Too much breading for me.  The French dip was good.  The meat was very good.  Could have had a crusty bread.  The Brussels sprouts were nice.  The roasted cauliflower had a sauce on it which wasn't expected.  Very nice presentation.  A lot of other things on the menu that looked interesting."}
{"text":"Bruschetta plate with a choice of three of five topping choices was outstanding. Even the bread in which they came was impressive. Our favorite was choice number one which included prosciutto,  marscarpone cheese, and sweet pepper relish. Oysters on the half shell were fresh and large. We shared rotisserie chicken, potatoes with cheese and bacon. We ordered a side of spaghetti squash with cheese and cracked black pepper. Delicious. The service was prompt and informed. One negative of our dinner dish was an overpowering so the sausage stuffing."}
{"text":"Ate here today with some friends for the first time.  We were all very pleased from the moment we walked in.  We sat at the bar and was greeted by Joseph our Bartendar.  He was very friendly and informative / helpful on all the menu items.  We started off with the oysters in a half shell.  Very tasty and the cocktail/horseradish sauce that came with it was perfect in flavor.  I got the Carlsbad chicken sandwich.  It was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Also, got the cauliflower grits which were to die for....loved it!!!  My one friend got the grilled eggplant sandwich with creamed spinach.  She said the sandwich was ok.  Couldn't really taste the eggplant and the cheese was a little overwhelming. The creamed spinach was good.  My other friend got the gnocchi & short ribs.  He absolutely loved it. I tried it and it was amazing.  The gnocchi was cooked perfect and the short ribs just melted in your mouth.  

Our overall experience was very enjoyable and pleasant.  We look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Happy hour was excellent. Paloma margarita and prime rib slider were my favorites from the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Love this place! Our second visit. Better than the first. Food to die for...roasted brussel sprouts, roasted cauliflower, oysters, vesper martinis...etc. Great service from our server, Lauren. Joe, the service manager, provides such wonderful person service! Thank you Christopher Collins for providing a wonderful restaurant in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Poor service - they called it \"group service\" when we asked - one person poured water, one took order, one delivered, etc. - the end result was that there was no personal feel and nobody was responsible.  Nobody in front when we left so nobody to talk to, didn't seem to be anyone \"in charge\".  And unfortunately food was also not good.  Somewhat fancy, but there were four of us and none of us thought the food was great. A disappointment overall."}
{"text":"This was not good food.  The night started out with their fresh squeezed lemonade.  I'm not sure if the lemons were bad or if they just didn't add sugar, but it nearly burned my throat drinking it.  I had to send it back, and I never send anything back, because it was completely un-drinkable.  We ordered the spinach dip and both felt that it was extremely heavy on the salt and the chips came covered in raw onion, red pepper, and sour cream.  A matter of preference here but the dip should have been able to stand by itself without the weird nacho thing they tried to do on the side.  The gnocchi was my main course and it didn't get any better.  It was a strange mix of bitter confetti Italian squash, mushroom cream, and badly cooked gnocchi.  Gnocchi is one of my favorite dishes and this was more or less inedible. 

I will say that the service was extremely friendly and nice.  It's too bad the food couldn't live up to this place's hype."}
{"text":"Great food and service from Tatiana was superb. The owner stopped by to check on our meal. It's a definite for us."}
{"text":"First time here, for lunch.  Overpriced, for portion sizes. Had the Twisted noodle salad($16), it was amazing!  I really enjoyed how fresh it was!  Service was good, the atmosphere was very welcoming! $3 for a 10oz green tea.  Yes, the food is good, but it is way too expensive for what you get, especially the salads!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an amazing lunch with my daughter . The Brussels sprouts and bacon appetizers were simply a delight. Salads were delicious... best crab cake ever. And our gracious hostess surprised us with a beautiful and complimentary portion of très leches cake that was sinfully delicious. Will certainly go back :)"}
{"text":"Great service from Quintin! Happy to have more nice options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Very good food and service. The gnocchi and short ribs are amazing! The crab cakes are to die for! The vibe of the restaurant is very nice, and they have a great bar. They have some yummy cocktails too. The butterscotch-pecan pie is so good. They serve brunch on Saturday and Sunday with a Bloody Mary and Bellini bar. I highly recommend Twisted Gove!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this amazing restaurant, its owner and staff.  We've been in several times and are never disappointed.  In fact, we like it so much we decided to have our rehearsal dinner here so we could share it with our friends and family.  The food, drinks and service were outstanding.  Thank you so much Twisted Grove, for going all out for our special occasion."}
{"text":"Viva la brussel sprouts! Do yourself a favor and get them. Perfectly charred and fantastic. Even the presentation was the best I've seen yet for brussel sprouts! Our waitress said they are the number 2 selling item on the menu, the number one being the grouper sandwich.

Everyone in our group this evening loved their meal! We all had those \"oh my gosh this is good!\" moments. Even our friend from Italy gave two thumbs up on her Wild Mushroom Pappardelle, which is a big deal coming from her. She said order it as is, do not add meat, as the flavors were perfect and balanced!  She then lamented that Italians don't put chicken, shrimp, etc on their pasta the way Americans do!

My husband really enjoyed his grouper sandwich. Our friend loved his Gnocchi & Short ribs, but he wished the dish had a larger portion. To be fair, he was warned by our waitress ahead of time about the portion size. My salmon and spaghetti squash was excellent. My piece of fish was really fresh, large, and well prepared. Our side of cauliflower grits were delicious as well and worth getting. 

Twisted Root, Twisted Grove, I don't care what they end up calling it... we will all be back! We also all decided that we preferred this over Grassroots. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. For me, I have to crave and day dream about going to a particular restaurant to make it 5 stars.

Side note: The owner was the only person smart enough to convince the landlord to construct a wall in the restaurant reducing the enormous square footage by 50%. I believe that's part of the reason why all other restaurants failed in this space, way too massive of a footprint which caused them to always look empty!"}
{"text":"Twisted Grove is hands down one of my favorite places to go! The food is outstanding. They have a great happy hour and the service is impeccable. Such a great variety of food whether you're looking for a salad, pasta or flatbread. There aren't too many places in Scottsdale that you get great food, great ambiance and service! I highly recommend Twisted grove for dinner or hosting an event!"}
{"text":"First time visit - great spot , lively and busy for a Wednesday . TVs in bar area -  menu is nice a great selection from salads, flatbread to salmon .
We all enjoyed our meals and would return for 2nd visit ."}
{"text":"Wasn't greeted by anyone until we stumbled onto the bar. Bartender never asked how his horrible cocktails were.  Ordered 3 happy hour items, took a bite of each and left.  Don't waste your time, just go to Grass Roots."}
{"text":"Came to Arizona for our grandson's graduation. While here we had a chance to catch up with other family members: We invited them to dinner but asked that they choose where we went so we ended up at Twisted Grove. It couldn't have been a more perfect place. Our server was very accommodating (especially since we went towards the end of the evening). Our food was delicious. As we left the restaurant we were busy talking and I forgot my take home box and our server graciously brought it out to us.  The next time we're in Arizona we will definitely be going back to Twisted Grove."}
{"text":"The gnocchi and spare ribs are wonderful. I Will probably crave it from a 3 hr away drive and I will be back to to cure that crave."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM!  Some friends and I met here for Happy Hour before a concert and it was amazing.  None of us could decide what to order so we got a bunch of appetizers off the HH menu and a large salad.  Delish!  It was also extremely reasonable. 
It's been sad watching restaurant after restaurant fail in this space so really hope this one takes.  The ambiance and food are perfect so hope it's a home run for them. I know I'll be going back as much as possible."}
{"text":"I attended the twisted grove, and while dining at this fine eatery I had plethora of Brussels sprouts that were amazing. The staff was amazing and was always attentive when needed. One of the bus boys Peter made the dining experience much more pleasurable because he was attentive to my every need and was actually a pretty funny guy. If you were debating on we're to go tonight I would recommend the twister grove, this place and this management could potentially be the next Fox concept restaurant. Especially with staff like Peter."}
{"text":"We were here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The food was tasty and we enjoyed it. However, the service was pretty slow for the small amount of patrons in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Our waitress Lindsay was an absolute doll! My small group shared the artichoke dip and Brussels sprouts, it was amazing and the perfect size! Quick stop for some good food and drinks before heading back to California. I'll be back when I come to visit!"}
{"text":"Caitlyn and Chris- I have to say are the warmest bartenders in town!  It's a way classier cheers atmosphere- where these two always greet you with your first name. Rare in Arizona. 

Many steps up from the last few restaurants that have been in here. Food is great-service is with a smile. 

Brunch on Sunday's- ultimate."}
{"text":"I saw a few reviews recently mentioning poor service, but that has never been our experience. Every server/bartender we've ever had here has been extremely friendly and attentive and the food is always outstanding. I would venture to say some of the best food in the city and not nearly as expensive as the other restaurants that match the quality.

They also have an awesome happy hour (food and cocktails). Try a shandy! I had never had one before coming here and now I'm hooked!

Probably our favorite spot in the neighborhood. Grassroots (owned by the same family) is great too, but this place has something special."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is soooo cute! The food is delicious and the vibe of the place was great. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Twisted Grove 4 times in the last month. First stopped in looking for a place to have a near future Birthday Happy Hour (3-6) at. Was hoping it would be good and I was not disappointed! My bartender Joseph was super welcoming and knowledgeable with the drink menu. I had given wine up for Lent and was looking for a beer comparable to Kiltlifter. He knew exactly which beer to suggest for me (Abita amber) and it was yummy and ice cold. I had the Tri-tip sliders off the Happy Hour menu. The meat was shaved thin and melted in your mouth. Awesome on the toasted pretzel roll. After a few beers, I also sampled the zucchini chips. Thin, crispy and like a certain potato chip, you can't eat just one. I decided right then that my Birthday party would be here. I texted everyone as I sipped my last beer.
On my 2nd recon visit (gotta try some other items to recommend to my friends-don't I?) Reggie took good care of me. I had the Bruschetta and so should you. It is hands down the best I have ever eaten. You get to pick 3 from the selection of 5. I had the ricotta with cherry jam, the one with burrata, candied bacon and crispy onion strings and for the third it was goat cheese, dates, candied walnuts and a little honey. The bread they use is absolutely perfect for bruschetta. Nice crust on the outside and soft on the inside. All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. Could not leave without trying the charred Brussels sprouts. OMG! Charring them brings out such depth.  Pairing it with a few bits of candied bacon is brilliant and then you get a little tang from the balsamic reduction. It just makes your mouth say \"Wow, more please!\".
Now it's Birthday Happy Hour time! Got there right at 3 with my designated driver. By 4, we had about 10 people. Our waiter Tony was absolutely amazing! Separate checks was not a problem at all for him. Never once saw him write anything down. Had it all perfect. Since some people had arrived sooner than others we were all of different time schedules as far as who was ordering food and who needed another drink. Tony never missed a beat and we never went thirsty or hungry!
Thanks, Tony! Everybody loved everything. Lent being over I was able to sample the wine menu. Love the Roth Cabernet. Tried a different bruschetta this time. Sounded a little strange since I had never seen anything like it. Avocado, pickled onion, cilantro and jalapeno? Not a fan of raw onions but I love me some Mexican flavors so why not try it? Another OMG! The creaminess of the avocado with the cilantro and the bite of the jalapeno on the toasted bread was outstanding. I even very much liked the thin pickled onion. Who knew? We tried some other items off the regular menu (salads, pepper glazed goat cheese, parmesan-garlic frittes, hot coco, tres leches cake) and they were all great. 
The last time I was there it was more beer and bruschetta. This time 2 avocado ones and 1 burrata and candied bacon. More excellent service. Thanks, Kimmy for your special help.
Actually starting to get a little hungry now. Been thinking about trying the sausage and onion flatbread for a while now. Cocktail hour is not too far away...... and from where I live neither is The Twisted Grove!
Think I'm going to finish my chores and head on over."}
{"text":"Have been here three times and am impressed with the service and food quality. The grouper sandwich is really good and the cheese fries are tasty.my wife had the crab cakes and was well pleased.
You won't be disappointed with this resturant.
DonF"}
{"text":"Finally a great new spot in the neighborhood.  We really, really like Grass Roots (sister restaurant), but love Twisted Root more.  Same great, friendly service, but the menu has so many things on it that I like...making it possible to eat there regularly. I had gnocchi with short ribs and it was fantastic.  My kids loved it too, although they may not have a kid's menu.  We didn't ask as the pizza/flatbread was delicious and reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and this place hands down has excellent service, delicious food, and a nice modern atmosphere. We had mimosas with our lunch today and did I mention it was with freshly squeezed orange juice??? Doesn't get better than this and will come back again soon."}
{"text":"I'm breaking my rule of not writing a review until after two visits because we had a great meal at Twisted Grove with excellent service from a personable waitress. Alissa was awesome.

We had two appetizers, the bruschetta was varied in flavor, taste and texture ... very nice. I had a double order of oysters, cold and fresh like the ocean itself.

For entrees I had the Sea Bass and my GF ordered the crab cakes. I loved my bass and the spaghetti squash ... but her crab cakes were phenomenal, so moist and the crab was the star of the show with less emphasis on cake. I'm from Rhode Island, very picky on seafood ... Twisted Grove does a great job with fish.

About that teary eyed pregnant lady giving this place two stars. Twisted should get a hormone disclaimer on that one ... Sheesh."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience at Twisted Grove.
The management needs training on how not to embarrass and deal with guests that have not liked a meal or salad. The manager was rude and I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Seemed like the Air conditioning wasn't working and 
Will not go back and don't think food is good as well."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Thursday and because of the experience alone, I will be returning soon.  Matt was my bartender and he makes a mean Mule. He also recommended the \"off the menu\" burger. O. M. G. This was the best burger I have EVER had. If you ever want to go here, please ask for Matt. Let him be your guide on a wonderful journey."}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times only for happy hour until tonight. Great wine list and happy hour. Tonight I had their crab cakes which were excellent! The noodle salad was amazing. I love all.the flavors they put in their food. My favorite place right now."}
{"text":"They need to change the menu and then they will get a higher rating. First time we went there we liked the drinks and food choices but they haven't updated the choices for a year or more."}
{"text":"Twisted Grove is great we go all the time. Joseph and Tony are two great Bartenders and add to enjoyment of restaurant. We love it a great addition to Scottsdale ."}
{"text":"The food was good, but far too expensive based on service. After the young lady took my order, the food arrived quickly, however she never came back to the table to ask how things were, refill water, etc. I will not be returning here any time soon."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful late lunch at this new McCormick Ranch hot spot!!!  Twisted Root!!! Great patios and comfortable indoor seating we were excited to try something new. 
From the Bruscetta board to the AMAZING Grouper sandwich, to the homemade Chocolate milk and cookies the meal was delicious and memorable! Try the spaghetti squash as an inventive side.  Definitely will be our new go to spot!!! The service was very awesome as well, and our waiter Matt made our first experience a great one!!!"}
{"text":"Great menu, great food, dog friendly on the patio. Always our first choice!"}
{"text":"The bloody Mary I had was spectacular!! We also loved the roasted brussel sprouts appetizer!!

The sandwiches were good, but I thought they would have more umph based on the drinks and appetizer."}
{"text":"I am an all or nothing reviewer, meaning it has to be really good or really bad for me to review and Twisted Grove is great.  If you are not price sensitive then the food will blow your mind.  I am addicted to the grilled artichokes.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food; inattentive service. 

Not sure why...it was a quiet Tuesday evening in July!! The wine seemed to take forever....again, not sure why because the restaurant and bar was less than 25% full. I shudder to think what the service is like during peak season.

Back to the food. The spinach salad was wonderful -- the pickled onions were perfect and the mustard dressing was a nice change. The cavatelli carbonara was perfect. Rich, but not filling. I am not surprised it is the owner's favorite.

Back to the service. The server at Sweet Provisions (owned by the same company, across the parking lot) put the staff at Twisted Grove to shame. She was great...and took care of each customer with great patience and care."}
{"text":"Last night was my 4th time at Twisted Grove, A couple of times, I would have to rate as a 5 star experience, and the other two times, not so high, averaging out to a 3 star restaurant.

The good; Almost every menu choice has been really good, if not excellent. Caprese flat bread and garlic fries were awesome. 

The bad: Totally can be fixed, but the blackened swordfish was overcooked, making it dry, and was seriously light on the blackening seasoning.

The ugly: Last night I ordered the crispy fish sandwich, for the 2nd time, and thought it was really pretty good. Both times I requested to have the cole slaw on the side, and both times it was served on the side. Last night I requested to also have my sandwich cut in half, same as last time. Here comes the ugly. The food was served, and my sandwich was a whole and not two halves. My server informed me that they no longer cut sandwiches in half. I was taken aback. I asked to talk to the manager. He came over, and made it clear, that without exception, 

\"NO WE WON\"T CUT YOUR SANDWICH  IN HALF\"

C'mon now. Really? And the reason given was that it is a time issue. Saturday night at 7:30, with 50% of the restaurant empty seems like the manager would do anything to foster repeat business.  

The bottom line - The restaurant graveyard is not too far away. It has already claimed Zen 32, Stella, and the Central Bistro. All in the same exact spot as Twisted Grove. 

I will still go back, but only at someone else's request. For me, I'll pick a place with valet, or readily available parking, and a kitchen that will make the time to spend 4 seconds on cutting my sandwich in half!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at both locations of Twisted Grove. We tried out happy hour food & drinks, along with a flatbread pizza. They have a decent beer selection (unique choices not just the same ol' stuff) and I've tried a few of the cocktails. Some were better than others but that's life and I'm picky when it comes to drinks. The service was great at both locations!

The bruschetta was impressive! You get large pieces of toast with plenty of toppings and it's a great deal for happy hour. The fish tacos were amazing, extremely flavorful and perfectly done. Their pickled onions on the tacos and bruschetta were fantastic. We also ordered the angry bird pizza after trying their house-made hot sauce on the table. The pizza was pretty good, very crunchy flatbread and a good toppings ratio but I dislike dark meat chicken so overall it wasn't my favorite. I can't wait to try more food from here, looking through the menu I see a lot of things I really want to try, so I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my second visit to this restaurant was awful! While the food was very good, with the exception of the stale chips served with the hummus plate, our service could not have been worse. Our greeting at the front was just meh, and when our server came by to take our drink order and we asked for her recommendation for which was their best buttery chardonnay (as their wine menu is extensive) her response was \"I don't know\" followed by nothing. Not a, let me ask the bartender or would you like to try a taste of something. We had to ask her to talk to the bartender. When she came back to our table, she put a glass of wine down on the side of the table and walked away - no comment about what it was!!! Why was she so put off by such a simple question??? Thankfully a very nice server came by and took over our table. While we thought our visit had been salvaged by this new server, it was soured once we finished our dinner and were constantly hounded by different server after server if they could \"get us anything else\"....literally 4 different servers came by in a matter of 10 minutes trying to usher us out of there, and we still had our wine to finish. 

I may give this place one more shot as any restaurant can have a bad night, but will cautiously recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Had a very disappointing experience last night with friends from out of town. The \"service\" was as bad as any of us had experienced anywhere. Drinks took 20 minutes per round and several reminders. The wrong food was brought to our table multiple times and the staff acted like it was their first day on the job. We brought these issues to the attention of several employees  throughout the course of the evening and nothing improved. We've enjoyed the restaurant in the past and thought it would be a nice spot to host our guests. Never again. No idea how you'll stay in business in the hyper-competitive Phoenix restaurant scene."}
{"text":"i have eaten here 3 times now and everything from drinks to appetizers to entrees to desserts is amazing! happy hour is great with a particularly good deal on fresh delicious oysters and drinks. Carbonara dish is probably my favorite so far."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. I hosted a baby shower today in the Boardroom and the Chef and staff couldn't have been more accommodating. The food was plentiful, the service was friendly, the decor was perfect and our mom to be couldn't have been happier. From booking the event, to choosing the food and drinks to working within our budget everything was top notch. Even with 20+ people we couldn't finish all the food and by the time I went to take my To Go Box, all the guests had filled their boxes with the yummy yummy food. I can't wait to go back for dinner or enjoy Sunday brunch. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came for a large party and had to book their \"Boardroom\" which has a dining minimum. Ok no biggie. What got me was after I paid I realized two things. the side that was served with my entree was too Smokey (from the bacon they said) and I got charged for the side dish that they swapped it out for. As well, we ordered i believe two of each of the desserts listed on their menu, which I think four were listed. one of the desserts that was on the menu was not available so It was swapped with one of the other desserts. And I guess there was a special for the desserts (which we were not told about) so they served us two of the specials in addition to the desserts we ordered. Thus in all we got several dessert items we did not order. We were not asked if that would be ok, we were just served Them and charged for them.

I'm surprised or maybe even a bit dismayed they took such liberties and advantage of us. Maybe Bc they knew our tab was going to be large and a few extra charges might go unnoticed. 

their appetizers are far better than their entrees."}
{"text":"What a wonderful spot! We started off with the spinach, artichoke dip, WOW! Hands down the best dip I have had in a long time. For my entree, I had the gnocchi and short rib...delicious. Great atmosphere and our server was great."}
{"text":"Girl time in Scottsdale! We started with two appetizers: Summer Hummus and Charred Brussel Sprouts and Bacon. Both were delicious! For the main course we each chose something different. Melt in your mouth Gnocchi and Short Ribs, Chicken Caesar salad, Noodle Salad with Steak and Angry Bird flatbread.  Everything was delicious! Great food and loved the atmosphere! Teresa said the Gnocchi is comparable to New York Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"15+ min sitting at a tale waiting for our water. We just decided to leave. A ton of servers passed our table and one was talking to a table close to ours. Maybe that was our server. Who knows? Left that little white card on our table as well."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and really liked the ambience.  Service was excellent.  I enjoyed the sweet and spicy margarita.  I also had the goat cheese and chicken flatbread which was delicious.  Portion was substantial so my husband helped with finishing.  My husband had the crab cake and salad which he said was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"First of all I would like to say that your server absolutely can make or break your meal. Amber made our meal. She was amazing! She was very descriptive, knew her menu and was suggestive and was intuitive with what we would like to order. We ordered drinks starting with the white Cosmo which was not too sweet, very light and then ordered the brussels sprouts with caramelized bacon absolutely delicious. Try the flatbread with buison cheese....melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Wow! Twisted Grove has been my husband and I's favorite restaurant since they opened! In December, we called them up (as we planned our wedding in 4 days) and they just happened to have a holiday party cancellation that allowed for us to reserve the entire outside area for  40 people for our reception dinner. Karen and her team went ABOVE and BEYOND our expectations. We met with her and planned out all details just two days prior. They we're extremely accommodating, from setting up all of our decorations the day of to packing them up that night for us. The food was outstanding as always, and my husband, being the soup lover that he is, was really looking forward to having it on our menu. Prior to this, Twisted Grove did not have soup on their menu. They took this special request and made an absolutely delicious shrimp bisque!! You've got to try their food anytime you have the chance and when it comes to a lunch or dinner event, this is the place to host it!!"}
{"text":"Love supporting local so I went to this place with my best friend today for lunch. Service was great and so was the food. Great atmosphere. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience. Diverse menu really impressed, lots of great options, the charred Brussels Sprouts were awesome. Excellent atmosphere with a kind and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Good customer service, fast, and wonderful delicious food !
We ordered the charred Brussels sprouts appetizer and for entree : twisted noodle salad, gnocchi and short ribs and cavatelli carbonara... that was one of the best meals each one in our table had! 
For dessert tres leches cake! Yummy"}
{"text":"We were so thrilled to see that our favorite Scottsdale restaurant was opening another in our neighborhood.  Everything about this place is great!  The service, food, and ambiance are top notch and such a wonderful addition to the area.  First visit, we ordered the Brussels sprouts and two flatbreads (the angry Bird and the sausage and onion) and returned again the following week with friends and shared the Burrata Salad my husband glad the French dip, and I had the Noodle salad with steak. We would definitely get any of those choices again but also can't wait to try other things on the menu. Love this place!!

Returned for our 3rd time in 3 weeks and we were so disappointed that the Burrata and Heirloom salad were off the menu :( I understand that things change with the season but PLEASE bring it back!!"}
{"text":"Great food; interesting, unique menu.  Fab drink menu.  Love the outdoor seating.  Really fun vibe.  Great staff, friendly, cool place.  Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Waitresses were really sweet. Three things make us give it only 3 stars: the food was only room temp when it got to the table, they turned off the misters though it was warmer than when we arrived, and it was ridiculously loud as the music volume was way high. 
The table next to us complained, too, but the waitress said the owner doesn't allow for any adjustments. 
Won't be back. Too many places with good food in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner tonight as well as excellent service. We shared the special - red snapper, mashed potatoes, and sautéed kale. Perfect! And our server Julia was awesome! She was there when we needed her - without hovering (a big plus) - gave us great recommendations and delivered exactly what we expected. High marks to the staff and chef! Only concern was that our reservation had been lost even tho we had confirmed earlier in the day. However, they accommodated us when we arrived and it was a non-issue. Kudos to all!!"}
{"text":"Their new Brunch is wonderful.  I went with my family, 7 of us and we shared everything since all the food was so good and refreshingly creative.  We also recommend the Champagne and Bloody Mary Bar and we tried another drink that tasted like an Orange Julius."}
{"text":"Same owners as Grassroots, but very different experience. Food is just ok and service is not top notch like Grassroots. I will stick with Grassroots for lunch."}
{"text":"Very 'meh'.  For being the top yelp rated restaurant, I was very let down.  Brought my whole family here for a get together hoping to \"wow\" them, but was quite ordinary.
The charred brussel sprouts were pretty good, but not as good as I was expecting after reading reviews.  Fish tacos were extremely ho-hum.  Salmon was decent.  We got a couple different flatbreads, but nobody cared much for them.  The best thing here...the mixed drink with tequila and cayenne salt (I forgot the name)."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. Everything was absolutely top notch. We started with the Brussels sprouts and the bruschetta then had the crab cakes and gnocci with a side of cauliflower grits. Finished with the tres leches cake. Nothing short of spectacular and I've been eating in Scottsdale for 20+ years. The vibe was great and the drinks were satisfyingly strong. I will certainly be back again soon."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Twisted Grove is one the best restaurants in the Valley. The food is excellent and the service is extraordinary!!  Unique favorite dishes include Grilled Brussel sprouts, Sauteed Cauliflower with glaxed onion, the Salmon, the drinks!!  Their specialty drinks are a treat!  Yes, I'll have another. Cheers. See you soon at The Twisted Grove."}
{"text":"Best crabcake in the valley. Went for lunch, sat at the bar. Great atmosphere, music and music level perfect, bartender Shaun was great with recommendations. Look forward to trying dinner in the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. food is incredible. 5 stars. I'd highly recommend this place. Fun vibe, really good food and service."}
{"text":"Just finished an excellent dinner. Atmosphere was very nice, perfect service and delicious food . Definitely a do again ."}
{"text":"went to lunch here last weekend.... I saw the high reviews and was expecting great food and service. The food was okay not bad... We sat at the bar, ordered 2 cocktails and the bartender didn't know how to make them, We saw her reading the menu to see what was in them. we were kinda disappointed."}
{"text":"Went yesterday at 4 p.m. for our office appreciation gathering of about 12 people.  The place has potential however, there were a few things that need work.  The waiter was not attentive enough and it wasn't even busy.  We quickly realized we should order items when they came to our table because we didn't know when we would see them again. The empty plates were not picked up, even after setting them to the side for them to be easily accessed.  We ordered several appetizers.  Several of us ordered the sliders.  I didn't really check to see how many came with the order so when I received one slider I was a little surprised but didn't think too much of it.  Talking about it today we realized we had no idea how they processed our order.  The men received two sliders each.  I received one slider and another co-worker received two.   Today we went online to check the menu we should have each received four each.  We didn't order as a group, we ordered individually.  When they were clearing our table a gal took two of the leftover drinks and THREW the remaining liquid into the bushes next to our table and then stacked the glasses about 6 glasses high. Unfortunately, she cut her finger on one of the broken glasses that someone had dropped.  I thought to myself, well she may end up with another broken glass the way they were stacked so high.  They are going to need to get things right or they won't be a success.  The sliders were great. Someone in our party tries the oysters and she really liked them."}
{"text":"Definitely a great \"hidden secret\" weekend brunch place, with zero wait late Saturday morning (unlike the packed Matt's across the plaza).

I ordered the French toast with a side of bacon.  The French toast serving consisted of three enormous slices with a crispy crust and yummy custardy interior, made even better with the accompanying butter and maple syrup.  The combination of crispy and gooey was truly fantastic, almost deep fried-level in its yumminess.

The bacon was nice and salty, but could have been a touch crispier.  It still had that melt in your mouth quality.

Service was really good, with the waitress offering to box my food and with my water being kept filled even after paying the check.

They have a nice sunny patio that seems pet friendly (a couple has their dog out there with them anyways).

Weird observation: There is a car parked in one of the spaces directly in front of the restaurant and the sun is reflecting off its windshield something fierce.  It's quite blinding."}
{"text":"Great food, love the atmosphere and Chris the bartender provided fantastic service! I will definitely come back and recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Fabulous brunch today! My sister and mother had the short rib hash and I had the veggie scramble called something odd but it was egg whites, greens and veggies. Delish! Service a bit slow so only Four stars. My other sis had the grouper sandwich which is always good!"}
{"text":"I liked the decor and atmosphere. I came for lunch and had the Grouper Sandwich (stacked with coleslaw, pickle and pickled onions) and Garlic Fries. Everything was awesome - very tasty!! The Fries came hot and fresh - great! I need to come back for dinner somand try the crab cakes or gnocchi and short ribs!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. We ordered a well-done steak from the kids menu for our daughter. It was cooked medium rare. We ordered fries. They came back with a strong Brussels sprouts or broccoli flavor. We told the waitress. She told us the fries are typically covered in garlic or Parmesan so you don't taste the flavor of the old oil. The waitress said she'd see what she could do. She brought us another batch of fries. This time, they were cooked in the same oil used to fry fish, so they had a strong fish flavor. I had the rotisserie chicken. It was slightly underdone, on the cold side and incorrectly deboned.  We didn't initially receive water with our meals. I requested water. The waitress brought me a glass of water, but nothing for the rest of the table. I could go on and on (the menu itself is goofy; every dish seemed to have at least one ingredient intended to offend the palate). The bottom line is this place should be avoided. It's sad because I like the sister restaurant Grassroots quite a bit. But this place is as close in quality to Grassroots as is the roller grill at 7-11."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place with the good ratings.  We had the happy hour slider, fish tacos and salmon poke.  Slider and fish tacos were average at best.  Salmon poke...didn't even finish it which is not how I was raised.  Poke should not taste and smell fishy.  I can see why they add so much spicy peppers and pickled onions to try to mask it.  Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Had terrific lunch with gal pal.great service , waitress so attentive but also willing to let us linger and chat,Loved the roasted cauliflower and broccolini as side choices  with lunch!  So good. Very generous portions. Loved the interior design and modern feel. It was a Saturday in July in Scottsdale so not crowded . Another local winner."}
{"text":"Amazing! My girls and I went here for drinks and dinner and we had the best customer service at the bar.The bartenders name was Chris and he was super helpful and was the cutest bartender ever! he made the best drinks and was very attentive. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good time with delicious drinks!"}
{"text":"Very neat place.  Definitely more spendy, but they have a higher end menu.  
No ranch available for fries, and the citrus aoli instead was ok, not great.  
I look forward to going back and trying out more of their options."}
{"text":"Man oh Man what a good time! What a good damn time! A few Fridays ago, we celebrated one of my good friend's birthday.  The ambiance, the food, the red wine, the people dining there, the staff ... everyone made it such a good night and fun time.  We were a party of 5 women.  We started with a few glasses of red wine and a bruschetta board at the bar while we waited to be seated.  

Once we were seated, we ordered more red wine *smile* and shared a few appetizers and small plates. We shared the Charred Brussels Sprouts, Salmon + Wonder Salad, Crab Cakes & Greens and Twisted Oysters.  The Twisted Oysters and Charred Brussels Sprouts were mouthwatering good.  Spot on perfect!  We all ordered our own entrees but shared everything because that's how we do!  The crab cakes were so damn good as an appetizer that we ordered the entrée version as well.  We ordered the Crab Cakes, Gnocchi & Short Ribs, Sol-Cal Swordfish and Scottish Salmon. I'm so happy to say we LOVED every single thing everyone ordered.  There were no complaints at all.  None!  Of all the entrees, my favorites were the Crab Cakes and Sol-Cal Swordfish.  The Swordfish ... crazy good!  The Crab Cakes had very little filler, no breading and great on flavor.  They were perfect!  We never waited too long for anything.  Our server was so attentive and helped us have such a good time.  

Before asking for our checks, the server remembered that it was our friend's birthday and was kind enough to bring out a nice slice of Chocolate Cheesecake with candles and Happy Birthday Cassandra written on it.  It was such a nice surprise for our friend and our friend was kind enough to share that huge slice with all of us lol ..... So ... Happy Birthday to us   It was a perfect dinner.  A perfect pre-gaming time because we continued the party a little later at a bar on 7th!  Thank you Twisted Grove ... Can't wait to do it all over again."}
{"text":"Mom's Night Out at Twisted Grove.  There were 12 of us so I give the waitress kudos for getting all the orders right the first time.  We started with a small plate of the common ground burrata w/the creamiest mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes.  Delicious.  Spinach and bacon salad for dinner which was plenty of food.  This is going to sound silly, but it had the most amazing homemade croutons I've ever eaten.  I'd go back just for those!!  A friend had the Scottish salmon and was very pleased.  She chose spaghetti squash for her side and wished she'd chosen something else more so because of texture than flavor. 
 The tab was about $40/person (we had a few who weren't drinking) which I thought was pretty reasonable.  No room for dessert so I'll have to go back."}
{"text":"I came on a Thursday night and the place was PACKED! The ambiance is great. Very contemporary with an open kitchen. I honestly came here because I was craving oysters. We got both styles of oysters (shucked and cooked with spinach). I had a crab cake salad that was delicious as well as a sweet and spicy drink that could have been more spicy but was good nonetheless! Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant. Just finished lunch Amber was our waitress, super nice, great recommendations, and fabulous service. Definitely coming back while we're in town."}
{"text":"As usual, in search of a new place -found this place .And on reviews , we took a chance .They got really classy ambience and very spacious bar area along with the outside seating. One can find a rack of books at entrance which you can pick and leave while stepping out.

Coming to the food, we ordered iced green tea with angry bird flat bread which is yummy and eggplant stack for vegetarian guys accompanied with some French fries topped with parm cheese and herbs. We also tried roasted cauliflower which is ok for my taste buds. Allover our experience is nice and YES!! recommended place who are looking to hang out on weekends."}
{"text":"Another solid concept from the creator of Grassroots Kitchen and Tap. The menu offers solid options from both land and sea, and drawls for the masses. If you have been to this location in the past (Spotted Donkey, and more recently Scottsdale Station), it will be easy to recognize how much better the space is being utilized by Twisted. Plenty of booths, tables, and bar space give this well lit space a welcoming vibe. The patio, although west facing, is a great place to enjoy a dozen oysters and a pint before catching a spring training game right down the street. 

We dined around 7:15, and the place was popping. Considering the restaurant had just opened a few weeks before, the service was on par. The owner, GM, and service manager all did quality checks on our table to ensure we were having an enjoyable dining experience. This is something many restaurants fail to do, and it shows the quality of restaurant service the owner has established throughout his other locations. 

Our tables favorite items were the Crab Cakes (fuckin bomb), Twisted Noodle Salad, and the Pork Chop. 

The wine and beer list is on point as well. Cocktails are very reasonably priced (especially during happy hour), and the house lemonades will surely quench your sober thirst. 

If you can't find something on the menu that looks appealing, then you probably shouldn't eat out. Ever."}
{"text":"Dined in for lunch only so far.  I'll definitely go back.  Food and service were great!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  Took a handful of clients.  Atmosphere was cool service was great and food was yummy.  Rarely do I have a good crab cake and this was awesome.  My companions had lasagna that was fab eggplant stack yum and chicken BLT

All good very unique menu. One item is a gnocchi&ashore rib sounds delicious so looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant!!! I think this is gonna be the place that finally sticks in this plaza. We came here for brunch on Sunday and already can't wait to go back for more. The interior, menu and service could all be described as sophisticated yet relaxed. Our server Kaitlyn (I'm pretty sure that was her name) was awesome and went above and beyond packing up some of the amazing house made hot sauce to go for us. We tried the day break drive which was a perfect light and healthy breakfast but also satisfying (black beans, veggies galore, super yummy potatoes, eggs whites and a lil parm) and the crab cake Benedict which was also top notch. We watched someone else get a bruschetta board and we definitely want to come back for that. Their happy hour menu looks like it has lots of great food options on it and you can tell they put a lot of love into the food. We live around the corner and have a feeling we will be here a lot. Very happy to have twisted grove in the arcadia neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for  dinner. Ordered the bruschetta board . I didn't find it particularly interesting-- bread too hard and too much arugula topping .
We liked our burger, crab cake salad and eggplant sandwich and frites though. 
The place seemed popular, yet service not rushed.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. It was a little loud for conversations. Food was amazing. I had the Picnic chicken and raw oysters. Twisted hour (Happy Hour) is from 3 to 6 PM great prices on lots of stuff."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.   Went for brunch been excited to try new place close to home.  The waitress was not personable at all.  Did not even offer or explain brunch options or the Bloody Mary bar option.  Every thing I found out I had to drag out of her.  She acted like she did not even want to wait on us.   Then I asked for my egg poached medium.   She actually said \"this is not like Matt's Big Breakfast\"   We don't cook eggs like that.  WTH??   Who ever heard of not being able to order a medium cooked egg.   She said only poached runny or fried hard was available. We just left.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch with friends.  Charred brussel sprouts are a speciality and outstanding!  Excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"I came here with my two cousins on a Wednesday night. It was warm out so we sat on the patio which was really nice. The servers are all really nice and service was good. We started off with cocktails, I had the first one on the menu (grapefruit vodka drink) and it was good. My cousin got the sweet and spicy which I tried and that was amazing. The cayenne pepper rim is the perfect fit for it. 

Yelpers raved about the brussel sprouts so we tried those and they did NOT disappoint! So delicious with a balsamic reduction sauce. I love my brussels crispy and these definitely had a char. For dinner I got the mushroom paparadelle and it was Fantastic! So flavorful and fresh. I would 100% get this again. One of my cousins got the crab cake salad which he enjoyed a lot. The crab cake was crispy. My other cousin got the cobb salad and she did not like it at all. She loves cobb salads which are always so flavorful because there is so much going on, and for some reason this salad had NO taste whatsoever. She said she would not get that again but would come back based on tasting our meals and having the brussel sprouts.

On a side note, they have private rooms for events and we hope they start having live music outside because its a great area for it."}
{"text":"This was a great place for a work lunch! The atmosphere was casual and fun and it wasn't overly crowded. The service was amazing and fast. The crispy grouper sandwich was delicious! The coleslaw is a little strong so be aware if you don't like that. Overall it was really enjoyable."}
{"text":"Decent spot for lunch or dinner. I had the cavatelli carbonara, which was excellent. I also ordered a side of grilled broccolini, which I thought would have been better with a bit less mustard. My husband had the paparedelle with wild mushrooms and it was extremely bland. The caprese flat bread pizza was a great starter and service was friendly, efficient and quick."}
{"text":"First time. Met up with an old buddy of mine that was in the area for a meeting. We both needed to unwind after a crazy week. Twisted Grove was perfect! Our mixologist Brian was attentive and made some phenomenal cocktails. La Paloma was my favorite, citrusy sweet with reposada taquilla. The interior was clean and not to modern with natural lighting, chill atmosphere with a great outside patio. Haven't eaten here yet but that will be my next order of business. Great spot for a quick drink or a casual business meeting if it's cool with your company, that is. Don't miss out on the Paloma."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the cauliflower with tahini side dish in fact I ordered a second batch it was so good! My friends short ribs were amazing! Best of all the welcoming and laid-back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is awesome. Very decadent, clean, hip, and not to expensive."}
{"text":"Ok so this is the first time I've written a second review on a restaurant. I really wanted this restaurant to be great tonight. I made a reservation a few days in advance for myself and hubby, 3 sons and one teenage son's girlfriend. I have tried making  his published short rib recipe before and it has come out wonderfully.. was anxious to taste it again . 
Hostess was friendly, smiled asked for a few minutes and  and then within minutes sat us...awesome. That's why there is one star. Then unfortunately Heidi our waitress came over but the only way we knew her name was from the bill at the end. No \"hello\" , no \"introduction\"
No small talk. Just \"
What do you want to drink\". My husband and I immediately tried to be extra friendly to win her over since our last visit here had bad service. She slowly started to get a bit more friendlier as the night got on and we asked her opinions of the menu choices. Here were the major problems... we noticed there was a gluten free bread option so we asked if the bruschetta could be made on gluten free bread. She had no idea. The answer back from the kitchen was \" ok but it won't look pretty\". We were totally fine with that. Appetizers were brussel sprouts which were good but a little dry . GF bruschetta was good. Then we ordered. The special was sea bass and mushroom risotto and it was bland. Two kids had salmon and said it was ok. My son's prime rib was dry. I of course asked for the short ribs which I always order if on a menu and since I make his recipe at home
Had to try it again. The short ribs come with gnocchi which I said they could just keep off or substitute with mashed potatoes.  You would've thought I asked for oil to be mixed with vinegar. The answer from the kitchen was an absolute no and I am very easy going and said no problem just bring me a side of mashed potatoes which for some reason she wasn't understanding. So I slowly said ok just bring me the dish with a side of mashed potatoes.  I'm not celiac at all just sensitive . Well I was glad I had the short ribs because now I know for sure mine are way better!  I was surprised that they cut the ribs into smaller pieces from last year and some were fatty. Well we all ate and left full but never had that great experience that made us want to stay and linger with coffee and dessert. Unlike the first review I wrote, the dishes were picked up timely. Just lacking that smiling waitress, that great food experience and that kitchen that wants the local business. Sorry! Too many other great restaurants here to try. Won't visit again."}
{"text":"Went to the Twisted Grove this past weekend with family on recommendation of my Brother-In-Law. The place is huge and wasn't particularly crowded for a Friday night. We had great service, since they had plenty of staff on hand and I really enjoyed the meal. We all shared some bruschetta to start, and most of the flavors we got I liked, but my favorite was the honey ricotta one. Some of the others didn't quite hit it out of the park. My sister and I shared the carbonara, and I loved the addition of brussel sprouts, which were a dominate player on the menu. In fact, the whole place smelled of brussel sprouts when we walked in... I didn't hate it.

For dessert, my Husband insisted on trying the tres leches cake, which is a personal favorite of his. I found it to be ok, but could use more moisture, which is what tres leches is known for. I think we will be back, but I love it's sister restaurant, Grassroots a bit more, but we will surely give this restaurant another try."}
{"text":"I ate here last night with two friends. Two of us had the crab cake and greens. One had the swordfish special. All delicious, but it would have been nice to have tartar sauce or some other delicious concoction to accompany the crab cake. And it would be nice if they added a non-alcoholic beer to the drink menu. Very good service."}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here today. Fabulous service. Fabulous lunch. We shared both the chicken BLT and the Spinach Salad. They were simply delicious. We also split the Butterscotch Pecan Pie for dessert; one of my favorite desserts ever."}
{"text":"Twisted Grove had me at candied bacon in the charred brussels sprouts.  They had my husband at the fresh Alaskan oysters.  We went to Twisted Grove for Arizona Restaurant Week, and will be going back for the excellent service and food.  I had the Gnocchi and Short Ribs  which were melt in your mouth tender and so flavorful.  He had the So-Cal Swordfish which was \"probably the best swordfish\" he's ever had.  Butterscotch Pecan Pie...to die for.  The one teeny bite of my husband's Tres Leches Cake was also yummy.  They also know how to make a fabulous dirty martini.  Our server (and I apologize for forgetting her name) was awesome.  Good with recommendations, knowledgeable, and attentive without being intrusive...she was fantastic.  The only criticism I have is that the restaurant is very loud.  We actually sat on the patio so we could have a conversation and it was lovely."}
{"text":"Crab eggs Benedict was great for brunch and the hot roast beef is some of the best in the areas.  Bartender Caitlin is always friendly and makes a great martini..great place for a date or a happy hour.."}
{"text":"I don't have a single complaint about this place. The food was amazing!! We shared the artichoke appetizer, mushroom flatbread, had cauliflower as a side, and for main dish the wild mushroom pasta. Finished with dulce de leche. I can't wait to go back!! Definitely a place I would be confident ordering anything off their menu because it was all equally great food."}
{"text":"The menu is so great- we wanted to try one of everything. I tried the blueberry shandy and my husband tried the victory lap which was made with patron, agave, red jalapeño- it was delicious. 
We started with the brussels sprouts- big chunks of bacon and charred to perfection. The homemade ricotta gnocchi with short ribs was phenomenal. A hint of heat added with some jalapeño. The wild mushroom flatbread and the crispy grouper sandwich were also part of our meal- equally as outstanding. This place is such an amazing addition to the neighborhood- not to mention a gorgeous restaurant. Can't wait to come back to try the bruschettas, oysters and monkey bread dessert!  yum."}
{"text":"Twisted Grove is fantastic. The food, the service, prices, etc.

We had to evaluate the Brussels sprouts. We'd heard a lot and this was the moment of truth. I won't keep you waiting. They are otherworldly, amazing. Get three orders and call it dinner.
And dessert! Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"The parking at the Biltmore Plaza can get A lil sparce, so plan accordingly. This location had a history of unsuccessful restaurants, so we are cheering for TGPB to make it! We love Grassroots, so we were excited to come here for lunch. Server was attentive... our ice tea glasses were never less than half empty before  they topped it off. Plus, they checked in on us regularly (but not too ofen).  We all enjoyed the charred brussel sprouts - the candied bacon & balsamic reduction cut the bitterness if you are not a fan of brussel sprouts. Our table ordered the roasted chix BLT which comes open faced with the bun top on the side if you want to limit your carb count. The Arcadia club was ok, but it had too much smoked ham and lil or no roasted turkey to make it more well balanced sandwich. The fries were battered to gibe it that extra crunch - no ketchup needed. The star of the table was the sun cobb salad as we all wanted a bite of all the delicious + fresh chunks of ingredients.  Looking forward to our next dining opportunity. We didn't have any room for desserts, but we will make room if they offer the same brownie as Grassroots!"}
{"text":"We finally tried this place for the first time today. The crabcake Benedict on the brunch menu was delicious the short rib hash was also good. The bloody Mary bar was fun, and Matt the bartender took excellent care of us. If you've not already, suggest you give this place a try for brunch."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at the Twisted Grove. Immediately I was impressed with the restaurant itself. Lights hung on the outside patio with space heaters for a nice outside ambiance. Inside was even classier. 

The service was attentive and knowledgeable. Our server even gave us a free app because it was our first time in.  

The Sunny Cobb Salad fell below my expectations. The wild mushroom pappardelle was good, but not great. The noodles were cooked perfectly, but the sauce lacked flavor. I also am not a fan of the single stall bathrooms and the shared sinks. (but that's just a preference) 

Overall, it was a good experience but I would need to go back before I could recommend it."}
{"text":"Twisted Grove is a good, but not overly impressive restaurant. It has a rustic feel with a large bar in the center. Sports play on all the flat screens and there is a full page of liquor options.

The avocado bruschetta was delicious, but the mascarpone and goat cheese choices fell short. 

There was some confusion with our waiter as well. I thought I ordered the wild mushroom pappardelle and instead got the cavatelli carbonara with lobster. Luckily I was considering the second option and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink the other day with a friend...emjoyed the gorgeous patio!! Although we only had drinks, the menu was super enticing!! I'll have to return to try some grub:)"}
{"text":"Friend and I had lunch here yesterday and had wonderful service. Tyler was so helpful in telling us about the menu items and recommending dishes. He even got my friend to try and like the brussel sprouts.  He would get a 5 out of 5.  Loved the atmosphere - menu was a little limiting for me - I would have preferred more salad selection. Definitely worth a try - glad we did.  Thank you Tyler!!"}
{"text":"Twisted Grove was great! John the bartender is such a sweetie. He hooked us up with the Brussel Sprout appetizer and it was delicious. It has candied bacon in it! Loved the presentation too. I had the crab cake and greens and a side of the spaghetti squash. Perfect size portions and awesome flavors. Fleur de lis cocktail in the frosty glass!!  Husband had the French dip sandwich. He said it was good but the portion could've been bigger. 
All around a win win!"}
{"text":"Had fantastic service, had a reservation on a Friday night at 7:30 and got seated immediately. Couldn't decide on an entree so my friend and I split the Short Ribs and Gnocchi and the Lobster Roll. All of it was FANTASTIC. Short Ribs and Gnocchi was very rich, so glad we split it! And the Lobster Roll wasn't lacking in the but delicious juicy bites of lobster. We also split a bruschetta flight and all were fantastic... the avocado one I want to replicate at home!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent selection to dine with my family following a spring training baseball game. The glazed Brussel sprouts with a crab cake salad were my healthy selection while assorted flatbreads on ceramic-like serving dishes were picked by others in my family. Excellent food and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Food and service fantastic! We are always on the prowl for high quality food Twisted Grove does not disappoint. We always do the bar met Katie and Mathew. Mathew knew every dish and was very happy to share thoughts and recommendations. This not a standard food menu.Great variety and excellent quality!"}
{"text":"A Mother's Day disaster.  As a big fan of Grassroots Tap & Kitchen I was excited to take my mother, wife, and two kids to try out it's new sister restaurant Twisted Grove for Mother's Day.  This is no Grassroots Tap.  At best maybe an evil step-sister.  Nothing came out hot or even warm.  Everything we ordered ranged from room temperature to downright cold when it hit the table.  That is what made it to the table as not everything we ordered actually arrived.  Despite our dinner we WERE going to order some dessert to celebrate the holiday.  That never happened as the bill arrived and was dropped on the table without asking whether or not we wanted dessert or how our we liked the dinner.  This place has a lot of work ahead of it to be acceptable.  No thanks."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time during Restaurant Week, and will certainly come back. The prix fixe menu included items from their regular menu, and they were all terrific. I especially loved the blackened swordfish, and also the bite I stole of my companion's pecan pie. Tip: there's plenty of parking on the north side of the restaurant (use the harder-to-spot north driveway into the center)."}
{"text":"OMG - best place ever!!! Service at the bar was wonderful, as Joseph was our bartender.  He was attentive and very helpful when he found out this was our first time here. He helped us during happy hour and pointed out the specials and great food values.  Tried the brussels sprouts and they were great - bacon makes everything better and the balsamic reduction was awesome. Ventured onto the short rib gnocchi and thought we had died and gone to heaven!  Tried the oysters, they were the large variety and nothing to brag about.... Joseph the bartender definitely helped elevate our experience - also try the fish tacos at happy hour - in house made pickled onions on them - sounds weird but delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The gnocchi and short rib is atop the list of my best meals of 2017.  The waitress said the secret was to order it with a side of grilled cheese which was absolutely fantastic.  The appetizers were kind of lame and uninspired other thank the brussel sprouts, which were still kind of lame, and that's why I can only give this 4 stars."}
{"text":"I came here initially for a work event that was catered. I was surprised and delighted by the quality of the food here so I brought my husband with me for a date night. We started with the bruschetta and artichoke which were delicious. Their cocktails are fabulous and tasty. I had the mushroom papardelle pasta and husband had the chicken. Both were delicious. We ended the meal with the cookies and milk. Yum! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Always in for a variety of foods, a few of us shared the crab and greens, angry bird flatbread and 4 sides ( roasted cauliflower, creamed spinach, spaghetti squash and garlic smashed potatoes). 

Crab and greens: nice amount of fresh crab lumps throughout the cake; light breading which is preferable and fresh greens such as the arugula nuttiness. $17 perfect light salad. 

Angry bird: crusty crispy flatbread made with a delicious noice at every bite; with white and dark meat of a rotisserie chicken, basil, cheese and tabasco sauce. Cut into 8 pieces. 

4 Sides: spaghetti squash was cool and refreshing side with shallot lemon butter reggiano but didn't taste any of the lemon butter; roasted cauliflower was smothered in  garlic tahini sauce and charred onions and it on the salty side; smashed potatoes had bacon bits and scallions and cheese which gave a good carb; creamed spinach had artichoke and creamed reggiano cheese which tasted like any other creamed spinach and could have some pita chips to compliment this. $16

Water were always filled except towards end. I was about to take a pic of the menu but the server grabbed it and took it away! Too funny! Sorry no picture for this but at least there are plenty others. 

Overall great casual experience and good food."}
{"text":"Nice 10/pitcher happy hour special.  Oysters were well cleaned and fresh.  Waiter was great.  I would definitely go again if in the area."}
{"text":"I had lunch Sunday at TGP&G and was quite impressed.  My rather fussy companion had the crabcake and announced that she'd never had better.  The special was a delicious meatball and pasta dish, very tasty and nicely presented.  A real highlight was our excellent server, Stacy.  Professional, knowledgeable, and at the same time, spirited and friendly.  Absolutely first-rate.  I live in the neighborhood and plan to return often."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We frequent here often and everything I've ever had has been delicious! The short run gnocchi is one of my all time favorite dishes and their crab cake was almost all crab and little breading which is just how it should be! The staff is friendly and helpful! Definitely highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Can I add another star?! Great service, incredible food. We'll be in town 4 days & we've been there twice at different times. Phenomenal bruschetta board. Ya gotta try the avocado. Twisted noodle salad w/steak. OMG! Great flavors. Two types of tea: black & green. Wife & I shared the Roasted chicken BLT & broccolini (sauce is awesome). Open, comfortable, & easy going atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food, nice service. Love that kids eat free during happy hour and get free scoops of ice cream next door!"}
{"text":"Came here just a few days ago after hearing a million and one things about their brussel sprouts. This would actually be my second time trying Twisted Grove, as the first time was when they sent us food complimentary for us to try it out on the day of their grand opening! I'll start with the things I tried that day: 

Sausage Onion Flatbread: When I tried this, it was actually a little cold but I still loved it so much! It still had the creaminess from the whole milk mozzarella; the sausage added the perfect hint of spice to this creamy savory treat and the onion added a nice crunch! 

Arcadia Club (I think): OMG I don't even know what it was about this sandwich but my mouth waters just thinking about it. Maybe it was the quality of the meat used? I took a bite into this sandwich and all of the cold fresh ingredients melted in my mouth- such amazing fresh flavor. I am actually guessing that what I had was the Arcadia Club, it's the only thing on the menu that was similar, I just don't remember any tomato in there- it's likely that I got the slice without tomato.

Second time around, I came back to try the oysters and a round of appetizers:  

Bruschetta Board: I really enjoyed this! On the menu, there are five categories of bruschetta and you get to pick 3- they brought this cut into three pieces each so me and the boo could share, which was nice (not sure if they charge extra for that). We went with the avocado, burrata, and mascarpone. My favorite was the avacado- it came with a wedge of lime and was very refreshing! Was not a huge fan of the burrata, felt like the flavor was missing something. 

Brussels: Saving the best for last. I LOVED THESE SO MUCH! It was my first time ever having brussel sprouts charred; we actually make brussel sprouts at home daily but bake them. These were crunchy on the outside + soft on the inside, dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette which had a lemon flavor- it was perfect with the garlic flavor on the brussels!  

Twisted Oysters: This was my first time trying broiled oysters & I'm more of a fresh oyster kind of girl; no comment. 

Fresh Oysters: This is where I was a little disappointed. We ordered a half dozen of these even though we didn't need to because we definitely had enough food! The waitress was not able to tell us where the oysters were from- we actually asked after we got them and didn't even realize that she did not tell us that when we were ordering them. The oysters had a cream consistency and the liquid around it was also a foggy cream/white color... We are definitely fresh oyster lovers but this was so bad. Maybe we didn't have the taste for this specific oyster (I'm sure), but now we can't even watch out for this kind of oyster at any other restaurant since we don't know the name! 

Creamed Spinach: This is one of the things I didn't feel strongly about because it had artichokes in it and the consistency/flavor reminded me a little too much of spinach & artichoke dip. I ended up eating it with the leftover bruschetta crumbs though and that was pretty yummy.

Definitely coming back for that sandwich!"}
{"text":"Got good reviews on Yelp, so we decided to give a try.  Good parking available on a Tuesday evening.  Got seated immediately with no reservation.  Both indoor and outdoor seating available.  Nice craft beer selection, although few local to Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  My wife ordered the crab cakes and I went with short rib gnochi.  Both were very good, crab cakes could have been seared a bit more to give a crispier outer layer, but the roasted cauliflower with tahini side was best she ever tasted.  Creamed spinach side also very good.  The short rib gnochi was fabulous with plenty of meat and a balanced amount of pasta with a great dark sauce and a variety of veggie and spice bits mixed in.  Had the caramel pecan pie which was good but not as wonderful as the name implied.  Overall a very nice dining experience and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. The decor and vibe is perfect. Ownership knocked it out of the park again. It's Monday night and there is a wait which I am happy about. This space has seen many start and fail restaurants. 

We started with the artichokes which were pure amazing.  I washed it down with the crab cakes and WOW I was very happy. I know that everyone was happy with dinner. 

In to desert. Chocolate chunk cookies on a wood plank served with house made chocolate milk. Yep!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and terrible service. If you were ever hoping to get a slice of Scottsdale here in Phoenix, check out Twisted Grove. You will have a decent meal coupled with inhospitable service. I would suggest taking it to go, but considering how high the prices are, this place has no excuses. Our server forgot to deliver one of the appetizers. As the main course arrived we notified him of the error, to which he replied that it would be taken care of. The appetizer was dropped at the end of the meal with no apology, and subsequently still charged for our appetizer turned dessert. Since we were done with our entrees they took all the plates as well, so our desserttizer was plate-less. Our server never checked in or asked us if we wanted another beer, either, until he dropped the check. 

Great water service. 

If you are nearby, check out Delux, Beckets Table, Hillstone, or the plethora of other options in the area that understand you don't go to a restaurant just for great food... (that is what supermarkets are for). Service is part of the equation."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Charred brussel sprouts were a bit too chard but still delicious. Flatbread, broccolini, squash, fries, bruschetta were all good.  Bourbon pecan pie was one of the best I've had. So good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I haven't written a review for this place yet even though it is one of my favorite restaurants. My boyfriend and a few of our friends absolutely love the bruschetta board and the sweet & spicy margaritas. We had gone hiking prior to visiting today and drinking did not sound like a good idea because I felt dehydrated. Anyway, our main go-to's for the bruschetta are the ones that include: mascarpone, burrata, and goat cheese. The one with mascarpone, walnuts, fig and arugula is my absolute favorite. It is almost like a dessert! 

I'm a big fan of crab cakes and this place knows what they are doing with it! Also, they just started serving brunch and we tried the Eggs in Purgatory this afternoon - So delicious! We would definitely order it again! It was such a comforting dish and it would be perfect for anyone with a hangover. Maybe we will go again tomorrow :)

Anyway, we left an envelope there during our visit and didn't realize it until a few hours later. The manager, Richard, was SO HELPFUL. He definitely provided outstanding customer service. I can't believe how far he went to find us that envelope. He went through surveillance footage and went dumpster diving for us. Who does that??? Well, Richard did that and we are so thankful. The oysters are good, the grilled cheese board is yummy, and I really enjoy the tri-tip sandwich. I heard the owner of this place is also the owner of Grassroots, which is in the same shopping center. We frequent there for lobster bisque on Fridays and I love getting the farmer's chop salad with salmon at Grassroots. 

My boyfriend and I went to dinner at a steakhouse to celebrate our anniversary tonight. Unfortunately, we did not really enjoy our meal tonight at BLT Steak. We left early and just came back home to relax after a long day. I don't know why we didn't think to just come back to Twisted Grove tonight for our special evening. We screwed up. We would have had a much better meal and better time. 

Long story short, I recommend Twisted Grove to anyone. The GM Richard went above and beyond for us and we definitely appreciated it. We are more than happy with this place. 

Now go get yourself a Sweet & Spicy margarita."}
{"text":"I am so happy to find such a nice place.  My wonderful new neighbors invited me to join them recently for happy hour.  

The cocktails were so good.  We only had the happy hour food and it was good. 

All the people there were so nice.  The bartender not only makes great cocktails but she is an amazing lady and it was so nice to talk with her.  I can't wait to go back.  The menu looks amazing."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and each time have had fantastic experiences!  I would highly recommend the Brussel sprout appetizer- it's phenomenal!  The crab cakes are amazing with pure, fresh, delightful crabmeat.  I have ordered this 2 out of the 3 times!   I have mine with a side of spaghetti squash since I'm allergic to tomatoes.   The frites are super good, too!  

The 3rd time, I ordered the special - a lobster bisque risotto, which was good, but they had to leave off one of the sauces due to my allergy.  I think it would have been better with, but that's not their fault, obviously.

The desserts are incredible- I've had the Tres Leches cake and the pecan 
 pie cheesecake,  which I liked better.  

I really like this restaurant and can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure there's crack in the gnocchi with short ribs because I NEED to go go it again fast!!! Pork chop also great...sub the squash for creamed spinach. Yum! The house Angry sauce on the raw oysters was delightful. Warm cookies with chocolate milk was a great finish. We'll be back!!! Only wish is that they had more AZ beers to choose from. Drink Local AZ!!!"}
{"text":"Another home run from Christopher Collins!

Every dish is superb. Service is spot on perfect. The room is beautiful and calming.

This restaurant is a must try!"}
{"text":"Oysters were great and a good value on Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Ordered the twisted noodle salad to go and when I got home both salads were missing the noodle... this is the second time they have messed up our order."}
{"text":"Slow service, food was of poor quality. My \"crab cake Hollandaise\" consisted of small pieces of crab and not \"crab cake\". Not enough Hollandaise, and room temp. Would not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Had the brussel sprouts, Angry Bird flatbread, and the gnocci entree. All were amazing."}
{"text":"I've never heard of this place (mostly because I don't typically dine in this area), but now I'm committed to returning-and with reinforcements! 

Slightly upscale, myself and two friends sat on their patio for a sunset dinner. We never felt too hot as the section was still cooled and it happened to be a lovely day. Our server was really funny without trying! 

I ate two appetizers as my dinner: the artichokes with citrus aioli and their French onion soup. Both were very flavorful. The artichokes would've been better to share as it took me a long time to eat them - both my friends finished their dinners well before I did! I ordered my French onion soup without the ciabatta to decrease the carb count. This caused the huge portion of cheese to hide at the bottom of my soup, but what a pleasant surprise! The broth tasted like drippings from slow roasted beef- super deep and savory!

Did I mention... HEAPS OF CHEESE!

I will be bringing my husband here as we are self-titled connoisseurs of FOS (French onion soup, of course!) Can't wait until round two!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool place.  The food and Bloody Mary's were great.  Pretty neat atmosphere as well.  Its relatively small inside, but in a comfortable way.  The servers were quick, knowledgeable , and polite.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Found this by accident and sure glad we did!  We wanted to go to an area that we wouldn't have a problem parking and this was it.  Charming restaurant.  We used to go to this location when it was a great BBQ place; but now it is totally changed.  Some yelpers complained about the price.  I thought it was pretty right for 2016!  Portions were just fine.  I liked that they had two sizes of salads and that they were also delish!  Last time I had a flat bread with mixed cheeses and a variety of sautéed mushrooms.  It was so big, I brought half home and actually ate it the next day!  I usually don't eat left overs and end up throwing them out.  Not this time.  As far as service, they are weak with their hostess or host.  however; we had Maya, and she was nice, adorable and a good attentive server.  For a lite lunch or lite dinner, I think in it's category of casual restaurants, it is excellent and would not hesitate to recommend it!
I almost forgot to mention that their parmesan fries are fresh, crispy and excellent!  They came with my husband's club sandwich, which might have been the best one he's ever eaten!  I agree.  It just worked!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here on a last minute date night. Since we didn't have a reservation, we were seated at one of the community tables (otherwise it would have been a 40 minute wait). The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, the staff were all very kind, and we are so happy we decided to stop in and give this place a try. 

We ordered the brussel sprouts and a bruschetta board to start. The brussel sprouts were awesome... truly some of the best that I have tried in a while. And out of all of the places in Scottsdale/PHX currently trying to rival Postino's bruschetta, these guys did it. It was all delicious. 

My husband and I opted to share the wild mushroom pappardelle. I wish I had just kept this order to myself. I did NOT want to share it. If we weren't at a community table, I would have licked the plate with zero shame. 

We finished up with the tres leches cake. Truly... no words. 

The beer selection was really good, and they have Schramsberg Mirabelle Rose. So they win in my book. ;) I thought that this place would be overpriced bar food. Absolutely not the case. Great atmosphere with super reasonable pricing for such amazing food! This is going to be a go-to spot for us."}
{"text":"The sweet n' spicy is CRAZY GOOD.  It's a perfect blend of mouth-fire and sweet.  Food was pretty tasty too.  My flatbread was delicious.   

I have to give credit to our server who dealt with my goofy answer of \"a pony\" when he asked if there was *anything* else he could get us.  (He asked!)  Once he understood I was joking, he rolled with it.  

Great place and I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day. Just had dinner at the twisted fork. Spectacular char grilled sprouts. BUT.....one would think for $13.00, at a Scottsdale establishment, one would get at least one olive in ones martini.....not even a toothpick."}
{"text":"We had lunch today , and the food was extremely good ! 

One star off because of their huge fly problem on the patio . Made $100 lunch kinda sad . ( at least 6 flies ) 

Hopefully management & owners can kick this issue . 

Was told \"it was the great out doors \" by server when I mentioned the issue LOL ."}
{"text":"One word: carbonara. Creamy, cheesy, bacon goodness with an egg on top. Sooooooo good. I was sad it had to come to an end. My friend got the rotisserie chicken and it was very tasty as well! I'm excited to come back and try the gnocchi and short ribs too. 

Also, 3-6 is happy hour! They have a really good selection of appetizers and drinks for cheap."}
{"text":"The food was great. We ordered the lump crab cakes. So full of crab and absolutely delicious!  The service was good, very friendly and informative. They were busy for a Wednesday night, however no wait to get seated. The restaurant was loud and a tad expensive, but I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Twisted Grove is literally around the corner from me, and I find myself here for dinner solo at least a few times a month. Somehow being alone in a busy restaurant with good food gives me the reflection-time I crave after especially stressful days at work.  

If you're lucky enough to get there in time for happy hour, spoil yourself with the oysters! You won't be disappointed. They are fresh and shucked right in front of you. It is not the weird Arizona--seafood?? feeling that I find sometimes at other establishments, these are fresh and delicious and make me happy when I can get there in time. 

I vary between the crab cake and salmon with Cesar salad, though I've experimented with most items on the menu. It is just an easy feel-good salad, order the small and you'll be satisfied without being overly stuffed. Again, these options are fresh and delicious seafood options, you can taste the quality in the first bite. 

My favorite bartender is Stacey, she is super sweet.  She is the perfect bartender who knows how to chat while still taking cues if I'm not quite in the mood or busy flipping through work emails. 

The cocktails are wonderful, the crowd is always happy, and the service is always spot-on. I'm so lucky to live nearby!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Not processed or ordinary. I have been pleasantly surprised here. We need more places like this around. We bring our small dog here as well and they take care of him too! Beer selection is good. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the short ribs and gnocchi! My husband got the parpadelle mushroom pasta which was very good as well. Would come back a second time!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is fabulous! We love the cauliflower and the carbonara. Great happy hour. Great beverages. Service is fantastic. Chris, at our recent visit where we sat at the bar, was on top of it!  Very friendly and made great recommendations. We will be back!  Thanks Chris!"}
{"text":"I loved the food and service. Hostess was not aware that she gave us a booth with no server available. When we asked if we could sit in the patio she said it was not open yet ( tables were set??) we decided then to sit in a booth by the bar but no one came to the table until we asked for a server. Once the server came he was amazing and gave us a great service. We loved the food and the ambiance."}
{"text":"When I saw this restaurant open close to me house, I decided to come and check it out.  I love the atmosphere of this restaurant off of 32nd Street and Camelback in the Baltimore area.  

My first waitress was Bria was amazing and knew everything about the menu make sure my water was always full and everything was perfect.  Since then I started coming back to Twisted and Grove once a week.  Everything that I have had already has been amazing.   If you go for Happy Hour you should try the Grill Cheese Bites with bacon and avocado on it.  Even the drinks are excellent too.  

If you are new to town or have friends or family in town.  You should definitively take them to Twisted and Grove."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at this charming restaurant.  Decor is hip without being too edgy. Crowd is across the age spectrum.  The brussel sprouts were a dream. But the short ribs with gnocchi was quite simply the best thing I've ever tasted. Travis, our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We tried it again. The Vesper martini is still good  I had a sauvignon blanc and petit sirah, both good. My wife had a sliced steak sandwich: great and our dog appreciated the leftover piece. I had a sausage and onion flatbread: good. The Brussels sprout side was good. Service was excellent. The place is really really noisy at night. That was the downside."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and sat at the bar both times. I'm a fan of their sister restaurant Grassroots and can say that Twisted Grove is on par with them. I've had the spinach salad both times and really enjoy the option to add an egg, it makes for a nice hearty filling salad. I also really enjoyed their french onion soup, it had really flavorful broth and perfectly caramelized onions. My husband has ordered the cavatelli which was a fancified mac & cheese with a sunny side up egg and it was fantastic. Service has always been great and attentive. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's a good place But Its not mind blowing either. It's a bit on a pricier side but it's Scottsdale so go figure! Went here for happy hour and in two hours, few drinks and two appetizers came to $100, certainly not your cheap happy hour spot that's for sure :)

The service is always attentive and I really like the ambiance, the rustic decor. They have tvs playing assorted sports which is cool. The crowd is the typical Scottsdale folks so you can make your own assumptions ;)

The drinks are well made. Appetizers are ok - the salmon poke and Brussel sprouts were good, although the sprouts were a bit too big. I had been there before on lunch time and had a procciuto flatbread, and that was exceptionally good. I think they have two different menus because I didn't see the flatbreads when I went there for the evening.

It's a cool spot for a casual weeknight date and I'd go back."}
{"text":"Visited the area last week, stayed at the Hyatt down the block.  Ended up eating here three straight nights it was so good.  The food and drinks are reasonably priced, the service is exceptional, and everything tastes incredible.  I literally ordered the gnocci/short ribs dish every night because it was so delicious.  The food was consistent and they put up with my 2 year old daughter jumping around in the booth and throwing sugar packets all over the place.  Wish this place had a sister restaurant in the DC area.  I'd be there all the time."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Small, cute, casual atmosphere with delicious food. A little pricier than your typical, casual place (my salad was $19 and entrees were $25-$35), but I thought it was worth it. Definitely have to try the bruschetta! The Bloody Mary and mimosa bar was awesome."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner, service and ambiance!!  Had the mushroom pasta and it was so fresh and light, wonderful.  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Great dinner!  Kids were happy with their meals (filet and chicken strips). The Brussels sprouts were amazing and I had the salmon + wonder salad. Great service and patio."}
{"text":"Really good, very pleased with the experience. A little loud when we walked in there and got seated but either I got used to it or it tuned down. Ordered the bruschetta although I would love to try the brussel sprouts (they are fried per our waiter), husband doesn't do Brussel sprouts or oysters. The avocado one was delightful (lol on my choice of words), marscapone was heaven and so was the tomato jam and arugula one. Even the green vegetable hating husband thought so. We split the short ribs and gnocchi (honestly a little small to split) but so so so so good, the ribs tender, the gnocchi so good. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We 'happened' onto this restaurant last night and we're very pleasantly surprised! The food was outstanding, as well as the wait staff and management! Would very highly recommend- we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and fabulous owners who care about the customers. Desert was simple but fabulous."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my wife for a date before we went to Top Golf. We sat outside and it was nice ambiance. Everything we had there was delicious. My wife ate the Cob Salad and she really enjoyed it. I got the Gnocchi and Short Ribs and it was presented beautifully and it tasted delicious.  We split the pecan pie which is totally different than any other pecan pie we have ever had. It has a custard like filling. It was really good. 

My only knock is that our waitress was not attentive to us. We had to ask another waitress to refill my wife's ice tea and at the end of our meal we had to ask another waitress to put in our order for dessert. Our assigned waitress never came by and asked us if we need anything. It was rather odd."}
{"text":"Been before and decided to take a friend for her birthday. Food was good and waitress was good too. Fun little place with some unique food ideas. Wish they did alittle SOMETHING for my friends birthday, would have made my choice to eat their that much more memorable. It's a nice touch and ALL places should do that."}
{"text":"Ya gotta try the twisted oysters! Off the Hook!
And I typically like my oysters raw. Fantastically prepared and exquisite flavors. Their a must! 
And some of the best crab cakes in the Valley. Real deal... not a bunch of bread fillers! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Happy Hour 7 days a week. Prime rib sliders, spinach dip, and fish tacos were exceptional. Atmosphere is beautiful. Drinks are clever. Paid $30 for dinner and drinks for two. Very pleased. I would have given it 5 stars if our server had been a bit more experienced. She was very sweet though. I ordered 2 raw oysters but sent them back because they were too small. They were $2.50 a piece. So I guess they were worth the price. We got a gift certificate for a free scoop of ice cream at the store down the block. Every table got this. I think it was called Sweet P's? Great ice cream. What a nice touch to end the meal."}
{"text":"If I lived closer to this area I would go here 3 or so times a week. It has a very casual atmosphere, but don't be fooled as their food is far from simple. 

 I originally heard about this place through a friend. All their dishes are well thought out, but their gnocchi short rib is probably their strongest dishes. In fact, it's the best dish I've had in a very long time.  

We had their tagalog for dessert. It was great, probably not my favorite but I would like to explore their other dessert dishes."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Twisted Grove several times. I have to explore new dishes but I just love their Cobb Salad, Crab Cakes and Brussel sprouts. Also love the roomy setting. You are not sitting on top of one another."}
{"text":"After TWO lunches just this week at Twisted Grove, I feel  like I can honestly say this is one of my new favorite places!  The service if fantastic and the food is creative, fresh, HOT and tastes amazing.  I had the cavatelli carbonera both times (yes, it is THAT good - and be sure to get the egg on top) and it was excellent both times.  Others at both lunches were very impressed and commented on the quality of the food.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN, MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT!  I have tasted their fish, chicken, twisted noodle salad, short ribs, carbonara (ask for an egg on top and grilled cheese sandwich on the side), bruschetta, Brussels sprouts... The list goes on! What I learned, early on, is that every meal MUST end with the most amazing dessert that you have ever tasted--their version of Tres Leches! Save room! 

The service has always been great and the environment is fun and hip! You can never go wrong with this restaurant! It will soon become your favorite, too!"}
{"text":"The best poke in town so far! Great atmosphere, friendly waiters and delicious food makes this place my new favorite."}
{"text":"We eat out quite often, so we get somewhat spoiled with all the great restaurants in Phoenix. So it was quite a surprise to stumble onto such an amazing place! The Decour is awesome, and the food is absolutely amazing. It is simple, fresh and absolutely more than you will ever expect. Price was extremely reasonable as well. You must check this place out!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great dining experience. We told the waiter first time in the restaurant as we just came in from Ct. Next thing we know the manager brought out a complimentary order of Brussels sprouts which were so good. Nice happy hour specials such as $4 drafts and reduced prices on apps. Had fish tacos which were tremendous and one of the best shells I ever had! Shishito Peppers with toasted coconut, Carmel and sea salt which sounds like an odd combo of flavors but really worked well. Had the crab cakes which seemed to be 100% crab and extremely fresh. Service was phenomenal with Chris as our attentive and pleasant waiter and Joseph the manager checking with us often. Only regret is they are not in CT"}
{"text":"OMG!!! My favorite New Place.. Love the atmosphere,  love the menu, I will be back to try other dishes..Very good quality food.. So happy with everything me and my husband ordered ."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great for happy hour. We had the grilled cheese board and bruschetta: mascarpone and prosciutto, burrata, and ricotta and bacon. The bruschetta blows Postino out of the water. The service with Maria was amazing. Check this place out, it seems like an underrated amazing little find. If we lived in this area we would come more often."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to the restaurant so many times they should dedicate a booth to us! The food and service are beyond reproach! The crab cakes and light and full of crab, no fillers. The soba noodle salad is SO GOOD -try it with steak. The coleslaw- walk away good! Don't forget to start with the brussel sprouts! Lastly, the chocolate chip cookies with sea salt and chocolate milk. This is not your mothers chocolate chip cookies- they are on steroids!!! We got some for Christmas dinner- YUP JUST THAT GOOD!!! Twisted Grove has nailed a great dining experience...OH SHOOT,  the drink menu is crazy good too!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way home from work during theirTwisted Hour (Happy Hour).  While there were plenty of patrons I was able to find a seat at the bar shortly after 5PM and there were still options to sit at the community table.  Attentive staff, lively crowd, with number on a first name basis with the servers.  To hold me over until dinner plans later this evening I ordered a prime rib slider which is well described on the menu, to that I'll comment that the a jus had a little something extra that added a nice flavor profile that I could not determine what it could be.  The one aspect that didn't fit was the sweetness of the brioche bun which for me distracted from the prime rib and a jus which complemented each other."}
{"text":"The restaurant had fallen off my radar screen. Fortunately our friends suggested a Saturday lunch here. This is really a pleasant venue; large enough to be spread out   It is somewhat a great room so the noise level can grow when it gets busy.  As noted in my picture I had a Cobb salad - actually our group ordered four of them. Tom had a roast beef sandwich that looked fabulous   Good time with good food ably delivered by Samantha, a lovely young waitress who is attentive to her customers. 

Reliably good food; great place for a business meeting."}
{"text":"Inviting ambience and location. Could tell that the parking situation, even when really busy, isn't an issue since there's an underground garage nearby. For our meal, I had the carbonara. The bacon in it was amazing, but after a while my palate became overwhelmed by too much salt. The tres leches cake for dessert was pretty good. There were some parts that were dry and needed more milk pour. I'd definitely return to try more things and to enjoy the environment."}
{"text":"This was amazing!! My BF and I shared the brussel sprouts that are so  highly recommended on yelp. They where just as good as we hoped. I had the gnocchi with short ribs. Some of the best food I've ever had. The gnocchi seemed to be lightly pan toasted which was awesome and the sauce didn't feel overly heavy. Only area of improvement would be that the food was slightly too salty - but that's personal preference."}
{"text":"Have been twice in two days, once with kids (great kid menu...). So excited to have another phenomenal restaurant in the neighborhood....!  Thank you..."}
{"text":"We love this place! Trust me, you have to come even if it's just to try the Twisted Oysters. I grew up on the East Coast, so I know good seafood, and these oysters are something I order every time. They're broiled with just a little bit spinach and artichoke dip on top that really adds to the flavor and doesn't over power it. The service has always been top notch and the tables are laid out not too close to each other. If you're going on a weekend make a reservation because they can be packed at times."}
{"text":"I had a business lunch here back in August and really enjoyed the experience.  The restaurant is bright, airy and lively.  The service is attentive and helpful.  The food is really quite tasty too.  I enjoyed a caesar salad with grilled cheese...love that option that you really don't see anywhere to add on a grilled cheese vs. salmon, chicken or steak.  The menu was quite different from what I remembered of the other location in Scottsdale, but still many tasty options to choose from.  Great, convenient location that will be a good meeting point for future business lunches."}
{"text":"This review is for a visit on Monday, January 16:

This was our first happy hour at Twisted Grove. We arrived at about 5 PM and were able to order enough food and drinks to satisfy us for lunch and dinner - we had skipped lunch!

The server Chelsea, was very pleasant and accommodating. When I ordered the Boulevard, I believe it was called, which is the closest thing to a Manhattan I asked if I could have a Luxardo cherry instead of a regular one and she said no problem. The drink came out a little too frothy for my liking but it tasted great.

For food we ordered the roasted brussels sprouts - the must-have and everyone knows how good they are...yes, they really are that good. We also had one prime rib slider each (very tender and flavorful prime rib, with just a little too much horseradish on the soft and buttery brioche bun.)

The caramelized onion and sausage pizza was shockingly a white flatbread with no tomato sauce and quite a nice surprise at that. The flatbread had a very puffy and light dough above the crispy surface and the nicely browned caramelized onions were sweet and flavorful, it also had crispy fried onions much like the kind on green bean casseroles! The sausage was nearly nonexistent maybe for the eight slices we had eight small pieces. We also shared the picnic chicken which was the least interesting of all but still very tasty with the tender crust, slightly spicy sauce and moist chicken meat. The sauce, angry bird sauce on the tables is absolutely fantastic. It is smoked Fresno chilies ground up with brown sugar vinegar and probably a little salt and pepper. It is a perfect balance of hot and flavor with only a touch of smoke, nothing like chipotle which is overbearing in the smoke department.

There are so many items on the menu we want to try that we will happily return for more happy hours!


The review below is for February 2016:
It was not crowded on a Sunday night. This was our first visit and we liked the appearance of the communal tables in the large open bar area.

One of us had several of the side dishes as an entrée - the broccolini and the cauliflower grits. Both are very tasty. The Asian noodle salad and a slightly spicy dressing and was very refreshing. The crab cake salad was awfully small for $17 - one crabcake and a small pile of greens. Not a good value whatsoever. 

The whole place has a very pleasant vibe and we look forward to returning and trying additional dishes."}
{"text":"First time there! Delicious food/drinks and their presentations were spot on. Plenty of options and price points. The service was excellent, our water glasses never went below halfway. Waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable. We had the Red Snapper Special and the Gnocchi with Short Ribs. Both were amazing! I would definitely recommend this place for a nice occasion: birthdays, anniversaries or a girl's night out!"}
{"text":"Super fun place!  Best salad I have ever had.  Order the Twisted Noodle Salad you will be so happy you did!"}
{"text":"Twisted Grove is a new American restaurant with a truly well curated atmosphere. The food is the star of the show, though. If you're looking to spend $20 on lunch, Twisted Grove is at the top of my list in Scottsdale. But it's hard to ignore the heavy wood entry doors, the community library inside the entryway, and that anything that can be put in a glass jar is certainly in a glass jar. 
 
Unless it's the Brussels sprouts, which were artfully spilled onto a board. The sprouts were crispy and not greasy. The pepper-glazed goat cheese was absolutely sinful. I took one bite and realized what gluttony truly meant. I felt like a king. The wild mushroom pappardelle was phenomenal: light, savory, and rewarding. I found myself thinking like the first grader that wants to eat his M&M's at a proportional rate, but then stuffs his face with M&M's because chocolate is sinfully addictive. Here's a bit of arugula, and now a mushroom, oh how about some pasta... and before you know it, all control is lost and I'm inhaling the rest.
 
My colleague asked me why I was writing down the music that was playing. I explained knowing Twisted Grove played Mr. Brightside, Spoon, Hang Me Out to Dry, but also Christmas music was useful for folks trying to understand the vibe. She told me that knowing they had a private dining room for group seating would be helpful. So if you're wondering, yes, they play alt rock and holiday music during the holidays, and they do have a room in the back.
 
Our server was cool. She knew we were in a rush, and her execution was as flawless as it was fun. If everyone visibly exuded optimism and cheerfulness like she did, I think we'd all live in a more pleasant world.
 
I would certainly come back. I actually took a chicken sandwich from Twisted Grove to my manager, who exclaimed that it was the best chicken sandwich he'd had in months. I hate that this restaurant with its quality and pricing is in the fru fru part of Scottsdale, but the food was fantastic and the atmosphere was inviting."}
{"text":"The happy hour menu is pretty awesome.  We had a few oysters  (2 for 3 bucks) is officially the cheapest in town now that I know of.  Hopefully they'll get better w the shucking,there were bits of shell in most of them.  I really enjoyed the grilled cheese platter w the tomato jam.  The fish tacos were solid though I would've appreciated some hot sauce or pickled jalapeños w it.  We also got the cookies and chocolate milk.  The cookies were good but I never understood the chocolate milk thing, it makes them not taste as sweet.  Plus it wasn't icy cold.  

All in all though, great beer selection and pretty decent happy hour.  I'd definitely go back and try some of their entrees!"}
{"text":"Food made both my boyfriend and I sick we called the next day, and the manager was so rude, she basically flat said your lying and not to back if we had a problem with the food and how it sat with us."}
{"text":"After a long week of work the hubs and I decided we needed something delicious in our bellies that didn't require us to cook after a long week of unpacking and work....soooo we came here!! 

We had a 40 minute wait for a table and it was worth every minute. The staff was pleasant, the bartenders looked like they had some good banter going on with their patrons and oh the feeling and ambiance of this restaurant is so enthralling, timeless and so so welcoming. 

The hubs and I decided to get a few small plates {**ORDER THE BRUSSLE SPROUTS**} and one entree to share...oh and wine and an old fashioned. 

You guys...it was all so delicious, the flavors paired so nicely between the three plates we ordered ... And then the dessert!!! Ah just go and have an amazing meal at an amazing restaurant and just know you will leave extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great service and great food! The roasted Brussels sprouts are a must! Our party of 8 each had something different and no one was disappointed! From the crab cakes, short rib gnocchi, roasted chicken, pasta dishes, and salads, you really can't go wrong. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Dine with caution ... first off our table was not ready at the requested time after a month in advance reservation. Once seated they seated us in a 6 person table for 8 people. We sat down and ordered drinks in which they served 1/2 of our group who ordered before the others. A couple of us ordered double dirty martinis and there was no issues until we changed our mind and decided a bottle of wine sounded better. However a bottle of wine apparently has more of an alcohol content than two double dirty martinis.... jokes all around because it does not!  Once they wouldn't serve us the bottle of wine I asked for the manager in which it took him over 20 minutes to come to our table. Only after I continued to demand him coming over did he arrive to tell us we would not be served due to someone being \"drunk\" at the table. I have no problem having a restaurant cut off one person at a table however please do not cut off those of us who are sober and then tell a very rationally speaking person they are hostile. We were a group of 8 professionals sitting at a table for a nice dinner I can assure you no one was drunk. However the best part is 8 people all ordering apps, full meals, drinks and bottles of wine are apparently not good enough for this restaurant. I have to say I have never been kicked out , denied or discriminated against in a restaurant nor have I ever acted in a way that has justified such. However the manager at this restaurant does not stop here..... we went next store to grab dinner now 8 pm. This restaurant surprisingly offered us a 10 minute wait time for a table then came back and said oh it will be 1 hour. However when we said no problem we will grab a drink at the bar we got the real story and the manager from the previous restaurant had called to inform them we should not be served due to our group challenging him. Grassroots then proceeded to inform us they wouldn't serve us. Again I have never been treated like this nor do I feel like we ever should have.... moral of the story this company and its sister restaurant have no interest in making money, being in a business of hospitality, or treating customers with one ounce of respect. Again dine with caution!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review from a good one to a bad one. I was very disappointed in the service I received tonight. I come to this place all the time and always get great service. This was the second year I decided to have my birthday dinner here and we made reservations 5 days prior through open table requesting a booth.

We walk in and the hostess was short with us. We told her we had a reservation and it was for a booth. The hostess told one of the other girls to seat us in the very first booth, well I had asked before we got seated if we could have a booth a few tables down because I didn't want to sit right by the door and we made these reservations in advance so I assumed they would reserve a nice table for us. The hostess was mad that we asked and even rolled her eyes as she sat us at the new table. 

Our server Heidi, seemed annoyed we were there. First off she took to long to greet us and second when she did get there we weren't sure what we wanted to drink and instead of giving us recommendations she just said she would be back. While we ordered food I asked for a substitution of goat cheese for my salad and she made it seem like it wasn't doable. She just seemed so annoyed we were there and wasn't very warm. When the food I came I got my order the way I wanted and it was great! But then she never came around to refill our waters. 

When they brought out the dessert they didn't bring us any utensils my boyfriend and to find two of them on the ledge by where we were sitting. So the four of us had to share two forks for the dessert. Heidi never asked us if we wanted separate tabs and brought one check. When we told her we needed two separate checks she looked confused and wanted us to split it down the middle. You can clearly see it's two couples dinning together, like why wouldn't you ask from the get go? Well she messed up the separate tabs regardless and only gave one couple their itemized receipt. We had to ask for the other one and she was so rude about it. 

I feel like she thought we looked young and we weren't gonna tip so she decided to give us poor service. Well that reflected in her tip. I'm also disappointed a manager wasn't making rounds at the tables to see how everyone was doing. I would've addressed all of this with him. I've been working in the food industry for years so I know how things go. The server and the hostess were so snobby and acted like we inconvenienced them. 

I'm truly dissatisfied and disappointed that I chose this place for my birthday and probably won't recommend them any time soon."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the restaurant, the staff and the food. I found this place by chance after doing a Yelp search for restaurants that took reservations (Friday night and a babysitter, I wasn't going to waste my night waiting for a table to clear up at a restaurant). I've been by this place several times a week since it opened and never noticed it.  Since I had the opportunity for an all too rare date night with the hubs, I did a quick check of the menu and called the restaurant for a reservation.

We arrived a little early for our 7:30 reservation figuring we would have to wait, but we were surprised to be led right to our table.  We had about a 5 minute wait before we could order our drinks, but both our waitress and the bartender stopped by the table to let us know they would be right with us. It was refreshing!

I tried their Blueberry Smash and their White Cosmo, my hubs had the iced tea.  The smash was delish! Crisp and slightly sweet. The Cosmo probably would have been better if I hadn't had the smash first. It tasted a bit more tart than I think I was ready for after rum and fruit, but that was my fault.  It was very good, but I probably shouldn't have mixed flavors.

We ordered the Pepper Glazed Goat Cheese for an appetizer. I loved the bubbly goat cheese, but I wasn't a fan of the peppadew relish. It was too sweet for my taste, but I can see how the sharp of the goat cheese and the sweet of the relish would be wonderful for someone that likes that. My husband loved it.  

While we were waiting for the appetizer, the hostess brought us complimentary roasted Brussels sprouts. Someone had ordered them and changed their mind and they didn't want them to go to waste. I had been talking about ordering them on the ride over, but since my hubs is not a fan of the sprouts we opted to look at another option. So this was a win-win for me. They were crispy, and so full of flavor.  I ended up dipping a few in the goat cheese (sans relish) and it was a little slice of heaven. There are big chunks of bacon and roasted garlic throughout and they were like little treasures to be found.

The hubs ordered the Gnocchi & Short Ribs. They were cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and the rib meat was so tender it almost melted under the weight of the fork. He is already asking when we get to go back.

I had the crab cakes. They were seasoned well, but I wish there had been a smidgen more of the aioli. I was using it on both the crab cakes and the parm fries the dish comes with. YUM! The dish also comes with cole slaw, something I was not planning on liking as it is usually overdressed, mayonaisey or sweet. This one was perfect. Very lightly dressed, it had a nice tang and the cabbage was very crunchy and cold. 

We also tried the Tres Leche cake on recommendation of both the hostess and our waitress. It was sinful. The salted caramel, which I'm usually not a big fan of, was perfect with the cool whipped cream and the hot cake. It was a balanced flavor sensation. Every tastebud had something to be excited about.

I would highly recommend this place. I would also recommend making a reservation if you are going to go on a Friday night. The place was packed, the bar was packed, and there was a couple who left the waiting area because there was a wait. 

There is a patio I can't wait to sit on during a crisp fall evening, the bar has several TV's with sports (hubs was happy), and they have 2 private dining rooms for events.

I'm looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Oysters. Fish tacos. Honest drinks -- an actual classic Sazerac. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"If they had 6, i would give it.  Wow on crab cakes, gnocchi, short rib, sliders and tres leches.   Service was super great!  This will b a regular visit anytime we r in scottsdale."}
{"text":"Yes! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is friendly and inviting. Reservations are a must if you plan to go on a weekend night The brussels sprouts appetizer and the twisted noodle salad are both a must! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the charred brussels sprouts and bruschetta board. The Scottish salmon entree and the prime rib are also delicious. Enjoy the atmosphere and fire pit of this newer restaurant in scottsdale. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow - I really love this new place!  We stopped in yesterday during brunch and had a great experience.  We snagged a corner table on the pet friendly patio and had a great \"family\" lunch.  I enjoyed a strawberry bellini - man, I could drink way too many of these amazing concoctions!  For our main meal, my hubby thoroughly enjoyed his carbonara and I thoroughly enjoyed my side sampler of cauliflower grits, spaghetti squash, broccolini, and creamed spinach...absolutely perfect!  Great atmosphere inside and out, great food and great service too!"}
{"text":"Not from this area but a great Resteraunt and fun atmosphere.  A little pricey but a great night out"}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks and service. Insane happy hour!!!Excellent kids menu options and kids eat free during certain hours. We had the Brussels sprouts app, short rib gnocchi, and crab cakes. The fleur de lis drink was wonderful. Butterscotch pecan pie for dessert was divine. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Update and request to the manager of this fine restaurant:  Please increase the type size on the menu because it is nearly impossible to see in the dim light of the restaurant.  It was quite frustrating."}
{"text":"I like hanging out in my old hood of Arcadia/Camelback from time to time. When I saw that a new place had opened on the corner of all things good, I had to see for myself. Twisted Grove Parlor + Bar impressed me upon entering. The vibe is nice and more on an upscale mode. We opted to sit at the bar, as we didn't want a full meal. The bartender was completely attentive and very informative on drinks. I decided I was a tad hungry but not wanting a full meal. They have a full dinner menu until 2100 and then it goes to a late night menu which is more apps and flatbreads. It was so nice that because we were on the fence about what to order our bartender let us know it was gonna change soon and offered both menus to help us decide. 
What we ordered :
Shishito Peppers: These aren't like any shishito peppers you have ever had! Grilled to a blister with sea salt and served with warm caramel and coconut. Peppery and sweet! I highly recommend!

New School Spinach Dip: Tasty , warm, garlicky fresh creamy artichoke and spinach dip served with fresh pico de gallo and tortilla chips topped with small red peppers. This is so sinful but good! In a perfect world where no one gets fat from food like this .. I would have gorged on this!!

Common Ground Burrata: Because I wanted this and my husband did not and I truly wasn't into getting three items so late.. The bartender insisted on comp'ing us this! I really didn't want her to! TOO much food! BUT, low and behold it showed up and that was beyond sweet of her ! I did NOT love this, however. The tomatoes were yellow and orange and firm. Initially they arrived with no olive oil and no salt and pepper on them and she noticed and sent them back! Would I order again? Probably not. Just wasn't my favorite thing..

The wine and beer list here at Twisted Grove Parlor + Bar is good! My husband likes Abita and they have it! I love sparkling wines and it's here too! Their cocktails are also on point! 
This is a great place to hang with good food and shareables! 
Twisted Hour is daily from 3-6pm with drink specials and $4 craft brews. Oh, and oysters too; OH and it's a brunch place to add to my list ! I definitely will be back because I love the area and a great place with great service!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! 
Parmesan French Fries were out-of-this-world!
Bruscetta platter was huge.
Fish tacos were delightful.
Wish this was closer.  Nice place."}
{"text":"Love this place. It was around 4:30pm. It was beautiful outside and they had a nice patio but we sat inside. The server was quick and polite and the happy hour food and drink menu was great! My kids each had kids meals, one had pasta with marinara, the other had mac and cheese. Both came with very tasty battered fries and broccolini! My husband and I tried the prime rib slider, the fish tacos and the grilled cheese. They were all awesome. Each table has a bottle of house made hot sauce on it. We ended up buying a bottle it was so good. We did get the tres Leches cake for dessert. Very pretty and tasty. All good things :)"}
{"text":"Excellent! After two failed restaurants it is so good to see this one got it right! The change in architecture and size helps immensely. Very cool new look.
Menu great and the food for all four of us was exceptional! Gnocchi and short ribs, steak frittes, artichokes.  All yummy.
I would expand on their wine list a little fort wine by the glass but their sweet and spicy margarita was killer!
Our waiter Joseph was funny, attentive and knowledgeable on the menu. Kudos."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time to Scottsdale and needed just a little bite to hold me over till dinner.  The food was pretty good, the prices were average, however the bartender Matthew was excellent.  I explained what I liked to drink and he worked up a lovely cool refreshing adult beverage.  Matthew was also great about what worked and what was not the best for my tastes.  Overall this was nice stop."}
{"text":"I am writing this strictly for their crab cakes. Our office came here for our \"after holiday\" party. We had this lovely closed room all to ourselves and got to try many items on the menu. However, the one that stood out were the crab cakes. Being from the east coast, I Know what real crab cakes should taste and look like. These were the best I have seen and tasted. They had a nice,even browned outer layer that wasn't to breaded, so you could taste the wonderful crab mixture inside. They weren't stuck together by breading and mayonnaise, but rather flaked easily because they were all crab with just the right amount of seasoning to make them delicious.

If you have been searching for the perfect crab cake, this is the place!"}
{"text":"We really like this place ! They really pay attention to hiring staff that's provides great customer service . We have tried many things on the menu but the flat bread with borson cheese and mushrooms and the bruschettas stand out the most ! The only reason I'm  giving 4 stars is because one experience there ( on my husbands birthday ) was not pleasant . They brought us out sides and never brought us our  entrees and server took a long time to acknowledge anything . But  it was also super busy and it was a very new resteraunt , and they were vey apologetic and made up for it . Other than that it's a great place to go for some good apps and has good environment !"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are always great, with a good selection and variety. The bartenders give really attentive service.  Recommend the short rib gnocchi, caeser salad or bruschetta"}
{"text":"Big 5 for this one. Absolutely great. Why have I not been here before to this little gem. Totally up my alley in terms of food, ambiance, and atmosphere.

Came here for lunch for the first time and I will be back for sure. They had a totally cool front door entrance. And very welcoming inside. The hostess was right there smiling and it started off very well from there. 

We got seated promptly in a long nice comfy booth and cool table. We had a bunch of items.

First we had the Brussel sprouts with bacon and a balsamic glaze. Wowoweeee. This was good. Loved the crispy bacon and glaze. The presentation was awesome as well. Check the pic I posted. Then we had the spinach dip. Nachos came with a crema sauce and peppers to add to the flavor. The spinach was hot and also in a cool display not just a normal jar. I like that. 

For the main entrees my buddy got the gnocchi with braised short rib and I got the twisted noodle salad with steak and extra dressing. I tried some of the gnocchi and it was so good. The salad was perfect. Not too heavy and filled me up and didn't feel bad after. Great flavor, steak was done perfectly.

Our server Teghan was super friendly and nice. Very prompt with follow up and checked on us multiple times. She got it. 

Overall great and well deserved 5 all the way from me. I will be back."}
{"text":"I was super pleased with this place. 
I loved Zen 32.  I loved Central Bistro.  And now I love Twisted Grove.  I thought that the Brussel sprouts, carbonara and short rib gnocchi were on point."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients. Bright and inviting dining room. Well educated server. Dishes were rich and flavorful but uncomplicated. I had the wild mushroom pappardelle and it was amazing! Very chill atmosphere. Also loved the 4 side option. The grilled cauliflower with tahini sauce was a great combo."}
{"text":"If your at a snails pace, this is the place to go. Friendly staff, but seem to be a bit off their game. I asked two different servers for lemon for my water and a straw. I never got the lemon, and the straw was brought with bare hands and placed in my glass for me. How nice is that?  Our server put our food order in before taking our drink order. Better late than never. If you like bubbly that tastes like bad beer, by all means order the sparkling wine. Our check was wrong as we were charged for the wrong items. 

On a positive note, the crispy grouper with coleslaw is delicious as was the spaghetti squash and French onion soup. Second time here and if we come back, it will be at a snails pace."}
{"text":"Food and service is amazing. 10/10 recommend! Great place for family, friends or even a date night. Charming patios and amazing ambiance! I recommend everything on the menu, however the short ribs and gnocchi has to be my favorite item."}
{"text":"Wow, food and service both outstanding. So happy to have a new choice in the hood. Such a bummer that you have to write a certain amount of words, when one sentence says it all."}
{"text":"I've had prepared brussels sprouts all over the United States and Europe. This preparation ranks amongst the very best. I also loved their gnocchi and short rib."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time about a week ago, and it was pretty good! I would say I think it's kind of overpriced, though. 

For drinks, we felt like ~treating ourselves~ to some of their \"fine cocktails\". I had the Strawberry Bellini and my boyfriend tried the Sazerac. The Bellini was okay, nothing special. Strawberries aren't really in season right now, and you could tell by the taste of the purée in the drink; it was kind of sour. But at least then you know it's fresh fruit lol. They also had a bartender-in-training that night, who accidentally made my boyfriend's a double so we weren't complaining about that :) 

For the appetizer we tried the Bruschetta Board with the mascarpone, prosciutto and sweet pepper relish, the ricotta, candied bacon and crispy onion salad, and the burrata, jammin' spicy tomato, arugula and sea salt. All were yummy, but not the best bruschetta I've ever had. The ricotta with bacon and onions was definitely our favorite. The one with sea salt was a little too salty for my taste. 

Then, for dinner, I had the Cavatelli Carbonara, which I really enjoyed. I like that they add brussels sprouts, which isn't something I normally get in pasta. A little saucy, but very good! I really enjoyed the leftovers. My boyfriend got the Grassroots Caesar Salad with chicken, which was also very good (I kind of wished I ordered that!). The croutons were humongous, lol I took some snapchats but wish I saved a photo. I did think at $16 it was a bit expensive for a Caesar salad, but that's okay. Overall, this place was quite good! :)"}
{"text":"Never thought that head chef and owner Chris Collins could have topped his Grassroots restaurant's menus but he did it... Amazing take on new American cuisine this place is definitely worth checking out and not only for the amazing vibe! I'd highly suggest starting with one of their homemade shandys or cocktails then either the brussel sprout or artichoke apps. We had the lamb chops and chicken carbonara (pasta's all made in house btw) and they were to die for... Don't miss the chance to try out this cool new spot!"}
{"text":"This is one of the newest restaurants that you must try in Scottsdale. The food is beyond delicious and the ambiance is lively. I went with a group of friends, and the reservation process was easy through Open Table. When I arrived they had my table ready, and we were quickly seated. I'm glad I made reservations because it was very busy for a Thursday. 
 
I had to go with the most ordered plate, Gnocchi and Short Rib, which is beyond delicious; all my friends wished they got it themselves. Another crowd favorite was the prime rib, which they mentioned was cooked to perfection.

I will definitely be back for another round of dishes. Also, before I forget, the service was excellent, and they provided us with a free round of oysters due to mix up on our order."}
{"text":"Made reservations on Open Table for my daughter's 19th birthday - they only had tables available on the patio (was a little worried about it being too cold but that is where she wanted to go so we went for it).  We arrived, the restaurant wasn't terribly crowded - they put the 3 of us at a round table for 6 which was a little awkward.  We weren't offered any other options (inside or otherwise).  When our waiter arrived, she told us about the specials and we ordered an appetizer (which she offered to comp since we were first timers), a lemonade and 2 glasses of wine.  Water was brought out for 2 of us, so we asked for another and never received it.  The appetizer came out after a decent wait - still no wine.  We were nearly finished with the appetizer when the waiter came back to ask us if we were ready to order.  We pointed out that we were still waiting for our wine - she seemed confused and went away to see about that.  Another wait.....then we ordered and THEN our wine appeared.  My husband had finished his glass by the time the meal came - our dinners were dropped off without any ask on refills for anyone (daughter's lemonade was also empty and we still didn't have the 3rd water).  My daughter and I each had an entrée that was $32 - both were ok - definitely not exceptional.  I got the crab cakes which were very mayonnaise laden and came with coleslaw and French fries.  Was it worth $32 - definitely not.  My daughter had the prime rib and said it was good.  My husband had the gnocchi and short ribs which wasn't actually gnocchi but ricotta \"puffs\" which were good but not gnocchi.  There was no mention of the birthday we noted on our reservation.  We had been there for quite some time by the time we finished our meal (still no offer of an additional glass of wine or anything) so we decided to cut our losses and take her out for ice cream on the way home.  So much for \"special occasion\" or \"birthday\" being noted.  I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"They have a very nice outdoor easting area.  Good food.  Good Service."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Twisted Grove.  Great presentation, and the amount of food is definitely healthy.  I thought the chicken flatbread was pretty amazing; really cheesy with a great spicy sauce served on top.  

We also shared the grouper sandwich which was pretty much a crispy Kentucky fried piece of really  fresh fish.  It also had the perfect light and airy brioche bun, and excellently crisped garlic fries.  Be sure to ask for a side of their house aioli for the fries and the sandwich to enhance the flavor.  The sandwich really benefits from the added sauce as it is simply topped with their house slaw.  Seriously one of the best fish sandwiches I've had in Scottsdale and this is one week out of enjoying fresh fried snapper in Nassau.    

IMO Atmosphere is best described as a hipster sports bar with craft cocktails and a healthy beer selection.  I could see this place filling up during the 6:30 - 8:00 dinner rush, but when we came around 9:00 the rush was done so it made for a really nicely paced meal.  I'll be back.  There's a lot more of the menu to explore.  They are definitely a welcomed addition to the growing Scottsdale food scene."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. First visit from Europe. Service excellent and simply brilliant experience"}
{"text":"Service was not good. We sat with menus in front of us for 10 minutes. I had to get up from the table to let the hostess know that no one had even greeted us. The Pacific Cove oysters were delicious."}
{"text":"While the parking was a little tricky, I thoroughly enjoyed this place. My book club met here, and they were accommadating for the medium sized group. I enjoyed the couple of appetizers that I ordered and my wine. There were things on the menu that I didn't have enough room to try, so I'll have to come back! I'd call this a gastropub - definitely some interesting and delicious choices!"}
{"text":"Last night, we came here around 8:00pm and We were seated right away, but the place was still busy. Based on the previous reviews, we had to try the Brussel sprouts; which were everything I had dreamt of. Their wine list was great and reasonably priced. My husband ordered the angry bird pizza and I had the sunny Cobb- both were delicious! I'd definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I've come to Twisted Grove now a few times: happy hour with the ladies, dinner with friends, a quick meal at the bar, and the food has always been consistently good. Service is somewhat slow, but that's easy to overlook with great company. The menu has something for everyone, and while there are some eclectic choices, picky eaters can do just fine here.

Dinner tonight was the salmon entree - cooked to perfect! The broccolini was slightly under cooked but the green goddess sauce over it was delicious. 

We always get the Brussels sprouts - these are some of the best in town! We always order them well-done. The bacon pieces in the mix are thick and hearty. So good! 

My boyfriend always gets the carbonara with an over easy egg - he's the picky eater, but this is one of his most favorite dishes! We definitely recommend this, and also the gnocchi with short rib. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Family friendly 100%! 
My children loved and food and even ate the broccoli!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service every time! Try the bruschetta, the arcadia club, the crab cakes, and of course the butterscotch pecan pie for dessert. Can get a bit crowded at dinner time...might want to visit during mid-afternoon on a weekday if you like a quieter atmosphere."}
{"text":"OK, I had one so so experience, I went back today and it was amazing and the service from Alex was not only excellent but lots of fun too!  I did brunch, Croque Madame, and it was beyond fabulous, with tender thin sliced ham, rich cheese and just a whisp of dijon."}
{"text":"Started out well, great meet, quick drink order, things are going good. Wife's wine is good, Sazerac is weak, thin, whatever. Ask for an app, and Against our better judgement we place entree orders because Taylor says, no worries, I will hold them until you are ready. Barely made it through the app and here is the entree.. Send them back and ask for a glass of wine and some time. Entree's show up before the wine.. At this point, Taylor knows that things have gone into the weeds and shuts down. Oh well, live and learn. There are a LOT of other restaurants in North Phoenix to try. Skip this one."}
{"text":"In my hood so tried it out.  Went in and ordered a beer first. Looked at the menu and the oysters seemed appealing to begin with; however wanted to make sure it was the ones I like, so asked which oysters they have; blue points?  Kumamotos?  BLANK STARE.... then a waitress came up that appeared to either be drunk or maybe a bit on a high...went and asked and she said \"from Mexico\".  Ok a bit skeptical of ordering food at this point.  Drank my beer, asked for the check and paid in cash.  When I did, the bartender kept my change.  Wow..... one more place in the space that all other restaurants closed down.  Bad experience bad service and what it looked like to be microwaveable food according to the guests around me.  Negative  rating, trust me you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice American looking restaurant with an airy patio. The menu is mostly American Comfort food. 

I had the crispy grouper sandwich with spaghetti squash as my side. The grouper seemed as fresh as can be and was so moist and mild it just melted in my mouth. I did find it impossible to eat as a sandwich because the bun is too large so I ate it open faced with half the bun. The house made slaw and pickles were very tasty and cut the richness of the buttery rich bun and fried fish. For me I thought the spaghetti squash was too rich with butter, cream and cheese but my husband thought it was very good. The sandwich did cost $14.00 but I thought that was a very fair price for grouper since grouper runs about $22.00 a pound.

My husband had the cavatelli carbonara with the $1.00 add on sunny egg. He thought it was excellent but thought it was a small portion and should have came with a little bread or a small salad or should have been just a little bigger.

Our waiter highly recommended the monkey bread for dessert and said it was his favorite. The pies at the sister restaurant Grass Roots are outstanding so I thought dessert from here would have to be too. Honestly the dessert was tasty and reminded me of sticky buns but it was a lot of bread and can feed 4-6 people.

Service was friendly and efficient.

{"text":"Awful experience, bad service, food was wrong, and not good"}
{"text":"Not impressed!
I know it's early and they still need to work out a few kinks.

We sat at the bar and it was fairly busy and was tough to get the bartenders attention which took about 10 minutes. Ordered our drinks, still waiting.....10 minutes later the bartender says \"what did you order again?\"
Oh brother, in for a long night!
Finally he brings us our cocktails, this is no mixologist and felt like this guy was just out of bartending school. At $9 each, the cocktails were pretty poor and not well prepared. Tasted like a college kid made them.

Food: order bruschetta which was quite good 4/5. Lots too from but were out of one that we wanted, yet what we did get was a B+.

Short ribs: while they were very good and served over pillowy gnocchi which was excellent, at $17 it literally was the size of a small appetizer. Had 3 very small pieces of short rib totaling no more than 3oz and only a few gnocchi. This was a joke. Even though was well prepared I would never order that again.

Salmon: very good, cooked a perfect medium again at $23 for a really small portion over a bit of kale salad. It's just too pricey for what you get.

Overall..go next door to Grassroots! It's better quality, service and priced accordingly. Hope Twisted makes the necessary adjustments and it will be successful. Not sure if I would come back at this point."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my husband and enjoyed everything!  We ordered the brussel sprouts, short rib gnocchi and the carbonara.  We enjoyed every bite!  The only bad thing is that I really wanted to take a nap after eating, but had to go back to work!"}
{"text":"Came during the lunch hour with a large group. We had originally stopped by Grassroots but with such a large party they were unable to seat us at the time. They suggested we try their sister restaurant - which led us to Twisted Grove. We were sat immediately and service was prompt. The entire staff was great as we had two waitresses and one or two serves for our party. 
I ordered the Twisted Noodle Salad - and it was to die for! Mangoes, cashews, and steak all in one salad? Yes please! It was SLIGHTLY over dressed - but I still can't complain as I ate every last piece. Others in my party ordered the salmon, grouper sandwich, Cobb salad, crab cake salad, and a flat bread and everyone raved about how good their dish was. 
I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"5 for food, 0 for customer service.  had a long lunch at about 1:30 PM.  my girlfriend and I enjoyed our plates and I ordered my husband his lunch when I ordered our meals.  when she brought our meals, she asked if I would like the carbonara made for my husband, I said yes I would've liked it if it was already made! she said oh so sorry didn't want to ruin it I'll put it in now.  Trev about 30 minutes home gave my husband the lunch and the only thing that was in the bag were my leftovers.  asked the manager on duty if he could please send it in an Uber eats or Postmates or something like that probably about five bucks.  he refused.  unfortunately it's going to be another great restaurant with great food that also can't last the corner.  expecting me to drive 50 more minutes to pick up something I had already paid for was very inconsiderate.  five dollar Uber eats definitely could've remedied the situation."}
{"text":"Food was ok. The gnocchi was not good. I had ordered it on a previous visit. I didn't like it. This time, Someone in my party ordered it and didn't like it. The meat tasted gamey. Wasted $20 on that. The Brussels sprouts were great."}
{"text":"I was here with my co-workers on Thursday. I was very impressed with the service. The food was delicious. I had the chicken BLT sandwich, and my co-workers had the eggplant stack, pizza and the club sandwich. All the dishes looked amazing and were delicious. The manager or chef came out and brought us each a sample of the pecan pie. It's was so good.. we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Welcoming! We decided to try this new place for my sisters birthday. The restaurant was very kind and accommodating, even to my 3yo nephew. They also offered us a free dessert! Everyone loves the Brussel sprouts but the prime rib was \"eh\". The sauce that goes w the artichokes was a scrumptious lemon hollandaise. The crab cakes were good but a little over mayonnaise-y. Everyone loves the tres leche cake. Food was probably 4/5 but overall, service was accommodating and welcoming. This made out experience 5out of 5!"}
{"text":"I drive by the Hayden location at least twice a day, but until last month had never stopped in for a meal. The first visit - we really enjoyed the food! 

So, for Father's Day, I ordered my husband's favorites (takeout) - grilled artichokes, roasted cauliflower and Brussel sprouts (MINUS bacon).  

When I called in the order, I specifically requested 'no bacon' and confirmed that none of the items were cooked in bacon grease or any other animal fat. My husband was thrilled when I got home...until we (both vegetarians for 20+ years) realized that the crispy, yummy Brussels in our mouths were accompanied by thick chunks of BACON! 

It wasn't the end of the world, so I called the restaurant and asked to be credited back for the brussel sprouts. The woman who answered - Maya - offered to make a new order. We were already home and eating dinner, so I again asked her to just credit me back for the order of brussels.  

To me, this seemed like a reasonable and logical solution...as i wasn't requesting a full refund, just a credit for the item that was wrong. However, she explained that it's against 'company policy' to refund customers for mistakes on to-go orders, and the only option is to pick up a replacement order. She then went on to say that this policy is the reason people should thoroughly check their order before leaving the restaurant. Wow, so now it's my fault that I didn't receive the correct order?!?!?!

I asked for a manager, and Maya stated that she was the manager, and repeated the \"company policy\" - and added that there are 'no exceptions.'  When I said how ridiculous this sounded, she replied, \"I'm not sure why you feel that way.\" At that point, I was DONE. DONE. AND DONE.

My husband was so annoyed that he jumped back in the car and \"returned\" the bacon-filled order of brussels. He told the manager that he intended on writing a review, to which she replied \"if that makes you feel better, you should.\" 

In short, I just discovered this restaurant and loved the food. I live nearby and would've been a long-time customer...but now have no plans to return."}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious! The staff is so wonderful!! They are professional, friendly and very knowledgeable!! The bar is amazing! Cocktails are so thirst quenching and they have a wonderful beer and wine selection! Joseph is the best bartender I have ever met, he always shows us a good time!!! I absolutely love this place, it is very beautiful and I always leave extremely happy."}
{"text":"What a great new place! The food is terrific, servers caring, great atmosphere. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is a very slow bar....if you plan on a drink with an appetizer and another with the meal, better order both up front....more timely service there would put it over the top!"}
{"text":"This place is one of our top favorites as a family! I like that the variety of food is enough for any one of our friends or family who are picky can find something on their menu! We love the appetizers! I love the grilled artichokes and my husband loves their brussel sprouts! Their sausage pizza is fantastic and my daughter loves it! I love their roasted chicken or the carbonara while my husband has tried most everything there and it has yet to disappoint! Their salads are also great and filling it's enough for two! I'm so glad to drive here from Mesa and meet family and friends from all over the valley here!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Service is terrific- warm & friendly. Food is excellent. Love the twisted noodle salad, the Brussels sprouts & the bruschetta is fantastic!"}
{"text":"WOW! We stopped here for lunch, I had family in town. What a find! The menu had so many mouthwatering choices I couldn't decide. We started with the Brussel sprouts. I do not like them but my family does. They ranted and raved how delicious they were, I admit I tried one. Not my cup of tea but A+ on presentation. On our waiters suggestion I ordered the gnocchi and short ribs. HOLY COW! Taste buds had a blast! Ribs were not on the bone (yeah!), tender, juicy and the gnocchi were pan fried with some crispness. Sauce was perfect and the portion was just right. We sat outside and the patio was large enough that we weren't on top of other tables. I'm DEFINITELY returning !!!! Can't go wrong here! Something for everyone! PS, our waiter Travis was AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Twisted noodle salad is the Best salad I've EVER had! The  Angry Bird flatbread was also delish! Quick and good service and their own cute sweet shop next door! LOVE everything about this place!"}
{"text":"I had been out all day showing homes and we decided to stop in for a quick meal. We actually ordered off the happy hour menu which has fabulous pricing and options. We ordered the caprese flatbread, the roast beef sandwich, Parmesan fries, some mashed potato dish that had bacon, cheese (AMAZING!), the spinach dip, and a few other items. Everything was so so yummy. I had a dirty martini on HH and it was perfect. We will be back. Only downside was our server seemed so shy and quiet."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, Great Prices!  I wish I had someplace like this by my house in LA.  Found this on Yelp not too far from my hotel.  The Brussel Sprouts got my attention and the Cauliflower Grits pulled me in the door.  The food did not disappoint.  Brussel sprouts were crispy goodness, Cauliflower was creamy goodness.  Also got the Cobb Salad and ended with the sweetened Ricotta/Cherry Compot/Buttermilk biscuit Crisp.  The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable.  And for all of this the price was VERY REASONABLE.  I'd highly recommend going.  They've only been open for about 3 or 4 months, but the food felt well thought out and very tasty.  if you are in the area make a trip here, I think you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since I was working in the area. I was craving pasta so I got  the carbonara and my co worker the chicken sandwich. I wish I switch because the pasta was just super doughy( cooked) and the cream sauce was overcooked as it was separating on the spot. To top it off, the Bacon was way to salty and it was just a mess as the egg on top was just too much and not needed if the sauce was that rich already. 
three bites and i was done,"}
{"text":"Yes the Brussels sprouts are amazing and so are the drinks and service and entrees. There were 8 in our party and it was a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food (especially brunch), easy location and great environment. I love this place - it's my new go-to hangout. Can't wait to try other locations."}
{"text":"AWESOME! Been three times damn great service great food. Just feels good, feels fun owner happened to be there - chatted with this for quite a while. Definitely be back"}
{"text":"Love their Scottsdale location and now they are right around the corner from me in Arcadia/Biltmore!  I've got to have those brussel sprouts to start and then....so many fabulous choices!  Their Burrata appetizer rocks too!"}
{"text":"Went there with a couple friends and sat in the patio since we rode our bikes. Great patio, terrible service. Ordered some drinks, waited a while then ordered some appetizers. Food came before our first drinks did. As we ate our food and were ready for refills on water and more drinks no one came by, even while other tables were being served. Finally we ordered more drinks from another waiter and it took another 20+ min to get them. We got them when we went inside and grabbed them from the bar tender since they were waiting on a serving tray. The nachos were pretty good and bruschetta was good. Drinks were okay...service was awful."}
{"text":"This place is simply outstanding!  We made reservations, but since we got there early and the hockey game was on, we decided to have a drink at the bar.  The bartenders were so friendly and we were having such a good time, we told the hostess we were going to just remain at the bar.  First, i tried a drink...was not a huge fan, but I would have drank it.  Bartender asked if I liked it, said honestly not really, she nstantly made me a different drink.  We started with Oysters...very good.  Then we ordered our main dishes.  I had the gnocchi and short ribs...holy cow it was wonderful!   My wife thought the same of her meal.  Throughout dinner the bartenders were very attentive, interacted the perfect amount, and were more responsive than most servers if we were at a table.  Both my wife and I agreed, it was such a pleasant discovery and we were disappointed we had not been there prior.  We will be back for sure.  Great place for food or just a cool place to have some drinks.  Everyone we chatted with at the bar were also super friendly.  Great area of town as well, and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"The best place I have found in the area for an amazing lunch.  Pricey, but the meal is worth every penny"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, good music! Loved my experience here with my brother on Saturday at the bar. Recommend the crab cakes!"}
{"text":"On February 1, 2018 we took 2 out of town guests to Twisted Grove on a weeknight.  We enjoyed our dinner for 3, which included the night's special - a delicious sea bass in cream sauce, the house roasted salmon, and a burger.  Unfortunately, the 2 diners who ordered the fish entrees were violently ill after midnight, and throughout the entire night.  We can only surmise that food poisoning was the cause.  I reached out to the restaurant the very next morning, spoke to a bartender and the day manager, with no concern or formal response."}
{"text":"Very disappointing is all I can say.  We've been to the Twisted Grove many times because we love their food and the atmosphere.  However, our most recent trip proved to be very different, almost as if we were in an episode of Bar Rescue.... before the rescue!  My family and I went for dinner on a Tuesday evening. After we placed our orders, it was approximately 20 minutes later when our waitress Emma came to inform us they were out of chicken. How can you be out of chicken on a Tuesday evening at 7:30PM especially when that is one of your staple ingredients for quite a few dishes on the menu?!  After trying to make another selection, it turned out they were also out of the main ingredient for another  dish.  At this time we asked to speak to the manager.  After 10 minutes one of the managers named Travis appeared at our table.  He was completely disheveled and his shirt was dirty/stained, which did not help the situation.  When we explained our frustration and inquired if running out of food was an occurrence that also happens at their other three restaurants, Travis was quick to respond with, \"it's actually 5 restaurants.\"  Really!?!  Seems to me Travis was completely missing the whole point and most concerning, was he didn't seem to even care.   Needless to say, we had guests with us and had spoken very highly about the Twisted Grove, so this was a very uncomfortable situation!  If we would have known they'd be out of food for some of their main dishes we would have gone elsewhere.  The only thing Travis did was correct the number of restaurants the group owns.  We were not looking for a free meal or anything like that, however we were looking for some acknowledgment or an apology, but at no point did Travis do or even say anything to attempt to rectify the issues at hand.  But wait there's more!  One of the dishes we ordered was the mushroom and Boursin cheese flatbread.  Every time we go, we order it and it's delicious.  When the flatbread was brought to the table we knew right away it was not made correctly because it looked very different and after tasting it, it tasted completely different.  Boursin cheese is a white crumbly cheese with garlic and various herbs in it.  The flatbread appeared to have only cheese on it which resembled Dofino cheese and it was paper thing, with no herbs to be seen and you certainly couldn't taste the garlic either.  In the past you could see the white colored Boursin cheese with its herbs on the top nicely melted, and you could taste it too! Not this time.  We called our waitress over and explained the situation.  Emma was very apologetic and sent the manager over.  Travis once again appeared and this time brought with him a little cup of cheese stating it was Boursin.  After looking at it and tasting it, yes it was Boursin, but that's not what was on the flatbread.  Travis then mentioned that the dish is actually made with Marscapone and 5 other types of cheese, not including the Boursin.  What - Really?!?!  That's the first time we'd ever heard about the dish having those other ingredients and it's not at all how it's written/described on the menu!  It was then very apparent that Travis was not only very unprofessional and uninformed, but judging from his behavior, and appearance, he just didn't care!  Needless to say we will not be recommending the Twisted Grove anytime soon.  The only positive from the evening's events was that our waitress Emma was very professional.  Maybe Travis should take some lessons from her and maybe the Twisted Grove should re-train their managers, including the teams in the kitchen and the chefs, to ensure they don't run out of food and that dishes are made correctly!"}
{"text":"Four stars and I have no interest in going back. I had the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes and it was good, nothing special. That's how I feel about Twisted Grove in general...nothing special.  I shouldn't say nothing, because the crispy brussels sprout appetizer was really good. I think the main reason for the negative tone is because I think their sister restaurant next door is special, which is Grassroots."}
{"text":"It's a neat looking restaurant with great food. The grilled artichoke is outstanding and they don't skimp on the bacon when you order the brussel sprouts. The flatbreads are great. One of those is perfect for 2 to share."}
{"text":"Couldn't have been more happy with our dinner. From the ease of making a reservation to the very sweet servers and hostess.. 
the food was excellent and I thought the prices were very fair. We had the Brussel Sprout appetizer and it was fantastic. We had a delicious pasta dish (I cannot recall the name, but it had a cream sauce and bacon and Brussels sprouts). We also had the gnocchi and short ribs. Wow. I wish I could eat like that every night. 
Not a complaint or criticism here!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, decor, service and menu. The prices were on par with the type of organic cuisine, that and being in Gainey Ranch. We sat on the patio which seems to accommodating no matter the temp. Brussel sprouts for an app, cliche yes but these were prob the best ones i've had. I had the pork chop which was cooked med ish without having to ask. This is a good thing. Juicy and flavorful. They even had straight horseradish which I add to many pork and beef. They are vegan and gluten free accommodating, fyi. Desert I had these canoli waffles which were delicious, and the ricotta (i think) with cherries. This was the shit! Go here, chill and have a great meal for a decent price. You won't leave feeling lethargic either."}
{"text":"Their buckwheat noodle salad is amazing ... the taste was spot on.  Loaded with kale, noodles, avocado, mango and a chili-lime dressing, I could probably eat that once a week and not get sick of it.  My only gripe is that I got it with shrimp, which were inside the salad, with their tails on.  =/  If your going to put shrimp in something, the tails should be off.  I don't wanna put my fingers in my salad pulling off tails.  The drink menu is good, lots of wine, nice beer selection.  Mixed drinks are fairly priced.  I was here with a group of 8 and on a week night it was fairly easy to get a reservation. My group also enjoyed the carbonara, gnocchi with short ribs, cauliflower grits ... the charred brussel sprouts were good, but a tad too charred for some at our table.  The salted chocolate chip cookies with chocolate milk was a big hit for dessert.  I would definitely eat here again though based on that salad alone.  If in the area, happy hour here would be great too!"}
{"text":"Great food here.

We were so hungry we forgot to take some of the pictures.  

We had the mushroom and boursin cheese flatbread.  Soo delicious!! You have to eat it when it is hot and melting.  We both loved it so much!!  5-stars.

The bruschetta was okay.  We ordered burrata cheese, candied pecans, and prosciutto.  2.5 stars.  

The charred brussel sprouts was very good.  4-stars.

Alas, the NW Oysters were very fresh.  Surprisingly. 4-stars"}
{"text":"Richard the manager was very nice and accommodating.  I highly recommend th
He Brussels sprouts!  Weird wall paper"}
{"text":"My kids live their brunch waffles and I love their grilled chicken sandwich.   Great environment with cozy booths.   One of my favorites"}
{"text":"I'm very \"meat and potatoes\" and the food at this restaurant was very...fancy for my tastes. For the appetizer, I shared the Brussels Sprouts with my colleagues. It was first time having them and they were rather tasty (I maybe would have added some sea salt to them though.) For my entree, I ordered the Crispy grouper sandwich. The fish was very well cooked but not very seasoned. It came with the Parmesan fries which were ok. The dessert was very good (cookie and milk) and the lemonade was very VERY tart. Overall, would I come here again? Eh, maybe. But honestly, just give me ribs and some plain french fries or sweet potato fries and I'll be happier."}
{"text":"I've only visited for cocktails and apps and have never been let down. Fantastic, attentive and funny servers. Adorable restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, brussel sprouts a must! Our waiter (Tony) was awesome, and hilarious, he made our experience go from 4 stars to 5 stars."}
{"text":"My mother and girlfriend were satisfied, however I was not. This is my first Yelp by the way, and in 35 years  I can count on one hand how many times I've expressed my complaints at to my server. I worked in restaurants for over 10 years (5 of those years spent in kitchen management). 

I ordered the Sea Bass in daily special. FOR $32. It came with an okay tasting clam pasta as a side. The piece of Sea Bass was, for lack of a better word, pathetic. Is was a measly over seasoned tail piece. As a kitchen manager I would have never let that plate leave the kitchen. I waited politely for the server to check on our meals, and expressed my concern. She spoke to her manager and returned with nothing but an excuse and an apology. BAD MOVE MR. MANAGER. All you had to do was offer me a more respectable piece of fish worthy of a $32 price tag. My family and I will not be returning. And I will be sure to let my friends no there are plenty of other establishments on Camelback they can enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"We had a group of 5 that experienced this great new spot last night! We were greeted with a smile promptly at the door and seated quickly in our reserved section. Our server Tony was at our table within minuets taking our drink orders. I got the Blueberry Smash.....so good! Others had the Fluer Di Lis & Strawberry Martini. We started with the goat cheese bake & Brussel sprouts, both delicious! Dinner consisted of the sausage flatbread, crab cakes & steak gnocchi. As if that wasn't enough food we ended with their French press coffee, chocolate cheesecake & ricotta desert. This place is a must try! Sit in Tony's section, he's the best! We all will definitely be repeat visitors! Check Twisted Root out!!!!"}
{"text":"Vibes: 5.0
Food: 3.5

Dropped by Twisted Grove with a few friends right after defeating finals and was more than ready to have a few drinks and stuff my face full of food. In terms of location, this place is a bit removed, but it was a bit nice to explore. 

The atmosphere inside this restaurant was great and I honestly wouldn't have minded sitting inside or outside since both areas looked great and felt super inviting. Now in terms of food, we ordered the eggplant stack (which came with fries), the mushroom flatbread, and a club sandwich. We also grabbed the fleur de lis, strawberry bellini, and a beer. The drinks were delicious across the board, but there were a few inconsistencies with the food. The eggplant stack itself wasn't that great though the fries on the side were delicious. The eggplant was sliced a bit too thick and had a really oily/fried after taste that made it super unappealing. A bit sad because the mushroom flatbread was out of this world amazing and I would go back and order that in a heartbeat! The club sandwich was good -- aka as expected. 

Overall, a cool place to go if you're in the area, but beware of the fact that the food is somewhat of a hit or miss depending on what you get."}
{"text":"No onions!! Yay! These people did a great job with my stupid food allergy and made sure I left fat and happy!!  The prime rib was perfectly medium rare and the knickerbocker was my favorite beverage of the night!   Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for some happy hour grub and left pretty disappointed. I will say that this review is specifically for their happy hour only and not anything else. Drink specials were pretty good. Not that great a selection of beer though. My wife absolutely loved their oysters but I'm not a big oyster fan so that didn't really count for me. One of the biggest disappointments of the night was the picnic chicken and the crispy fish tacos. The picnic chicken was not crispy at all due to the sauce on the outside and the fish tacos just really didn't have good flavor. Fish wasn't that crispy and there was just too much stuff on it that over complicated it. Last thing was the grilled cheese board. I would have been fine with this grilled cheese sandwich from a fast food restaurant but definitely not a place like this. Tasted like they toasted some wonder bread and put some mediocre cheese in the middle. The restaurant itself is very nice and modern but the food was nothing special at all. Entrees sounded good so I might come back but not for a while."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend and our two friends. We called to make reservations and only 8:15pm was available on Friday night! We took it and I am glad we did! Matthew was our server and he was awesome. He explained the menu since we were newbies and we decided to start with the Brussel sprouts. Yum. They were awesome and I hate Brussel sprouts! Get them, for real.

For entrees, we did the Gnoochi and short rib and salmon and cauliflower. The Gnoochi and short rib was so delicious, I highly recommend. My boyfriend liked the salmon and the cauliflower was yummy as well. We had the monkey bread and cookies for dessert. Can't go wrong with either. 

I really enjoyed our dinner and loved the atmosphere! I don't think this place will have any problem staying in business, they definitely know what they are doing! Check it out and request Matthew."}
{"text":"Went randomly looking g for a good lunch.  

Holy heck this place was good.  I had the French dip and was overwhelmed with how good it was.

Wife had the chicken BLT and was as amazed as I was."}
{"text":"Fantastic burrata and locally grown heirloom tomato plate followed by Italian grinder special and tasty garlic Parmesan frites.  Excellent service at the bar. The owner was checking on diners and appeared to have a great rapport with both clients and servers alike. Looking forward to another exciting meal soon."}
{"text":"My family and I an amazing experience here! Everything we tried was five stars. Our incredibly helpful server, Matthew, was wonderful and even remembered all of our names. We went with all of his suggestions and were very pleased with each. First, we tried three of the bruschettas and each one was even better than the next, though I have to say, the bacon and arugula was my favorite. We also got a small plate of twisted oysters. Even if oysters don't appeal to you, the spinach, relish, and dressing atop the broiled oysters made this dish so flavorful and appetizing.  The twisted noodle salad with steak was a refreshing and interesting plate like nothing I've had before. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium, as ordered. Our table also loved the crab cakes, which were meaty and delicately prepared with a side of coleslaw and crispy fries. My favorite side was the cauliflower grits. They were unlike anything I've had before and added a new twist to a classic dish. For dessert, the cookies were a perfect balance of sweet and salty. The only thing that would have made them better is a bowl of vanilla ice cream! 

After our superb dining experience last night, we are ordering take out from the Twisted Grove tonight! I can't wait to try everything else on the menu! 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"Was just driving around Scottsdale and came across this place. Decided to stop in for a quick lunch. The food was delicious and the service was swift. I would definitely eat hear again. Yummy."}
{"text":"I have been to Twisted Grove a couple of times over the last year and have always had a great experience. This last time I ate there I noticed that the refills are constant and almost appear out of nowhere- something that stands out in comparison to other restaurants. What really made this experience great is how friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable the manager Travis was. He checked in on my group a couple times and was very helpful when we were deciding what to order! I will definitely be back 1. For the Brussels Sprouts (literally the best I have ever had) and 2. Because of the great service from our server and the manager Travis!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here and the service has always been gray.  They have Happy Hour 3-6 in the entire restaurant and not just the bar, which I love.  Initially gave this place four stars but updating to a five since I have tried a few new things.  Prime rib sliders are amazing (this coming from someone who normally won't touch prime rib), as is the Angry Bird Flatbread and the crab cakes.  I didn't think the bruschetta or mushroom pasta was anything to write home about. 

As for drinks, the Fleur de Lis has become my favorite drink in town.  The Paloma was good (fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, but could not taste any alcohol).  The Collins tasted like vodka soda with a splash of lemon if you like that kind of thing (I prefer a little more fruit flavor)."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant for the first time, after reading the Yelp reviews.  The drinks were good , fresh grapefruit juice and very cold beer.  The crab cakes were good, a little under cooked. My husband loved his tri tip sandwich.  The bill for lunch was $60 before tip. I give this place a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place was really good. Crab cakes were tasty which is hard to find out here. Service was also great I came with some family that was in town and they liked it as well."}
{"text":"A solid 4 star! Would've been 5 but 1 star off due to disproportionate seasoning (mushroom pasta under seasoned, Cavatelli tad too salty). 

 Started off with a Twisted Shandy, Victory Lap, which was subtle but refreshing. Twisted Oysters are definitely worth trying. They are just kissed by a flame to warm them but 3/5 oysters were cooked perfectly (the other 2 almost perfect). Finished with a brownie chocolate cheesecake that was decadent but not overly sweet. 

The portions were great. The atmosphere perfect. Wait staff attentive & friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just the best! My sister and I decided to try this because we love Grassroots which also owns this restaurant. Everything about this restaurant is fabulous! The service, the food! There is a grouper fish sandwich which is to die for. The only thing I was disappointed about is that they serve wine in a stemless glass, which would be ok, but the glass is as thick as a jelly glass. I just love a light thin glass to drink my wine in. Also, the pours are stingy. I also want to add, the customers were such a diverse age which I love. I loved the restaurant and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a lovely meal here while in town from Seattle. There are so many places in Scottsdale, it was a bit overwhelming to figure out where to go on our one night out. I am so glad we ended up here! The menu is a bit broad, but everything we ordered was wonderful! We started with the artichoke appetizer, which I highly recommend for a not so filling appetizer and one that's easy to share. For entrees (after much deliberation), we ordered the gnocchi w/ short rib and the crab cake entree. The gnocchi was pillowy while also being crispy. My mom always talks about Maryland crab cakes that are \"no filler, just crab.\" And that is exactly how I would describe this crab cake. See picture for the huge chunks of crab! We sat at the bar, and the service was great. My one complaint is that they have the \"false bottom\" wine glasses that make it seem like you are getting a huge glass of wine- when really it's just a normal size! A bit tacky, but truly that was my only very small complaint."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and loved the oysters and fish tacos. The picnic chicken is also excellent. Great atmosphere and very friendly bartenders!"}
{"text":"Great spot.  Brussels sprouts is not something on my must-try list but the way it was prepared here was very good. A little sweet and charred, and the garlic mixed in was flavored very well.  The crab cakes tasted very fresh, and went great with the coleslaw.  The twisted noodle salad with steak (prepared medium) was awesome with the right amount of vinaigrette.  The chocolate cheesecake was like a chocolate overload with the brownie crust, but very good."}
{"text":"The service was good but the happy hour food was disappointing. It left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"What is all the hoopla about this place? A very limited menu. I think the food is ok, but nothing to write home about. No soups no burgers no salmon. It's more of a bar that happens to have food. No big deal. In the beginning the intention was an Italian place. They should have stayed with that plan."}
{"text":"Visited Twisted Grove for the first time and had a great experience. The food was amazing and our service was impeccable. Taylor our server, was beyond helpful and kind. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We ate at Twisted Grove Parlor one night and Grassroots a second night. I recommend both. The food was very good. I got the mushroom pasta and my husband got the roasted chicken. We were both very happy with the food, the service and the atmosphere. A very comfortable place to eat and relax with some good food."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I live in the neighborhood and can't get enough. Food is EXCELLENT. Just looked at the menu online to see what to rave about, but this review would bee entirely too long if I wrote about everything I liked. The cocktails are great and the bar staff is very helpful and informative about their menu and wine list. If i HAD to pick some menu favorites, they would be: n.w oysters, grilled artichoke, topher's tri tip sandwich, and twisted noodle salad. Oh, and the ambiance and decor are on point too ;)"}
{"text":"Great new neighborhood spot.  It's one of those menus where everything sounds good so it's tough to decide what to get.  That's a good thing.  Next time, we may get a bunch of apps to share so we can try some different dishes.  The flatbreads and oysters were great though.  Service was friendly and prompt.  The beer list has some interesting options and I hope they'll rotate some others through.    

My only minor nitpick is the open kitchen.  Watching the food be prepared is cool and I get that concept.  What doesn't work, however, is the open dishwashing area.  They really need a door there.  It's unappetizing when seated at the bar and more so, it's crazy bright back there.  Seeing bright florescent light kills the vibe.  Again, minor nitpick and easily fixable.  This place is a welcome addition and I wish them well."}
{"text":"Fave restaurant in Phoenix and the bartender Kyla makes the best drinks and there's one waitress named Madi and she is fantastic at recommending menu items. Gr8 food, gr8 service"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Keith Sweat - Twisted)

Oh yeah Bo Bites
I got to write my reviews up
Yeah
Yelpers, help me out

(You know you want my lovin) You know I want your cookin baby
(At the Twisted Grove Parlor Bar) Yeah you got me twisted over you
(They know they got what I need) I got what I need right here baby
(So what you wanna do)


I loves this place! Twisted Grove has a rustic American feel and brunch here is perfect!  You have an option you make your own Bloody Mary here, but I'm not a big fan of making of my own drinks however I will try next time and see how I feel about it - wink!

I came here with my friend on a Saturday afternoon after a good hike.  For drinks I went for an IPA and she shot for the Sweet & Spicy cocktail; tequila, grassroots sour, jalapeno agave, and cayenne salt around the rim. Overall, a solid drink and I always enjoy a spicy drink, with a full half jalapeno atop!  

For our food I ordered the Southern Sunrise; a Green Chile Tamale with house made chorizo and black bean pico.  My friend went for the Twisted Noodle Salad which came with buckwheat soba noodles, kale, avocado, mango, cucumber, arugula, scallions, herbs, coconuts, peanuts, chili-lime vinaigrette and shrimps.  My dish was phenomenal!  I love tamales in general, but the sweetness of the tortilla puree really brought out the taste.  The black bean pico was cooked to perfection with a hint of cilantro spiciness.  The chorizo had an over-easy egg atop; what doesn't go well with eggs these days!?  The salad had a shmorgishborg of ingredients that at the end, jelled well together.  It was crunchy and subtle with a sweet and sour punch to your palates!

Service was on top of things here and again; I love the ambiance!  Overall, the food played music to my palates and this is a definitely a star in my books! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is actually really good. Atmosphere is cool and we have liked everything we have gotten.
The picnic chicken on happy hour menu is phenomenal. Incredibly flavorful sauce and soooo yummy.  Also the prime rib sliders are fantastic. We had a few tasty cocktails as well. It's on the higher side of prices for what it is but the ingredients are quality and presented well so I guess it's worth it."}
{"text":"Very poor form by the manager Amy last Friday night, she kicked my wife and her friends out of the restaurant for no reason.    Amy felt the need to cut them off and threatened them if they didn't leave.  
We can't figure out why this place gets such good reviews when the management is so unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Over 20 reviews about crab cakes here, I had to try... It had great flavor and I enjoyed every bite of it. The dish was served with French fries, and flavored with rosemary, thyme and cheese. I thought a glass of nice Italian red would go really well with the meal. Too bad I had to go back to work after lunch. Instead I ordered iced green tea with splash of pomegranate juice, it had refreshing taste.

My friend ordered salmon entree and from what I can see, it looked very moist inside and tasty. He said it was really good. 

Before I decided what to eat for lunch, first thing I saw on the menu was desert. Tres Leches... While it wasn't the best I had (the best I had was at a Columbian restaurant in Florida.), I ate the whole thing in my own. Never crossed my mind about sharing. If you look at the picture I posted here, it was huge! I wasn't sure if I could finish it, but it had that sweet milky taste to it, it was gone before I knew it. It was so light, it didn't give me that heartburn feeling I get from some other desert.

Service wasn't what I was hoping. He said as soon as we walked in, he was swamped. He was walking around constantly and was busy. He was apologetic about slow service and did the best he could. Too bad it was understaffed. 

They have other dishes on the menu I think will go well with wine. Would like to come back for dinner someday."}
{"text":"We wanted to try out the new Twisted Root and Parlor restaurant and so we went for lunch yesterday.  We started off with the brussel sprouts appetizer and oh my goodness, it was soooooooooooo good!!!!  My husband had the grouper sandwich which was outstanding and I had the crab cake with greens salad and it was so delicious that I can't say enough about it!!!  Our server, Lindsay, was adorable and extremely attentive.  She was just delightful and made our dining experience one to never forget!  We can't wait to return and try other items on the menu!  THIS IS NOW OUR NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great evening!  Visiting Scottsdale with an old friend and found this place on Yelp.  Love the decor - great vibe and fun.  The food is amazing - as was our server John!  We started with the delicious brussel sprouts - and they lived up to their reputation!  We then shared the Cavateli Carbonara and the White Sea Bass.  Both dishes were well executed and worth having a second time!  Nice wine list - we ordered a great white blend that complimented the entire meal.  Took a piece of decadent chocolate cheese cake home with us to enjoy later.
John was the great combination of professional and personable....you will be lucky to sit in his section!"}
{"text":"Finally a new restaurant that has good food! Great service, best martini I've ever had, food was on point. Just wish we lived closer."}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing dinner ever and it was our first visit here.... Stephanie was our waitress and she was fabulous for multiple reasons.. she made some Dynamite suggestions as to the best entrees... The short ribs and Gnochi  were to die for as  e was Seabass and mushroom risotto... The desserts that  she suggested were the best ever... Butterscotch pecan pie and tres leche cake... Unusual menu items complimentary valet and an incredible atmosphere...."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. Champagne bar with home made peach and strawberry purée. Our waiter John, couldn't have been more pleasant and knowledgable about the menu. We split the breakfast club sandwich with grilled broccolini and Angry Bird flatbread. Thicker than normal crunchy crust was great.  Excellent place. You need to try it."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my fiancé graduating with his master's degree. Food is great! Service is slooooow. Which isn't a big deal if you're not in a hurry, which we were not. We just began to feel badly because the restaurant was scheduled to close but we had no signs of our check. We wanted dessert but didn't want to wait another ten minutes to get our waiter back. We honestly would probably come back here because the food is well done, we'd just cross our fingers we didn't get the same waiter."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner!!

I have been trying new places lately and hadn't been here yet even though it is right down the street.  I was thoroughly impressed!  The atmosphere was lively, yet intimate.  Our server, Amber, was fantastic and her recommendations were on point.  We started with the goat cheese appetizer which was delicious...even though I really wanted the brussell sprouts that she recommended (which is their signature, and has a gorgeous presentation!)  I had he crab cake dinner, and it was one of the best I've ever had.  Fresh, tons of crab meat, and flavor like no other.  The creamed spinach was equally fantastic and I could have eaten a whole plate of just that.  Drink-wise, the cocktail selection was unique yet familiar.  Also fabulous!

No complaints at all....cannot wait to go back and try more from the menu!"}
{"text":"Had an AMAZING experience at Twisted Grove. Our server Emma made us feel right at home (but with much better food). I went back in he same week because I couldn't stay away. We were LUCKY enough to have Emma both times. The Brussel sprouts were to DIE for, I could eat them everyday. Carbonara and bruschetta are a must try as well. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I would give more than 5 stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant, owned by the same people that own Wally's and Grassroots. We had the crab cakes which are excellent, very little breading and lots of crab. In queried where the crab came from as I heard many restaurants are using crab from Asian country. This was from the gulf. Excellent, served with a small side salad. Excellent and flavorful caesar salad and the flat bread with sausage and onion strings on the top is the best. Just remember to order it without the dandelion greens on top ( they call it frazee) Service is excellent and is a team type concept, anyone on the wait team who is available helps you. Good place, give it a try."}
{"text":"Came here Tuesday night for dinner.  The parking lot of this entire strip mall is pretty busy and walking up to the restaurant we noticed it was pretty busy inside, especially for a Tuesday night.

The hostess was speaking with someone else on staff but attended to us promptly.  We were seated and I'm not sure which came first, us sitting down or our server coming to ask us if she could get us any drinks.  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  She then said she would go bring us some waters and give us a few minutes.

She returned promptly.  We did not specifically order drinks, just hot water with lemon.  Needless to say the service was great the rest of the evening.  There was only a stretch of time where she disappeared for a while but it was due to her getting a few large groups all at once.

For food between our party of 3 we ordered the arcadia club, angry bird flat bread, and 4 sides, cauliflower, broccolini, spaghetti squash and loaded smashed potatoes.  The sandwich came with parmesan-garlic fries.

Taste-wise everything was delicious.  The fries were crispy and the seasoning was perfect.  The cauliflower had a nice roasted flavor.  The potatoes were nice and cheesy and had a great balance between the different elements, and I was able to get all of the flavors in each bite I had.

I would've given 5 stars but I took 1 star off for the flat bread.  This might be a definition difference.  The flavor on it was great, it was just the flat bread itself wasn't really what I was expecting.  I expect flat bread to be about a quarter of an inch thick, maybe even half an inch thick.  This flat bread was probably an inch and a half to 2 inches thick.  Very bready."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have said. The food and ambiance is great. Don't forget to get the brussel sprouts. They're the best anywhere in the valley. The happy hour drink and appetizer specials are also great. I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"LOVE! This was our favorite place and by far the best food of all the restaurants we tried out on our visit to Scottsdale from Maryland. MUST try the Brussels Sprouts appetizer - my fiancé who is by far NOT a vegetable fan reluctantly tried them and INHALED them! He had the grouper sandwich which he raved about, I had the eggplant sandwich (which he also took a tasted and loved) with side of spaghetti squash....I am a huge eggplant fan and this was by far probably the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Waiter was nice. The place is clean and rustic. We went for HH and I thought the prices high, especially the salmon poke. Picnic chicken was okay, my son liked everything , but Sazerac for $9 was his reason for stopping here.

Since it's my review there's nothing I had that would make me return. I thought the Shishito
peppers were too hot for my liking. The Prime rib slider was okay. No garnishes like a little lettuce or carrot for the chicken. 

We did get a coup for a free ice cream next door for the baby."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Thanks to Liz and all the staff it was a great night! Drink recommendation - the sweet and spicy. Appetizer - charred Brussels sprouts. Entree - pasta bolognese special. Dessert - tres leches. All phenomenal and will definitely go back and recommend to others!!"}
{"text":"Guessing I caught them on an off night. Food was below average, Luke warm at best. No flavor (tasted like pasta in a box). The service was horrible. Took more than 5 mins for server to greet us and the place was empty. After dropping our food off server didn't think necessary to follow up to check on us. Was my first n will be my last visit to this place."}
{"text":"Not from the area so was excited to try something new...this place DIDNT DISAPPOINT! What a treat! Loved everything from the fun and different cocktails, tastefully tantalizing appetizers, amazing chicken and short rib dinner, and can't forget the ridiculously yummy chocolate chip cookies and milk for dessert. Heaven!"}
{"text":"If I hadn't looked carefully at my food I would've end up in the hospital. I told the waiter I can't take chili so I ordered a pasta dish to be safe. The dish come with full of chili flakes all over it. I told the waiter and he said it's just chili flakes. 
The manager didn't seem to care either.  they should pay attention to what the customer says before killing or putting someone in the hospital."}
{"text":"We just tried Twisted Grove today and it was an interesting experience.  We started off with the Bloody Mary bar which was pretty good.  They had candied bacon, olives, blue cheese stuffed olives, horseradish, celery, pepperoncini and many hot sauces.  The frozen glass was a nice touch.  My wife ordered the crab cake and salad.  They didn't have any dressings without dairy in them except for oil and vinegar.  When she asked if she could have a different side instead of the salad, the bartender said they won't substitute in the lower priced items but if she ordered a high priced item, they would substitute the side.  Really Twisted Grove??  Anyhow, the crab cake was delicious.  I ordered the Cavatelli pasta.  It was good but could have used more sauce.  The portion size was more than enough.  Overall, would have been a great experience had the staff responded in a way that said they wanted us to enjoy the experience.  Saying no to a substitute side because they don't have any dressings that don't have dairy in them is a turn off.  Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"This is on our \"must return again\" list. All four of us were happy with items selected. Many veggie choices were selected/prepared with tasty results and gluten free. Crab cake was a hit. Outdoor seating area was promptly heated at sunset and tables were spaced to facilitate easy conversation with table mates."}
{"text":"Twisted Grove is a nice \"neighborhood\" restaurant with some speciality items worth me taking a special trip.  The crab cakes are real lump crab without the bread. The salmon was delicious. I have eaten the sliders, which are good but priced a little high for happy hour in my opinion. Ambiance was conversational level on a Sunday evening and a Friday lunch.

They have a deal with a sweet shop next door for chocolate cookies which are out of this world.

I was annoyed by 2 flies during my meal, and the menu does not include various steak (prime rib after 5) otherwise I plan to visit again for a bite when I am in the area."}
{"text":"So tonight my family and I visited this location for the first time and our experience was amazing!  The food, service, and ambiance was beyond expectations considering this location just opened this week! Honestly, everything was amazing and 
I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.  Tonight we started with the charred Brussels along with the  common ground Burrata.  For our entrees we enjoyed the swordfish, crab cakes, and angry bird flatbread which were to die for!  Finishing course was  tres leches cake.  The sparkling rose and a specialty cocktail called the French quarter were also very tasty!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  But the service was marginal.  Management does not seem to grasp the concept of customer service.  When 5 dinners are ordered and only 4 come out and you ask the server what happened and she says oh the kitchen had a mix up, wouldn't you think that as a matter of routine customer service the management would make some offer to make up for the embarrassment?  Apparently not.  We had to bring it up and at first was told that the extra glass of wine could not be comped because \"I apologized for the dinner mixup\".  Really!  Only after taking it up with management was anything done.  With all the restaurants in the area, the food is not so exemplary that I need to go back when there are far too many other places to got that do understand customer service."}
{"text":"The Fleur-de-Lis cocktail was good, but the Sweet & Spicy was amazing. It is like a lightly spicy margarita (sounds weird, but tastes INCREDIBLE!) 

For food, we split the charred brussels sprouts and I ordered the crispy grouper sandwich with a side of cauliflower grits. 

The cauliflower was very tasty, but my grouper was a skosh underdone. I decided to just go with it, but didn't really enjoy it.  Perhaps I'm just not a fan of grouper, but I doubt I'll ever order it again. 

Service was great and everyone seemed very helpful. My only suggestion would be to knock a couple of dollars off the $9 cocktail menu."}
{"text":"I like this place. Food was good and so was service. We ordered pork dish and salmon dish, we all enjoyed it. Also artichoke dip was great :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. A good place for a date night. Not for the single scene."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch to catch up since I haven't seen her in a long time. We wanted a seat outside but it was too sunny no shading so the hostess gave us a nice seat inside next to the big open windows. We felt like we were outside and had a nice breeze. 

We were given menus and clearly hadn't looked at them yet when the waitress came over to get our drink orders. She seemed a little rushed so we quickly put in our drink orders. I ordered the grapefruit la croix with vodka with an orange slice. It was ok. La croix is so light in flavor I didn't taste the grapefruit really. I would have preferred a grapefruit vodka with it too. The drink was very light and would be nice on a hot day, but I probably wouldn't order this again. We still hadn't looked at the menu when she quickly came back with our drinks and tried to take our lunch orders. I felt so rushed and pressured. I don't know what the hurry was the entire restaurant was pretty much open and there was no wait. I didn't even get to look at the menu I felt so pressured I just ordered the first thing I saw on there, which was the bruschetta board. 

The board gave you an option of 3 flavor choices. I chose the avocado one, the burrata one, and the goat cheese date one. My main compliant about all three of them was with the bread. The bread slices were thick, which was nice, but they were also really hard. If it's going to be thick, less hard would be nice or just make the bread less thick.  I wasn't particular fond of what was going on with my bread slices. Of the 3, my favorite was the burrata followed by the goat cheese. I didn't particularly like the avocado one (this one was actually recommended to me by the waitress). The avocado one came with pickled onions on top and apparently jalapeno. I didn't taste or feel any spiciness from jalapeno. I just felt like the pickled onions just ruined the avocado flavor. The avocado was looked super fresh and was beautifully cut. The goat cheese date one came with arugala on top with candied pecans and a honey drizzle and it was delicious. It wasn't overly sweet. The tangy goat cheese went well with the sweetness of the dates and honey. And it was nice to have a little crunchiness with the pecans. The burrata had a spicy tomato jam on it with arugala as well. I didn't find the tomato jam spicy at all. I actually found it on the very lightly sweet side. The nuttiness from the arugala paired well with the burrata and the tomato jam. It was really good. However, as good as these are. They don't nearly compare to another restaurant that also has bruschetta boards with similar bruschetta options.  

And in the theme of being rushed when I wasn't done with my plate the waitress tried to take my plate away. What is the rush?!

I may need to come back here and try this place for dinner. I may just have had an off lunch experience."}
{"text":"TGP+B has a lot of things going for it, but didn't quite win me over. The bar area is great for a date night or meeting with a group- nice long tables and patio seating for when the weather is good. 

Classic cocktail list sounded good, but the knickerbocker and boulevard were weak and I just didn't love the flavor combo in the french quarter. Good deals on wine during HH, so maybe stick to that?

Pick 3 bruschettas for $10 during HH, good but not awesome. The burrata was good, though the jam lacked the spice indicated on the menu. Goat cheese and dates was a little sweet, but still ok. The avocado was disappointing- the thin slices of avo were not nearly enough for the slice of bread. The price is a good deal, just wish they toppings were a bit stronger.

Salmon wonder salad was tasty with kale, beets, perfectly cooked salmon, and a very good dressing. Would definitely order this again.

Sides were $5 each. Broccolini was OK, not great- couldn't really taste the goddess dressing. Roasted cauliflower, however, was brilliant. Perfectly cooked with a tasty tahini sauce.

Overall, some hits, some almost-but-not-quite there hits. Servers were friendly and the place has a good vibe."}
{"text":"It's okay... used to be better. There are a few good items on the menu but overpriced. You're paying for the Scottsdale vibe and decor. I prefer to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"We couldn't make up our mind last night about where to go and found this place on yelp.  Third restaurant in this location since we moved to Arizona, which wasn't that long ago!  When I saw that it was the same owners as grassroots (somewhere we were considering but had a 30 min wait), I insisted we try it.

We arrived around 8:45 on a Friday night and were seated immediately.  There were plenty of others there, but not having to wait was nice. Overall, the service was a bit slow for my tastes, but it wasn't bad. 

The food was all pretty good. We ordered a ton for 3 people and had a bunch of leftovers. Sad, because I wanted dessert!  My favorite was the grouper sandwich- best fish sandwich I remember having!  I also really enjoyed the grits. I ended up taking most of my noodle salad home, but I'm looking forward to having it for lunch today!

Overall, good experience. I hope this one makes it so there are more close-by restaurants that we like. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was fantastic!!! Great atmosphere... rich tasty food. Love everything I got. I was say it's a 5 star. I would forsure come back again and bring others for the experience. Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, it's just great food, friendly staff, good service for just opening but will get real good just like Grass Roots. If you like Oysters, Pasta and creative dishes you'll love this place.  You need to go in just to see the decor, well done!! Restaurants are in their blood, enjoy! You'll thank me."}
{"text":"I'm actually sitting at the restaurant right now...food is great, but it's actually comical how bad the service is.  It's as if I'm at a Dave Chapelle comedy block party. That's exactly how funny it is.  Eddie Murphy in his prime, and I feel like I got Bill Cosby-ed. Horrendous.
I waited 45 mins for crab cakes that's cost me $32.00. (Which by the way, you can't order ala carte).  Based on the price I paid ($32.00), the time I waited (45 mins) and how much time it takes to make (assuming it's pre-made) (15 mins) you actually owe me at least $15 for eating said crab cakes. Maryland would be disappointed.
The waiter told me the kitchen was backed up, but there were at minimum 26 people in the kitchen, no way they got backed up with the influx of 20 for happy hour.  Eh, idk maybe it's tough to keep up with all those orders of short rib sliders.  
I thought my waiter looked like Bruno Mars, but I must have had the nose bleed seats at his illustrious Madison Square Garden show.

P.S. Esteé Lauder needs to help the hostess with her hicky situation."}
{"text":"I love this new neighborhood restaurant/bar! It's eclectic, great music, the menu selection is fantastic and the staff is super friendly. I had the swordfish with lemon beurre blanc sauce and it wasn't fishy at all, it was light and tasty. My husband had the salmon and it was perfectly cooked, he devoured it! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was was definitely worth the drive to Scottsdale. From the first bite to the last sip of my drink it was outstanding. Our server, Austin was sweet and courteous and knew exactly what to recommend to make our meal a perfection ! His attentiveness and friendliness made our experience superb! He was worth every penny! We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"My first time here. Took an out of town guest based on Yelp reviews. Really quite good. Innovative menu where everything comes together and much thought is put into making sure tastes are balanced and complimentary. Upon learning it was out first visit, Austin sent out a complimentary appetizer, the  Brussel sprouts.  Excellent. We had crab cake appetizer, gnocchi with short ribs and the wild mushroom pappardelle. All innovative, tasty and well portioned. The food was nice and hot when it arrived. Restaurant is clean. Environment is neighborhood folksy Americana."}
{"text":"All I can say is BRUSSEL SPROUTS! GET THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS! They are amazing!! Probably the best I have ever had. I came here with my family. My dad isn't not a fan of brussel sprouts but you better believe he loved them here. They were crispy yet tender! We loved the balsamic drizzle and the bacon mixed in was to die for. 
I had a sandwich which was good! Some of the other dishes we ordered we the roasted chicken, salad and flatbread. All the food was great! Our server was great and attentive! He also let us know they are affiliated with Grassroots and the sweet shop right across the street! Very cool  
But, the stand out here was those brussel sprouts! I can't tell you how many I saw leaving the kitchen to go to other tables. I can't wait to go back and order them again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner at Twisted Grove.  Interesting menu and I really enjoyed my Wild Mushroom Papardelle.  The service was good and the ambiance is nice.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and the diversity of the menu.  It offers many choices to come back for and I will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Service was good. Artichokes were delicious.  Drinks made the right way. This is a great place that understands service and quality."}
{"text":"Came for Friday happy hour.  Drinks were delicious and actually packed a punch (which can be difficult at many happy hours) and the food was incredible!  Had the brussel sprouts appetizer and the angry bird flat bread.  Both were better than expected!  Only downside- continually had to request water refills.  Our server was friendly.  Would definitely return when back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"BEST DAMN BRUSSELS SPROUTS I HAVE EVER HAD ANYWHERE!!!!!  

Great place to hang with friend.  Celebrate a birthday or promotion... lol.  Who gets those these days.  

Waiter has a cute butt too."}
{"text":"This, our second visit to Twisted Grove, was as exceptional as the first. Our maiden visit was during AZ Restaurant Week, and the service, vibe, cocktails, and menu was top notch. My dirty martini (Ketel One) was expertly crafted, as was the fella's Sazerac. Much ado has been made about the roasted Brussels sprouts, and they did not fail to impress, and set expectations high for our entrees. My short rib gnocchi was one of those first bites where everything stopped, and my eyes rolled as I marveled, thinking 'when was the last time something was THIS good?' The layers of flavor, the succulent meat, and the house-made gnocchi are pure comfort food. The fella's prime rib and mashed potatoes rivaled the finest steakhouse in town, perfectly cooked, juicy, flavorful, and substantial. The tres leches cake was silky and sweet, and enough for 4 to share. After this meal, I wondered if our experience was a happy fluke, and because the menu has so many tempting options, we returned in anticipation. Once again, the hospitality was prompt, personal, welcoming, and warm. Our classic cocktails were, again, sophisticated and balanced. The fella contemplated the chicken, but was ultimately won over a second time by the prime rib and loaded taters - yes, it's that good. I opted for the crab cakes with mixed louis slaw and Parmesan frites. No fake k-rab goin' down in this kitchen. We are talking two substantial medallions of lump crab meat, expertly and lightly pan fried with a delicate crust and no grease. A snowdrift of freshly grated Parmesan blanketed my warm, crispy frites. The side of louis slaw is, simply, magic. Whatever ingredient alchemy the kitchen has introduced to the humble shredded cabbage, it is decadently delicious and flavorful. Magic, I tell you. I'm already planning my next visit to Twisted Grove, and I hope you are, too. Cheers, friends."}
{"text":"My God!  THIS PLACE IS DA BOMB!  First time here and everything was incredible!  I eat out 6 days a week and I know great food, and this place has got it. Start out with the Brussel sprout app and you will know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Great place! My husband and I came here not knowing anything about this place. I loved the atmosphere, great lighting and a super cool bar and patio. The drinks are all signature and the bartender Chris was AMAZING!!!!! I had some great drinks and the oysters were delicious. It's nice to have a bartender that is cool, can talk football, yet be very professional and nice. We had a great time and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The restaurant is great looking. I cannot say one negative word. Try it....you will not regret
I have had the tri tip, all the salads and the pasta dishes. They were all wonderful. I cannot say enough good"}
{"text":"Went there last night for a office happy hour.  Ordered a ginger beer. Pretty simple. Start with a clean glass, add ice and add ginger beer. Twice I was served a ginger beer with something colorful in it. First glass had something red. Second glass had something orange. We made fun of how it appeared to be crawling, hopefully from the carbonation. But, if a drink is sent back because the customer saw something it it try to make sure the second one is clean. Just sayin!"}
{"text":"This place is just OK. Food is really not special and service felt forced. 
Hostess couldn't smile, and server help rolled her eyes as she tried to set the wrong order in front of my wife. Later, another server tried to bring us someone else's order. My salmon was sub par, not much flavor. Just another chain. Kind of pricey too."}
{"text":"Really great food. Really great service. The Grouper sandwich was a-mazing. The butterscotch pecan pie was a sweets lover's dream. (T.G.-You must get a small, ice cream only, freezer, though.)I actually came back two weeks later with my hub and ma-in-law and we had crispy grouper sammies all around. It was a busy Friday night, so service was decent, considering. The spin dip was really good. I can't wait to go back for the tres leches cake. See you on my birthday. ;0)"}
{"text":"We have had one meal here so far.  I call this restaurant space the \"restaurant killer.\"  No one has been able to make it.  Something is off about this corner spot...rent must be too high or something but I've seen 3-4-5 places killed in less than 18 months at this spot.  Our first i]overall opinion is Twisted grove is okay.  My wife enjoyed her food, I thought mine was just okay.  Great little bar area.  Good service.  We will return."}
{"text":"Sat for 15 min and no one ever came to the table and the place had maybe 6 tables in it. We left and walked to the melting pot. Best decision of the night."}
{"text":"Holy cow is this place AMAZING! Beautiful, tasteful and colorful decor. Very hip yet relaxing. All of their food has a fresh in flavor, fun an inventive twist. Try the Cobb salad. Not your average presentation, with it's large pieces of dates and other fresh ingredients yet it is hands down the most refreshing bite of salad I've had in a long time. The artichokes are amazing and I wish I would have ordered more. The brussel sprouts are a top seller and the rustic presentation, crisp textured sprouts and sweet bacon confirm why. If I lived on Scottsdale I would go here all the time!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere on the patio. Music isn't too loud. I had the crispy grouper and asked for it grilled. It was fantastic. The cauliflower side was great too. We also ordered the kids Mac n cheese and the crab cakes. The food and service were great."}
{"text":"I'm ecstatic! I found my new go to restaurant!!! I loved the casual atmosphere, the friendly staff, the prices and of course, the food here is delightful!!!!

We came early enough to take advantage of happy hour and I first ordered the Strawberry Bellini. It was sweet and perfect! Then we ordered the bruschetta board: the one with the avocado, the one with the ricotta and the one with the goat cheese. It was really good and I enjoyed every bite. Then we shared the Cavatelli Carbonara and that too was delicious! We were so happy that we wanted more! 

So we decided to order shishito peppers and one prime rib slider. After a few bites, we were stuffed and completely satisfied. When we finally received the check, we were surprised to only spend around $50, which included two alcoholic drinks. We will be definitely come back! This is a great place to bring a group of friends and hang out!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Twisted Grove Parlor + Bar on Friday night! Our server had an advanced grasp of the cocktail menu and steered me right in selecting one that I really enjoyed (Blueberry Smash!). I ordered some bruschetta for an appetizer, and the gnocchi and short rib entree.  The entree was delicious! The bruschetta was okay; toppings were tasty, but the bread was not on parr with some other bruschetta I have tried."}
{"text":"We visited with our friends who had told told us about this wonderful restaurant. We came at an off hour with our four youngish kids and sat on the patio. The server was friendly and gracious with our kids. We appreciate good food, as do our kids, so we are always on the lookout for place like Twisted Grove that has tasty high quality food, laid back atmosphere and does not just offer chicken fingers for kids! In fact we loved that the kids dishes came with broccolini (which happens to be their favorite vegetable). I am also glad we came at an off hour and didn't bother anyone with our kids in the patio--the inside looked more formal so we will have to try that on a date night. We ordered a bit everything on the recommendation of our server and veteran friends so tried the short ribs and gnocchi, eggs in a hole, noodle salad, and crab cakes. Great selection of beer and wine by the glass too. Happy to have found this spot!"}
{"text":"The food was ehhh and my flatbread took forever (30+ min) to come out so I finally just told them to put it to go. Will not be returning, there are much better restaurants in this area try one of them."}
{"text":"How does a $26 salad sound? My wife ordered a Cobb salad and it came with chicken. She asked for salmon instead. The salad was $15 which included chicken, and they charged $11 extra for the salmon, which we expected some up charge over chicken, but also expected a credit for no chicken. When we questioned this, our server went to the manager and came back only to tell us that this is how they do it. The manager never even came over in person. Very unprofessional.
The staff here is not very friendly or inviting. The smiles are forced and most don't even look you in the eye when speaking to you. The girl that brought our appetizer didn't say a word, just dropped the food off, and didn't even acknowledge my \"thank you.\" Also the wine list is a joke, only 11 bottles each of white or red and overpriced. Our first choice they didn't even have. 
We will never be back. A $26 dollar salad is ridiculous. Actually they have a different salad with salmon for $19.  The fact that the manager didn't personally come and talk to us tells me that they just don't care about their customers. If you like grossly overpriced food and wine and inept staff, then go for it!"}
{"text":"Great meal, good service, fun spot. We ate dinner here on a Saturday night and sat in the bar- the restaurant was kind of crowded so I'd recommend making a reservation, at least on the weekend! The vibe is sort of industrial but very nice and comfortable. 

We started with the artichoke and Brussels sprouts, and were not disappointed! Both were wonderful choices and came with plenty to share 4 ways. I shared the mushroom paperdelle, which was also very good. If you're hungry, I'd recommend having this one all to yourself as a half was kind of small! 

The wine list was great (plenty of good but less expensive options) and service was friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"From the start the atmosphere was soft and inviting. 
Service was friendly and engaging. The grouper sandwich pleasant take on a classic fish sandwich with plenty of flavor."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant they have the best food and wine!  My favorite red wine, that they have in stock, is predator, they also have the best tres latte cake!  the restaurant is gorgeous and the service is always top notch! Greatly, friendly, attentive staff!"}
{"text":"They were not able to accommodate a group of 5 inside at a table with chairs. We had an elderly woman in our party that could not sit in a booth. Recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"Peg and I are loyal to the chefs we love and the food that is consistently good. One of the good guys is Chris Collins (Grassroots, Wally's) and his vision has always been to be the local neighborhood place that is easily accessible both physically and financially.  This location has been open for about 3 weeks, so we checked out the \"social hour.\"  Reminiscent of Grassroots, the selection is varied and all good. The Bruschetta Board offered a sections and we chose the Mascarpone, prosciutto and sweet pepper relish; ricotta, candied bacon, and crispy onion salad, and burrata spicy tomato jam, arugula and sea salt. The prime rib slider, picnic chicken, and crispy fish tacos rounded out the meal. All tasty and all very reasonable. We left feeling like Chef Chris has again made a thoughtful choice of a place to eat!  Thanks, Chef!   Dr. B"}
{"text":"Is very good. I got the 2 potato hash on the brunch menu and its flavor shattered my wildest imagination. It's a Saturday afternoon and every other place had a long wait and this place didn't have one. Definitely a 5 of 5 from me."}
{"text":"Such an amazing restaurant! Awesome salads and appetizers. Brussel sprouts were to die for. Braised beef and gnocchi dish was absolutely delicious! Great service. Next time need to check out the deserts!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great atmosphere and great staff. Private dining room great for business meetings or personal parties. The spinach & bacon kale salad is my fav along w/the mimosa bar is perfect weekend lunch. Lots of choices w/mimosa, but strawberry purée is great...they also have peach too...yumm. Also TVs to watch whatever game is on. Overall VERY nice, chill place!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Tasty. Great service. Phenomenal. I was so impressed with this restaurant. Literally I wanted to eat everything on the menu. We had the crab cakes and short rib gnocchi which were both awesome. The Brussels sprouts are to die for. I'll be back for dinner and can't wait to try our brunch."}
{"text":"Pretty busy at night so make sure to have a reservation. The food is fantastic, highly recommend the gnochi and pappardell. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were amazing. Crab cakes are awesome.. .however hopefully we had a fluke service experience. We arrived at opening, were seated right away. Drinks and food came out fairly quickly, but after that we rarely saw our server. She said there was a large table just seated in her section, however we saw a manager and several other wait staff attending to a total of 5-6 tables, all but ours. Waited for a good 30 minutes for a to-go dessert (cookies) and the check. I got up and had to ask for both things from the hostess. Yikes guys."}
{"text":"Service - Amazing!  Food - Even better than the service.  Oysters - Crazy awesome!  Mushrooms and pasta was off the charts!!  Will be back many, many times!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for an early happy hour & dinner. We made a reservation and showed up around 3pm on a Saturday to enjoy a few drinks, an appetizer, and a meal. We enjoyed a few martinis and Mules, the Brussels sprouts appetizer, and the short rib and gnocchi dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed our time relaxing and taking in the ambience while we ate delicious food. I highly suggest this for a date night and HIGHLY suggest their happy hour! Food was impeccable."}
{"text":"First time at this gem! Do not miss ordering the grilled artichoke appetizer as it is fantastic. I was there for lunch with business clients and we ordered a salmon Caesar, burger/fries and a flatbread pizza. Nobody finished because the portions are huge! Did not even look at dessert menu.....next time as I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was one of our last dinners while visiting Scottsdale and it was very much worth it. First off this restaurant had an amazing atmosphere and comfort to it. The servers are genuine and seem to really value and care for their customers. 

But the food...the food is the reason to come. Absolutely delicious. We started with the Brussel sprouts and artichoke hearts. Both were played interestingly and the flavors were on point. Cooked well and paired with delicious sauces and other ingredients. The Brussel sprouts were definitely our favorite appetizer out of the two.

For the main items, the table ordered the crab cakes, pork chop, gnocchi & short ribs, and one of the specials that night: cavatelli with meatballs. All of the dishes were extremely fresh and full of flavor. The crab cakes were cooked well and did not have a strong fishy flavor like some do. The special was really good and was a very large portion.

Overall this restaurant was really good, offered lots of options and had reasonable prices for the quality of food that you are receiving."}
{"text":"Croque Madame & Eggs in Purgatory.
Very tasty, nice atmosphere, excellent service from our server Emma!!"}
{"text":"Is it wrong to lick the plate in public? Not when the food is this good! The crabcakes salad is without a doubt, the best I have ever had in my life! The sad thing is, I will be back here I'll too often! Travis, the bartender is phenomenal!  He suggested this item and again, he could not of been better! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday with a big group and they were super accommodating. Everyone had a great experience. The Brussels were great and I think the Cobb is my new favorite salad!"}
{"text":"Oysters for happy hour are a joke
Don't order them

Service is good tho
Didn't have dinner here"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner with a group of friends. Made dinner reservations and they prepared the table timely. The drinks were pretty good and the service was great. From what I have tried, I really liked the gnocchi short rib. The bruschetta was pretty good but I think the bread could have been better. We also ordered a prime rib to share between my boyfriend and I. We ordered medium rare but it came out really rare. It was pink. Our friend accidentally mistaken the prime rib for salmon because it was so pink. The service was great though. They immediately took corrective action and it tasted great after. I also got to try the oysters. Most of it was pretty fresh but it wasn't consistent since we had some weird tasting ones. Overall, this is a really good place to hangout and have fun with friends."}
{"text":"Best crab cake of my life!!! Every bite of deliciousness was outta the river island ballpark! Hospitality, food, ambiance, sooooooo fabulous!"}
{"text":"So good!!! My friend from out of town looked up this place & I was pretty excited to try somewhere new. Our waitress Maya was amazing, gave great recommendations & the service was fantastic. We started with the Brussel sprouts appetizer, oh my gosh, it was delicious. The bruschetta was good too but the Brussel sprouts just blew everything out of the water. I got the Burrata appetizer as my meal, the cheese was so fresh and delicious. My boyfriend got the tri tip French dip it was delicious as well. And the flatbread our friends got was also amazing. No complaints at all about this place. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just checked out this local spot and were really impressed, the food and service were amazing.  The staff was very friendly, inviting, and everyone had a smile on their face.  Both of our dishes were unique and  quite good.  Just a great all around dinner experience.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The Brussels Sprouts w/Bacon & Balsamic-- DELICIOUS! The crab cakes (all lump, very little filler) were yummy ! Pasta dish-- Gold Star and the Sea Bass was solid  Super friendly wait staff. Great experience visiting Scottsdale from San Francisco Bay Area."}
{"text":"I snagged a spot on the patio, and happened to make the last 10 minutes of Happy Hour by Happy Snaccident! Their HH is the Bomb.com! Do not miss the Grilled Cheese Board! I thought I had ordered a cheese board, but it is actually a board of grilled cheese sandwiches with the yummiest, tomatoey, sweet jammy goodness you will ever taste! If you're like me, and require ketchup or tomato soup with your grilled cheese sandwiches, you just might taste a little cheesy piece of Heaven!  I consider myself a bit of a grilled cheese and Mac and cheese connoisseur (I don't order either out very often), but this one is WORTH IT. I also ordered oysters, the HH slider, French Onion Soup, and Butterscotch Pecan Pie. Everything was fabulous, and my server, Taylor, was a sweetheart!"}
{"text":"Oh Happy Day! Finally a restaurant in this location everyone will love! Went for Sunday brunch, 100% loved it. Entire menu is well thought out and appealing. Bloody Mary aand Mimosa bar were fun. 5 different juices, loads of accoutrements for the bloody mary's. Shared bruschetta which was awesome. Had the eggs in purgatory and croque madame. Both were excellent. The hot sauce (\"Topher's Angry Sauce\") is amazing! Wound up buying one. Can't wait to try heir happy hour and dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Well when you go there on a Friday for happy hour. Two things to note:  two  oysters for three dollars although it's on the menu & on the website it's not on the table. First cocktail is supposed to be a mixture of beers and tequila and It was more ice and beer then tequila. And that's only halfway through the meal. Bruschetta tasted like the same cheese from my toes. ( No I don't eat toe jam cheese, that's just an analogy figurative speaking.)But the waitress was  spot on...very apologetic but I kept telling her it wasn't her fault she didn't make the cocktail and she sure didn't make the cheese. She just brought it to us that's why gave her at $10 tip. Food ok but I don't go back for ok."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place as we were trying to figure out where to go. What a delight!  Fun, energetic atmosphere. Great staff threat are smiling and attentive. Wine was scrumptious and the flatbread was quite yummy. For a change of atmosphere and great food - check this place out!"}
{"text":"Not my type of food. I guess if the menu is too your liking, I am sure the food is good. It was not our type of food."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. A friend told us how wonderful the brussel sprouts were.  Well, I don't like char so I passed on those but had a huge French dip sandwich on a fresh sesame roll and to die for spaghetti squash with butter and cheese. Brought half of everything home it was so big. My husband had the Chicken breast BLT with loaded smashed potatoes and enjoyed it very much. Our waitress Molly was great and the owner/chef greeted us and chatted at the table. An incredibly likable guy. We will be back after we check out his other places Grassroots and Wally's.  P.s.  Found out later my 87 yr old dad discovered Grassroots short ribs awhile ago and hadn't shared the find! Or I wasn't listening. Probably the latter."}
{"text":"Amazing food.. great service and excellent drinks!  I definitely recommend the salmon.  My group ordered one of each of the desserts and were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great choice for our Wedding Rehearsal Dinner!

Want to  give a Big thanks to Shea from Catering! Also David the Mgr was very nice 
and Jamie our cheerful, Attentive & Polite Server was delightful!

We were able to add some personal decorating touches beforehand which I was greatful for.

We had 21 people- and everyone seemed to be pleased with the ambiance (we flowed from the private dining room to the patio with fireplace)
and the food!

We pre chose appetisers 3 entre choices  2 deserts 3 wines, beers and mixed drinks!

The APPETIZERS came right out as guests arrived-delicious too I might add! Drinks were readily available thru the night.

All food served was Delicious!-we chose Salmon, a Chicken dish and a short ribs dish!

Both deserts yummy!

Check it out-book early!"}
{"text":"While on vacation in Scottsdale and yelping places to eat, we stumbled upon this wonderful restaurant. We started with their brussel sprouts in which both presentation and flavor were great. For entrée, I got their cobb salad which was full of fresh flavors. It was also topped with onion straws, which was a nice touch of crunch to this salad.  After eating our entrees, although we were full we had to try the hot cookies with a shot of chocolate milk. What a great dessert, yet again with wonderful presentation. The service was awesome. If we are ever in the area again we would be sure to make time to eat at this establishment again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant. Our party tried most everything on the menu and it was all delicious. I was especially fond of the flatbread. So good. My husband loved The Brussels sprouts and they way they served them in a glass jar was pretty clever too."}
{"text":"As a pregnant woman, it's already difficult enough to find something on a menu that sounds good to you when you have food aversions, restrictions, nausea and exhaustion and our waiter did not help at all. I just wanted to go out and catch up with a girlfriend at a casual, comfortable spot close to my office. I was able to walk there which was perfect and then as soon as we sat down i asked about the Cesar salad, to see if they make the dressing with raw egg. He insisted there is no egg in the dressing, he didn't even have to ask, so we said great give us a minute. About 10 minutes later he finally comes back to our table and says that in fact yes there is egg in the dressing. At that point, i was frustrated it took him so long to come back to us for our order and now just plain annoyed. I asked if i could just get some grilled chicken breast and order a side or an appetizer with it and he said NO. He insisted they won't just put chicken breast on a plate for me but what i could do is order the chicken sandwich and then just get nothing on it or with it. that sandwich is $13.00 and he was completely serious in his suggestion. I explained to him that i'm pregnant and having one of those days where nothing sounds good to me, can he just work with me here so i can have something to eat but he insisted there was nothing he could do, I would have to order a full entire meal off of the menu.

So i ordered the chicken sandwich had a few bites and took the rest home to my husband. I should have asked for a manager, or if the waiter wanted to be helpful, he should have suggested that he would go ask his manager if he could accommodate my request. I was almost in tears because of how complicated ordering was (pregnant lady hormones and everything) and Twisted Grove seemed to care less. The menu does sound good if I was not pregnant but because of the service here, i'm not interested in giving it another shot, I'll stick to Grassroots, the service there is leaps and bounds above and menu has much more variety."}
{"text":"My first time here I rated this place 5 stars and said the following:They have great salads! I absolutely love their Cobb salad. It is my favorite!
My boyfriend also got the prime rib and it was delicious.
I highly recommend this place!

When I returned for a 2nd time, I lowered my rating to a 3. I again ordered the Cobb salad and found the salad dressing to taste like mayo. It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Twisted Grove and will come back next time we are in town!  Juliette was our waitress and provided us great recommendations.  Brussel Sprout App was amazing, flatbread(I've had better), and Nocchi and short ribs were good!  It's very filling and rich so get ready.  I had their cocktail polamo... switched to cakebread Sauvignon Blanc was very happy. 

YOU MUST GET DESSERT! We had the chocolate chip cookies and butterscotch pecan pie!  Out of this world and I'm looking to see if they can ship to Arkansas!  Overall I gave a three star due to the flatbread being so so and a tad cold.  My cocktail drink was just OK.  Our service, main dish and dessert were on point.  


We will come back because I would like to try their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"The hostess didn't know what she was doing.  The whole patio was empty as well as another section that was for catering?  One of the people in our group was scolded for looking down at the waiting list. We tried to talk to management but they didn't seem to care. At least one other group besides ours left because of the lack of service.  They are busy because it is new, they won't be in business for the long haul if they don't get their lack of service issue figured out."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Me and my boyfriend split the baked oysters for an appetizer, they were so good. I ordered the gnocchi and short rib dish and it was to die for! Great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"Wow, let's just talk about Twisted Grove for a moment. This is easily the best restaurant in the entire Scottsdale area. What makes it so great you ask? Impeccable service down to the tiniest detail, incredible food that makes you salivate at every bite, and an intense atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. Each and everyone of my needs were met, and one of the bussers (Peter) was very accommodating to my several tedious requests. Definitely get the Mushroom and Bourssin Flatbread, so good. Also, make sure you inquire about desserts - as they were fantastic. Just woah, I am utterly speechless."}
{"text":"Not the best place for a picky eater, but they do have a good selection of flatbreads! I tried the Capri say, but the mozzarella was soggy and in less you like mushy mozzarella stay away from that dish!"}
{"text":"I was meeting family visiting from out of town and wanted to find a place close to where they were staying so I entered their zip code and Twisted Grove was featured. I read a number of reviews and decided to meet there. The building is spacious and very warm.  Large booths and the staff was very friendly.  We started off with their build your own bloody mary. Several different types of olives to choose from and other items but had I tasted the bacon before I went back to the booth I would have cleaned out the jar.  It was amazing.  We asked the waitress her suggestions so she named several but when she said Crab Cakes she didn't need to say another word. All 4 of us ordered the crab cakes.  It's not lumb crab it's more shredded but it's all crab with just a little binding and a light coating. My cousin who is from NY said it was the best he's ever had. We were there visiting for two hours and never once did we feel rushed. If we are ever back in that neck of the woods we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Waiting at the car wash and decided to grab a late lunch somewhere new and fun.  Twisted Grove showed up on Yelp. Great lunch, got to watch college football.  I had the French dip, extremely tender meat and no gristle. My spouse had a delicious Cobb salad. A couple of craft beers and we're fat and sassy and happy."}
{"text":"Amazing food, wonderful atmosphere, friendly staff. We will be regulars here! I'm still eating, and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Twisted Root's sister restaurant Grassroots. The food, particularly the oysters, were very good but the interior seating was very noisy. Our server, Mathew, did an awesome job."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing little hidden treasure! Happy hour food is delicious and service was great! Grilled cheese and bruschetta boards were delish. If you live in the area or are looking for a new spot, check this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner and ordered the braised beef ribs. I was blown away at how tender and delicious they were, I was not expecting that! The jalapeno grits were also delicious and I don't even like spicy foods. Excellent service and I can't wait to come back for Mother's Day!!"}
{"text":"Wow. I said wow with every plate. Service: immaculate, frequent and fast. The servers knew the menu and their suggestions were spot on. The tres-leches dessert......astounding.
Everything was fantastic and haute couture..."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the carbonara and the frites fries. Both of them were delicious. The environment is such that it can be casual or fancy. Very friendly staff and timely service. If we ever come back to Phoenix we will be back"}
{"text":"Went there last night with friends. Loved it so much that bringing my family there today!  New hip restaurant - great atmosphere, delicious food & nice staff.  Crab cakes are delicious - no fillers all crab. Soba noodle salad amazing. My friend had the sea bass & not a morsel was left behind. Such reasonable prices too. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Worst birthday dinner. They wrote most of it off, but I'd have been happier paying my bill and getting properly served. The entire meal was dropped at the table at once! Management never even came out to address the issue; just my server. I wish I was writing a better review. I wish I had a better experience."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great bartenders, amazing cocktails, the cavatelli pasta with the brussels sprouts instead of peas is unbelievable, and the prices are totally reasonable. They could've charged a lot more for that pasta and for the cocktails. Definitely bringing back more friends and family!
Such a great change from what Stella tried to do and Central bistro. We live super close, and that corner has sadly disappointed us sense Zen32 was there years ago."}
{"text":"Their happy hour was great! We had a large party sitting in the bar during happy hour and the server was amazing to us! We have been other places with our large group and this by far was one of the best experiences we had. Our server was on top of everything and did not miss a beat. The prime rib sliders are excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"Once again the staff has made our visit great. A new item on the menu is a must. CHEESE CAKE. OMG. Robbie, Kayla, Shawn, and Emma were fantastic. Please try the Tuscan Pork Porterhouse. For a bar snack my favorite is the Angry Bird Flat Bread."}
{"text":"After dining here several times, I am definitely a fan of Twisted Grove.  The food is comforting, the cocktails are tasty, and the atmosphere is very inviting.  Here are a few of my recommendations:

Appetizers: they're known for their brussel sprouts (which are delicious), but I absolutely love their Spinach and Artichoke dip! The chips come covered with crema and fresno chilies, which give a nice kick to the already creamy, delicious spinach dip.

Main entree: Gnocchi and short ribs.  It's homey, creamy, and makes just makes you smile with enjoyment.

Cocktails: Fleur di Lis - it's a grapefruit basil cocktail with a splash of sparking rose.  It's so light and refreshing, that it's my go-to cocktail for any occasion.

If you're in the neighborhood, definitely come and check out Twisted Grove for some great food and fun drinks!"}
{"text":"Went the other night and was super excited till we got there. Turns out they have a late night menu. I can't tell you when this starts but the regular menu stops at some point. 

Our waiter seemed egged to get us out of there even though it was over an hour before close and only one other couple came in after us. The common theme seemed to be our waiter talking all of us out of food. Didn't work for any of us. 

We ordered four items to split. It was so bland and uneventful. Not what I expected after my wonderful experience at Grassroots.  That and our PC Principal twin I was quickly over it."}
{"text":"This place has phenomenal food. We went here for a date night and couldn't decide on the appetizers menu so we chose two! We ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts and the Bruschetta. Both were outstanding! The sprouts were cooked perfectly with bits of candied bacon and balsamic drizzled on each bite. They have many bruschetta options, you can choose three. The flavors were sweet and savory, and the bread was fresh and delicious underneath the toppings. For the main course we shared a delicious order of gnocchi and short ribs, in a rich creamy sauce. For dessert we shared a chocolate cheese cake, which we couldn't finish because we were so full from all of the food. Great date night, great food, great service!"}
{"text":"I started off with the summer style shandy. I'm not sure why I ordered it as I am not a big beer drinker. It was a good drink but a bit too tart for my liking. I moved on to the homegrown shandy which was also a bit too tart for my liking, I ended up sending it back as I wasn't going to drink it. Again, I do not blame this on the restaurant as much as my desire to try something new and different. They even left it off of the bill which I wasn't expecting at all since it was my fault for ordering it. I finally ordered something more in my wheel house and got the blueberry smash. This drink went down quickly, it was so GOOD! I highly recommend this light and summery drink.

As far as food goes we ordered the prime rib slider, grilled cheese board and the crispy fish tacos. We even strayed off of the happy hour to get their Brussels Sprouts as I am a huge fan of Brussels Sprouts. 

The grilled cheese with the spicy tomato jam was excellent. The jam is not spicy (as I am not a spice lover I was very happy about this). This was a simple grilled cheese but touched up with the great jam. Also, this portion was quite a bit bigger than we were expecting. There were only two of us and I would say we probably should've ordered once less dish due to this portion size. This would be a good appetizer for 3 or more people if you are going to order more than one appetizer.

I enjoyed the fish tacos the best. I really enjoyed the pickled slaw and lemon aioli. Well done here. 

The prime rib slider was a bit of a disappointment but we order too much food anyway so I wasn't disappointed to have less food to eat.   

Unfortunately, I was unimpressed with the Brussels Sprouts as I've had them much better at other restaurants. I will say, their presentation of the Brussels Sprouts was cool, though. 

Our server started out very personable and helpful but ended up neglecting us towards the end when we were looking for an additional drink. We ended up not ordering the drink. She was very helpful with our food choices in the beginning and she was very personable. 

I would visit here again and give it another shot."}
{"text":"We had my sister's birthday dinner here and everything we ordered was incredible! This is definitely a foodie's heaven with a menu featuring lots of aiolis, relishes, burrata and other cheeses, and other unique combinations/preparations/dishes. We started with the twisted noodle salad with steak and the charred brussels sprouts. Both highly recommended (especially the brussles - WOW). I am attaching photos of all the entrees we ordered, too - yum yum! The service was great, and for dessert we tried the ricotta with cherry sauce and I got a hot cocoa. We were happy customers and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The eggplant sandwich and steak noodle salad are both to die for!! You will not regret ordering and sharing these with a friend. Service was great at the bar and the open doors to the patio create a light and airy feel without being in the sun. Try this place out! Caitlin at the bar was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"I was looking for a happy hour place near me that ended at 6 pm instead of 5 pm. I found it! I went last week and Tammy was our waitress. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and had great energy. I recommend the Brussels sprouts and oysters, and the Angry bird flatbreat.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in last week for a nice early dinner.  The place has a nice open feel to it, but without being too noisy like some places get.

The sun was going down which was rather uncomfortable, but the hostess quickly noticed our squinting faces and lowered the blinds.  GREAT JOB!  You would be surprised how some people don't notice things like that...

The place already won my heart as I scanned the drink menu... Sazerac!  If you are a bourbon lover, and you haven't had one yet... you are missing out!  Any place that offers them, I'm all over it and Twisted Grove prepares a nice one!!

My wife ordered up the Arcadia Club and I went with the Angry Bird flatbread.  Both food items came out promptly and well prepared.  The club was a good sized sandwich and didn't fall apart.  The flatbread had a great texture from the dough and nice flavors.

Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant for the neighborhood.    Great atmosphere and a perfect place for all ages.  Nice patio and inside is very spacious.  Had the tri tip sandwich.  Was a little small but that's alright bc most places serve too much.   We will be back when we are on that side of town."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices and pours. Staff is quick and polite. Food is excellent. Crispy fish tacos are bomb."}
{"text":"One word, YUM. Order the Brussel Sprouts. Just do it. Really, just order anything on the menu and you will be happy. Excellent service. Kind people. Fabulous presentation. Great prices for the quality of the food! Excellent \"Twisted Hour\" deals (small plates, appetizers, and drinks). We go to Grassroots all the time, but this was the first time we went to Twisted Grove.. and it will definitely not be our last. It was perfect for our date night spot! We enjoyed the entire experience. Thank you for taking such good care of us and for providing us with the yummiest food with REAL and FRESH ingredients. If you are reading through Yelp reviews and you are still not sure about trying the restaurant, just go! You will not be disappointed. We sure weren't. Oh, and if you love bacon, you will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm.  Been a big fan of grass roots for a long time and live in the neighborhood. Walked in and so excited but the food menu left me leaving hungry and craving a meal.   Bummer is all I have to say.  Won't be back unless it is just for a drink...great bar."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight with the family. Menu wasn't too bad, it's not overly exciting but they had a special for Restaurant Week. As part of this they offered oysters. Three at the table ordered the oysters, my husband had an oyster that was quite literally rotten. He spat it straight out and it could be smelled from the plate on the table. He's now sick in the bathroom. Simply unacceptable. The rest of the meal was okay. Broccolini served with swordfish was stone cold, pasta was lacking flavor and gluggy. Pork chop was very nicely prepared. Service was friendly but drinks from bar were super slow even though it wasn't a busy Saturday night. Given my husband was quite literally poisoned, we won't ever be back and I will be warning others of our experience."}
{"text":"After checking into my hotel nearby, I was ready to get some food in my belly and call it an early night, so I headed over to Twisted Root around 5pm.  Made my way to the bar and grabbed an empty seat, and was immediately greeted by Lindsey and given food and cocktail menus.  I'm a sucker for shishito peppers, and they were on the happy hour menu.  I also got the Angry Bird flatbread with extra chicken.  The peppers were perfectly charred with a toasted coconut topping,  and the flatbread was really delicious as well.  The atmosphere seemed fun and the entire menu was very diverse."}
{"text":"Came here for a super late lunch. At first looking at the menu I was skeptical because I'm not that familiar with this type of food. 

Ended up ordering the bruschetta board - prosciutto, avocado, and candied bacon as my three choices. The avocado bruschetta was wonderful! I definitely would order that again. 

Definitely coming back to try something else in the menu"}
{"text":"Great food,  good atmosphere. 
I'll start with the atmosphere. Inside is very loud and lively, we chose to sit outside because we weren't feeling the loudness that particular evening. BTW, the restaurants interior is very well put together. Patio has misters and shade screens to block the sun. It was hot (what you would expect summer to feel like) but with the shade and misters it made the patio feel nice and comfortable, but probably to hot for some, you know who you are. 
The food looked and smelled fantastic. We were not in the mood for meat that evening so we ordered all vegetarian dishes. They had enough to feed a table of four. Needless to say, everything we ordered was delicious which made us not even miss the meat. 
I would definitely go back with my significant other or as a group. The atmosphere seemed fun and a good place to have some drinks with your mates. I would give it five stars but I've only been there once and I think it takes a few times to really know a place, so who knows, maybe next time my rating will change."}
{"text":"Went with a girlfriend for lunch - originally had planned to go to their sister restaurant in the same shopping area but it was packed. Thought we'd try this.

SO glad we did. I loved the options on the menu, my friend had been before and said that she'd had the crabcakes and they were supper yummy. This time she had a salad and I had the angry chicken flat bread. We were both quite happy with our meal!

The staff is friendly and great about coming back and refilling the water/soda. I definitely plan on going back again when I have a little more time. So many yummy sounding things on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I'm not normally one to leave reviews, but this was one of the better restaurants I've ever tried in Scottsdale. After reading the reviews I tried the Brussel sprouts, and while I'm usually not a fan I have to say that I did enjoy these. Overall a great experience and our waitress Juliet was very good at taking care of us. Excited to come back next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We've visited Twisted Grove a few times and found that consistently the drinks are good, bar service just adequate and food just good. Something that is also consistent is that we never are told about any off menu items.  Parties around us are told about these off menu items however for some reason we are never made aware of these tasty dishes.  Not sure what qualifies a party to be appraised of specials but I guess we don't rank.  Once or twice this can be overlooked but tonight several groups around us were made aware of specials but we were not."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Wow, I don't have 1 bad thing to say about it. Great service, great drinks, and awesome food. We came during happy hour on a Monday and sat on the patio. 

We got cocktails, the bruschetta board & the crispy fish tacos. For the bruschetta board, we got the burrata, avocado & goat cheese. Our favorite was definitely the avocado bruschetta, it was bursting with flavor and extremely tasty. Each piece of bruschetta is cut into 3 large pieces, so you're getting a lot out of each kind. The bread was toasted perfectly and was crispy & soft at the same time. Perfectly done. 

Really looking forward to returning here for dinner in the future, it's a great new addition to the Scottsdale dining scene!"}
{"text":"The chicken with mash potatoes is wonderful as the contrast with the stuffing makes for a hearty meal. My wife had the French dip and is somewhat of an expert when it comes to these sandwiches, she gave the dip a B+."}
{"text":"We really like this place! Enjoy lunch with the great menu with some great food! I really like the brunch on the weekends! The Eggs in purgatory are amazing! Last weekend I had the Beef short rib hash,it was awesome. I love the bread you serve with everything. We really enjoy the flatbread also! We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and my experience has always been phenomenal... until today. 

My husband and I joined my best friend and her boyfriend for her birthday dinner this evening. We has reservations for 4 people for 7pm and we requested a booth. We arrived in and had to stand in line at the hostess stand, it was what appeared to be a busy night but that was no alarm to me since I've always had stand up service every time I've been here. When we reached the hostess we provided our reservation name and kindly reminded them that we requested a booth. We were quickly directed to the booth immediately behind the noisy hostess stand where we could hear every guest checking in (remember the long line I mentioned?) as well as the ringing phone and coworkers conversing among one another. Not really how you would want to spend your birthday, right? We promptly requested a booth farther away, plenty were open, but the young lady seating us seemed annoyed.

We were greeted by our server, Heidi, shortly after sitting. She asked us if we were ready to order drinks. My husband ordered a bud light however, the rest of us were too busy catching up to browse the drink menu. Heidi recommended getting waters for us while we were looking; fair enough but, that was the only time our water glasses were filled during the 2 hours we were at dinner. She returned with waters at which point we ordered our drinks and my friend ordered and appetizer for her and her boyfriend to share. Being that we had 4 guests, we were never asked how we were splitting the tab up front. We went on to order our meals and continued on with our dinner. Towards the end of our meal, my friends boyfriend asked if there was anything special they could do for birthdays; most places you can get a bowl of ice cream or a slice of cake for the birthday boy or girl to enjoy. Heidi went through a few options and I reminded my best friend of how much she loved the tres leches cake. Heidi responded with \"we can do that with a candle\". The way this was presented to us was that this was a special birthday treat that the establishment did for customers celebrating birthdays.

My friends birthday cake was delivered with a single candle and no plates or silverware (which had all be collected from us) to eat with. A few moments after my friend blew out her candle, a hostess dropped off a single check.... for the 4 of us. We placed two cards with our check, and told Heidi several times that we wanted to pay for our meal per couple. It took a few times telling her that we did not want to \"split the check down the middle\" for her to get it but she finally did and sped off. Heidi quickly returned to ask who's card was who's and then dropped off our checks. My husband and I received and itemized receipt with our check however my friends boyfriend who was of course picking up with birthday girls tab received nothing but a merchant receipt to add a tip to and sign. The food here was delicious but pricey so like any normal person, he wanted to be sure he was being charged appropriately so, he went to ask the hostess since Heidi was no where to be found. I watched the hostess follow my friend back to our booth and roll her eyes at him when he turned his back for asking for an itemized receipt. Seriously???

When my friends itemized check arrived we quickly learned that the tres leche birthday \"treat\" we asked for was charged to us and our cards were swapped after clarifying who to charge for what to Heidi. So frustrating. We were so shocked and upset about the lack of service we received not only from Heidi but from the whole staff this evening we just left; disappointed. 

My friends and I come to Twisted Grove regularly and highly recommend it to everyone but unfortunately after tonight.. we will think twice about celebrating life events in this establishment."}
{"text":"Can't begin to describe how great of an experience we had here. 
My fiancé and I ordered food to go but sat at the bar for 15 mins while we waited. The bartender was amazing (I really wished I remembered his name ). He recommended us great food, gave an honest wait time for our food and even chatted with us for a bit. Overall, excellent service. 
As far as the food is concerned, wow. It was amazing. I highly recommend the bruschetta, it's a bit different but the flavors are excellent. 
I've only been here once but once is enough to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Wow the gnocchi with the short ribs is amazing! Boyfriend and I went in this past Saturday. Although there were several empty tables that never got seated the entire time we were there we were told it would be 30 minuets wait for a table so we sat at the bar. The bartender was attentive but not very friendly. By that I mean she didn't smile or seem genuinely interested in giving us service we would rave about, she seemed content doing the bare minimum and was often occupied with what looking like closing and bar sticking duties. Her distraction cost her a few bucks because half way through our meal if she would have noticed our drinks had been empty for a while we would have ordered a second round but she never asked. The cocktails are really good. I like the flur de leis and my boyfriend enjoyed his martini. Bruschetta board was mediocre and the toast crust was inedible. The crab cake salad was yummy but over priced for the 6 lettuce leafs and tiny cake in an over sized bowl. I would go back for the short rib gnocchi but it will be a while!"}
{"text":"Good Food, good service. Pretty consistent every time I visit. Try the twisted oysters! So good!"}
{"text":"got an order of 4 bad oysters.  rather, 1 was clearly bad and 1 was iffy.  the bad one was black and mushy.  we sent it back and the bartender/server was happy to replace it with 4 new oysters.  again, the meat was grey/black, and smelled fishy.  i tasted one and spit it out.

the manager came out and said the tags on the oysters were ok and that they tasted fine to him.  he basically made it sound like it was a matter of our taste and not a matter of bad oysters.  he just asked \"what didn't you like about them\".  i had to explain that i didnt like black rotting oyster meat.  i work in the industry and am a certified food safety manager.  this place had a serious problem and failed to properly address it.

the service staff was friendly, but the manager was really unapologetic about serving bad oysters.  we definitely got the impression that they were going to continue serving them.  definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yes Mam! Gotta have the Brussels sprouts! Even if you didn't like them before, this will change your perception. Candied bacon and roasted garlic in a balsamic reduction will do that! Twisted oysters a fabulous accompaniment. Crab cakes and the Twisted salad couldn't have been any better. Joseph our waiter was fab. Great evening!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and never disappoints. Happy hour has some good choices. I particularly like the fish sandwich (crispy grouper)but all the choices are good. My wife likes the swordfish and the spaghetti squash. We've had most of the items and are all fab. I also enjoy the stout to wash it all down with!"}
{"text":"We just came back from dinner with friends, and we had a terrific time and an excellent meal. We split the spinach and chips between the 4 of us - perfect amount for 4; the dip was creamy and warm and paired perfectly with the chips sprinkled with peppers. Our friends split a Caesar salad, which they both agreed was great. We split the spinach and bacon salad, which was very light with I believe pickled onions on top.  The entrees were also good - French dip sandwiches, gnocchi and short ribs. I had the prime rib, which I really enjoyed - I rarely eat beef, but this was worth breaking my usual patterns. And then desert.  OMG!! Chocolate chip,cookies with chocolate milk to dip in - gives Mom a run for the money. And chocolate cheese cake, the likes of which I've never eaten before. Obscenely yummy. The service was perfect - Taylor was very helpful, obviously very proud of where she worked, and picked up right away on our sarcasm and dished it right back at us - she was delightful. Cant wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out this weekend and was pretty much a fan.  Pros:  the bruschetta sampler (try the avocado one, its amazing!), the mushroom pasta entree and the drinks.  The server we had was pretty good, however because they were busy, he didn't check up on us enough.  I also was a little irked that he said he would bring us out a complimentary appetizer (queso fundido) and then charged us for it.  Bottom line: I'd like to go again to try other dishes and order the avocado bruschetta and mushroom pasta again.  

Oh the roasted cauliflower side & parmesan fries are also really good."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Monday night and waited about 10 minutes for a table but Twisted Grove really wowed us with the food.  We started with the Brussels and I wish they had been cut into smaller pieces (some of the halves were HUGE!), they were still plenty flavorful.  As for dinner, I ordered the Crab Cake & Greens and maybe you shouldn't be ordering seafood in the middle of the desert, but the dish was amazing!  It tasted so fresh and paired perfectly with the remoulade underneath.  Everyone else seemed please with their food as well."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. Once for brunch and once for dinner. We LOVE it. Great vibe and the food is delicious. When we went for dinner it was for a friends birthday. There were eight of us and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food. The Brussels sprouts are amazing. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Both times I have been here I have experienced fabulous meals. The appetizer of the Brussels sprouts was plated in such a fun way, and the candied bacon that accompanied it? Heaven. I ordered the same entrée consecutive times: the Beef Short Ribs and Gnocchi with the lemon buerre blanc. It is bliss, it melts in your mouth, the pan seared Gnocchi is soft and crunchy at the same time. The buttery sauce accompanies the beef's au jus so well. The chocolate and cherry cheesecake was so rich and smooth. My favorite place by far. 
The service my boyfriend and I experienced so far was also wonderful. I can't remember the first server's name, but Amber was our server the other day. She had a great attitude and was very helpful and friendly. My only complaint is at the very end of the meal she announced how much the bill was for, which displeased my boyfriend who has traditional values in that the lady shouldn't have to worry how much the meal cost. She was also very eager to get the final check back and asked for my boyfriend to hand it to her after the tip had been accounted for. Her service was great, but just those things I think the business should be mindful of."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday last week with family and it was delicious. I ordered the rotisserie chicken with loaded smashed potatoes and it was enough food for about three meals! I also tried their strawberry Bellini which was sweet and super yummy. They also kept my birthday cake in the back while we ate dinner and cut it into pieces for us and brought it out. The service was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Joseph and Tony, the bartenders, if I remember their names right. Both these guys made it a fun evening for me and my buddy. We just decided to sit at the bar and have a couple of drinks but ended up staying there talking to these guys until the end of happy hour. The service was fantastic and the cheese and bruschetta boards were flawless and complimented well with scotch. Wow! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love grassroots,  so decided to try out twisted grove. Was disappointed to say the least.  Started with brussel sprouts, and they were delicious.  Others at my table complained they were burnt,  but I thought they were just crispy enough. 

Main courses  were marginal at best.  Wife ordered the short ribs and gnocchi. Gnocchi was good,  but short ribs were lacking flavor. I had the roasted chicken with stuffing and grits. Stuffing was delicious,  but chicken left a lot to be desired.  Portion was very healthy,  but one piece of the chichen was extremely dry. This was not a one off as another person at the table ordered the chicken and had the same problem.  He also ordered a side grilled cheese sandwich at the servers recommendation,  which he prompted was the best part of his meal (@$3). His wife had the crab cakes, and as other reviewers have said,  were delicious (disclaimer: I didn't try) -and these were one of the most expensive dishes at $29. My dining companion did mention to the server that the chicken was dry and didn't eat it and the server responded \"did you want me to tell someone about it? \", to which my companion responded \"I just thought that you should know\". And for full disclosure,  I did eat all of my chicken as I was starving,  and I don't typically complain unless the food was atrocious.  In this case,  just not good.

It would have been nice to at least get a manager table touch,  or been offered an apology for our mediocre meals. Considering we spent around $200 last night on dinner (with booze), you'd think the manager would at least come check on the table. 

Dissappointing. From now on,  we'll stick to grassroots."}
{"text":"Really big fan!! Quick and attentive service, good Happy Hour menu and regular menu, and a great ambience with plenty of TVs for sports without losing the intimate feeling. My glass was never empty before the wait staff was all over it. I ordered shushito peppers $6 and the grilled cheese app $5 and had a couple glass of Sauvignon Blanc $7 each. The peppers were incredible- not too spicy at all and had a nice sauce with coconut threaded throughout. And the grilled cheese is awesome- almost better than momma makes!! And very filling- enough for 2 in my opinion and is served with a tomato sauce on the side. Look forward to my next visit! WOW- had to do an update... my server came back after my meal with cookies and chocolate milk on her because I was her nicest table today.. how freaking cool is that?!? Took my review from 4 to 5 stars!!! This is the kind of place I want to be a regular at."}
{"text":"Flew in from San Diego heading to Sedona and decided to grab some lunch.  Searched on yelp and found this nugget! So happy we stopped to have lunch here.  Service great and food fabulous and memorable! Brussel sprouts the best I have had and the avocado bruschetta amazing.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Our group of 8 tried many plates and didn't find any that we found as average. They were all way above average. I strongly recommend and think that everything on the menu is amazing! The service was amazing and John (our server) was great with his recommendations. 5 STAR!!!"}
{"text":"I love this establishment!  We had our daughter's rehearsal dinner, making use of the lovely banquet room in the back of the restaurant and it was so very special.  We started with proscuitto wrapped asparagus drizzled with a touch of maple, luscious sausage and margarita flatbreads and an assortment of wines and cocktails on the back patio for starters.  It was followed by your choice of  baby back ribs, ahi tuna  salad and a rotisserie chicken entree.  The meal was toppled off with a chocolate brownies and ice cream and Tres Les Leches..  The back room is hooked up with a large screen to exhibit photos or movies to reminisce one's childhood and dating memories, so as to share with your guests.  The service was top notch and the owner, Chris Collins was there to oversee the celebration and to offer added service if needed. Very warm and an intimate atmosphere for a small group gathering......Thanks to the entire staff for creating a lovely memory for our entire family............K"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time, perfect excuse, AZ Restaurant Week. After reviewing the special menu, it looked very promising. I made an Opentable dinner reservation for 2 on a Saturday at 7:30. Upon arrival, having never been here, I noticed they have nice patio seating, big bar seating area and internal restaurant seating. We were seated at a table for 2 in the bar area next to a huge party group sitting at the high-tops. The noise was deafening. We asked to be moved further away. Future note to self: knowing they have more of an internal quite dining area I will note on my reservation next time to request the more quite area. Note: the restaurant was not filled at all. Shalorena our server introduced herself and was very good.

We ordered cocktails: the Twisted Martini, and the White Cosmo. Drinks were fantastic. We ordered from the AZ Restaurant Week menu, starting off with the Salmon Poke, \"Joker Bee\" Prime Rib, Crab Cake & Green, Butterscotch Pecan Pie and Chocolate Mousse Pie. The food was very good. I will definitely be back to try the regular menu and Happy hour.

Atmosphere: casual nice, Service: very good, Food: very good"}
{"text":"Spacious. Loved the hipsterish design. Ok service, bad music. Food was delicious. Bruschettas are good especially with prosciutto. We enjoyed sharing gnocchi with short ribs which melt in the mouth!  Spinach dip is a proper delicious dip bit greasy and creamy but you know what you ordering.. strawberry Bellini is just a perfect one so I am coming back for it and try their salad! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"For a newly opened place, it was very good.  The main room has a huge bar, which an get plenty noisy, but not too bad when we arrived.  I had asked for outdoor reservations, we waited a few minutes but not bad considering how busy they were.
They have a really large selection of draft beer,  wine not as much but OK for us.  The food was very good.  The flatbread was nice and chewy, toppings really flavorful.  The caulifower \"grits\" very tasty as well.  The blackened redfish was a tad or the dull side, as was my husband's fish sandwich.  If not for that, I would have given them 5 stars.
The service was pretty good, especially for a new place.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Wait staff were extremely friendly and made the experience fun and highly enjoyable. The food is very tasty, and everyone at the table was very happy with their meals! I had the gnocchi and short ribs and it was great! The short ribs were tender and the gnocchi homemade. And the best part... the tres leches :) it was soooooo good. Recommend to everybody!"}
{"text":"Yes to everything!

I had a good feeling our inaugural visit to Twisted Grove would be stellar, seeing as how Grassroots is one of our favorite haunts. We were not disappointed! 

We stopped in pretty early on Friday (5:45ish) and snagged one of the very last open tables available without a reservation. We weren't sat on the patio, but right next to one of the open doors so I got to pretend we were out there. Happy hour is available until 6:00 p.m., so we last-minute-snagged specialty priced bruschetta and I took advantage of their awesome HH wine special: ANY wine by the glass for $7! I had a glass of Predator \"Old Vine\" Zinfandel, which was a perfect accompaniment to my food.

Our bruschettas were the avocado/pickled onion/cilantro/jalapeno (2, since it sounded so good to both of us), and one of the goat cheese/dates/candied walnuts/honey. Both were outstanding. The bread was perfect and the toppings were fresh and worked so well together. The avocado's bread was SLATHERED in butter...or maybe it was very soft cheese? Or something. It was something that tasted delicious and unhealthy and I definitely did not care what the calorie count was.

For mains, I went with the mushroom & boursin cheese flatbread while my fiance had the tri tip sandwich with parmesan-garlic frittes. Word on the frittes: GET THEM. PARMESAN. GARLIC. YES. I devoured my flatbread. There was a moment with a few pieces left where I knew I could quit eating and be fine, but the garlicky spread of cheese and sauteed mushrooms topped arugula made me know feeling stuffed would be worth it. Tri tip was amazing/tender and like I said...those fries.

I lied, I did feel a twinge of remorse for cashing my whole flatbread, when I realized I was so full I wouldn't be able to sample the MONKEYBREAD for dessert. Pictures of that dish put Twisted Grove on our radar in the first place. But don't you worry, because now it is permanently on our \"regular\" rotation. Instant classic!"}
{"text":"Yes please! 
My whole Twisted experience was kicked up for the max due to the uh-mazing bartenders and of course the food:) We made reservations for a table and started off with drinks at the bar. The bar was so much fun, we decided to have our dinner there as well. 

Drinks were made with utmost care and precision, the food was just absolutely phenomenal, and did I mention the attentive but not overbearing bartenders? Come check this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Happened to come across this new restaurant. I got there around 130pm and was shown to a table right away. The service was excellent. 

I had an absolutely wonderful salad with noodles, avocado, mango, shrimp, and more. It was very unusual and I could have eaten a double-bowl of it!

My only complaint is that they don't have a website. I asked for and was given a card, but both the website and the phone number on it were not good. I know they just opened so I won't hold that against them, but they need to have an accurate Internet presence pretty soon. I eat lunch with several other people and was dying to show them the menu, but it's nowhere on-line ... yet. 

I will definitely go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Ambience and service were excellent, however; I truly cannot understand how their rating is so high, based on food. The brussels sprouts would be delicious but they were undercooked and made us um... uncomfortable inside. The short rib gnocchi was tasty, but in a deconstructed-beef-stew sort of way. Prettier than it was delicious. The carbonara is purportedly a staff favorite, but this tasted like overlooked little shells drowned in a flavorless sea of alfredo then (you guessed it) more undercooked Brussels sprouts scattered throughout. Overall tasted like a fancy Chili's. Not enthused."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here and there are many options for seating.  They have a private room as well for parties that looks really nice.  The decor is darling.  They have 2 patios and a great community table.  There are interesting cocktails and creative menu items.  I love the food here"}
{"text":"Had some amazing bruschetta.  The brussels sprouts were flavorful and well cooked.  They were very browned and well seasoned.  The Happy hour is really great as well with specials that are good prices for drinks.  I had picnic chicken on one of my visits it was fabulous.  I would like to come back again and try some more of the menu items."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the grouper sandwich and the fries were delicious!! The coleslaw on the grouper sandwich was so good - truly set it off. Also, my husband really liked his chicken sandwich with bacon."}
{"text":"First time here last night with the gf. We both shared the gnocchi and short ribs plate and the Angry Bird flatbread. Those short ribs will change your life! We both went cross-eyed with how good it was. The Flatbread was great as well. The \"Angry  Sauce\" they make is one of the better in-house hot sauces I've had to date. But those dang short ribs...literally had dreams last night about them. Will be back very soon..maybe tomorrow? Who knows."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great for kids too!  

We got the carbonara, burrata, parm garlic fries, cauliflower, and kids steak with broccolini and fruit.  

Burrata was served with really tender yet crisp heirloom tomatoes and the accompanying olive oil tasted fresh and good quality.  We thought it needed a little salt for our taste but not much.  More pasty ricotta inside than a smooth creamy liquid but was still good.

Cauliflower surpassed any expectations.  Wonderfully robust flavors that matched well.

Fries were pretty standard but lacked the strong garlic flavor that we love.

Carbonara was so good.  Having sampled some of the best carbonara recently in Rome I have high expectations and this came through ranked near the top with the Brussels sprout addition that was really great.  

However, the one thing that stuck out in my mind that was the best aspect of this place that usually gets overlooked even in the most upscale of dining is quality kids offerings!  The steak seemed like filet mignon it was so tender and velvety.  The side pairings were all good quality as well.  Very pleased.

Service was on par and very accommodating to custom changes to a couple of items we ordered.  

Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"The artichokes. Oh the artichokes. So flavorful. I didn't even know it was possible to have a flavorful artichoke. The menu and food quality really makes this a stand out choice. French onion soup with great depth of flavor. The place was busy and loud. It's got high ceilings and is open so noise caries. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Meh. Rather ordinary, a large room very empty on a Sunday night.  No energy in the place.  
Good burratta with heirloom tomatoes was the highlight of the meal.  Had to ask for bread.
Nice list of craft beers and  a wine list that is 100% American.  No stemmed wine glasses available.  I do not like drinking white wine In a stemless glass, it just reduces breakage for the restaurant.
Mains of crab cakes, grouper sandwich and a salad all about average.  No Siracha available.  
Coffee delivered with the message that it is coming out lukewarm today.  Might have been nice to be told before hand.
No reason to return with all the choices in the area."}
{"text":"Omg. I think I have found my new favorite place. 
I had no idea this gem was here! 
We arrived for lunch and our very friendly hostess sat us. What a nice relaxing vibe inside. 
Immediately we are welcomed by our server/bartender Sean. Friendly and professional. I noticed a nice little beverage card that you choose your LaCroix sparking water/ several refreshing flavors...plus choice of either Rum/Gin/Vodka...and garnish of choice. Yes please. 
Grapefruit/vodka/and grapefruit peel. 
Now to the food. Oh the appetizer choices... but we decided on the 3 Bruschetta. Honestly... one was better than the next. 
Then our lunch. Sean said the special today was 4 jumbo prawns breaded and flash fried with hot sauce plus 2 sides. I choice the slaw and tahini cauliflower. Delicious! Husband had the Grouper sandwich with slaw on it and fries. 
Oh so fresh and good. 
So full no dessert... but I can't wait to get back. 
Happy hour looks/sounds amazing! 
Oh and can I say how I love that the owner was there and was checking on his customers. 
This is a well run fantastic restaurant!! 
Thank you for a most enjoyable lunch. 
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"As my first time visit with my sister, who recommended Twisted Grove Parlor for lunch, I was very happy with everything. Great service, food and cocktails!
We tried many items, everything was spot on.  I recommend the Brussels Sprouts, Twisted Noodle Salad, Sea Bass, and the Tres Leches for dessert. Thank you Joseph and Maya!
This place would kill it in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  I'm an oyster fanatic and these are definitely quality. The prime rib sliders are amazing.  The drinks and ambiance are great.  Definitely check this place out. The bartenders were friendly and on point never felt neglected."}
{"text":"Good experience.  Bar staff is great.  Wait staff very nice -
The location is new and there are a delays, but worth going.:)"}
{"text":"The Biltmore area is only growing more competitive, but Twisted Grove is still raising the bar! It is for the most part a well-executed American menu, but it doesn't sacrifice quality despite having a gigantic menu. That alone is rare. 

I loved the appetizer I had: Artichoke Dip. The chips themselves are lightly coated with sour cream and slices of fresno peppers, so they're already delicious before gorging on the dip--which is covered in a mound of grated parmesan. They're so extra, and I love it! Their sandwiches are good as well. Try the roasted chicken BLT!

I also loved the fries. So much so I want to order all their side dishes for dinner (ex: spaghetti squash) and call it a day. I found the cocktails to be adequate as well--the sweet and spicy was rather mild but still had good flavor and better presentation. 

Only drawback is the flatbread was underwhelming. It didn't suck, but didn't but this town is full of great alternatives. So I'll keep focusing on the positive! I'll be back for dinner. I'll be back for happy hour. I am sold on this."}
{"text":"Twisted Grove is basically a brew pub without the brewery, meaning that instead of making their own beer they serve other people's micro brews.  Other than that is has the ambiance of a brew pub, the TV screens everywhere, and, unfortunately, the noise.

The food is good enough for that fifth star.  We tried the grouper sandwich (best fried fish sandwich I can remember) and an eggplant and burrata sandwich (almost as good).  The flatbreads are also special.  The fries were good but not great, but the other side dish - cauliflower grits - was special.

I'll be back - the menu is much better than most brew pubs and there are lots of things I want to try.

HINTS:
1.  It can be pretty crowded so get reservations if they will take them (not sure).
2.  Skip the monkey bread.
3.  If you don't like noise, see if you can get a more out-of-the-way table."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this is not a good review. They screwed up the order for two items and refused to take responsibility for it, I would not go there again even though I see they have a number of excellent reviews. Their food is generally good but there are very many restaurants with good food, rudeness from the general manager when complaining about their failure to perform correctly is not only uncalled for it is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this restaurant at all, and one starr is more than they deserve."}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday night dinner. The place is definitely on the fancier side, and the menu prices reflect that. That night, happy hour ran until 6 pm so we got there right on time at 5:55 pm. From the HH menu, we got the crispy fish tacos and picnic chicken. The tacos were ok; nothing to rave about. The picnic chicken was yummy! I'd get a full serving of this if they had it. From the regular menu, we also ordered the roasted chicken BLT (comes with a side of fries) and the twisted noodle salad. Both the BLT and the salad were a generous serving size and tasted great.

I'd come back here again for nicer occasions and try their drinks!"}
{"text":"This trendy eatery teeters nicely between upscale, modern American and classic, reliable American. 

With choices such as flatbreads, bruschetta boards, delicious salads, and more complete entrees, Twisted Grove has everything you could really want. Some of our favorites included the bruschetta board with goat cheese, burrata, and avocado along with the shishito peppers. As far as entrees, we loved the noodle salad and rotisserie chicken! Just be warned, the portions are pretty large! 

We personally were looking for a more low-key yet delicious restaurant, and this place delivered."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We had the oysters, bruschetta & brussel sprouts for appetizers. The bruschetta was my favorite. I hate pork chops & it was very good, my dad got that. My mom got the steak, she loved it. Our friend got the wild mushroom pappardelle & added chicken. He liked it but had to add a little salt. I got the cavetelli carbonara it was excellent but not served hot enough. All the sides we got were excellent but not served hot enough. We got the Ridge Three Valleys bottle of wine. It was excellent. The service was 5 star. Our server explained everything very well and she was very friendly."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE. If I could give 0 stars I totally would.  Lunch the day before Thanksgiving and the place was absolutely empty. It took the waitress over 10 minutes to come over to our table---what was she doing before?? We then placed our order...the appetizer of spinach artichoke dip arrived. After eating 5 chips, my friend realized there was a bug crawling out of the chips. GROSS. We told the waitress and she took away the food-- they did tell us they were going to comp which was nice. Then our main entrees arrived...the salads were ALLLLL WRONG. Both my friend and I have dietary restrictions which we went over with the waitress. The waitress sent over the manager and when we talked about the bug, his answer was \" well it's just a fruit fly\". WTF?!?! How is that an acceptable answer. Guess what it's not. We walked out of there and will never return. GROSS. DISGUSTED. NASTY."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but I have to say the food was pricy which is fine if it was worth the price.  I had the ceaser salad with shrimp.  The lettuce was wilted and the shrimp was cold and seemed like that cooked them earlier in the day and kept them in the fridge.  I also had the burrata, nothing exciting happening there.  My son had the club which seemed like a club you would get a Denny's.  There was an interesting smell when we entered but I got use to it after a while.  They had a great wine list and the prices on the wine was in line.   My bill was $75 which seems a lot for the quality of food. 

I will give them another chance because they just opened and they had some great option on the menu.  Maybe I just didn't order their popular items. 
More than likely I will go for drinks and maybe appetizers but not a full dinner."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! We came during happy hour and they had some great specials, including the bruschetta.  I highly recommend the goat cheese or avocado.

Everything else we ordered, from the flatbread to the gnocchi with short ribs was amazing!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely fuming after my experience in this restaurant. The first members of our party arrived at 7:00 for a 7:30 reservation. One arrived again at 7:15 and the rest by 7:30. By 8:10, we still were not seated at a table. We had to awkwardly stand around the bar just waiting until they put us somewhere. The staff continued to tell us that there was nothing they could do. We asked to speak to the manager and spoke to a young woman who again told us that they couldn't do anything to seat us despite our reservation time having come and gone.  

We had young children and a couple of elderly people, it was getting late, we were all hungry, and the staff was all but ignoring us save for the few times we asked them when they would seat us. They pointed out the table they were waiting on but said the manager would not allow them to offer to move the table to the bar and buy a round of drinks in order to free up the table we had reserved for our party. While it is certainly not best practice, one of the members of our party went and kindly told them that we were celebrating a family member's birthday, we had reserved a table and we had been there for awhile waiting. The group apologized and immediately started to gather their things and go. 

That was when a manager who had been absent up until this point came storming up to us and began to yell at our group in the middle of the restaurant. He sure didn't care that he had kept a large group with a reservation waiting, and he never made an attempt to come apologize or assure us we'd be taken care of as a good manager would, but boy was he happy to chew out a group of customers right there at the bar. After yelling at us he told us he could seat us. ??? What makes you think we're going to pay for food at your restaurant after you let us stand there with no food and nowhere to go for up to an hour and then proceeded to yell at us? 

For the record, we later spoke to the table we'd been waiting on and they had seen the manager yelling at us. They offered themselves to go back inside and speak to him because they did not feel that my party had done anything to warrant that and were shocked at his behavior."}
{"text":"Brussels Sprouts!!! Amazing! The food is great although there are a few dishes that fall flat for me the overall experience and food is still 5 Stars! Great drink and beer selection. So many fresh veggies and wonderful flavors! The service is excellent and the bar staff know how to make a drink. I think this place could become a favorite!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cute inside. From the low lighting, to the candle lite tables, and the \"take a book, leave a book\" shelf in the front. 

My brother and I shared the crab and avocado cocktail. It was light and refreshing appetizer. I wasn't a huge fan of it being served with saltine crackers, mainly because the only time one eats saltine crackers is when you are sick with soup. A nice sea salt and cracked pepper artisan crisp would be a more appealing pairing in my opinion. For dinner I had the crab cakes and my brother had the salmon. I tried some of his dish and it was good, but simple in taste. The crab cakes with the citrus aioli were good. The highlight of my entire meal was the cauliflower grits as my side. I definitely recommend those! I think for the food itself that we had, the pricing was very high a dish. The crab cake entree which I had with a coleslaw side and the cauliflower grits was $29 and to be honest I didn't feel that the meal justified the price of getting it again."}
{"text":"Omgosh. The short rib and gnocchi was amazing.y husband got the prime rib.  Both was the best dinner we have had in a while

Great prices too."}
{"text":"It's open, airy and on the loud side. I like the atmosphere - I like that it's got a bar, a section of booths, and then a dining room of tables. Lots of seating options. It will certainly accommodate large parties, because the dining room is quite large for a neighborhood restaurant. 

I like the food - the brisket is really good. And I like the happy hour menu. There are a decent amount of both food and drink options on the HH menu.

This isn't a place people dress high for, but I wouldn't wear casual shorts, either. Business casual is about right.

Unfortunately, every time I've ever eaten here, I've been overlooked or forgotten. The last time I visited, there were 3 people to serve me before my friends even arrived. I waited a while before I was offered water, and then nobody came soon thereafter to take my drink order (happy hour is on a time limit, after all!) Once someone did, it was a different person than who served the water, and yet different too from the person who took my food order."}
{"text":"We went last night with a group of 6 and had a great experience. Our server was very knowledgeable, friendly, and made some perfect recommendations. Every one of us enjoyed our entrees, but I think the Gnocchi with short ribs was the crowd favorite, with the prime rib not too far behind. The brussels and the shishito peppers were solid starters and the drinks were all wonderful. I would definitely come back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Finally...some place wonderful is in the Zen, Central Bistro, Stella spot. It may be too soon to give 5 stars, but I am going out on that limb. Food was wonderful, great cocktails, and welcoming from the moment we walked in the door. Will be back for again...most likely for brunch! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We just went for the first time and had excellent service and great food. The artichoke spinach dip is delicious. It's kid friendly and excellent food and a nice atmosphere. We will definitely be back there are so many good thing to try!"}
{"text":"Bruschetta is amazing!!!!!!!! We could of ordered a second one.  We also had crab cakes outstanding. It came with slaw and my husband never eats slaw until now. The blueberry smash is one of the best mojito drinks I've had. Staff is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed bar and quiet time with hubby. He is the most picky water ever and he liked it. Whew!!"}
{"text":"very good food, I had the eggplant stack and my wife had a flatbread.  Both way better than average, good flavor, good service.  Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, love going here when weather is nice to enjoy the open windows and craft food/cocktails. High quality ingredients and simply delicious. Will come here a lot. Order the strawberry Bellini, short rib and gnocchi. And and the Brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"We saw reviews on Yelp, and decided to try a new place.  The space is open and inviting.  It can be a little awkward near some of the posts between the bar and the long table space adjacent to the front door, but that's minor.

The drinks are really good!  I had the Sweet and Spicy, and the Collins.  Spicy drinks are often something only I like, but this one had a nice level of heat and overall balance that my wife enjoyed.  The Collins was a solid gin drink, and they use Hendricks, which is always a winner for me.

The food was outstanding!  We had the gnocchi and short ribs, and the crab cakes.  They make the gnocchi with ricotta instead of potatoes, and it is light, silky, and delicious.  The crab cakes were the best I've had outside of Maryland or Florida.  The portions look small, but I think it's due to the plates; we had leftovers of both meals.

Dessert was just as good.  Get the chocolate cheesecake, and the cookies and milk.  You'll never think about either the same way again.

It was so good, we came back with the kids the next day!"}
{"text":"Very impressed by both the service and the presentation.

Tried both the Charcuterie with prosciutto and one with Avocado. For a sandwich I tried the Arcadia Club, both fresh and well balanced mixture for a meal

Great bartender he really showed he knew the menu and flavor profiles well

Came at a busy time but still service was quick and friendly,

Would gladly go back, loved the interior work nice touch"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. My boss picked Twisted Grove for our holiday lunch and reserved the Board Room since there was roughly 20 of us. She also picked out a menu so there wasn't much picking for us to do other than our entree. 

All of us pretty much showed up at the same time so the hostesses didn't have to do much to direct us to the Board Room. We had a few waiters assigned to us who did a great job. Always came around with drink refills for us. Set out the appetizers within a few minutes of everyone settling in. 

My boss loves their Brussels sprouts so of course that was something we ate for appetizers. The presentation is a little weird (wood board and mason jar- so hipster), but the flavor is on point. Basically the BEST Brussels sprouts I've ever eaten! We also snacked on a few Burrata boards. Although I'm not a fan of tomatoes, these were seasoned enough that I even enjoyed them (but not as good as the mozzarella). The tomato spread for the flatbreads was a little too sweet for me and tasted similarly to ketchup. 

Our entree options were short ribs with gnocchi, chicken, and pork chops. All, we determined, were very filling and rich for a lunch, but delicious! I selected short ribs and enjoyed every bite. I couldn't eat everything because of how great it was. 

Following one of the greatest meals of my life was their cookies and milk for dessert. I forced myself to make room in my stomach for this epic cookie and semi-malted chocolate milk. If you think salt is disgusting with a cookie, think again."}
{"text":"We are so very excited for this place to be in our neighborhood.  1 minute walk when not 110 degrees...
Our server was wonderfully attentive.  Food was good, however, we literally went to try it out and weren't terribly hungry...We had the chicken cobb salad and it was really delish...I love a place that is not afraid to experiment with flavors..Loved the dates...very nice touch.  Also the hard boiled eggs were cooked perfectly...There is absolutely an art to that alone.
sunny cobb
romaine . roasted chicken . charred corn . pickled onion
bleu cheese . thick bacon . cherry tomatoes . cucumbers
dates . carrots . 7 minute egg . crispy onion strings
creamy vinaigrette . bleu cheese drizzle 14
I had the 
knickerbocker
four roses bourbon . sweet vermouth
bitters . drunken cherry

It was a nice cocktail...I'm not sure if they only offer the cocktails on the menu or not, as I had asked the server about this drink and I asked which drink was more like an Old Fashioned, and she simply sad that the Knickerbocker was good, but did not offer that they could make an Old Fashioned...It was good either way.

We will be back often...look forward to watching them grow"}
{"text":"This place rocks. The cocktails are fantastic, the service is excellent, and the food is just flat out amazing! 

Make sure you try the Brussels sprouts. Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of Brussels sprouts, but Twisted Grove somehow turned them into what I believe could be the best dish on the menu! They are presented beautifully as well!

This place is truly a gem!"}
{"text":"Not the happy hour it should be. I've had Arby's sandwiches that tasted better than this place's \"prime rib\" sliders. The bruschetta is bland and doesn't compare to Postinos. Their picnic chicken is dry nor crispy. This place does give me hope however, that I could open my own restaurant and get away with over charging sub par food. The two stars are for the atmosphere and well made adult beverage."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a weekday after attempting to go to lunch at Grassroots only to find that it was closed for remodeling. Found this place by accident and I'm happy that I did. I was dining alone so I took a seat at the bar. I was pleased to find the bat had purse hooks, small detail but much appreciated. I was promptly greeted by a friendly bartender. Ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and the portion was huge and the taste was delicious with bacon and roasted garlic cloves. Fun presentation as it was served on a wooden board with a tipped glass jar. So many tasty sounding dishes made it hard to decide on a meal but my bartender recommended the fried chicken sandwich with apple slaw on a brioche bun. It was the special so I gave it a try. I was not in the mood for french fries so he suggested substituting the tahini and grilled onion roasted cauliflower, what a great suggestion!  It was delicious and the cauliflower alone will bring me back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Meh. Decent brussel sprouts dish although it was greatly lacking in the flavor dept.

We also has 6 different kinds of their Bruchetta. The Avocado one was the only one that all 4 of us really had much positive to say about. For the most part they were fairly blah.

The fish tacos on Happy Hour were quite good.

The service was very slow and the order was messed up on the first round coming out. Had to be sent back.

We drove all the way from Chandler to try this place so that made it an extra bummer for us. Maybe they were having an off day."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for a work lunch and it was quite honestly the best food I have had in a long long time... Literally everything from the bruschetta to the Gnocchi & short ribs, then cookies were mouth watering and full of flavor. Gnocchi and Short ribs with grilled cheese is simply amazing. Cooked to perfection and so many flavored in every bite made this lunch fantastic. Bruschetta was cooked to perfection and also mouth watering. My friend has the crab cake entree and he too said it was fantastic. Prices seem pretty normal for this type of food, presentation and amount of food so I was extremely pleased. I will definitely be coming here again and recommend that if you haven't been yet you REALLY need to try it. 5 stars all the way and some!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and loved everything about it! From the decor to the food and service, it was everything I hoped for and then some. I recommend the twisted noodle salad. It comes with chicken or steak but I had no problem ordering it on the side since I am a vegetarian. My boyfriend split the salad with me and said the steak was great. 

Also, try the cauliflower grits. They are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is pretty great if you want a few fancified bar snacks. Oysters are hit and miss-grilled cheese-well, of course it's yummy! Who doesn't like a grilled cheese that you didn't have to make yourself?! Fish tacos, tri tip sliders yummy. For entrees the short rib and gnocchi is rich but tasty. We always share it. The knickerbocker cocktail is my favorite."}
{"text":"Came here almost by accident, our friends thought it was a different restaurant and only realized once we sat down! Amazing mistake though!! The ice cream soaked french toast was unbelievable. 3 of the 4 of us ordered it, and I got the grouper sandwich. Bloody mary bar was decadent, everything tasted wonderful and it was such a creative menu! Cant wait to go back and try more. I could literally order everything"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic meal! 

It's been awhile since I thought to myself, \"wow, this is really fantastic\". It's been even longer since I was super happy with the money spent for a meal out!

Twisted Grove, you've impressed. Joseph, our server, was fabulous. His recommendations were spot on, we all ordered from his list. And, his service was paramount. 

The gnocchi with short ribs, crab cake, twisted noodle salad & tres leches cake are all highly recommended!

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Super cute place, came for Book Club and they were accommodating for a large table.

Drinks; the Drink menu is yummy, everyone loved there special drinks. The Pinot Grigio was crisp and refreshing. 

Food; The grilled cheese Appetizer is tasty, but the Bruschetta Pizza/Flatbread was so perfect. 

Service; The service was a bit chaotic, both servers were super friendly but seemed confused on who what was doing what. 

Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, we'll definitely be back. Our compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"This was a little adventure while on a Work trip. The food was fine but not spectacular. I had the chicken BLT and fries. The chicken BLT was good but the fries were not that great-they weren't garlicky or Parmesan tasting enough. The place has a snobby feel to me from the staff and I didn't even feel comfortable enough to ask for ketchup. It is a relaxed atmosphere as far as dress a ambiance otherwise."}
{"text":"Another placeholder so my pictures link. I'll update with details later, but the 3 star rating holds true."}
{"text":"I had a french toast here for breakfast. The french toast wasn't a toast... it was deep fried instead. It was a little bit too much. The coffee tasted like water... 

I put 4 stars because the restaurant itself and my waitress were very nice. I'm not sure about other food!"}
{"text":"This place was so awesome! I had the Wild Mushroom Papperdelle and it was delicious! I want to go back and try the Short Rib Gnocchi which I was told was phenomenal! Their Chocolate Brownie Cheesecake was so so good too!!! Loved the atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"So far so awesome!  Friendly, professional staff.....great drinks.....really good food, love the menu........busy which is a sign unlike many other places lol.  Although there are many places that are busy simply because of the reputation and they don't deserve to be...especially because of the cost.  I AM the food original snob from Chicago........I HAVE owned AND operated restaurants, catering, banquets and a wedding coordinator, so please.....trust me!  Fun place with food and service worth every penny."}
{"text":"Enjoying a new spot I found on yelp! So good! For appetizers we ordered charred Brussels sprouts and 3 different bruschetta samples. For our main portions we had gnocchi and spare ribs in white Parm sauce and a crispy grouper sandwich! Always fun to try something new! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  We started with the Brussel Spout appetizer, to die for!  My wife had the Tri-Tip sandwich and I the Twisted Noodle w/steak salad.  Both were incredible!

We'll be back.  Only complainant, the noise.... We had to speak loudly to be heard. Only :-("}
{"text":"This was our first dining experience at the Twisted Grove Parlor + Bar.  The interior is very comfortable and the service staff deserves the highest marks.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the crab cake entree.  A perfect well-seasoned menu item guaranteed to please your taste buds.  Exceptional crab cakes with mostly lump crabmeat and little filler.  Don't miss having the chocolate cheesecake for a decadent dessert.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!. My wife and I always have a hard time finding a good restaurant because she is a vegetarian and I like meat. We both love this place and highly recommend it. After lunch you can go to Sweet provisions next-door and enjoy a delicious dessert.  I highly recommend the oyster appetizer and the bloody Mary bar on the weekends.  This is my new favorite restaurant by far."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. First time in but will head back for sure!"}
{"text":"We've been back in several times since my last review and still LOVE this place. We still have not had a meal that was less than delicious.The chef, David, is amazing. The staff is great, seem to treat each other like a family."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! One of my favorite places in town. Try the charred bacon brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"I simply adore this place! The atmosphere is warm and cozy for an open layout concept and the food is unique and tasty. So far Twisted Grove has been a great evening out with my hubby (minus our toddler, although it seems kid friendly) as well as for a lunch business meeting (not to loud and service was on point, both key for business meetings.) My only critique would be enhancing the Cobb salad, just needs a little more zest and/or chop to it. The bruschetta, on the other hand, was dynamite!!"}
{"text":"Five star food and five star service.
Short ribs with gnocchi truly wonderful!
Salmon outstanding.
Carbannaro wonderful"}
{"text":"Nice beer selection.  Reasonably priced wine list. 

Patio seating quieter than inside, able to happily accommodate our infant with a high chair.

Waiting staff friendly but seemed overwhelmed (forgot my beer refill).  

Brussels sprouts appetizer was delicious as well as gnocchi w short ribs.  Crab cakes were yummy and not full of filler.

Felt a bit rushed as they brought out next courses before we were finished eating the precious course.   

Overall good experience with delicious food but definitely felt the pressure of them wanting to minimize their turnaround time and get you out the door."}
{"text":"The NICEST people EVER!!!! My parents were regulars at Houstons for a long time, but this is their new favorite spot and it's easy to see why. Top quality eats (best Brussel sprouts ever.... those little garlic cloves...aannddd I'm salivating) and drinks alongside the friendliest, warmest staff ever. Twisted Grove is our go-to place. Don't change a thing. But maybe if you feel like it, one special vegan option would be bomb. Otherwise, I'll continue to customize, no problem. Looking forward to many more visits!! Xxoo"}
{"text":"My hubby and I enjoy sipping and supping @TGP.  Last night we indulged in their fabulous Happy Hour and were fortunate to have Maya as our server.  We always have excellent customer service here-and Maya raised the bar.  She ensured my glass of bubbly was chilled to my liking when the first one was a tad warm.  We enjoyed the Bruschetta, Pork Sliders and Fish Tacos-all savory delights.  We love the spacious comfy booths next to the bar to enjoy the energy of the bar patrons but dine in comfort.  A fun, hip vibe with plenty of seating and one of the best Happy Hours in town."}
{"text":"I came here to dinner with my friend. It was during the week, so it wasn't too busy and the wait wasn't too long for a table either. 

I ordered the gnocchi and short ribs. The short ribs were so tender and the sauce was very good. I thought the entree was very filling though and my friend felt the same way about hers. 

They also have really good cocktails here and the service was really good. They have a brunch menu as well as happy hour. I'd come back to try some other items!"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Sean was a fabulous server.  French Onion Soup was good , fried chicken - the best crispy, moist and delicious seasoning, Brussels sprouts are highly recommended and spicy margarita was yummy."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and happy hour and I'm a huge fan.  The staff is so kind and accommodating (even with a toddler) and the food is both very good and interesting.  I'm a huge fan of the caramel sauce shishito peppers and the Cobb salad is outstanding.  I hope this place makes it--the location hasn't been great for other places, but I think Twisted Grove is working hard to do everything right!"}
{"text":"So glad this place opened  up! They have a great atmosphere, service was a bit sporadic, but it was the first week it opened so I will give them the pass this time. The food and drinks were fantastic! WIll be making this a place we go to a lot."}
{"text":"Really delicious. Great service! My husband loved his short ribs and gnocchi. I had the crab cakes and was blown away by the amount of crab in them! One of my daughers had the pork chops and they were outstanding, as was the spaghetti squash that came with it. Finally, my oldest daughter had the pasta with meatballs and they were super flavorful and moist. Our server, Stacy, was exceptional and the wine selection was just perfect for us. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are ok to good here. We got that noodle salad and a nice cocktail. It was OK but not great. I know the people I was with really like it so maybe I need to order something different. For some reason, if I am there, I prefer Grassroots. I have heard they are brothers. I hope it is a friendly co-existence. :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with Twisted Grove. There are a lot of similar, modern American places in Scottsdale so it's hard to stand out through all the competition. While the food was pretty good - we tried a variety of appetizers and entrees - there wasn't anything that would make me come back in particular, and we also had a problem with bacon in the vegetarian plate. 

The vegetarian soba noodles had a random piece of bacon, when it's not part of the dish; and the Brussels sprouts also had a random piece of bacon mixed in, when we had explicitly asked for it without the bacon since we had vegetarians in our group. It seems like the kitchen doesn't do a very good job separating meat and vegetarian, unfortunately. Our server was also unfriendly - she seemed annoyed with our presence - but she did keep filling our water. We got mixed vibes from her. 

Overall, I wouldn't come back since I didn't love the food and the cocktails were kind of boring. However, one upside to this place is that it's very big, with plenty of space between tables, and seating for larger groups. If I had to plan something for work, without vegetarians, I might consider this place since it would get the job done, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Super crack 
Great reviews don't lie the reviews of this place it's like scripture hallelujah!

Meat cooked to perfection amazeballs!

Definitely stop by for some ridonkulius taste explosion 

Always coming back"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in due to such good ratings of the establishment. As usual, yelp reviewers are spot on. We shared the french onion soup as well as the grouper sandwich. Sooo good!  The soup was a tad salty but none the less very good.   The grouper sandwich was fresh, not greasy and the coleslaw ( an unusual twisted) on the sandwich was surprisingly delicious. The platter was served with  thin fries with a hit of rosemary.  Brittney our server and barmaid was awesome!  We're so happy we stopped in!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time during their brunch hours. My friend and I were both impressed with the quality of the food we ordered. I had a short rib hash with two really nice, round poached eggs. My friend got the \"Eggs in Purgatory,\" which is grilled cheese with short rib in a tomato soup/sauce with an egg on top. The sauce was delicious. They use fresh tomatoes to make it. We also liked the charred brussel sprouts with candied bacon. I even like the presentation of it spilling out of a jar on a wooden board. Plus, the patio was dog-friendly. Bonus! Just wish there were some umbrellas or something for the front and back patios. Anyway, look forward to trying dinner there."}
{"text":"I want to live here. Please come here and keep coming back so this place stays!!!

A friend and I checked it out for brunch following my bachelorette party and were in need of some good vibes and culinary healing! 

The build-your-own Bloody Mary bar is $9 and worth every drop. 

Eggs in Purgatory is a must (served with brisket AND a grilled cheese on the side) as are the French fries. 

The atmosphere was bright and modern with outdoor patios in the front and back of this chill corner spot. I know we have all endured a long hot summer here in AZ, so any chance you can enjoy some well-deserved patio time is a plus in my book! We chose to sit at the bar, however, to help up our hydration factor...; ) 

Everyone was friendly and attentive and I didn't see anything come out from the kitchen that I wouldn't immediately devour."}
{"text":"I really liked their appetizers!  They had a wide variety that could fit different dietary requirements (some in our group were low carb, no gluten, no dairy, etc.)  My favorites of the appetizers I tried were the ahi poke on tortilla chips, the bruschetta, and the broccolini.  I can't comment on the price, because this was a work event and I didn't pay so I wasn't paying attention to price.

During their HH it seems like they have a lot of drinks to choose from, but I just drank water.  Tip: there is a lot of parking IN BACK of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I had hosted a surprise birthday for my mom.  Shea with catering, was so helpful from start to finish.  We had the whole back patio to ourselves, which was beautiful.  There are 2 TV's outside, so was able to hook up a video and play for my mom via Apple TV, and Josh, the manager, was so nice, and spent about 40 minutes with me earlier in the day making it right.

We had a full bar, and the bartenders outside were great.  If you are thinking about hosting an event, the staff at Twisted Grove, really came through.  All the guests told me what a lovely time they had.  Thank you for helping my mom's day so special!"}
{"text":"Great service, great ambiance, good food. The prices are reasonable and they have a decent happy hour menu. We ordered the fish tacos on the happy hour menu. Those were goods. Sometimes, I wonder why tacos are so special and you know it's a good one when that morsel of a bite is a perfect balance of sweet, salty, and tangy. The other appetizer was the fried chicken. For main courses, we ordered the soba salad with beef. You have to add the beef for an additional cost but it was mucho worth it. The beef was flavorful and cooked to perfection. Lastly, we got the plate of veggie sides. For $16, you can choose from a list of veggies. I got broccollini, cauliflower, fries, and the spaghetti squash. All were good except for the squash because it tasted like I was eating a butter. Some may enjoy the excess butter but that's not my wheelhouse. 

Other details: our waitress was really nice. They have a private room for events and the food spending minimum is reasonable too. I'm happy that I went and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for lunch on Saturday and had a very nice time. Service was great the waitress and hostess were both friendly and welcoming and attentive. We shared the grilled artichoke which was very good. It was 1 and a half artichokes and was more than enough to share. We also shared the twisted noodle salad which was very good. It was spicier than I would have imagines but very tasty. We had it with shrimp and it had several large shrimp in the salad and it came in a large bowl so there was plenty to share. It was definitely a good choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Great addition to grassroots fam & alternative to fox, lgoNo!, etc. Chris & fam has done a great job in a short period of time & his Houston's background is quite evident!"}
{"text":"In from out of town.  We tried to get in at a nearby place, but it was full. We found this on Yelp and it sounded good.  Glad we stopped by. The food was VERY good. I had the grouper sandwich and my daughters had the chicken sandwich.  The bun was great. That might sound like an oddity, but trust me.  And the fries are great!  If I lived nearby, I'd visit often."}
{"text":"The people here are all incredibly nice, approachable, and attentive. Even though it's on the fancier side, there is nothing stuffy about Twisted Grove. My bartender Brittany made excellent drink recommendations and the food was incredible. I have never eaten Brussels sprouts so delicious in my life and the gnocchi and short rib is to die for. I don't know much about the rest of the menu because I can't bring myself to order anything else."}
{"text":"We stopped in here last night for a drink and loved it!  It was Sat night at 9:00 and not many people. Great cozy, neighborhood location. We'll definitely be back for dinner. We did try a delicious flatbread with goat cheese, chicken, and \"angry sauce\".  We sat at the bar, which is really open and you can see into the kitchen. The patio outside looks really nice, there's a fireplace and they allow dogs. Joseph our bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. I would call it sophisticated comfort food. The chef has creative ideas and I'll have a hard time deciding what to have when we go back. We also had the tres leches cake which was amazing!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with a couple of friends.

LOVED IT. Our bartender (chris) was amazing, super friendly, attentive and even changed my view on a turkey club! I was indecisive about what to try and he made a recommendation to try their turkey Arcadia club. Let me tell you THE BEST turkey club  I have ever had. It reminded me of the lunchable , you know with  the cracker cheese and ham. Only It's like the adult version and sooooooo much better.

Overall the ambiance, service and food were just amazing! Will be returning!"}
{"text":"My family and I have dined here about five times in the last five months. Obviously if we keep coming back, the food and service are great! We live in the neighborhood and it's certainly one of the best newer restaurants in town. You will not be disappointed with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"The Brussels sprouts are amazing. Along with the side of cauliflower!  We had the porter house tenderloin ,just amazing. The pecan pie is to die for.  Staff is super friendly. Just watch your fork, or ask for another!"}
{"text":"absolutely amazing! do yourselves a favor and go to twisted grove now! we started with a bruschetta assortment, and then moved onto the cavatelli, short ribs, and twisted noodle salad. 

you know an establishment takes pride in their food when the presentation grabs your eye. bright colors, perfectly cooked beef, fresh pasta, fresh gnocchi, house made bacon, the works. pro tip...get the sunny side up egg on the cavatelli.

we finished the meal with the cookies (fresh baked) and chocolate milk (some concoction of chocolate yummyness). you have to get this! pro tip...don't let your 2.5 year old get a hold of the milk. it was gone in a matter of seconds

we had a fantastic server which made the meal even more enjoyable. 

note...they have an extensive beer and wine list which I appreciated. 

another note...they have a solid kids menu, but it's not printed. the server will list it off for you. we got the Mac n cheese, French fries, and veggies. it's served on a plate with separate compartments which is perfect for the kiddos.

can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is very very tasty the flavor pallets of all the foods as they put together are really good. The twisted noodle salad is excellent and the sweet provisions are awesome. Service is very attentive and the cocktails and Shandy selection is really good. No complaints really like this place you should try it"}
{"text":"The food , drinks, and service were great, but I am definitely not impressed by Chris Collins.  We were there tonight with a Meetup group.  I know they were not expecting the large crowd that came in, but the unprofessionalism that he exhibited was uncalled for.  The bar table tops were empty when we arrived and no one mentioned that they were reserved for groups coming in later. Should Chris have handled the situation like a professional restauranteur then people wouldn't have been so angry and pissed to leave without trying to get a table for dinner.   Not sure if I will come back.  If I do, I want to be sure that Chris isn't around to ruin the moment."}
{"text":"We popped in here for a little happy hour drink yesterday.  The ambiance is classy comfortable.  It was mainly a female crowd with two bartenders. The bartender was very attentive, but didn't overdo it.  The bar seating is a little strange with diner style seats, but they swivel so it works. We took advantage of their hh food menu and ordered a bruschetta board and chicken. It was delicious! And the wine pours were generous. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I had appys at their Camelback location, but this was my first time having a meal at this location.  We were lucky to have Natasha as our server.  I enjoyed her recommendations and she was on top of refilling waters and checking in with us. We had the brussel sprouts appy and it was superb-charred and served with pieces of bacon and garlic. Yum! I had the most delicious, decadent french onion soup -which really deserves 6 stars.   My dinner mate had the salmon salad with was very good and a nice size. I will be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere!  The charred brussels sprouts are a must!  Delicious!  Everyone's food was great.  Will be back!  Love this place."}
{"text":"Sadly we had less than a good experience.
Ordered the Halibut sandwich it was heavily fried.  The side of cauliflower was over salted and not edible.  The server replaced it.  Glass of Chardonnay was overpriced at $16 per glass.
My shrimp salad was good and the highlight of the meal.   $60 including a modest tip for bar a food lunch is overpriced."}
{"text":"To start off, I'm a big fan of Grass roots. 
To be honest, the remodel/decor felt cheap, almost half done and not fluid. Grassroots is so well done, this just didn't have the same feeling. The fooD as usual was incredible. We had the shrimp cocktail (so fresh), Cobb salad and gnocchi. Big fan of the Cobb salad and shrimp cocktail. The gnocchi had an odd overly sweet flavor that neither of us were a fan of. 
Service was impeccable as always. 

Overall, same food quality as grassroots, great service, cheaper decor. Will return."}
{"text":"Delicious! On a whim, the hubby and I decided to dine here on a Saturday evening. It was late when we arrived (9:30pm) and since they close at 10pm on Saturdays, we weren't sure if they would fit us in and serve us. Not only did they serve us, they did so with a smile and didn't rush us a bit. We had an awesome experience here! 

Food and service were both outstanding! I wasn't super hungry so I ordered the artichokes (soooo yummy and the sauce was splendid) and french onion soup (absolutely delish). My husband ordered the fried grouper sandwich and I wasn't so sure how it'd be when he ordered it. Grouper, hmmm?! I tried a bite and absolutely loved it! I also stole a bunch of his perfectly-fried-to perfection french fries that came served with his sandwich. 

One more thing I want to be sure to mention. Having worked in the restaurant industry for several years, I know firsthand that at the end of an evening, especially a busy weekend evening, often the kitchen, dining area, and restrooms can looked pretty filthy. On the way to the restroom, you actually pass a portion of the kitchen. I was impressed with how clean and orderly both the kitchen and the restrooms were even at the end of a busy night. Always makes me feel better when I see that a restaurant is clean! 

Before coming here, I had never heard of Common Ground Culinary, a local restaurant group that owns Twisted Grove Parlor along with several other restaurants. Now that I had such an awesome experience here, I can't wait to try some of their other spots!"}
{"text":"Funky, fun, and great ambience! Love this eclectic place...great vibes and amazing food and drinks."}
{"text":"We went here twice during our recent week stay in Scottsdale and we just loved it.  I want to go back again as there were dishes that past us by (French Dip sandwich) that looked great.  The most amazing thing I had was a brunch item called Eggs in Purgatory.  Unlike its name, it is heaven!  Good beer selection too."}
{"text":"Omg the tres leches cake...I would come here just for the cake...It has ruined all other desserts for me."}
