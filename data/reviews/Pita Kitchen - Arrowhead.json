{"text":"A friend of mine highly recommended Pita Kitchen so I gave it a shot last night.  My wife and I both ordered the chicken shawerma salad and my son ordered the beef shawerma sandwich.   The chicken shawerma was dry and didn't have any flavor.  Here's a quick tip, if  the chicken is down to almost nothing on the machine, order something else.  Same applies to the steak.  My son's sandwich hardly had any meat in it.    On a good note, the place is very clean. The employees are nice. The fries were crispy, just the way we like them. The Hummus and pita chips were very good."}
{"text":"We love this place!    We used to go to their location on McDowell but this one is closer to us.   Excellent Greek fries and chicken shawarma.  The food is always good here."}
{"text":"Pita kitchen is my go to mediterranean restaurant.   I lovEEEEE everything I've tried, and am so happy to have found this gem.   The jalape単o cilantro is the best, the Greek salad is perfection, portions are large, prices are good, restaurant is always clean, service is always amazing, and food is beyond delicious.   All around I highly recommend everyone trying this place, You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm sooo glad pita kitchen came out to arrowhead with there delicious food ! I have to stop bye there at least 2 time a week ! When I found out they where coming north I knew as soon as people would try it everyone would love it I'm glad you guys doing well out here ! I loved there Avondale location but glad they came out closer to my house"}
{"text":"The chicken kabob with hummus is always one of my favorites. Beautiful restaurant, great food and service. The food is better than Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"We happen to find the Pita Kitchen on our way out of town a month ago...then we realized this location open up right by our house and we are so excited!! We have been here every week! My favorite is the jalape単o hummus and the homemade pitas! So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place is to die for!!!! My husband and I love the food! I get the chicken schwarma with the garlic sauce and my husband gets the gyro pita. We are never disappointed! We call in our order and it's ready when we get there! Definitely a staple in our home!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I really appreciate their vegetarian options and their pita bread is super addicting"}
{"text":"LOVE THE FOOD! The service is great and it's always clean !    Prices are a tad high yet you dont get military discount unless your in uniform which anybody can fake! Need to be able to show current MILITARY ID."}
{"text":"We went for late afternoon munching , tried the Mediterranean sampler. Very yummy hummus,  baba ghanoush , and falafal . Pitas were so hot and soft straight from grill. They literally melted in mouth . Price is pocket friendly . Do try out this awesome pita place :) I am definitely visiting again"}
{"text":"This place is very good - great addition to the arrowhead area. I had the two meat entree plate with cilantro hummus. Very tasty.. the chicken kebab was full of flavor and the chicken shawarma was very tender. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I had purchased a Groupon and wanted to try it as the reviews were very good. We had an awesome experience this evening. The food was so flavorful. I had the eggplant gyro. It was outstanding. It was stuffed with a large quantity of vegetables that were seasoned well and cooked perfectly. We tried the Greek fries. OMG! You couldn't eat just one. My friend and I shared them because the portion was large. The blend of spices,feta, and dressing were great and didn't make the fries soggy.  I will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"To put it bluntly: it's a place with pretty good food for a steep price. It is a very traditional-ish sort of place so you have to eat the meat with your hands scooped up in a pita like a Persian, which some may like and some may not. The vegetables are very good quality and the meat and sauce were very good. For me - the style of eating I don't prefer even when I was raised this way, I prefer the alternative style of eating gyros kind of like a burrito. Moving on from the food and style of eating, it was a little steep for a price. 16 dollars for a plate of maybe 800 calories serving - in my opinion a little too much for what you get. Service cannot be rated considering it is not sit down resteraunt establishment but is like a fast food place (not in a negative way)  3/5 rating - pretty good food but small servings and big price"}
{"text":"They are very accommodating with special requests. Ordered grilled salmon with only veggies. Those veggies are super tasty!  Also tried the eggplant pita with marinara. Would totally get it again"}
{"text":"this is a new place that is definitely worth a visit. the gyro pita was very good.  the pita chips and hummus was also delicious."}
{"text":"This was our third or fourth visit. We ate the Chicken Shawarma pita and the Gyros pita. Very tasty, as always. We recommend this quick and inexpensive Mediterranean eatery."}
{"text":"So good!  Chicken Kabobs were delicious.  Side salad was full of cucumbers, tomatoes and big chunks of feta!  Service was great.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our family frequently patronized another Greek restaurant that is fantastic (and farther away) and thought we would never find an equivalent until now.  Pita Kitchen has excellent food from their shwarma to their cilantro jalepeno hummus.  To top it off, unlike most Greek restaurants that give you a pita out of a bag, they make you one fresh to order in their pita oven.  The staff are really friendly and the environment from the decor to the music is very inviting.  We love good family- owned restaurants and this is a great one!"}
{"text":"Pita Kitchen is really amazing good! I love the Quesadilla!! They are the best! The frys are to die for!! I really love going here for dinner"}
{"text":"Love the Eggplant pita. Adding chicken for $2 is a nice addition. The veggies are fresh and plentiful. I'm addicted. Its a nice to have a place on this side of town that has high quality, fresh, healthy options. There service is always good too. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is a great, easy meal. You order at the counter and find a seat yourself. The service is fairly quick and the atmosphere is laid back.  We always order the falafel or gyro pitas and both are consistently good. My only suggestion is to order extra sauce on the side because there is never quite enough!"}
{"text":"We love Pita Kitchen! We order at least once a week! They have great jalape単o cilantro hummus with chicken! Great gyros specials on Monday and Tuesday! The Greek salad is delicious!"}
{"text":"Good sized portions and good pricing. They also frequently send coupons out in the mail to the local neighborhoods."}
{"text":"On my way to the Arrowhead mall with my family, we decided to try out a new joint we've heard so much about. Pita Kitchen is too much hype for the atmosphere and price. Very rude, judgmental workers who seem to only care about their money. I felt forced to give a tip i didn't feel the \"outstanding\" workers deserved and didn't get one smile out of any crew member. Highly recommend hiring new staff and creating better food options."}
{"text":"Why we waited so long to eat here is a mystery to me! Great menu, excellent prices! We started off with the beef egg roll. Huge order and so so tasty. I ordered the Greek salad (large) with gyro meat and my husband got the beef kabob (which is actually kafta) and the cilantro hummus with rice. Both were AMAZING! The flavor of the beef kabob was extraordinary...wonderful fire grilled that was out of this world. And to our surprise, a gargantuan pita, freshly baked, hot out of the pizza oven, the likes of which I've never seen. Imagine a pillow of warm and soft fired dough just waiting to scoop up the hummus. We were so impressed with this Mediterranean eatery, that when we have the craving for Greek food...this will be our only go to place to head to!"}
{"text":"Lunch here was awesome. Delicious Greek food at a great price.  I got the Gyro Dinner, it was a lot of food and everything was very tasty.  It will become a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"First visit at the Pita Kitchen for dinner.  Bought a coupon on the internet. This was by far the best meal I've had in a long time.  We waited for at least a half an hour because there were a huge amount of carry outs.  I noticed 3 chefs cooking behind the counter.  The Gyros entree came with thinly sliced beef & lamb w/rice, warm pita bread, taziki sauce and choice of Greek salad or hummus for $10.99. The Salmon entree was served with rice, warm pita bread, tasty garlic sauce and a delicious grilled vegetable medley of red onions, red & yellow peppers, Italian squash, carrots, & green beans for $13.99.  Portions were large and food was great! The Salmon was cooked perfect and the portion was nice size.  If you take the 101 East and exit on 67th go LEFT! Its located in a shopping center behind McDonald's, turn right. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The chicken kabob plate was great! Nice suggestion from the cook! The cilantro jalape単o hummus also very good.  I'll go back next time I'm in Glendale."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great, haven't ordered anything I haven't loved. Service is excellent. Local favorite!"}
{"text":"Yummy, I've only tried their steak shawarma so far and was greatly pleased :) I am sure the rest of their food is delicious as well. If you're looking for good mediterranean food, stop by you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant inspired me to setup a Yelp account. Why? Because I was so impressed by A. The look and feel of the restaurant is clean, casual, yet nice styling. B. The employees were overly courteous, from the order taking to food delivery.  But the main reason is C. The food was straight up delicious. The chicken was tender and seemed nicely seasoned. The many flavors were above and beyond the routine Greek food joint. This place is a gem, so I needed to create an account to not only share my opinion, but say thank you for the wonderful experience.  I'll be back...and I live in South Chandler. Came across by luck, really. So glad that I did."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The chicken schwarma, hummus, pitas and even salad are so tasty. That's what I order there so can't talk about the rest of the menu, but if they are anything like these items, you will be pleased. So affordable too. Service has always been with a smile and a helpful attitude."}
{"text":"It's been the third time having lunch at Pita Kitchen and the food has been constantly delicious. Service is prompt and the guys here have been always friendly. Besides the main courses I would recommend the hummus with cilantro and jalape単os! Yummy"}
{"text":"Amazing experience, the cashier recommended me his personal favorite and I was not let down, it was amazingly delicious. I am very happy with the service, food and the environment."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch to try this new place and we weren't disappointed. I am very picky on my Middle Eastern food and this is the best one in the West Valley.  We ordered their Kurta plate. The meat had the right spices and the rice was delicious. The chicken plate had moist chicken and delicious rice with a yummy Greek salad. I tried the Tabuli which was as good as my home made. Highly recommend this place. I am thrilled that they opened in my neighborhood.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple Greek places in the area and this one is the best. Little secret: The fries are super good! Great service and fair prices."}
{"text":"Really tasty PK egg rolls and hummus to start and then we got the steak swarma  and the chipotle chicken swarma.Combine really good flavors with a nice atmosphere and friendly counter service means we will be back often."}
{"text":"We have eaten at the Pita Kitchen several times. The food is on point. There Pita Kitchen egg rolls are fantastic. I also enjoy there Salmon entree. They give you a nice piece of Salmon with grilled veggies and rice. My only gripe is when you have a party of 4 people they do not bring all the food out at once. Several of us had smaller orders of food that came out before my Salmon entree. I had to wait about 10 minutes after everyone was eating there food. They need better coordination of bringing the food out all together."}
{"text":"Went at dinner time and decided to take our food home instead of dine in. Waited a good 20 minutes for that, if not longer, while the frazzled kitchen staff filled phone-in take-out orders. Had a gyro sandwich and a gyro salad. The gyro meat was dry and over salty; the cucumbers on the salad were watery as were the greens. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!?!?!? They make their pita bread fresh!!!!!! Not much to review after seeing and eating that. . Their food is by far the best Mediterranean I've ever had here in Arizona. Dine here, you won't be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent - staff is polite & helpful.  Atmosphere is relaxing. We would recommend Pita Kitchen and will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Pita Kitchen is absolutely delicious! I had the combination with beef shawarma and chicken kabob. Both meats were juicy and tender. It came with rice and your choice of salad or hummus. I chose the hummus and it also didn't disappoint. The restaurant was clean and service was really good."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch for our first try here. In a single word....Excellent!!! We got a regular gyro pita, steak shawarma pita, dolmas and the Greek fries. Loved everything! The Greek fries especially were a delicious surprise! I thought they would be soggy and blah. To the contrary, they're crispy and flavorful. Loved them!!  Looking forward to returning and trying different items.  I highly recommend checking Pita Kitchen out. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, good service! Get the kabobs, much better meat. The Greek fries are one of the favorite things I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"I've been craving gyro meat and when I looked up places near me, this was the first one and I decided to give it a chance due to the good reviews. It did NOT disappoint, so delicious! I ordered the large Greek salad with gyro and it was huge. The biggest perk for me was the quality ; huge chunks of fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and feta cheese. The meat was perfectly cooked, full of flavor and thinly sliced. My favorite part was the pita bread, it was warm and soft...you could definitely tell it was freshly made. Overall, awesome Greek food and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!  I just tried this place and it was FANTASTIC!!! Greek fries-WONDERFUL Cilantro jalapeno hummus- YUM! GYRO - SO GOOD!  If you are in the area they are worth a try FOR SURE!  #PITAKITCHENGLENDALE"}
{"text":"Love this place MINUS the fact I was just told I couldn't use my 2$ off on a salad because not a pita or entree however my salad cost the same amount!!!!!! Not sure I'll be coming back. My staff comes here multiple time a week. Eh. Not cool. Don't have people sign up for these things then be so restrictive. :("}
{"text":"What an amazing little spot and place to eat. The food was extremely fresh, the service was fast and the food tasted excellent! The Greek fries are amazing and to die for-simply delicious! You have to get the Gyro egg rolls, they are out of this world!!  The staff was so pleasant to even offered us a military discount on our order. That was extremely nice and we are very grateful- thank you for supporting our military!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Pita place! The food is always fresh and customer service is always great! Sometimes you have to wait about 15 mins for a fresh kabob, but it's worth the wait! Love the sauce! Good on everything. Prices are reasonable, tons of parking and easy access shopping center right off 67th & 101 fwy. we have been here multiple times and even brought guests from out of town and they love it too!"}
{"text":"Went Here today because I was craving a chicken gyro. They did not have that on their menu so I ordered a steak shawarma. I also ordered a small Greek salad so that my total would be over $10 and I could use a coupon for $2 off. I ask the cashier if he had ever tried that ziki sauce on the steak shawarma  He said that he got the garlic sauce on it so I got that on the side. Service was pretty quick, I sat close to the door because I was parked in 5 minute parking. The steak had a sort of sweet taste and was pretty good, The salad was good."}
{"text":"Amazing food, most of the time. The portion sizes and food are very inconsistent. Additionally, their pita oven has been \"broken\" for about 3 months now and the pita they are using is generic. We have been told that they will no longer be making their tasty pita bread anymore, which makes no sense for a place literally called \"pita kitchen\"."}
{"text":"I ordered my food over the phone. They quoted 10-15 and it was fresh and ready to go at 13 min. The hummus is delicious and chicken perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"I gotta hand it to Reimun Shleimun & Rian Hanna for making superb usage of Yelp.  As restaurants go, they make use of Yelp better than almost any restaurant in the valley.  From Yelp discounts, to a Yelp rewards program, to extensive video montages detailing their story & business operation, this is a business that knows to reach its customers in the social media age.  Pretty much the only perk they don't offer through Yelp (at least not yet) is Yelp cash back.  The end product matters the most of course, but reaching out to the community is key.  Their Yelp presence was part of what got me in the door, but the positive Yelp reviews was the bulk of it.  On a Thursday at lunch, I took in their Arrowhead location.   You'll find Pita Kitchen's Arrowhead location on the northeast corner of 67th Avenue & the 101 freeway (three doors down from Safeway).  For those who have frequented the popular west valley Mediterranean spot Greek Wraps, the setup of Pita Kitchen's restaurant & menu will look somewhat familiar.  The menu tilts Greek but with some distinct Middle Eastern influences including a variety of kababs & basmati rice dishes.  There are large easy to read menus to glance as you come in the door & while you wait in line.  Like Greek Wraps you order up front & they bring it to your table.   This go around I was pressed for time so I got my food to go.  Upon looking over the menu I looked for items which Yelpers recommended & where I thought Pita Kitchen might stand out from the Greek Wraps & Pita Jungles of the world.  I started out with Pita Kitchen's signature Kitchen Egg Rolls (yup, egg rolls).  These rolls are filled with diced gyro meat, spinach, feta cheese, & veggies and come with a taziki dipping sauce.  I also got an order of their Greek Fries per Yelper's recommendations.  These fries are topped with feta cheese & served with an olive oil mix that you can either dip or drown your fries in.  And lastly, this is \"Pita\" Kitchen, so a pita was in order.  Not wanting an epic food coma in the afternoon, I grabbed a Falafel Pita.  Three big balls of falafel (deep fried garbanzo beans mixed with veggies & seasonings) served in a warm pita bread with onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, & Pita Kitchen's house sesame sauce.  Total cost for all the food including tax & with the 20% Yelp check in discount (remember this Yelpers!) came to $15.  In 5 minutes, I was served.   Let's start with the egg rolls.  Three egg rolls in all.  The rolls themselves were juicy & delicious with the perfect amount of crunch on the rolls & some great seasonings on the meat.  I gotta admit though that I wasn't really in love with their taziki sauce (which is weird because I usually love taziki).  Hard to pinpoint what was off about the sauce other than it was just flat.  Still, the egg rolls themselves are a fun innovative dish that looks different in appearance but stays resolutely Mediterranean in flavor.  Next up, the fries.  Fries were cooked perfectly & while the fries themselves didn't blow my socks off, the olive oil mixture was a delicious accompaniment & a unique alternative to ketchup to be sure.  Lastly, the falafel pita.  The texture of the pita bread was perfectly warm & pillowy soft just as I'd hoped.  The falafel & veggie mix inside was good, though I'll admit I still like Greek Wraps' falafel a little more.  Pita Kitchen's falafel has a softer more mellow texture whereas Greek Wraps falafel has a little more crunch and spice.   Overall, I'd give Pita Kitchen about 3.5 out of 5, but I've rounded up largely to the discount I received (as well as a coupon for next time) & the super friendly counter service I received.  Pita Kitchen can definitely hold its own against valley based behemoth Pita Jungle, but on a personal level I still think for now Greek Wraps is king of the Mediterranean scene on the west side.  But keep at it, Reimun & Rian.  You've got a good thing going & a business model a lot of valley business owners could learn a lot from."}
{"text":"Delicious Gyros with tzatziki sauce.  Got one with extra meat, but definitely didn't need to because they had plenty of meat already on them.  Also had the hummus, both regular and cilantro, with steak, and it was awesome, too.  Welcome to the neighborhood.  I highly recommend Pita Kitchen."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but was disappointed. Walked in and watched pitas being hand made and baked fresh. Kitchen was running at full speed, service was friendly, and I looked forward to some great food. We ordered the gyro egg rolls to start and I was eggcited! They were cooked well, served with what looked like house made tzatziki, yummy but a skimpy amount, and came out fresh and piping hot. They were good, however the spinach didn't work for me. We also had the hummus appetizer, as I wanted to get my hands on some of that hot fresh pita. The hummus was good, nothing remarkable but the pita was the first big let down. It was a half cooked, doughy mess. So much potential there, and it was wasted.   I ordered the beef shawarma pita which was the biggest disappointment. When you walk in and see that the pitas are being made fresh, the shawarma spinning on the spit and read the yelp reviews, you expect something great. What I got was bland, with warm veggies and an undercooked pita. It was palatable but barely and definitely not what I would consider authentic. Never had a shawarma with lettuce on it. The baby lettuce had no chance with the heat and shawarma traditionally should have lots of onion, parsley and tomato as garnish.   Our party had several other items and the consensus was the same. Mediocre at best although the intentions were not lost on me. I suspect that the owners were not present and the quality control was lax, but I'm pretty sure that there won't be a next time for me.   Bottom line, this may be a stand out Mediterranean spot in the Arrowhead area, but it doesn't have legs if you know Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been going to the Avondale location for years. Being Middle Eastern I have such a hard time finding decent Middle Eastern food. First time I went to the Pita Kitchen I was shocked that I didn't need to add any salt, lemon or oil to the Tabouli salad or hummus. I thought wow I came on the right day, thinking it was a one time thing, but in all the yrs I've been going I never had to. Then I got adventurous and ordered the falafel (I'm very picky about falafel) ...omg now I can't go without getting an appetizer order. Their meat and chicken is always moist and cooked to perfection too. If you have not been there, you need to go."}
{"text":"Came to the new location at Arrowhead last week and the food tastes amazing. We ordered the steak and chicken kabob plate plus the Greek fries. It all came out fresh, and delicious. The order was missing one addition kabob, and they made it right by adding another kabob in addition to the one they brought out later. My son spilled some soda on the table and the manager was attentive and courteous.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fans of coming to this location for the former Salsa Blanca can rejoice in the new Greek restaurant Pita Kitchen. We had thr gyro entree which is a generous portion, sharable, also had the large Greek salad with gyro meet. This could feed two also."}
{"text":"I have to stop myself from coming here too often. I just love the gyro meat and those Greek fries are to die for!!"}
{"text":"When I first went there, I had the falafel which was great. The pita chips are awesome. But that night I got very sick and almost afraid to go back. Tonight went again and the food was good. I think this is a nice restaurant, I just feel it is a bit overpriced. I wish they would reconsider their pricing as that may deter some people. Overall w the food, pricing, and atmosphere of the restaurant I rate it a 3."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! I'm so glad they opened a second one! The chicken kebabs and pita kitchen egg rolls are amazing. Make sure you get a extra garlic sauce!"}
{"text":"I am so thankful for discovering this gem on Groupon! The food here is superb, comes out quick & is reasonably priced. They have such amazing hummus & deep fried pita chips, they are dangerously good! Their garlic sauce, rice & grilled veggies make an amazing meal paired with their hummus. They had some pretty good happy hour specials on drinks too! This is officially our go-to Mediterranean food spot now."}
{"text":"I'm typing this review as I eat.. that's how passionate I am about this food! It's kind of hard to impress me but man this food is amazing!! I got the chicken shwarma and I'm sorry to say but it blows pita jungle out of the water. The chicken is so fresh and tender the jasmine rice was a great pairing and the garlic sauce made it irresistible. I opted for salad as the side and that was great too! Service was friendly and super fast. I've found my new lunch spot!!!"}
{"text":"This place hides in a strip mall and I had no idea it was here until I was headed to Babbo To eat lunch when i stumbled upon it. Well I'm SOoOoOo glad that I did. The food is so good and fresh and reasonably priced. The salmon salad is to die for! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I like this place. The falafel is very good (not too dry & crumbly like a lot of places). The salads are very fresh also. Price is reasonable & food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for a while now and loved it so much we had them cater good for our parents birthday. Chicken kabobs, steak shawarma cilantro hummus rice pitas everything was spectacular and their delivery was right on time. Could not ask for better tasting food and the price was very reasonable. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place has the best gyro wraps that my wife and I have had in Arizona. Other ones in the same vicinity are good, but these were next level. I tried their pita chips and Jalapeno cilantro hummus as a side inside of fries for the first time today and they are AMAZING. Definitely recommend those instead of a side of fries. This was also the first place that offered a Greek salad instead of fries which my wife ended up getting. The food was hot when I picked it up and the service was also very good. We had the groupon to try it out and we will definitely be back even without a groupon."}
{"text":"Pita kitchen does it again by opening a new location in the north valley and they did not disappoint! This place is is on point with freshness and flavors. Its obvious the joint takes pride in their food.   My only complaint, I arrived a tad too early to try the fresh baked breads from their brick oven....will I return? ABSOLUTELY! MY PERSONAL GO-TO PLACE FOR GREEK FOOD."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Excellent hummus and baba ghanoush. Very friendly folks. We come here often and recommend them highly"}
{"text":"Employees are oblivious to the dirty dishes. There's absolutely no excuse.  Eat the delicious food at your own risk. Not worth it."}
{"text":"So i have to say, I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  The food was amazing, the atmosphere was good, place was clean and service was top notch.  Happy to have it in the neighborhood. I will frequent here."}
{"text":"At the time of this review (10-17-16) Pita Kitchen recently opened in the Arrowhead part of Glendale in the strip mall with Safeway. This is a casual Mediterranean-Greek Restaurant where you order at the counter, pick up a table number and seat yourself. They have booths , tables and a few outdoor tables. The restaurant was nice and neat looking. Everything looked clean.  We shared the Mediterranean Sampler (2 Falafels, 2 Dolmas, Baba Ghanoush, Hummus, Tabouli, Pita Bread) and the Two Meat Plate (Chicken Kabob, Steak Shawarma, Rice, Greek Salad ((humus is an option)), Pita Bread) So we tried quite a bit of the menu.....  Very Good overall!   Falafels were the crunchy meatball style and were herbed, hummus was creamy with lots of lemon. Pita bread was hot and seemed like fresh made. Chicken Kabob was seasoned and was tender and juicy. Steak Shawarma had nice flavor and was tender. I liked everything except the Baba Ghanoush....it was creamy and I liked the hint of smoke in it but for me it didn't have enough eggplant in it and also was made with too much tahini...but that's my taste and yours may differ.   Service was much better than I would expect from this kind of place. The cashier also ran plates to the tables and opened the door for people. We were also checked on a few times.  It's so great that a good place opened in this area!  This place will be in my rotation.  P.S. I Checked in on Yelp and got 25% my bill....Woo hoo"}
{"text":"Such good food. Always fresh, always clean, always full of flavor. Husband can't get enough of their Greek fries and pitas. Pita bread is huge serving and perfectly paired with cilantro hummus. LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Regular customer but lately the management has turned the operation over to the help and they are nasty. Came in at about 8 o'clock and ordered from the menu but the manager told me that they close at nine. So it takes them an hour to prepare a Greek meal?"}
{"text":"Probably the best Greek food I've ever had! The restaurant was very clean, seating was good as well. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in one day for lunch and now I'm here about 3 times a week. I've tried almost everything on the menu and they are consistent!! Everything tastes great, price is good and on top of that the staff is caring and respectful. Make sure to try their garlic sauce, I don't know what they put in it but its amazing and it goes with almost everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Wow!  We ordered six plates and an appetizer, and every one of us (including four children) loved it!  We had one person order gluten free, another order dairy and egg free, and we still found food everyone liked!  The atmosphere was great for a big family, the service was friendly, and we are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is our third time here. Not a good experience. They are unorganized, taking food to the wrong tables. We did not receive our food until we went back up and told them. The food is good, not as good as I remember,  but they need to get the service thing together. We will not be back... Edit: I appreciate the owner contacting me. He was very eager to try to resolve the issue. I told him that I did not need anything further.  Thank you for caring, I started at 2 stars, but I am hoping it was just a bad day. Edit 4/18 came back for the cilantro hummus and the vegetable medley. It was wonderful. I am glad we came back."}
{"text":"Very nice place, very fresh food.  We had the Greek salads with chickens and warm pita bread.  The small is plenty.  They give you a lot. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food!  It's really close to my house so I eat there frequently. I've had their Greek salad, gyro, chicken kebab and hummus and have never been disappointed in food  quality. The only drawback is they can be a bit slow with your food order so best to not be in a hurry or call in ahead of time."}
{"text":"I would never thought of taking Greek ingredients and stuffing them into an egg roll skin. The PK Gyros Egg rolls  were surprisingly tasty. Staff is very attentive to all the customers which is always nice. Atmosphere is nice with the Greek music playing and comfortable booth seats. I recommend if you are in the area to try them especially if you don't like fast food chains to dine in at."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place.  We've ordered take out  12  times. 7 out of 12  times the food was really good.  4 times the food was just ok and the last time the food was awful.  They normally open the box in front of you for take outs to make sure you like what you see.  This last time they didn't and I thought that was a bit strange.    I open the box as soon I walked out couldn't believe my eyes.  Went back in and showed the cashier that the salmon was definetely burned and it was obvious that they tried to remove the burned parts on both sides.  It was only 1/2 the size it normally is but that for me wouldn't be a  problem if the quality was ok.  The cashier was definetely embarrased and he called the cook.  The cook showed up and after looking at the salmon, he said it looked ok to  him and nothing wrong with it.  I used to LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Took out a salad with Gyro meat last night,and was so disappointed. Not only was the salad drowned in dressing,but the meat was dried out. I'm not sure that I want to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Very good food.  I had the chicken kabob plate and the chicken was cooked perfect!  Service is not fast however as I'm guessing everything is cooked to order so not a good place if you're in a hurry.  Waited 40 minutes for a take out order of two meals.  It was worth the wait and luckily I was not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Worst steak shawarma ever. Plus they packaged salad with hot dish  salad was wilted. Not interested in going back."}
{"text":"Kind of bummed that I ordered a to go Greek salad and there was no kalamata olives or pepperchinis. You'd think this is a common dish they make often and ingredients wouldn't be missed.    The salad was very good and the chicken was seasoned well."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always get their platter and fried puts chips. So good! Staff always friendly, and place is spotless. Great variety of things,  but I can't get beyond the platter. Domah is one if best I had on a resturant."}
{"text":"Stop by over here after taking a test. Not too busy around lunch time. The line was quick. Waitress was friendly and nice.  I ordered the chicken shawarma Pita meal without any additional sides. Price was $7.46. I chose the garlic sauce to go on the pita.  Overall it tasted pretty good and the chicken was not too dry. I also tried the appetizer, the egg roll dish. Extremely good and better with the tzatziki sauce that comes with it. Also tried the baba ganoush. Really good and tasty dip.  Environment is pretty spacious and clean. Restroom was clean as well. And parking is convenient as it's in a plaza area"}
{"text":"Very good and fresh.  I had gone to another Pita place and didn't like it at all.  This is delicious and I will definitely be back.  My friend is vegan and gluten free and had a great meal here."}
{"text":"Didn't expect much from this place at first but they surprisingly are consistent, one of the better Mediterranean spots in the West Valley.  Why go there: They have good selection, both for the carnivore and the vegetarian. Their selection of house made hummus and Greek fries are fun to order to share. Portions are large, their tzatziki is great and good with pretty much anything in there. They have a good selection of bottled drinks like the half liter of Coke hencho en Mexico, always a winner with a good grilled meat and fries dish.  Downside: Bummer the place doesn't have lamb as one of their main meats. I walked in craving a nice portion of lamb Souvlaki with a heaping portion of fresh tzatziki. (This is more of a hint for the owners if you're reading this!)  Overall: This place serves some good food, fresh options like salads are also available and pretty big. They should do well in this shopping plaza. Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Loved the food, the gyros meat was fresh and the Greek fries were awesome. Looking to return to my new favorite gyros stop."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time and OMG!!!! Pita kitchen is the bomb!!!! I had the chicken shawarma (without onions) and the chicken was so tender and so flavorful. My husband got the classic gyro pita with greek fries and he was in heaven!! The fries were so crispy and full of flavor! The Greek fries looked delicious with the feta cheese!!! We have found our pita/ Mediterranean place!!! We will be coming here again and again!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great prices! Loved the PK  eggrolls! My friends had the kabobs and they said they were awesome!  The garlic sauce is addictive!  We can't wait to go back next week!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! There are vegan and vegetarian options here, the food is so good and the staff are friendly and kind. I love getting the spinach pasta salad with mozzarella cheese and tofu added. The drive to the restaurant isn't bad either and is pretty easy to find. I say everyone should try this place out."}
{"text":"Portions were great and the gyro meat is juicy and flavorful. The pita also was good. They need to add lettuce for some texture. I like this place bc it's really convenient but Greek Wraps will always be my favorite"}
{"text":"Found on group on  Came back because it was so great  We had two incredible dinners  Fresh Delicious Light  Great value This is a must try restaurant"}
{"text":"Sooooooooo good! I would suggest NOT ordering online. It's waaaaay faster to go in. But absolutely delicious! Right up there with Pita Jungle! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I like this place one of the better Greek places in town. The staff is friendly service is fast and it's really clean. It's a bonus that they do military discount as well. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Come here for great Greek food!! Don't go anywhere else for lunch,  THIS is the place you want to go! The Greek salad with gyros, I would strongly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!   Food is so good and the entree's are huge!  Salmon entree is fantastic, gyro platter is huge. Greek salad is amazing!  Nicely decorated, family owned restaurant. Employees are always friendly and informative.   They have a Monday and Tuesday special gyro for $4.99. They have happy hour specials that include food and wine and beer"}
{"text":"New favorite spot close to home! Clean, friendly staff, and the food was delish! I tried the chicken shawarma pita with garlic sauce and it was amazing! Also, some of the best French fries I've ever had which was an unexpected bonus. My son had their chicken strips which were just okay but only patrons of unevolved palates (a.k.a toddlers) would order something like that at a tasty pita joint anyways so, zero deductions. Jalape単o cilantro hummus was on point! Oh and they serve beer and wine which is most definitely a plus, amiriite?? Go here."}
{"text":"The third time I've been here. Dropped from 5 stars to 2. I guess when they were new to this spot they cared about service. Waiting for food is a joke!! Doubt I'll come back now, third time wasn't a charm."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch with a friend after hiking in Thunderbird Park. Located in a strip mall in the Arrowhead area, Pita Kitchen is a tastefully decorated, if somewhat generic, small chain restaurant. You choose food from a menu board then walk up to the counter to order. We both chose the Mediterranean Sampler, which is vegetarian-friendly and offers a little taste of several menu items.   The amount of food on the plate was pretty generous for a sub-ten dollar meal. Everything \"looked\" like prototypical Mediterranean food, but after tasting each item, I realized it was the fast-food version. The tabbouleh was oversalted, the pita was fluffy and somehow too white. The falafel, baba ganoush, and hummus were all tamer, blander versions of the food I've enjoyed in more heartily ethnic eateries.   The location is convenient and I would eat there again if I was in the area and hungry for a quick bite. Ample parking is available and service was efficient."}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean restaurant. Food is fresh and tasty. Servers are friendly. Highly recommend their beef kabob and steak shawarma"}
{"text":"MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE. Went to pita Kitchen for the first time today and loved it. My husband and i ordered a few things off the menu to try and everything was hot and fresh. You must try the gyros egg rolls so delicious. If you want to try all their appetizers you can order the Mediterranean sampler and try a little bit of everything. We definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great Middle Eastern food. My family and I will be back real soon!!"}
{"text":"Great little place for quick and easy Greek food. Prices are reasonable, and the food is always fresh.  Be sure to save your receipt to take a few bucks off the next time you come in!"}
{"text":"The Greek fries are awesome! The falafel pits are really good! But not a huge fan of their baklava."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood. We really enjoyed the mix we ordered. The taziki sauce with pita was so great and we loved the gyro egg rolls. Our dinner was fantastic and will definitely go again."}
{"text":"My wife and I regularly check for new restaurants in the NW Valley, and saw Pita Kitchen had just opened. We went there a week ago and had the standard Gyros with fries. It was tasty and fresh and we decided to go back a second time. This time, I had the steak shawarma (never heard of it before), a pita with thin sliced marinated beef steak. I had it with the garlic sauce (vs the sesame sauce) and it was to die for. Absolutely delicious. We will return and we do recommend this, if you like Greek food."}
{"text":"Delicious middle eastern food. Good meats and great seasonings. Amazing quality all around, they pay attention to detail and don't cut corners. They make their own bread; always fresh.   Friendly service. Nicely decorated, modern and clean environment. They serve wine. Reasonably priced food.   Their second location in Avondale is smaller but same quality food and service."}
{"text":"Yum yum and yum! Gyro was packed full of meat, so much I almost could not eat my side of Greek fries.  Those too were amazing!  Everything was very flavorful and the portions here are really good, plus the price is on point for what you get.  I will definitely be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"Went here once, was pretty good, so I came back a second time and food was not anywhere close to what it was the first time. Unfortunately won't be back.   Check out Greek wraps if you want great Greek."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great food. Food tastes fresh and the prices are ok. I like their good customer service. I feel welcome every time. They have gyros for $4 on Monday's."}
{"text":"Awesome food especially the Greek fries. The place looks really nice and the service is great. One of the owners comes to each table and asks how everything is and if we need anything, pretty sweet thing that many places don't do nowadays.  The food is a bit priced but I think it's probably because the people who frequent there are upscale and for quality? Idk I really like this food,  place and the people."}
{"text":"Super tasty!! We are definitely addicted to their flavorful food. Crispy, fresh salads and the best hummus ever! My mouth is drooling again just writing this!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great and a much needed addition to the area.  So far I have sampled several items from their menu including the steak shawarma, chicken kabob and gyro plates.  Hummus and their gyro egg rolls.  I have been thoroughly impressed by the quality and flavor of everything on the menu so far.  My personal favorite entr辿e has been the steak shawarma due to the flavor and texture of the steak.  For me, that is really saying something because I an a gyro junky so the steak impressing me was a huge deal.  However, everything has been great.  Their chicken kabob is my wife's favorite and I have to say the chicken is flavorful and moist, never dry.  This has become almost a weekly visit for us now."}
{"text":"Pita kitchen in Glendale is a great restaurant and has great staff, and very clean place, but something is missing compared to the Avondale location. The other location is outstanding full of flavor perfectly seasoned food, except for one day the gyros was cooked too much on one side and not the other. All in all will be back for sure because they do have delicious food and great service. And love there"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Greek place. My coworker and I discovered it one day on lunch and we go back every couple of weeks (I'd be huge if we went back as often as we'd like). The pita is fresh out of the often and steaming hot every time we get our order. The cilantro hummus is literally something I could swim in (ignore that image), and the chicken kabobs are perfectly seasoned. Seriously, everything about this place is excellent and now that I'm thinking about it, I need to go for lunch tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Cilantro hummus with chicken is a favorite, along with the cauliflower appetizer. Have tried a few other dishes, and they are good too. Friendly staff. Clean. Would recommented."}
{"text":"Jalape単o cilantro hummus! Amazing! The gyro and chicken shawarma meats are our favorites. Everything we have gotten from there has been superb. The staff is always wonderful as well. They also have this garlic sauce. I don't know what's in it and they won't give me the recipe but I would probably eat a shoe if it had that stuff on it. The literal definition of \"awesome sauce.\" Oh, and I almost forgot to mention HAPPY HOUR. Are you kidding me?! Wine and beer around $3. I'm hooked. We are patrons for life."}
{"text":"The pita chips, wow. They are amazing. Crispy and soft. Perfect place to go to in west valley for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I'm happy they opened this Pita Kitchen practically next door to my house!  I usually hit the original Pita Kitchen up for lunch but now that this one is open and under the same ownership, I look forward to eating here on the weekends too because both locations serve the same great tasting dishes."}
{"text":"Always have good food, drinks, and staff. The atmosphere is nice but VERY noisy if you sit inside."}
{"text":"Good service at check in to order our food.  Waited approximately 12 minutes for our 2 gyro combos. The dining area was not busy so not sure why it took so long.  Food was delicious."}
{"text":"I just stopped in Safeway and Pita Kitchen had a coupon on the back of the receipt. $2 off a entree and $5 off if you spend $20.   I decided to check it out. I ordered the Gyro combo with a Greek salad instead of the fries. The salad had a lot of feta cheese and olives, which most Greek restaurants skimp on. The  salad was a meal in itself. I was almost full and was only going to take a bite out of the Gyro. It was so good I ate the whole thing.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Aye here again. Was very happy with my meal (gyro platter) and all of my friends enjoyed their meals. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I used to live near their 1st location in west Phx. But was absolutely ecstatic when they open this new location. The food is amazing, my go to is the chicken shawarma plate or the Greek salad with a side of taziki. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Oh yes!!! Love the food here! Reasonably priced and portions are very generous. The Gyro Pita was very fresh and full of flavor. It was very filling without eating any sides.   I like the casual ambiance. Order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. No paper plates here, they use actual plates and bowls. The cashiers are always friendly and helpful. Very clean restaurant. I will frequent this place and have already told friends and family about this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Eat here at least once a week.  WAY better than Pita Jungle!  Their Greek Dressing is amazing. Not too much oil, lots of herbs and always fresh."}
{"text":"They had a flat bread machine.it hasn't worked in month's whenever I ask about it, I get a different story...This was the last time I come here."}
{"text":"Another wonderful neighborhood gem!!! We decided to try this place one evening and it has quickly become a favorite for us. The restaurant is so clean, menu is great,  service is wonderful, and the staff is so friendly. It can get busy in the evening for take out but it's to be expected being so good. I'm so glad we have found Pita Kitchen.  I Highly recommend giving it a try....you will understand why we love it so much."}
{"text":"Really great food that is close to the house, everyone here is also really nice. The Cilantro Jalape単o hummus is fantastic and their gyro meat is very flavorful and not dry in the slightest. We have become regulars!"}
{"text":"Two hour drive there and two hours back... Worth every second... Everything I've tried is great... Thx."}
{"text":"We love Pita Kitchen! Consistently good food, excellent service and great prices for what you get! One of the better restaurants in this part of town! So much food that we share most times. Gotta try the greek fries!"}
{"text":"For fast-casual Med type food, I really can't find a complaint with Pita Kitchen. The dining room is comfortable, service is always welcoming- I really feel at home whether I'm dining in or doing carry-out, the food is well seasoned and well prepared and the prices are right. Food is prepped to order so don't expect fast-food type speeds, but do expect well above average quality.  Once in awhile I do shake my head at the cover versions of popular songs on the speakers while I'm dining, which is akin to being stuck in a Grey's Anatomy episode, but that's not keeping me away because the garlic sauce drowns that out anyhow.  I'm a regular here and it'll stay that way."}
{"text":"Every time I step foot into this place it always seems really empty. But the food is good here. This was my go to spot when I craved Mediterranean food when I was on this side of town. I'd always get the chicken kabob plate. The wait wss always about 15-20 mins, which sucked but it was worth it. I would usually substitute the rice for fries. The kabobs were juicy & had really good flavor. To top it off, their tzatziki sauce was great. But what to die for is their hummus! My fav was the cilantro & jalapeno hummus.   Service here is alright. It's really a hit or miss. One time as I ordered, the girl at the counter got my order completely wrong making me spend $5 more than I usually do (because I usually always order the same thing). Because of this, I never really ever went back."}
{"text":"Great service, clean restaurant, quality ingredients. We love the spanakopita and the eggplant pita. Nice atmosphere, too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my VERY FAVORITE places to eat!!!!! I have NOT said that in any other of my approximately 250 reviews, even if I really like the place!! I LOVE their food!! I will NEVER step foot in the \"other\" Mediterranean place I used to think I liked!!! NOPE!! NEVER!!!  The quality of the food, the generous portions, the TASTE and the obvious LOVE put into the food and the entire experience keeps us going back over and over!!!   The salad.....oh, the salad!! They put LOTS of fresh tomatoes, thick cut cucumber slices, specialty olives and large chunks of fresh feta cheese!!! NO skimping on the good stuff here!! The tasty dressing would make a great drink! Yes, I could drink the dressing!!   The chicken kabob plate is my favorite!! It has huge Double DD chucks of chicken breasts!! YUMMMM!!! So perfectly grilled every time!!  The chicken kabob and the gyro meat plate is my hubby's go-to choice. Of course it includes a generous salad portion, rice, meat and pita. OH, a pita is not a just a pita. There IS a difference even in the pita at Pita Kitchen!! The other places just don't deliver like Pita Kitchen!!  Everyone I have taken to this place of deliciousness has been just as impressed as my hubby and myself!!! It is AMAZING!!!   Take note:  They are closed on Sunday. I totally respect that and I respect them for staying true to their beliefs!! I'm bummed I can't eat there on Sunday, but I can go any other day of the week, and I'll be there often!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we were HUGE fans of the original location in Avondale and we were thrilled to find they had opened a nearby location. We had lunch there today for my birthday...yes..love it so much that it was my pick. Unfortunately, all three of us were somewhat disappointed and while the food was good....something has changed or they are making the food somewhat differently than the Avondale location.   I will say the Greek French Fries are absolutely the best fries EVER!  Seriously.  They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and perfectly seasoned with a Greek/Olive Oil/Salt/Vinegar type dressing and Feta Cheese...very light but SO DELICIOUS.  Those fries were the winning dish and could be a potential Cravee. The new restaurant is also very nice with plenty of seating and a nice interior. I ordered the two meat plate with Chicken and Beef Kabobs with Rice and Hummus and my Husband had the two meat plate with Schwarma Chicken and Gyro Meat with Rice and Salad.  Everything was good and the portions were great but the seasoning at this location was pretty heavy handed....and we usually have no objections to seasoning or spice but it's just different than what we remembered from Avondale....and we much preferred the lighter touch.    My Mother was also disappointed at her Falafel. It was overcooked with a hard, tough shell. All in all, we may give it another shot...maybe it was just the day... but there is a reason why the Avondale location is packed with people everyday...it's perfection."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. We will definitely be back soon! This is a very nice addition to the area since most of our options are chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good gyro pitas. Staff is very courteous and helpful. Food is affordable and delicious!"}
{"text":"Get the fresh bread... can't go wrong with the chicken kababs.. and the garlic sauce.... I love the falafel also.. some of the best falafel I've had"}
{"text":"My brother and I LOVE Greek vegetarian food.  Pita Kitchen did not disappoint.  The baba ghanoush was sooooo good.  The falafel were the best we have ever had.  The staff was very accommodating and knowledgeable.  We ordered the Mediterranean appetizer plate and shared the goodness.   It was enough for two and we \"licked\" the platter clean!  We are already talking about what we will order the next time we go which we hope to be very soon."}
{"text":"Nice place and people! The food came quickly and was good my only thought was the meat on the gyro was a little skimpy- definitely tastier than pita jungle but just a bit second to Greek wraps! If I am hungry and in the area I would go ag"}
{"text":"Ordered take out through their online site. Online site is easy to use, gives you lots of options (such as ordering items without sauce,etc), and also gave an estimated time when order would be ready (which was accurate). Prices are good, and food was delicious. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed... A good sign, if you ask me!! The falafel pita was ENORMOUS and delicious. I love falafel and it was one of the best I've had. Hummus is delicious, too! Good for the whole family. Staff is friendly and helpful. Be patient... It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The basic gyro place you know and love but with additional preparations and ingredients that make this one your favorite."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with this restaurant, the pita chips were crispy and delicious, humus was yummy as well. The gentleman that greeted us and took our order was very pleasant and friendly. I appreciate how nice and clean the restaurant was."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fresh, with great flavor. Some Greek food places can feel a little divey, not this place. Modern and clean atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food. The Greek fries are my family's favorite. Sometimes we drop in during the middle of the day just to satisfy our craving for them! Highly recommended this place."}
