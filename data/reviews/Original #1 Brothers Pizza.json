{"text":"Horrible customer service!  The younger guys have some major attitude - like they are doing you a favor.  Doesn't make sense when there is Papa Murphy's south across the street and Nick's Deli & Pizza west across the street.  I spent my $40 at Nick's and they were nice to me!  Learn some manners!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite, and before I even had a family (almost twenty years ago) I would go to Brothers with friends.  The pizza is great. Good thin crust, never too puffy. Plenty of toppings...   One review said Brothers was not any better than Barro's. I disagree. Barro's is hit and miss as to the quality of the pizza. Brothers is always good.  They have enough TV's for the size of the building, typically with some sporting event on.   Maybe it is because I have gone there for s o long, but I always feel like they know me. They are very personable and friendly.  The service has always been good. I know some reviews knock the service, but this place is exactly what I would expect of this type of establishment.  It is locally family owned, and the cool thing is that I heard a rumor that when their kids were younger, they frequently donated pizza to their kids schools...Not gave the schools a discount, but just donated it for class parties and such.  Bottom line = Good food, good service, good people = five star restaurant"}
{"text":"Brothers is a family owned restaurant.  They are very warm and friendly and are great to help me.  I am handicapped.  Besides their warm atmosphere, their pizza is excellent.  They also have wonderful zucchini.  Take your family and have a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Clearly this place has lasted 20 years for a reason. Service is excellent. Place is clean and food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Let me start with I'm from Elizabeth  New Jersey and pizza is equivalent to my daily vitamin. (Atlas  slice 4 times a week). I moved back to Arizona in august 2015 and have been searching for my next pizza home. I've tried 4 other pretty good stores to try to replace my hometown pizza but when I had my first slice here, I was in denial, so I came back 2 more times in consecutive  days, and it was clear, they have the best Brooklyn  style pizza I've ever tasted. I may not be Man Vs Food, but to me, a great tasting pizza has to have an almost perfect balance of bread-to-sauce-cheese ratio. AND THEIR SAUCE IS BEYOND DELICIOUS. I haven't tried anything else on the menu, not even the wings but I will today, it's been 2weeks and I've been there about 9 times already, I feel like a valued customer already because they always show me love when I'm ordering whether they are busy or not (Give me fist bumps to keep their hands clean). They are my new Pizza Home. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza. I get the lunch special every Tuesday. Everyone is friendly, and you are greeted when you come in."}
{"text":"Great for take-out as this is not the biggest layout. I definitely recommend this place for a quick pizza dinner as they have great pizza and nice service.     If you are big on meat and veggies I highly recommend the works. If you've never had this, (which I highly doubt) you should give it a shot. Or you might get the classic cheese and  pepperoni."}
{"text":"My most favorite pizza ever!! I have been coming here since I was a freshman in highschool, well that's when it was the tiny little spot on the end. The guys are always so friendly when you go in, pizza is always on point, and beer is nice and cold. It doesn't get any better then that for me!!! I Will always come here and can't say enough good things about them."}
{"text":"Really great service! My office ordered 5 pizzas for lunch and they did not disappoint. Great pizza and they even remembered to throw in plates, cups, and seasonings! I would highly suggest this pizza place to anyone looking to feed an office. We will definitely be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Thin, greasy NY style pizza. Just the way I like it! Great wings too. The prices are unbeatable. Lunch special, $3.75 for two slices and a drink. My favorite pizza in town!"}
{"text":"First visit and I'm sure we'll be back.  We're new to the area so I asked a friend where he would recommend!mend and this is where he sent us.  Friendly staff.  Place looked pretty clean and was bigger than I'd expected.  We ordered pizza and jalapeno poppers to go.  The pizza was tasty, but I do wish it was cooked a little longer (thus the 4 stars.). The crust just wasn't crispy and the cheese wasn't oozing.  Poppers were delicious...not too spicy so good flavor.  As I said, we'll be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here after being told how good this place was...they have been here for 20 years so they must be doing something right!  This location is in a strip mall on the NE corner of 75th Ave and Cactus.  They have a couple other locations but this was the closest, we went into and although it wasn't a cozy restaurant feel it was very clean and the staff was very friendly.  We ordered the special of a pie plus 20 wings, we were happy to find boneless wings here.  The wings were good we ordered them hot and THEY WERE!  We like our pie well done so it is crisp on bottom and they made it to perfection...we loved the taste of the sauce so everything melded together quite well.  We left with our bellies full and found a great new place for a great pie!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for six years. Amazing pizza, good prices, and the staff is super chill. They are friendly, always seem to be unstressed, and ask about my day. Can't go wrong with this place, anytime, any day! I've tried most other items on the menu, with the ziti being favorite right after pizza, and it all follows traditional Italian recipes. Bottom line: come here, often!"}
{"text":"I walk in here and feel close to these guys than some of my very own family. Great friendly atmosphere. The food is amazing. The pizza crust is the best I have had since living in New Jersey. The wings are crispy and perfect. The antipasto salad is great. You see a lot of the same people when you go in to eat. You know that's a sign of good food. And if you're lucky enough you'll see some dough tossed in the air."}
{"text":"Been eating this pizza for almost 30 years from when it was off Indian School and 107th. Great pizza, never disappoints."}
{"text":"We discovered this place after trying to get into another place. Well we were pleasantly surprised. I love old school mom and pop pizza places and this is def one of them. Do not expect anything fancy. You can tell that this place has their regulars who stop in for carry out and hang out drinking a pitcher while waiting. The staff is very friendly. The prices were very good and the pizza was really good. It is a little thicker than a New York style slice but has a good crunch. The sauce and cheese were really tasty. Since this is not far from my house I would go again, maybe for carry out."}
{"text":"#1 Brothers Pizza is pretty awesome. Although the decor could be updated, their food is great. My favorite is their fried zucchini. It's amazing!!! It didn't take long at all for us to receive our food and they were very courteous. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I really don't like how we have started giving 5 stars to any place that's adequate because it takes away from the places like this that really deserve it.  The pizza is great, the service is out of this world, the prices are unbelievable and the staff is just too cool. Everybody here calls you \"boss\" or \"bro\" and even if it's your first time here, you feel like a regular. These guys even gave me a free pizza because they accidentally overcooked someone else's which happened to be exactly what I ordered (but bigger!). Extra crispy pepperoni pizza? Yes please! And as I'm sitting ghere enjoying my pie, they chat me up about the Dbacks, knowing exactly how to be friendly without being intrusive.   My only complaint is that they're on the west side, and I live in the east valley. I'll definitely come by here whenever I'm in the area though!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get pizza in Peoria, Az and my family and I have been going to this restaurant for years and never fails. Wings are great, but the pizza is even better."}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza spot. I would say we order pizza and wings from here 2-3 times a month. My in-laws have been getting pizza here for over 20 years. I love having a favorite neighborhood pizza joint."}
{"text":"The best pizza and wings around!  We go once a week,  it's addictive.   Their cheese is the best.   Outstanding service as well!"}
{"text":"Not only is this the best pizza around! But they are the nicest most genuine people you will have the pleasure of meeting! Our family is having a bit of a difficult time and they went out of their way to make us feel special. I cannot thank you enough!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. You can do takeout or eat in the restaurant. Need to update there decor badly. The employees arw always friendly.  Eat pizza and be happy"}
{"text":"I've been going here for 8 years! The pizza is the best slice on this side of town. And the wings are actually spicy, not like the god awful wings you get at a Pizza Hut or Barros. Ballpark pizza is very similar but doesn't offer the same quality service. The family that owns it has generations after generations running the place. It's a great place if you support small owned businesses and want a big slice of pizza!"}
{"text":"We always have the best service and food when we go to Brothers, went there and tried the subs this time and they were excellent. 8 inch sub with drink and chips for 6.99 can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Another dinner date with the mom & of course we ate at #1 Brothers Pizza duh. I love how when we go in the other customers are ranting and raving about how fabulous everything is. Oh and I managed to remember to take a few pics of the great food and some of the awesome employees."}
{"text":"Lived in Arizona since I was 6 years old. Hands down best pizza In Arizona with rays pizza coming second. This is a short review because there's nothing else to say simple as that. The best pizza in Arizona."}
{"text":"The place was good... Not better than Borrows down the street. Lol but good. And I really liked the fact that they had my Michelob Ultra on tap for a great price with FROSTY GLASS PITCHERS AND MUGS! Although there was a mistake with my order placed for To-Go and was sitting there for quit a bit, it was good. I suppose I would come back for some wings and beer in the near future :)"}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 s because when at the restaurant, this is some of the best pizza I have eaten in a long time. Great crunchy crust, sauce not too spicy, generous toppings. That being said, my favorite thing about pizza is the leftovers for breakfast. This pizza was HORRIBLE the next day. Does not hold over well. I'll eat here again but will definitely not take any home."}
{"text":"Now if they know anything it's how to make Good ranch. I ordered 80 wings from them they supplied plenty of ranch and it  is phenomenal. The pizza is very good it's very New York style thin crust lots of cheese not so much sauce. Place looks kind of dirty so I wouldn't suggest eating there. But it's pizza really complements the ranch."}
{"text":"I love their pizza,wings and lasagna. I always order to go which comes with pizza,wings, 2 liter for about $20. Good pricing."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good! It's up the street, we eat here all the time. Family owned.  They are so nice too!  Pizza is delish, wings are great!"}
{"text":"Authentic New York style pizza!  Totally yummy!  The wings are BOMB!  I WILL go there all the time!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza ex lg with ex cheese and pepperoni. The staff were very nice.. When we got home with the pizza it was very very good. The cheese had a good flavor as well as the crust. Only thing i wish there was just a little more pepperoni on it but it was okay. The Inside was very clean. We will be back and will try there wings."}
{"text":"I've even coming here since 2006... Always Great food, excellent service, nice time. Thank you!! I enjoy the ease of the lunch special when I'm showing homes in the neighborhood. A whole pizza is too much for just me! I would highly recommend giving this place a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"So good...Back in the 80s when I was in my early 20's they started as Pizza de Naples on 19 ave and Bell rd. .We went there every Friday. Now they are called Brothers and they are still the best.  Spent my life enjoying their pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid. We've tried other pizza places but none of them are near as good as this place. I don't even have to remember my order number when I pick up the pizza. The guy at the counter knows my usual order and has it ready as soon as I walk in."}
{"text":"This was our first stop in here - mostly because we were craving wings. Fried wings to be specific.   There are several meal combos to choose from including wings, salads, fried mushrooms and more. We selected a combo with a large pizza, 20 wings, a salad, and a pitcher of soda (**it seems you get free soda refills on single drink orders and not with the pitcher). They also have a cooler stocked with beer and you can order a pitcher of draft beer too.   The wings were spot on - perfectly fried (they have a bunch of sauces - we chose teriyaki) and the Italian dressing on the salad was tangy. The pizza toppings were fresh and the crust had a great crunch. The sauce however was super bland and there wasn't enough sauce on the pizza- they should consider adding a lot more garlic.   The prices are decent ($40 for the meal deal we ordered) and the service is friendly and attentive (there were so many people working - clearly they were prepared for a Friday night rush). The restaurant itself is clean and super bright with 5 tvs tuned to sports channels. The food is prepared super fast and to your exact requests or needs (they even offer GF dough)."}
{"text":"Affordable. Local. And the people here are ones you would never find anywhere else. Place is always clean, and have local games   Love this spot."}
{"text":"Lunch with my two boys  was good, we had the two slice lunch special they were like New York style customer service is great.I want to go back and try some of their pasta dishes"}
{"text":"Brought 15 high school boys in for dinner the other night.  No problem finding space for the team to sit together and the employees were helpful in helping us order enough food for the entire team. They have some nice pizza & wing combos and even have an XL pizza that is perfect for larger groups.  Wings  were great and we tried a few differnt spice levels and the pizza was excellent!  The owner was super nice and even let me charge my phone :)"}
{"text":"Still our #1  Favorite Pizza  If you are looking at my review  STOP GO NO FURTHER  You can either Eat In or Take out PIZZA reg or Sicilian - DELICIOUS  Calzones   Chicken parmigiana  ETC    No need to look further"}
{"text":"My Hubby has been coming here since he was in High School.  We have been coming here when we are in the area since he introduced me to it.  I love this place.  It has a comfortable, welcome kind of feel.  It is clean.  We have nice service, especially this last time... The pizza I was handing to my ten year old jumped off the plate into his lap, right on his new cool shorts... They made him a new plate of the lunch special :) I ordered a special, it was SOOOOOO good, but this is the only complaint I have... They charge a dollar for each extra topping on only two slices of pizza, a buck each is too much.  I ended up eating a ten dollar slice of pizza... but it was good!! The wings are the bomb diggity for real, they are fried right and tossed in the sauce and come out cooked perfect, juicy plump chicken with crispy skin... MMMM!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley hands down, real east coast style. The wings are very good too, big and crispy and so is the ranch! awesome friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love pizza and this place is one of the best! They have big thin Brooklyn-style pizza. Order a meatball and you have giant slices of meatballs on the pizza, same with the sausage. Great crust that is crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. They also have fantastic wings!   The staff is super friendly and always upbeat. I just wish I were in the area at lunchtime - they have the best lunch specials with unbeatable prices!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! The pizza is amazing and they even have a gluten free pizza! My mother has Celiac's Disease so she had to stop going for a long time. Great service by the brothers as well."}
{"text":"I have had some good pizza, and I wouldn't claim this as the best, but what I really enjoyed tonight was the cashiers attitude. I didn't catch his name, but he was one of the brothers that ran the place (the one with slicked back hair). The guy had such passion about working here, it made me smile. And he even asked me how my day was. When's the last time a cashier did that for you? The pizza really was good - juicy cheese, crunchy crust - and the wings were crispy, without drowning in sauce. I had a really great experience here tonight. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  Their pizza and pasta are good, but I really go for the cheese steak subs.  They are the bomb."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in quite awhile. Decided to stop in after work and get some pizza and wings. Didn't disappoint. Just got a extra cheese pizza and 30 wings. The pizza was delicious. In my own opinion the wings could be hotter. But they do get them crispy. I would say out of 3 pizza places close by I would choose this again. Missed the pie here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place!    The decor is a little tacky, but the good food, pitchers of beer, and super staff make up for it.  They serve beer in the coldest mugs ever!  The beer literally had little ice particles in it and it was only $8 for a large pitcher.  Also, they have great lunch specials and the regular prices are decent too.  Lots of items to pick from from pizza (of course) to wings to like 10 different types of pasta.  Good, laid back place for kids or large groups too."}
{"text":"Extremely long wait for 2 pizzas and 20 wings. Pizza was fair, but the wings tasted as though they were fried yesterday then again today. Very dry meat. Too many other decent pizza joints to recommend this one. A bit pricey for dinner."}
{"text":"Great wings! Great pizza! Frosty beer mugs! Been coming to this place for years and the gentlemen working there have always been friendly!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Had a pepperoni pizza and anti pasta salad. This place is family owned and run. New favorite pizza spot."}
{"text":"Have been going for years, but the past year I've noticed how dirty the restaurant is.  Floors are filthy and the bathrooms are so outdated.  The restaurant needs to be  updated.  Pizza is still pretty good.  Tired of the A/C unit \"being broken\".  Really!!! It's freakin Arizona!!"}
{"text":"Good food, and the staff is friendly, helpful, but carries a definitely NYC swagger, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I found this place about 10 years ago, and it's still the best pie in town. Prices are a bit on the high side, but the pizza is good, NYC style pizza - none of that chain restaurant, cardboard crust stuff here.  Definitely a great place for an evening of pizza and wings with the family or the guys. Live sports on all the TVs is a plus."}
{"text":"WOW! Some of the BEST NYC style pizza I have ever had here locally!  The sauce, greasy cheese, and crust are a perfect blend. The crust is perfectly chewy, then the outer crust is crisp. Delicious!  Wings are pretty good. The medium were way too spicy for me, but I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy foods. The mild wings were pretty good, but the pizza will keep you craving for more!  Anti-pasta salad was ok, nothing fancy. You come here for the pizza.  They offer pizza and wing specials too.   I'm going to have to join Weight Watchers if I keep eating here. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time! Then a couple months ago I went in and ordered the usually large pepperoni pizza for my family. When I got home we started eating, but we all realized the cheese tasted absolutely horrible! I called, and the owner made a huge deal. He just said he knows the guy he buys the cheese from personally, and that guy wouldn't give him old cheese. I went over there with the pizza (all 3 of us had only taken 1 bite out of our slices), and he grabbed it from me, smelled it and said I was lying! I tried to be nice and told the owner I had been going there for years and had never had a problem until now. He continued to tell me off. In the end I got my refund, but I had been going to this place for 5 years!!! This was the first time I had ever complained about anything, and this is how I was treated. I went back again to give them a second chance, and received a burned pizza and horrible customer service. Now, I am unfortunately no longer a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Always good, always 20 minutes to pick up. Always friendly and you can't beat the prices :)"}
{"text":"My family used to go there all the time and we also used the take out quite often.The food has always been good. Pizza,Wings & Salad.The salad is where the issue is as salads do not need little White Onion pieces in it that the taste becomes nothing but Onion flavored and when you ask for (No Onions) that's no guarantee that it will be handled correctly.Again salads do not need white onion pieces"}
{"text":"So this place isn't spectacular, but it is definitely good. And good enough to keep my family and I coming back. I wish they'd throw a bit of money into the decor though. Nothing fancy just get rid of the rows and rows of booths and throw in a few tables and chairs. Anyway, the pizza is big and thin just the way I like it and the wings are flavorful and crispy. Everything I have tried here is good and I definitely recommend giving this place a try. I gave it three stars as though everything is really good, nothing is really great. I will be back of course. Especially since I live only a few blocks away."}
{"text":"This place was alright, my nephew wasn't too fond of of him barbecue chicken wings. I asked the owner for something different, he made a big deal about it. so we got stuck with unwanted bbq wings."}
{"text":"This is the best NY pizza. Family owned and operated and yummy crispy pizza. The specials they have for lunch are fantastic!  On top of that, their wings and zucchinis are delish. We bring all of our friends and family here to enjoy the pizza yumminess!"}
{"text":"Awesome  family place to eat  pizza  and wings and just hang out with friends  or family! !!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the years but not as often as I probably should. The good thing is they are in walking distance but I always drive.  Family owned and ran always clean. Decorated as many of the neighbor hood pizza places. Their wings are nice and crisp the way I like them. There is a limited selection of sauce. Pretty much mild and spicy. Their pizza curst, the thin crust is excellent. Just the way i like and I like the plain cheese pizza best.  Everyone is always helpful, friendly, and lots of smiles. They ways point us to the specials, which are a good bargain.  This is another place when you are in the area or live in the area to give a try."}
{"text":"Pizza here is bomb! The wings are good too. I'm gonna order some right now.  Edited 01/08/12 - Had the sicilian style pizza the other night. It was terrific! I am big a fan of both crust styles."}
{"text":"Good food and relaxed atmosphere with an itallian touch!"}
