{"text":"It's the number of good bars that make Aurora God's country but Baldwin's is maybe the best of the best.  An intimate size, friendly & attractive staff (except for the owner Doug : ), live music, quality decor based on local history and a nice patio; it's all good.  And even better?  There's a quality restaurant attached!"}
{"text":"The dining area is known as Baldwins and is still open. Ate there a few years ago with my family and was excellent! 
Everything is freshly made, not processed in a bag and then microwaved like the other franchise restaurants such as Crabbys. 

Big patio with live bands on Friday and Saturday nights. Fun atmosphere with
fast service by friendly, good looking staff. 

The other half of this place is called 
The Station (Right across from the GO station).
So it's often hopping right after work with an upscale crowd. 
They have a great selection of drinks and plenty of brews too... 
By far the best Pub around!"}
{"text":"I was at Baldwins this Friday for lunch with my colleagues (a group of 12) and was totally disappointed.

We walked in at 12:41 and our food did not come until a little after 1:30.  At one point while waiting I turned around and looked, I realized that 6 other tables did not have their food either (some were there before us!)  So when the food finally came after waiting for almost an hour, I was not impressed with my food.  I ordered the daily special Fish and Chips - the outside of the fish was hard like rock so half way through I ate only the inside because it was so gross and the fries on the side were all soggy, not hot fresh.  My friend ordered the mussel and she said it was not even warm.  Our server was rude too and she was not happy when we did not tip her well (personally I tip server based on the service I receive, I don't go by the standard rule.)

To me, Baldwins deserves one star.  The only reason I gave 2 is because of the nice patio and it did not take long for our drinks to come.  Also,my other colleagues who ordered the flatbread sandwish (or maybe it was a wrap sandwish) said they liked their food.  So just to be fair..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a good concept based on locally sourced food, however the execution was underwhelming. 

I happened upon Baldwin's after a yelp elite event in the area. A few of us yelpers felt like going for a nightcap and Baldwin's was the closest pub to get our fix. This restaurant is located on a nice strip of wellington near the Aurora GO station. Walking into the restaurant on a Thursday night the place was pretty quiet with only a few people sitting in the bar area, we were seated promptly. 

The menu is a concise bar style menu and doesn't really live up to the steakhouse label on the front of the restaurant. I opted for the turkey sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries (no extra charge for sweet potato fries, most places usually charge for this substitution which makes no sense). My sandwich was a fair size, but overall wasn't great. The turkey was piled on pretty generously but unfortunately it was dry, the cranberry mayo was virtually unidentifiable but the multigrain bread was quite delicious. The sweet potato fries were very crispy and nicely fried, one of the better sweet potato fries I have had. The fries were served with a jerk mayo which was WAY too salty, it was unpalatable. We did alert our waiter about the saltiness and he was quick to bring us chipotle mayo instead, the chipotle mayo was much better. 

This place only has a few big name beers on tap, nothing in the way of craft beer. They did have Rickard's which will do in a pinch (I tried the Rickard's oakhouse which wasn't great). The service was okay; our waiter did check up on us often and was quick to rectify the dreadful jerk mayo dip. This restaurant is probably a 2.5 star but I will bump them up to a 3 because they do source their food locally, when we inquired about this the waiter said most of the produce and meat comes from nearby Cookstown and that everything is made from scratch, this is always nice to see."}

Station House is only half [2.5'd] of the story...

As it is the more pubby half of the whole Baldwins.
It was late{after 10:00pm} when I arrived to Baldwins.
Last of the customers of the upscale half was leaving.

I peeked to the other side known as Station House.
Low-and-behold, Famed group of Elite Yelpers appear.
Loud-and-proud to an otherwise quiet midweek evening.

The scene is all fine-and-dandy, plenty of Tv(sports).
Patio out front seems good for People/Train[GO] watching.
Decent enough pub for session drinking, chilling.
Probably a late night, service was not too well-polished.
Food was Hit-&-Miss + wished local(OCB) brews were on tap."}
{"text":"Baldwins Restaurant is really a pub and a restaurant.

Opens till 12 am Monday to Wednesday and it was perfect for a bunch of us to drop by for a post Yelp Elite Event After Party.

Local Craft selection definitely lacking.. the closest  one can get here maybe Creemore, Rickard's and Granville Island.

At least I got the Rickard's Oakhouse  Ale which is great for the cold weather! While my friend enjoyed their Murphy or Gin Tonic with tons of Gin!

I don't expect much whenever I eat at a pub, so no exception here! Banger and Mash ($11) was not bad. Maybe because I was hungry and with all the boozes I drank. +0.5 star for splitting my order into 2 portion for sharing without requesting!

The other items I tried Truffle Mac & Cheese, Pulled Beef Poutine and Sweet Potato Fries were all so so. Good only if you have a drink or 2 or more... since you might ended up drinking more beers because they are all so salty!

Baldwins is a decent neighbourhood pub. Great location right across from Go Station and with ample parking!"}
{"text":"We went last night for a good function. This place was great. Its nice and feels comfortable.  We didn't have a sit down dinner but rather had food passed around. There was a big giant cheese and meat tray on the table and lots of food passed around.

We had sliders. Delish, chicken and beef skewers. Both great. Beef the best.  Pizzas. OK. If they warn you its hot. Its hot! :) but yum!

Everything was quality.  Nothing seemed premade. It was all made to order with fresh ingredients. We could tell.

Will be going back for sure."}
