{"text":"I put my expectation a bit high after reading the review about this place. Unfortunately, i was really disappointed about the food, it is home-cook level only. The service was great, the italian couple owners are really friendly. However, i came here for the food. I d rate it 2 stars if it wasn't for the lovely owners."}
{"text":"How could i have stayed away from this place for so long?  I just returned to Basilico after a couple years while I was working in a different part of town.  The place is nothing fancy to look at but who cares when the food tastes this good and prices are so reasonable.  As soon as you walk in the smell of fresh simmering tomato sauce and other Italian favourites hits you instantly transports your mind to that warm and fuzzy place in your heart.  I personally love the sandwiches, especially the Veal, but all of them are good.  The tomato sauce is just perfect.  I just had a Veal Sandwich with Onions, Tomato Sauce and Mushrooms for like $6 incl. tax.  Perfect for take-out lunch.  You can dine-in if you want but don't be expecting 5 star amenities.  It's just not that kind of joint and it doesn't aspire or pretend to be that.  Great food with that home-cooked taste and served fast at a decent price!  I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"For veal sandwiches, homemade italian sausage and arancini's, Paolo is your man! This little house turned restaurant is a hidden gem that can be easily overlooked due to it's location. This intimate homey environment makes you feel like you're in Italy. The food is always fresh and Paolo treats every customer as if they're family. It's become almost a tradition now that we have an espresso and sambuca shot with Paolo after every meal. Check it out, you will not be disappointed! Tell Paolo I say hi!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went on a Friday night. It was pretty empty except for one table of regulars. Most of the menu had Italian sandwiches and pasta dishes. So we decided to try both. We ordered a veal sandwich with all the toppings and a spaghetti and meatballs.  I'm pretty sure the food was sitting out for the whole day because it was cold and chewy. Total was about $25 for the both of us. The owner was friendly which I can appreciate but we're not going back there again."}
{"text":"Food made with love - that's what I experienced at Basilico.  The owners are a sweet italian couple that treat you like long lost friends when you come in.  The sandwiches are substantial and the lasagna was great (second only to my Italian friend's mom).  I really enjoyed the eggplant & zucchini sandwich.  You can choose breaded (which is delicious) or non-breaded (the healthy choice).  Either way you can't go wrong.  The sweet and hot peppers are a tasty addition, along with mushrooms and onions.  This is my go-to place for authentic Italian fare north of the 401!"}
{"text":"Three star food with five star value and service.  I came here for dinner with my vegetarian friend. She had an eggplant sandwich and I had a veal pasta, since the sign out front says they have the best veal in town.  We order at the counter with the friendliest man in the world, who puts together her sandwich, then goes to the kitchen to make my veal. I get it a few minutes later, with a piece of breaded eggplant on top because \"I just made it, so here!\" I have to say, the eggplant was amazing. The veal was okay, but I think that I might not be a big fan of veal, since I've had it a few times and have yet to be blown away by it, even at trusted tasty places.  We also grab two glasses of wine, which he filled almost to the rim (definitely more than the standard 6-7 oz.) We sat down at one of the many gingham tables that dotted the restaurant. It was casual, delicious and comfy. Really, I felt like I was a little kid, eating dinner at a friend's house (particularly since I grew up in the area).  I will definitely be back again if I'm in the area. The food wasn't AMAZING, but the fact that I payed $13  and change including tax and tip for a gigantic pasta and gigantic wine is enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"When the moon hits your eye Like a big-a pizza pie That's amore When the world seems to shine Like you've had too much wine That's amore  Bells'll ring Ting-a-ling-a-ling Ting-a-ling-a-ling And you'll sing \"Vita bella - Basilico!\" Hearts'll play Tippi-tippi-tay Tippi-tippi-tay Like a gay tarantella  When the Lasagna make you drool Joost-a like pasta fazool That's amore  This Bistro is located in an old Bungalow off of Vic Park and is a perfect Mom and Pop shop where everything is made fresh.  You know its going to be good when the owner/chef watches me eat one of his peppers to see my reaction.    One of the best lasagna in city, which is worth the drive here.   Now THAT's AMORE!"}
{"text":"Amazing veal sandwich for an affordable price, toppings coat extra but are worth it to get the best sandwich experience. Definitely a ma an pa type atmosphere but almost feels homie and nice if sitting down. Also has this place in liquor licensed . Would recommend anyone to give the best veal in town a try."}
{"text":"It's ok.  Food is passable but not the most flavourful."}
{"text":"This is a 4 star principally for value and taste. It is an unprepossessing free standing establishment that makes good and plenty basic Italian food at super reasonable prices. It has been in business for many years, and the owner has a lifetime of experience in the hospitality industry...and he is a funny and pleasant man working alone. It seems that their main clients are surrounding businesses mostly for lunch.   The food is presented at a 'steam table' with all the choices pre-cooked and help at a good eating temperature. The owner then assembles your order from the steam table. On occasion he will disappear in the back to fry some veal schnitzel for sandwiches. By the way this may be the best sandwiches of this type I have tasted in Toronto.  Lasagna, Italian Sausages, Eggplant Parmigiana, Rice Balls, various Pastas and Stuffed Vegetables are available. They are all generously 'sauced up' with a home made tomato sauce or 'gravy' (for those of you from New Jersey). A plate is usually accompanied by baked potatoes which have simmered at length in a tasty and well oiled sauce. The whole thing is presented with a nice fresh bun. There does not seem to be a combo dish over $ 8.00 or so. They are also licenced and in the evening there are a couple of very regular customers. This is a great place to take out or dine in."}
{"text":"Basilicos has been an iconic landmark in Scarborough for decades! Dishing out simple, classic, flavourful Italian food reasonably priced and portioned!  Located just north of Sheppard Ave on VP, Basilico is your Italian go-to-place for the BEST VEAL IN TOWN...and that's no bull! The decor is very classic italian, rustic furniture, backdrop of Italian murals, statue, and red/white checkered table cloths....  You can tell that once you come across Paolo (the owner) he speaks, treats, and cooks....from the heart.  His hospitality is beyond words, and can cater to any needs.   When we walked in, he greeted us with a smile and even offered some samples of Sicilian Eggplant he just cooked earlier (breaded eggplant)  FOOD: mama mia! Chicken Parmigiano with Penne marinara: portion, price, and the size of the chicken was more than enough.  Equal balance of batter used, and not overcooked. Pene cooked al-dente, and most of all the marinara sauce was not acidic, but rather smooth....4.5/5!!!!!!  Best Veal in town!: hell yea! tenderized, and full of flavor, not excessively breaded, not chewy, just perfecto! served with the al-dente spaghetti and marinara! que belissima! 4.5/5  Tartufo! 4/5 chocolata served with whipped cream, and crackers.....great way to end off the dessert.  Other notables.....wine by the glass. 8oz ($4.75!!!!) extra dry vino went well with the heavy italian dish.... BEWARE of the scotch bonnet peppers.....those will burn a hole right through you and your.......lol...   I will definitely be coming back here!!! arviderci Paolo see you soon!"}
{"text":"Nice little place on Victoria Park that I swear I have pasted by a million times without noticing them being there. A small little house south of Pleasant View plaza, beside a small garage. We ordered the Veal and pasta, rich ball, sausage with roast potato. Everything was great. The owner is nice and friendly. And the price is good too."}
{"text":"this is a really cute place close to my neighborhood, my boyf and i decided to come here after i read some good yelp reviews (id seen the place before but never got around to actually trying it).   the service was so friendly and he gave us 2 coffees for the price of one which was very sweet. i love the decor and music, its very old-timey.  i ordered a chicken sandwich and he ordered an eggplant sandwich, which is vegetarian, and they were really good, my only gripe would be that the bread is a bit dry. otherwise its a really nice little place with reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Exactly like the yelp 3 star saying says...this place is A-Okay!   I had a craving for Italian and I had gotten home late and didn't want to spend a lot at a sit down, so we looked this place up and make the trek to check it out.  I actually love the place..it's a total hole in the wall, that has clearly been there for ages. It's a converted house, next to a garage. When you walk inside it looks a bit like a kitchen, with a bunch of tables. The walls are covered in airbrushed Italian scenes and there is a sort of bar to the side, where you place your order.  The menu is quite limited though and I was disappointed that there is not a single pasta dish. Instead this place seems to specialize in sandwiches.   The gentleman who owns the place and makes the food was really the highlight of this place and would be the reason I would keep coming back. He is sweet and cheerful and kind and was quick to offer us samples to try.   I ordered eggplant parmesan and my husband ordered a veal sandwich. Everything was fine, although nothing special. My husband ordered a caesar salad and the bacon bits were the sort of fake, packaged kind an the muchrooms for the sandwich were from a can.   So yes, this food IS made with love, because this gentleman who runs the place is lovely and has a true pride in his food. And the prices are extremely low. But it's still not the best quality and the taste suffers from it.  THAT said, you are not going to find such a large, veal sandwich for as cheap.  For these reasons I sort of equate this place to an Italian Subway sandwich shop. That's not a bad thing! The quality is on par with a fast food sandwich place and the prices are low. You know you ALL eat at Subway from time to time, when you just need a quick sandwich. So if you're in the area, I would check it out!"}
{"text":"Cozy, quaint, authentic, great service and lunch specials with good portions and also licensed so you can enjoy a glass if wine or beer!  A nice place to have a casual lunch hot table style."}
{"text":"Good Italian food served out of what looks like a converted bungalow. Seriously, if you weren't looking, you'd probably drive right by this gem of a place.  Healthy, hearty portions served by a couple who clearly love what they do. I was craving something meaty so I ordered the meatball sandwich with cheese and onions. A few minutes later, a huge-ass sub was handed over. Amazing.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if there was a next trip, I'd try the much-talked about veal sandwich.  This is what I would imagine it would feel like going to my nonna's house. And since it's my nonna's house, parking is non-existent. Instead, park at the plaza next to the garage and walk over."}
