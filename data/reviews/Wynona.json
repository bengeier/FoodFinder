{"text":"Great vibe and thoughtful staff. I was excited for Wynona to open and so far it is better than I'd hoped for. The patio is great as is the bar seating overlooking the street. Perfect at sunset. 

Ps. The Nebbiolo by the glass is fantastic."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to the neighbourhood! Everything was delicious (the agnolotti, clam pasta and snap pea salad were faves) and the eclectic wine list was lovely. The interior is beautiful, but the patio is a little underwhelming."}
{"text":"With the untimely demise of Saturday Dinette, Wynona is a welcome addition to Gerrard Street East, with its sophisticated but comfortable take on  Italian food.  

Wynona's interior is comfortable, bright and well laid out. There is a patio, but when we visited it was really bright out and there was no shade, so we opted for inside. 

The wine list was fairly unique. We had an excellent rosé from Lebanon, which was an unexpected delight. The staff were very knowledgeable about the list, and our glasses were always full.

The food was excellent all around. We started off with grilled focaccia bread and a side of Portuguese sardines and roasted peppers. Though they are separate dishes, the olive oil served with the sardines is a great dip for the bread. 

Our second dish was the charred heirloom carrots served with chickpeas and yogurt. This was nice and light with a slight tartness to it.

For our mains, my partner and I both ordered pasta dishes. I had the cuttlefish ink spaghetti with BC clams. The noodles were perfectly al dente. My partner had the rutabaga agnolotti with ramp butter and potato crumb. For something in a butter sauce, it felt surprisingly light and perfectly cooked.   The only minor complaint is that the dishes were a bit on the small side, so you'll definitely want to try some appetizers. 

For dessert, we shared tiramisu which was great and fairly sizeable. 

Overall, the service was great. They passed the water test: our glasses was refilled before it could be emptied. Our food came out at a reasonable pace and they came to pour our glasses frequently. 

My only criticism of the restaurant is the small-ish portions of the pasta dishes. Otherwise, it was a perfect night out."}
{"text":"I rarely Yelp from the restaurant, but I'm still here. 

Terrific meal with best bread (bread can be very good) and wine. Pasta and fish. Every dish was perfect. Delicious. No kidding. 

5 stars."}
{"text":"Bright and modern yet also cozy, this place is amazing! Dishes feature vibrant local ingredients. Try the salad with sunflower purée and snap peas, totally unique and fresh combination; perfectly cooked tender fish too. Friendly and helpful staff makes great wine recs. Cap it all off with a flavor-packed tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Incredible aesthetic and food. The ham with asparagus & boiled egg is to die for. My lady ordered the Rutibaga Agnolotti pasta and it was also very tasty. A true gem on a rather sad street"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great wine selection!

The decor is airy and inviting. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The food is fresh expertly crafted."}
{"text":"Just around the corner this delightful restaurant was a treat. Service was really friendly and helpful, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere/design of the space is great. I'll be back."}
