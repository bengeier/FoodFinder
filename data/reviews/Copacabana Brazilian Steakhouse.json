{"text":"We came for the Sunday brunch.  It's expensive but you can skip lunch after eating here.  Great variety - typical breakfast food like omelets , a variety of cheeses, breads and fruit but also has crepes and nice salads.  They also bring six different meats to your table - the Chicken Parmesan was my favorite (even better than the beef).  It costs $30 per person - I would recommend this for a nice brunch with lots of variety."}
{"text":"Here on a Saturday night with great friends. Fun time with excellent entertainment. Food and service really beat all of our expectations. Wait staff was perfect. They came around way faster than we could keep up. Made us feel very welcome. The atmosphere is very nice and classy. Highly recommend this place :-)"}
{"text":"It's great for big parties, there's an endless amount of food going around. Fun for kids because there's shows and music playing. And fun for dads who love to watch sports because there are tv's playing all around. The meat is well cooked and there is every type of meat you could think of going around. Along with the meats they serve warm cornbread, delicious cinnamon-sugar coated pineapples and enticingly good fried bananas."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Rush, Rush. It seems like one of those places that they want you in and out as fast as they can. Not a good experience as  far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and specially this location. This is our go to restaurant for big group dinners and we've never been disappointed. Service is always amazing. Management is incredible. And the food! Never ending meat! Unlike many Brazilian restaurants they don't save the good cuts for last when u r full and can't even eat another bite. A wide variety of all the meats including the premium cuts come out right away."}
{"text":"Great place!
The food, beef in particular, was extremely well seasoned and cooked. The servers and carvers were very attentive even on a very busy night.
Good variety of side dishes. The crowd was good, mostly young adults but there were also a few families with kids. It was a bit more dressy than I imagined. All in all it was an excellent night out and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Service was not great what so ever. Food was good but it was taking a long time for the steaks to come out. Whenever we would \" request \" a specific type it would never come out, and we would have to ask 3-4 times until it eventually came out."}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse. Went for Christmas dinner and was quite pleased with the food & service.  Delicious cuts of beef and chicken and lamb.  Fast loop of skewers to choose from, and everything was fantastic.  The grilled pineapple is astonishingly great - and the parmesan crusted steak was marvelous.  I like my beef rate, and was not disappointed at all.  If you prefer it charred, they can probably accomodate you.

Warning to anyone with physical impairments - the main entrance is stairs up or down, not easily wheelchair accessible.  They do have an elevator but it's down the back alley outside and through the kitchens. Not the most appetizing trip.  But it did work for getting my dad and his walker to a table."}
{"text":"This was so delicious. I went here for my friends birthday.
The experience was great. Now I want to have my birthday here.
The staff was very, bathrooms clean, food ready to go.

My faves were the garlic steak, chimichurri steak, cheese balls, and grilled pineapple. MMMMM so delicious."}
{"text":"For all the food you can eat, the attentive service, and the live dancing I can say it's worth the money. I had my birthday there and it was great. This place is perfect for groups."}
{"text":"Baaaaaaaaaaaad service. Not worth your money. Better to go on a week day to the one at yonge and eglinton."}
{"text":"I heard good things about the Copacabana Brazilian Steak house from my brother, he went to the one on Eglinton Ave, which I suspect is better.  This review is for the one on Adelaide St, I was there on a Friday night.  I am writing this review because I feel like I got ripped off.  

I know some people write about d√©cor and all that stuff, I try to keep it strictly about the food.  I don't care if it's a hole in the wall if it's good food, its good food. 

I went on a Friday night it was $42.00 a person, they charge you for the water and mix for your drinks.  For just me, my bill was $100 and I had three drinks.  

Now the food, first off its buffet for your sides, right there is a warning about how it's going to be and I'm pretty sure Sobeys has the same sides.  They had a bread station, a salad station with lots of pasta salad, rice, beans, potatoes and some other veggies, all of which left me feeling underwhelmed.  Like I said everything can be purchased at Sobeys, Metro, Longos, etc., take your pick.  They tasted like they were.  For $42 a person I don't want no pasta salad, is that even Brazilian? On the plus they did have some steamed mussels in a lemon sauce, but my feelings about lemon sauce is anything in a lemon sauce isn't going to be good.  Once again my theory was correct.  So that's the sides.

Now for the meat, which I must say it's either smothered in garlic or cheese.   Anything smothered in cheese or garlic is going to be good.  So then yes based on that the meat was good, but not 42 dollars good.  The better cuts of meat like the leg of lamb and fellate mignon the servers only come around to your table twice.  Yes I was counting; mama didn't raise no fool, especially when it comes to food.  All the other cuts of meat are the cheaper cuts smothered either in garlic or cheese or a combination of both.  Yes they did have chicken which I didn't have because it's chicken, sorry there ain't nothing special about chicken.   Things that they didn't have, suckling pig, salmon, shrimp, Moroccan chicken, BBQ pork ribs, turkey breast wrapped in bacon, beer and garlic drum stick (the only chicken they had was the parmesan chicken), oh they did have brisket (came by once) which isn't on their online menu (I am not a fan of brisket, so I didn't have any).  I got the feeling that the servers kept coming around with the flank steak, because it all looked like flank steak to me but mind you each time it was seasoned differently. 

Yeah they had the dancer, I guess they were neat to see, but once again I was left feeling very underwhelmed and with body image issues after I saw them, I guess it helps the customers eat less.  I am writing this review the day after I went, I am still confused and feeling ripped off about my $100 bill.  I would like to point out I wouldn't care if the bill was $300, as long as the food is good.  

The best thing about the night was the friends I went with!

Overall I would give this a meh, I don't know how long they'll be around."}
{"text":"Great place , a must if you like meat .
went their Sat at 4 pm ,by 4:40 the place was full .(advisable to do online reservation).
Gd ambiance 
The Hosts were extremely beautiful and full of +ve energy.
Also the waiters & waitresses young beautiful and very helpful. 

Food was set buffet of salads and all you can eat of( mainly meat) on big skewers ,Also Chicken & shrimps. (my favorite was the Moroccan Chicken and shrimps) 

I will definitely go again ."}
{"text":"Service upstairs was horrible, we had been sitting for a very long time and not one server came to our table. There were 3 of them hanging out at the bar watching the tv and chatting with the bartender. Eventually we got up, took our stuff with us and found a manager who sat us down stairs where the service was better. We will not be going back to this location because this experience was so uncomfortable.

Food is good as usual we will only go to the other locations."}
{"text":"I believe this place has just opened as the signage is poor.  It's easy to miss unless you know exactly where it is.  The exterior is very unassuming but it's quite nice inside.  The service staff were quite good, and the food as well.  Go hungry if you're going to visit as it's easy to over indulge.  Would reco."}
{"text":"Went here for my best friend's birthday on a Sunday. To start, we reserved our table for 7:30. When time came to be seated, we were told they could only seat half of us for now because the other table was still occupied. We were also told that the people who occupied the table have already paid, they just needed to get up and leave. It was frustrating because what we thought would be a 5 min wait turned into a 20 minute wait for us. Once we were seated, we couldn't even be angry because we were already a bunch of starving people. The meat service was slow for a Sunday night and most of the meat was so salty, it was like eating a big piece of rock salt. At one point, we were served bacon wrapped sausages that were still raw on the inside. I'm pretty sure you can't cook sausages the way you cook steak. 
Then at the end of the meal, the server mixed up some bills and we were pretty shocked to find out that they charge for water. As compensation, they gave my best friend an employee discount for his bill at the end of the night. Overall, a very disappointing experience for such a hyped restaurant."}
{"text":"Best bartender! Made the best gin martini (dirty) ever! This location had too notch service. Sometimes other copacabana locations can feel a bit pretencious... Not sure why. But this location has THE BEST vibe. This is an all you can eat restaurant. You need to 1) love eating steak and 2) love eating steak... These are different selections of meats.. The top favourites for me are: cheese stuffed prime rib, chimichuri, top sirloin, garlic sirloin, grilled pineapple. Bottles of wine start at $30. This is a great place to celebrate a birthday or special occasion. Reservations are highly recommended. There is also a 2hr seating limit so be mindful of that. On Friday and Saturday nights there are bellydancers- which make the experience all the more enjoyable. We used to travel to Niagara location but ever since finding about Vaughn this has become the go to spot. At first the location threw us off and we were concerned the place would not live up to our expectations set by the Niagara location...but after entering it definetly surpassed it! '"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars actually.

All you can eat meat. Sounds good, right? Skip the appetizers, grab some salad from the salad bar and just eat different varieties of meat.

The way it works is that you are presented a card when you are seated at your table. If the card is flipped to green then the waiters keep coming back with different varieties of meat. If you are done or want to take a break simply flip the card to red.

While the concept is great and the food quality isn't bad on its own, I've had better Brazillian steakhouse experience in Fogo De Chao in Chicago. If you ever go to the states I suggest that you check them out."}
{"text":"I've never been to the other locations before so I can't compare this one to the others, but I loved it and would definitely come back in the future (and would try other locations).

First off, the interior is really nice.  We were a group of 6 that came for a birthday, and we were seated promptly.  Actually, because we came on the actual day of someone's birthday, they got their meal free which is pretty nice.  The service was great, all of the servers were fast, friendly and accommodating.

Everything that I tried from the buffet was great.  But the meat, all of it, was just yummy.  I LOVED at all of the meat was rare....as someone who always eats meat rare (and will request blue on occasion) this was great for me and everyone else in my group.  I have a personal pet peeve of places that overcook steak.  Now if you like your meat more well done (slightly judgmental of me here, but if you are going out for steak and order anything above a medium rare I think it's a waste of a good cut of meat/money/time LOL) you should probably request this ahead of time, so that you aren't disappointed. 

The cinnamon roasted pineapple is to die for and the cornbread is amazing.

Overall great experience and would come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are both new to the area and we were eyeing on copacabana for few months. Finally had some time to make a reservation and went in. We were a little early and let one of the hostesses know of our reservation. She said to wait, so we waited. She didn't get back to us for good 20mins. So, we talked to the other hostess, didn't get back to us for another 10 mins. While we were waiting, the other customers who came in with the same reservation time as us were seated earlier than we were. After asking for the third time, we were seated. Other than that, food was good, and service was nice. If there's going to be a hostess turn over, will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends. We had made a reservation but still had to wait an hour for a table. If we had not made reservations, the wait would have been 4.5 hours instead.

For food, customers go out to get whatever sides they want and then come back. Once seated, servers will come around with meats and ask what you want. What I really didn't like about this was that the servers only had small skewers of meat and would almost never be able to serve a chunk of meat to each person at my table. It was not the huge meat eating experience I was expecting. Once you've tried a number of items, servers will ask what you want to come by but this is a lie. They are unlikely to actually bring what you want to the table. On the bright side, the food here is great. My favourite would have to be the cinnamon pineapple.

During the dining experience, Copacabana will have the occasional dancers coming around as well as a performer on the Chinese silks. This was a great distraction from my hunger when waiting for more meat."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night for summerlicious... we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. Our table for 8 was located right beside the buffet station and right outside the kitchen. Therefore all the carvers would pass through our table first, I felt like we got the best service in the house. Can't wait to go back to eat some more grilled pineapple."}
{"text":"First time for my family and I,  wanted to go for a long time , was not disappointed, very highly recommended to anyone who likes meat, plus the live entertainment was an added bonus, would definitely go back . Must comment on one particular server, as he was the only one that asked us if we wanted any particular meat and upon our request was very prompt in complying and also keep checking back to make sure that we were not in need of anything, service like this  goes a long way, made our first time that more memorable."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent. The quality of service was top-notch they really took great care of us it is very pricey but it was a premium experience"}
{"text":"I would honestly avoid this location. Especially if you're bringing someone to get the real Copacabana experience. There were no performers, very small variety of meat, we were not informed that you had to special order certain items like salmon or shrimp. Items at the hot table where not hot and where not replenished frequently. it was also pretty difficult to get water refills."}
{"text":"We had a resvervation for a big party. They made my friend sign a contract with credit card information to ensure the number of attendants and time of arrival. We booked for 8:30pm, arrived 15 min early, but didn't have a table until 9:30pm. They made us We waited for more than an hour and all of us were starving. It was ridiculous that they asked us to arrive on time and they did not even have a table. What is the point of making reservation?

Food is so so - pineapple was good and juicy, but steaks were very salty and burnt. In-house service is HORRIBLE though. The servers were slamming meat on my salad WITHOUT even asking if I want it or not (PS: I had my card thingy on table showing red - meaning slow down, no more food please - apparently servers don't care). One of them even dropped pineapple on my napkin and ran away.

Half-way through our dinner, servers were cleaning up our table and asking if they can take the plates away. One of them took my plate away and never replace a new one to me. I had to go get a new plate at the salad bar myself. And then I realized why they kept asking us if we are done or not... because there were no more meat coming!! I didn't eat alot but I felt so bad for 
customers who came after us because their only food is the salad bar.

This is so far the WORST restaurant experience I had in 2015. I had been to the same chain in Niagara Falls. They had less meat selection, but service was not as bad. I am 100% sure I will not come back to this location ever again, and will recommend small/big parties not to hold events here  (unless you want all your guests stuck at the entrance for over an hour and go home with empty stomachs)."}
{"text":"Walking in, I was impressed..... very nice atmosphere, we went on a Friday, the music was a little loud but the show (dancing) was amazing. The food is incredible..... the have chicken, beef and pork. All the food was cooked nicely and you can tell the difference between what you're eating.   You can have as much meat as you like, the drinks are not badly prices considering its Downtown Toronto and it's worth to go their and have an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"It is very RARE to see a WELL DONE steakhouse such as this. Like what I did there? 

From the point of entry to being seated and eating and to our ultimate exit, the visit to Copa was thoroughly amazing. They offer a very nice atmosphere with elegant decor. A great choice if you were to celebrate an anniversary or birthday which we happened to witness. My girlfriend and I were seated at the top level of the establishment with a view of seeing the whole floor and enough privacy to enjoy our badass meal. 

The service is great. Servers come to you offering numerous selections of steak, chicken and all sorts of appetizer type food such as cornbread and fried cassava (delicious), in a quick rotation. You almost can't say no as everything seems mouthwatering. The sliced portions could be more generous but with a whole floor to feed I don't blame them. They eventually come back around with repeated favourites so you won't leave unsatisfied that you got shorted on that one specific steak. The quick trip down to the main floor is where you collect the buffet items, offering salads, quinoa, breads with dip, rice and mashed potatoes just to name a few (I went all out on these, no shame lol) 

Being there on a Sunday, it didn't seem busy at 430pm but as an hour passed, all seats were filled. This place is popular for a reason.

Price: $45per person so our bill came to $110w/ tip. Worth the price in my opinion as you can spend endless ours on unlimited steak freshly cut for you plus great service. No complaints."}
{"text":"First timer and as a connoisseur of customer service, the service was phenomenal. Servers were attentive to our drinks and if we were interested in particular meats. This is truly the ostentatious version of a buffet. 

We thought were going to get seafood on top of the regular meat as it was advertised on the but none came out! Still can't wait to come back and check out other locations!"}
{"text":"Copacabana was my first experience with Brazilian BBQ. It set the standard for me. My favourites are the butter steak, Parmesan steak and shrimp. With all the protein options, it shouldn't be overlooked that the salad bar is quite good. Their strawberry spinach salad, kale salad and quinoa stand out to me. I've been to both downtown locations and in comparison, the Vaughan location met my expectations. Their servers and carvers were polite, funny and on point."}
{"text":"Bad for groups, but definitely good food!

We had a decent time here and the food was definitely good quality, but I do not recommend coming here in large groups.

We were a group of about 16 or so and we actually had less service than other tables, and yet we are charged an automatic 18% gratuity. This makes me FURIOUS. Carvers would arrive at one side of our table, and I would try to make eye contact or wave and was frequently ignored. I should not have to yell just to get service in an buffet style setting.

There was 5 separate occasions where carvers would walk right by our table, and I was waiving my arms to try get some meat. I SHOULD NOT have to do this to get served.

What made me more furious is that smaller tables of 2-4 people would get each type of meat as the carvers walked by, but the carvers would often only offer meat to 1 or 2 people at our table of 16.

The one redeeming point was that our server asked us if we had gotten everything we asked for. When I said no and that I was looking for a specific meat, she went asked the kitchen to put some on the grill. The carver still ended up skipping our table for a round or two, but I eventually got my picanha at my table. :)

When we left, I was not overly full (although maybe this is best from a health perspective).

I'll likely be back but I strongly recommend not going in groups unless you like automatic gratuities and worse service."}
{"text":"We are from NY and found this restaurant online after some research, we decided to try the restaurant out. The food and service was excellent. There was a variety of different meats, and the salad bar was great as well. Not only was there salad but also rice, potatoes, beans etc. The waiters were consistently at out table asking us if we needed anything else. The meat selection was awesome (filet mignon, prime rib, lamb, flank steak, shrimp, chicken) and MORE. Everything was overall great. The only reason why I am giving this restaurant 4 stars is because their currency exchange was 1:1 even if we paid with a credit card. I understand not taking american currency in Canada ( that makes absolute sense), but the fact that if you pay with  a card you will be charged the same amount in american currency doesn't make sense. The bill was $70 more because of their 1:1 policy. We didn't make a complaint or anything it just didn't make sense that they didn't exchange to the proper amount in american currency. We still gave a great tip and the restaurant was still excellent. Food and Service get  5 stars. Will definitely come back if I am ever in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Copacabana is just wonderful! 

Like any good Brazilian steakhouse, you want to turn up hungry. Very hungry. Because you will eat more than you thought was humanly possible. But it's all good stuff. 

The steak is all spectacular. Of particular note are the cheese infused steak, and the bacon wrapped filet mignon - with real bacon! None of this North American stuff! The cajun chicken is also really good. Make sure you mix it up with some cinnamon pineapple to keep your mouth from drying out.

If there's ever anything you don't manage to grab, the servers are more than willing to hunt it out and bring some your way. Always nice when you have a craving.

The self-serve side bar is really good as well. It is super hard not to fill up on cheesy bread and mashed potato. So good!

It is pretty pricey, but it's worth it given how much food you get, and the high quality of it.

There are two reasons I'm not giving them 5 stars. Firstly, both times I've been there I've had a reservation, and I've still had to wait 30 minutes for a table. Even on a Wednesday. I get that the meals take a little longer than at a normal full service restaurant, but they should have worked out the average sitting time by now. 

Secondly, they give you massive spiel at the start of the meal about how your cards will determine whether the servers come to your table with more food, but then the waiters never follow it. We sat with our cards on red for 10 minutes, still being offered food. It was only when our plates were cleared that they stopped. Not a huge deal from my perspective, by why go to the effort of telling me it's the way to order if it's not really?

Overall, a great place to go for a fun night out with friends, or a celebratory dinner."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit to Copacabana downtown.  We had a reservation at 9pm on a Sunday, and I had some concerns about whether there would still be a lot of meat choices at that hour.  When we entered, the place was PACKED - lots of groups having celebrations.

Having experienced a number of Rodizios before (mostly US chains like Fogo de Chao;  Texas de Brazil, etc), I had a benchmark for what to expect.  This location met those expectations!

The salad bar comprised of 3 different stations, and offered way more than \"salads\".  There were charcuterie items (Prosciutto; salamis; cheeses);  many variations of salads, as well as a number of hot sides (potatoes, grilled veggies, fresh baked breads, even mac and cheese I believe).  

The minute we were seated at our tables, we took turns to head up to the salad bar, and we flipped our cards to \"yes\" and the meats started arriving.  I usually order my beef rare, and even though most of the meats on offer were medium rare at best, everything was tender and flavourful.  Favourites include:  Chimichurri steak;  parmesan crusted filet mignon;  garlic sirloin.  My concern re. lack of choices were mostly unfounded - although some of the offerings outlined in the online menu were not available (we didn't see any shrimps nor lamb, and the only chicken flavours were parmesan and drumsticks).

Admittedly due to the late dining hour, we were pretty \"lightweight\" in terms of our meat consumption.  But I can imagine returning here with a bigger appetite, at an earlier hour, and indulging more, and burning it off the rest of the evening.  

We frequent steakhouses, and this offers a great change of pace - for about the same price (or less, even), you get a huge variety of meats to eat to your heart's content as well as many sides to choose from.  Compare this to my usual order of a ribeye steak @ ~$65 in a steakhouse, that comes with 1 side, Copacabana offers a great deal.  

Their wine list had sufficient options by the glass as well as reasonably priced bottles, if you're not looking to blow your budget.  Four of us with 1 bottle + 2 glasses of wine, + 18% tip came to $355."}
{"text":"The new, ultramodern restaurant on Adelaide has elevated this Brazilian steakhouse chain to a whole new level. This place is gorg! 

There were over 20 cuts of meat when we went (I was ambitious and tasted them all). The standouts for me were the bacon-wrapped filet mignon, picanha, salmon and the Moroccan seasoned chicken. The sizzling meats were juicy, tender and, for the most part, well-seasoned (I found the rib-eye a bit too salty for my palate).

The samba dancers were great, but don't expect a lengthy show.

Definitely try their cocktails - the Blue Abacaxi and the Caipirinha were my fave.

For $42.99/person, you're getting great value for an all-you-can-eat restaurant that serves quality meats and a galleria of salads, side dishes and fresh breads.

This place would be great for group dinners."}
{"text":"We headed to Copa to celebrate a bday with a party of 5 this past weekend. After entering the restaurant and being really impressed with the decor and ambiance, we were really excited to try to food. Unfortunately, things didn;t go as planned. There was a huge line up of people around the bar waiting to be seated. Even though we had reservations for 9:15pm, we were not seated until 9:50pm. This delay obviously made our party pretty cranky as we were all hungry and didn't want to fill up with drinks. When we were seated, we immediately set out to try the salad bar. Overall, it was impressive with 3 stations of antipasto and salads, bread, and carbs (rice, beans, mac 'n' cheese). As we returned to our table, we were immediately inundated with the servers dishing out every kind of grilled meat you can imagine. I am a vegetarian so I cannot comment on the taste of the meat but all members of my table said it was delicious. This would have been a 4.5/5 star night if it wasn't for the constant fire alarms that went off mid-way through our meal. Between the blasting music and the piercing screech of the alarm, our ears couldn't take it anymore so as soon as we finished up eating, we headed for the door. 

Pros: great tasting meat, impressive salad bar (and a reduced price for vegetarians), friendly waitress
Cons: loooong wait time for table (even with reservations) and (constant!!) annoying fire alarm for pretty much 1/2 of out meal.

Because there are many other restaurants in the area that have great food AND honour reservations with no alarm delays, I give Copa 2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special and far too overpriced for what it is. 

The buffet station is really something to avoid - it looks messy and untended.

The meat itself is tasty and the servers who serve the meat are great. The waitresses who bring the bills are pushy and rude. 

For 2 people, it costed us $160 including tax and tip. This was buffet for 2 people, 4 vodka cocktails, and 1 desert. Definitely not worth it. 

You can get sick of the meat pretty quickly, I wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"After visiting this place twice (once on my birthday, the other on my partners bday) I would have to say this is one of the MUST SEE restaurants to visit in Toronto. The food is exceptional and savory. The  location is perfect and the entertainment is amazing.

Lets get down to basics, first of all go when you haven't eaten lunch lol its a place where you want to save all the room you can for eating. Think long term, since both times I was there was for over 2 hours. Start with NO carbs... light salads at the buffet or something small so you have a chance to eat all the meat you can.

The one thing that attracted me to go back Parmesan Infused Fillet ( Chicken and Beef ), honestly the best meat you can find in the city at that price, If you are going with a large group do let the waiter know before hand as it makes it quite hard to split the bill at the end of the day.

The service was always above par, very politely greeted when you enter, the servers are always sweet and the manager on both occasions came by to wish myself and my partner a pleasant bday on our visits."}
{"text":"Same experience as others - Saturday night, reservation for 8:30pm for 4 - but apparently reservations are worthless here and we waited past 9:30 to even be given a table. It was absolute chaos in the entrance way, hostesses had no idea (and zero charisma or a hint of understanding of customer service) what was happening. The offered explanation (with no apology) was that \"some tables had exceeded the 2 hour table limit causing a delay\". That is not an OK excuse for over an hour wait for the 25 people+ crowd of us waiting- that should have been made clear when they accepted the table and they should be politely be reminded and not served further when they reach the time, as they do in other restaurants.

It wasn't so much who had a table reserved first, more who shouted the loudest got seen to first - not OK. Bigger parties also got seated first regardless of the time they had booked for, I assume to just clear some of the bodies out of the way.

When we eventually were seated (admitting defeat that patience would pay off and instead sending in my 6'4 husband to start pressing them what was taking so long apparently did the trick)- the food was delicious. In particular the pineapple, the cheese prime rib and the parmesan chicken were all excellent. Being seated near several large parties, the meat was often taken to them first and ours ignored, but our waiter picked up on this and started directing food over to us which was appreciated. The only meat I didn't enjoy was the bacon-wrapped filet mignon which was just a salty bacon mouthful - if there was steak tucked away in there, it was very well hidden! Salad bar offerings are good but designed to fill you up (carb-heavy options like bread, potatoes and pasta are plentiful - beware and save yourself for the meat!)

Few other negatives - we were overcharged for drinks on our bill and some people were having sex in the women's wash rooms (in 1 of only 2 cubicles) causing a long, embarrassing wait. Took 20 minutes to get any drinks to our table once seated. 

Food is good but it just wasn't worth the hassle to get it. Until they get their act together, avoid."}
{"text":"On the lower level of Copa Adelaide exists Copa By Sea. Ate  there this past thursday with 5 friends. AMD must say it was an AMAZING experience... from start to finish. 
We were sat in a comfortable booth  and found everything from the service, the atmosphere, and the menu very well thought out, organized and classy. The food was to die for. Selection, variety and creativity on every plate! To go with the excelent food and atmosphere we enjoyed a bottle of Gavi di Gavi white wine. A night to remember.. and I highly recommend going to Copa  by Sea on the next dinner outing.  Cant  wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, attentive staff, and live dancing. The restaurant consists of an all-you-can-eat buffet, and once you are seated waiters walk around with various meats (mostly steaks) that are simply mouth watering. The service does not stop and it never felt that we were being rushed or kicked out, even on a busy Valentine's Day evening. In fact, we were asked multiple times about whether we had any special requests. Will visit again when in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  So many cuts of meat and they're so delicious.  The Parmasean crusted meats are my fave.  Cornbread and cheese balls are nice to balance all the protein.  Salads and sides are good too. Bit pricey at $50 a person but worth it for a treat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Definitely worth the wait, if you go during weeknights, you'll get more love. 
Have been a regular customer for number of years, and they constantly challenge themselves on how to do better. They innovate and come up with better food for the guests, can't get enough of garlic rib eye (new in 2013), and buttermilk rib eye (new in 2014). 
Must try their cheesy prime rib, anything garlic. My personal favorite is their bacon-wrapped filet mignon (they took out bacon-wrapped turkey... which was another personal favorite). 
Though you might not want to fill-up on their starchy carb options (pasta, potato, fresh baked goodies), they are super tasty. They offer a mean salad bar that's hard to resist!"}
{"text":"Took my dad here as a special treat and we both had an amazing time! We were one of the first customers for dinner and they grilled up some meat and served it just for us and even as they got busier the meat did not stop coming and was perfectly cooked and delicious! The salads were yummy as well and the cheesy bread was a highlight. There is truly something for everyone from lamb chops to rib eye. All the red meats were cooked medium rare to medium with not a single thing overcooked (unlike some other places). Davina, our superb server, made sure we got the cuts of meat we requested and went above and beyond to make our trip special and we could not be happier with the food and service we received! The desserts are to die for too (yummmm the mango and raspberry one was fantastic).

We are looking forward to visiting the seafood place downstairs because we had such a good experience here (10% off within 7 days if you bring your receipt at your next visit :) Sure hope we can find the time to get that 10% off!"}
{"text":"They finally opened! 
If you like meat, visit here; however, there is a risk of bad service. My four star is for the meat.

Below is my detailed experience:

Decor: Modern and good choice of music to keep up with all the servers running around with the knife and the meat (not sure what they are called so I will address them as \"carvers\" to distinguish them from the actual servers who bring you drinks and etc)
The \"carvers\" are extremely busy so watch out for them as they are caring big knives!

Food: the grilled meat and pineapples are excellent. Especially the red meat with parmesan. My hubby loved the parmesan chicken. The bread is really fresh and delicious as well. The salad/side buffet bar was limited. I didn't count all the items but it felt like the one in Eglinton had better selection. So I ended up having very little salad/side. Fyi - this unlimited meal costs $37/person.
Copa is on the upper floor and they also run a sushi restaurant downstairs. So you can order some Japanese food (extra charge) while enjoying your unlimited food at copa. Unfortunately, I was not advised of this so I wasn't able to order any from the sushi place.

Service: Mixed feelings. We got sat at a corner of the restaurant and for 15mins all we got served was water. (No one offered the the sushi menu nor the drink menu. Or spoke of it either)
I asked the hostess to have us moved and she said they were fully booked but will speak with the \"carvers\". We still continued to watch all other adjoining tables get served so we spoke with the manager and he moved us to a better table. After that we had no problem getting any food! Manager came by a few more times to check up. All the \"carvers\" were very nice as well.
When we asked for the bill, our server gave us the bill but said she will come back with the machine for the card.....but never did. Once again, I saw her serve the adjoining tables 10 more times with drinks orders, extra napkin requests, water refill and etc.... we waited 20 mins just waiting and trying to get her attention. At the end, we gave up hope and walked over to the counter and paid ourselves. We still tipped for the bad service from the server assuming the \"carvers\" will be receiving a portion of the tip.
Each server is only responsible for hand full of tables so I don't think it was reasonable for her to have forgotten about us. Plus, the tables are fairly close together.
Lastly, I dropped my gloves in the restaurant and it went missing. Servers and hostess I spoke with told me that they saw them on the floor but yet no one knows where it is. Not sure why they wouldn't have picked it up...strange...
Since they have only been open for a week, I'm going to assume this bad service is temporary until they get their feet wet. I'll try them again another time.
But for now:
A+ for manager and \"carvers\"
F for servers and hostess"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the Vaughan location and I was not disappointed. The meat, both in terms of quality and variety, was phenomenal and the service was fantastic. I had also chosen this location as the place to propose to my girlfriend, and the manager (Slobie) and his team were happy to help. I prearranged a song to be played, for the dancers to present the ring to us and for a bottle of prosseco to be brought out afterwards. Slobie and his staff were fantastic and helped everything go off without a hitch. I've been twice since and it's been equally great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had been to the first incarnation of Copacabana some 5 years ago - the original one  on Eglinton. It was all you can eat meat with a decent salad bar and some pleasant music by a live band in the background. 

Recently, last night actually I visited the reincarnation on Adelaide Street in Downtown Toronto. It was weird to say the least. 

The food is ordinary at best. Surely, there is a poor attempt to sell the place as some sort of a high end establishment with the way the lighting has been arranged; the general decor and the way the servers and waiters interact with the customers. 

I won't go on about waiting for what you asked for or not getting a particular meat - for those can be one off incidents. 

My problems are the following:

1. The environment and general decor is dark with red lighting punctuating the theme; this is more reminiscent of high end strip clubs rather than a restaurant with any degree of minimal class. 

2. The waitresses who seat you and check on you during your meal are more interested in showing off deep cleavages and fake smiles than paying attention to small details like someone requesting a knife or a glass of soda. However, I would not hold it against the waiters per se, because the management seems obsessed with the whole idea of selling the place on the quantity of \"meat\" (including the one for viewing pleasures) rather than any quality. 

3. This leads us to the food itself. It's very ordinary meat at best. Majority of the steaks are dripping with oil as if they were soaked in vegetable oil before being served. The chicken offers some respite but then it's not hard to make and if it's chicken you want - there is better quality and environment to eat at multiple other places. Lamb is hard to mess up and tastes just like lamb grilled at home. The food is not bad if you eat very selectively but the food alone is not worth the price or the compromise that is required. 

4. This leads me to the compromises - your dignity and self-respect (as well as the burden on the wallet). Why do I say that? Perhaps others might find it tasteful, artistic or even entertaining. I for one do not condone the treatment of women as mere objects to be devoured by the eyes of \"hungry\" clients. You see there is a theme here, as mentioned earlier in this review of the idea of selling the unlimited meat feast - this idea is sadly not restricted to food but unfortunately also extends to the silicone filled barely clothed female \"dancers\" as the main event/performance of the evening. The \"dance\" moves were not choreographed for movement with grace, footwork or any other qualifying characteristics of 'dance'. They were rather just to show men what they have to go to the strip clubs for. 

It was quite sad - the whole affair. I was quite embarrassed to say the least and found it distasteful. I was embarrassed to witness the share horror on the faces of unexpected victims - the few scattered families. It was distasteful because I was sold edible meat as well as some for the viewing \"pleasure\". 

In conclusion, I would say it is not for people with refined taste in eating or even a slightly sophisticated taste for general experiences. It is also not suitable for families or dining with your partner. Perhaps, a good substitute for those seeking an alternative to strip clubs with the option of slightly better food. 

I would advise you to save your $75 (average cost per person including gratuities) and have a hearty stake at a specialist instead."}
{"text":"Loved it!  The servers were so friendly and the meats were mouth watering and delicious.  I went as part of a large party and didn't experience the wait times some others have posted about, but perhaps it's because our large group had the top floor booked off for us.

Bad points:  Side buffet downstairs was lackluster.  Hot foods were luke warm, some salad selections were empty or wilted.

Good points: Great dancers, great servers and so much delicious meat that you really don't need to bother with the side dish buffet anyway!  

I'll definitely be heading back for more."}
{"text":"Love the food, place and service . Only reason I am giving 3 is because of all the 15 something variety of meat that should be available, we only got served 4 kinds. They are not consistent in bringing the meat out and miss some tables. So in reality I paid the high price for rice, bread and salad!!"}
{"text":"Pros:
The food was fantastic and the gentlemen walking around with the various steaks and meats were attentive. The dancers were energetic and a ton of fun to watch. A clean, aesthetically pleasing restaurant to dine in. 

Cons:
We saw our waitress a total of 3 times in the 2 hours that we dined there. Once to take our original drink orders, once more to refill our drinks after we bothered another waitress when we were thirsty, and last when we were paying our bill with a different server (perhaps a floor manager?) to \"thank\" us. I don't know about other diners but my husband and I need more than one or two glasses of water to tide us over with that rich of a meal. We try our best to be easy guests but it was a little annoying to sit and watch other tables be tended to all night (other diners seeing their servers 5-9 times in their dining experience) with us sitting there never seeing our server again. I don't know if it was her fault or the restaurant's for stretching her too thin but it was incredibly frustrating. 

For $50 a person (making a two person bill easily $150 with tax and tip), the service was ridiculous. I can go to a bar and spend less than $20 with my husband and get better service and feel more welcome than we did here."}
{"text":"Good things: very extensive salad and sides bar. This is unusual for a Brazilian style meat house.
Bad things: they could offer some simple meats without the cheese stuffing.
Use opentable to make res if going"}
{"text":"There are two locations in TO and I've been to both. For a more casual atmosphere, the Eglinton location is definitely better (their food is also better). 

The Food: You get quite a variety and the meat is cooked quite well. The seasoning is simple, but good. I was really disappointed by the salmon here b/c I originally tried it at the other location (which made it amazingly) and was disappointed by how it was here. The food comes fast, the sides, again, at this location was not as good AND, if you are seated on the second floor, you have to go to floor one to get your food. It was quite annoying.

The Service: Don't have high expectations. This location was better and we were seated more quickly, but overall, the girls are pretentious. The carvers are great. They get their food to you quickly and any requests are quickly handled.

The Atmosphere: this location feels like you're stepping in a club. What with the purple lighting and loud music. For more warmth, you may wish to opt for the other location. The music is really loud, not a place to socialize.

Overall I would go again on those days I feel carnivorous (and for the grilled pineapples)."}
{"text":"Very lacklustre experience. This was my 2nd time eating at this particular restaurant. The first time I didn't know what to expect and how to maximize my experience. However my second recent experience was actually worse. I was happy to pay the expensive prices that they charge but I was expecting far more. The restaurant offers zero quality in addition to their meats! The meat was inconsistent with regards to its quality. Some meats were very chewy and cold and other pieces were warm and delicious. Another thing I did not appreciate is the service. There are some nice staff members but the restaurant's system is a FAIL. They seem to be disorganized. They always come around to your table asking you if you've tasted different meats or ask you what you want. From my understanding, they are supposed to come around to your table with different meats consistently and if you want it then they give it to you. If not, then not. When you did request something it was a lengthy time span for it to arrive. In terms of quantity: This is a buffet! When I ask for more pieces of meat, I should get it! Servers do not like to serve more than 2 pieces of meat at a time and when you ask for more, they give you a piece half the size of your pinky. I don't appreciate to be treated like this as a high paying customer. I definitely wouldn't go back there. I didn't leave this experience impressed and they've lost a customer."}
{"text":"The place has great entertainment and music, normally packed on Friday and Saturday, however making a reservation ahead of time, ensures you don't encounter long wait upon arriving. It's a large Location, with upstairs and down stairs are. Best area, is on the main level.  Great food, remember not to stalk upon on sides, because the meat will full your stomach fast. Eat meats first, then get sides later!"}
{"text":"Went to CopaCabana in Vaughan with my husband and have to say we were both impressed with the food and service! Would definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"First time at this Brazilian restaurant....FIVE star plus...the meat and varieties were delicious   The servers were first class...I'm going to make sure everyone I know aware of this great establishment. Thank you to all of the servers who made our night extremely enjoyable..."}
{"text":"The environment and food makes this place quite unique in Toronto and not something you can find elsewhere.

The meats were cooked perfectly both times I was there: medium rare with a solid char on the outside. I actually didn't think the meats were that salty...However, I stayed away from the buffet and stuck to salad. The service remained prompt and I didn't feel like I couldn't get enough steak.

For the price point I'd say it's worth it. At a normal steakhouse, you'd get a normal steak dish for ~$30-$40 easy. So, $50 doesn't seem that bad for the AYCE (not cheap but not outrageous). If anyone is new in town, I wouldn't hesitate to bring them to Copa."}
{"text":"Get ready for meat sweats! Love the chimichurri. Fresh and plentiful. Staff are excellent and efficient. I do wish they had more chicken options. Pineapple is great."}
{"text":"I'm writing this after my second visit to the restaurant.

First of all, meats are great and they come very often which is a good thing.  Buffet selections is OK but nothing spectacular, wish they add more selections or switch selections weekly or something.  

We were there on friday and they had Brazilian live dance performance and a live DJ, it's a great date night place.

In terms of pricing, it's a little expensive but with unlimited steak, lamb,chicken, pork coming to your table everything 5 minutes, it's also fair I guess."}
{"text":"A must try. Fabulous. Just amazing food and service. Excellent staff, made our night. We went to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday and although we started with an issue with the seating, the manager convinced us to stay promising we won't regret it and fixed our seating and are we ever glad we did. There is nothing that I could complain about. Even the simplest salad was out of this world. The espresso is the best ever. The meats...what can I say? Cooked to perfection like butter in your mouth and the variety is to die for. Best experience ever. The server was a most amazing server and patient, friendly and always smiling. She made our night. Thank you guys so much!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything there, the service, entertainment, the salads and the steak. My fave is the lamb leg."}
{"text":"Really great environment , they come around   With plenty of different types of cooked meat, they have a great selection of buffet appetizer , if you are a meat eater and your partner is vegan you will love it here, there is a DJ playing music and live Brazilian dancers. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Heavenly good steak. Only downside is despite the price for the AYCE Dinner ($38), it doesn't include dessert. Meh, more room to fill up on delicious meats."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. 75 with tax and tip and you get hardly any meat. It's all shaving. It's not cuts of meat. It's gross. The servers cutting the meat I feel so bad for them. They are running around so much. This place seems sexist too. Why is it only men cutting the meat and women I short black dresses serving bread/ hostess. The buffet was random. It was good but the point is the meat. I would not recommend this place or ever come back. It's a total dinning rip off. The show was 10 minutes and it was boring. It's really not something to witness. You can go to eat better places and get more food for cheaper. Save your time and energy"}
{"text":"I was already a bit reluctant to go because I did not like the fact that I had to confirm my reservation twice: The restaurant called in the morning to ask me if I can call them back to confirm my reservation, so I did. Then, 5 hours later, I get a text message again asking to confirm my reservation so I replied to the text as well. When we arrived at the restaurant, I went in with no expectations but I was a bit shocked at the noise level. I understand that it is not the restaurant's fault, but had I known that it was going to be so loud, I would've not chosen this restaurant for date night. It's the kind of place that would be great with a group of friends who are all drinking and being rowdy. I couldn't hear myself think, let alone talk!! 

Compliments to the chefs: the food was really excellent, don't get me wrong, but if we just wanted to have a great meal, we would've just stayed at home and cooked for ourselves. I think that dining out is about the whole experience, including the service, the music, the atmosphere, etc. It's definitely not just about the food. 

The last thing that Copa did that really ticked me off was that I had TWICE made a request for a birthday treat, and the hostess on the phone confirmed that they would be able to bring out a complimentary desert for my date, but when we got to the end of our meal, nothing came. I had also reminded the restaurant of my special request when I replied to the text confirming my reservation, so that was the final straw. 

Do NOT go here for date night!!"}
{"text":"First time here and at any Brazilian steakhouse. We thought the meat was delicious. It was cooked perfectly though some of the selections were a bit salty. Would come back again but not very often as the prices are quite high."}
{"text":"There are definite pros and cons to this place. Pros: great tasting meat, fun entertainment, cordial servers and staff. Cons: all you can eat carb buffet (which most people fall victim to), pricey, overwhelming number of young women dressed in tight low-cleavage dresses, long wait despite reservation. In summary, if you can stay away from the carb buffet, are hanging with a bunch of friends, and don't mind waiting for at least a half hour this place is for you. If you are planning a night out with your bf avoid this restaurant unless you don't mind having his eyes wander."}
{"text":"Overall appearance is appealing, dancers during dinner can get somewhat annoying and the loud music doesn't help.... But it's only for a short moment 

The antipasto bar was basic, but good non the less, great variety of bean salads and cold cuts 

The good thing is once you sit down get ready to eat, waiters are constantly bringing different cuts of meat, the bad thing is the amount of salt they use, every piece of meat was salty as hell, and I like salt 

The actual wait staff (not the ones serving the meat) was terrible, came to our table once in 2 hrs to ask how everything was, we had to go to the bar to order our drinks 

Overall given the location I don't think it'll last long, I would only recommend if you have never had this style of Brazilian Cusine"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday, so we paid the higher price for the dinner service. 

Pros: loves the filet mignon that was stuffed with cheese! So tender and gooey! I remember liking the other cuts also but this particular one stood out. The bread was great also.

Cons: a bit overpriced, but this is coming from someone who doesn't eat a lot so I would have never chosen an all-you-can-eat place. I also think that they could improve on the selection at the cold bar (salads and what not). 

Would come back on a weekday."}
{"text":"Came here for a work event.

The good part is, the food was actually awesome. The salads had a huge variety and were all delicious, the cheese bread was to die for, the meats were super tender and juicy (I was amazed at how well they were able to do ALL of the meats, from the steaks to the chicken to the salmon), and the desserts were amazing as well.

The problem is that we didn't get to eat much of the food. Despite this place advertising itself as really an all-you-can-eat restaurant, some of us left not even full! The waiters came by so erratically and infrequently that half the time we were literally just sitting there trying extremely hard to send telepathic signals for them to bring stuff over. Also, service was not that great. There was a person at our table who didn't eat beef, and someone else who only ate seafood. So you would think that they would make more effort to serve those, right? Nope. The salmon made an appearance once (with much hand waving and asking the staff) and never again.

Keeping in mind that this was paid for by the company, I would most definitely not come here again if I had to fork over more than $50 for the meal."}
{"text":"So much food! Salad/appetizer bar itself is quite amazing on top of all juicy and tender meat. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that this is the first Brazilian steak house I have ever been to.  The different meats and fruits that they brought around were delicious, I especially enjoyed the ones with cheese.  The problem I had with the place was noise.  It was so loud in there but I'm sure the noise and liveliness of the establishment are a draw for some people, I prefer more low key establishments.  I think this place is meant for large groups of friends celebrating something."}
{"text":"The service was pretty bad because my friends and I reserved tables at 9:00 Pm ahead of time so we would be seated by the time we get there since we wanted to surprise our friend for his birthday but we all ended up waiting for about almost an hour for
Our seats. Service was okay, they were pretty sloppy with plating food onto our plates but it was okay cause we understood it was late and busy so they wanted to rush. But at the end of the day when we were ready to pay for our bills, they charged us an extra $80 bucks for something we already paid for and it was their mistake but they still made us pay. Overall it was a mood killer."}
{"text":"Last night was my second time at Copacabana. The place is great! Everything tastes amazing. The meats, the side dishes, all was sooooo good. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is a very interesting take on a traditional churrascaria. Some of the meats are classics (picanha). Others are a bit different from places like Fogo de Chao (cheese stuffed prime rib). Overall a good dining experience with friendly staff and good food. I will say that everything served here is under-seasoned. But, it's always easier to add more salt than take it out. Bottom line a solid churrascaria and I'll be returning on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Booked reservations here for Valentine day dinner and this place was jam packed! We had reservations here for 9 PM and didn't get seated until 9:30- not bad considering that the waiting area was packed with hungry couples- but the point of making a reservation was so that we would have a spot for that time. 

When we finally sat down, I was super excited for the steaks to start coming out- I was practically starving because they were late in giving us our reservation. The chicken and the sausage was the first to arrive and when the steaks arrived, it was a bit too salty. 

I would not recommend coming here on a holiday/\"festive\" day. We did not get to try all of the selections on their menu because they simply either forgot to come around or it was so busy that it was just unorganized.

Overall, what a disappointing experience..."}
{"text":"I visited with my friends to spoil ourselves with Brazilian steaks. I did not know that there was a performance by beautiful ladies. They danced right in front of our table! I couldn't believe my eyes.
When we got some food from the salad bar, servers came one after another with a variety of grilled meats. They gave us so much meat, and everything tasted amazing. The servers were eager to please and were very prompt. We hit the 2-hour limit, but they gave us fresh desserts (deep fried bananas and grilled pineapples) just for us. I was very impressed with the service.
Our dinner cost me quite a bit, but I felt that the overall food and the experience were worth the cost. I would love to come back again."}
{"text":"Pretty fucking awesome. Be ready to eat more than you've ever eaten in life. I give it  ***** on the pig out scale."}
{"text":"Took my husband there for his bday. Absolutely amazing.   Good food and service and while it's expensive - it's worth it."}
{"text":"We had a work meeting so we made a reservation for early dinner for at least 25 of us at this location. First impression was great as we entered we were greeted and taken to our tables. Then came our server who explained on how it all works and took our drinks order.

Its all a buffet style spot with grilled meat coming to your table. They had plenty of choices on the cheese and salad bar. Then came the sides bar which had all sorts of things like various dips, three types of rices, potatoes and it went on. 

The thing I liked was as soon as the first meat server came and found out; me and one other co-worker could only eat salmon, he made a note so we get more of that salmon stops at our table. The salmon was grilled to perfection. 

The restaurant had ample space and was equipped with comfortable seating. The also had plenty of parking.

Overall, very good experience."}
{"text":"Super food super atmosphere very friendly staff  food was very nice you have a huge selection on salads and even pasta and lasagna and many different sauces  and fries so even when someone doesn't like steak u have plenty variety on food :) they bring the meat on screwers and it's up to you if you want it or not. The chicken drumsticks and shrimps I like the most the steaks are good too but sometimes we got it undercooked. The pineapple with cinnamon was the best addition to the meat it balanced the taste.will definitely go soon again the restaurant looks very nice too"}
{"text":"Okay so I would love to give this place 4 stars, but I am bumping to a three only because it's pricey for someone (moi) who doesn't eat a lot of meat. Let me explain.

I came here with coworkers on a Friday night and first thoughts:

D√©cor:

Spiffy and modern! It's a two/three floor complex with buffet stand on the main floor. Now having said this, if you're seated on the top floor, you do have to walk up and down to the buffet area. This is a kind of downer because one of our coworkers called to request a table on the main floor, but alas...

Food:

The salads and buffet offerings were really yummy and perhaps, I should have just chosen to eat that. I believe you can choose the no-meat package which is less expensive. But then again, you know what you're getting into when dining here. The meat was really yummy, but the sliver of pieces they give you are quite thin and small. Rightly so because they don't want you wasting meat. But for me who could only handle \"one-round\" of trying all the various meats, I was stuffed. So I really had like 8 different cuts and two vegetable plates. That was $50 not including tips and drinks.

Special mention to the \"dessert\" - the grilled pineapple and the corn bread. I could have just eaten that corn bread all night long.

Bathroom situation:

Yup, this needs a paragraph all on its own. The top floor (and it's a big floor) only has two bathrooms for the ladies. I don't know how many more can be found downstairs, but be warned. There is a lot of walking up and down to get to things.

Show:

Yeah, there are Brazilian dancers with shiny and fancy costumes that come and swivel/and shake hips. There is also a swinger who swings up and down a cloth rope by the stairs. Once you've seen it all...

So overall, I think this is a GREAT place gathering for groups, parties, bachelorettes, whatever. It's loud and rowdy. But I think for a regular dinner, you can go somewhere else. Reservations HIGHLY recommended as when we left (about 8-ish) the line was extending outside."}
{"text":"The food was good, but it was just way too hot in there. It was extremely uncomfortable and made the eating experience less enjoyable.

Also, being seated upstairs was a logistical nightmare, with the salad bar being downstairs..."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and I've always thought the food was top notch! I've seen a lot of complaints about salty food and can't agree! 

I've recently has the all you can eat seafood which my family and I really enjoyed. Giant seared scallops... Endless varieties of fish dishes.... Skewers of garlic shrimp... Even a delicious lobster Mac and cheese which had good chunks of lobster in it! It exceeded my expectations. 
 
We also went in expecting bad service due to the reviews... It's always good to keep your expectations low! 

We had a waitress which was a numb nut... But many other people helped us as well and overall we were happy with the service. They constantly brought more grilled items around and always asked us if there was anything we wanted to request more of. 
As usual I tend to over fill on grilled pineapple but every bite is worth it!

Meat vs seafood? 
I love them both. Depends what you're in the mood for. The seafood doesn't feel as heavy by the end of it. But the meat has a better salad bar. The seafood has more a la carte items which you order off the menu such as assorted ceviches, lobster Mac and cheese (as mentioned), grilled fish, calamari (grilled and fried), coconut shrimp... There are also oyster and crab leg platters for additional cost."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good, our waitress was friendly and made sure our waters were filled throughout the night. The meat servers were quick and came around often which gave us the chance to try most of the meat offerings. 

As for the food, the meat was cooked perfectly (though the boyfriend found the meat to be a bit too pink lol). We really enjoyed all the beef cuts (especially the parmesan stuffed one!) and the buttermilk chicken, which was super tender, juicy and had a super crispy skin. Only downside was everything was wayyyy too salty, which kind of put us off from eating anymore than we could. The buffet table was pretty nice with a wide array of salads and sides. 

One thing that really irked us was the way the servers at the buffet bar would passive aggressively shove the ladels/tongs back into the bowls after we grabbed what we wanted. We understood perhaps they wanted to keep things tidy, just found it a bit rude.

Overall Copacabana was a great experience! Do come on the weekend for the entertaining samba dancers!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some of the other reviews here.   The service has always been great anytime I've gone here.  At times it's been jam packed, and at times it's been almost empty.  

The meat is incredible. So delicious.  Usually so many servers come by it's hard for me to keep up with all the meat choices.

Drinks are good - love the blue abacaxi.

Dancers are fun if you go on a weekend.

The salad bar and other food from the buffet are also very delicious.

Not a cheap place. Just over $50 a person.

But this has become one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"I had a horrible time at the Eglinton location a few years back. My fiancee was dying for some Brazilian Steakhouse and we were elated that there was a new location to give another try to. I was thoroughly impressed! We went at 4:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday so it was not busy at all... But there was absolutely zero issues with the meats, hot table, salad bar or the service. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We dined here in a group of 6 on a Tuesday night. The atmosphere is super modern and comfortable! We were waited on quickly and got right down to eating. :)

I loved the cheese-stuffed prime rib, top sirloin, bacon wrapped filet mignon, garlic steak... Sooo tasty and juicy!! And the salad bar was even tastier than other Copacabana restaurants I've been to (eg. the mashed potatoes are the fluffiest I've ever had). Make sure to order some freshly baked corn bread for your table!

The service was very attentive. Numerous times servers asked us if everything was good and if we had any requests. At one point, a member of our party turned down some top sirloin because she prefers it well done, and several minutes later the server came back with a well done piece cooked just for her! (How nice!) 

Overall it was a great (and delicious) experience and I can't wait to go again! 

P.S. I'll note that the restaurant may be a little difficult to find, as it's in an industrial area and the sign is hard to see at night. The front patio of the restaurant is still under construction. If you get lost, look for the number 205."}
{"text":"Love everything about Copa, the food, the entertainment, and the service was all great! The price is a little steep but definitely worth it with the quality of the food and the amount of food we ate.

My favourites were the filet mignon wrapped in bacon, the salmon, and the pineapple. The Moroccan chicken was also delicious. Note that the garlic sirloin steak is very garlicy and anything with parmesan is also very parm-y and has a smell!

Would definitely come back but only for special occasions."}
{"text":"My family celebrates all our occasions here. We have always had between 6-15 guests here for dinner and we only book on days when there is a dance performance (Fridays and Saturdays, I believe).

The selection for the all you can eat meat is phenomenal and cooked perfectly. We have never had to wait for the servers to come to our table because they are very attentive (and are good eye candy LOL). The buffet has a pretty good selection (medium size) with many salads, fresh breads, rice, lasagna, and cheeses. 

The performance is entertaining and well worth the price you pay. The d√©cor is modern. I always recommend Copa to others."}
{"text":"If I could I'd give 1.5* and the 1.5 goes to the meat, 0 for service, 0 for environment, 0 for experience, 0 for pricing. 

Downtown Toronto location is much better than Vaughan. 

I planned a surprise party for my boyfriend since mid May for end of June. From then till now I believe we had 3 emails and at least 8 calls to ensuring everything is correct. They said a contract needed to be sign with credit card number given and $10 deposit per person for holding a party/table more than 8 people. Understandable. My party was 22 people* 
On day before party, my boyfriend's last name is still spelt wrong! 

From May till the actual party, things still doesn't go right. I said it is a surprise for a reason and when we arrive, the male in suit standing at the front and asked for our reservation. After I told him, he said \"oh they're right there in the middle\". I was surprised because it was a surprise for my boyfriend and right off the bat you told him, there you go, right there. No waiter or waitress even walk us in. 

General environment was family friendly. Salad bar was small and limited selections. 

**Our server was rude from beginning till moment we leave. I sat down and nicely reminded her that I brought a cake in and it was homemade so I must get the cake carrier back. She said \"sorry we don't have anything like that'. I\"m like of course you do, cause the cake was brought in and in the fridge at your restaurant right now. Then she rolled her eyes and said \"ok, if it's yours you'll get it back\". I was shocked with the manner and asked my friend (in front of her while she's taking orders for drinks) if she was giving me attitude and she looked at me. 

The restaurant wasn't full that night, for sure no one was waiting at the reception area for a table. There was still empty tables. 

We didn't get serve with variety of meat and even though we sat right where the kitchen is, the servers come to our tables very slow and it is the same meat over and over again. (Where as Downtown, Toronto location they had a variety of meat available, fish, shrimp and tons of salad selections). Vaughan, you need to ask for everything (even a fork takes 10mins to come). 

**Not everyone was full (boys were still waiting on meat) and the waitress kept rushing us and asking if we're done and start taking our plates and utensils away. Well what if I still want salad? (we had to ask for forks again) 

**Waitress brought out the cake at the end, given that I assume she had enough with us. After blowing the candle of the cake, we asked for a knife to cut the cake. She came by with a knife and took the cake away and cut it immediately. Everyone stood there with cameras were shocked. Like.... isn't the birthday person suppose to blow the candle and take the first cut? Rudest thing was, she didn't ask. She came and took it away and start cutting while one of her co-worker starts passing her plate and another co-worker standing there (three in a row) holding onto the card machine for payment. 

Completely a disaster for planning party there. I wouldn't even go here for normal dinner. 

Though 22 people isn't a lot of money, $50/pp + tax + 15% gratuity on top for party 6+ but with this kind of service and attitude and rushing, I would never step foot back here again or will I give them a second chance! EXTREMELY TERRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Unreal spot. The food here is delicious. From the salad bar on the main floor to the servers walking around with meat and seafood on skewers. The dancing entertainment that they have on the weekends are also excellent and lots of fun!"}
{"text":"Guys night out, what better way to do it than an all you can eat meat fest. Our group of 7 made reservations for 7pm on Saturday night to help send off a good friend before he gets married in a couple of weeks.

I had only been to the Yonge and Eglington location before and upon entering this newer Financial meets Entertainment district location I was wow'd from the moment we walked in. 2-3 floors of seating, a design that melds the pretentiousness of the area with some modern Brazilian design elements (that and some cool lighting). It was a far cry from the more humble location to the city's north. 

The grooms brother/best man called weeks in advance and asked to make sure we had sufficient room for as many as 15, but due to some last minute cancellations changed the reservation to 7 people, far easier to manage from the restaurants stand point but still a sizable booking considering the full rodizio service comes in at $50 a pop.

The issue out the gate is they tried to cram our party of 7 into a corner table that only seated 6. Even if we could have squeezed one extra person on it, it wouldn't have been a very comfortable experience for anyone at the table. We rejected the table on principle and common sense. This then forced us to have to wait 45 minutes for another table, and with no where to go (as all bar seats are taken up by diners) we felt jilted to say the least.

We flagged someone who appeared to be a floor manager and complained about how a 7pm reso could be so badly messed up. She did her best to compensate us by offering to pay for a round of shots which was nice, but when you're hungry and watching everyone else eat, booze isn't going to help, it's only going to make you more hungry...and it did.

Once we were finally seated, the feasting could properly begin. I think they knew we were all a little miffed thus far so they must have made sure to hit us with every possible meat possible, we were getting steak and chicken and lamb back to back to back so often that some of us had to take a time out. I will have to agree with Calvin S's review as I did notice a wider more flavorful selection than was offered at the other location.

Once we'd been fed a few rounds, tensions eased while bellies expanded and we ended up getting along with our server much better, even joking here and there. 

The shows were great, while dining we got to see two different Brazilian dances and an aerial acrobat hanging like a chandelier above the curved staircase. Pretty fancy if you ask me.

I decided as well to sample their cocktails and while the old fashioned was passible, a little heavy on the brown sugar, the Sangria was more spirit forward than wine forward than I would have liked. However, given the location, they put forth a valiant effort.

I'll knock off 1 star for the rough start and 0.5 star for the cocktails as they weren't bad, just in need of some tweaking and land on a 3.5 over all for this review. Would I be back, definitely. The pageantry and meat selection alone are totally worth the experience.

{"text":"Meat meat meat!!! yes, if you love meat this is the place for you.  Endless portion of meat in different varieties.  Mind they do have a salad bar but I didn't bother checking it out as I was swarm by all the server carrying the meats to my plate.  There was also a Brazilain dancer performing as we went on the weekend.  I enjoyed most of the meat I got but I loved the grilled pineapple so much I had to ask them to keep bringing me more."}
{"text":"Great food, service was quick. The steak and quality of food was amazing for a busy Saturday night. Servers were attentive and asked if we had any requests. Salad bar was a bit lacking though. Pricey but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"10/10 would recommend!!! 

If you've never been here before...it is THE PLACE to come (if you're a meat lover). I would come on a Friday or weekend just because you get the entire experience. The performers that come on while you're enjoying your meal are great and entertaining! The waiters are also really nice and they tell you exactly what they're bringing you! Make sure you try absolutely everything and though their salad/appetizer bar is also decked out and awesome, you definitely want to leave room for all the meat you're about to devour."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the atmosphere of this place and the variety of meats they serve! However I've been with both small and large groups and have noticed that with small groups the servers will tend to stop coming to your table before you've said you're finished. I do appreciate how they come to your table and ask if you have any requests!"}
{"text":"Come hungry.

To be honest, if you're a vegetarian, vegan, or even just not a big meat eater than this place might not be for you.

The way that it works is you basically get a 2 sided card for each person at the table and you choose one side (usually green or blue) or the other (red) which will tell the servers to come to your table, or to give you a break.

They'll come out with 10+ different kinds of steak or chicken and sometimes also lamb and salmon and they bring it to you fresh, right on the rotisserie spit and slice it off for you.  They even have meat stuffed with cheese!

The food's amazing, though I wouldn't recommend bothering with the salad bar, since you will need room for all the meat - which is really by far the best thing they serve.

I've always had great service and attentive wait staff and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Grilled pineapple!!! You're welcome! 
I've been here twice. One time it was great but it wasn't very busy and they were slow to come around with the meat. 2nd time was the best maybe because I mentioned it was my son and my birthday? But they were really fast and accommodating to our request for more grilled pineapple lol the server also brought my son a bday dessert she was very sweet. It's expensive so we only come for special occasions and during the week lol"}
{"text":"JUST DONT! Unless you love super salty & overly seasoned meat! They also kept bringing the SAME 3 options over and over...terrible. Wish I could give it a 0 star rating!"}
{"text":"The first time I went there it was great, second time was mediocre and the third time makes me never want to go back again. 

Do not go there if you're not fluent in English or senior because the guys that cut the meat for you will be rude or just not come to your table.

Also if it is your birthday you should get a free meal with an ID plus three other guests. But you need to double check the bill and remind the waitress because they would still charge you."}
{"text":"Went out for a special birthday celebration on a Saturday evening. The restaurant has a trendy atmosphere with upbeat music, not so loud as you can't talk though. Thought we would be able to see some of the dancers or other live entertainment they supposedly have but we didn't see any during the time we were there. 

With regard to the food, the salad bar/side dishes were so so. The salads were fresh and well prepared with lots to choose from, however, the side dishes, mashed potatoes, grilled vegetables, lasagna, and pasta penne were all cold and not appealing. The bread station was weird in that you couldn't cut your own bread and there wasn't any precut that you could just take, you had to wait for a server to cut you a piece. The servers time to cut the bread individually may have been better spent seeing that the side dishes were hot.  The meats on the skewers were very good with a selection of lamb, prime rib with cheese, sirloin, Mediterranean chicken and shrimp. The presentation of the dishes was however, hit and miss. Ended up trying to be served the same thing a number of times and then at the end of our meal they brought out different items. As well, we were informed that when you had your red/blue table card with the red side up it meant that you didn't want to be served by the gauchos and if it was on green that they were to serve you when they came by your table. Well it doesn't seem to matter if you have your card on red and don't want to be disturbed or not, they stop and interrupt anyway. So that there as a bit of an annoyance.

Also, they didn't seem to have any desert other than the grilled pineapple, so if you don't like pineapple, nothing for you!

All in all it was kind of a interesting dining experience but would have been nicer with attention to details."}
{"text":"This place tries too hard to be trendy and completely falls short in what it's supposed to do: provide a carnivorous experience.

The meat carvers came by very slowly and most of the time you were getting a cut of meat covered in some sort of cheese.  I do like cheese, but this can get very quickly overwhelming.  The meats were salty even by Brazilian steakhouse standards (at one point, I was actually tasting pure salt crystals).  Four of us in our party were still hungry and wanted more meat, but no one came by for 25 minutes, until we eventually called the waiter and told him we weren't done (cause they're too classy to use the green and red signs like every other place).  Even after this, we only got two more rounds of meat service.  There were certain items we could see being served in the restaurant that never even made it to our table.

A couple of other notes that really sunk this place into the ground:
1. We were charged for water.  $1 per person.  Totally random, and not a big deal, but no one told us upfront.  I feel like this isn't a make or break in their profit margin, so don't know why they'd do this.
2. We ordered a specific bottle of wine and then were later charged for a more expensive bottle.  The server explained this simply as \"oh I couldn't hear you\"
3. They apparently had no system of record keeping on if you'd paid for your meal.  After we ate, they chased us out of the restaurant saying we hadn't paid all our bills.  It was only after my friend found the payment receipt on the table they believed us and let us go.

Overall, would rank at the absolute bottom of Brazillian steakhouse experiences."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of copa since they opened downtown and am pleased to see another open up in the Woodbridge area. Actually booked this restaurant for a private dinner for my wedding earlier in the year and had great service, food and communication with the manager for my event. Been there twice since with friends and was not disappointed, the food is great, though I wish they changed it up every once and a while I've been dining at copa for a few years and I don't think they e changed anything on the menu. But the variety you get is still delicious, personally I love any of the steak cuts with cheese! Not a fan of the piripiri as it kind of just tastes like steak in green salsa. Lots of good food coming around though. Decent side buffet, the mac and cheese is not very good but it's more of an incentive to eat as much steak as you can handle. Very busy at dinner time like the other locations, I would definitely try and book ahead to reserve a spot on busy nights/ times."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday and it was pretty busy. Sunday 
- Thursday $47
- Friday and Saturday $52

Pros:
- Cinamon pineapple is tasty. 

Cons: 
- We were a party of 8 and they BARELY ever came to us with steak. We literally had to wave them over.
- They kick you out after 2h.

Would NOT recommend. The one on Yonge and Eglinton is MUCH better."}
{"text":"We went last night for Valentine's Day dinner!! All I can say is this place is so unprofessional and have horrible customer service.... With the exception of the hostesses at the front door, they actually were nice and courteous with us! We made reservations 2 weeks prior and we had to give a credit card and sign a paper stating that we would be confirming our reservation and that if we didn't attend that the credit card would be charged due to the size of our group. So we all understood that and agreed. So when we got there we were there earlier than our check in time of 10pm so they walked us up to the bar, so 10 pm came around and our table still wasn't ready and so they said to wait 10-15 more mins as for the people were paying and than 10:30 came by and still no table. We spoke to the manager and he was so arrogate and really didn't help out at all, seemed like he didn't care about the situation or our business. We spoke to another employee there and she was looking at her iPad to check the time and reservation AGAIN and said AGAIN to wait another 10 mins our table was being set up.... Mind you at this point everyone is standing around and starving in our waiting time we saw 3 of the shows and still nothing now 11 pm comes around and the same thing still nothing so now everyone is pissed including myself. The stuck up manager didn't care, so as our group become smaller cause some of us were too annoyed and disappointed they left to eat at any other local restaurant. So at this point we went to the manager and told him that this was ridiculous and so poor in character from his part on not making any attempt to trying to figure something out, we made sure he removed our credit card and as were leaving on of the other managers said oh no please don't leave some tables are clearing up we said you have to be kidding us now your concerned and want our business!! The nerve I will give her that she did seem that she was upset for our experience and wanted to help out! Too bad that we couldn't experience this place, NEVER going back there again!!! I will try out the other locations instead!! Be warned about this location!!! To JOHN the manager there learn to have have some respect for others and customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of seven guys to kick off our night. I had made reservations weeks ahead of time online, and the restaurant even called to confirm our reservation that morning (which I confirmed) for 7:30 p.m. Great. We got to the restaurant around 7:35 p.m., and one of our guests was already present. We were told that we'd have to wait a short bit and that our table was being prepared. 

45 minutes. That's how long we waited before we got our table. Absolutely unacceptable. We followed up with the hosts multiple times but we got the same stonewalling each and every single time. \"Your table is being cleaned\" \"There's a party there right now and they're wrapping up\" \"Almost ready\". I get that it was a busy Friday night, but you cannot make your guests (who had reservations) wait 45 minutes for their table. Someone dropped the ball here.

When we were finally seated, the food started coming. For the first 20-30 minutes though, it was the same skewers of meat coming to us over and over again. We were asked if we wanted the leg of lamb about three times in the first 20 minutes. I also found the meat to be extremely salty for the most part, and ended up chugging a lot of water through the night. The pineapple was good though, but honestly the meat was not memorable for the most part. I'm also not sure we got every single cut of meat that they advertise online.

To top it off, our bills also came with a mandatory service charge. It's an expensive dinner for a not-so-great experience. You're better off spending this sort of money at an actual steakhouse for a better time and better food. Congratulations Copa, you're my first one star review."}
{"text":"Changed the way my taste buds experience food. The food was phenomenal. Standard foods that you wouldn't expect to be amazing like salad, broccoli,  cornbread, and pineapple are out of this world. Regarding the meat: everything was perfect except for the parmesan coated meats. Not a huge fan of parmesan. 

Pros: Taste was AMAZING, service was great, nice atmosphere.

Cons: Parmesan meat (this is subjective I guess), price. Like it's super expensive. Super. Hey but birthdays are free so go with your girlfriend on your birthday and tell her you're paying for everything LOL.

Reccomendations: Everything they bring to the table. Pay attention to the non-metal that are delivered too like the grilled pineapple, crusted bananas, cornbread.

The 4 stars is just because of the price, but don't get me wrong: it's completely worth it."}
{"text":"Great service, ambiance was nice, food was amazing. As someone who has been to Brazil, I would say this definitely compares to what you'll find in rio and south of the country (and even exceeds the average quality)."}
{"text":"The best steak I have ever had, hands down. Fantastic variety, melts in your mouth, makes me salivate just thinking about it. The parmesan filet, cheddar prime rib and dry rub flank steak are so good I want to eat the entire skewer of each every day of my life.

Service has always been great in the 5-6 times I have gone. The food keeps coming all night. The show is fun to watch.

Love this place and will continue to frequent it.

*Slightly trendier than the Eglinton location and I find the food a bit better as well."}
{"text":"Went to a beloved colleague's retirement party here for dinner, a party of 12. We had not even finished eating and they told us all to leave. It was painful. Maybe we were too old. I will never forgive you COPA SHIT ON A STICK CABANA."}
{"text":"the food was really tasty and the sushi was great! I'll be coming back as soon as i digest all this food I eat :D"}
{"text":"This is a lovely location for a nice night out or for a celebration! I love how they have both a lovely buffet and servers circulating with meat which they slide off fresh for you! Ah-maaaaazing! They have a few sections you can sit at the better if the two is definitely the one on the main bediase that's where the buffet tables are at. It is a little \"cozy\" but you never feel too cramped. Their  speciality drinks are delicious but quite expensive. Food wize- it your a meat eater you get a good bang for your buck because it's unlimited specialty meats. Fave- Parmesan stuff steak-YUM! 
Verdict- id come back on a special occasion but not  regular evening of dining out."}
{"text":"Copacabana is the best AYCE steakhouse in Toronto. Take that with a grain of salt as there's only 3 in Toronto.

The downtown location is newer, larger and better looking than the Eglinton and Yonge location. Of course thats what they tell you when they charge you $10 more than the midtown location. (Tip: If you're going with family or prefer more lowkey, go to the Eglinton and Yonge one. Downtown's vibe is much more extravagant)

\"Copa\" is the ultimate feast in a boy's night out. It's got all the steak you can eat, half naked girls dancing (Weekends only) and a good selection in drinks. I won't list all the selection of meats available, it's on their website, but know that their Top Sirloin is amazing. When they come by and offer you cornbread, you're going to want to scoff at them offering you bread, but trust me and take one. Take a bite of that delicious cornbread and you'll understand why they dare offer it. It tastes amazing. 

Some common complaints is that the meat is salty and the service really can be slow. I agree with both. I remember that we once went past the two hour limit, but after speaking with the manager, our table quickly got the steaks that we requested, and stayed for an extra half hour until we were ready to leave. The steaks really are salty after a while. Very salty. So make sure to get some amazing grilled pineapple to cleanse your taste buds.

Again, this place is a definitely must try. At least once. Come on your birthday and it's free for the birthday boy/gal. (minimum party of 4)"}
{"text":"The food was good. The music too loud and they didn't seat us at our reservation time even though we arrived early for it. We were sat 23 minutes after our reservation time. 

The prime rib with cheese was really great."}
{"text":"I went with a group from school to eat here, so we all paid a flat rate to our organizer. The food was great, however, Brazilian food just isn't my favourite. The place looks really fancy with a lot of great performers and lively music, plus personal catering by staff carrying around meat and other goods. There is also the self-serve table with a lot of great salads, seafood, and other treats. Service was friendly, but the food just isn't my favourite type. It is quite an expensive restaurant to be regularly eating at."}
{"text":"I been this restaurant twice, it is a \"all you can eat\" style Brazilian restaurant. however the same thing happen for both of the time I came.

When you hear the word \"all you can eat\", don't think you gonna get very full here. The meat carvers service too slow. Most the time you are eating their cold dish and salad buffet. When you been sitting for already 1.5hrs-2hrs, the meat carvers getting more slower.....you may need to wait for 20-25mins for a round of meat.  But the waitresses are already trying to ask you for the bill. Because they have more people waiting .....

I was with my boyfriend and few guys together, when we left, most of them feel like not really full and they still can eat more."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, the service and the atmosphere. I will be back. Buffet with all you can eat steak, shrimp, chicken all served to you at your table non stop til you say enough!
A salad bar and wide selection of fresh sides and breads. I have read the reviews and I can tell you that this is an amazing experience and worth a try. Highly recommend reservations and plan on at least 1.5 hours of good steady tasting.
 deep fried Bananas and BarBQ Pineapple were very tasty.
Enjoyable and very tasty."}
{"text":"Took my mom there for her 65th birthday.  We got up to get our side dishes from the salad bar and as I was placing the mashed potatoes on my plate (the very first item on my plate), one of the line cooks named Armando told me \"don't play with the food\".  My mother asked me what he said and when I told her she walked over to tell him I wasn't playing with the food.  He then proceeded to speak to her in a very condescending and inappropriate tone.  I then stepped in to tell him 1) don't speak to my mother in that fashion 2) once again I was not \"playing with the food\" 3) that you don't get to speak to people in that manner and to fix his attitude.  It's interesting that if I was indeed playing with the food, why did he just \"pretty up\" the mashed potatoes remaining in the pot speak to me OVER the open pot of food and then close the lid?  Why didn't he remove the potatoes that I \"played\" in?  The manager approached to ask what was going on and when I explained to her what Armando had said, she told me that \"I'm sure he didn't mean it like that\" and said she was so sorry and that she would speak to him.  I told her that it was my mother's birthday and that I didn't appreciate the way he had spoken to her and that his customer service skills were atrocious.  The food itself was fine, our server was great.  The manager later came over to our table and apologized again and said that because of what happened and since it was my mom's birthday, our dessert would be on the house.  Nice gesture, but for that disgusting altercation with the line cook, a free dessert (which any decent restaurant offers when you mention it's someone's birthday) does nothing to show how sorry they were for his actions.  Both my mother and I will never eat at that location again.  Customer service is non existent."}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean environment, good service
Can't ask for much more! 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So I struggled a bit with this review, it is definitely good as it hits all the basic marks of a brazilian steakhouse. However, I have made quite a few visits and I would say the consistency is just not quite there from one visit to another. Sometimes the meat can be more salty than others, the wait staff is very hit and miss, and quality is just OK. I just think for the price point it is now at there are better options out there now but hey if you want all you can eat meat this will satisfy that craving for sure.

On a side note, I tried the seafood version they have (when prices were much lower to drive people in) and it was really good. You feel much better after the meal as everything is lighter, but again that was at a lower price point, where it is at now it is debatable whether the value is there."}
{"text":"I regressed into a caveman/humanoid on the Darwinian evolutionary scale as my back hunched over and my adult brain shut off its linguistic functions in order to repeat \"cheese steak,\" and \"pineapple\" and \"yes please\" for about an hour. I ate. And ate. Thank you Copacabana for being delicious. Here is a pretty good review for you. Now get back to work and keep cooking so people can experience the glorious, glorious, light you bring to the world."}
{"text":"Sides were delicious - meat was tender. Sadly I didn't get to try everything ( no bacon wrapped filet ) we kept getting the same boring meats come around to our large table of 12

 carvers didn't tell you what they had unless you asked - although it's so loud & busy on a sat night I understand why they're in a hurry. 

Service was okay though they don't really do much other than take the drink orders. 
Dancers are very cool

Mojito was pretty average a little flavorless but not a bad price at 9$ definitely didn't want a second one 

They handled split bills for the party well. I appreciated that. Autograt is fine with me too but I didn't really feel like giving anything extra (as I normally would for excellent service) 
This meat place was okay for the money but I was expecting more from the hype.
I could think of many 45$ steaks I would go for before I went here again."}
{"text":"Went for a visit tonight and I've gotta tell you, it was the best night out in awhile! Good crowd, made reservations for 9pm and we saw two performances which were great! Good date night spot or birthday crowd, I found them to be very accommodating for the birthday tables, which was nice. The food was excellent, something for everyone! The meat was great, it was flavourful and came out hot! The guys with the meat were working the tables so well. Yummy pineapple and deep fried bananas too. 
Thank you to the floor manager who came by to ask about our experience, I respect and appreciate restaurants who care. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place Never disappoints in their meat and salad selection! I go there for all my special events!"}
{"text":"We were here with my two other friends, aside from the fact that they list different meats but serve you only 5 or 6 types gives you this feeling that you are ripped off. Moreover, I saw the servers just look at you and pass by to serve new customers who are coming in large numbers. I won't recommend this place if you are a few people going there to socialize."}
{"text":"The steak and chicken is so good here. However we didn't catch the Brazilian dance this time we visit, it only available at dinner on weekends. All severs here are very good looking and cool :) the bar upstairs looks very good, will come and try next time."}
{"text":"If possible I would split my rating between food and service. 

Food 4 stars, service 2 stars. And heres why:

We were a party of 19 people who attended a birthday at the adelaide location on a saturday night. It was a very busy night, I will grant the location this. 

1. Check in- even though there were multiple staff members at the hostess booth no one greeted us or told us where our table was or how things were going to work. A member of the group herded everyone upstairs and explained the self coat check to us all. 

2. After being seated it took a very long time for us to get a server to come by. Once orders had been placed it took between 30-40 minutes for drinks to make their way to us. Also it was very very warm in the space and many of us had to step out for fresh air periodically.

3. Meats- the meats were delicious! However, no one explained the ordering to us and we finally flagged down a random server who told us how it worked and again a member of the group had to go around to both tables explaining how to order. 

4. Also, the buffet is on the main floor while we were seated on the top floor. Trying to dodge people, dancers and servers on the staircase while balancing plates of food in a large group was extremely difficult. And NONE of the stairs have carpeting on them which makes them very slick. A few members of the group slipped and fell including people wearing flats. 

5. And with that we come to the big NO'NO part of this review. Again the uncarpeted stairs at the entrance got slick after a rainy day. I was wearing kitten heels and ended up slipping and falling down a whole flight of stairs. The worst part was this was right next to the hostess booth and not a single employee came to check to see what had happened! Instead a bunch of random guests came to help me up and walked me to some seating while I got my bearings. My entire left hip and thigh area has been swollen and bruised for over 10 days from the fall. 

6. During the meal we asked our food filled plates be left while we stepped out to greet some late comers to the party. When we got back our plates and cutlery had been cleared. And when servers hadn't come around after 20 minutes a member of the party went to the cutlery station and grabbed us some forks and knives out of an unattended cutlery crate.

7. There's no menu, so we had no idea if we even got everything on offer. It was very random and totally depended on who we flagged down as they walked past us. Also we got the grilled pineapple (to die for btws!) before we got any seafood. So many of us had had desert and thought the meal was over when we saw other group members get served more food. 

8. There was also some confusion with the bill and when we asked for a reason the server was extremely curt. Many of the guests were upset over the general behaviour of the server. Considering the built in almost 20% gratuity, myself and multiple members of the group felt jipped as far as customer service was concerned. 

At a cost of almost a $100/person the general consensus was that though the food and entertainment was excellent, the lack of care when it came to customer service would be the reason many of us would not return to this location."}
{"text":"My favorite place in town.. We always go on a weekend, so it's always busy but that has no bearing on how efficient and attentive the servers are.. They are amazing! Would recommend this place to anyone.. The salad collection in the Adelaide location was much more interesting than the one on eglinton!"}
{"text":"I'm a little bit torn to review Copacabana. Here's why.

PROS
- different type of meats;
- quality of the meat is pretty good;
- great choice of salads (and I'm not a salad guy): only one type of romain (which is the cheapest to find on the market) all the other greens are kale based which is healthier and more expensive if we go get it at the store;
- good variety of sides;
- definitely the price is very good for what you get especially when compared to the overrated and overpriced most famous chain-steakhouse;

CONS
- the Brazilian steakhouse generally don't come to the table keep asking \"do you like some of this meat sir/madam?\" they just cut it or walking away based on what the card/dice says (green color, you want more - red color, you are taking a break).
This is the whole purpose of having cards/dice on the table; so that you don't have to be interrupted/constantly to be asked what you like.
- the Picana (top sirloin), the most famous steak when you do have a Brazilian BBQ, doesn't come as often as you expect. In the 2-3 hours we were there, I saw Picana being offered at the table only 3 times (and mind though, they hurried to drop a little piece on your side plate to move away).
- the waiting time before being seated: we booked for 8.00pm and we got at 8.32pm. 

Overall, the food I had, I got to admit, beaten my expectations, I swear. I wasn't expecting all this, especially knowing how a Brazilian BBQ is (have several Brazilian friends and we often BBQ at home and they make sure to do things like they do back home).
So yes, here you it's not too bad in the end.

I think that if management will work out better ways to \"fix\" the things I have highlighted in my CONS, this place could easily be rated with a 4 stars.

So, I believe I will come back again to see if my first experience here was just a one off or if this is really the standard for this chain (they also have 4 other locations: east of Yonge and Eglinton, Niagara Falls and Vaughan)."}
{"text":"I found the meats to be super salty, especially the Parmesan chicken which I really couldn't swallow. Service was slow in the beginning but quickly picked up and they were willing to grill and bring you whatever you asked for which is greatly appreciated. I found the music just a bit too loud it was hard to have a conversation without shouting as other people were also shouting in their respective tables. Most likely won't be back again..."}
{"text":"Lamb chops are great! Be sure to ask for them again and again. Beef with cheese is delicious. Salad bar and the sides are \"ok\". They don't replenish popular ones like the sweet potato fries. 

Servers are attentive but you may not get what you want for a long time."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars for the atmosphere and 4 stars on the food. Definitely try to get a reservation here, because if you get here after 730 on a Friday, you're going to be waiting a while. Try to get here before 7pm or 9pm, because that's when they have the Brazilian dancers out.

Food: 4.5 stars for the meat; 3.5 stars for the salad bar

My favorites were the top sirloin, garlic sirloin, and filet mignon with cheese. All the other beefs and lamb were pretty good as well. The one thing that bugged me was the \"signature\" steak. It was the most bland of all the meats but it was overly hyped. Special mention to the teriyaki salmon, which was surprisingly very good. Meat quality was good but I would say it's a tad below Fogo de Chao in the US. Salad bar was decent. I grabbed a bunch of the salads and mashed potatoes. Disappointed that I didn't see any fried bananas, and the hummus was kind of bad.

Atmosphere: 5 stars for the ambiance, entertainment, and service

I really loved the whole experience here. The restaurant had a cool, modern design. There was a DJ bumping music and the Maple Leafs game was on (they lost unfortunately). And it was generally a young professional crowd the night we went. 

They also had a cool Brazilian Carnival dance show at 7pm and 9pm. Dancers were really talented and there was even one who was performing Cirque du Soleil moves. 

Really don't have any complaints about this place. Food was good and it was a fun and unique dining experience. Expect a loud atmosphere if you're coming here. Great for dates and large parties."}
{"text":"I have to begin with the host, I'm not sure if she was tired because it was almost closing time or if she was drunk, but she was scared when she saw us at the door and she said \"OMG you scared me! I hate when you guys do that\". She sat us at a table and left, forever! It was the first time we where there so we didn't know if we where supposed to get up and help ourselves or wait for a waitress. 5 min later I had to ask one of the waitress how does it work and she brought us another waitress to explain how it works and everything started to get better.

You're supposed to get up and serve yourself with a variety of salads, fruits, breads, cheeses, and more stuff. Everything I chose was just ok.

After about 15 min, the meat start coming. You can choose if you want it or not. Meat was really good! It reminded me of Argentinian meat, but not really, Argentinian meat is gonna be always better. This is good enough for Toronto standards.

I ate until I felt extremely full and then the dessert arrived. It was grilled pineapple and banana. I hated it because I can't eat pineapples and bananas when they're warm or cocked but my friend loved it.

The servers where ok. Not extremely friendly and not rude. Just ok. They where almost closing so maybe they were already tired.

I didn't see any dancers, shows or anything super fun. I guess I was too late. Next time I'll try to go earlier so maybe everybody is gonna be more alert and pay attention to customer service details.

The ambience is nice, not laud music and the appearance of the restaurant is very nice. It has 3 floors if I'm not missing one, and different areas for different occasions."}
{"text":"Great service beautiful restaurant and great variety of salad bar choices! 

There were tons of choices of meats all very tender and well marinated. One little complain is that often times the waiter comes by with the meats and not enough for everyone. They say they will come back with more but often do not. 

The whole dinner was very satisfying and great perk for all birthday diners because it's free when you show your id !"}
{"text":"I am not a meat person by any means, but I love coming here. I think it's because they serve a variety of things in small bites, it makes it all bearable. I love the chimichurri steak - it's seasoned so perfectly. And of course, THE PINEAPPLE! It's embarrassing how many times I ask for the pineapple to come around. It's a perfect palette cleanser before you try the next type of steak."}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant of all time. By far. Even vegetarians would love this place, great salad bar."}
{"text":"SUMMARY:
Food - 4 stars
Service - negative 4 stars

Management needs to review how to run a smooth operation, because this definitely is not.  

I have been here 3x now, 2x to regular Copa and once to the \"Copa by the Sea\" that is going on for December. Compared to the Eglinton location, this place is SLOW.  The food comes out at a medium slow pace. for the regular Copa, and practically a stand still for the Sea.  They said that there is a 2 hours seating limit but maybe if I got my food a little bit faster, I could be out of here in an hour or less and my food won't digest by the time the next food comes.  My 1st visit, I didn't even get full, but my 2nd visit was good, but still not as fast as @ Eglinton

Copa by the Sea had delicious food, but the management of the operation was a complete flop.

You are only allowed to order 3 items per pair at a time, and you are not allowed to order again until all orders are served & eaten. We didn't get our first order for almost an hour, and for our friends it took over an hour.  We were starving.  They are supposed to have food come by on skewers, they were very few and far between.  It was near the end of our meal that food started to come out a bit quicker, but there was still quite a delay.  We were there for 3 hours, and I think they let us stay past the \"2 hour seating limit\" because at the 1.5 hour mark we told the servers, \"we're starving, can we please get more orders?\" 

What I liked:
Sea Bass Ceviche - 5 stars - the flavours went together quite well, I liked the grapes, it was a nice touch
Shrimp Ceviche - 4 stars
Tuna Ceviche - 2 stars - flavours did not go well together, the nuts inside it was odd 
charcoal black cod - 5 stars - Excellent...if they have it in stock
lobster mac and cheese - 4 stars - very good, rich and flavourful
octopus - 2 stars - said pan seared but it was soggy
panko fried oyster - 3 stars - good, nothing special
cashew encrusted sea bass - 4 stars - but needed a little more salt
garlic shrimp - 4 stars - nice and garlicky 
coconut shrimp - 3.5 stars - ok, but i only go half a shrimp because they gave us one shrimp per pair, and they were small shrimp so I just had a little taste
shrimp tacos - 1 star - taco part was gross and inedible but inside was ok

the stuff on the skewers were mostly good but we only got one little piece and it didn't come out that often so I can't remember what we got.

When the food did come, most of it was quite good.  The information that my friends had gathered from chatting to the staff is that this \"Copa by the Sea\" was only on its third day.  Shi Bui was going to open up next door in around 6 months so the main chef left until the new opening.  The person that was cooking for \"Copa by the Sea\" was one of the chefs from Shi Bui, and I have to say that the seafood did taste delicious. One of the servers said that it takes around 20 minutes to charcoal BBQ the fish.  (Once again, this is second hand information so I'm not 100% sure if all of this is 100% accurate).  So when you look over at the chef, there is only one person BBQing, and if it takes 20 minutes to BBQ a fish, then why are you limiting the amount that can be ordered at a time?  They also ran out of black cod, and we heard that they only have 20 slices per night. How can you say all you can eat if you don't purchase enough to serve the patrons?  They need to put something on the menu, like they do in a lot of all you can eat sushi places, \"limit one per person\" so we know, and then to actually purchase enough black cod to last past 8pm. 

I really felt bad for the staff.  Most of them were quite nice but of course were stressed because food was not coming out, and we were all starving.  When the cheese bread came out at the salad station, everyone jumped on it.  One of my friends ate almost 2 loaves of it because he was so hungry.  In the end, it's really the management of the restaurant as opposed to the quality of the food, that's why I was so conflicted with how many stars to ultimately give.  If the food is excellent, and service may not be 100%, it doesn't bother me too much.  But in this case, the service was so horrible, I could not give a good rating.  I was going to give one star, but really, the food at Copa by the Sea was very good, and the regular Copa good.  Copa by the Sea was downstairs where Shi Bui used to be, and it was way too cramped, it took way too long to get our food, and it was way too loud.  The music was blaring so loud that we could barely talk  When we left, I thought that we can figure out what we are doing afterwards while we went outside, but then they had a speaker blaring out into the sidewalk.  It doesn't need to be deafening!! And they have scantily clad women dancing around in a cramped area where they might accidentally push you over.  On our way out we saw the dancers on the stairs away from the people eating, which was logistically much better.

They need new management.  I definitely will not return"}
{"text":"I'm huge on value, so having all you can eat food quality steak is truly heavenly.

I've definitely had better steaks at other restaurants, but never have I tried so many different variety of steaks. CopaCabana is my first Brazilian steakhouse experience and I've been here 4 times already. The quality is still relatively good, so trying at least 10 different cuts and marinations was extremely satisfying. I tend to start off at medium then I would change it up and get medium rare then rare itself.

3 times at the Adelaide location and 1 time at the Eglinton location. I like the Adelaide location much better , I had a fairly poor experience at the Eglinton location.

Also, if you're attending for a birthday, please beware of the service fee they add on. Last time I checked my bill and the service fee was a whopping 35 percent. I felt extorted, so for that reason I'll never visit the Eglinton location again."}
{"text":"Excellent! Amazing salad bar! Outstanding selection or meats! Delicious drinks! You cant go wrong here! Not one bad thing to say about the place. Excellent Rodizio!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience.  It was just on the pricey side, but a great experience nonetheless.  I would probably come here once a year.  The array and quality of meats were impeccable.  Mostly everything was juicy and fresh. The only exception was the salmon and chicken as they were on the dry side.  The food was high on the sodium side.  They should consider laying off the salt and perhaps just leaving salt on the table for people to add to it.  I also liked the salad bar that was included with the food, although I had to be careful not to overeat as there was so much selection with the main meal. They has an array of premade salad and also the option to make your own salad with different toppings.   The service was good.  After the first round, we found it was harder to wave someone down if you wanted seconds.  They were on the ball with continually changing plates and refilling water.  The Brazilian dancing was spectacular and definitely entertaining."}
{"text":"I grew up in northeast Brazil, and it's always a delight to find a Brazilian restaurant on my travels. Some have failed to live up to my \"native\" expectations, but not so with Copacabana.  These guys definitely got it right!

The service was attentive and personal. There is a nice variety of meats, and they were done to perfection. The picanha almost melted in my mouth - yummy! Guaran√° was available (a must have!) and the salad bar was well stocked. The fried bananas are superb, and you don't want to miss the grilled pineapple!  I loved the fact that farofa was available at the salad bar without having to ask for it. I didn't see any traditional p√£o de queijo, but the breads were fresh baked and delicious. I will definitely return when I next visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday party and I can tell you that this place uses a TON of Salt.  I get it... its All you can eat MEAT and Salt is required of course to season it but damn was everything Salty!  The selection of meats is just as described by other Yelpers on here...you have everything you can get on an Old Mcdonald farm that comes on your plate.  They do have a salad buffet where they serve....you guessed it...salad. Haha!  

Decor wise it is beautiful and the drinks are tasty and they have entertainment and all of the fancy stuff you would expect from an upscale Meat house.  Personally I would only come back here if I had too but if I was craving a juicy piece of meat I would go somewhere else.  The all you can eat meat is good if you want variety of meats though.  Pro Tip...the chicken is damn good but it will make you full FAST...so to portion that one out.."}
{"text":"\"all-you-can-eat\" and \"fillet-mignon\" in one sentence isn't something you hear often. Beef lover's paradise. Lots of variety of steak with a few varieties of chicken, shrimp and lamb. While we try to save our stomach for the steak the salad bar is just too irresistible. There's a great selection of breads, sides and salads."}
{"text":"Love going here for steak. My favourite is their house signature sirloin steak. Second favourite is Parmesan filet mignon. Also love their grilled pineapple - make sure you save room for that! 

I also find their salad and pasta bar to be really great so even if you're a vegetarian or not in the mood to eat so much red meat this place has enough variety to cater to all tastes. 

I was very pleased with their service. Waiters always ask if you've gotten everything you've wanted and if there's a particular meat you're waiting on or want and they'll bring it over to you. 

On weekends, belly dancers perform at 6:30pm and 8:30pm. 

Tip: if you want faster service, come early (eg 5pm) when it's less busy."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner this weekend and was not impressed. 

My buddy from Ottawa decided to do this for his birthday and after hearing many verbal positive reviews I didn't blink a eye! This review goes downhill from there..

After being seated we were told to go to the buffet to get some starters as we were waiting for the people to come around with the various meats. Most of the grilled items in the buffet were COLD, I didn't bother with it after my first plate. The meats were very rough and hard to chew didn't seem like very good quality. Fine its an all you can eat restaurant I get it, this isn;t Jacobs. But I've had better quality steak from AYCE Sushi restaurants. At the end of the dinner service we noticed servers going to other tables with meats we didn't get to partake on but by that time we were already too full to care. 

Other than that the service was decent, the manger even came by to check up on our table and tell us if we needed anything to ask. I wouldn't come here if I didn't need to and would suggest otherwise had someone wanted to plan an event here."}
{"text":"I've been to the Eglinton location and gave that 5 stars. I would rate this one slightly lower at 4.5 stars. Compared to the Eglinton location, it's more expensive here, but the d√©cor is nicer. Also, there is no live music, or at least not when I was there. I didn't see any space for live music on either floors. But food is great!

Like the other locations, there's a self serve section with salads, cold meats, sauces, and some bread. Soon after arrival, some guys will start to bring out meat on swords and ask if you want. They serve mostly beef cuts but also have some chicken, and brought us lamb. Near the end we even got salmon.

Just like the Eglinton location, food quality is excellent. Good meat does not need much seasoning. At Copa, it's just salt. They have one type of beef that's stuffed with cheese but otherwise everything is just good quality meat with salt. Self serve section is excellent. Their salads are really fresh and they managed to have all my favourite stuff there.

Service is excellent. This is one of those places that is almost \"overstaffed', unlike Asian places. Just when you walk in, you will see maybe 5 girls greeting you. You will never have problems flagging down a server."}
{"text":"I have been this location twice but host girls so rude and they don't give a any smile and nice service... I don't know why other location host girls so nice and friendly. I don't wanna go this location anymore."}
{"text":"Came here middle of the week. The servers where nice, but the place was running understaffed. Every 5 minutes a shaved piece of something would be available. It was my first time, according to my folks they have more options than regular steak and parmm steak and pineapple.

Take your hard earned money to a real steak house, eat with ease of mind, don't wave at servers every bite.

If not all of u want medium, like our situation you would have a hard time as well.

The quality of the food was good, the meat was delicious as well, the parm steak was delicious too."}
{"text":"All I can say is that I'm very disappointed. I had high hopes for this place but unfortunately it followed the fate of all other toronto restaurants. It started off strong, amazing service, delicious food.... now the food is sub par and the service is horrible. We are regular customers that come once a month and have celebrated numerous special occasions there... but I don't think that will be the case anymore. 

They are very good at updating their website on the  days when they have specialty pricing. We came on family day (feb 19) and prior to that booking I checked the website where it DID NOT say it was specialty pricing that day. I called ahead to confirm and they also told me it was NOT specialty pricing that day. But we were charged specialty pricing. I contacted the manager after and was given a spiel about how they need to compensate for wages going up and while it was not advertised as a specialty price day they had the right to raise the price if they wanted without customers knowing ahead of time. 

After that experience we gave the place another go. This time they tried to serve us \"Parmesan filet mignon\" as lower cuts of meet with Parmesan on top. It was disgusting and it was not Parmesan filet mignon like we've had a million times before. We politely asked the meat cutting guys and they kept bringing us non filet mignon with Parmesan, and our server twice to which we still did not get the correct meat. I finally asked her if they were just out of filet mignon, to which we replied \" no we definitely have it, let me get them to bring the right one out\".... it was the wrong meat again. I get if you are out of filet mignon but don't lie about it. 

I'm pretty fed up, and honestly this will mark the end to a good run at Copa cabana for us. I no longer rave to people about this place and I will no longer bring them business from hosting special occasions or bringing friends here to try the place."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been to a Brazilian steakhouse, over a decade if I had think about it.  Because of that this was going to be a whole new experience as far as my memory served.  My wife and I as well as our neighbors received gift cards for Copacabana back in December of '16 and only until now did we finally get to use them.  While there were several locations to visit such as the core, Yonge and Eg, we agreed to go to the one in Vaughan simply because the parking would be easier.

I had noticed weeks before that Saturdays on Open Table were blocked off from making reservations.  I had called the reservations number (toll free number for all the locations) and had inquired for an early table at 5pm on a Saturday on the Tuesday of that week and was able to get a table for 4 no problem.  They had called me back before noon on Saturday to confirm our reservation and arrival.

As for being in Vaughan this location is not near the Colossus on 7 or near the busy area of Vaughan Mills.  It's rather in a quieter part west of the 7/400 megacomplex in a stripmall on Marycroft east of Pine Valley.  Upon arriving there was plenty of parking mind you we were an early bunch arriving just before 5pm.  The interior has some pretty nice d√©cor and while they weren't set up for the outdoor seating yet the outdoor area is visible from the bar area near the main entrance and it looks like a really nice space.

The way this place works is that each person pays a flat rate of 50 dollars as it's all you can eat.  While there's a buffet for both cold and hot items, the meat is brought to your table by individuals who will shave it off spits and with your tongs (each person has a mini tong) you are to get the shavings and use your small side plate to collect it.  This concept has been around for a while.  There are a wide variety of almost all beef dishes (it is a steak place after all) whether cuts, how it's prepared or what it's placed with.  There are too many to mention.  In addition to the beef they also have lamb and for an extra special treat they have grilled pineapple as well this is so tasty.

It's very hard as a Yelper to take in the photos of this place.  It's a buffet for the cold and hot items as sides but I found myself preoccupied with obtaining meat instead of taking photos so the gist is many people will come to your table and continuously bring you meat and it's all very good.  If you are not partial to medium cooked they will do well done requests which may take a bit longer but they don't forget and seemingly are constantly bringing you more morsels to try in a nonstop meat fest.  

The cold buffet included a variety of salads, cold cuts such as salami and prosciutto, cheeses such as shaved Padano, blue and cheddar, a variety of breads, pastas and vegetables.  The hot buffet had several pasta dishes, potatoes, and other hot sides.  The meat here is obviously the main reason for coming however while the sides are just that, sides.  If you can eat a lot of meat and enjoy that sort of thing, this place would be worth it for you as an individual.  If you can't eat a lot and don't enjoy a wide variety of beef cuts and constant having to interact with servers then this place isn't for you.  If you have to think about it for those that really can't eat much 50 dollars for the all you can eat \"Rodizio\" is a lot if you can't make it worth your while.  Still, this place is also an experience and it's a nice treat and change from your everyday dining.

The service and hospitality here seemed better than just good and the servers aren't leaving you wondering when they'll be back again.  They are borderline incessant.  With drinks, tax and tip expect to pay about 75 dollars a person on average."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow!

I heard a ton of great things about Copacabana from my friends and co-workers, but my experience here definitely exceeded my expectations. 

The food, service and entertainment was extraordinary! The servers were super attentive and very accommodating. One in particular noticed I didn't eat any of the \"rarer\" meats so he made sure to bring me all the meats that were well done. So sweet! :)

Highly recommend the pineapple, fried banana and cheese balls - it was too good.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Having already been to the Eglinton location, I knew what to expect, but it's nice to have a location that is downtown. We came with the Mirvish Dinner package (ticket + dinner included for about an extra $20) which seemed like this had the best value. It was a Wednesday night, we came around 5:30. They didn't have my reservation that I made via email, however, there was enough space. It didn't start filling up until around 6:30. 

The all you can eat salad bar was really good. Although nothing unique, everything tasted really good. I got excited over a salad bar. I never get excited over salad. Choices included: coucous with peppers, quinoa salad, caesar salad, an excellent kale and pomegranate and blueberry salad, a sesame noodle salad. Also a freshly baked bread section, which had challah, multigrain and some really nice bread balls (crispy on the outside and soft in the inside) with fresh homemade garlic butter. 

As for side dishes was regular and sweet mashed potatoes, white and wild rice, and mac and cheese and lasgana (which wasn't very good but seemed like it was for the kids). 

As usual, the rodizios came around with all sorts of meat, my favourite being the filet mignon and the chimichurri beef. 

No need for dessert when you have bbq pineapple. 

Its usually $45 for the ayce buffet, and not sure if it's worth that much. Depends how much you can eat. That was the only disappointing thing was that I couldn't eat as much I wanted."}
{"text":"No complaints. Very nice staff. Amazing food. The side dishes were amazing. Overall I enjoyed it. Would go back but definitely pricey for a student as my boyfriend and I are. But it was nice to treat ourselves. I'm going to compare my expierence to Brazillian steak house. ( brasa ) and they had way more side dishes. But overall left without being able to move ...  so I think it was a good time. I would go back when we saved up bit more money. And also the atomosphere is very open which is nice  and there is an upstairs (5 steps ) which is nice aswell. Waitress and the cutter were both amazing. 

Thank you :)"}
{"text":"3 stars because the ambiance is really nice compared to their other location. Also, giving this place this rating because their salad/pasta bar is amazing! Loved the variety and the freshness in the add-ons. Onto the meat, for a steakhouse you would think that they are known for their steak but my favourite \"meat\" dish was their salmon. This was the only item that wasn't overly salty. All the meat dishes were good but wayyyy to salty. Another thing their \"call to meat service\" didn't work or they just bypassed our table intently each time when we marked that we still wanted meat to be served...we literally had to call the servers over to our table for more food...so minus one star either. Not worth the $60 price unless you like overly salty meat."}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday, and it was amazing!

The food is absolutely good, from the salads to the tender pieces of meat being offered at your table constantly. The servers are really kind and pretty generous with the amount of food they give you. They're open to requests when it comes to what kind of meat you would like to eat.

The place looks like a mix between a restaurant and a nightclub, it's nice, however, I reckon the cowhide on the walls doesn't look good and it's a bit disturbing. 

I didn't have the opportunity to see the dance show since I went there on a Sunday, which by the way is the cheapest day to go. I don't remember exactly but I payed about $37 (keep in min it's a all-you-can-eat), regularly they charge about $47 per person.

I would like to go back for the dance show and a pint"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a CopaCabana.  I have been to a Brazilian steakhouse before but not in Toronto.  This review is a bit late as we went back at the very end of May.
We were a group of 6...if you want reservations for a Saturday then book in advance or wait a while (I think we reserved about a month prior on OpenTable).  We showed up on time for our seating but still had to wait about 20-30 minutes passed.
Once we were seated...be ready for meat!  Vegetarians beware or just eat $45 worth of the grilled pineapple (which isn't a bad idea either).  The carvers would come in waves & never had an empty plate.  (Don't waste your time on too many of the sides but they were delicious too)  The carvers would also ask us what we preferred so our favs could keep coming.  We were there for about 2 hours & left with very full bellies.
The entertainment throughout was pretty cool as well.  They had the dancers & an aerial performer.  We sat upstairs so saw less of the action & was a bit darker once night came but overall a nice atmosphere.
I will be going back eventually, once I kick this case of the meat sweats."}
{"text":"Food is top quality. Everything was delectable. Service was great. Entertainment was also really great. Only downside, the music is unbearable. It's like eating at a night club. If you planned on having any conversation, this is not the place! It's such a shame because it's a great atmosphere and the food is so good."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!! The meats are out of this world. Service is very professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing. I brought my father here for his birthday and he couldn't stop raving for days. I'm not a fan of every type of meat but the top sirloin is my favourite and the grilled pineapple is a must!"}
{"text":"I very rarely give reviews online but I just had to share my experience. Immediately walking in we felt like we were at a club vs. a restaurant. The receptionist was very nice (due to the two starts) and she said our wait time would be 20min. We ended up waiting 40min and every time we asked \"how much longer?\" They would say \"5 more min\". We sat down and waited about 10min for a waitress to take our drink orders. When we realized no one was coming, we got up to get our food (this is a buffet). Soon after, our waitress arrived and being very polite she said \"I'm sorry I took so long, I wasn't informed I had a table waiting for me. I thought I was done\". **THE FOOD IS NOT TRADITIONAL BRASILIAN FOOD**( coming from a native brasilian ). They looked very understaffed. We barely got the \"rod√≠zio\" and even after we communicated with our waitress that we were barely getting served meat, nothing changed. Overall, not a great experience and I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Went there as a group to for Christmas dinner party (in January; you should try it then, much more relaxed). The first impression is great. From there it's a downhill. Food is as good as you can expect from an all you can eat. Attitude is 2 stars max! The whole music and dance thing lasts for 10-15 mins so don't expect much. AND we were asked to leave after 2 hours while we were only ordering drinks and chatting by then (we had half of our party arrive 30 mins late but it wouldn't matter. We STARTED half an hour late but it wouldn't matter). I would still be OK if not for the attitude! Half of the table (me included) were not offered salmon and shrimp again I'm a question mark for that too!"}
{"text":"As an update to the previous review, management apologized for the situation and offered us a complimentary meal as a compensation. We went again and this time the service was better, which made the overall experience more enjoyable. Food quality remained consistent."}
{"text":"yea in terms of rodizio, copa is prolly as good as it gets. I'll get around to trying Brasa in niagara falls sometime to see if it actually compares to copa but for now copa is the king of brazilian meat.

Well, for ppl who dnt know, concept is simple. Everyone in ur group gets a coaster with two sides (diff colors). Red means \"stop\" and the other color means \"more food\". The meat is brought around on mini swords by servers called gauchos. You pick up your tongs grab a slice of meat from the sword and the gaucho slices it off for u. They constantly bring out different meats with different spices on em. Pro tip: save room for the roasted pineapple. I can't get enough of that stuff. It's my partner's fave as well. And even when shes bloated she'll make room for pineapple. That's how good it is. There's a side bar with hot sides and cold sides. 

My first rodizio experience was at touro churrascaria uptown in richmond hill. While that place is bomb, I have to give the slight edge to copa because of the wider variety/selection of meats (several that I didn't see at touro). Service-wise, they are both on point.

Obviously, rodizio is expensive so expect to spend $$$. Backed up by great service, always, so no complaints on that front.

I've heard that you can catch a show from samba dancers on certain days which sounds pretty cool and entertaining!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The first time we went the service was bar-none fantastic, the second time was a little less great, but we managed. 
I was nervous beacuse I don't eat meat, but even only eating from the galleria (buffet)..and the grilled pineapple (of course, what do I look like a dummy??) always has me leaving full and satisfied. The food is really good and I would go back in an instant! 

Fridays and Saturdays they have entertainment, which is cool but can also be a little hindering if you are trying to go back to the buffet or get more meat while the dancers are doing their thing. 

Overall, I can't wait to come back, I'm still dreaming about their cheese buns and cornbread :)."}
{"text":"Hostesses are rude. Maybe brush up on some customer service, as that is their main job? A smile would go such a long way."}
{"text":"Firstly let me start by saying I love Copacabana. I have been a few times and the whole experience is amazing. However, not at this location! I have been at this location four times all together and each time is much worse than the last. The last time I was here for my husbands surprise birthday (with guests of 15+ people spending money) I was taken aside and pretty much scolded by the manager for two people (myself and birthday boy) for being 20 minutes late. But let's talk about my last and final visit to this location shall we?

Last night was my cousins 25th birthday. We came here to celebrate because we love the food regardless of bad experiences she wanted to try again. So try we shall! Well, my reservation started at 7:30 and we didn't get seated until 7:40ish. Even when our party was there on time. So let's hold that thought as I continue this review! The waitress was nice, she came more than anyone I've had before. So Kudos to her. However, it took forever to get the meat coming around to our table and when it did it was the two same things over and over again. We put requests in for the chicken parmesan and corn bread (both tasty) and we didn't see them until our last 20 minutes of dinner. It's a two hour time slot for pete sakes! 

What really made me see red was the end of our visit. We were \"supposed\" to be done at 9:30 according to their two hour limit, even though they seated us late. It was 9:31 as we put our jackets on and were gathering our things to get up and go, the waitress came over us to tell us we pretty much have to go. Like are you for real right now? You don't see the fact our jackets are on as an indication we are leaving? Not to mention, we lost 15 minutes of our \"time\" due to them and they are so quick to kick us out. What a way to make a customer feel unwelcome! What a crap experience!"}
{"text":"I've been to Copacabana's Adelaide location three times. Unfortunately, every time I've gone it's gotten worse. 

The first time I went was for my birthday (April 2017) with a party of five. My first time was fun because of Copacabana's concept of grabbing the meat from the skewer. I also really loved the variety of meat and the massive salad bar. 

The second time it was a Sunday evening (late 2017) and I felt like there was not a lot of meats rotating around and the waitresses were less attentive. However, the quality of the food was the same. 

The third time I went was for a birthday party (February 2018) for a party of 15 people. The person hosting the party had a reservation, but we waited 15min past our initial reservation time. Once again, the service was mediocre. 

My absolute favourites though from copcabana: grilled pineapple, and corn bread. 

I think this is a good restaurant to come try once and say you have experienced a Brazilian style steak house."}
{"text":"Ive been to Copacabana in Niagara falls as well as toronto, this location is in no way the best of the three locations but it it is till a great buffet as well as steakhouse. The flavours of all of food is mouth watering. Food such as Bacon wrapped fillet minion are and option as well as roasted pinapple with cinnamon and sugar. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great with classic Brazilian dancers. The food option is slightly different depending on what day of the week you attend the restaurant. Food such as shrimp and lamb chops are only available won the weekend yet thing like top sirloin and prime rib with cheese can be served any day of the week. The price of food is decent for a steakhouse. For everything that the restaurant offers its about 50$ on the weekend or 45$ on the weekday. 

The small buffet not including the meat is also a great choice but for the price its not worth it. Things like olives and pickles, cheese and stuff are an option."}
{"text":"We were a large group of about 20 people, and were sat at basically three different tables, not next to one another, so basically were unable to speak to others in the party, we could have basically gone to dinner in smaller groups, and not come to a birthday. This would have been understandable as this was a Saturday night in the city, and we were a large party which is hard to accommodate, however the person who booked this for her birthday did so about 1 month and a half in advance, and was not even told about being sat in different tables, across from each other, not remotely close to one another. Our service was good, especially since it was a busy night, our main waitress was great.

I'm very familiar with brazilian steakhouses, and have been to different places in the city, including Copacabana's other location at Eglinton.
Overall the atmosphere is very lounge like, loud with music, and fun, the entertainment is nice with all the dancers. The food also fantastic in terms of cuts, the bacon wrapped filet mignon, top sirloin, and parmesan chicken and steak, those are fantastic.

Service from the servers bringing the cuts was good, however I was surprised that there was a good 10-15 minutes between being served different types of cuts, which I don't blame the servers, who seemed unstaffed, but management who were not clearly organized with all tables getting equal service and distribution of the cuts. This was extremely surprising because every other brazillian steakhouse I've been to, including Copacabana's eglinton location, you basically never have a moment where your plate is empty, or you are left waiting for more cuts, but this was definitely not the case for this location."}
{"text":"The staff were great and so pleasant  The food was mouthwatering and still on my mind. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: This review is for my experience with a recent group booking.
 
I decided to have a joint birthday celebration (a friend + me) at copa cabana because I really enjoyed the food, it was a great concept for a large group (24 of us) and it didn't require a ridiculous minimum spend.
 
I usually enjoy the food and service at this location, but unfortunately I had a really bad experience for my birthday. There was a lack of communication from the venue, our seating limit was less than the indicated 2 hours, service was super slow (did not get to try everything), and the venue messed up my cake.
 
1. Lack of communication/acknowledgement by the venue
In order to secure a group booking, the restaurant required a $10/person deposit emailed/faxed to the venue within 24 hours of the initial booking. I completed my deposit within the 24hour time frame via email and requested that they confirm the receipt of my signed/contract & deposit. I sent several follow ups to management over the next few weeks and never received a response. I eventually called to make sure my reservation was in their system.
 
2. Seating limit was less than 2 hours
We felt rushed the entire time dining. The contract stated that the seating limit was 2 hours from the time of the reservation...which is very fair. My group arrived early and was seated shortly after 7:30 (time of the reservation). I expected that we would be served until 9:30pm. However, servers started cleaning our tables before 9pm. I would thought that the 2 hour seating limit really meant 2 hours for us to enjoy the food (similar to how they treat all other customers). The waitress approached us at 9:15 to let us know that the next reservation was here. Well that's great and all but I really don't care. I was told that we would be served for 2 hours from the time of my reservation therefore 7:30-9:30pm. This means I expect to be served until 9:30pm. Anyways, we only had a little more than an hour to enjoy our meal...we didn't even have a chance to try all the meat on the menu. Which brings bring me to my next point...
 
3. Food service was very slow
They split our group into 3 tables of 8. You would think the food servers would have treated this like 3 separate tables of 8...but nope. Servers would come around with food every 15 mins and serve a few of us then return the meat to the grill with promises to return. Sounds fair...except they never returned. As a result, I did not get a chance to try everything from the menu and neither did my guests. Service was also slow with a lot of down time in between each steak which is not typical of my past experiences (I would usually have a few pieces on my plate waiting to be consumed).
 
4. They messed up (lost?) my cake
My friends brought in 2 cakes to the venue since we were celebrating two birthdays...and they couldn't find one on them! When they started clearing the table (1h15mins into reservation time), they promptly brought out one cake. My boyfriend took our server aside and reminded her that there was a second cake. She came back to the table and announced to everyone that they have already given us our cake and proceeded to show the empty box to our table, ruining my surprise. Then my boyfriend had to describe the cake he brought in so they can search the fridge for it. They finally found it but what a disaster!!
 
 
I wanted to enjoy this experience, I really did. But hosting my birthday here was just a disappointment. We felt extremely rushed and not welcomed and to top it off they ruined my cake surprise. As ideal as the concept seems, I would strongly suggest to avoid hosting a large party here. Plus, judging from other people's reviews, it really seems like the venue does not appreciate group bookings anyways."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday so I didn't get the full experience of seeing the Brazilian dancers perform but the place does indeed have a sexy vibe to it. 

I thought the buffet selection was great. The salad bar in particular was amazing! I really had to resist not filling up on those and focus on the meat instead. As for the meat, it was delicious.  High quality stuff but VERY salty (perhaps to encourage you to buy drinks) which makes the salad bar really necessary. 

Memorable items: cornbread, parmesan chicken, parmesan filet mignon, top sirloin, bacon wrapped filet mignon, grilled pineapple and the salmon

One thing that really turned me off was service. As dinner went on, it progressively got slower and slower. The meat just took so long to come out and a lot of them were ones we didn't want anymore. The wait lets the fullness kick in or we just got too lazy to start eating again. Once you've tried everything and established your favourites, you will probably only want more of those...but it's not really up to you. They do take requests on what meat to bring out (and we made several) but only about half of them were fulfilled. Our main server was pretty inconsistent. She was more attentive near the end when it was less busy but was pretty much non-existent during the dinner (although we did have other servers check up on us).

Copacabana is great for a guys night out and birthdays (complimentary dinner for the individual - minimum table of 4). Overall, worth a try if you've never experienced this type of dining before."}
{"text":"For months and months I waited for this location to open.  I had never been to any of the Copa location and I chose my first experience to be the Woodbridge location.  Before you get the wrong idea I have been to Brazilian restaurants just not Copa.  Just recently I was finally able to get a reservation that worked for us.  I was so excited but.... I was disappointed.  Our reservation was on time our waitress was great but for the first almost half hour all we saw was one person come by to serve meat.  We were on the second level and could clearly see everyone walking around serving the first floor but they just seemed to forget about the second level.  I spoke to the manager and within minutes we had people serving our table.  The problem was when they did come they gave us one bite pieces of meat.  All the better meats we saw one time and they never came back out and had to ask form them to be brought out and even then some did not come.  We realized that at the portions that were being served it would take a while to get full and at $50 a person that's not acceptable.  All meats are cooked medium to medium rare so if you don't eat your meat that way I suggest you make other arrangements.  One person in our group liked their meat medium well so we asked for some meat cooked medium well.  They were willing to accommodate but it took quite a while.  Buffet options were also stingy compared to other Brazilian restaurants I've been to and what was put out seemed to be the end of the line.  Very little in the dishes.  

I am sure that there are still some hiccups because this location is still new so I am not willing to write off this place.  I will be back to give it another try.  Hopefully this review will change at that point.

The entertainment gets 5 stars"}
{"text":"We had reserved a table for 6 for my BIRTHDAY DINNER, we had double checked everything, over the phone we had gone over gluten free options, and so one... of course it was a very different story once we were there!!!!
Cheep buffet style food. Over crowded. Unpleasant staff. They rush you to hurry up as another reservations will soon be arriving... yet your waiting on you food....
Many times the guys ran off with the food not serving Everyone, vegetarians at the table were highly disappointed as we were promised options with shrimp and salmon!!! The guys with meat would just run by and attend more to the huge groups not the smaller groups and giving attitude, and limiting your portions!
even when we would call after them to come back- they would turn around- it's mostly steak- which is under cooked - badly- no seafood which was supposed to be gluten safe- it was not!!! (The reason I came here) 

The buffet of salads were gross! Soaked in vinegar, old and soggy! the hot table- nothin is gluten safe. The meat tasted bad- had this 'animal taste' low quality meat for sure. The seating is very open and loud and we hated the ambiance. The dancers were lousy and moody and shoved a few older ladies out of the way- which was very rude and jaw dropping!
All I liked here was the cheese roll I tried which was gluten free. And then I had to remind them it's my birthday and the experience was a negative one, at the end they brought me some kind of dessert which wasn't good either-  
Over all terrible experience Bo one enjoyed it! We could t wait to get the heck out of this sardine can!!!"}
{"text":"Copa was excellent. We loved all of the buffet items. Such a wide variety of salads and warm items. The meats were excellent. It was cooked to perfection. Great choices of meats and juicy and cooked well. We loved our experience. And birthday are for free (with ID). Will be back."}
{"text":"If you're familiar with Brazillian churascaria &  love them then this place is for you. If you're not then it's something you must try. This is a buffet place where servers come around & offer you an array of meats grilled on a large thick tower skewer which they slice right at your table. The little tongs are for you to grab your meat. Every meat I had was cooked perfect! I had Parmesan steak, bacon wrapped filet, skirt steak, chicken, salmon, lamb & some other beef with cheese cubed into it. Now before you  think I was a pig & ate individual steaks -hold up: 1)  I was a pig but that's because the meat is sliced small or little filets so you can trick your mind to eat plenty.  In between meat I had the grilled pineapple dusted in brown sugar.  They also offer traditional Portuguese /Brazilian food you help yourself to, like black beans, rice and many salads downstairs - but don't fill up on that. After all at $45 per person you better come to eat meat oh and I drank a few caipirinha's( Brazils drink of choice) I had a shanxi(not sure if I remember name exact) but this drink was also delish. Any drink made with a bright blue wins for me. I'm a sucker for tropical stuff since I'm from South America.  This was my first time at the adelaide/downtown location and was very pleased. I've been to the niagara location a few times in the past and had a great time then too.  The service was great/ we had a table of 8 people and the server kept coming to get our drink orders. Around 9pm they have samba dancers come around and shake their tail feathers. I loved it! I felt I was in Brazil. At the end of your meal they bring fried banana lightly coated in bread crumbs. 
I would definitely go back. Bring your appetite and don't worry about getting drunk off too many caipirinhas your belly will be coated with meat."}
{"text":"?????????????????????
????????????????????????
?????????????"}
{"text":"I went there two times. One for copacabana and another for copa by the sea which share the same restaurant. Overall the service is good, the meat was not as tasty as niagara copacabana. On the other hand, copa by sea doesn't have a good furnace system you need to eat with the jacket on and the food gets cold fast.Also, the taste of the food that I ate was plain. Advice, only niagara copacabana is good in service and food quality."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant Food was amazinggg
Meats selection was large, very tasty and hot off the grill.
will be returning for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the money just off the meat alone. They're salad bar is smaller than most for a Brazilian steakhouse which was the only disappointment, but the selection is still great and the bread is amazing. The meat is mouth watering and the sides they bring to the table keep you wanting more. The wait staff is very courteous and efficient. The icing on the cake was that the drinks and desserts are divine. A definite must to try in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went here a week and a half ago for the first time.  The downstairs of the venue is an all you can eat sushi place and the top two floors is for copa cabana.  They had a good lasagna and a salad bar, which is great because having pure meat would be way too heavy.

The wait staff were friendly, but the hostess had her head in the clouds?  She asked if it was our first time there, I said yes, and then she proceeded to walk away.  Ok sure, I get the gist of it, wait staff come around and give you small cuts of meat.  I would have preferred though that someone explained to me that I was supposed to use the tongs to hold the meat while it is being cut and then I was to transfer it to my plate.  The first meat came, I smiled and said, yes please, and then he started cutting, stopped, silence...... I looked at him, he looked at me, pause...... then, My companion told me to hold the meat with the tong. Ohhh.

Now, i finally got going and the rounds of meat came non stop, I had to decline a lot of meats cause the plate they provide is a small saucer plate and I can't eat so fast.  The food was great! My favourites were the hot chicken, it was succulent and tender and any filet cut of meat.  The prime rib with cheese was so flavourful and so was the house steak.  Within ten minutes I felt full, and was a bit disappointed actually, that my meal was lightning quick and I didn't even try a lot of meats that came around,  so, I ordered a drink, chilled for a bit, got my second wind, but by that time, there were no more servers.  I had to ask for a specific type of meat if I wanted to it.  So I guess, they have rounds, stop for thirty to 45 min, then start again?

Anyway, good place for hungry meat lovers."}
{"text":"It was just ok, went on a Thursday with five others, table was cramped and difficult to maneuver around.   Food was a little disappointing overall, the sides and salad options were surprisingly bad.  The meats were pretty good but compared to other Brazilian  steakhouses the variety was very limited.  We were there on a Thursday night and they closed most of the seating areas so they could cram everybody into one area, it was very loud and busy when it didn't need to be.  Standard tourist trap restaurant style in the theatre district, won't be in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"I always love copacabana but this one is definitley a step down from the Niagara and Yonge locations

Service is as bad as the jam packed Niagara location on a weekend when your stuck on the patio. 

We did have one meat guy who was attentive but the rest including our waitress were horrible, they are lucky I was not paying as I would have gave the meat guy cash in hand and left zero tip for anyone else

All in all though it is still copacabana in a much more friendly location so I am sure I will still end up here a couple times a year.

Pondered a 2.5 review because I definitely have experienced better but it was not bad enough that I will never go back so I will leave it a 3/5."}
{"text":"It's all you can eat steak. And it taste great.. 

Cons: Gets busy. and when it is busy.. service can sometimes be non existent.
Sometimes you don't get as much selection as normal. sometimes they don't stop by your table with grilled pineapple when you should.

What else is there to say. Its all you can eat steak... and it taste great..."}
{"text":"Came here around 9pm on Saturday and I was very impressed! The buffet is huge, there are so many options to choose from (veggies, pasta, beans, fruits, potatoes, bread... and so much more).

There will be waiters coming around sharing different types of meats. My favourite was the bacon wrapped filet mignon and garlic seasoned steak (I forgot which cut). So worth the money!

Overall my experience was amazing! I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Summary: high quality meat in an upscale place for a big price. Worth it.

Top Must-Get: prime rib/lamb chops
Top Regret: spicy chicken

I came here with a friend who made reservations for us on a Sunday evening at 730 pm. We got here at 725, and we're seated just after 740 pm. It's a classy looking place with a great vibe.

As the waitress explained, we would start by taking our plate to the salad bar, and they had a number of options including mashed potatoes, mashed SWEET potatoes, bread, pasta, rice, and your traditional salads too.

Upon our return to the table, we could flip over the coasters to the blue side to indicate the servers walking around with giant cuts of meat could offer to us (we could flip the coaster to the red side to pause... in practice, I think most servers just offer anyway though since the coasters sometimes get buried beneath plates).

When the staff come, you use a mini tong to HOLD but NOT yank the meat. They slice it off with a knife as you hold it in place, and VOILA, glorious, delicious meat on your plate.

Okay, not every cut of meat was delicious, but quite honestly, most were at least GOOD, a couple were meh, and a couple were sweat drop-inducingly brilliant.

The chicken? Dry.
The sausage? Under-flavoured.
The salmon? Apparently dry AND under-flavoured*

*The salmon was one of the only seafood dishes. The downstairs sister restaurant focuses on seafood exclusively but is separate from this one.

But the lamb chops... Good gracious, I think eating two or three runs of THAT made it worthwhile, and then...

The prime rib was INSANELY flavourful and so amazingly tender.

My friend usually doesn't like cinnamon but got addicted to their famous grilled pineapple which is seasoned with cinnamon - but quite honestly, I thought it was too sweet.

The meat keeps on coming, and with just two people at our table, it was quick and efficient, although I can see where bigger parties of 8+ would be a lot slower (they have to slice each piece of meat off for each person on the spot).

In general, service was excellent and we developed rapport with a couple of them.

I think you can stay up to two hours, but we were ready to go well before that (and again, being at a table of two nearest the kitchen DEFINITELY helped).

Bill came to over $50 each.

I'LL BE BACK."}
{"text":"My family had Christmas dinner at the Copacabana downtown. There were 8 of us - 7 adults and a 6 year old child. Our experience took a downturn as soon as we stepped into the restaurant and met the hostess whose grumpiness cast a dark shadow on what was to come.

Our table was near the bar on the second level. We started at the buffet down the slippery stairs on the main level. The cramped setup of all you can eat salads, deli meats, breads and sides made it difficult for patrons to navigate the path of food. The items were plentiful but run of the mill and typical of an all-you-can-eat salad bar. Nothing was reflective of anything Brazilian.

The grilled meats that were brought to, and carved table-side were disappointingly inconsistent. Some items were good, but others were bland and unremarkable. There was no where near the 18 types of grilled meats that are mentioned on their website. I counted 9 items, one of which was grilled pineapple.

What WAS out of the ordinary was the condescension of the wait staff - one in particular who castigated our dinner companion for tugging on his serving of sirloin with his ice cube tongs. He emphasized that as a result, the entire spit would have to be discarded. Perhaps diners require a more thorough education before being served. This interaction coloured the rest of the evening as our table lived in fear of handling the various meats improperly rather than enjoying its pleasures.

The frequency in which the different meats were offered to our table was very frustrating. We watched as other diners received a parade of servers, while we had to cajole a sympathetic waitress to order some shrimp for our table. 

All of our issues were magnified by the substantial price point of the dinner.

We were all excited about dining at the Copacabana and we anticipated an authentic Brazilian food experience with welcoming hospitality, especially in light of the fact that it was Christmas dinner. We were left very disappointed and unfortunately, we will not return."}
{"text":"We were given 2 hours from our reservation time to eat which was sufficient. We ordered drinks. Alcoholic beverages came quickly. Iced tea took about 25 minutes to come and it was watered down. Too much ice or sat somewhere too long. We ordered 3 pitchers of sangria at $40 a pitcher. The server took 1 of the pitchers away when there was still a little bit left in it. In the last half hour of our time, it felt like they were rushing us out. But it was after 9pm on a Sunday night and no one was waiting for a table. 15 people in our party so we paid a big bill and you just feel like you're being rushed. On the upside, there was one  meat server that was attentive with what meat we were still waiting for and accomodated the well done request of a couple of our friends."}
{"text":"Been to the vaughan location which was great so decided to give the downtown location a try and I was not happy. Reservations were at 10 didn't get seated until quater  to 11. We also had to put a $10 deposit per person to secure od reservations, what  is purpose of that if we are being seated an hr after our reservations. I even asked when I called to make the reservation that we will be seated at the time of reservation their answer was yes of course .  Everytime we asked the hostess her answer was \"we are cleaning the table another 5 minutes\". ..10 minutes passed we asked her again and her answer would be\" I can't really give a time\".  Finally we get seated. Our waitress MARIA was HORRIBLE.  She was rude anytime we asked for something she eithered ignored or answered back in rude unprofessional way. Now for the food. The meats were tough.  We didn't get all the different types of meats except for the parmeasn sirloin and garlic sirloin , we didn't get any of the seafood, the pineapple and fried banana were hard to get. Our table kept getting by passed.  Over all bad experince would not recommend this location.   Not a happy customer."}
{"text":"Loud. Loud. Loud. 
Not the place to go if you want to be able to carry a conversation. All the meats are GENEROUSLY seasoned, to the point where its annoying. Your money is best spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place.  I attended a birthday dinner a few weeks ago, not knowing what the restaurant was all about.  The service was great, the food was mind-blowingly delicious, and we had lots of fun.  I will definitely be returning and raving to all of my friends about this place."}
{"text":"Top Service , very proffesional and fast. 

The food was amazing, everything is fresh and hot. The salad bar has alot of variety and the bread is baked fresh."}
{"text":"We went to Copacabana to celebrate a family member's birthday. We had visited other locations of this restaurant over the years so we knew what to expect. The Vaughan location is modern and spacious. It was surprisingly busy (and loud) for a Sunday evening. The salad bar had quite a few choices but we were careful not to fill up so as to save room for the main event. We especially loved the parmesan crusted sirloin and bacon-wrapped filet. Unfortunately, because they are so busy, you don't always get the full rotation of their selection. On this particular night, there was a lot of steak and very little salmon and no chicken. Given the steep price, one might argue that you're better off with steak to get the best value for your money, but as they say, variety is the spice of life. ;) The grilled pineapple is always good, the perfect finish (no need for dessert), but they do need to grill it just a little bit longer and come through at least twice and give everyone a good serving. It would be great if they could expand the grilled fruit to include some other choices for a change. Service is great, the servers are always obliging and happy to accommodate when we had special or repeat requests. I would go again but usually limit it to once per year on account of the cost."}
{"text":"I have been to 3 Brazilian steakhouses before (Houston, TX, Vancouver, BC and an NCL cruise ship), and this one rates near the best. Service is fast, the skewered meat keeps coming. Sirloin, bacon wrapped filet mignon, Parmesan encrusted filet, lamb, chicken.... all were perfectly done, everything tastes amazing. Dinner was $55, which includes all you can eat of he meats, and a huge selection of sides including grilled veggies, rice, fresh breads. potatoes, soup, salads, etc. This is a very nice place, many people were dressed up for an evening out. I wore a collared shirt and jeans and felt comfortable, however would probably have fit in a bit more in dress pants. Live entertainment was excellent as well, 'samba' dancers once an hour or so. All in all I'd go here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I've got mixed feelings about this place. 

First off, the good: 
1) the quality of the food is top notch! If you are a carnivore, you like fresh grilled meats, while looking at hot Brazilian/Spanish waiters, it's a fabulous place. The food is awesome, everything's so juicy, freshly sliced off the massive skewers, different marinated flavors, all yummy in my tummy. Favs: house steak, cheezy steak, cajun rub rib eye(i think?), and grill pineapples are absolutely to die for. Salad bar is good to have but pretty much useless - I had a bunch of pickles to cut the grease. Still appreciate that it's there. 
2) The service is also fabulous, you can request whatever you want more of - they are usually really fast and attentive. 
3) Nicely decorated restaurant. dim light, really great seating, kind of romantic - a bit cold with the crazy a/c but hey it's a small thing. 

Well if the good is good, the service is good, and the atmosphere is awesome, what can you possibly ask for?

Ok here come the not-so-good: I feel force-fed. If their goal was for high turnover then they definitely easily achieved that. Instead of a nice enjoyable dinner, i feel force-fed by the lovely waiters and waitresses and not a slow dinning experience. I could just eat slower, but it's a bit difficult when all the nice meats come up so fast every couple of minutes, pile up on my plate, and getting cold (please turn down the a/c!). The meats come up so fast it's impossible to figure out which was what on my plate in the pile. 

What can they do to make it better? Maybe have two-three grilled skewers make rounds and give it like 10-15 min break for the diners before any other meats are brought up. I think that would allow the diners to enjoy the food rather than getting piled up plates. I guess I could have turned my sign from \"sim\" to \" nao\"....  

Help me slow it down copacabana - for $55 dollars a person, I'd like to sit here for two hours and enjoy it if that's ok? Also, please turn down the a/c a bit."}
{"text":"I dare to call this experience 'holy war'; the servers bringing the steaks look like angels descended from the sky, even after the tag was placed to Nao. Server was super friendly and detailed even during the Friday dinner rush. I just wish there was better way to appreciate for their hard work and smile!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I believe I have mentioned this before in other reviews but I personally really don't enjoy buffets. My humble opinion is that you end up eating too much to get \"you money's worth\" and don't really enjoy anything in particular. 

Why did I come to visit, you ask? We ended up here for my (soon to be) brother in law's birthday celebration as he is a huge fan of CopaCabana.

I am so glad I booked a reservation in advance as it was super busy when we arrived. So busy in fact, our table wasn't ready yet. We ended up ordering a couple of drinks at the bar while we waited to be seated.

Even though I don't really eat meat anymore, I did opt for the \"full\" buffet as they were offering salmon on skewers. The buffet was plentiful and offered many tasty options. Don't make the rookie mistake of filling up on their yummy breads and salads before you get your fill of meats. The salmon took a white to come around but was really tasty when it finally did land on our table.

Overall, our table enjoyed the meal and we did for sure leave super stuffed. We did have to request certain meats for the table a couple of times. Side note, if you visit on your actual birthday (they will ask for ID), your meal is free!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday a couple months ago. I absolutely loved it! The restaurant itself is spacious and well designed. Super cute for IG photos!

But the food? Oh my gosh I can't forget it. Definitely one of the best places to try all types of meat. The house special was okay but the chimmichurri was amazing. Cooked to perfection. Remember to get the grilled pineapple and cornbread. Can't wait to try niagara and downtown :)"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that this place is expensive...but with good reason. If you spend the entire night eating the prime rib cheese steak, it is worth it. It's the best prime rib I've had in my life. MY LIFE
The sides are mediocre, although the buffet table LOOKS great. *they are trying to deceive you into eating other things than the grilled meats* The point is to not be carried away by the sides and if you want to make your money's worth...focus on the grilled meats.
Side note: fried cinnamon banana and pineapple is delicious
Side, side note: they bring out cute truffle like desserts in a martini cup with a birthday candle if you let them know it's your birthday!"}
{"text":"(08/07/2014)
Price: $37.50... For those not able to find it anywhere online!
** Definitely worth the slightly further walk down the main strip if anything for the cheaper price compared to Braza (~$42.50).

This was our second time having Brazilian food in this and it was even better than the first!  The meats were very tender and flavorful, however, the chicken tended to be too salty for my taste.  The array of sides were delicious and healthy.  The pineapple - unique and a must have!

*Service: 4.5 / 5 - Our waitress was very attentive!  I would have given a 5 except that they were very busy so the meat carvers didn't get around to everyone evenly.

*Ambiance: 5 / 5 - Great musician that night; reminded me of John Mayer!"}
{"text":"Eat meat till you drop! this all you can eat Brazilian steakhouse is a state of the art steakhouse with good quality beef/chicken and is guaranteed to satisfy. We loved the location, service, atmosphere and of course quality of steak. TWO THUMBS UP"}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's birthday dinner. Salad bar was great. DANCERS are amazing and entertaining. The Garlic steak was really good. Service was not that great. We were seated in the corner and our party was 15 guests. Servers kept forgetting to serve us on our side of the table. We had to requested certain meats due to food allergy and was forgotten severals of time. Price was a bit pricey for such mediocre service. - would not come back to this location again! Do not recommend for larger parties of 5"}
{"text":"Been there few times. Not much to say but excellent, excellent and excellent. Very happy to spend money there and have no problem to pay 18% gratuity for a group of 6. All they want is to feed you, make you happy and make you come back again. Love it."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The service was amazing and the food is delicious.  I'm pregnant and I asked 1 waitress what meats were well done and she said all red meats are medium rare. I made a sad face and told her okay, I'll stick to the other stuff because I'm pregnant.  She told me just to ask them to make some well done and I told her it was okay, not to worry.  So she went and had them make a few meats for me well done even though I told her it was okay. I was actually surprised because most people don't tend to go out of their way. I didn't expect that. I stuffed my face and arteries lol. My 3 year old ate sooo much and loved the meats. The show with the girls dacing samba was also really nice.  Overall I really liked this place and place. I loved the ambiance too! Thank you for the black beans and yucca/cassava!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, waiters and hostesses were very nice but service was slow and messy. Food isn't worth the price. Dancers were great but we were seated at a corner table--facing the wall. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Really great steaks, one of my favourite restaurants in the city. 

However it's really hard to get them to constantly bring you steak near the end of your time allotted, or have your favourites keep coming despite them repeatedly asking."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time recently. Was very pleasantly surprised. Steak is decent and if I could I would make sweet love to the grilled pineapple."}
{"text":"Did you know if you have a group of 4 or more and it's your birthday you eat here for free?

That's amazing.

So we found this out as we took one of ours out for a birthday here and even if we paid full price it would have been worth it, this place is great! 

A really different kind of dining experience but we found it to be really fun, tasty and satisfying.

The variety and quality of meat is fantastic and while I wasn't a fan of every single one (rib eye filled with cheese? no thanks), I cannot wait to go back and take other people who i know would love this place.

Protip: don't hit the salad bar right away. Get a few rounds of meat into you first and then take a break from the rich meats to go get a salad or something to cleanse the palette, so you can get back to the meat'ing!"}
{"text":"On the whole I like Copacabana a lot, but this location has actually run out of items fairly early in the evening. This is something I've never experienced at any other Brazilian BBQ anywhere I've tried it throughout North America. To me that speaks of a management problem that needs to be tended to. I would still come to Copacabana as it's my preferred local Brazilian place, but they should be held to account and deliver a premium meal including everything it should given the premium price."}
{"text":"I went here for my 40th birthday and after reading some of the reviews regarding service I was a little worried. With that being said, the food and service was great. Yes, you just have to be patient at times because there are lots of people but when the servers arrived they would constantly ask you if there is anything you would like to return to your table quicker. Very attentive and always ask if you're having a good time. The pieces they cut are usually small but you can always ask for more if you want - just be polite.

The meat was a little salty at times but also very tender. The bacon wrapped filet mignon and garlic beef were personal favourites as was the roasted pineapple.

The \"salad/sides\" bar was also great. It's hard not to fill up on breads, salads, cold cuts and black bean and pork stew (I believe it was called Feijoada). Delicious. They even had mac and cheese and other heated sides which were great.

Getting a reservation is key especially when you have a large group... if not prepare for a long wait or don't even bother. Because of the popularity of the place you'll need to use a credit card for the reservation and will charge you if you or any of your guest are a no show - changes/cancellation to the reservation is possible within 48hrs.

The entertainment was a great bonus. Brazilian dancers and aerial silk acts were fun to watch. The dancers would roam through the seating areas so everyone had a chance and pleasure to watch them. They performed every hour or so (I can't quite remember).

The only thing disappointing was that the roasted leg of lamb only came out after we finished dinner. We saw if on the website but guessed that it just wasn't available or would have asked about it. A list of meats being served for the evening would have been nice. Also the music at times was a but loud so we needed to shout at each other. You can't have everything ;)

We'd probably go back but only for special occasions unless you have the money and appetite to spend ;)

PS.Try the cheese puffs. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to the Copacabana in Vaughan during the week and then to the downtown location on the weekend on my wife's insistence. Since I've been to 'Brasa' in Niagara Falls, I had experienced a much better version of the Rodizio so my expectations were set a lot higher. First the Vaughan location, the selection of meats was somewhat limited on a weeknight. Many of the items they served were lukewarm and lacked the flavor the same items at Brasa had. The staff was very nice and attentive, they came over frequently to ensure that we had everything we needed but the food itself was lacking.

At the downtown location (Adelaide), the place was huge and spread out over 3 floors. That may be the reason that we sat around waiting for over 5 minutes for each different item to come around...and it was cold/lukewarm over 70% of the time. It only started to improve in terms of temp once the crowd thinned and there were fewer. My tip to anyone considering going despite my lackluster review, sitting on the main floor as close to the walking aisles as possible otherwise you'll be watching as the servers walk half way towards the end of the room and then either run out of the food or just head off into a different direction. We were lucky that my wife found a sympathetic server that noticed us being ignored and went out of his way to bring us all the items one by one in quick succession. The food was just ok....none of the items was particularly great...or even comparable to Brasa...sorry to keep promoting them but I guess you have to compare to be fair. If you really want the proper experience...I recommend you go there"}
{"text":"Finally tried the Downtown Toronto Location 
Of Copacabana ....and truly had a great time ! 
Food was amazing , service is prompt and friendly .
I tried a red sangria and it was so good I ended up having 3 of them !! I shoulda just got a pitcher ! 
Suggestion is to make a reservation as it does get busy , even on a Sunday evening ! 
Salad bar is amazing aswell ! 
Dress well and bring your friends or date to be entertained and have a rest meal !"}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant for Father's Day and what a disappointment. Our waitress was horrible barely came to check on us and when she did could barely hear her cause the music was so loud. I felt like I was 19 at a downtown Toronto club. When we asked our waitress for special orders she never communicated it to the kitchen.  The guys walking around with the meat would ask if we wanted anything special and when we asked, it would take forever to get it. We asked for the roasted pineapple and it never came until the guy remembered at the last minute and we were paying the bill to leave. Also I placed my plate to the side of the table so it could be taken away and one of the meat serving guys came up and pushed it almost right back at me into my lap. When he did this the plate pushed my dirty knife and fork onto my lap staining my clothes. I was not impressed and he didn't even apologize. We noticed other tables were getting served different desserts and we had to flag a girl down with fried bananas just to get some! When paying the bill I believe it was the manager that came with the machine and man it wouldn't hurt to crack a smile, the guy looked miserable and barely said two words to us and my mother in law was being nice and said everything was great but we really wanted to tell him the truth. Furthermore, the food was ok but not worth $50 a person. I know this place is new and hopefully there is room for improvement but all I can say is NEVER AGAIN for us, I can't bring myself to give them anymore money than I already have!"}
{"text":"Pros
Great atmosphere 
The waiters who served the meat were super helpful and friendly. 
The food was amazing. 
The roasted pineapple, cornbread and deep fried bananas were perfect
The ribeye and hanger steaks were my fave. 


Cons 
Waiter didn't get us side plates in the beginning had to get them from the buffet table no big deal she just forgot 
I like my wine chilled but the wine was room temperature as it's supposed to be 
Not really any cons just personal pet peeves of mine 

Recommendations 
If you don't love meat do not step a foot into this place!
I would recommend getting some wine as it does taste amazing with the steaks and some salad to balance out all the meat 
I would also recommend sticking to the steaks as the chicken and sausages aren't that good 
You can also request certain types of meat that you like which is great
And come hungry !!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for our 2 year anniversary dinner. Food was fantastic, service was great as well. We both had a lot of fun! The dancers were entertaining as well. For the next couple of days we kept reminiscing on how great our dinner was here! Wish they had these in Michigan!"}
{"text":"Checked out the downtown location.  I have to say, i was quite blown away.
The Eglington location has a nice \"back home\" feel and very comfortable.
This location was very chic, I felt like I was teleported to Manhattan.
The service was very friendly, very quick and attentative.
If you have never tried a Brazilian Steak House, basically the staff come to your table and slice off a piece of meat from a large skewar of meat and place it on your dish.... The staff came around quick and very often. I hardly had a chance to go for seconds at the salad bar... but when visiting a Brazilian Steak House, who wants salad?? :)
The quality of the meat was good, I especially loved their bacon wrapped filet mignon and the cheese prime steak (i think it's called)... and a few others that i can't recall the name of... 
Dress sharply... this place is quite trendy and i felt awkward in my comfortable sneakers (i was caught in the rain and my dress shoes were soaked)... If you're cost conscious, go between Sunday and Thursday... price goes up Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"This was an excellent evening. The wait staff took care of us very well, remembering my mother wanted meat well done. They brought us more stuff that we asked for. Our waitress (Stacy) read my mind when I was thinking I wanted more water. And Carlos REALLY took care of making sure my mother enjoyed the evening.

The hosts / hostesses honored our request to be seated inside and my mother had the most perfect seat in the house to do what she likes to do and see everything including the enjoyable dancing."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, great service and the meats are good too, for some reason I find that the eglinton location brings the meat to the guests sooner than Adelaide, I've had almost cold meat served to me at Adelaide on two occasions, otherwise everything else was great!"}
{"text":"I went to copa by the sea for a second time. The menu has changed drastically and the price has gone up. I was expecting all of this but unfortunately it was not as good as it was before. 

The menu has a lot of sushi (which I did not order much if, if I wanted suchi I would go to a Japanese place) and a lot less ceviche, which was the most disappointing thing of all. The first time coming here I ate more ceviche then anything else. 

Otherwise the drinks were good and the garlic shrimp was great. We also had beef ribs which tasted amazing!  

If they bring back more ceviche this would easily get 5 stars"}
{"text":"Copacabana is one of our favourite places to eat. There is a buffet of Salads, Sides, Cold cuts and Bread. After that, there will be people running food to your table and cut meat table side. However, the service is becoming more disappointing. There are no hosts that answer phones and it is really infuriating because if we change our plans or want to put in special requests, the waitress is always MIA and last but not least. I found a dark brown long hair in my salad. It is the same colour as the girl's hair on the salad bar. The waitress apologized but the Manager did not come to apologize nor did he take anything off our bill. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Came here once with my boyfriend and I was pleasantly surprised by the meat. It's definitely high quality meat and quite delicious but intend a bit salty. I'm giving this place a 2/5 as I was a bit insulted by some of the servers here - they seemed to have a bit of a conceited tone. Being my first time here I was confused when the server came with the prime rib steak and simply stood by our table. After a few awkward seconds (but what felt like an eternity) he rudely rolled his eyes and nodded towards my knife and fork. Ummm you couldn't have explained that to me?! Maybe I'm a bit high maintenance when it comes to service but when I'm spending over $50 for dinner, I expect not only high quality food but also high quality service. Our lady server was very friendly though and she was very accommodating. 

Another reason I'm not a huge fan of this place is because the music is SO loud. Maybe we were placed in a poor spot but wow we were yelling to hear to each other and I ended up getting a headache at the end of the night (loud music + salty music + screaming = not a good mix). And finally, I hated the feeling I got at the end of the night. I didn't eat much at all (probably tried 5 small pieces of the meats) but I felt MAJOR itis at the end of the night."}
{"text":"This place is loud. You cannot hear yourself think. But its really cool. All you can eat meat is amazing. Sangria was not bad. The unlimited sides are pretty good too, there's guac, bread, cheese, etc. Dancers were amazing but they should dance more!

Here is the meat we tasted:
Lamb
Pineapple
Spicy moroccan chicken
Prime rib cheddar
Sirloin steak
Plank steak
Chicken parmesan
Brazilian caneyo (spelling?)
Chicken drumstick
Spicy chicken
Garlic sirloin
Fried banana
Top sirloin
Bacon filet mignon
Buttermilk ribeye
Parmesan filet mignon
Salmon teriyaki
Chimichurri"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.    Good food.   Everything went great. Very helpful ppl nice and friendly.    Price was ok  for the service you got was more than ok."}
{"text":"Great location for food, but last time was disappointing. When we came before (few months ago), we asked if some of us could just take the meat and not the full buffet, and the staff said no, in order to avoid people cheating (which make sense). Thus, the price was cheaper for only the meat than the full experience.
Yesterday, we came in, asked for the meat only, the waitress said ok, gave us plates, and we enjoyed some fine meat and service. However, at the time we wanted to pay, we realized that they charged us the full buffet/meat. We asked, and they told us that we couldn't pick only the meat. Weird as we asked the waitress at the beginning, and she didn't mention anything about it. 
Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"So to start this review off I will say that the food here was amazing, by far one of the best restaurants I have been to. That being said the reason I gave this place 3 stars out of 5 is because of their managements organization. I was here for a birthday party and we had made reservations 2 weeks well in advance and even confirmed our reservation the same day. After checking in with the receptionist it took them 50 minutes to seat us after having to consistently remind them that we were still waiting. So moral of this is that don't make plans after going here and expect to be their on time."}
{"text":"The buffet was so amazing with lots of options. My favorite is probably the filet mignon and pretty much all of the steaks were good except for bbq chicken (So dry) and shrimp (way overcooked). There's also live dancers/performances during the night which makes the dining experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. 

Servers were very attentive, came by with water/plates and many other things every 5/10 minutes. 

Meat came around the tables in waves! I had never been so I was not expecting to be bombarded by so many different types of meat, but it was an awesome experience.

Drinks were great, ordered the house specialty (forget the name but it's a famous Brazilian cocktail), sangria that my girlfriend ordered was also delicious. 

The only complaint is the cost, but when you're getting a bunch of great fresh meat you can't complain too much because you should be well aware of what you're getting yourself into at a Brazilian Steakhouse. 

10/10 will return again some day."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat but not totally authentic. 

The churrascaria follows the rodizio method which is basically \"all you can eat\" and they will bring several different types of meat to your table. The restaurant also has a cold and hot buffet which you can go as you please.

Unlike a traditional Brazilian Churrascaria, this place has a lot of meats that are seasoned, or should I say, destroyed, with garlic. They also lack several types of meats you would find in a traditional churrascaria.

The \"dessert\" is fried banana. Served somehow in a \"gourmet\" style. It shouldn't be this way at all.

We ordered wine and none of our 3 choices were available. The only available was a much more expensive bottle which we ended up getting but obviously no discount was given. The wine only arrived 1/2 way thru the meal, which made the experience even worse."}
{"text":"This location was really busy on a Saturday night, but my boyfriend and I were able to get a table for two in less than 10 minutes. They had a great selection of side dishes to choose from at the buffet, with my personal favourite being the grilled veggies. We were able to try almost all the meats that came out, but my only complaint would be the long wait time because the servers would hardly come over to our table. Other than that, the food was great and the Samba dancers were very entertaining. Next time we will probably go to the Eglinton location because we experienced better service there."}
{"text":"If it's all you can eat meat you're after, then look no further. Tasty cuts of meat served to your hearts content. Filet mignon, top sirloin, flank, prime rib, you name it, they got it. Went on a week night and it was good value. Salad bar was sub par in my opinion but that was not the reason I went. All around good value if it's a protein only kind of night."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to have my company paid for my dinner here. Let's just say after the dinner, my team and I all had a little bit of difficulty to walk :)

The ambiance of the restaurant was fantastic! Dimmed light and decor were very classy, perfect for any occasion. The service was great - we never had any problem of food shortage. 

Next, the food. As a rookie for Copacabana, I may have stuffed myself a bit too much with the food at the salad bar. The selection was great - they have everything from many different kind of bread and dips, pasta, and salad. Now let's talk about the real deal - the meat. Everything that came to our table were just slices of heavenly meat. The New York prime rib and the Parmesan steak were probably my faves. In between the meat, they'll bring you delicious carbs 
in the form if cornbread and cheese balls. They're a trap because those fills you up much faster, if there's one thing I've learned. 

Will definitely be coming back, although this time I'd definitely make sure I fast the day before!"}
{"text":"This location shares their front door with Shibui. As you walk into the reception area, you have a choice to head downstairs into Shibui or upstairs to be seated in Copacabana. On the third floor, there seems to be a lounge and bar sort of deal going on. The sign outside is kind of understated so you gotta pay attention or you might miss it when you're walking by.

The service was reasonably quick on a Wednesday night at around 7. Most of the tables were filled and you could smell the delicious meats as the servers passes your table. Earlier in the night, servers also walked by with corn bread and cheese balls (should really try the corn bread!) Once you grab a plate and fill it with your selection from the salad bar, servers will know to come by with various selections of meat.

I thought the pasta/salad bar was pretty average. The cheese and prosciutto selection they had also wasn't that impressive either. However, some dishes to try on your visit: their cole slaw, mussels, and sweet potato mash. These were the only ones that really jumped out at me. 

Onto the meats: we didn't see any filet mignon, pork ribs, or turkey breast last night, and pork sausage was by request only - it kind of tasted like chewy spam. I particularly liked the buttermilk steak and Moroccan spicy chicken. Anything with the cheese was also very juicy and tender but a tad salty. My friends also enjoyed the chimichurri prime ribs. Lamb and beef ribs only came out once, which was a bit of let down as we did enjoy those. As a whole, the meats were well flavored, tender, and very juicy. Everything was cooked until a medium rare which I loved.

The pineapple really lived up to my expectations - dusted with a bit of cinnamon and perhaps sugar, it had slightly crunchy edges and was very sweet. Our table loved it and we asked for seconds the next couple times they came around. Definitely something you should try. It would have been nice to have a small selection of fresh fruits after the seriously heavy meal though. 

For the price, this restaurant is something you'd want to try at least once, and for a special occasion only (they charged us a dollar each for water with no notice). Their focus is really on the meats, and that's where you get the most bang for your buck. Go on an empty stomach and you'll have a great time sampling their Rodizio grilled meats."}
{"text":"First time I came here when they first opened everything was perfect. They really let themselves go after being open for a while with their organization. I had a reservation for 8 people two weeks ago for a birthday and once I got there we all waited 2 hours after the reserved time. The hostess then walked us to the table and said do you recognize any of these people at this table. We didn't know anyone sitting at the table and those people just stared at us awkwardly as she pointed at them. Very disappointing. Then she told us to go back to the front desk and wait again. After telling the manager how disorganized everything was all she said was I'm sorry while smiling. No professionalism at all. There were no birthday specials given. From now on I think I will be eating at toro."}
{"text":"The food was so good. The top stirloin and the rib steak were my favourite and and the sides were great too. I don't think I need to mention the pineapple, it's a no brainer. The deep fried banana tho is a total miss they can just remove it from the menu all together. No one needs additional dessert because by the time you finish you won't have any desire or space left for dessert."}
{"text":"Came here for a Christmas party in 2015 with staff members. We were complaining that this place is so far, which it is but quickly realized that it was kind of worth the drive. 

Meat tasted wonderful! The servers came around often and asked if we wanted anything else other than meat. We said shrimp but were told that they ran out of shrimp. It was only 8:30pm.... The only other option was pineapple. 

The buffet area was great. All you can eat cheese, prosciutto and much more!"}
{"text":"Festive
The copacabana was great. From the old fashioned at the bar on second floor to the grilled meat, everything was good. There was dancers and acrobatic shows all night. However, it is booked very fast and very crowdy. There was an hour of wait. it is expensive too"}
{"text":"For the Toronto location, This is a place of meat and class and they did a good job of both. The food remains the same as the other locations so no change there but the decorum was definately upscale comparatively.

Logistically The servers did an excellent job continually touching base with the table. Albeit a slow start probably due to multiple sits they nailed it after ten min and with seperate cash out servers, beer servers and food servers, the service is actually top notch

Decorum was georgeous for this location. Great for a $$$ plus to $$$$ for sure.

Food was awesome. This place is a meat market for generalist meat lovers. Great for group parties. The drinks could use a touch up overall though very pleased!"}
{"text":"If you're a big meat lover this is definitely the place for you! They have a good variety of side dishes though none of them really stood out (their mashed potatoes were particularly underwhelming). But the meats! Loved the rub on all the various steaks and they were all cooked a nice medium rare. Their chicken was undercooked but everything else made up for it.  Be sure to pair these meats with a nice red wine (Shiraz goes really well). I went at 8 pm and around that time they bring out their Brazilian dancers for entertainment. They came out again around 9:30 with even sexier costumes. Overall a good experience, but be sure to make reservations!"}
{"text":"What a nice place.  The salad bar and other selections were very good. So good that you have to be careful not to load up before the meat comes!  The stuff is fun and engaging.  The price was fair relative to other Brazilian steak houses.  We asked for custom pieces of meat which they readily prepared."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. The venue is beautiful and the food there is delicious! The self-serve buffet had the salads and sides which were delicious. You can tell everything was freshly made and of top quality. The waiters come around with freshly roasted cuts of meat really often and slice a bit of meat off their roast for you. This way, you can try every single cut of meat (and there are A LOT). They also take requests if a certain meat from their menu hasn't come yet so you definitely won't be missing out on any menu item! The meal itself is a bit pricey ($40+tips/taxes) BUT it's worth the money since the meat is of very good quality and you get to sample so many different cuts! You can find all the cuts of meat they serve on their website. 

The service there is great as well. Everyone is very accommodating and ready to serve you. They also check up on you often so you have every opportunity to make meat requests upon requests!"}
{"text":"While the food was great, with an excellent buffet to accompany the meats,  I have a few minor quibbles with this place that prevents me from rating it higher.  First, the meats were delicious but overly salted in an obvious attempt to get you to buy more drinks (which are expensive here).  If you are on a low-sodium diet, please consider going to a regular steakhouse where the meat is not brought out salted instead.  Second, and more important:  We were seated towards the window in front.  The servers consistently came to our table last and often with not much left on their skewers.  This did not change till we complained about it, but that was well through our visit and we were beginning to fill up already.  My belief is that they seat people based on whom they decide they will visit more and with fuller skewers.  I did not like that.

As far as the food goes, it was typical Brazilian steakhouse with a variety of meats and grilled pineapple.  They also brought some tasty little cheese balls, sweet corn bread, and fried bananas.  Buffet had only two items that were actually Brazilian in nature:  A good though somewhat mildly seasoned feijoa and cassava chips (rather bland).  The rest of it had some nice offerings, however, with some really excellent bread.  

Dancers were fun though the show was not very long."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out despite all the bad reviews I read on here. I came here last night with 5 of my girlfriends. 

The moment you walk in you instantly feel like your entering another world. The place itself is very chic, from its decor to the gorgeous people working there downright to the vibe.

I swear everyone that works here is gorgeous. I found the hostesses and waitresses to be very friendly and helpful, even the ladies working behind the buffet.

I was really impressed by my Sex on the Beach. I asked them for my double shot of vodka and the drink was really strong just like I like it. I can't tell you how many times I go to other restaurants and ask for my double shot only to find the drink so watered down.

Let's talk about the food now.. I don't even have enough to time to talk about it. Every single item I tasted at the buffet was so fresh.. The mashed sweet potato and kale salad was off the chain good!

I found the Gauchos to be very friendly as well. They really did a good job of making sure every table got a portion. 

Other Yelpers were correct though about the meat being extremely salty. I only found one meat having this issue, it was one of the steaks but other than that the meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The ones that really stood out to me was the lamb, spicy chicken and the flank steak.. Omg YUM!!

Their was a girl working behind the buffet who was cooking the cheese buns and when I didn't want to wait till they came out of the oven she actually had them sent upstairs for me and my friends. 

The dancers were unreal. Their dancing was lovely and very uplifting. The music they play here is very nice too. Towards the end of the evening when it got close to 9:30 they opened there windows and the summer breeze mixed with ambience and music was delightful.

I'm really looking forward to bringing other people here! I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"This is a higher end restaurant with a great atmosphere and entertainment.  Buffet downstairs with antipasti, breads, pastas and salads and a unique twist where they serve you the protein right to your table via barbecued scurries.  The meat is sliced into your plate.  I did find the price expensive as my bill came to almost $90 with tip and I only had one drink.  But it is downtown Toronto for 1,  2nd at no point did our party of 20 have to ask for anything.  Service was bang on and the meat was consistently coming.  I think this is a great place to go with a group of people that are hungry!  And enjoy a finer meal with some great entertainment.  Definitely a quality and quantity place!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I booked this place for a birthday celebration for around 10 people. The reservation process was kind of tedious: reservations needed to be made with a credit card, deposit $100 bucks, you had to ensure exactly 10 people were going to show up and no less - they will charge you the full price of someone that doesn't show up. And frankly, when you have that many people, it is hard to ensure that everyone is going to make it/be on time. But regardless, the 2 hour time limit starts immediately when your reservation time is. And because of those processes, I really disliked the lack flexibility at this restaurant. 

When we got to the restaurant, the hostesses took forever to get a table for us. Despite the fact that there were 5 hostesses standing around, only one of them had the ability to check us in. And because there was a 2 hour limit, that waiting around did not allow us extended time (although to be fair, 2 hours was plenty). 

Other than the unpleasant beginning experiences, the food itself was really good. I loved the variety of food received and the performance during the middle of the dinner was great as well. The meats were delicious, although I wouldn't say the best steaks I've ever had, but the variety made up for it. The side dishes/buffet area was dece - a lot of selection but again, the actual flavour of the food was just okay.

Definitely somewhere I'd go again for a special occasion just for the experience. But if you're going for high quality steak, there are better steakhouses in the city."}
{"text":"We have been to several Brazilian restaurants but this was probably the worst. Gauchos were not friendly at all and they did not know their meats. Flank steak was Picana. Also very slow service.For the hefty price we expected better. Would rather drive to Buffalo for Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the food I'd give Copacabana negative stars for their horrendous service. 

My boyfriend booked their downtown location for 6pm for a special occasion and we had gone in hoping for an enjoyable time. It was everything but that. First of all we were seating literally inches away from two other customers so it was incredibly awkward and difficult to converse

The real issue began 1.5 hours after we were seated. Halfway through our meal, we were asked to leave since our seating limit was up. We knew we had 2hrs, so we told them it wasn't even time yet. The hostess apologized and left, but twenty minutes later she told us we had to leave because we were seated in an area that was supposed to hold a party of 30 and they had already arrived. 

First of all, why would you place us in this seating area if you knew it was going to coincide with other reservations

Second of all, we were trying to finish our beers and our seating time hadnt even been up yet. They literally took away our cups and started to clear the table before we even got up. if we had known we were going to be rushed out, we wouldn't have given them the 18% tip 

terrible 

the only good part of copa is the guys who come around with the slabs of meat, theyre super friendly and generous"}
{"text":"First time to a Brazilian steakhouse. For a Monday it was packed! Be sure to make a reservation. Definitely a good sign. 
The side dishes were awesome with lots of variety. 
The meat, non stop!! Ate so much I feel sick, what a great selection!
Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"This place was okay. The salad bar could have been better. The meat was salty as expected at these Brazilian steak houses, so I usually rate them on the salad bar."}
{"text":"Meat on Meat on Meat.
Vegans beware, this isn't the place for you. I absolutely have nothing bad to say except for me. I have zero control here because everything is so damn good!
They bring you these Portuguese cheese biscuits to start and then then the fun begins - the meat flows like there's no tomorrow. Although you can cool down on the meat or heat up (meaning you can take a break from eating or ask for more)
They have a delicious salad bar as well and they even have live music and live Brazilian dancers 
I 100% will be back"}
{"text":"This was my second time being here with a large group and I definitely had a very satisfying experience.

Staff: They were seated us up stairs on the top floor. There were a few hiccups with the table setting and they were short on clean water glasses. But they were forthcoming with the information and were very apologetic. For the most part people were checking up on us constantly and clearing plates. The food people came by much more frequently than my previous experience. Obviously there were lulls but the staff would also allow us to make requests. So even though it wasn't perfect the service provided by the staff was pretty good.

Ambience: I think being on the top floor is the way to go. Dancers were much more immersed with the people. And they had the big screen playing the All Star Weekend events. You can't see the silk dancer but many people take a moment to look over the railings for a nice view. I think the entertainment was much more enjoyable with the layout of the top floor (mostly tables), whereas the middle floor has the buffet so the layout blocks views of the entertainment at certain spots, plus people are constantly walking to the buffet. The seats are very comfortable and I didn't feel squished, however the music was very loud.

Food: I am not a huge fan of red meats but they do it very well. Nothing was too tough or everything was very juicy. What I enjoyed the most was the other types of meats (e.g. chicken, sausage, etc.). Everything was very juicy and flavourful. The buffet on the main floor had great pastas, and breads, and veggies so it was great to have that balanced meal. The grilled pineapples always seem to be a hit so make sure you grab a slice (or two) before leaving.

Ask for seating on the top floor if possible. The meals are kind of expensive but it's nice place to go to for a celebration especially if you know people with huge appetites like my friends."}
{"text":"I had a few issues with this restaurant, but overall I really enjoyed the experience. While the staff was a little rude at times and the entertainment a little loud/disconcerting, the food more than made up for it. 

The buffet was awesome and had a great variety of items to choose from. If you are seated upstairs, just be aware that the buffet in on the ground floor, so you will have to carry your (very full) plates up the stairs. If you're clumsy, maybe ask to be seated downstairs!

It was very busy when I went (I think a Friday evening) so be prepared for a lot of noise and navigating around people. Definitely make a reservation!

Servers with meat on big skewers walk around offering meat to all the guests. This really reminded me of my visit to Brazil. I found the servers to be a little curt to newcomers unsure of when and how to grab the meat to transfer to their plates. Despite having the blue/red coasters explained to us by our server (facing one way means you'd like more meat, facing another means you're OK for now), I found that the servers completely disregarded them and kept offering more meat, which meant they kept interrupting the meal and conversation. 

About halfway through the meal, loud music started playing which I think most people first assumed was a mistake with the audio, but we later realized that there was actually a dance performance taking place downstairs, which later moved upstairs.

I think the added entertainment during dinner is a really neat idea and definitely adds to the evening's experience. That being said, I think it was too loud and went on a little too long, plus I personally don't really want to see half naked women dancing vigorously while I'm stuffing my face at a buffet! But to each their own!"}
{"text":"Good food, but setup is not the greatest, love the Eglinton location as I find the meats come around so much faster and much more selection"}
{"text":"Meat fest...be ready for the meat sweats!  If you're a red meat fan, this place is definitely for you.  Their cuts are delicious and the way they grill their meats are interesting - there's one where they integrated cheese in their sirloin - I mean, how can you go wrong with that?  They also have a huge salad and bread bar, which makes for a good break from all these meats.  They also have a capoeira and salsa dance show, which is very entertaining.  Their chicken was really not worth eating (esp when you're paying $55) and their salmon was okay.  The pineapple was absolutely delicious.  

Overall, for $55, it was a very expensive meat fest and I don't think I ate $55 worth of meat, despite having literally had no lunch and went in starving.  Definitely go in with an absolutely empty stomach and be prepared to eat LOTS to make it worth your while!"}
{"text":"Came here for my brother's birthday and it was great!  Tip for everyone, you unfortunately have to go on the day of your birthday - not 24 hours ahead, not 24 hours later because they would not honour my brother's birthday (despite the fact that it was literally hours later).  

The variety of meats were great (similar to the DT Copa) but for some reason, the servers kept skipping our table until we started at them intently - and YES, we had our \"let them eat meat\" sign on.  One waitress was actually particularly nice and she took the time and effort to get whatever we wanted, including those fried banana dessert bites!   

Overall, I would visit this place again.  I just really wished they honoured that birthday thing because literally, it was a day away and they really easily could devise a system where people can't cheat it."}
{"text":"I recently came here for a business dinner. From the outside it looks like the restaurants closed since there are  sheets of wood covering the outside. When you go inside, it's a beautiful restaurant. Which shows Coba since it's relatively close to Pearson airport. We started very early before 5 o'clock. We are the first ones there. I've been to other Brazilian steak houses so I know how this works. As with others we started in the salad bar. I was very surprised how fresh everything was. Maybe it was because we are the first ones there. The selection was quite small but I wasnt disappointed since I typically don't eat a lot of salad at steakhouses. Once we sat down with our salads, the meat start coming over. After about for five different meats, we did flip the card to the stop side so we can have our business conversation without being constantly interrupted. It surprised me that none of the meat servers even noticed that we flipped the cards. That was probably the only disappointment for being at this restaurant. Everything else is great. I have to say that in some the other Brazilian steakhouse is the meats didn't seem as fresh. Everything seem that was coming straight from the ovens and was well-prepared. Other than ignoring the flipped cards, service was great."}
{"text":"3.5/5

I've been to the Eglinton location twice and was planning to go during Christmas Day, however they were closed that day. Therefore we decided to try out the downtown location and compare between the two steakhouses.

I'll begin with the service...the organization/management is bottom-notch. The setup of the restaurant was already poor, with a lack of seating in the lower level, forcing many customers to sit in the upper level. The problem was there was a lack of seats available for 5 people, so the receptionist forced us in a booth of 8, but we were only allowed to use up half the booth. It should be noted throughout the whole duration of the stay, nobody sat in the other half...so why couldn't we have used up the whole booth? The place wasn't that busy anyway for Christmas Day.

With that aside...time to enjoy the food. There are a lot more variety of steaks here compared to the Eglinton location, so that's a huge plus. To make it even better, I found the steaks here a lot more tasty and delicious compared to the Eglinton location. They use a lot more spices, herbs, and cheese to make their steaks, hence making it tastier. Some standouts include the picanha, moroccan seasoned chicken, and the prime rib with cheese.

The waitress eventually gave us free fried bananas for dessert. Not sure if it was compensation for the dreadful service earlier, but the bananas tasted quite good. Honestly after that initial mess up, the rest of the night went quite well."}
{"text":"Growing Pains ! Been to the other 3 restaurants and they are amazing ! This one just opened, the service was horrible, the food mediocre at best...served raw filet mignon wrapped in raw bacon. Wanted to get some of the guys with the meat to come by as the service was slow, talked to the waitress 3 times and it did nothing. Website showed a discount for kids under 12...the bill showed discounts only for kids up to 11. I won't be back and I would recommend that you also stay away."}
{"text":"Initially when we got here there was little meat roaming around. We waited for a while because we were only interested in chicken, lamb and shrimps. Beef was frequent but for people who don't eat it, be prepared to wait 30 mins as the chicken and lamb take longer to cook.

After requesting chicken and lamb and expressing our disappointment in lack of any, our waitress and servers made up for it by bringing us a variety of chicken and lamb once it was ready. The chicken and lamb were very good. 

I understand that sometimes things may not start off perfectly but the staff did a very good job of ensuring we enjoyed our meal going forward."}
{"text":"You can't call yourself a meat lover and not pay a visit to Copacabana. 

Ambiance-
The location on Adelaide has a club feel to the resto - there is aerial dance going on in the centre, and Brazilian showgirls in the background.  Music is blasted and at some points you just wanna leave the plateful of delicious steak in front of you and dance.. except you can't, 'cause..

Food-
The meat is amazing.  I just don't see how someone could possibly be a vegetarian after having tried anything here.  The way it's served goes like this:  AYCE bar on the first floor with appetizers (delicious varieties of bread, prosciutto), salad, lasagna, etc. that you can plate yourself.  Then, once you sit, lots of servers come around with the Brazilian-style meats that this steakhouse is known for and carve the meat right into your plate.  I accidentally took the meat with my own fork once, but obviously for sanitation purposes they gave you mini-tongs to pick off the meat that the servers give you.

A few memorables that I had one slice too many:
Skirt Steak Dry Rub - The dry rub was done so well.  Unf, that flavour.
Chimichurri Steak - I like this Argentine sauce. A lot.
Prime Rib with Cheddar - Can't go wrong with cheese
Parmesan Filet Mignon - See above
Salmon - Fatty, rich, and melts in your mouth
Butter Milk Rib-Eye - The cut of ribeye was perfect, didn't really taste the buttermilk but it was perfect. 
Filet Mignon Wrapped in Bacon - I'm a bacon fan so this just wasn't fair.
Moroccan Chicken - I had more of this chicken than the top sirloin or flank steak, 'cause the seasoning was that good.  A bit spicy but that good.
Pork Sausage - I like sausages, but I'd stick with the Italians for'em
Leg of Lamb - This was alright, might be 'cause I had this towards the beginning of a food coma commenced by the items above.
Roasted Pineapple - WHAT IS THIS BLACK MAGIC.  Pretty sure they roasted this with brown sugar and cinnamon yet it tasted like heaven in my mouth.  I cannot eat a regular pineapple again.

Service-
The servers were tall dark and handsome.  ..I mean.. they were really friendly and attentive :)  Reservation is needed since even when we made a reservation a week beforehand, we still had to wait around 20min for  table .. for some reason.  It was nice to wait at the bar though, a bartender offered us complimentary fries and onion rings.  Lols.  

Price tag is a bit hefty so save the steakhouse for a special occasion - around $60/person.  Worth every bit of it, though; I'd go again next time I feel like ending a diet :P"}
{"text":"The service was impeccably slow. There was one server serving about ten to twelve tables. She tried to come around the best she could to our table but it was not often enough. The Men Who were bringing out the meats seemed like they were always in a hurry and skipping over our table. The buffet itself was decent but very very small compared to Texas de Brazil and or Fogo de Chao this place is a three-star compared to those places but the reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because they value of the entertainment. There were some dancers who came out to entertain the gas and it made the visit here worthwhile. It seems like everybody was dressed up and out of their element and dress to impress and I like the Ambiance at this place gave. But the service was less than stellar for the price"}
{"text":"The food is great
But good luck with ending up eating few pieces of meet
They come so late by late to your late and by the time they come for you are full already of salad bar
So basically you never get to eat as much as one steak in total 
Service is really bad
My tongue fell down and i asked 5 times to get another and nobody brought me one and i used my husband 's to tye end of the dining
Waste of money"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Brazilian Steakhouse, my boyfriend had been to one in the States and had a great time so I decided to take him to Copacabana for our second anniversary. The experience was great, I loved the salad bar, there was a coconut, cranberry bread that I was in love with! My one complaint about the salad bar would be that the muscles came with a solid spoon as opposed to one with some holes in it for the sauce to run out of. My suggestion would be to grab a separate plate for them to avoid mushy salad and bread. 
The service when we got to the restaurant was really slow, the waiters were catering to the bigger parties and leaving us in the dust. The service did pick up later on and we got to try everything that was on the menu. 
I loved the grilled pineapple, the waiters know throughout your stay what you like, that was really nice. 
And in the end, Brazilian Trio for desert, get this or regret it for the rest of your life. I wish I could explain what this desert tasted like but it is beyond words."}
{"text":"Just awful. Inequitable guest experience; meat carvers didn't come around nearly as often as guests who got seated after us and coincidentally seated right next to us. Got the manager involved and while he was nice, my guest and I were fed up and decided to leave."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and enjoyed my experience. The decor here is very nice and the staff were great. We came for dinner and were entertained by the dancers and acrobat which performed midway through our dinner. I enjoyed all the meats and wish I could've eaten more! I especially enjoyed the lamb and my boyfriend loved the parmesan steak. It was also nice that their salad/ side dish bar had plenty of selection. Try the cheesy bread, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"You have to break this restaurant into three different channels to get the full picture. First, let's talk about the atmospheres....really cool place. Fast paced & busy with entertainment that's included, that's the really neat part. The second part is the food end. The buffet is the only option for food & it's $45.00/pp!! That wouldn't have been a problem except the delivery of the Brazilian Style BBQ meat. All the meat was very tasty but it took FOREVER to get it. I flagged down multiple servers asking for additional meat & was told the same thing each time, \"right away\" but the right away was way too slow for my taste. We missed a variety of different food (pineapples, salmon, chicken) because of slow servers or a slow kitchen. The third part is the lower level...it's quiet (compared to upstairs) & serves a seafood theme mix....we weren't told that part but it's included so we missed it. I guess the learn from this is to ask more questions!! I would go again but just not on Saturday nite the service sucked & they missed the mark on food quantity."}
{"text":"Copa Cabana is a nice spot to go when you are in dire need of meat. 

The dinning room is spacious and on 2 levels. The decor is modern and tasteful. Only drawback is that their leather chairs and benches have a lot of black tape to cover the cuts. Doesn't look so refined.

As for the food they do have a wonderful buffet of sides! From salads to rice and potatoes and a great assortment of cold cuts and cheeses. As tempting as they are don't stock up too much on them so you can enjoy the meats. 

On our visit we were proposed a choice of about 6 beef, 2 chicken, 1 fish, 1 shrimps and the traditional pineapple.  Favorite one would be the mozzarella infused roasted beef. The other cuts were still very juicy and flavorful. 

The servers were great and asked us often if there was a certain type of meat that we wanted. 

They do have these little cardboard that indicates if you want them to offer you meat or stop but we found out they don't really look at it and still come at your table anyways. 

We went as a couple but would definitely suggest you go as a big group instead."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening, highly recommend reservations. Around 6 ish it was getting pretty packed. The meats... to die for... all the steaks from top sirloin, prime rib, flank steak, filet mignon was all tender and flavoured perfectly. Just thinking about it... is making me drool. The chicken was also tender and moist and the lamb chops are a must try. The shrimps was okay, and the salad bar and hot bar wasn't the greatest. Not very fresh and not much variety. I would definitely come back for the meats, just amazing. At the end of the night they gave us a 15% off on the next visit but it's only valid for 7 days which is kind of ridiculous ... they should extend that."}
{"text":"GIVE ME MORE PINEAPPLES! I came on a weekday and was surprised how busy the restaurant was. It was a great experience and I would recommend.
The steaks were very tasty but was not properly introduced, so towards the middle of your dinner you'd find yourself asking whether it you ate that or not...LOL
The buffet was good, but the tables are setup such that it's not very convenient if you are on the inside...so I only got 1 round of the buffet. Cheese bread was to die for! (Waste of room, I know) You find yourself eating this doughy goodness and can't figure whether you're biting on cheese or bread - great strategy Copacabana ;)
My personal favourite was the cheddar stuffed steak, some half round shaped steak and chicken drumstick. Pineapple is usually my fav in Brazilian BBQs but it hardly came to our table so I was very disappointed. We would make requests but every time there were so little that came, it couldn't make it through half the table.
Dancers were fun, came twice during our meal. Would 100% come again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Although they try and fill you up on salads so you don't eat meat. I go with my husband on date nights but we can barely hear eachother it's so loud. Music is loud. Also when we ask to bring more steak the waiter forgot us and started bringing it to another table."}
{"text":"I visited this location for my birthday dinner on a Saturday and had a fairly decent dining experience. 

Upon first impression from the outside I was completely thrown off. The exterior is kit up in neon blue lights with little to no direction as to where the front door is. After making an awkward nightclub like entrance, we were quickly seated with your reservations (Saturday ressos - heck ya!). Drinks were prompt and the salad bar was fully loaded. I didn't think they were lacking anything and the food laid out was fresh. I especially liked the mashed potatoes and garlic cheese bread. 

My fave cut of meat was the ribeye followed closely behind by the sirloin. Delish! I've had a better picana (spelling?) Steak elsewhere in Richmond Hill. I also felt their cinnamon pineapple could've used some cinnamon coating. The cornbread muffin was wicked good. I wish the shrimp came by more often; seemed like they went to every table but ours. When they visited ours a measly piece was left leaving me wanting many, many more. 

The atmosphere is loud and not the best place if you like to have conversations. I may sound like I didn't enjoy myself and although I really did, the nightclub feel didn't leave me during the entire experience. 

The belly dancing was cool tho!

Would I go back? Yeah, probably... But it wouldn't be my first suggestion for a night out. Still giving a four star because the food was great.

They do make a mean Manhattan though."}
{"text":"Went for my friend's birthday dinner. Love the meat and of course the famous pineapple. They have a good salad bar for vegetarians too."}
{"text":"Highly suggested to make reservations ahead of tie

Went there for dinner with 5 people. 

Ambiance: The place is pretty modern.  The waiters come to your table with meat (or pineapple) on a large skewer and give you a piece) if you want.  
The choice of meat is pretty good, from chicken, to steak, to sausage, to steak with cheese....  
They also have dancers coming out and dancing for 10-15 minutes every 2 hours, which is a nice bonus.  

Service:
The waiters come frequently and are really friendly.  [They do say that everything is really good]  

Food: 
The food is really good, the choice of different meats definitely makes it an interesting dinning experience.  



Cons:
- If you are trying to have a private conversation this is not the place to do it.  The constant arrival of waiters will not give you the desired privacy."}
{"text":"The meat is always great at Copa...but god damn the service is bad. They gave us seats with no plates and no utensils, and the meat people were already coming up to us but we couldn't even accept. Also received the ugliest Old-Fashioned by the bartender. Couldn't even finish it and it left my hands super sticky."}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers for brunch today. It was my first time here but they came before and had only good things to say. The food was delicious. I really enjoyed the crepes and the omelette that were done right in front of you with your choices of toppings. The freshly baked butter were also delicious. Of course I could not let the meat pass by so I tried almost everything the server offered us on a skewer. By the end of the meal I had tried almost everything they had to offer and was full. I will definitely come again, maybe at night to see one of their shows."}
{"text":"Not my first time here and again was reminded of what I like and dislike about the restaurant.

Pro:
Something unique and different - the meat is grilled in the Brazilian style and served on spits, the concept is that one can eat as much as one wants as the waiters bring the different meats to you off the grill. Your blue or red coasters signal whether you want more meat.
Impressive d√©cor and ambiance - dim, chic, not mixed up and tacky at all
Choice of meats and salad bar - the unlimited salad bar is in fact as good as any buffet with many choices and the meats, cheese ball and fried pineapple are all different and varied.
On weekends and holidays they have Brazilian dancing. The dancers are not very good, but the flamboyance and interaction are fun for sure (unless you hate samba).
The waitress (who took care of dishes and drinks) was a thin and young lady who was sweet and polite. I couldn't place her accent.

Cons:
Just like the last time the multiple hostesses take your sweet time ushering you in. Is it a time limit trick? Is it that their reservation system is using Windows 98? Is it that their screen is actually interfaced with the owner who personally has to order the hostess to take you to a certain table and, well, sometimes he is sleeping at home or is in the washroom or whatever and so guests have to wait for his return so the hostess can receive instructions?? Are they checking you out to strategically decide where to put you (even though you have a reservation) so they maximize their profit??
This time not only our group had to wait the usual wait, but also our group was taken up five steps before being returned to the front so the hostess can review the screen, what??
The meat is obviously bad for you. The amount of salt sprinting up and down your tongue and throat is obscene. I am sure, I assume, this is Brazilian food, which is fine, but be warned. 
The price is $50/person.
Worst of all, even if you are there for two hours the carvers stop coming after the first hour. Just test it yourself. After about 15 minutes of sitting you begin to see your waiters and the meat. By the 60th minute you will see them slow down and not come to you anymore. Never mind, that they are ignoring their own blue or red coaster system. If you want actual steak and you want to decide how much to have go to Hy's or The Keg.

Favourite meat: sirloin
Least favourite item: fried pineapple"}
{"text":"We have now been to all three Copacabana locations in the GTA, including the new on in Vaughan just a couple days ago. I change \"favourites\" like I change my underwear (which means often by the way!!:) and as of right now, Copacabana is my favourite restaurant, with the downtown location being my favourite of the three.

Yes its a bit pricey at $50 per person, but the meat, oooooooh the meat!!! So many varieties, perfect seasonings, a great buffet of sides, and did I mention the meat?? Carved tableside so you get just the right amount to taste of each variety that comes by, and don't worry, they all come around several times so you can have as much as you like of whatever you like!!

Dont forget the most amazing grilled pineapple glazed with cinnamon and brown sugar (I believe). This is great after the meal or in between bites of meat as a palate cleanser, or both!!

Go with three other paying people and its free on Your Birthday as well!!!

On top of all this, they have incredible entertainment. Brazilian dancers make their way through the restaurant, and this location has a silk rope acrobatic act which is amazing!! The rope hangs down from the second floor to the first so spectators gather around the spiral staircase to watch while they are letting the meat settle, in preparation for more meat!!!::))

I Love This Place!!!!!::))"}
{"text":"I loved it. Wish could be here more often. Went during weekday so missed out on the belly dancers.  I did not like the service at all since I had to ask numerous times for something and was also my birthday with a table of ten and did not get the advertised birthday comp since I did not have an ID for my surprise dinner. the bill was also oddly split and didn't seem correct The way it was done. Sometimes you can't have it all. Cest la vie.


Service subpar 
Food great
Atmosphere great"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to the venue for AYCE with a dining out social Group.  My first two visits were for dinner and this one was for Brunch.  First of all I fairly filled my plate with vegetables available at the buffet. Then the meat started coming (it was delivered 'skewer style') and that was certainly the highlight of my meal. I managed to return to the buffet at the end for little helpings of mac & cheese and lasagna as well as a chocolate chip cookie and a white chocolate macadamia cookie; all 4 items were delicious, as was everything else I had. Although the 2nd floor became pretty packed w/other patrons while we were there, I enjoyed yet another great value with great service."}
{"text":"Me and my friends decided to go check out this AYCE steakhouse because we always passed by it on the street, and it was always packed. Tl;dr: it was very worth it.
Once we got in and talked to the receptionist about our reservations, we were seated very quickly. After that, the service was excellent and explained to us how the restaurant worked. There is a buffet section with delicious sides, pasta, breads, cheese, etc which you can grab on your own, and they bring a stream of meats to your table at your desire. The food was a 4.5/5, with the top sirloin steak and the house special steak standing out. Some other notables were the pineapple, bread with garlic butter, and the filet mignon. One problem was that the food came super quickly and us being avid eaters, we became full super quickly! Wanting to get value out of the AYCE is definitely not the best way to enjoy this restaurant, it's best to take it slow and try some of everything. Overall, the atmosphere was nice and the servers were good. 4.5/5 but 5 stars for rounding! :)"}
{"text":"We went here for a friends birth day, we were a large group so we were placed in a \"private room\" it was so dark you could barley see anything there was a huge tv in the room and it was so bright it was hurting everybody's eyes . We were 4 different tables so when they would bring the meat it would only be one person at a time so they would leave and come back again but it would be a different meat so half of us didn't get to try to same thing till much later when we complained and they send more ppl to us !! 
So there is salad, pesto and potato (mashed, fries .. ) bar all you can eat but don't fill your self up on that .
If you are going with a group there is the 15% gratuity which made my meal including a pop $68.  Way over priced for what they have ! 
And there is no show on Sunday's just Saturday !"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with amazing food! I definitely recommend making a reservation especially on weekends! They fill up to capacity very quickly! The Brazilian dancers are beautiful to watch but unfortunately not all tables have a view. There was a silk show when I was there as well but I couldn't see it from where we were seated. The buffet has a lot of options but it's downstairs, which means if you're enjoying the view from the upper level, it's a little bit of a hike to go walk through all the tables and go downstairs to get your food. The cheddar rib eye is a must try from the meats!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. Terrible service!! The waitress keeps asking us if we are done with it. They were trying to give us repeated foods all the time but skipping our table when they got something new. We had to ask them to stop to get the food!! Worst experience ever for having Brazilian bbq. Never go there again ABSOLUTELY!!"}
{"text":"I was out there last night celebrating a friend's bday.
It took 30 to get our table although we had a reservation. 
Once seated everything was close to perfect though.
The food is excellent and the service attentive. 
If I was to find any negatives it'd be that the volume could be turned down a bit and the entertainment segments could be a little more elaborate.
Great night overall."}
{"text":"The worst service that I have ever received in a restaurant. You have to wait an hour after every steak they bring took us 3 hours to eat here not because we are slow to eat,no. Because of the bad service and the rude manager Melan. Won't recommend coming here save ur money for a better place with better food and service."}
{"text":"Let me get this straight, I email to make reservations 2 weeks prior and I call 2 days before to check, turns out there's no table for me. Birthday dinner plans ruined. I get an email back a week later implying I made a typo for November instead of October. Come on what type of service is this, it doesn't take a genius to check the date of an email. I'm usually not the type to give negative feedback but this is beyond careless from what I've experienced."}
{"text":"This is the second time going to this restaurant with the same group of people. Both times we went during the week. The place is lively, it is supposed to be better on the weekend but very busy and a reservation is recommended. We were seated right away - no reservation. The first time was better service. This place you have a buffet but the meat is brought to you table on Squwers . We were waiting this time a lot for them to bring meat.  The meat is tasty when you get it. The buffet is good, but it's the meet that we were there for. The waitresses provide excellent service but the guys with the meat going from table to table were monopolized by a few tables. Sit by the kitchen to get the best service. The staff is friendly. We were there for 2 hours until we finally had enough to eat. Oh yes, it's all you can eat!"}
{"text":"I think this type of place really rely on good staff, you need all your meat bring to your table. The staff tonight was excellent, very friendly and tentative. We also got a great table. I would give the service tonight a 5.

As for the meat itself, I liked the parmesan filet mignon, but most of the meat was on the salty side. Do not say yes to the flank steak.

All in all I'm happy. My bodybuilder bf was really happy becasue he for once got enough meat to eat..."}
{"text":"A meat-lover's paradise!  

I can't remember the last time I had a meal that was so satisfying in so many different ways.  We came on a Friday night & they were expectedly very busy.  Despite this, the meat flowed plentifully, and the variety of meats coming around was impressive.  

Each and every meat dish that came around seemed to get better & better - the House Steak and the bacon-wrapped filet mignons probably were the top guns here.  I also can't say enough about the gluten-free cheese bun and the pineapple to finish things off!  So much choice!  And to top it off, even their vegetables were delicious!!  At a steak house!!!!  

Service was top notch, and the manager came around to describe to us what was & wasn't gluten-friendly.  Overall, this place is a must visit - I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"When a person is in an AYCE Brazilian steakhouse and has to go to the SALAD BAR 3 times coz they were hungry, something is wrong! Worst of all, the servers would come, serve 3/4 of your friends, tell you they'll be back and don't come. Actuslly no, the worst part is them returning x minutes later, serving again the same 3/4 people and then leaving you with the same message. I was so pissed off and the only reason why I didn't complain to the manager is because it was my friend's birthday! There can be no excuse as they were there at the table and serving evryone except my side of the table (2 other people didn't get food either). I have been here before, even during busier times it was never this bad!"}
{"text":"How is everyone rating this place so high in a city of great restaurants?! Horrible service (my friend and I felt invisible because the next table was assisted by the server at a 3:1 ratio to us). No one could tell me what is actually in the food that wasn't meat until I hounded the server enough to find out more from the manager. And Brazilian cheese bread made properly is SUPPOSED TO BE GLUTEN FREE. I could have paid the same price for a meal at Cafe Boulud and had better wine, better service and arguably better food (I use that restaurant in comparison because of the marquis chef name attached to it). I spent $85 for a cocktail, a terrible glass of red wine and some grilled vegetables and meat. I was really looking forward to trying this place after having a fantastic experience at a different Brazilian steakhouse by a different name in Detroit on NYE (by the way - the one in Detroit completely blows this place away in service, quality, selection and knowledge on what's in the food). 

One positive - the carvers who bring the different cuts of meat to the table are friendly, helpful and the sole reason I left any sort of tip for this meal.

Let me be clear - I have no issue paying a lot of money for a good meal that is accompanied by a great experience and have paid significantly more for a meal than I did last night at this place. But as you climb in price points, your expectations increase in how well you're looked after and how well the serving staff know what they are serving. The service I received last night is what I'd expect from a Jack Astors or a Boston Pizza level of restaurant and I've received better service from restaurants at that level than I did last night at Copacabana.

Also - charging for water?! And not telling the table that you are charging for it?! SERIOUSLY? After travelling in developing countries for 8 months and having to rely on bottled water religiously, I came back with an appreciation of how fortunate we are to be in a country that we can drink the tap water safely and absolutely loathe paying for water. Seeing that on the bill last night was really the final straw for me - especially after not being told it came at a charge on top of the $11 I paid for one of the worst glasses of wine I've been served in a restaurant since I was 19 and didn't know better."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to one of these brazillian steak houses.  I really enjoyed the food and loved the variety they had at the \"salad bar\".  The staff were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"If you have never been to Brazilian \"churrascaria\" and have the money, it is a convenient location and the overall experience is there (plus the typical dance shows, if they are your thing). Meat selection is hit-or-miss - I came in days where classic staples (like \"lingui√ßa\") weren't available, and servers don't come nearly as often as a typical Brazilian place, and special requests are often ignored. You may consider an alternative like Rodeo."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall. Best thing about this place are the pineapples... I'd rather take my money to a steakhouse instead.

Don't get me wrong, the experience itself is fun - There is a short live performance with dancers and an acrobat. Waiters come around the tables to slice off various kinds of meats from various cuts of steak to chicken, lamp and shrimp. Some waitresses also came by to ask if we were waiting on any specific kinds of meat. The service here was overall quite good. 

However, I didn't like most of the meats served here. Many of them were really salty and I thought ruined the taste of the actual meat itself and would've been better without the sauce / dressing or at least less off it. The shrimp was quite good and as mentioned, the pineapples with brown sugar and cinnamon were delicious.

They also have a salad / sides bar to go with the meats.

Tips are included in the bill. Our bill was $175 for 2 people including a beer and 1/3 of a pitcher of sangria. 

Overall, it was a fun experience with a group of friends but I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely great is my opinion from one visit but it it's new and so will need to go more often . Rodozio is particularly prone to quality variation as an unreliable issue.
So far so very good 
All cuts medium rare , really tender , tasty 
And plenty of choice and quick service 
Salads very good and good quality 
Cheese bread really big and fresh ; prefer smaller but what kind of complaint is that ??
Go and enjoy 
Didn't even get to see music or dancers 
But who cares 
That's just a plus I'm sure"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday a few days ago and was very disappointed in the service we received. From the moment my party started arriving we were being rushed out the door.

I made a reservation for 4:30, one person in my party arrived at 4 and was told that if she didn't sit down we would lose the table! She let them know that the reservation was at 4:30 and that she wanted to wait to be seated until a few more people arrived. They were rude and told her to \"do what you want.\"

Once more people started to arrive, they took a seat and were then told that since they were there early that we would now only get the table until 6. I arrived promptly at 4:25 and was greeted by the hostess telling me that \"my guests were waiting and you only have two hours to eat.\"

I shrugged this off as just one rude person, but as the night went on we were faced with the same rudeness from all of the waitresses. The meat guys were good, but every single waitress that came to our table was EXTREMELY rude. It wasn't just to our table either, we saw two people ask to speak to the manager. 

Then, they added an auto-gratuity on to the bill. The waitress didn't let us know about it until after my card was in the machine. 

Also, one of the guys carrying the meat dripped grease all down my back! I didn't notice until later that night when my friends pointed it out. 

Overall, a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I general love Brazilian Steakhouses, this place is one of the better once as well.
Tip 1: first round of meat, grab a small piece of each, second round grab a bigger pieces of the stuff you liked, final round should be a big piece of the nights winner :)
Tip 2 : leave some space for the the delicious pineapple.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My family and I had visited the new location 2 weeks ago to celebrate my mothers birthday. Outside of the restaurant hadn't even been completed as of yet, We were put into a room away in the corner with a few other families, it would have been great if we had decent service. One of the servers decided to fill my moms wine glass that already had wine in it with water, the servers came around with the meat but when it came time for us to take pieces of meat or shrimp they were out, and did not replenish. A lot of the servers seemed more interested with speaking with eachother rather than help the patrons, Not to mention to get to and from the bathroom (which is tucked away at the back of the busy dining room)  took 10 minutes. For a $500 bill you'd think you'd leave there satisfied, we were all starving.  Totally disappointed, and embarrassed that we had experienced this on my mothers birthday. Needless to say we won't be back. my suggestion, take notes from your Yonge st location... They're doing it right."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the service at this location. The buffet area had plenty of options that would be sure to please even the pickiest eater. The service I had during an early Saturday dinner was incredible. The staff were attentive, my server even asked us if there was anything specifically that we wanted more of. The guys who were serving meat options were also extremely friendly. I personally felt like the galleria (buffet) had better food than most of the meat options itself. One thing that threw me a little off is that the grilled pineapple at this particular location wasn't made the same way as the other locations that I have visited. Everything else was decent, the service definitely made the experience better!"}
{"text":"If you love beef, this is your place.  It offers all-you-can eat meat served at your table.  The servers constantly come by the table offering you more meat, as if they are your mother trying to get you to eat your meat.  Make sure you come at a time where they have a capoeira and salsa dancing show.  I hear that the salad bar is also very nice.  But to be honest, I didn't even see the salad bar.  In a place like this you might be thinking: \"salad is not food.  Salad is what food eats...\"  (sorry to my vegetarian friends for the cheap humour.)

A few drawbacks:  the place is very busy, and a little tight for comfort.  Coming here with kids may not be the best option.  Also, the drinks are slow to come because all the servers are busy handling the meat.  I sometimes wonder who the restaurant remains profitable serving so much meat, and selling so little alcohol."}
{"text":"Poor reception, unprofessional.

We made a reservation for 8:30pm and according to the manager this was a system glitch. With that being said a party of 6 who also didn't have a reservation at this location was given priority over our party of 4. The argument was that they want to fill as many seats as possible.

Waitress was friendly, the food was ok considering the price.
Reception was terrible, 
The manager was receptive but no gesture was made to correct the mistake.

Avg. Price around 45$-50$ per person

Our dinner was a party of 4 and we only had 1 bottle of wine 

The bill after tax was around 300$

You be the judge"}
{"text":"Service and meats were amazing but the salad bar needs work. The AC in the back upper floor was extremely strong hitting us on the head and side making us cold and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"We made reservations for dinner for a party of 6 people and we did not get seated until 20 minutes later, and the hostesses did not do anything about it and just continued socializing with other coworkers. The food and the entertainment were good though."}
{"text":"Reservations don't matter at this place! You still gots to wait for HOURSSSSSSS. Good luck with that."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a better review, but I experienced the worst dining experience here over the weekend. 

This place is an AYCE steakhouse where they walk around with racks of a variety of steaks to serve you.Each person has a card that has two sides, red and blue. When flipped to the blue side it should automatically tell the people you'd like to be served food, and when flipped to the red side it means you're taking a break - this should all be done without having to wave the servers down. 

I came for a friend's birthday, and I must say this is the only reason why I did not complain to a Manager about my experience. We were a party of about 14 people, and there was a period of 20-30 mins where my half of the table did not get served any food- our plates were literally empty. Numerous times I watched the same servers walk by our table without even glancing over or stopping to offer us any food, and on their way back to the kitchen, same thing. I sat there for 20-30 mins waiting for someone to come, and even when you try to catch their attention its like they turn a blind eye and serve the table right next to you instead. Or they served only first half of the table and walk away. They say they will return with new steaks, but never did. It wasnt until our server came to refill our waters did she ask if everything was okay, we told her we havent had food served to us for at least 20 mins, and then i saw her tell one of the guys to bring the steaks over and the food started coming. But honestly, at that point I had already lost my appetite. That is ridiculous especially when they give you a 2 hour seating limit, well 30 mins of it was already wasted on watching the servers walk right by us. This place isn't cheap, especially when they auto grat 20%. So definitely not worth my time. Its not my first time to this location, and I've also been to other locations around Toronto, and I've run into a different kind of problem there too, where they wouldn't let us leave because they thought one person did not pay, but it was because the server double printed a bill. -__-' . but this experience really killed it for me over the weekend. I will not be returning or recommending this place to friends, especially for parties. Worst dining experience ever."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've paid $75 for these salty steak. what kind of all you can eat serve you so little meat  plus infrequent service. I think I'll rather cut the BS belly dancers & DJ and focus on food. If I want to party Ill rather go to a club. My advice in terms of quality & value just take your money to Jacobs Steak House or Richmond Station or any other greats, lots of choices @ DT."}
{"text":"It's pricey but it's really not bad if you manage to control yourself and not overeat. Once you start overeating, you lose the enjoyment of the meats that are actually tasty. I've tried another brazilian steakhouse outside of Toronto and Copacabana is definitely the better one. The salad buffet has a crazy good selection and would be great on its own (as a meatless option). My favourite meat is the parmesan crusted filet mignon ... the cheese is amazing. Definitely a special occasion type of restaurant considering the amount of food and the price."}
{"text":"Came to the restaurant with high expectations but was disappointed. The food overall was okay; the rodizio experience was definitely something exciting. However, for the price they charge for dinner I was expecting better service. The meat service was extremely slow and inattentive tonight. We were seated at a corner and throughout the night, we would see servers bringing meats to different tables around us, but 9 out of 10 times our table would be skipped. By the end of the night we only got served a few types of meats, and frankly I left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at this location since the first opening day..
The Vaughan location is simply the best one out of their 4 chain restaurants..
The food is somewhat comparable with the their other locations, but I find it better, fresher and more variety.
The service is top notch, when it's not too busy at least.
Plenty of parking, with a huge seating space inside..
The only downside here is the weekends as it gets SOO busy, and it's always best to go early to secure a table, or highly recommend calling to make a reservation, although they usually don't take reservations for smaller groups or couples.

My favourite cuts are the prime ribs with Cheddar cheese, fillet mignon with parmesan cheese, Moroccan Chicken and Flank Steak"}
{"text":"The food - the meats especially - are good, and the staff is friendly and very efficient.

Then why only 3 stars?  The atmosphere.

The music is so loud that conversation is impossible (dance music? Really?!).

Forget about having a leisurely meal, over conversation. This is about feeding you and getting you out the door ASAP.

Too bad - they'd make more on alcohol, if it was a way less rushed vibe. 

Tip:  ask for the corn bread at the bread station. They don't put it out, but it's worth asking for."}
{"text":"On the positive side, the food here is really really good. However I went there with a large group and was thoroughly unimpressed with the service. We were told that our reservation was for two hours, and at the beginning the carvers brought around lots of food, but after less than an hour we just stopped being served. We asked waitresses and carvers multiple times to keep bringing us food but we would only have one carver come by every 15+ minutes. It was very frustrating paying $55 when it really wasn't all you can eat, at all. Another note, we had vegetarians in our party who only had food from the salad bar but their bill was only $10 cheaper than the regular. 
 
In summary, food is great, but you will not get as much of it as you may want, and it's quite overpriced, especially for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Hangout here after team meeting. The environment is good for a group of people. The salad is OK, but the meat is delicious and juicy, especially the chicken thign and steak. The service is outstanding (probably because there are not many customers at that time). Pineapple is definitely must-try, as all of us like it. There are only two options for dessert: cheese ball and fried banana. PLEASE TRY CHEESE BALL when it is HOT!!"}
{"text":"Endless rounds of meat being served to you by fit, attractive male servers - how can anyone complain about an experience like that! Copacabana is definitely a worthwhile experience that one should try at least once. It might seem a bit pricey, but honestly, for all-you-can-eat, quality meat, $55+tax isn't too bad. Also if you come on a Friday or Saturday, they have live performances! We watched two different dance performances, which were actually really good and featured gorgeous costumes, and then two aerial silk routines. I would say the whole experience, which is really entertaining and fun, is worth the price.

All of the meat is obviously delicious, but I would say after eating so much, all the tastes just start to blend together and lose their distinctiveness. It can start to just feel like you're eating platefuls and platefuls of just random meat. I will say that I particularly enjoyed the prime rib with cheese (I love cheese), and the garlic chicken, as well as the salmon (fantastic) and shrimp. The service was pretty good, because the waitress (as well as the lovely men serving meat) will sometimes come and check up on you and ask if you have any particular requests for food. Also not to be forgotten is the much-raved about grilled pineapple - SO delicious.

Great place to host a birthday dinner, because you get your meal for free on your birthday!

They also have a self-serve buffet area on the first floor, which is great if you start to feel a bit overwhelmed by all the meat - load up on some salads/veg!

I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience here, and would come back, but more for the experience than anything else. Really great environment in a beautiful restaurant - we were seated on the second floor which was very lively and close to the bar, and had high ceilings and several large TVs so we could watch the Raptors game as well."}
{"text":"This was a fun little place. The food is extremely tasty and there is certainly plenty of it. The service was very good for the most part. The atmosphere was a bit loud for a dinner like this- perhaps different music choice or even just turning the music down a bit would help. If you're looking for something quiet and cozy, this isn't the best place. However, if you're craving rich meat flavors with complementing sides to go along, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Copa Cabana is a great restaurant, but Not this one in Vaughan. As others have mentioned already, the service doesn't meet the expectation. I've been to Niagara location numerous times, where the restaurant is always busy with tourists, but still provides excellent service, food, and atmosphere. The orientation of tables at this Vaughan location is horrible, with tables all close to each other. No plate, or blue/red signal paper thingy was not given until I asked after 20 minutes, and meat cycle is really slow. It sped up slightly after I've politely told our server that the serving is too slow, but this is not what I expect from $50 a person dinner. Even worse, the salad bar is not as good as other locations, with less variety, taste and presentation. If it was a $30 buffet, I may have been satisfied with this location, but not at $50 per person. I highly recommend going to another location if you are considering Copa Cabana."}
{"text":"Out of the 3 copacabanas, this one is the best in terms of ambiance. It's 2 stories - with the kitchen and buffet on the first floor and the bar on the second floor. The buffet had a good variety of items that complement meats. 

I was seated at a table by the window on the second floor, which I realized is a bad location because the meats always get to my table last! If possible, I would recommend requesting a table on the FIRST floor, by the buffet. I had to request for grilled pineapples 3 times, and the grilled pineapples came a total of 3 times. It this point, even though I wanted more, I felt annoying for requesting more. The servers came around so infrequently. At a time, there will be 1-3 servers serving food on the second floor, but never more than 3, which is really little for the number of tables there are. By the end of the dining experience, even though I was full, I did not feel like I got to eat enough steak for an all you can eat steak restaurant. 

The meats were also very salty, which they probably do on purpose. In comparison with the other 2 copacabanas, probably saltiest at this location."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 4 stars because the meat was beyond outstanding, but I couldn't.. It had a a bunch of downfalls that I couldn't overlook..

Pros:
They give small portions which is great because you pace yourself.. The carvers come around often and for the most part really friendly.. If you don't like medium rare meat, you gotta wait for them to cook it to your liking.. Lucky for me, I love my meat medium rare.. I loved the bacon wrapped filet, garlic steak and Brazilian beef.. Some of the sides were great... Notably the lasagna (has a nice kick to it), Mac and cheese (done with tons of cheese), selection of cheeses and fresh out of the oven bread.. And these bread triangle things.. Not sure what it was, but if it didn't look greedy for me to take an entire plate full, I would.

Cons:
We were seated upstairs.. The sides were downstairs.. I had to walk up and down every time I wanted more sides.. I loved the Mac and cheese but it was COLD.. got the mussels and it was cold and questionable.. Servers don't come around regularly to pick up your empty plate, so if you wanted more side dishes, you had to stack your plate.. A carver walked around with lamb and I wanted to try it, but he never came to my section... Saw another guy with shrimp and same thing.. Then I heard you had to special order it.. No one told me that.. Also, no one told me I had to pay for the water.. Also, there wasn't really entertainment..  I was told there's a bunch of dancers and guys doing flips.. We got 2 girls dancing kinda near us.. When the server finally offered to take our plates and give us fresh side plates, she never came back to us.. Lucky for her, we were full.. I was expecting a lot more, because I've heard how great this place was.. But I guess it's only the yonge and eg location that's really good"}
{"text":"Went to copa cabana a few times, love the fact that you can enjoy dinner and live shows however it's the same dance moves becomes nothing special after a few times. Food is good except servers were more focused on serving just the center tables. I asked many of the servers that night to have the shrimp. But as it came out the kitchen it all went to the center tables never made it farther. I was not satisfied the last time I was there with their service."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!  I was there with friends this past weekend and the service was absolutely atrocious.  Out of approximately 16 different meats only 5 were brought to our table over the course of 2 hours while tables around us were being served.  Drinks took over a half hour to arrive to our table when ordered and when we complained the waitress actually ROLLED HER EYES.  We called the manager over and he proceeded to write our complaints ON THE PALM OF HIS HAND!  When we were pointing out all the meats that have not been to our table and we mentioned the pork sausage the male waiter sarcastically said to us \"there is no sausage\" and turned his back.  To which one of the men in our party said \"it's right here on the list\".  The waiter then turned around and proceeded to charge towards our friend.  The manager stepped in and told him to leave and serve another table.  Finally the manager had the rest of the meats, but not all, come to our table pretty much all at once but we had already been there over 2 hours and it was past 10 at night.  Many of us did not eat.  To add insult to the horrible service we received they tacked on an automatic tip on each of the 5 couples bills.  Are you kidding me?  Our bill was over $170 dollars for 5 skinny slices of meat and some saladsfrom the salad bar, 4 beers and some sangria.  We will NEVER be back.  That was the worst experience at a restaurant we have ever had.  

ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS!"}
{"text":"We had reservations for 9pm. Arrived on time and wasn't seated until 45 min later. Only after asking to speak to a manager . People who came after us and had reservations were seated before us , this place is extremely unorganized.  Although our waiter was great,  due to the long wait by the time we were seated they were out of shrimp .... wasn't pleased with service for a Saturday night . The Niagara Falls location is much better."}
{"text":"We had a party of three, wanted to take my brother in law out for his birthday and we decided, why not feel like we are at home and try Copacabana and see if it can live up to the Brazilian expectations.

Service:
I made reservations for 7:00pm on a Sunday (thank goodness), we were seated right away , nice table on the second floor near the bar.

There are good waitresses and there are bad waitresses. There is one girl who kept asking if we wanted a new plate when our plates were empty but the plates are downstairs with the sides? I guess some people only go there for meat? WHAT? No beans or rice? So we were a little confused and getting annoyed with her but she was kind and gentle so we did not see any harm. 

Our main waitress was good for the most part- no complaints from her, when it got busy though it took a while for refills but still she was nice, interactive and attentive.

We got to try all the selections of meat (from chicken to sausage to the famous picanha).

One of the meat servers was a total jerk and extremely annoying. He was one of the many that came by and he would mumble the meat type so fast we had to ask him to repeat it and then he would get mad. At one point he turned over our circle from \"SIM- which means yes bring on the meat\" to \"NAO\" and I said, we want meat just not yours. Ass. But the other ones were professional, kind and we even had one of the guys tell us it was going to get busy so let him know which meats we preferred so he can come by again.

Atmosphere:
Great atmosphere! We had a taste of the live show, it was nice but not authentic Brazilian samba music which was disappointing, almost sounded like dub step at one point lol. 
The restaurant is gorgeous, modern and spacious. Everything from the light fixtures to the lighting and layout was well thought out.

Food:
Exceptional, especially the picanha. It literally was so tender and juicy and perfectly salted. The sides are great as well and have a wide variety of salads, pastas and the good ol' beans, white rice and the traditional fixings. We also enjoyed the filet Mignon with cheese (drool)

I'll certainly go back :)"}
{"text":"Very late review  but finally here. I have been here with my friends three times.  Twice at  the Adelaide location for regular price, and once at Eglinton for  a Winterlicious.
The  dining concept is  very simple and enjoyable, and makes for great conversations.  The staff are friendly ,willing to answer  questions about our food , bringing meats we ask for promptly, and giving us a great Copacabana Experience 
What disappoints  me is the dim lighting which makes it difficult to take pictures and videos of the food. We have to resort to flash photography which is annoying to others in the group as well as other patrons in the restaurant. 
Please increase the brightness level  at all the Copacabana locations so that we can capture  memorable moments  without disrupting others dining experience.  
Please add WiFi if possible. It will make it easier for us customers to upload the memorable memories at Copacabana  onto our social media accounts."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I have no idea why I agreed to come here for a friend's birthday, but I did!

Anyways, the place is physically really beautiful, and the decor is wonderful. Unfortunately the servers were a little standoffish and it took us around 10-20 minutes just to get their attention - I ordered a drink, and  it didn't come for half an hour! The food at the buffet was good, but nothing to write home about. I might add an additional star if I ate meat, but honestly with that service I'm not really sure."}
{"text":"I rarely ever do a one star. Perhaps i can even count how many times i have. The quality of the food is okay AT BEST. Everything is SUPER salty (as salt makes u not wanna eat more, very cheap trick). The antipasto bar is pretty limited in size. Then there is the serving experience. For $45 per person, on a Thursday night (not busy at all perhaps 4 small tables upstairs with us) at 10pm, it makes no sense not to get any service. 
So we all came in at 8pm, had food and my friend joined us at 10pm abouts the time we were all finished. So fair enough, since the e were a big table they had no idea and thought were all finished eating. So we tell 2 of the servers and no luck... We go for some salads for her hoping by the time we get back food will come around, still nothing... Long story short, at 10:55 after telling 5 servers and the manager(at 10:30) when i just had enough and got upset, more started coming in for her, at which time she was full. 

The attitude of servers were mostly terrible. Very rude and negligent. Surprisingly even when the manager told them to serve us food, nobody listened. whatever you do, DON'T go in groups!!! 

Servers weren't happy and they'd bring out 5-6 different meat before steaks come out. So approximately every 20 minutes a steak item comes and people would fight over them so nit even the entire party could eat them as itd finish and they'd go to \"get another skewer\" as they'd go mia for a good 20-30 minutes .

I haven't been there on a small table so maybe different but i wouldnt even want to try it. For the 2 of us with  some 6 shots and a beer the night costed over  $200 yet i got the worst service that in comparison McDonald would for sute take the award home. 

And no disrespect to others but most of the good reviews are for people who like to do an ayce meat at a nice setting of this restaurant.. So naturally This place isnt about service but volume. SALTY volume.

The only  here is given for their deep fried nabashe  and grilled pineapple"}
{"text":"It is the fourth time I go to Copacabana on Adelaide St. It keeps getting worse and worse... not the food but the service. We got there and the first thing they tell us is \"you only have 2 hours to eat\"... I understand this, it is reasonable but honestly I'm probably not even going to take two hours... they should not be saying this in a restaurant where you will pay at least $80. Then we struggled to get served. The waiters with the meat skipped our table at least 5 times. We were waving at them and all they did was ignore us. It is a really bad experience when you see the food coming one table behind you and then they turn around or go to another table when yours is supposed to be the next one. I told one of the waiters that he was skipping us and we did not even receive apologies. This is SO DISORGANIZED...there are some meats that I only ate once while tables next to me were served at least three or four times with this meat. 


Also.... there should be TWO different prices depending on where you are sitting... I know this sounds weird but there is only a buffet on the first floor! I was sitting on the second floor and It is annoying to stand up, go downstairs, and bring your food upstairs every time you want something. Also if you are seated on the second floor  FORGET ABOUT THE SHOW. The show mainly happens on the first floor. we could hear people clapping downstairs while we were missing everything. Some people that wanted to see the show from upstairs had to stand up and go to the stairs to watch it... RIDICULOUS!! if we are all paying the same price we should all get the same experience. The second floor is a really bad idea... They should have the show upstairs and a buffet there too.

I don't know if I'm ever going back... I used to love it there... not anymore."}
{"text":"Fastest all you can eat dinner ever! We were done just under an hour and my party was so stuffed from having copious amounts of meat! They have a small buffet table with salad and hot food (mostly pasta and rice). The guys walk around with a meat selection on a stick. You can have as much or as little as you want. They were coming around literally every 1-2 mins. All the meat was delicious especially if you eat it hot right after they carve. The shrimp and pineapple (with cinnamon) was so sweet and tasty. Spicy chicken was juicy. Lamb was really good. Service was attentive, friendly and exceptional. Tip: You eat for free on your birthday if you're a party of 4 adults."}
{"text":"Food is good but servers take forever to serve.

Line ups are INSANE and prices are not on the value end."}
{"text":"It was a terrible experience! The concept of copacabana was the waiter will bring you all the meat you can eat! 

I waved down a server but he told me he had to serve another table first when he was right in front of me! That left a sour taste in my mouth. The manager came by and asked how was everything and I told him what happened and he just non chantley said \"you can get shrimp from another server\". There was no apology, like it happens every time! Then when we were about done, they rushed our bill and came by multiple times, asking are we done. After we paid the bill and was enjoying some water, the waitress came by \"the next table is waiting downstairs\" to further rush us. 

The salad bar was nice and the potato fries were amazing! 

I don't know if we will be back. It's our fourth time here this year and this experience ruined it for us."}
{"text":"We loved our meal.  We went with our 9 year old twins and I was worried about what they would eat tonight.  They loved the buffet selection and to my surprise they loved the meat.

My only complaint is that a few of the waiters with meat were skipping our table.  We had to reach out and ask them to come back as we had not tried that particular cut of meat.

Other than that the 4 of us loved the entire meal.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're looking for something different. We didn't go on a weekend but I heard the entertainment is great. We went for my moms birthday and she ate free! 

The food is amazing. Everything was so good. First you go up and get starters. Theres a wide variety of Salads and pastas to choose from. As you're eating those, servers come around with meat. All different kinds of meats. Which were all so good. If you really liked one you can ask them to keep bring you that one or ask for others. They slice the meat for you and you take as much as you want. 

As we were eating they came around with fried pieces of banana!! Those were to die for. Definitely look out for those when you go. Near the end they came around with fried pineapple, which was amazing too. 

Everything was so good. I really want to go back and check out the entertainment on the weekend."}
{"text":"The food was good. There will always be inconsistency with how the meat are cooked since the heat they use or the age of meat they use will cook differently. Also, how much seasoning they use. I did find this Location to be a little bit on the salty side but that's okay because I literally didn't eat a lot during the day. So bring on the sodium lol! My favourites are the pineapple, dry rubs, filet mignon wrapped with bacon etc. As for the side dishes, great choices. Portions is appropriate to price. 

The entertainment though was great! We had the samba ladies. However, please tone down the volume. I honestly felt like I was going to lose my hearing.

If you are driving to this location.. there is impark outdoor parking right across the street with limited space. There is also an indoor parking garage entrance right beside the outdoor parking lot. 

I'd return again."}
{"text":"Amazing place. If you wanna have a dinner with good friends, it is a nice place to have a great night. You must try a pineapple!"}
{"text":"Booked a party here for October 7th and everyone had a blast. 

Our reservation was for 7:30, a few of us arrived early and they let us sit at our table right away. None of this \"majority of your party needs to be here for you to start\" BS, which I appreciated because we were all hangry.

Our table setup was a little weird. It was 2 table booths close to each other but it felt like we were eating as 2 separate groups. Not much that could be done because of the floor layout but we managed.

 The meat cutters came around frequently enough and gave our table of 15 great service. Picanha, flank, Parmesan chicken, pineapple and cornbread were all table favourites. 

Majority of the group paid using the Tab app (which was acting buggy at first, not Copa's fault) which was great because it takes $20 off your bill if you used a referral code. Still need to pay tax and gratuity on your \"pre-Tab\" total but it's a great way to save.

Reason I'm deducting a star is the reservation process. I initially made it weeks before at the restaurant and then two days before my dinner they call to ask why I haven't signed the contract yet. I went back to my emails thinking that I missed something and NOPE! No contract was ever sent. There wasn't even any mention of it in my confirmation email.

They take a $10 deposit per head and if the day of your function there are any no show's person that's hosting is stuck with the $45 charge for every person that drops out. Since that person was me, I was very anxious about signing this contract but everyone in my group showed up so I had nothing to to worry about. 

Thanks for the great evening Copa. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Amazing - went for a friends bachelorette party and was blown away by the food stations, everything was so delicious! Warning though, it is very easy to fill up there so temper yourself. The meat selection was endless and again everything tasted so good. The service was impeccable, the show with the acrobatics was great. Just remember to go and relax this place is not fast food, take your time and enjoy the experience because that is exactly what this place does in a spectacular way .... Provides you with an experience"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! More beautiful decor than the Yonge & Eg location but the food is just as good. (But this location doesn't participate in Summer/Winterlicious, while Yonge & Eg does.)

The salad bar and cooked food buffet is wonderful but of course we all come here for the meat. They have so many different cuts and they are all succulent and juicy and flavourful and delicious. 

Came here for a work party last year and have been very bummed that my firm chose to go somewhere else this year. 

I also consider this a must-go for other meat-oriented individuals like myself!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and honestly it's a solid 3 for me. 

The service at this specific location is fantastic (in my experience) every single time. The waiters are attentive and very friendly and the gentlemen who bring the meat are generous and have brought me certain meats from the kitchen that I like more so than the others.

The salad bar is a bit lacking in my opinion (I'm picky tho) but there are some good options, but really, you come here for the meat and chicken so it doesn't really affect my experience that much 

For the price ($45 Mon-thurs) I think it's well worth it. If you come here hungry and ready to eat you WILL get your money's worth. 

My only complaint for this place would be that some of the meats are a tad bit on the salty side.. which is the norm usually with buffet style restaurants. 

I will return again.. just not often."}
{"text":"Steak! Steak! Steak alert!! 

I don't always eat steak, but when I do... Holy cow Copacabana is the place to visit! Very impressed by the service and variety of mouthwatering, juicy, tender, and flavorful all-you-can-eat steaks that are sliced and served onto your plate on request! We had special steak, parmesan steak, sirloin steak, tenderloin steak wrapped in bacon,  chimichurri steak, and even chicken and shrimp!! Best of all was the pineapple (sorry no pics were taken as they were eaten to quickly haha )

Frugal Foodie Tip: Try going between Sunday to Thursday as it's cheaper! 

Overall, I'd highly recommended trying the best steaks here!"}
{"text":"Very very good environment and service. One of the server even noticed that we were looking at another meat when he was serving us. He then confirmed with us about the intention and brought the other server to our desk. I liked the salads too, good presentation, good selections and good tastes (maybe because we went at 430pm when the salad bar was just set up). Meat quality were always good. One star off because that I am not a big eater and wish that they can offer less selections/ set menu at a lower price."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday during summer with a group of friends. I made the reservation 2 days in advance online (open table).
It was a busy night for them, we were lead to our table on the 2nd floor in the steak house (they have a seafood restaurant downstairs). 
Then we helped ourselves to the Buffet, it consists of Salads, different kinds of sauce, bread, Rice and Pasta. All were good.
You will have a small card which will have a blue/Red colors to indicate if you are ready for meat or not.
After we went back to our table the meat carvers started rounding on the tables with different types of meat (Flank, Sirloin, Lamb..), Chicken ( Mozzarella and Spicy Moroccan- which was amazing!) and Shrimp.
At the end we were offered A grilled Pineapple and Fried Banana, I loved the latter.
At 19:10 the dancers came and performed a lovely dance with really loud music which I did not mind as it created a lively atmosphere. Then an acrobat performed a show with robes hanging toward the first floor surrounded by the dancers. 
It was an amazing night. I would definitely go back there and most importantly... I recommend it. 
Enjoy."}
{"text":"Went for my anniversary it was our first visit....was amazing, clean, atmosphere was good, was busy on a Saturday night. The meat just kept coming, the servers were all nice and friendly. Reasonable price all you eat. A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"I love to try out new places to dine out, so i decided to come here!! And to be honest with you i had the most amazing dinning experience ever !! The food was top notch its a buffet so its all you can eat, just imagine yourself in a really high end place with high end food and its all you can eat!! I was blown away by the quality of food and also, ambiance its was super cozy !! Probably one of my favourite spots from now on !! The only bad part about this place is the price point !! Super pricey, but hey you get for what you pay !!"}
{"text":"I was not prepared for this deliciousness.  Reviews had me a bit concerned, but gave this place a try on a business trip and wasn't disappointed.

Salad bar starts things off with a variety of cheeses, meats, breads and salads.  Definitely a good start although I merely tasted a bunch of the variety in preparation for the meat feast to come.

I was concerned the guys carrying the meat skewers would be few and far between but boy was I wrong!  There were tons of people stopping by, dropping a variety of steak, chicken, salmon and shrimp.  It was all amazing!  Some cuts were flavored with parmesean, chimichurri, melted cheese or just a bit of salt and pepper. I was blown away.  They were delicious.  And gave you a great sample of flavors.

Service was also great.  My water was constantly filled, and one guy in particular made sure that if I had any \"special requests\" that he checked on the status (I did ask for shrimp and it was promptly brought to my table).  Yes, it is a bit overwhelming because you get bombarded with options but I would much rather have that than the opposite.

The meal is finished off with a couple slices of spiced pinneapple which was amazing.

All in all, a great experience that rivals what I actually had in Sao Paulo."}
{"text":"5- stars all the way
From service to food

Excellent selection of steaks. 
Great ambience 
Amazing experience 

A must go."}
{"text":"Calling all meat lovers! Great food & great entertainment. Im glad i made a salad bowl before all the servers came to our tables with cut meat - i needed the greens/sides with the amount of meat i had. It was a friday night and there were dancers entertaining the lounge while we were all eating with upbeat music. Near the end of my dinner my plate was piling with meat that i had to start saying no! Beware: you WILL get a food belly when youre done!!!"}
{"text":"Nightmare of an effort at being a Brazilian steakhouse.

Service is horribly, slow and no effort to transition you from the bar to the table.

Not good value for money unless you are prepared to wait three hours so you can eventually have your fill of meats.

Flavors and texture of beef is merely so so.

Give this place a miss."}
{"text":"There are many Brazilian bbq restaurants in California and I've been to quite a few of them, and for one to sprout up in the northeast in Canada must be exciting for its residents.  From what I saw, many Canadians have not yet experienced this type of dining.  I don't know if there are many around Canada, but I must say the quality of meats here was quite impressive and the restaurant itself was trendy and on the casual classy end.  The service was great and the servers kept the meat coming.  We had such a great time that our dinner lasted til the close of the restaurant.  Don't forget to have the sugary grilled pineapple at the end.  It's one thing I have not had at another Brazillian bbq which I wish hopefully will spread to the west.

Note: Brazillian cheeseballs need to be on the menu. Not a want but a need."}
