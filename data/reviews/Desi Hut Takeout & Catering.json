{"text":"Great little spot! finally a place with good biryani at affordable prices and the lassi is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Small, quaint place you could easily drive past without noticing. Prices are reasonable. Ordered the chicken biryani for $4.99. Haven't tried it, but it smells right. It has what seems to be a decent amount of chicken, although more would always be preferable. Also ordered the butter chicken for $5.99. The butter chicken came with a fresh naan and a small box of what the lady at the counter said was salad, but seems more like yogurt sauce. The butter chicken is incredibly oily (as in pool of oil atop the dish) and it's not particularly red, but the sauce is quite tasty and the chicken is quite tender. I would have liked more chicken for that price, but it's not a bad deal. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this business opened! I haven't had indian food this tasty in a long time. Im not generally a fan of butter chicken, but this one was so tasty and creamy!! Yum.  Nice soft tasty and colourful garlic naan. Yummmmm! The tikka chicken and tandoori was also very tasty!!  OMG and the prices are the cheapest ever for the combos.   Some Indian/Pakistani restaurants look cheap, rundown n dirty and kinda smell, but this place was neat and clean and painted nicely with nice furniture.   Most of all, the owner and staff was very nice.  I totally recommend this place!!! I will defo be returning!!!"}
