{"text":"Oh boy this place was gorgeous and classy, such a perfect marriage of a bar, lounge, and club all rolled up in one!

There was no cover for us two girls on a Saturday night and there was a very short line to get in, we waited less than five minutes.

There are two levels. Downstairs has a bar and lounge area. Upstairs has two bars, a lounge area, a DJ, and an area to dance. 

I loved how much space there was here! It was also decorated very beautifully. There were firepits too. Great for a girls night out or a date!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times to the W Pool/Shade Lounge for nighttime events (various Halloween parties, Super Bowl Playboy Party, a few private after parties that were being hosted there) and also day pool lounging with friends. I'll start off by saying any of the nighttime events I've attended have been top notch! How they put everything together with the tiniest of details is awesome! The service from bartenders has also been quick and friendly which is hard to find at times especially when there is a big event going on. I always look forward to the next nighttime party at the W because I know it will be great service and a fun time.

Now, on to the day/pool party/lounging. I've gone several times with a group of friends to hang out and get some sun at the pool during the day. Again, the service is awesome. One particular visit we had not reserved a daybed so the pool attendant quickly got us chairs to sit around the pool. He was soooo extremely nice and helpful. The bartenders again during the day were attentive and remembered our drinks every time! We ordered some food on one visit to the pool and it was some of the better foods at a pool in town! 

I will be back actually this weekend for an event hosted again there Friday and Sat night and cannot wait because I know it will be a great time with great service!!"}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown Scottsdale.  I personally despise sports bars and I feel that the majority of places around this area are just that.  Bars with tvs and waaaaay too loud of music.
The W is an upscale Vegas type hotel (but MUCH smaller) and it provides a more elegant spot to mix and mingle.  The first time I came to Shade the place was pretty quiet (10 pm on a Fri...but no event) which was fine by me because there was room to sit and chill (per my previous review of the W) and dance to the dj.  We went again recently and they happened to be having a large event.  Loved the vibe again, but too crowded for my taste.  Nowhere to sit or even to dance.  Literally all you could do was just stand there with a drink in hand and stare at your companions which is not my idea of a good time.  Music was still poppin and I would've enjoyed dancing but there wasn't anywhere to do so.  So we moved downstairs to the area where they have a live band.  Still crowded but by about 10:30 it was starting to clear out a little and we managed to find a spot. 
First, we ordered drinks at the bar (downstairs).  They managed to mix up our drinks and charged them all on 1 credit card instead of the 2 we handed them.  Honestly, this type of stuff really bugs me.  The bartenders have ONE job.  And as mentioned, it wasn't nearly as busy as upstairs.  But we were well taken care of once we were seated.  Interesting to note that the same drink that cost $10 ordered at the bar was $13 at our table.  Not sure why.
Music was again, really great-both the live band and the dj that followed...but again, there wasn't a dance floor.  I like to kick back and relax, chill but I like to dance too.  All in all this is a good spot for people watching more than anything!!!!  You seriously feel like you're in Vegas."}
