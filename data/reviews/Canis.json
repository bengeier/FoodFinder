{"text":"Actually, 4.5 stars.

Wow - this meal totally made up for my abysmal birthday meal in San Diego (see George's California Modern review).  

This is a fairly new restaurant that I've been wanting to try.  I used to go to One of a Kind Pasta which finally closed, and was interested in seeing how Canis would convert the space.  You wouldn't even know you're in the same location!

I keep seeing photos of the roast duck (for 2) whenever this restaurant is mentioned in reviews. Being a lover of duck, imagine my disappointment when they told me that they had just changed over to their spring menu and there's no more duck.  Oh well, this just gives me another reason to visit again.

There were 3 of us and we ordered oysters, the duck pate (yay, I got some duck!), their \"falafel\", and also enjoyed their bread basket.

For my 4-course meal, I had the albacore tuna, the celeriac, the short rib, and the chocolate/buckwheat.  Everything was beautifully presented - my friend was snapping away at photos, and the flavours and textures a delight to the mouth (this sounds so corny I know, but it's the truth!)  I had originally chosen the squid as my 2nd course, but mentioned a slight sensitivity to nuts when ordering dessert and the server actually came back to explain that the romanesco has nuts, and suggested the celeriac instead.  I normally would not intuitively order root vegetable - but this dish was delicious!  

We all enjoyed the meal - it was paced well, and service was excellent.

So why 4.5 stars, instead of 5?  The wine list had limited new world offerings by the glass, which is our preference.  However, the sommelier asked us our preferences, and suggested a bottle of wine that not yet on the list.  It was a perfect suggestion.  And for one friend who wanted white (our bottle order was for a red), they brought her a tasting to ensure she would be happy with the choice.

For the presentation and the quality of the food, this restaurant is a super good deal.  This is probably the best meal I've had in 2017 so far!"}
{"text":"Contemporary, fine, seasonal cuisine in an intimate and casual setting. Service was attentive without being pretentious. Food was sophisticated and inventive without being contrived. One of the most delicious meals we've eaten in Toronto. Four course prix fixe, or 7 course tasting menu, so limited choices. Not recommended for strict vegetarians but as fish eaters (but no meat) we were able to enjoy a celebratory anniversary dinner. Definitely will go back in another season."}
{"text":"This restaurant won't be under the radar for much longer. It's a joy to eat somewhere that is run with this much love and hard work, yet they make it seem effortless. The food is so creative, unexpected, and comforting. Service has been perfect both times I have been. Love the small room, feels intimate but not too fancy. What a gem."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant on a recent visit to Toronto. 

Small, sleek, modern interior in light wood feels Scandinavian. 

Interesting wine selection and very creative 4 course tasting menu. Everything we ordered was interesting, beautifully presented and expertly prepared. Portions are modest, perfect for the multi-course format. Service friendly and well timed. 

Amazing bread service, don't skip it: goat milk butter and ricotta+chimichurri. 

Favorites dishes: beef tartare, squid in ink, lamb. But all were great. 

And a very good value for the creativity and effort needed to prepare. 

Outside the main tourist area so you'll feel like a local in-the-know. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Unbelievable meal. We had the four course meal and it was great. The scallops were great but both item on the second courses: squid and duck confit, were off the charts good.  Excellent service to top it off."}
{"text":"What a delightful experience! Every dish was such a mystery and when they arrived I was always pleasantly surprised. I can't wait to go back. The beet salad was like nothing I've ever had before. I also adored the concept of a pâté tart as it was a not only visually appealing but an efficient delivery method! Buckwheat as the star of a dessert did not leave me disappointed. 

It is obvious that the people behind Canis put tremendous thought and effort into creating a wonderful experience from start to finish. I will be back and I urge you to visit!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was the rave reviews that kind of ruined it for me, but Canis proved to be just a bit above average experience in part due to my high expectations. I came here to celebrate a birthday dinner on a Thursday at 6PM. At first glance, I was surprised to find the place very dark and empty even though we informed the server and arrived 20 minutes late. Decor was definitely minimalistic and not too pretentious, which can be a plus for some people. I would say the pasta and the desserts were definitely something special. But I found the oysters, cured meat, and the duck to be decent, but nothing worth the significant amount of praise that I've read prior to my visit. Overall, I would go back for some desserts and wine (great value), but it may take some time to try an all-out dinner for $200 (for 2ppl)."}
{"text":"Great gem in Toronto. Menu is fixed but well thought out and executed. Staff are attentive and enthusiasts about the food they deliver. Love the vibe in this place as its very laid back and welcoming. Chef Kang is heading straight for victory with this establishment! Keep it up and don't change a thing."}
{"text":"Truly beautiful experience. Wonderful service, spectacular food, such a genuinely warm and enjoyable evening that I didn't want it to end. Pretty much the perfect place."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, service and quite liked the music they played. 
Decor is very minimalist, which I also enjoyed.
The main dishes: squid and duck were both flavorful and delicious. The duck was especially unforgettable: tender, juicy, nicely seasoned and the skin was perfectly crispy.
But the appetizers (beef tartar) and desserts were just okay ones.
Sourdough and chimichurri were delicious.
Coffee canele was the final touch, but I personally don't think it's a good idea to incorporate coffee flavor into canele.
Will definitely return for the fabulous duck dish"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Canis for a while now and my birthday seemed like a decent enough occasion. The food is touted as Local Canadiana and they delivered a well thought out tasting menu that was delicious from beginning to end. 
We sat by the kitchen and it was interesting to see the bustle of everyone working, but it was very hot. I might not recommend sitting here if you are a Sweaty Betty like me.
All the courses were wonderful. I I even enjoyed the bread that they served with chive butter and mascarpone with ramp confit.
The wine pairing was the only element of the dinner that I found underwhelming. Normally, I expect a wine for each course. Some of them were meant for two courses and I would have finished the pour with once course in anticipation of the next.
The other issue was  the 'pour'. Wine was pre-poured and presented at the table with the bottle. I feel like with a menu this nice and service of this level that the wine ought to be poured AT the table. After all, the presentation is part of regular wine service.
Grilled veal was succulent. Chocolate and sunflower was unexpected and wonderful. Could have eaten a dozen of the razor clams."}
{"text":"Best beef tartare ive ever had
Chocolate dessert is amazing
The duck was a little too rare for me"}
{"text":"As a single, got relegated to the bar, which just happens to overlook the kitchen. More like watching a ballet than five guys cooking up a storm. Incredible energy and the person who puts the dish together is the one who serves it, at least at the bar. They care, and you can tell it from the taste and presentation. Had the prix fixe menu and a couple of glasses of wine, $125 with tip, and a bargain at the price. Each plate looks tiny, but four courses add up to a full meal without feeling stuffed. Ready to spring for the tasting menu next time."}
{"text":"Canis is an amazing restaurant.

Chefs Jeff and Tosh bring years of experience to this restaurant.

One of the greatest meals that I've enjoyed in Toronto"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the modern industrial feel of the resturant. The staff was very pleasant and knowledgeable. My husband and I started with the fresh goat cheese, beet, almond salad, and the beef tartare. It was my first time trying the beef tartare and very pleased with the result. For our main, we ordered the duck for two and the aged pork loins; both very good. We are definitely going back again."}
{"text":"I liked the simplistic style and look of the restaurant. 

One of our friends was running late.  The server curtly informed us that there was a two-hour sitting policy and that we would have to give our table back by 8 p.m.

When A arrived and heard about this, she asked about the sitting time policy as it wasn't noted on their restaurant at all.  Another server informed us that since there was another party booked at our table for 8:10 pm, we just had to make sure that we vacated our table five minutes before their arrival.  

We ordered the seven-course tasting menu.  For every course that we had that night, there were at least 2 servers who delivered the food to our table simultaneously.  You can expect professional and tailored service here.

The first item at our table was the bread course which were three slices of sourdough bread set on a deep set plate for each of us and an in-house made salted chive butter and ricotta cheese with garlic to share.  This was incredibly delicate and I loved the wooden serving handles for the butter and cheese.

Our first course was a \"tuna, blonde cucumber, green tomato\".  This was a salad deep set in a bowl with tuna, salmon roe, and carefully sliced cucumbers and halved fresh green tomatoes.  It was an artistic presentation for sure.  The tuna was hidden underneath the greens.  This was a really fresh dish and I was pleased that there were more chunks of tuna fish within the bowl than I had anticipated.  The flavours were fresh and definitely not strong at all.

The second course was a \"beef tartare, sorrel, yogurt\". At first look, this dish is just a plain clump of grass.  I've never eaten beef tartare in this fashion before with sorrel greens and I found that the texture was very different from just eating the chewy and soft raw beef tartare in previous meals. 

The third course was \"squid, pea, parcel\".  This was a much bigger portion than I expected.  Again, the dish was served in a deep dish where the ingredients were presented in the most beautiful way with edible flowers and even some chopped scallop bits (that weren't detectable at all but definitely there).  The squid was prepared in ribbons and it made it look like we had noodles at first.  I was also impressed with how much squid there was inside this dish!  

The squid was firm and soft; not chewy at all.  The best part about this dish was the hearty broth that was present at the bottom of the dish.  We took no shame; we all slurped and finished up this delicious broth before the bowls were taken away from us.

The fourth course was a fish dish of \"halibut, lovage, scallop\".  I was incredibly impressed with the taste of this dish.  The halibut was cooked so that it maintained extreme moistness and firmness with the green sauce bursting into each bite. The greens on top, as R mentioned, were indeed a bit bitter and perhaps the only downfall of this dish.  Everything else was delicious!

The fifth course was \"beef short rib, broccoli, zucchini\".  First, a large platter of the beef short ribs was placed on our table. Meanwhile, we were served the broccoli and zucchini on individual dishes.  I absolutely loved the way that the charred zucchini acted as a \"boat\" for the broccoli florets to rest upon.  Also, I loved how the stalks of the broccoli were sliced up and cut into squares.  

This was a delicious beef short rib course! The broccoli zucchini boat was good too but nothing outstanding in terms of taste other than earning dozens of points for its unique presentation.  Health-wise, I didn't like that the zucchini was charred completely over.

The first dessert was like a palate-cleanser.  This was a \"raspberry, buttermilk\".  It was called \"buttermilk snow\" by the server and there were edible flowers on this as well. 

To put it plainly, this actually tasted like I was eating soft snow.  It was another highly unique dish!  The raspberries had nothing special to them so the main draw of this dessert was definitely the buttermilk snow.  

Our final course of the night was the \"koji, almond, white chocolate\".  This was a classic case of \"saving the best for last\"!!  In short, I loved this dish!  I really like chocolate anything and the white chocolate ice cream in this was spectacular!  The texture and flavour of the white chocolate ice cream was rich, creamy, and perfect.  It tasted so good.  I also really enjoyed the rich almond pieces that acted as art pieces to the dessert too.  Such a perfect dessert! 

To our surprise, we were served a final finisher for the night.  These were coffee canelés, \"a small French pastry flavoured with rum and vanilla with a soft and tender custard centre and a dark, thick caramelized crust.\" They were really crispy and semi hard on the outside while its interior was soft and custardy.

I think it's the perfect place for a foodie willing to splurge on an incredible meal for the eyes and for the stomach.  The tasting menu cost $85 for seven courses."}
{"text":"According to EnRoute Magazine, Canis is one of Canada's best new restaurants of 2017. In fact, it is number 2 on the top ten list. I knew I had to try Canis when I saw that it was listed as one of Canada's best. It did not disappoint. 

The decor was sleek and modern. The restaurant was small and had a very intimate feel to it. The open kitchen made the space feel spacious. (It was fun watching the chef working behind the kitchen.) The service was friendly and attentive.

The food was amazing. I did the $85 tasting menu. There were 8 courses (not including the bread). Using seasonal ingredients, Chef Jeff Kang was able put together dishes with unique flavours and textures. The dishes were innovative and creative. Some of the standout included the albacore tuna with artichoke, pork with brussels sprout and Chef Jeff Kang's signature duck.  

Canis is definitely one of the best restaurants in Toronto. The price of the tasting menu is fair as the dishes are high quality and masterful prepared."}
{"text":"Super awesome yummy! Why not a five star you ask?  Great food- innovative, non pretentious and friendly service but i was freezing and I am pretty regulated when it comes to temperature!  The restaurant was really cold and the atmosphere was not beautiful. I hate wood paneling so I have a bias here. That said, I would return for the gracious service and very yummy menu. Please pretty up the space though!"}
{"text":"First time here on a Saturday night. I normally don't write reviews, but I had to for this place. 
Amazing decor, very minimalist. Atmosphere is great, staff is lovely and attentive.
Food was amazing, hands down. 10/10 would go back and recommend to all!! Go to this place!!"}
{"text":"Great date night Restaurant. Flavorful food presented in lovely dishes showing off good technique. It's always a good sign when you really enjoyed the bread they bring you. They bought it with butter and ricotta with chimichurri. Beef tartare was good and I loved it's garnish equally, they put a lot of effort into their dishes and it shows . Mushroom pasta dish in broth was smooth and sexy! Duck for two was presented beautifully and then taken away to be sliced and was very generous portion. All in all very thoughtfully presented and conceived food that was well executed. My only slight issue was perhaps the pacing of the meal, it actually went a little faster than I would have liked since we are fast eaters! I will try to slow down next time!"}
{"text":"Took my husband to the Canis restaurant for his birthday. I keep seeing pictures of their famous duck dish all over the place so was a little disappointed when they said it's no longer on the menu. However I did get the duck confit which was delicious, more on that later. 

It looks like Canis changes its menu quite frequently to keep things interesting, and I applaud them for the effort. Most things on the menu was good, and a four course meal of this quality for $65 is definitely a steal. My favourite was the duck confit (the chef definitely knows how to do duck), the meat was tender and the skin super crispy. I also liked my buttermilk rhubarb and hazelnut dessert, it was very light airy, visually pleasing and full of flavour. My husband liked his squid in ink dish, and the foie gras tart. 

The reason why I deducted one star is because the lamb loin dish was quite the disappointment... It was way too chewy, and difficult to cut... Not sure what went wrong there... Hopefully it's just an off night because otherwise that dish shouldn't be on the menu. Also they could probably expand their drinks menus to include some cocktails or nonalcoholic drinks. The drinks menu was mostly wine. 

All in all, great little bistro serving Canadiana style food with potential to be even better. Good service too."}
{"text":"Canis is a real gem. My boyfriend and I came in after seeing the review on BlogTO and the food and service totally exceeded our expectations. 

The presentation was beautiful, we usually aren't food photographers but we couldn't resist snapping photos of the dishes. They tasted even better than they looked! We had the falafel, trout and lamb dishes. All were unique and delicious.  

One of my new fav spots in Toronto for sure."}
{"text":"Easily the best dining experience of 2017. Each bite of the 7-course tasting menu was thoughtful, creative and delicious. Service was incredibly attentive, relaxed and genuine. My partner and I are complete wine-newbies, and our server recommended an amazing Italian red that complimented our dinner. 

From the stupidly tasty food, to the '90s hip-hop soundtrack, to the personal level of service from Chef Kang and his team, our night was definitely one to remember."}
{"text":"Came to Canis to try the dinner tasting menu. They have an 8-course option for $88 and a 6-course option for $68. We opted for the 8-course to get the full experience. 

As soon as we ordered, out came some fresh sourdough bread with two different kinds of spread. One was a garlic butter with chives and the other was a ricotta cheese spread with chimichurri toppings. The bread was nice and warm and the outside crisp, which was delicious to eat with the spreads.

They have only a small selection of beers, but the burdock American pale ale I got was awesome. A little fruity, very smooth, and went extremely well with the entire meal.

COURSE 1 (oyster, uni, parfait). The PEI Savage Blonde oysters were small but had a nice firm meat and tasty. The uni came served directly in the half-shell served on ice, very fresh, smooth, and delicious. The parfait consisted of duck pate with grape jelly with a hazelnut topping served inside a crispy tart crust. The sweetness of the grape jelly melded perfectly with the bold taste of the duck pate, and the crunch from both the hazelnut and the tart crust added some extra texture. This was absolutely delicious, I could eat an entire plate of this! 

COURSE 2 (salmon, turnip, buttermilk). This was smoked-salmon served on top of a bed of turnip salad with a nice refreshing buttermilk sauce.

COURSE 3 (tuna, maitake, snail). The maitake was so aromatic and cooked perfectly to retain a slight crunch. The sashimi-grade tuna was just lightly seared so the inside is still raw and delicate. The snails were tiny but still very flavorful, tasty, and not chewy like some of the bigger escargots. The flavors of the three components really complimented each other and were absolutely delicious!

COURSE 4 (mussels, potato, dill). The fresh dill and light cream sauce really went well with the plump juicy mussels. When you have mussels this fresh, it's so nice to have such a light delicate sauce that still allows you to taste the sweetness of the meat.

COURSE 5 (cabbage, bone marrow broth). This was one dish I thought could have been executed slightly better. The bone marrow broth tasted like the most wonderful tonkatsu ramen soup that was condensed down until it was extra creamy and rich. The cabbage itself wasn't very special and since it was slightly burnt added a little bitterness to the taste. With such a wonderful broth, the cabbage just didn't do it justice. A few pieces of pork loin instead would have blown this dish out of the park.

COURSE 6 (duck, confit, parsnip). The duck confit was an entire half a duck, which is a very generous portion for 2 people. The breast portion was so succulent and tender, and even the bone portion still had plenty of meat. The sauce reduction on the side gave the duck even more flavor. It was rather unfortunate that my steak knife was duller than a butter knife. It was very hard to get the meat off the bone with that knife and I didn't want to let any go to waste! 

COURSE 7 (pear, almond, buttermilk). The pear sorbet with shaved ice was a little sour but was an excellent palette cleanser after the rich duck entree.

COURSE 8 (milk, blondie, white chocolate). This was one dessert that I wasn't very fond of. The salted caramel sauce on top of the ice cream was too salty for me. The blondie was good, but nothing special. Two cold desserts might be good on a hot summer day, but not great when it's minus 10 outside in the middle of winter. Would have been awesome to get at least one hot dessert like a molten lava cake instead.

Overall, this was one fantastic tasting menu. There were a couple of dishes that could have been better executed, but the vast majority of the dishes were amazing. Unlike some tasting menus at other restaurants, each of the dishes had a very generous portion size. The single duck dish itself was significantly bigger than most full duck confit entrees at other restaurants. So all of this for just $88 was a real bargain! I would have to say this is one of my top-ten tasting menu restaurants. Will definitely be back again when they rotate out the selection on the tasting menu."}
{"text":"I am in my 60s and the eight-course dinner we just had at Canis was genuinely the singular greatest meal of my life, bar none. When we first got there I thought it was a bit unusual that there were only two choices on the entire menu - a larger prix fixe tasting menu and a smaller one. Originally wondered about a restaurant functioning with such a limited menu. But that is the genius of it. For the chefs to just concentrate on the same complicated order rather than scatter their efforts and energies preparing dozens of individual a la carte orders, they get things down to a science and achieve near perfection. Every course had so many delicate subtle nuances with distinctive flavors and textures that there was a complexity to it. I got the feeling that this was a real labor of love. We sat at the chef's table overlooking the kitchen and it was a revelation watching this exceptionally happy looking staff practice their mystical art. Service was remarkably attentive and every course brought to us was given a fascinating description by the very diligent servers. This restaurant is a towering achievement."}
{"text":"Great food, attentive service. They only do tasting menus (4 or 6 course), which I wasn't aware of before we went. The two of us went for the 4-course and neither of us were still hungry by the end of the meal. The only suggestion I have for the staff is to put a door on the stairs to the basement, because the wet basement smell wafting up from downstairs was unpleasant and quite noticeable in the restaurant."}
{"text":"No one I know gushes about this place. Totally shocking why they wouldn't but also this leads me to believe it's probably one of the more underrated prix fixe Toronto restaurants. Menu is thoughtful; simple ingredients with top-notch execution; service is attentive. I'd return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Very interesting restaurant the menu is fixed and its a four course meal $65 there is 3 choices for each course.  I like the presentation and plating very unique.  The portions are small but sufficient.  The service was good and decor clean a modern.  Raw scallop was very light and refreshing, duck confit was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and mushrooms comp it well.  The beef was tender and juicy also very good and to finish off the pear with crispy things for dessert I also enjoyed.  So definitely recommend this place for a try."}
{"text":"Had to try Canada's top 2 new restaurant of 2017. 
Interesting little restaurant (seating around 25) with a lot of energy - feel a real buzz in the air. Open style kitchen- literally. Sitting at the bar I got an unobstructed view of everything - stove, fresh station, prep station that also acts as a dessert station too. 

Service: Friendly and not rushed. Contrasts how the kitchen and wait staff moving frenetically. 

Optional starter - A quad of freshly shucked PEI oysters. Order it!  So good in October - fat and plump with a dash of horseradish. 
0.5 course - Beef tartare topped with uni. Creamy uni worked so well with the beef. 
1st course - Venison tartare. Gherkins provided the vinegar enhancement - really enjoyed the crunch it brings. 
2nd course - Albacore tuna. Not my favorite dish. I mistook the fish for some form of processed cheese. The capers reminded me of gherkins again. Liked it in the 1st course but not in this one.  Perhaps I should tried the duck confit instead. 
3rd course - Beef short rib with stuffed Hungarian pepper. Tender beefy taste. Hint of salt provides a dash of sharpness. Sauce is not typical - Mild bone marrow taste. The stuffed Cayenne Pepper is wow! Stuffed with ground meat that has complex spices. I like!
Dessert- Frozen buttermilk like a Korean shaved milk ice with dried peaches, honeycomb buried underneath. Not too sweet, slightly yogurt flavor - a real adult taste. 

Along with a glass of wine, it was close to $100. Overall I really enjoyed the creativity and surprising flavors some of the dishes (0.5 and 4th). 

This may be one of my first 5 Star rating in Toronto. A must try!"}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely did not disappoint. 

Decor is super minimalist with Scandinavian touches. Even the plates were unique. 

Food was amazing and reminded me of some of my favourite nyc hot spots. Unique flavours and combinations truly makes this a top restaurant in Canada. 

Loved this place and will be back again!"}
{"text":"I came here for a special occasion treating one of my best friends for his birthday. We make a habit of trying new places all the time in the city and this was high on our list. The biggest issue that detracted from the experience was the smell. In the basement and near the kitchen it smelt like sewer and it was so strong that it completely distracted from the entire dining experience. To be honest I had very much lost my appetite. The bathrooms were in the basement and the stench literally made me nauseous - so beware. If you're going to eat here request a table close to the door or window and don't use the bathroom or it will really sour the meal. As far as the meal goes we did the 5 courses with the wine pairing. The wine pairing was excellent and the server gave both reasonable and accurate descriptions of what was served. The starter bread was delicious! Oysters were far too \"fishy\" tasting. Scallop dish was excellent and so unique! Tuna with snails and mushrooms less so. Somehow the tuna dish was really lack lustre for me - the buttery flavour of the fish mixed with the slippery texture of the mushrooms and the snails just didn't do it for me. 2 bites and I was done. The short rib was excellent and my favourite dish of the meal. Two desserts on a 5 course tasting feels a little too much - the first was a great palette cleanser but not as delicious as the final. The blondie was the highlight of the meal for me. Servers were lovely and overheard that we were there for a birthday so they brought us a special little treat at the end which was a nice surprise. Overall the price isn't worth it, the smell really ruined our appetite, but there were some dishes in there that were great. Would not go back nor recommend it for the price they charge but i almost feel guilty saying that because the servers were so lovely."}
{"text":"There are many standouts in the prix fixe, for example the duck, the lovely ink pasta... And the free bread as all have mentioned  ... There are a few fixes that could make the place top notch, though. The server who spoke a million miles an hour - slow down, what's your rush. The yucky bathrooms in the basement, not a nice sight. 
Overall, great little spot"}
{"text":"Service is genuinely warm and friendly, the food is good and fairly reasonably priced for Queen West. The bread is delicious, i'd return."}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars
Service - 2.5 stars
Ambiance - 3 stars

My husband and I tried the $88 eight course set dinner. Food was thoughtful and fun. I appreciate the texture and creativity the chef put into his food. Highlights were the duck and the almond crumbs + yogurt palate cleanser. The duck was well cooked with the fat nicely rendered leaving a nice crispy skin. 

Space is clean, simple and modern. However the room was cold, most ladies had their jackets on. The bench can be more comfortable. Since dinner took almost 2.5 hours, I would imagine cushions will elevate the experience. Also, the man beside me would shake his legs every so often and the vibration would transfer to me, which was  annoying. Again cushions probably could have prevented this. 

Most disappointing part of our dinner was the service. Not once did anyone check in on our experience. It was also hard to get the servers' attention. They all seemed to walk with a mission dashing back and forth. There was one stand out Server, a lady with the braids. She was cheerful and friendly who looked like she was having fun. When the dishes were dropped off, most of staff sounded like they were just reading words off a mental menu. Come on put some passion into it, romance the food!!! The chef worked so hard to create these intricate dishes, romance it! Appreciate it! Make the customer fall in love with it! 

I overheard a nearby table tell the Servers that it was his companion's birthday, there was no candle on the dessert and no warm wishes. Overall the food was enjoyable. Sadly it was not an experience we had hoped for, wasn't warm nor welcoming. It was also frustrating that no one returned my 2 voicemails the day prior and the day of my reservation. I read on other reviews that we should make sure the duck is available as it's not always on the menu. A courtesy call back would have been appreciated. I hope they work on delivering personalized service to create an \"experience\" for their diners. Th Chef himself can also show more enthusiasm when bringing dishes to the diners."}
{"text":"I came in September for the prix fixe menu. Four courses $65 + $13~ for a glass of Sauv Blanc. 

Complimentary house made sour dough + garlic chives butter + ricotta & pickles to start. Excellent. 

First Course: raw scallop, cucumber, beef garum (5/5)
Super fresh raw scallop in bite-sized chunks. Love the freshness and sweetness of the cucumber, cucumber juice and mint leaves. 

Second Course: humboldt squid, peas, cured pork (4/5)
First time having squid in long strips (sort of like flat rice noodle shape). Love the texture - it's slightly chewy yet soft. The beef and peas reminded me of Chinese flavours which I wasn't too fond of. 

duck confit, mushroom, comte - the duck was melt-in-your-mouth soft, topped with thinly sliced, fresh raw button mushrooms. 

Third Course: halibut, zucchini, dried scallop, dill (5/5)
Best halibut I've ever had. Cooked sous-vide, it was extremely tender and moist. Paired with fresh, sweet zucchini. Again, we can see that the freshness of ingredients is key to these dishes. 

Fourth Course: buttermilk, peach, honeycomb (4/5) 
Buttermilk snow was a cold surprise. I liked the fresh and dried peaches along with the caramelized sweetness of honeycomb.

koji, almond, white chocolate (4/5) 
Loved the almond crumbles paired with the icecream.

Complimentary canelle at the end. 

The décor is very simple and clean. I feel the whole concept is Scandinavian-inspired, from the food to the tableware.

Overall a good experience that lives up to the hype. I would be interested to try their famous duck."}
{"text":"My oh my. *heart eyes*

Modern atmosphere with rustic table settings and delicious food.

We ate:
- Complimentary bread with ricotta and chimmichuri dip + garlic butter (5/5): SO GOOD I'd pay for it.
- Beet Salad (4/5): Interesting textures and delicious almonds
- Pork Jowl & Brussels (5/5): So unique and delicious
- THE duck for two (5/5): This for me was the star. The duck was perfect, along with the sides, felt like someone made this just for me with lots of love.
- Wine selection by the glass (3/5): This is super personal, but I wish they had a wider selection of reds by the glass.

Atmosphere:
Went on a Wednesday at around 7:30pm and was semi-full. Good place to catch-up with friends over delicious and not-fussy food."}
{"text":"Excellent wine pairings and stand out desserts.  I do not have a sweet tooth so this is an unusual highlight for me.  The service was great until the last desert course.  There was no wine pairing which I felt was lacking for the price point and we felt very rushed.  Final dessert course, petit fours and bill were all presented in rapid succession.  Almost immediately after dropping off the bill a server appeared with the POS machine.  It was clear we had overstayed our welcome.  However at only 2 hours for a $400 bill this felt a bit tacky.  All in all great food and wine but not a place for a celebration if you want to 'make an evening' of it."}
{"text":"Went in to dine at Canis for an 8 course meal with wine pairing after being recommended about the place by a friend. My bf and I were lucky to be seated at the chef's rail so we were able to catch all the live action of our food and plates being prepared. The cooks, chef, as well as the sommelier were interactive with us in being very attentive, as well as sharing with us where their produce is sourced, and answering any questions we had about the dishes. Every dish was executed and presented beautifully, and the flavors did not dissapoint. 

The highlights of the meal were the two tarts we received at the beginning of the meal (A beef tartare, sunflower, and egg yolk tart as well as a liver pate tart) which were light but also very flavorful and had a beautiful crisp tart shell. We both also enjoied the lamb as it was cooked to perfection, being very delicious as it was tender. And can't forget about dessert; out of the 3 phenomonal desserts we received - they were all so good, but if I had to choose a stand out, the sunflower and chocolate dessert was super unique and devine as the textures and flavors was something that I've never had in a dessert before. My bf and I did not leave a trace left on the plate haha.

Overall an amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"Tried Canis for the first time recently and had an amazing experience. The space is inviting, simple and contemporary. The staff are amazing and helpful. The food was exceptional. Well thought out, refined and elevated but still approachable. Their menu is set up as a pre fix with multiple options for each course, the only problem is wanting to try everything. A well curated wine list complements the exceptional menu. Overall an amazing experience and the best food I have had in Toronto.A must try on your next night out. Highly recommended***"}
{"text":"We had the smaller tasting menu and added the duck confit since someone in our group was really hungry!  Beef ribs were really tender.  I loved the duck. Dessert was a blondie which I didn't care for, but the rest of the table thought it was delicious.  Everything was really tasty.  We tried an orange wine because we had never heard of that before.  It paired well with the beef ribs and duck.  Expensive, but I felt it was worth it for the quality and quantity of food.  Service was friendly and excellent."}
{"text":"I came based on reviews from yelp and Toronto life. We chose the 7 course tasting menu. The food was quite good, portions decent, and the flow of the meal was good. 

My favorite was the scallop with Apple and turnip, the beef tartare, and the pork belly with cabbage. The duck was also excellent! We went on a Wednesday and the restaurant was not very busy."}
{"text":"Flavours, plating, service, ambiance are all 10/10. These guys are slick, unobtrusive but super attentive service and fantastic, flavorful, creative dishes. This is definitely a top quality restaurant by any standard. IMO the pork and duck dishes were better than the fish, but otherwise, eat everything."}
{"text":"In Toronto we have lots of choices when it comes to restaurants and it is a challenge to stand out. Canis is phenomenal! The server was professional and well informed. The food was spectacular. The menu consists or a choice of two tasting menu's and the table is expected to select the same tasting  menu. They were very accommodating with with allergies and food restrictions. The atmosphere is elegant and unpretentious. This is a high end restaurant so expect to
the bill to be on the upper end, but that said it is worth every cent. The wine pairings were very good and decent sized pours. Book well in advance as they are very popular."}
{"text":"Not a single dish disappointed. Not one. It was the perfect blend of comfort and palate-pushing with the cohesiveness of a truly great culinary staff.  There's not a lot I can say here because I enjoyed this so, so much. We were visiting Toronto from Philly and were looking for something we wouldn't find anywhere else. Canis was very reminiscent of some of the best elements of BYO culture in Philly (no one can get a liquor license so some of the most well-crafted menus and star chefs have 25 seat BYOs) but with a wine pairing menu that took the guess work out of the process. I'd recommend this place (and, again, every single dish on the menu) to anyone willing to put a little faith in a credible chef."}
{"text":"We came here for the 8-course tasting menu and it was brilliant from start to finish! Excellent job on wine pairing and clever ways of using and pairing ingredients made every bite a delight. The flavours of all the dishes here are familiar yet unique. Awesome job on the plating as well.

For a restaurant that is ranked #15 in the top 100 Canada's best restaurants (as of 2018), reservation was relatively easy to come by. Having dined at other \"top\" establishments before, I am surprised Canis did not rank in the top 10, as I can honestly say the flavours here are better.

Service was attentive without being over-bearing or pretentious. You can come dine here comfortably in reasonably casual clothing without feeling out of place.

My favourite dishes were the dessert, especially the sunflower sorbet with a chocolate wafer on top! Hooked the second I tasted it - so delicious!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best overall meal I've ever had. The staff was extremely attentive and super nice. Our waitress also gave us some suggestions for late night drinks in the area. 
My partner and I decided to go with the four course tasting menu and we chose to try each of the two options for the courses. The squid dish with peas and pork was the best thing I have ever eaten. The koji ice cream with almonds and white chocolate changed my life with its combination salty/sweet flavor. The next time we're in Toronto we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Canis is a new restaurant focuses on Canadian cuisine. I was attracted by the beautiful photos of the honey glazed duck, so decided to try it out.

Service: very prompt and friendly. The staff and chef clearly explained the ingredients of each dishes when the dishes arrived. The pace was moderate and gave enough time for us to enjoy each bite of the beautiful food.

Food: we have tried a a few items on the menu

Complimentary sourdough bread with fresh cheese and chimichurri-
Bread was served warm and soft on beautiful wooden plate and cutlery. The cheese and chimichurri were both flavourful and delicious.

Beef Tartare -
Beef tartare was covered by the kale powder and you mixed the garlic aioli,  sunflower seeds, pickled onions and chives well before eating. I put the beef tartare on the crispy potato chips and each bite was unforgettable.

Ricotta Stuffed Pasta -
Fresh ricotta stuffed pasta serve with mushroom sauce/broth. I could smell the fresh mushroom aroma when the dish arrived. The pasta was so juicy inside and sooooo good! The sauce/broth (the texture is not thick so I call it broth) was so good that we finished it all.

Duck for two -
The chef first presented the beautiful whole duck at the table before he return it to the kitchen to carve and plate it with wheat berry and onion puree. Then, the staff pour the duck jus to finalize the presentation.  The duck meat was very tender, juicy and flavourful. I think it is the best duck I haven't had for awhile.

I will definitely go back to try other dishes; every dish is well orchestrated and gives us surprise. We need more restaurants like Canis in Toronto."}
{"text":"Our self-curated tasting menu began with the beets and albacore tuna. Both were plated like pieces of art and left us wanting more. The beets were well-disguised when they arrived, appearing more like a tagliatelle pasta than an earthy vegetable. As I unravelled the curled beets, I revealed dehydrated beets, toasted almonds, mint and chèvre. The flavours, although far from novel, were spot-on and evoked a sense of Canadian familiarity. I was equally impressed with my guest's albacore tuna, which was served sashimi-style under a bed of herbs, and it immediately transported my taste buds to the Pacific Coast. It was paired with the most delightful and creamy herb emulsion (that could have used some extra bread to soak up!)."}
{"text":"Incredible hospitality. Amazing vibe and decor. Food speaks for itself. A must see in Toronto for everyone."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

The duck!! When you're making reservations, make sure you reserve on a day when they're making duck! People were telling me to wait for it and go on the days when they make duck and boy were they right on! The duck was definitely worth it!

The difference between the menus are 6 and 8 course meal. Only the 8 course meal offers the duck though! There's no a la carte and the description for the prix fix menu is very simple and straightforward. 

The dishes were placed very simply on the plates and each course offers a uniqueness to the flavor combinations that I haven't seen before. It's different and the flavor combinations make you wonder on how many ways chef can combine flavors and ingredients. 

Right from the first course to the last, I was amazed by the unique flavors from each dish that were highlighted in the way the dishes were made. Not found anywhere else, Canis offers a daring and extraordinary way of combining ingredients not seen anywhere else. 

My favorite dish would have been the duck. Nicely sliced, aged 3-4 weeks and cooked right at the texture where the meat is just about cooked. Duck meat was tender and juicy, and crispy on the outside. 

The desserts were also really good. Yogurt sorbet tasted light and inviting for more. And the chocolate mousse had a unique combination of sunflower seeds to mix in the taste of chocolate with the seeds. 

LAST TIP?!

I suggest if you're coming in as a couple to opt to sit by the kitchen. It's like the chef's table over there and hopefully you can learn a trip or two! Always call in and confirm if they have the duck made during the week you're near the restaurant. Either duck or lamb...so be smart about which main course you want!!"}
{"text":"Above average overall.

Food looks better than it tastes.  It starts bland but builds in flavour profile.   Wine pairings were nicely done and a highlight.
Decor was very average, the focus is good  food as it should be however not cheap.  You will average $120 + tax and tip each."}
