{"text":"Difficile a comprendre que la moyenne des avis est de 4/5 (en date d'octobre 2015) et qu'ils ont gagne des prix...  Soit c'etait bon a leur debut, soit les gens n'ont pas le sens de la critique.  Les portions sont tres petites et les prix eleves.  En plus a ce prix c'est du self service et des ustensiles en plastique.  Deux petites tranches de brisket a 18$ inclusant mini salade de choux, mini pain et mini accompagnement. En plus la viande n'est pas assez chaude, et les cotes levees sont sèches........ Du vol ??"}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich and brisket platter are awesome.
I had previously had the pork ribs, and was not too fond of them, but I am willing to give them another try.
Sweet and spicy BBQ sauces available on the counters and tables are delicious.  
Great selection of side dishes."}
{"text":"As I previously wrote, the hype is so strong for Blackstrap BBQ that my expectations were probably too high. Also, it doesn't help that my wife's recipes for dry ribs, pulled pork and slaw are out-of-this-world delicious...

I apologize in advance for a review that will be mostly on the negative side of things...

Here we go:

Seeing how the restaurant is tiny and that they don't accept reservations, we decided to order out and take it back home...

We were four and we each chose something different so that we could try them all...

First disappointment: when we called, before rush hour at dinner time, we were told that they were out of brisket. We're talking Wednesday night at 5:00pm. KINDA odd. I understand that everything is fresh and that it's possible to run out of certain items once in a while...but we're talking mid-week, pre-peak time. They even mention on their website that they may run out of food...as if it was a good thing?!

Again, I understand that everything is fresh and cooked for a long time, that they do not want to cook too much food and waste it but we're talking about a restaurant that is just opening and has to build its reputation. Mind you...seeing the amount of 5 stars on here...it seems like they already did. 

Anyhoot, this left a somewhat sour taste in my mouth (and I wasn't even the one to order brisket!)

Speaking of sour...their slaw could definitely use a little LESS vinegar in it. Was not to my taste at all...

As a main, I ordered the turkey sandwich with braised green. Aside from the fact that it was cold (we're a 5 minutes car ride away from the resto and it was 15 outside...), the sandwich was ok. I'd give it a 3 out of 5. As far as the greens go, they were also cold and watery. Not what you'd expect from a side of braised greens.

Moved on to the ribs...didn't really understand what the fuss was all about. 

Same for the pulled-pork. The sweet taste that I like so much about pulled-pork was missing. 

On the plus side, the FRIED MACARONI AND CHEESE balls...WOW...amazing! If I had only ordered that...my review would also be 5 stars!

Note that I did NOT try the burnt end poutine but one of the peeps in our party did and loved it.

All in all, because I live in the hood, I'll eventually give Blackstrap another shot. Hope I'll be able to post a more positive review that time...

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Simply put, this is the best BBQ place in the city. Michael Jordan vs. the Special Olympics. That good.

While that may not be saying much in a city where BBQ can mean anything, this place outranks places like Boucan (where the pulled pork poutine is quite good)

Pros
- amazing food. Must haves : ribs, pulled pork, deep fried mac and cheese balls, burnt bits poutine
- good value : \"Le Gros\" includes everything above, including greens, cooked beans, and brisket, for 35$
- very unpretentious
- take out works well

Cons
- they sell out (twitter feed will update you)"}
{"text":"Having tasted a lot of BBQ and smoked anything i have to say that i am willing to sell my mother for some of their brisket.  I have never seen a smoke ring so deep.   And dear god do i ever recommend their burnt ends poutine.  The first time i went i asked them what they did with the shavings that were left on their slicer and the guy with a huge grin said that is what goes in the poutine sauce.   I have been there four times, since they opened and they are always packed, yet their staff is always smiling and joking with the patrons the two guys behind the counter are a treat all in themselves.  The best part is that they are getting a second smoker all the way from Tennessee."}
{"text":"Take a second and admire the hard work of the smoke permitting the meat, providing a fleshy pink ring to the brisket. The bark was sweet and mysterious and lent just the right amount of seasoning - the slaw also helped cut through the heaviness of the meat. The heap of meat in between the buns was generous; rubbed with spices, penetrated by smoke... and then I just took the description of the sandwich into a totally different place"}
{"text":"Everything here tastes really good, specially the chicken and ribs. The poutine is delicious."}
{"text":"Nice little place, friendly staff. The food was really good, very tasty ! Can't wait to taste another dish from their menu !"}
{"text":"First impressions is there is no signage outside! So you need to know where you are going to find it. Loud 70s rock greets you at the door. Not much seating but if you can get a seat with some friends try 'le gros' which has a bit of everything. 
I loved their ribs but everything here is good. Would come back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"This is a great place!  While they are still working out the bugs of being a hit restaurant from their first week (unlike most restaurants,) they really have a great thing going.

In Montreal, it is easy to find a good poutine all over the place.  The burnt ends poutine at Blackstrap is the best damned poutine I have ever had.  A tad on the salty side, it works.  From the dry fries that soak up the amazing gravy to the chunks of delicious brisket, this is the only poutine I find myself eating now.

I love a good dry rib.  By dry I mean not slathered in some goopy, overly sweet sauce.  They have a great sweet sauce you can add yourself, but they thankfully let you decide how much you want by leaving it at the table.  

The Mac and Cheese balls are deliciously cheesy and crunchy all at the same time.  It is hard to order just enough for your meal since every single thing I have tasted so far is great.  I want it all, every time.

Friday and Saturday night can be really busy, but no matter when you go, the food is amazing.   Go!  Eat!"}
{"text":"I went there during the \"Montreal poutine week\" , their brisket poutine was so good, the meat was very tasty, however, the service was slow , we had waited about half an hour to have the poutine and there are not many tables, so maybe takeaway is better."}
{"text":"Food: The food is amazing, the meat is tender and flavourful, but on the heavy side. Thank god for the coleslaw and greens. Of course if you have a heavier taste the home sauce on the table will make you satisfied for sure~ Probably one of the best BBQ place in Mtl~

Service: Semi-selfserve, especially when it's busy. You pay at the counter, the food is brought to you then you are left on your own, which is ok for me to pour my own water etc.

Value: You may find it expensive but it's enough to make you full for 2 meals~

Ambiance: A tiny shop on Verdun with open kitchen concept. Inside there are long wooden tables with bench, makes you feel homey-comfy."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, great meats, good poutine. Not so many seats, better luck finding one if alone or only 2. Many people take out."}
{"text":"Having had BBQ in Texas, I wasn't expecting much from Canada. But the brisket was really good, in addition to the beans and fries. They could use a wider selection of BBQ sauce than just sweet and spicy (more vinegar tasting than pepper-based heat). Servers and cooks were friendly."}
{"text":"Mmm beef and pork taste the same, is the same taste of smoked meat (the sandwich).
I just taste the pork but i eat the beef and I could not finish it, it has a \"cloying\" flavor."}
{"text":"Hit this place up on a recent trip to Montreal based on the recommendation of a friend. I gotta say, it was great. I got the chicken and rib dinner. Their ribs were absolutely incredible, dry but amazing. Some of the best ribs I've ever had at a bbq joint. I tasted their chicken wings and they were also great. I'm not really a poutine guy but I had some of the brisket poutine that my friend ordered....it was really good. Just be advised that if you order extra meat with your poutine, it's $10! I don't know if it's worth it or not because I don't know what a normal serving would come with. But his was loaded with meat and delicious. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"C'est bon mais un peu cher pour ce que c'est. Légumes très huileux. J'aurais aimé de la sauce pour tremper le poulet, la viande était sèche. La poutine à la viande avait l'air vraiment hot par contre. Excellent chausson au pommes."}
{"text":"Good food, amazing chile con carne. You order at the counter and they bring you the food."}
{"text":"You want real bbq. You got to try blackstrap bbq.  Its so good it will make a grown man cry.  
Only bad part of this place is that since I live in saint-jerome, thay don't deliver to my home ( too far)."}
{"text":"YELPERS! Take note ~ you have GOT to try this place (and then probably come in every other week!) - big fan already, of this unique place in Verdun

Atmosphere:  The Blackstrap place that specializes smoked barbecue (very slow cooked) meats.  Dilan, the owner / chef, spent the summer of 2012 competing in BBQ competitions (these sort of things exist?) all over the U.S., even wining acclaim for his Brisket receipt.  The seating is basic and the place is set up with a distinct rustic feel to it.

Service:  Partly help-yourself (i.e. you must pick up your food at a counter) partly waiter service (you can ask the staff if you have requests).  I found the people there downright loveable, and very very accommodating and approachable.  You'll love coming here for the crowd too ~ youngish and usually in groups, the place fills up quite a bit at dinner time.

Food:  Top (top) marks.  Unlike the run of the  mill BBQ places around the city (think Baton Rouge, St. Hubert, & Scores) Blackstrap smoke BBQs their meat slowly, giving the meats (Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Turkey) a dry (non-greasy) hickory flavour.  Absolutely the best BBQ, to be had.  Made as a plate or in a sandwich, the menu items are too the point, and made to satisfy (I'm a big fan of uncomplicated menus).  Blackstrap makes their own BBQ sauces (sweet or spicy) for those who like a little moisture on their meal, and offers a set of side dishes (fries, bbq beans, deep-fried mac'n cheese balls, coleslaw salad). Prices for all this deliciousness (and generous amounts) is beyond reasonable, it's a downright bargain.

A must visit place ~ thank me later!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome , love the beer! & the vibe is really wicked. Like what a real bbq place should look like. The mac n cheese is heaven in a bite , I love the pulled pork! And can we just say hoe amazing is the burnt end poutine!!! Ahhhhh I cant deal!! Simply amazing."}
{"text":"We had been searching for a good place to get some Southern BBQ and this place exceeded expectations!

We brought a few friends that were also interested in BBQ and headed out on a Friday evening. We got there around 7 pm and they were quickly running out of things, but there was still lots of good options to choose from- but get there before 7 pm if you can! This is less of a problem in the summer when they have a second smoker out back so they have twice as much of everything.

We had the pork and chicken, collard greens, and deep fried Mac and cheese! Everything was excellent and I particularly liked the spicy BBQ sauce. We also had the very yummy burnt ends poutine! 

The staff is super knowledgeable and the owners clearly know what they are doing when it comes to BBQ. It is a tiny place but is a great fun atmosphere and everyone there is clearly enjoying themselves - from the staff to the patrons. 

Since our first visit, both is and the friends we took have all been back multiple times for take out. There is always a big line up and the food never disappoints. Plus - we all wanted to try the BBQ ribs! Sooooo good."}
{"text":"Hands down. Best BBQ in Montreal. Ambience, food, service, price, bars, neighbourhood... Well done guys!!"}
{"text":"hmmmm, what's all the fuss about?

ok, first off the staff is very friendly and helpful, they are good people.

That said, the bbq, is just lacking. We ordered Le gros, with the burned ends poutine.

Le gros pretty much has everything, ribs, pulled pork and chicken. Mac n cheese, fried green, fries, coleslaw, baked beans, and pickles. The burned ends poutine had pulled pork.

It all sounds impressive, and having read they won some gold medal at some bbq competition... honestly, the ribs were dry, the meat was tough and not fall of the bones at all. That's the most disappointing thing really. then the pulled pork which was moist and good but then some pieces were clearly sliced, which doesn't give it the same texture as pulled...

the roast chicken was the only thing I liked, it was moist and tasted good. The coleslaw was nothing special, fries were very good. The baked beans, well it seems they put some sort of herbs in it which I did not like, and they were a bit too tangy for me... 

There are two bottles of bbq sauce on the table, a sweet one and a spicy one. I guess you're supposed to add it to the meat and eat, so you only put as much as you need... I'm not fond of this set up, I like my bbq drenched in the sauce as it cooks so the sauce permeates the meat, just my thoughts... and yes even with dry rub you brush some sauce on there to finish it off before serving!!! yeah all the meat had no bbq sauce on them!!!  whatchou talkin bout  Willis?

The poutine was ok, not enough sauce and pulled pork didn't add anything, was I supposed to add the bbq sauce on the poutine?

I was hoping for something good, but even for dry rub, ribs should not be so dry and tough to eat... did I get a bad batch?"}
{"text":"Very small place that does mostly take-out.  It has room for about 20 customers or so. 
Tried most of  the meats they offer.  The ribs are the best I've tried in Montreal.  They are a bit sweet but not overly so.  The beef and chicken are ok but nothing extraordinary.
They also offer a slushy margarita that seemed popular.  Although I didn't try it I can see how it would go very well with the ribs.

If you're into ribs definitely a place to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Fun little location for a fun little barbeque spot.  

Service is friendly and quick, and the menus are hand-written and taped to the wall.  

There's definitely a friendly community vibe going on at this eatery with the two large picnic tables up front and bench seating in the back.  

Be wary of coming during peak hours, because the line-up could go out the door.  Luckily, I arrived just before the big rush and managed to get a spot at the table.

What I liked about the menu is that it only had the essentials, which made selection relatively easy.  I went with the ribs plate, which comes with a side, coleslaw, and slices of pickle.  As the side, I chose the deep fried mac n cheese, which was delicious!  The beau had the pulled pork plate with a side of fries.

While the ribs were great and the pulled pork tender, the fries were a little too salty and it seemed that the seasoning was a little heavy on the acidity.  There was far too much vinegar in the coleslaw and hot sauce for our liking.  

Sadly, the brisket was sold out by the time we got there, so next time, we'll be back to try that and the burnt ends poutine."}
{"text":"On a pris la poutine burnt rends qui est excellente, avec son porc effiloché ! Un régal ! Pour une fois les frites ne baignaient pas dans la sauce comme c'est souvent le cas des poutines.
On a gouté aussi le sandwich au porc. Très simple, peu d'ingrédients mais efficace. La viande est vraiment excellente.
Seul point noir, c'est minuscule à l'intérieur, donc prévoir d'éviter les heures de pointes si vous voulez manger sur place."}
{"text":"Tried the Brisket, Turkey sandwich, fries, coleslaw and the mac and cheese. Nothing impressive. It's a place to eat at if you're close but not one you'd drive all the way to.

Seating is nice."}
{"text":"La viande etait tres bonne c'est un peu chere mais les ailes et le brisket etaient on point !"}
{"text":"As someone who compulsively had to read all 70+ reviews, I knew going in that the burnt ends poutine, ribs, and brisket were the most generally well received items. So that's exactly what we ordered. (With a side of Mac and cheese balls -- because, why not?) 

I really wanted to love the brisket/brunt ends poutine, but it was just a smidge too salty for me. 

I'm not a big rib person mainly because of how messy they generally are. So what I did really like about BSBBQ was that the ribs were dry-rubbed so while you could add as much additional sauce that you wanted, you could also eat them \"as is\" and they weren't messy, and still had loads of flavour. However, my husband (who loves ribs) only ranked Blackstrap BBQ as second (diablos is first, and le boucan is third) in ribs.

All in all, a bit of an uneven experience. We both thought the Mac and cheese was delicious, I loved the ribs and my husband was slightly lukewarm about them, and the poutine was generally a miss. Not likely somewhere we would go again unless we wanted take-out and were in the area. Because honestly, for roughly the same price, diablos has much more to offer in terms of atmosphere, drink options, and location for people looking to \"dine in\" and relax at a restaurant with some friends."}
{"text":"you must go eat here if you like bbq!!! the best in the city hands down.  i ate everything on the menu and it was all amazing."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and had a pork sandwich, which was an amazing experience. I am a big fan of BBQ, and have eaten a LOT of it. Being still newish to Montréal, I have yet to try all the noteworthy BBQ places, but this was the best pork sandwich I have had yet. I always start out getting pulled pork at a BBQ place because, in my opinion, it's pretty difficult to screw up, and it gives me a good idea of what else to expect from the other items on the menu. In the case of Blackstrap, I cannot wait to try more! Although first my experience at Blackstrap was fantastic, I am reserving my full five-star approval until I try their ribs, which to me is the true test of BBQ."}
{"text":"If my review was based solely on the food I would give Blackstrap 5 Stars. The ribs were amazing, chicken nicely smoked and the fries were perfect. Generous portions as well as good sauces available table-side.

Unfortunately the service was quite terrible. When we first walked in we were quickly greeted by our waitress and instructed to make our way to the cash to order. She was friendly and helpful with questions regarding some of the choices on the menu. We quickly decided what to order and oddly were asked to pay right then and there. Since I was paying with my credit card I had no choice to tip in advance. Well, not surprisingly the service greatly suffered from that point on. The food was ready quickly and brought over to our table right away by our waitress, and that was the last we saw of her. Never did she ask if we wanted ketchup, she never asked how our food was and we even ended up pouring own glasses of water from a jug next to the cash. She was great, until we tipped in advance and then she was non-existent afterwards.

I will definitely go back to Blackstrap due to the quality of the food however I will make sure to bring cash and tip only after my meal.

p.s. I don't normally write yelp reviews however this experience was just too much to ignore."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! I always take reviews with a grain of salt because you can't please everyone but I should've listened. Very tasty food but not near enough of it. Extremely small portions - so bad that my husband had to go eat elsewhere to get filled up!!! Fries are a cheap fillet and they don't even give you enough of those. Paid $57 for food that wouldn't have satisfied a child. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Mouthwatering BBQ!!! The chicken was tender and cooked to perfection and I can't say enough about their macaroni balls. Looking forward to going again soon!!"}
{"text":"I would definitely eat here again. I had the brisket plate with french fries and coleslaw.  The brisket was delicious, perfectly spiced and very salty! The french fries were also great, as was the coleslaw.  I like the atmosphere of the place, with small touches like the roll of brown paper on each table.  Another member mentioned this, and I agree, wholeheartedly, the beer selection could use some work.  There are a few craft beers to choose from that cost 7-8$ per bottle.  I think they could pick up their beer game and make some more money by selling a wider selection of beer at a better price.  This place ain't cheap for comforting, binge food (this is like, the ultimate hangover lunch) but it's a nice treat.  I think it would make great for take out as well.  Any pub that could pull off food like this would be off the chain."}
{"text":"The brisket is tender, thick cut and perfectly set with the tangy coleslaw on its bun. Fries are crunchy and well seasoned. 
Burnt end poutine is so amazing, crunchy fries, tons of cheese and a rich thick sauce that has a bacony taste
Also try the fried Mac' so good!"}
{"text":"Good bbq joint dry rubbed chicken is my favourite of all the meets. Ribs are good, pulled pork and brisket are ok sometimes a bit dry. Poutine is huge and with brisket adds a smoked touch. Good place for takeout or quick meal."}
{"text":"Great location. Small place. Food: Very good. Made with love. Sauces was vinaigry. Portions are too small. Portions are small for the price. I know the price of beef went up, but come on. Service: good. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Small portions and not worth it for the money. You get a half rack of OVERLY dry ribs. Fries were crispy, but we had to ask for extra crispy. I wouldn't come again because you can get juicier ribs for cheaper somewhere else."}
{"text":"nothing special here, not sure what all the fuss is about. long line, slow service, mediocre food...... Bofinger is better and thats not saying much seeing as Bofinger aint that great either"}
{"text":"Went to Blackstrap in between work and an appointment and wanted something quick so I got the pulled pork sandwich! I was quite disapointed that the pork had no sauce/flavor... It was serve with two sauces on the side... Which means I had to open my sandwich and put sauce on the burger myself! I thought this was not the high Blackstrap BBQ standard I was told about... All in all I'm in no hurry to go back! I hope for their sake that the ribs have sauce :O"}
{"text":"Best I've ever had! I have not been disappointed with one thing I've ordered from them. The staff is always awesome. Burnt ends poutine is incredible."}
{"text":"Super. Tout est succulent. Les ribs,  poulet,  brisket,   frites, poutine de loin ma préférée à Montréal. Ça vaut le coût et le détour."}
{"text":"I hate writing negative review but I hope the owner takes a good note for once. This place Is not at all what it used to be. The brisket was dry and rock hard. I was expecting a hi or hello when I walked on a Monday night but not 'Sorry, we sell meat here only'. Ok I get that I am indian but all Indians are not vegetarian not even half of the whole indian population."}
{"text":"I love bbq. I've tried almost every bbq place I can find in the American south, and midwest states, and this weird little place in Verdun more than holds its own. Easily the best, juiciest ribs I've had in Canada.

Lots of reviewers have talked about their poutine, but ...  personally, I don't like poutine, so I didn't try their poutine. If you do like poutine, then maybe our tastes in food are not compatible. But if you don't care for poutine, and would still like to know if their fries are good, man, let me tell you, they are perhaps the best fries I've had.

Great bbq like you find in the states, but fries done right, with white vinegar, like you can only find in Canada. It's a perfect combination."}
{"text":"The sandwiches there are really good and the deep fried macaroni cheese is just awesome!!! one of the best bbq places in montreal."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Montreal! Great for eating in or taking out, good service, burnt ends poutine is amazing."}
{"text":"Allegedly some of the finest BBQ to be found in Canada if the accolades are to be believed. Having spent a year in the US South I tend to have a very skewed perspective on what good/bad BBQ is. Blackstrap is definitely not a threat to most southern big name pitmasters but does a good job in their own right at keeping the tradition alive and well up north.

The ribs got picked clean on my visit. Chicken just as well despite a tiny bit of dryness. Didn't touch the bun as I'm watching my gluten but it whispered seducdively to me with its fresh baked scent.

Come early for lunch or risk getting stuck in the loooong line winding all the way out the door and into the street. Oh, and have those wet wipes handy before you dig in."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ (especially the sweet sauce.) You order from the counter. Price is reasonable. The fried mac & cheese reminds me a bit of fried cheese croquettes. The brisket was a bit dry, but adding the sweet sauce made it delicious. The ribs were wonderfully smoky. The cole slaw was vinegar based and very tasty. Seating is at a few tables. Nothing fancy, but does the job."}
{"text":"Rather than trying our luck with squishing five people into the restaurant, we decided to get takeout and I think we made a good choice.  Opening up the takeout containers while sitting around my sister's kitchen table, it felt like she had returned from picking up dinner at a friend's house.  A friend that is an AMAZING cook.

We had a sampling of everything, aka \"le gros\", an order of chili fries and a dozen chicken wings.  This was the perfect amount of food for the five people we were chowing down.  Everyone ate until very satisfied, and there were even some leftovers.  I was wowed by the fact that while all the different meats tasted like \"bbq\", it was all different flavours and didn't all taste the same.  I really like the chicken wings, they are super meaty, not the little wimpy wings I'm used to.  And the flavour!  Delicious!  Move over Colonel Sanders, because THIS is finger lickin' good!  The sides were good too, the baked beans in particular with their smoky molasses flavour.  I wasn't super amazed by the fried mac and cheese, but I can see the appeal, it just wasn't my thing (but then I'm not a huge mac and cheese fan either).  The chili fries were delicious: this isn't your typical Wendy's style chili, this is braised beef goodness!  Think the bbq version of an Italian poutine."}
{"text":"J'adore leur sandwich Pulled Pork , il est savoureux et juteux. Un endroit à découvrir !"}
{"text":"To be honest, I didn't find the place that amazing like other Yelpers' reviews. We had the Brisket Poutine from La Poutine Week's special, and a Pulled-Pork Sandwich with Deep-Fried Mac&Cheese.

The poutine was fabulous, the gravy was exceptionally tasty, but only small pieces of brisket can be found here and there. Seriously, where are the meats? It's suppose to be a \"Brisket\" Poutine, come on.

The pork was slightly dry, and tasted kinda bland, but the texture was great. In addition to the homemade slaw and their special sauce, the sandwich was something special. The mac&cheese was really tasty, and they weren't kidding with the amount of cheese in there, superb!

Gonna come back for the burnt ends and ribs soon!"}
{"text":"Came her on my first night in Montreal since it is walking distance to where we are staying. I got the burnt ends poutine and my mom got a basic BBQ sandwich with slaw.
Overall pretty good, the poutine was pretty delish!  My mom gobbled up the BBQ sandwich in no time. Had to ask for ice for my drink, andy mom got water which they did not bring her, so she had to ask. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having Blackstrap BBQ cater our weekend lunch party at work last week and after hearing that there is finally a Louisiana style BBQ joint in MTL, well, colour me happy.

I had a huge serving of beef brisket, a pulled pork sandwich, and of course collard greens, beans and slaw. Now the slaw goes best shoved into the pulled pork sandwich. The sweetness of the pulled pork contrasts the vinegar of the slaw. Count that as a tip for anyone green to BBQ foods.

I loved their food and the owners are good people and great servers. I would love to go to their store in Verdun to try their poutine as well."}
{"text":"I was invited to this place for a Poutine Committee with a bunch of people here so my expectations, I must admit, were high.

For some odd reason, the name \"Blackstrap BBQ\" seems to not have been labeled on the store. If I didn't know I had to stop at 4436 Rue Wellington to meet my Yelp gangstas, I would have walked straight passed it supposing it is an extension of the neighboring shop.

I tried the famous \"Burnt Ends\" poutine and found it a bit disappointing when looking at the price of such a small portion. On the plus side, the sauces furnished tasted fantastic. 14$ for a portion that I can hold in both of my hands is not worth it. My amazing super duper Yelp BFF Sarah also found 2 hairs in her poutine. I, on the other side, am too much of a fatty happy kid to have noticed the possible hairs in mine. I didn't see any nets worn by the staff. 

The beer was incredibly expensive for the piss customers pay for. (I'm not hating on their beer, but to me, all beers tastes like piss. Some types of urine are more drinkable than others.) Also there was a heavy layer of foam on top and they were served in a cheap little plastic cup. You'd think you'd be entitled to at least a small glass after paying 7$ for a 12oz of beer of budweiser. Might as well just serve Heineken cans for 5$ each. The meal wasn't bad but not worth the money. 

The service was a bit slow but after a quick look at the restaurant, I noticed business was initially slow when we came in and therefore nothing was cooking when we arrived. I'll give the benefit of the doubt for this time. The service consisting in calling someone's name out is inefficient. Just code the cash register to print out an order number which will be called out by the chef. Since I'm an immigrant, it took the chef a grand number of 4 (or 5?) calls before I finally understood that I was the \"Mi-hey\" they were crying for.

The tables were nice, it was decently spacious for such a little restaurant. It was worth going there once but I wouldn't go again.

I was thankfully in good company at the time. :)"}
{"text":"Très bon resto dans Verdun. Ambiance conviviale, plats à partager le Texas à trois délicieux. Les bouchées de mac & cheese sont délicieuses et leurs viandes aussi. Le staff est super sympa, mais pas de commande aux tables par contre."}
{"text":"I went to Blackstrap when it first opened and enjoyed it very much. Since then, I'm not sure what's happened but the quality seems to have gone down with meats being dry and tough. 

We ordered delivery (something new for Blackstrap?) yesterday and it was a straight up disaster. If you offer delivery, and especially if you charge extra for it (+$3.00), please do it well. 

We ordered two plates, both of which are supposed to come with a side. 
They forgot one plate entirely, delivered us one plate with the wrong side, and added the two sides that we originally ordered as \"extras\" (so we were charged the full amount for the two sides that were supposed to be included with our plates). 

We called to try to rectify the issue. The person on the phone could not understand, for the life of her, what had gone wrong with the order, and that the two sides we had ordered were supposed to be included with the plates. 30 minutes later, they sent us the missing plate (no sides, no sauce) and charged the full amount for it. 

Sorry, Blackstrap - but it's the last time."}

The ribs were dry and tougher to chew than beef jerky (no exaggeration, I had to pull with force to bite it off). The macaroni was bland and, like the ribs, also dry. The bbq sauces were overpowered by vinegar. 

The Brisket was great though. However, for 20$ I was given the saddest piece of three ribs I've ever seen and a tiny portion of brisket. When you can go to a place downtown like Le Smoking BBQ and get a generous portion of better tasting BBQ for the same price, Blackstrap is just not worth the money... even if you live close to Verdun.

Oh yeah, there was a sausage too."}
{"text":"Came here last week while looking for a quick dinner date place and am glad I did! Although a little small with very limited seating, and the fact that it was packed, service was fast, and the food was good. We ordered the brisket with a side of fried mac and cheese as well as the ribs with fries. Both were good but the brisket was waaaaaaay better! Falling apart, super juicy, and absolutely delicious would be my description.. The ribs were also good but not better than those found at Bar-B-Barn.. Fries were delicious. Mac and cheese was super disappointing. Didn't really taste like anything. Neither one of us liked the accompanying coleslaw and left it pretty much untouched. Bread wasn't good either.

All in all a 3.5 rating, but since I can't allocate half stars (hint hint Yelp management :p), I'll round up because the staff was friendly and ambience was great. If you're in the mood for some BBQ, make your way here!"}
{"text":"Only one word: yeeeeehaaaw! Finally real southern BBQ cooked slow and low in Montreal. Word traveller, humble pit master, Blackstrap owner Dylan Kier is a young alchemist constantly looking for ways to perfect his culinary craft. The result is simply divine! Extremely friendly, the staff makes ordering lunch or dinner such a pleasure.

Last week, I ordered the pulled pork platter (very juicy) with a side baked beans (not too overdone like other places) and tangy cole slaw. Had to come back a week later for the dry rub smoked half-rack of ribs since they ran out. The trip back was worthwhile... also added an extra side of tasty beef brisket and hand cut fries. Don't forget to try both the sweet bbq sauce as well as the hot sauce (not that hot btw).

Will certainly return to try the \"burnt ends\" Poutine since it contains a good mix of lean and less lean brisket odds ends. For those working downtown, it's less than 15 minutes away by car - worth the detour!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's good to go outside downtown to find unknown gems.

Located in Verdun near the metro station this restaurant have everything you want in a BBQ.

I tried the chicken breast and it was delicious and everybody with me like their meal they said their ribs are excellent !

The service is like one in a cafeteria (order. wait at the table, and eat!) And the decoration is so so, it's not a place to go with a first date for sure, or maybe if you don't want more date go there ha ha !

One of the best BBQ restaurant in Montreal : Blackstrap BBQ !


Parfois c'est bien d'aller plus loins que le centre-ville cela permets de trouver de petites perles !
Situé à Verdun (station de l'église) ce restaurant possède tous ce que vous voulez comme viandes cuites au BBQ.

J'ai mangé une poitrine de poulet et c'était délicieux, tous le monde avec moi on bien aimés leurs repas and m'ont dis que leurs ribs étaient très bonnes !

Avec un service de restaurant ( Commander, attender à votre table et manger !), donc pas la place pour amener une première date, peut-être si vous ne voulez pas de 2ème date ha ha !
Une décoration très simple avec des bancs en bois.


Un des meilleur BBQ à Montréal : Blackstrap BBQ !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome :) I've been waiting for real southern bbq to appear in Montreal for years now and we finally have it :) My favourite is the ribs, although the chicken, brisket, pulled pork, poutine and sides are all amazing as well :)"}
{"text":"- everyone is already sayin to get Le Gros. Believe it. And get it. And  bring help to eat it.
- burnt ends poutine. a must have while they still serve it. top poutine in montreal in my opinion.
- i wish i lived in montreal
- as a tip, we went super early because we heard that the place sells out quickly, and once they're out... they're done. 
- to help mitigate that.... https://twitter.com/bbqblackstrap"}
{"text":"Je donne la même note que la moyenne car je ne crois pas pouvoir évaluer ce restaurant à sa juste valeur. Je crois qu'ils utilisent un mode de cuisson qui est plus utilisé au É-U. Je n'y suis pas habitué et je n'aime pas la viande sèche.

Ce restaurant est plus pour les amateurs de viande comme les beefs jerkey. Rassurez-vous c'est très goûteux. La poutine est vraiment bonne.

C'est un peu dispendieux. Probablement que ça vaut son prix, mais encore contrairement aux participant de \"Souper Presque Parfait\", je ne veux influencé la note finale par ma méconnaissance."}
{"text":"I had that platter where you can try everything and the best thing in there was the fried mac and cheese, which I find hilarious considering its a bbq restaurant.
The ribs are dry, the brisket was ok, the pulled pork was ok. Nothing memorable to be honest.

I went back again to have mac and cheese cubes. Keep that up, I guess."}
{"text":"No variety.

I tried the sampler called Le Gros : it basically has everything they sell there. Individually they were okay but after tasting everything in Le Gros I quickly realized that everything tasted the same, whether it's the chicken or ribs or pulled pork, it tasted very salty and dry or overcooked. The fries were the most interesting thing about the sampler but again too salty and redundant taste wise vis a vis the meats and stuff.

For food to taste great you need contrast and there's no contrast at all.

The chicken, for example, wasn't even above than just average and how can anyone make chicken taste boring with a restaurant called Blackstrap BBQ?

It wasn't good enough to go back there."}
{"text":"Ribs are probably my favorite food (right after sushi) and this place doesn't let down. We got \"Le Gros\" for 40$ this is such a good deal. We got to try about of everything, ribs, chicken, pork and brisket. As well as coleslaw, 2 extra sides and 2 little buns. For the sides we got sweet potatoes and fried mac and cheese balls. The sweet potatoes to my disappointment, were just entire chunks of potato... I though they were going to be fries. But the fried mac and cheese balls O.M.G! Literally balls of deep fried m&c! AMAZING those were the best thing in the tray. A MUST GET
As for the meat the ribs were fall of the bone amazing. The pork was juicy and tender, much better than I expected. The brisket was ok abit dry and too peppery for my taste. The chicken was good but apart from the crispy skin its still just chicken.
The place is a mix between fast food and restaurant. You order at the counter upfront and pay right away. Give your name and they will call you when its ready. Which I like. Unfortunately not many places to sit inside. Mostly counter space and 2 picnic tables. But I get it adds to the rustic charm."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I saw this restaurant on MTL Blog's list of 101 Restaurants You Should Eat At Before you Die. Personally, I don't know that it should have made the list. The food for the most part was OK, their brisket was slightly dry, fries were good, pulled pork was alright, chicken, I have to say was juicy, and the fried mac'n'cheese was pretty damn delicious. Wasn't a fan of the coleslaw or the greens. Small place, giving a quaint feel, staff was great. Price point wasn't bad. Hated that they give plastic cutlery. Very difficult to cut away chicken with plastic. 
All in all, not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it again."}
{"text":"Bar B Q is very good so the food is 4 stars but the fact you can't get a seat to eat it brings it down to 3 stars
In the summer you can maybe sit outside but having to drive to it and then wait until you drive home to eat the food takes away from the work invested in the meals. 
I ate there once and it was very good. 
But don't go back because there is nowhere to sit if it's a bit busy."}
{"text":"Bon, je suis toujours aussi fan, mais ce qui devait arriver commence peu à peu à arriver, vu le grand succès du Blackstrap : les prix augmentent, mais les portions diminuent, eh oui. Anciennement, la fameuse poutine \" Burnt ends \" apparaissait au menu à 10 $ et débordait littéralement de viande! Maintenant, préparez-vous à payer 12,99 $ et à ne voir qu'une petite quantité de viande sur votre plat... Dommage :( Par contre, le goût ne change pas!

Le service est toujours aussi excellent et les employés sont vraiment gentils. 


Depuis quelques semaines, une nouveauté : du bon maïs au beurre parfumé au chipotle, miam! Un petit ajout parfait pour le temps estival!"}
{"text":"It's borderline overpriced and I can't stand their coleslaw, but the BBQ is very good and their \"burnt ends\" poutine is easily one of, if not the best poutine variant in the city."}
{"text":"Lots of hype, Everyone in this city is recommending this place and when you get there, there are hipsters lined down the street to get in, there is more bryl cream and dark rimmed glasses in here than a Buddy Holly look-a-like contest. Once you get over that you could be liking this place ironically and get down to it, the food is pretty good. 

It is a great place for lunch but the portions are too small for supper. What it does lack in quantity it makes up in quality. the mac and cheese doesn't really taste like mac and cheese it tastes like deep fried cubes that may or may not contain cheese or macaroni elbows. But come on, you are going here for the meat, its great, I ordered the brisket and also the turkey, both were just outstanding. 

Although I found the portions to be too small they do offer a $35 plate, jury is still out as to whether or not this is a one person entrée or two, I will find out on my next visit. 

I would definitely recommend getting it to go, unless of course you are enjoying it ironically, then stay and share a picnic table with other people possibly enjoying the food because it is delicious or because it is the new hip spot to be enjoyed by a hipster. Its too small for sitting inside even waiting for your food to go I got crashed into like crazy by people. its pretty cramped. Hopefully sales stay up and they can move to a larger location. 

I would for sure recommend, its clean, quaint, and above average quality."}
{"text":"104 avis Yelp et 4* de moyenne. Je m'attendais à manger quelque chose de WOWWWWW! Mais non, c'était bien correct. J'ai pris le sandwich à la dinde avec extra carrées de Mac&Cheese frit. Le Mac&Cheese j'ai bien aimé malgré qu'il était froid. Le sandwich était so so...une chance qu'il y avait deux sauces, une épicé (un peu épicé) et l'autre sweet. Les sauces etaient un peu vinaigré. 

J'étais avec un collègue et quand nous sommes rentré, il n'y avait aucun client. Je trouve que niveau espace, ils ont mal pensé. Il y a un comptoir haut avec des chaises qui donne face au mur. Manger devant un mur, ce n'est pas ce qu'il y a de plus exitant dans la vie. Et devant le resto, il y a deux tables à Pic nic de 8 places. Le resto avait tellement de trophée et bref je ne sais pas si c'est parce que j'ai pris la dinde que je n'ai pas trouver cela si bon. Il manquait d'épices et de goût. Par contre, quand on finissait de manger un groupe de 10 gars sont arrivé et ce sont assi à côté de nous, j'ai pu voir les autres plats , dont les ribs et la poutine qui avait un air succulent. J'essaierai cela la prochaine fois."}
{"text":"A customer told me of this place and I've been wanting to try it.

The day I went they were out of spare ribs so I ordered the roast beef and fries. It came with a side of greens. The fries were crispy and the meat flavorful and a little chewy. 

Definitely coming back for the spare ribs."}
{"text":"Cool concept. Used to go there often for pick ups (I don't go anymore simply bc I stopped eating meat) very good sauces on the side. Tasty ribs and brisket but a bit dry sometimes. Also went for Poutine Week - pulled pork pouts not bad!! 

Dislike : uncomfortable seating ; have to wait for seats and stand there with your food. Better to take it to go ;) unless u don't mind eating on a stool facing a wall :-)"}
{"text":"So I'm a girl from England who'd never had this smoked meat/barbecue stuff before I met my American boyfriend. Since I am also Jack Spratt's wife, I have loved every last morsel of flavourful meat in this category that I have tasted.

I was hesitant about trying Blackstrap as the reviews are somewhat mixed. However, some barbecue seemed like just the ticket on a wet, slushy end-of-the-world night, when I had nothing in my fridge.

He had the beef brisket with greens, and I had the pork with fries, and we shared. It was all moist and tasty, with burnt bits. The fries were also very flavourful and not too crispy or too soft. We particularly appreciated the slaw, which was nicely tart as opposed to the sweet stuff that Montrealers seem to prefer. Neither of us felt the need to add sauce to our meat - unadulterated seemed the best way to experience the flavour spectrum on offer. We washed it down with Black cherry and Ginger beer.

We sat at the bar, watching the guys prepare orders. The chicken looked super moist and tender too. Unfortunately they were out of ribs. (FYI, this was a Friday, a little before 8pm.) We'll definitely try the burnt-ends poutine next time.

The decor is simple but effective, with two tables with benches that could probably seat 8 per table. Otherwise there's the wall bar and the main bar. There's music that fits the fare, and it's loud enough to listen to but not so loud, it's intrusive. The staff/owners were friendly and helpful, and the overall experience certainly made us want to visit again."}
{"text":"En allant au Blackstrap  BBQ, j'avais des attentes assez élevées avec toutes les bonnes critiques que je lisais et tout le \"hype\" autour de ce nouveau restaurant.  

J'ai goûté au sandwich de porc effiloché, à la poutine burnt end et au macaroni frit.  Tout était délicieux, mais j'ai quand même quelques réserves.  

Tout d'abord, j'aime bien leur local.  Oui c'est petit! (2 tables seulement et des tabourets pour le comptoir) mais c'est tout à fait chaleureux. Ce n'est peut-être pas la place idéal pour des grands groupes.   Le personnel y est fort sympathique et le service est quand même assez rapide.  Mon sandwich était très bon.  On a le choix de deux sauces : piquante ou sucrée.  Cette dernière accompagnait à merveille mon sandwich.  La poutine burnt end est vraiment ma surprise.  La viande qui l'accompagnait fondait dans la bouche et était tout simplement divine! J'en veux encore!! Par contre, le macaroni frit m'a déçu.  Pas qu'il n'était pas bon, mais je préfère de loin, le macaroni au fromage fumé du Fumoir Rubs. Pour celui du Blackstap BBQ, il me faisait penser à de la fondue parmesan au niveau du goût.

Somme toute, j'ai bien aimé mon expérience."}
{"text":"I would have given a 5 star for taste I just think there prices are a bit high. On that note there poutines are amazing all of them and one of the BBQ sauses they gave with it was to die for friken addictive lol and the staff are actually plesent to talk with while waiting, wich is a big plus these days =)"}
{"text":"yeehawwww! Can I say that? Because I really get this Western/cowboy feel/atmosphere in this place. There is a wagon wheel and bull hooks etc and the decor is really cool. Now the food is really tasty but heavy I must say. I ordered the pork plate which is just pork meat, a side of coleslaw, a little cute small circular piece of bread, and fries. On the table was some house sauce (spicy and sweet) I loveedddd the pork and I loveeed the fries. It's not too cheap but it's not that expensive either. For my plate it was around 16 bucks, but you get really full. trust me! 

The restaurant is open kitchen concept which I think is great because my friend and I were intently watching the cooks make our food. We saw what looked like fried breaded cubes of something and it looked absolutely amazing! What really caught our eye was the brisket (chest) poutine. It's like super poutine. When I mean super it is poutine on another level...upgraded. I have to try that next time. I really enjoyed my experience here. Totally casual restaurant and great place to take friends (or a date!! why not!)

Really really really recommend this spot if you are on Wellington street in Verdun."}
{"text":"Vraiment bon mais y'a toujours trop de monde et peu de place pour s'assoir. C'est un peu dommage compte tenu de l'expérience que ce restaurant offre."}
{"text":"Étant végé à temps partiel (oui dit comme ça c'est weird...) je considère y retourner lorsque j'aurai vraiment envie d'un \"meat fix\". La qualité de la cuisson et de la viande est vraiment parfaite. Seul côté (vraiment minime) c'est le genre d'éclairage, j'aurais imaginé un peu plus lounge et moins \"bright\". Il devrait y avoir plus de petites tables aussi et moins de grande tables à \"pinic\".

Somme toute, je recommande! Surtout les ribs!"}
{"text":"J'y ai partagé une poutine \"burnt ends\" avec ma mère puisque nous étions en après-midi et que nous ne voulions pas trop gâcher notre souper. Je devais avoir de trop grosses attentes parce que j'ai été un peu déçue. Le fromage n'était pas très bon, et les \"burnt ends\" n'apportaient rien de spécial au met. Il faut dire que je suis plutôt difficile niveau poutine.

J'ai bien aimé l'ambiance Casse-croute/take out.

Je me promets d'y retourner pour goûter à autre chose du menu puisque j'y ai entendu tellement de bons commentaires."}
{"text":"Food was terrific, price was also affordable and the service from Abigail was very friendly...we felt wanted as customer...a great food experience in Verdun...a must try...and we will be back !"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm from the carolinas so I take my BBQ pretty seriously. I stumbled across this place in Montreal and decided to give their version of poutine a try. Seriously delicious, you can get it original like I did or you can add a variety of smoked meats to it. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is chill. Go in, get some poutine and a few beers and enjoy. Perfect when it's really cold outside! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Its a small place. I had the poutine which was awesome. The ribs are all right I guess. Not worth the extra drive if you live downtown, but if you happens to be in the neighborhood, def give it a try"}
{"text":"It's those small little shops that the neighborhood locals know about and are repeat customers.  It's very convenient to walk to if you live in the area. The ribs are good but some dishes risk being dry without the sauce. Despite that there's a good and steady stream of people eating there and getting take out. Their food is served in these tin trays which adds to the rustic feel of a ribs and BBQ place. They also have locally brewed beers on their menu because who eats ribs and meats with soda?  The prices are a bit higher, especially if you want to get a bit of everything.  It definitely doesn't fall into the cheap eats category. If you live nearby, it's probably better to bring it home and enjoy it that way because there really isn't much in terms of sitting room."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price but can be better specially for chicken but overall I will go there again so I recommend that place also forgot to say the poutine and froze are amazing in general"}
{"text":"Great brisket. Loved the fried mac'n cheese and the Cole slaw. Everything was fresh, with great taste, lean and not greasy. Really good meat. The service was fast."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ribs place! Its an order and sit kind of place. Love the simple western decor, picnic table.
The ribs and the fried mac & cheese is to die for! Very affordable price. 
I have eaten at a lot of ribs festival but nothing beats Blackstrap BBQ.  A must for ribs lover!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best BBQ I have had in Canada. I'm from the American South and we don't take our BBQ lightly. This it one of the few joints up here that I would say serve actual BBQ, and boy they do it right here! I had the burnt ends poutine, which was delicious. They had the proportions of gravy, fries, and curds done right. This dish was a perfect marriage between poutine and BBQ...It was godly. 

The only part that rubbed be the wrong way was the decorations. They were trying too hard to look country; although, the random blue dinosaur was funny."}
{"text":"Go to verdun for syrup festival, find this place on Yelp with good rates. Ordered chicken wings and ribs?ribs are little dry and chicken wings are too sweet. I will not come again."}
{"text":"A dire vrai, j'ai mis les pieds au Black Strap BBQ en connaissance de cause : c'est un Montréalais qui m'avait envoyée là-bas. J'étais donc certaine de me régaler.
Quand je me repasse le film de mes vacances, je me rends compte que j'ai bien failli ne pas y aller. Ce qui aurait très dommage. Très. Très très. Très beaucoup.
Une bonne partie de la salle est occupée par la cuisine : ici, rien à cacher ! La déco est teintée de western et on se demande si la pile de sacs de pommes de terre est là pour la déco ou pour la friteuse.
Côté bouche, c'est viande fumée ou viande fumée. Et mazette, qu'est-ce qu'elle est bonne ! Fumée maison tous les jours, elle est parfumée avec une sauce secrète. J'ai opté pour un sandwich au porc et j'ai bien regretté de ne pas avoir assez faim pour l'assiette dégustation, avec les spécialités emblématiques de la maison. La viande est savoureuse, fondante, parfumée, tout est parfait et rend cette expérience de la viande unique.
Sur les tables ou comptoir en intérieur, sur la terrasse aux beaux jours ou à emporter, le Black Strap BBQ est un passage incontournable pour les amateurs de bonne viande."}
{"text":"La bouffe était bonne, mais je m'attendais à plus. J'ai pris le sandwich au porc: la viande et le pain etaient bons, parcontre ca manquait de goût, de quelque chose. La salade de choux était tres decevante, c'est comme pas facile a rater! Mon ami a pris les cotes-levees qui étaient delicieuses avec des frites a se rouler par terre. Je salive encore en pensant aux frites volées a mon ami! C'est plus un resto pour apporter, car il y a deux tables pour s'asseoir et 2 comptoirs, et il faut commander a la caisse. Ca fait un peu casse-croute de luxe."}
{"text":"My new favourite BBQ joint in Montreal. Their ribs and brisket just melt in your mouth! Oh, and make sure you try the deep-fried mac&cheese bites, they give a whole new meaning to southern comfort food."}
{"text":"Man I hate writing reviews that border so close between 3* and 4*.  I don't want to give this place an \"average rating\" with a 3* but I also wasn't impressed enough to say it was a 4*.  This time, the Blackstrap BBQ gets notched down to 3*.

The food was good, but didn't blow me away.  I had the burnt-end poutine and the pulled pork sandwich.  The poutine was pretty much 4 stars, but the pulled pork sandwich was pretty average.  When I factored in the price (comparing to American BBQ I have had), I just didn't think the whole meal was quite worth the price.  I also found the BBQ sauce to not be as thick as I like it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing food.  Location is a bit small, but in a good way.
The brisket is incredible and I really love their spicy BBQ sauce.
Prices are a bit high compared to portions, but not totally out of whack.
The fries are dangerous - extremely addictive!!! I was full but couldn't stop eating them.
They lost a star because of the portion size and lack of interaction with the staff.
I'll be back though"}
{"text":"I just need to reiterate, having been this week, that this is possibly the best BBQ in the city. It's a close compete with Triple Crown but it's so different and far away  there's no need to fight. The burnt ends poutine is one of my all time favourite things, and the fact that I'm currently eating the leftovers for breakfast should confirm that diagnosis. 

They also have Creemore springs on tap, and a few local bottled beers. The ribs and chicken wings and hot sauce are all exceptional, dry and vinagery and moist like crazy and the room is chill, not trying to be anything but still good looking and there are a few picnic tables outside to enjoy the thrum of life happening on Wellington."}
{"text":"Well worth the 20min trek out of downtown and Verdun/Wellington Street here is a very interesting neighbourhood by the river We went early and had the pulled pork and rib plates with a side of brisket. They have earned  those trophies in the window trust me. The pork and the ribs were great although I do prefer the meat on the ribs to fall off just by me looking at them (my laziness). The sauces were very flavourful and spicy means \"spicy\". The slaw was wonderful. Brisket had a great smoke ring, and was cut on the thicker side (my preference) but was a tad dry. Service was very friendly, crowd was very mixed, prices not cheap....next time,  burnt-ends poutine!"}
{"text":"The service wasn't as quick as I would have expected, and I could have used a little more meat on my poutine for the $13.80 price tag. Their beer was overpriced and they fact that thy use 14 oz cups mean that you're actually only getting 12 oz of beer since they had a heavy helping of foam. Don't get me wrong, the poutine itself tasted pretty good, and the sweet sauce really helped it reach a certain level of tasty, but I lose my appetite a bit after I pull the second hair out of my food. The first hair, I can deal with. Accidents happen and we lose hair off our heads all the time, but two in a single half of my take out congainer? Not cool."}
{"text":"So I finally gave this place a try and I have to admit it was quite a disappointment.  We decided to have lunch there. 

Though I was going to try the pulled pork sandwich, I was warned it was not great. The only thing that was recommended to me was the chicken. This is the worst chicken I've ever had. It was so bad, I only had a drumstick and a few bites from the thigh. That`s not even a quarter of a chicken. It was incredibly dry...and that`s the dark meat, which is supposed to be the juicy part of the chicken. 

On top of that, I walked in not knowing what kind of service to expect so left the usual amount of tip I would at another place...the only problem was everything was self served.  The only thing I didn't have to do was cook my meal.

I don`t know what went wrong because based on other reviews, this place is supposed to be great. I may be a bit confused by the word BBQ because I was thinking I'd get something as though it was off a BBQ, but it tasted very much like deep fried chicken.  I would much rather go to Braseiro for my chicken. 

I'm glad I did try something different, but I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Excellent place to go. Friendly environment and delicious. If you are into poutine, make sure to try the brisket poutine. But if you are a group of 4, take \"le gros\", it has a bit of everything"}
{"text":"A nice find after a long sunny day at the Canadian Grand Prix.  Low keyed place with some roadside seating for alfresco chowing down. We shared a mixed platter for 2 included were ribs (excellent) sausages (good - not spicy enuf for my taste) and brisket (great). Had a side of haricots vertes which were nicely cooked and voluminous. Good choice of beers and price wasn't too painful - especially since my buddy bought. All in all a nice culinary surprise in Montréal"}
{"text":"Belle découverte! Je n'avais pas remarqué ce resto, qui est pourtant dans mon cartier. Le carnassier en moi a vraiment apprécié les côtes levées. Les frites étaient parfaites, pour ne pas dire, exquises.  Les quantités étaient parfaites. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de tables. Donc, attendez-vous à prendre place au comptoir. Fait très apprécié, vous pouvez passer prendre votre repas pour apporter."}
{"text":"The food was sadly so disappointing. I went there since my friend recommended the food saying it's absolutely delicious and greasy wet food. I was so much looking forward to it but reality proved otherwise. The food was dry, had a boring taste and was not really what I expected from a place that has that many trophies. Wouldn't try it again, too bad."}
{"text":"I would only recommend this place for take out. The venue is horrible, it's so small. 

Francois at the cash was really cool. I paid with my card and the machine forces you to leave a tip. I don't think that is acceptable seeing as all he does is take your order from a cash register, you have to get your own drink from the fridge, you seat yourself (if you actually choose to sit there) or you take your stuff with you as you leave Don't see why I tip is needed. Pay cash, don't pay with your plastic is my advice. 

I ordered the ribs with fries, they were pretty good. No complaints. Wouldn't go back unless I want take out. If you want ribs there are plenty of better options in Montreal unless you are limited to Verdun. 

Don't even bother getting beer here unless you want overpriced crappy locally brewed beer. 7-8$ a beer? You can get Guinness, Stella, Carlsberg, etc anywhere else for that price or cheaper and someone actually hands it to you."}
{"text":"Blackstrap BBQ is a wonderful establishment. The best thing about it is its unpretentiousness, nothing fancy, just some really good barbecued food. The second best thing are their ribs, so yummy.  What I also like is the coleslaw, the deep fried mac n cheese, the french fries are perfect. The brisket was good, but needed some addition of BBQ sauce to bring out flavours. But the best is yet to come, quality fries and the brisket are important ingredients to make good poutine and their burnt ends poutine is excellent.  

Love their small patio during the summer, just two picnic tables you may need to share with other customers, the always smiling staff from behind the cashier will bring your food, while you sip your beer. Their drink options are well picked and include Bierbrier's bottled brew. The Joe Beef Special Pils is available and is actually perfect choice for meaty meal.  Solid five stars on my special six star scale."}
{"text":"Montrealers are used to sloppy saucy BBQ, think of Scores, Baton Rouge, Bar-B-Barns and the undisputed king of Montreal BBQ, Le Boucan. Everything is steeped in sauce and something gets lost.

But there are many states in the US that are known for smoked BBQ and they all have their approaches. Sauce, dry, tangy, vinegary, sweet, cidery. 

Blackstrap BBQ goes dry... don't stop reading please.

The beauty of dry is that the flavour never gets buried under sauce. You get to experience the flavour in their rub, taste the porc or beef. DRY IS GOOD.

Plus they gots sauce, a spicy one and a sweet one, where you can control your saucing.

They have the classics. Ribs, Pulled Pork, Brisket, Collard Greens, Slaw, Beans and some other more modern BBQ goodies. I can't properly identify what's in their rub yet but it is tasty beyond measure. The bark is creates on the meat, whether it's the ribs, the pulled pork or the brisket is like pure candy. The ribs are meaty, tasty and NOT fall off the bone. Yes, yes I know, but having more chew to it is better. The taste is pure pork goodness. Combined with the rub bark... makes you want to believe in gods. Same for the beef brisket, which has a thick layer of fat that after the smoking progress simply melts in your mouth along with the crumbling meat, without overwhelming you with fatty taste and it is seriously one of the best brisket I've had.

The pulled pork disappointed me a little - perhaps it's the batch - and seemed to be lacking the fat that makes pulled pork so freakishly delicious. The whole point of using the Boston butt is because of the flavour and the fat. The pulled pork I had was on the dry side, not sauce-less-dry, but dry of fat. Hopefully it was just the batch.

The beans, also a disappointment, but I'll blame my finickiness about beans on that. The smoke was overwhelming and the beans rather firm, the dreaded bean-bullets. I prefer slow cooked to perfection beans and by slow cooked I mean about 8 hours of cooking. Their fries are really good, surprisingly since American style French-fries are usually dry, crispy bits of tasteless potato disaster. But they have found a tasty middle ground here. The cole slaw is unpalatable, much to much vinegar or cider in the dressing and despite my adoration of cole slaw I can easily overlook that because of the following...

DEEP

FRIED

MAC

N'

CHEESE

Seriously, I could rave about their smoked meats, but the deep fried Mac n' Cheese is insanely delicious. I expected some Mac n' Cheese because, it's the southern side of choice. But to have little balls of Mac n' Cheese battered and fried, is pure heaven. Pinch of salt, melted cheese in the middle... crazy stuff, crazy stuff.

The decor, the good service, the proximity to my home, all make for BBQ goodness and joy. Only 2 tables, the rest if the seating are stools to a bar. The open kitchen allows you to grok at the food being prepared and talk with the cooks/owners. They have take-out also. I suspect that once the work out the kinks, things will only get better. I sincerely hope the restaurant is popular with Verdunites because I want it to stay open for a long time which at the same time is a bad thing... I'm gonna eat there to often."}
{"text":"If you're in to ribs and are in Montreal, you need to make the trip down to Verdun to get some of Blackstrap.

The burnt bits poutine is fantastic, and has catapulted it's way in to my list of top poutines in Montreal. It's made with the crispy bits of the beef brisket (aka. the best bits of the beef brisket), a good solid gravy, and fresh curds.

I got the half-rack ribs plate (comes with coleslaw and a side) and the dry-rub on the ribs is amazing. They have a sweet and a spicy rib sauce to put on, but I didn't even need it - they dry-rub is that good. I want to say it's the best dry-rub I've ever had, but then my girlfriend might get angry.

For my side I had the mac & cheese, and while I'm normally not a fan (probably because I'm not from North America) these were good. They are my favourite re-interpretation of mach & cheese I've tried so far.

There's not much seating available, but the place is well designed, clean, and the service was very friendly. You can call in your order and then swing by to pick it up."}
{"text":"Ordered Le gros. Food was excellent. Ribs and brisket stood out. Don't underestimate the chicken. Fries were perfect.
Pulled pork and beans were good but I wouldn't go out of my way for either.

Next time? Brisket sandwich with a half-rack.

Those may have been the best side ribs I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"I tried out this place a couple of weeks ago with my girlfriend. We went there early, because I had read that they sell out early. Everything was still available when we arrived, and the girl taking our order was very friendly. I got the smoked turkey sandwich, and my girlfriend got the brisket. We split sides of the deep fried macaroni and the beans. The sides were pretty good, the macaroni portion was huge and it's presentation was really cool - perfectly square macaroni squares.

I really wanted to like this place. The atmosphere and the decor is great. But the BBQ is lacking. It really doesn't compare to BBQ I've tried in the States. The brisket was somewhat dry and just wasn't that great. Smoque in Chicago absolutely blew this place out of the water. If you absolutely want to try some BBQ, by all means, give this place a try. But make sure you try some real BBQ next time you're in the states. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"4.8 stars 
VIBE 
The .2 knock is for seating. I wish there was more seating though they do well for the space that they have. I'm lucky there was no line. Great staff - knowledgeable, friendly, put up with my million questions about the menu. 

WE ATE 
We ate...SO MUCH. Not that I need to mention the burnt ends poutine because that's what you should be getting. But I know, you also want the ribs or chicken (like I did) so what you can do is get the burnt ends poutine for an extra $8 on the side instead of a $3 side order of poutine. I think it was because I asked nicely. That said, I do feel they should change this in their ordering system as it may be a popular choice. Anyways, it's ultimate poutine heaven. It's possibly the best poutine I've had. 

The ribs are meaty and juicy. They're ribs! I wish there was a side sauce but there isn't. I loved the fried mac n cheese too - I could eat oodles of that. 

My friend said the chicken was really good but it wasn't \"amazing.\" But good.

I'd probably get the chili next time. It was mega good and meaty. 

Having the nutty tasting Goldings beer washed down the ribs and poutine perfectly. 

It gets pricey though - ribs, burnt ends poutine, coke and beer was $34. Worth it? Yes! I didn't really have to eat dinner and I had breakfast. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Strap on your fat pants because you're in for a ride. Extra elastic needed. 
PS Verdun is not that far or doesn't feel like it to me. BSBBQ is very accessible to the metro."}
{"text":"Endroit très sympathique avec un personnel adorable. Les prix sont un peu élevé mais la nourriture est vraiment de qualité. Je recommande leur Poutine burnt ends."}
{"text":"As a relocated Texan who moved to Verdun last year, let me just tell you that this is more legit BBQ than many places in my home state. First of all, the staff is awesome. They are friendly and look like they are having fun and joking around. One guy always remembers me and my boyfriends name! I'm a pulled pork kinda gal, and their pork is to die for. Correction, their sweet sauce is to die for!!! I load up on the stuff and use it as dip for my fries, which are usually fried and salted to perfection. I get the pulled pork sandwich, which includes slaw and pickles. It's seriously so delicious and the meat is so tender. While waiting for my order, I like to sit up at the bar and watch the cooks preparing meals. Seeing all the meats and sides being put together makes my mouth water every time. I want to try the ribs and the turkey, but I just can't give up my pulled pork.

Even though I don't live in Verdun anymore, every time I visit my boyfriend there, we make it a point to go to Black Strap."}
{"text":"After constantly hearing about Blackstrap BBQ this place has been a Yelp bookmark of mine for months now. Sadly it's located in Verdun and only a special occasion would bring me to this part of town... as luck would have it a small community Yelp event brought close to a dozen Yelpers to this place during happy hour. I just couldn't say no to this.

The first thing I noticed is that it's pretty much a hole in a wall, you can easily walk RIGHT by without even noticing it. Parking in this area is also ridiculously difficult as the area houses countless duplexes that has locals taking up all the parking spots leaving you to take the paid parking spots... which haven't been modernized in any shape or form. It's 2014 folks, I've been paying my parking spots all over Montreal for the last decade from an mobile app or parking machine that accepts credit cards... why is this place still accepting coins? Ridiculous!

I ordered their reputed burnt ends poutine and some root beer. The service was about an average wait but they were kind enough to bring me my food while I was sitting outside on their terrace with fellow Yelpers while I nursed my root beer. :)

Sadly, I wasn't a fan of their poutine. While the metal encased portion was generous and it was definitely heavy... I couldn't finish it for multiple reasons. 

Kindly note, that I feel I might be the oddball here but I felt the fries weren't up to par to what I've had for places hyped such as this place. The cheese was somewhat skimped on and the gravy sauce... which should hold everything together... was weak. The brisket meat was good though. They do offer you some BBQ sauce bottles to spice up their poutine such as a sweet or spicy sauce container but I honestly feel if you NEED to do this, your poutine isn't really what it should be. Fries, cheese curds, gravy. Maybe some extra condiments to your liking... that's what it should be. Sweet or spicy sauce shouldn't be added. But that's just me. However, the sweet sauce made the mediocre poutine actually more edible. So Hooray?

The price tag is somewhat expensive for poutine. I know there's a sort of gastronomic feeling to have that meat in your poutine, I still felt this poutine was far more expensive than it should be. 

I'm sure from other reviews they have other quality things one can order but I haven't had the chance and thus my reviews is solely for the poutine and thus, it's pretty forgettable amongst stiff competition in Montreal and while other Yelpers beside me were dealing with hairs found in their portion of poutine or the extremely fatty cuts of brisket, I guess this place simply isn't for me."}
{"text":"Soooo we've been wanting to try it for quite a while, but everytime we went it was either full (I mean, outside line-up full) or they did not have any brisket, beef nor turkey left (which leaves us with... not much). So we finally went, and it was good, but just OK good. The burnt ends poutine was tasty although a little bit too salty for me, and my boyfriend has the smoked turkey sandwich - which clearly should not be your #1choice if you do go, aim for the brisket if there's some left! I think it's a fun place to try, probably more fun during fall and winter when you need a bit of comfort. From what I remember I found the bill to be a little to high for what we did get."}
{"text":"Verdun ne cesse de me surprendre.

Je suis nouvellement abonné à la bonne viande de Blackstrap BBQ et quel plaisir ! La bouffe est toujours excellente. Je suis une personne du type ''Take Out''. Souvent je doit manger à la maison pour marier travail et maison et le tout est beaucoup plus simple lorsque qu'on mange un de leur délicieur sandwich de porc effiloché. 

La plus belle découverte est l'accompagnement des boules de macaronis aux fromages frites. My God. 

C'est à essayer !!!"}
{"text":"Verdun is becoming a hot spot for good restaurants, cafes, etc.  Admittedly it's only recently that I've started to discover this neighbourhood but the more I go there the more I discover new and amazing places.  Blackstrap BBQ was the latest of these discoveries.

I only ordered the burnt ends poutine and it's probably a good thing because I was still feeling full well into the next day.  It is a little expensive but they don't skimp on any of the ingredients.  There were sizeable chunks of beef brisket, lots of curds and they heaped on the gravy.   For me a good poutine always has lots of curds so that scored big points in my books.  The brisket itself was so juicy and tender.  I did find the whole combo slightly too salty (even for poutine) but it was still really good.  

Service was a little on the slow side for my liking.  I'd probably be convinced to give this place another chance.  I think though I would opt to try some of their other offerings the next time though."}
{"text":"ITS BBQ TIME, un bbq typiquement américain, ambiance est au fast food mais c'est joli ça sent tellement bon. Le pull pork à conseiller. 8.5/10"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Blackstap BBQ. The burnt ends poutine is to die for. I would eat nothing but that all day. It's a great place to grab a poutine and a beer. The pork sandwich is really great too, but really whatever you do, get the poutine."}
{"text":"For a place that showcase their trophies from the front window, I'm a bit underwhelmed. I've heard many good things about Blackstrap but I left dissapointed. Perhaps I was expecting too much? 

The service wasn't anything out of the ordinary - simple and straightforward. Unfortunately, the same goes for the food. The meats lean towards the dry side which is the opposite of what I want in BBQ. I wanted to try the ribs but they weren't available while I was there. The evening hasn't arrived yet but they're already out of ribs? The sides of fried mac n cheese was something I was looking forward to but what I got were deep fried balls of bland macaroni. Not really my ideal side dish. 

Sorry to say this but I'm not really impressed with the quality of the food. It's not bad but I've had better. Maybe I shouldn't expect too much from a place next time."}
{"text":"My wife and I checked this place out on Valentine's Day. Real romantic, I know.

I'm a Salt Lake City native, and while our BBQ scene is young, it's really grown fast, but having spent ~3 years in Quebec, I've tried just about every poutine around.

That said, the burnt ends poutine was just amazing. I tried the pulled pork, it was great. The sauces are vinegar-based, which is different for me, but I think that's more of a \"Memphis-style\" thing? I'm used to a tomato-based sauce. Still, they were amazing.

We will definitely be back. A lot."}
{"text":"There isn't much seating in this place. Couple of picnic tables and 5-6 bar stools. In the warmer months there is a terrace which makes it better. The quality of the food is amazing and the price is quite reasonable for the portion and quality. I've had the pulled pork sandwich and simply quite amazing especially with the BBQ sauce. I like the variety in the sides that you an get."}
{"text":"i don't know what all the buzz is about because this place did not impress me one bit! I ordered delivery, the meal \"le gros\" to share with my boyfriend which included ribs, brisket, pork, chicken, fried mac and cheese, greens, bbq beans, fries and coleslaw. Thought to try a bit of everything and let me tell you the name says it all! it was gross! the only thing that tasted good was the fried mac and cheese. the ribs were so dry it was like eating jerky, the brisket was dry and tasteless and the fried chicken(thought it would be bbq chicken) was extra greasy. Not to mention the collard greens, yuck! It tasted so bitter and burnt like it was sitting there heating since the day before. The bbq beans were just disgusting, it looked like animal droppings and tasted the same way! Over all disappointed and a big waste of 50$"}
{"text":"We had the meat trio, the best part of it was the brisket. 
I suggest full on beef brisket. 
That is all."}
{"text":"Burnt ends poutine is a must try. If you arent sure what to get , get the \"  le gros\" comes with a little bit of everything and is so worth it.  My only complaint is its been quite a few times we call for delivery and no one answered... we have been coming since they opened and will continue!"}
{"text":"Southern BBQ has finally come to Verdun!

While Black Strap sits on the same digs as the recently-vacated-and-still-mourned Casa Manolo, the ambiance is completely different. First off, it's extremely informal, the way BBQ should be, with rolls of brown towel paper on each table, service is very friendly and casual. The two large tables up front look like gigantic picnic tables.

Then there is the food! OMG Reader! This is probably one of the few places in Montreal that finally has gotten American  Southern BBQ right and done the right way. No disgusting drippy sauces and coating of brown sugar like Bar B Barn. No half-assed attempt at \"faux\" BBQ like Bofinger. The got the smoking, the got the rub, they got it all right. Prices are also very reasonable and the place has a virtual line up almost every night. (Please for the love of God, stay in Verdun!).

They literally just opened up a few weeks back so I'm guessing there may be new additions to their menu, because for the moment there are no desserts. If they do it, do it all the way! Bring on the Shoofly Pie, Sweet Potato Pie, Red Velvet Cake, Hummingbird Cake, Peach Cobbler, sun brewed iced tea and Mint Juleps!"}
{"text":"Wanted to come here for a long time. Heard so much good reviews .have an opportunity today. very disappointed I'm sorry to say. We had la gros mixed of everything. I don't like to write negative reviews. But in this case I have to. First off the brisket was so dry. The ribs were so so. The coleslaw was the worst I've ever had. But the chicken I really enjoyed. The macaroni balls was good but they only gave us two I wish they give us more. The pulled pork was okay. I heard so much hype about this place I hope it's not one of those scenarios where they start off strong and just got lazy. But like I said I don't like writing negative reviews. I will give this place another try. Only because the staff was nice and friendly. But the food was not what I was hoping for. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Mason- Dixon.

  Montreal has been hit by southern BBQ like a red headed step-child but only until Blackstap BBQ opened it's doors, was it being done right. You want authentic, they even run out of meat, like, you know, authentic BBQ joints.

  Low and slow, seasoned to perfection and with a mouth watering, smokey smell. To boot, they even sell beer now. There is nothing bad on that menu. I am, however partial to the pork the brisket and the chili.

  Last but not least, the burnt end poutine. A perfect  combination of 'the south' meets 'La Belle Province'. I hear by nominate it for 'best poutine en ville'

Waka Waka"}
{"text":"I eat vegetarian about 95% of the time, but when I feel like eating some flesh I have the turkey sandwich from Blackstrap. Super delicious and soooo flavorful. The braised greens and fried macaroni and cheese balls are really good, too! I know it's a BBQ place, and their whole concept is meat, BUT I would really, really, really love if they threw in a couple main vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Du porc, du porc et encore du porc! C'est vrai qu'il y a d'autres viandes aussi (poulet, dinde et brisket) mais si vous y allez et vous ne prenez pas de porc, vous allez manquer de quoi. Pour ma première visite j'ai gouté au sandwich de porc effiloché, la poutine \"burnt ends\", les côtes levées de porc et le clou du repas, les boules frites de macaroni au fromage. Om nom nom. J'en prendrais bien un bol de ces boules fromagées et décadentes! Les prix sont corrects pour ce que vous aurez, mais pour tout ce qu'on a pris, ca quand même monte à un total de 40$. Pour ce prix la, vous pouvez aussi commander \"le gros\" qui vous en bouchera tout un coin! C'est probablement mieux de le partager avec au moins une autre personne!"}
{"text":"Almost...so close...just about.

Blackstrap was thisclose to getting five stars from me, all but for an extra pinch of salt.

On the recommendation of several Montreal Yelpers (wise, hip and above average in looks, the whole lot of them), I journeyed to the somewhat depressing area of Verdun to seek out this \"burnt ends\" poutine I'd heard about.  Walking from the subway, the neighborhood seemed a little shabby and down at the heels but the folks on the street seemed to be full of life so I figured I was in for a treat.

And boy was I!  Walking into Blackstrap, the smell of BBQ meat is strong.  My mouth watered as I waited to place my order.  After ordering, I sat on a stool and watched the masters behind the counter prepare the orders.   As I was watching the guy prepare what turned out to be my order, I saw him add some salt and then toss the frites.  He then almost started to put the rest of the stuff on, but decided to add another pinch of salt.  

I thought nothing of it and when he called my name, the glistening tray of fries, curds, gravy and burnt ends looked divine.  It was a nice night so I sat at a table on the sidewalk and enjoyed the envious glances of passerby as they looked longingly at my poutine.

In short, it was delicious.  I mean- oh my gosh, this is so good- delicious.  About half way through eating it, the salt really started to add up.  Now, I'm pro-salt but it started to overpower the gravy and I can't help but think if he hadn't thrown that extra toss of salt in, this would have been perfection in a steel dish.

But that's a minor nitpick on my part.  The poutine was amazing and it was my second favorite I had during my Montreal poutine crawl."}
{"text":"Been here 4-5 times and the ribs are always dry and undercooked. The meat stuck so much to the bones I had to tear it off with quite a lot of perpendicular force.

The half chicken portion is generous and has the best value for the price. It's smokey and quite tender. But the chicken skin is too dry. It's not 'bite through'.

The brisket has a nice smoke ring and is tender. The burnt ends were a bit chewy though.

The pulled pork is nice with the sweet sauce, but I prefer a fruity sauce over a molasses-brown-sugar sauce.

The fried mac n cheese is my favorite side, mainly because it's fried to perfection and didn't taste too much like imitation cheese.

The average quality of the BBQ is probably worth 3.5/5, considering every item on the menu, mostly due to the dry-as-f*ck ribs.

I want to see the BBQ scene grow in Montreal so I'll support this with a 4/5."}
{"text":"This is dining at its most primitive, definitely not for anyone who cares about how the food they eat is prepared and whether or not it is healthful, but I was eating out with others including someone whose interest had been piqued by the supposed authentic southern fare. With the exception of the chicken, which on this occasion was very good, everything was disappointing, some of it very much so. No one in our party of four found it lived up to the reviews. I'd recommend going elsewhere, but if you simply must try this place you might consider buying some of the chicken--or other meat which might be okay next time since it appears to be a bit of a crap shoot--and taking it home to have with some good, healthful vegetable dishes. Any you choose to make are bound to be better than what you get at Blackstrap BBQ."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of BBQ. Pretty much everyone who knows me will agree with that. Southern style BBQ is not something we are known for here in Montreal but that is starting to evolve. We have recently been spoiled with the additions of Dinette Triple Crown and Diablos BBQ to the local scene. There is now a new contender for the crown which, given they won the Quebec BBQ competition this past summer, may be a mute point.

Blackstrap BBQ just opened this past week in Verdun amongst much fanfare in the local food scene. Started up by the former owners of Grifintown Cafe, they are focused on Memphis style BBQ and based on all the pictures and quick reviews I was seeing online, I knew I couldn't wait long before going to try it out and my god was it worth it....

I went for a fairly ridiculous amount of food mostly because there was so much I wanted to try and couldn't decide. First off, I went for a pulled pork sandwich, some brisket and the most tempted side they had, fried Mac 'n cheese balls. Yeah.... you read that right. Fried Mac 'n cheese balls. There was nothing on this plate that wasn't amazing. The pulled pork and brisket had great natural smoky flavor and that was before you added your choice of sweet or spicy BBQ sauce. The fried balls were outstanding. Soft and melty interior with a great crispy exterior. I could a bunch of those as a meal.

I would have been satisfied with that alone but the special item written on the wall got my attention : burnt ends poutine. Oh baby.... that poutine. Words do not properly describe how great this was. The burnt ends on their own were perfect but you add to that a very good poutine especially the gravy which clearly wasn't an afterthought and you have a amazing dish which made the experience that much better.

Verdun may be a little out of the way for some of you but I cannot recommend you check this place out more. As soon as I left, I waited to come back the next day. A sign of the quality and the word of mouth for this restaurant: they ran out of all their meats about an hour after we arrived.... almost 2 hours before their closing time. This was a great experience and one you shouldn't miss out on.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! I have tried pretty much all of their sandwiches and loved them all, especially the turkey one. Their sweet bbq sauce is absolutely delicious and goes with literally every variety of meat they have. Their poutine, fries and fried mac and cheese are all perfect as well. Would recommend this place time and time again."}
{"text":"Pretty satisfied with my Uber Eats order from this place. Ordered two items: (1) the brisket meal and (2) the pulled pork sandwich with fried macaroni and cheese balls. My daughter enjoyed (2) - she especially liked the fried macaroni and cheese balls. One quibble: the sandwich didn't come with the specified \"fixings\" from the order. I also like my order. Intially, I thought the quantity of food was skimpy in (1): a mini bun instead of a normal size bun and a pretty small portion of chili. But the amount turns out perfect - everything in the meal was quite filing so larger portions would have been excessive. The brisket was the best BBQ brisket I've tried in Montreal (not to be confused with Montreal style smoked meat brisket - which I prefer) and the chili - though a bit too mild - was excellent (all meat, no beans). Overall, no serious complaints. Will re-order in the future."}
{"text":"awesome BBQ smokehouse. Everything they sell is good. only downside is its tiny, so take your food to go."}
