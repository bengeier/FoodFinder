{"text":"Best Italian food I've ever had so far. Delicious meat ravioli. Lamb chops and pesto spaghetti was amazing as well. They have a good wine selection too."}
{"text":"I love finding places that give value!

L'Usine de Saghetti's got the right mix, so here are your 1, 2, 3s

Atmosphere: Warm! The entire place is draped in wood - floors, walls, tables, chairs... it feels like they've carved out the place from inside of a massive tree.  Small(isn) yet disruptively well spaced L'Usine is a great place to be on an intimate date or with a group of friends.

Food: This is where the place comes up trumps - a great selection of freshly made pastas served with a basket of fresh bread and an open bar salad.  What's nice is that of the dishes I tried none where over-bearing or overly heavy, which leaves you with the opportunity to really savour the meal at hand.  Le Golden Square mile was my favourite choice - extremely well done.   Last, L'Usine has a great selection of wines - some of which are 'importation privée (ip) i.e. they have been exclusively procured for the L'Usine.  Points!  Prices range from $14-$18 per dish, and little more for the fancier varieties (with meats an such) - like I said, value!

Service: the service here is good - nothing overly fancy, in fact the waitresses are quite casual about their work.  Not to say that they are slack or uninterested, but they are efficient and hardly noticeable otherwise.  Bring some of your A French game when you come - some waitress' communicate best in French here. mais ce n'est pas un problème - juste une autre occasion de pracitice la langue de Molière!

Super great place to pop in for a date or gathering.  Will certainly be coming back.

Eat well you all!"}
{"text":"5 stars because my lamb shank fettuccine made me cry, so good! Lovell restaurant and lovely staff. And generous with bread, came with home made herb butter. Tres bon!"}
{"text":"Great food...
Loved the lamb shank fetticuine with red wine reduction.... Wow it was so good ...five star to finger licking lamb shank"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Even though wine is very good. Wide selection at a fair price. I was expecting an amazing meal but did not happen. Quickly the place got packed so service got compromised. Salad bar is complementary, lack of choices or quality. I ordered the Chicken parmigiana. You can taste the home tomato sauce being a normal grocery store/ragu brand style like. Also ordered a traditional meat sauce spaghetti (same thing). Not real cheeses either. Tiramisu(just fine) and the half ltr. Masi Red( Lovely!) We dined two for over$80+ tip. Only thing I loved was espresso. 

Overall not such a good pasta experience. 

Not keen to go back."}
{"text":"Horendous Service! !!  We sat in the restaurant at our table for over 40 minutes waiting to place our order. Despite asking numerous times if she could take our order,  she chose to clean the empty tables instead. Once we realized that we wouldn't be getting service anytime soon,  we politely told her that we will be leaving and even left some money for the bread we ate, at the bare minimum I was expecting an excuse or even an apology  but all we got was an \"okay\"  its ashame because the atmosphere seems nice and full of rich history"}
{"text":"Really enjoyable Italian dishes in a great setting in Old Montreal.  The prices were reasonable for the food as well as the wine.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"What to say about this place! The pasta menu is very big, the wine selection as well. Prices a reasonable the old port.
The decoration is beautiful and the ambiance is warm, except a bit loud.

I took the \"monsieur le maire drapeau\" which consisted of tortellinis stuffed with ricotta cheese in a rosé sauce topped with melted mozzarella. The meal itself was very good. Sauce was very tasteful.  You get all you can eat small salad bar and fresh bread.
The garlic butter was AMAZING. I was filled with pasta and i still ate some bread with it.

Service was ok. She took my bread plate when i wasn't done.

Overall delicious experience."}
{"text":"We were starving after walking old Montreal for hours under the freezing weather so we really wanted to sit down and eat! This place was perfect because they have the all you can eat salads and bread while we wait for the main course...My pesto pasta wasn't the best but it was ok."}
{"text":"Wandered in Old Montreal and ended up here by chance.  Meat was fatty and spaghetti overcooked."}
{"text":"This is a go to spot for us in Montreal.  The value for what you get is unbeatable.  Escargots were excellent, chicken parm is very well done with light breading and lots of fresh tomato and basil.  Tomato sauce is awesome.  Perfect place for a nice dinner at prices that are cheaper than East Side Marios with actual quality food!"}
{"text":"I never clean my plate but here I did ! Wonderful atmosphere, delicious food, not overly expensive. Salad 'bar' was a nice & unexpected touch. Perfect dinner in Old Montreal"}
{"text":"Bonnes pâtes dans un décor rustique et chaleureux. Les portions sont bien généreuses. Le bar à salades et soupe est toujours intéressant et bien garni. Le service est excellent chaque fois. Les desserts, si vous avez assez faim pour en prendre, sont à se jeter par terre."}
{"text":"Le cadre est agréable (love la cave à vin). Le dejeuner comprend un accès au bar à salades (variées et tasty) et du pain/beurre à l'ail. Les pâtes sont en revanche décevantes. Cuisson limite et sauces trop riches."}
{"text":"The place was nice and comfortable, prices were very reasonable. Unfortunately, I found the lasagna was pretty terrible. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"Spaghetti st-Paul was a simple and well executed dish. Nice selection of beers, service was friendly. Oh and it's open in-between the hours of 230pm and 5pm unlike other places."}
{"text":"Décor historique, bonne nourriture, prix abordable. Le Problème est toujours le même: le service. Ça fait 4 ans que je connais l'endroit et rien n'a changé."}
{"text":"Not so good.  My family and I were very excited to eat here.  However,  the service was less than average and so was the food.  My son who only eats alfredo sauce had to get the gigantic adult portion because they were not flexible enough to make a kid's portion.  I offered to pay the normal upcharge, but ended paying $22 for the 10 bites he nibbled on because they added scallions on top, which I clearly stated in both French and English, no spices.  My chicken parm was dry like the desert and I am still suffering from heart burn a day later from the sauce.  My daughter ate one bite of her spaghetti with meat sauce.  My husband did like his steak, although we all ate some so he left hungry.  We did not bother with dessert, as it is stored on these low to floor case. Kinda yucky way to present desserts.  Oh, by the way,  the salad bar sucks - to be blunt.  Did not take one item.  Waste of $$$$"}
{"text":"We had to wait 25 minutes in line for a table, it was worth it.
Ambient lighting, an excellent all you can eat salad bar.
They have a nice wine bottle list.
Devine lamb shank braised in red wine that just fell apart and the fettuccine was to die for, nice seasoning and doneness. 
I will come again."}
{"text":"I want to give three and a half stars. Food was okay nice salad bar wonderful service. Comfortable very cute place for a family meal in old Montreal . The sauce had a spicy tang to it that I didn't like. Bathrooms were an adventure couldn't fit in one stall and I'm not big, other stall the toilet moved when you sat on it."}
{"text":"Solid experience, perfect meal before continuing our trek through the brisk air back to our hotel. The place has a warm vibe, with a good balance of local flair and welcoming ambiance. The food was all good, with only minor improvements that could be made. 
All the entrées come with unlimited salad bar and bread. The salad bar is quite small, but it's all incredibly fresh. As for the main course, we had Le Golden Square Mile and Les Éclusiers. Bot were good, but LGSM was really good. It had the most delicious goat cheese I think I've ever had. The raviolis were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Les Éclusiers did not suck either, with a well-rounded heat to it. The shrimp were a good size, and well cooked. The flavor and freshness were fine.  
All in all, we liked the food, the portions were perfect, the service was good, and the atmosphere was lovely. We'd go again. Next time, we'd leave room for the rather handsome desserts!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and enjoy the food, but the service at this restaurant was appalling. The waitress was curt and rude and rushed us out of the restaurant. Other staff members took our plates too soon and kicked us out of the place immediately after paying our bill. I am generally an easy customer and a good tipper, but this was unacceptable as a paying patron at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Well all-spaghetti all delicious! Very warm, homey, relaxing vibe. Perfect lighting and pleasant music. Nice and polite staff. Well priced menu. I tried the Grand Prix. Liked it. Yummy and plenty. The salad bar is included. But it does not have much to offer. I would definitely order dessert but I was already full. The interesting point is that they serve daily wine. A glass of red (Spain's) went really well with the food. Spicy and dry."}
{"text":"Solid 9/10. Not best food i've had in my entire life but very enjoyable satisfying and delicious! Would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Good past overall could have stronger seasoning
Free salad bar which is actually good and we ordered a merlot bottle for 35dlls and ended up paying 80 dlls for the whole dinner which we thiught was very reasonable for what we got."}
{"text":"What a wonderful, wonderful place ! We were in Montreal for 4 nights and ended up in this place for 2 of them! The #2 and #10 items on the menu are simply phenomenal! Cant wait to go back here when we visit again!"}
{"text":"Lovely Italian restaurant in Vieux Montreal, different and yummy salad bar, good rolls and average pasta dishes. Meatballs disappointing but still a decent value for Montreal. Efficient service by Fanny who was charming and dressed for Halloween. Wine was average but there are no deals on wine in Canada. Overall a lovely fall evening for us."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant along with 2 friends, who, I must mention, LOVED their meals. However, I would be lying if I said that I thought that the meal I ate was delicious, or incredibly well seasoned. I had the opportunity to taste their plate of Tortellini au Gratin, which was not bad, though comparable to what I could have prepared at home with a package of Olivieri Tortellini and some commercial sauce. And honestly, how sad is it to eat a meal in a restaurant that you could have easily prepared at home for far less expensive, and with more expertise? Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with packaged pasta - It can even be a life saver when you are short on time. The real problem with the meal that I ordered? 1 word. Overcooked. If you are going to use some commercial pasta in your kitchen, you should at least have the decency to serve it Al Dente. At least that's my take on it. 

On a brighter note, I should mention, again, that both of my friends really enjoyed their meals! I guess that this restaurant fails at pleasing some people, but succeeds at charming others."}
{"text":"So what to do for dinner in our first night in a new city...

We were in the mood for Italian while in Montreal. This restaurant was relatively close to our hotel so we decided to walk there. Unfortunately for us, the city was under an extreme cold alert, so the 20 minute walk became an exercise in survival. 

Thankfully, once we were there, we quickly forgot about the cold. We were promptly seated and the restaurant was fairly busy so we were glad to have a table right away. Place is a little quaint and has a nice European decor. It's located in the Old Montreal area. 

They bring you a complementary bread with an amazing garlic butter along with the AYCE salad bar. We quickly decided to go with the Cheese Garlic bread for an appetizer. We went with Spaghetti St-Paul (spicy tomato sauce), Rigatoni with meat sauce, smoked meat and mozzarella and Spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs.

The service was attentive and prompt as we were never out of water. 

Portions size were decent and all 3 dishes were flavourful. We were glad that we braved the weather to be here. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"Read carefully!! The food was great!! My food was awesome!! Again, Food gets 5 stars!!!! However, the service SUCKED!!
Our waitress was just not good. She tried to do nothing but upgrade us. No drink refills. After we got our food she was gone!!"}
{"text":"Found this by accident, great find in historic Montreal. We have been there twice because the wait staff is excellent, the Wine selection is excellent. 
We all found the food to be better than OK but not exceptional.
We will for sure be back for the wine and the service! Bon!"}
{"text":"Decent food and service, can't complain.  This place is American-style Italian food, both on selection and portion size.  A bit on the pricey side ($15-25 for lunch); right next to Jacques Cartier Square this is more of a tourist spot than anything else.  Overall, good food and unobjectionable for entertaining groups."}
{"text":"Very affordable spot in Old Montreal - other places nearby I found to be very over-priced. There's a great selection of pasta dishes and a delicious salad bar is also included in the price. Even the bread and garlic butter brought to the table was very tasty! I had a traditional spaghetti dish and it was very filling!"}
{"text":"There are endless options for Italian food in and around Montreal, so deciding upon a place is a bit like trying to select a beer in Munich during Octoberfest. Needless to say, this place did not disappoint! The portions were generous, the service attentive, and each entree comes with free salad bar access. I settled on a plate of spaghetti with a spicy tomato sauce (arrabiata), and it was as expertly prepared and delicious as you could get. Even better, my order only came to $11.00 (Canadian dollars) after tax. If you're in Montreal and looking for pasta, definitely give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Really beautiful place. Came here for a staff Christmas dinner in December and the decorations were stunning. The food and the service were also very good. Overall good experience and they easily accommodate big groups."}
{"text":"Took the family here on a beautiful spring evening for dinner. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. Servers were very polite, and were great with our children. 

I quote my 10-yr old: \"OMG! This is the BEST TORTELLINI EVER!!!!!!!\"

I had Les 100 Cloches, which was delicious and tender. Everyone enjoyed themselves, and we were very pleased with our choice for dinner!"}
{"text":"We wandered into this charming restaurant inside an historic building by chance.  Inside, we were greeted by a lovely young lady who was fluent in both English and French.  We were seated in a dining room featuring old stone and deeply polished wood, with golden lighting...a cozy ambiance!  Service was prompt, and our selections from the fairly extensive menu were all tasty and served fresh and piping hot.  The bread service and small salad bar were complimentary, and were also delicious.  My order of spaghetti with meat sauce was superb, while my companion's order of chicken parmigiana with marinara sauce and pasta was tender and juicy.  All prices were reasonable for a tourist area.  Overall, this was a lovely experience in an attractive restaurant."}
{"text":"Had lunch here, mid week, mid winter. No wait, not crowded, good service. Meatballs were a bit oily but the cheesy garlic bread was delicious and the spaghetti was properly cooked. Good, solid lunch spot."}
{"text":"environment is good, food is wonderful, and the price is comparable. My dad love it, will come back."}
{"text":"Eat. Here.
Eat too much here.
Eat and drink everything including the salad bar here.
I was introduced to this restaurant one blizzardy night almost 5 years ago as me and my friends sought refuge from the cold after a night of skating in old port.

It was the best winter discovery of my life.

Starting with the buns and \"ohmygodthisissogood\" homemade garlic butter (and yes you can ask for more but you will feel ashamed in your happiness), this restaurant really offers everything a pasta lover needs. The free salad bar is always stocked and always fresh. Their house vinaigrette is tangy and delicious and I put it on everything I pick from the salad bar, even if it's just the potato salad.

I have tried nearly everything on their menu but I HIGHLY recommend the \"place des armes\" spaghetti with 2 HUGE succulent meatballs. Their meat pasta sauce is the perfect balance of tangy and sweet and the pasta is ALWAYS cooked to perfection. I'm an al-dente fanatic and l'Usine de Spaghetti delivers it perfectly every time.

I have recommended this restaurant to every single person I meet who is in Montreal for the first time and every person that has eaten there has told me it was a great recommendation. The most recent people to hear me stand on a soap box and rave about this restaurant were a couple from Newfoundland I happened to overhear on a terrace (I'm originally from the East Coast) and after I had finished my -by now- very polished spiel, my boyfriend and I decided to eat there that night! And who should we see in the line up while we were leaving but the couple!

I told them I would hope they enjoy their meal, but I knew they would so I just told them to get the special of the day braised beef ravioli instead.

Besides the incredible pasta they also have a kick ass white sangria. I highly recommend and guarantee you'll become as much of an addict of this place as I am. Just can't beat dat garlic buttah!

Quality for a great price and definitely not a tourist trap, L'Usine de Spaghetti is sure to become your cozy refuge from anything in life like it was that winter day for me."}
{"text":"C'est la première fois que je mange dans ce resto....la bouffe est bonne.....le prix est un peu cher....les serveuses ne sont pas professionelle......"}
{"text":"This is an incredible deal in old Montreal. Wish we'd discovered it 2 days ago. We stopped in because it was close to our marina (traveling by boat) and it was rainy so didn't want to search. Cozy old world atmosphere. Almost immediately, were served rolls with butter that had a good amount of fresh garlic added--good. I ordered lamb shank, husband ordered arrabiata. Then we were told our meals also included an incredible salad buffet--potato, green, carrot salads, mixed greens with tangy mustard dressing, beets, green beans, and others I didn't try but all I did were tasty. Good glass of house wine only $7 Canadian. Servings were large--had leftovers. Bottom line: Food was very good, even though not amazing, but I'm giving 5 stars for value. Whole meal--including 2 hearty pasta entrees, salad bar, glass of wine, bottle of pellogrino was $55 Canadian for two--a steal."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant in the old port of Montreal. A group of us had supper there on a weekend and it wasn't packed at all. The salad bar is a plus but isn't really something special. The garlic butter that came with the bread, though, was excellent. There is a lot of choice on the menu for people with different tastes. Different meat options, vegetarian options, different pastas... something for everyone! All of us enjoyed our meal and the bonus was that the prices were extremely reasonable compared to other restaurants in the area. Not the best pasta plate I've ever had but it was still very satisfying as I finished the whole thing (i had the linguini with prosciutto and blue cheese)."}
{"text":"I give this little gem a solid 4 stars. They offer a great lunch special with a soup and salad bar included with your main. I had the braised beef ravioli that was very good. I will definitely come here again. Great cozy atmosphere, very good food and reasonable prices. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"A gem in old port Montreal. Lunch comes with a salad bar and amazing garlic butter. Mushroom penne is so good that I wonder how they cook it out of such simple ingredients. Price is reasonable for this touristy area. Service is alright but definitely great value for a yummy meal!"}
{"text":"A nice spot to have dinner at old port, reasonably priced for the location and homely meals.
The atmosphere is cozy and the service is pretty relaxed so you can enjoy yourself. Apparently this place has been around for a VERY long time, so kudos for them!

Their menu is mostly pasta based, I got the stuffed manicotti and spaghetti bolognese duo. (the entrees are all named after montreal streets or areas, mine was st.denis something) Pasta was really good, cooked just right. Nothing too fancy and just hits the spot. They have a serve yourself salad bar, with about 6 different salads. The salads weren't particularly appealing but hey, eat your veggies right? They also start you off with rolls served with garlic butter. The rolls were okay but wow that garlic butter! My boyfriend nearly finished off the whole thing. 

Worth a try if you're looking for a place to eat in old montreal. 

side story: we spoke to another diner who just exited the restaurant and took a photo of the storefront. Turns out he sailed for 4 months from the Netherlands, making stops along the shore at every city he passed. He said the lobster linguine was good!"}
{"text":"I enjoy my meal every time I go!! Pasta is delicious!! Very unique variety of entrees and dishes. Yummy!! If I'm in the old port and feeling pasta that's the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"Old Montreal. Had a delicious authentic Italian meal. I had their house specialty: pasta w/meat sauce. Daughter had one of the specials: linguini with lobster sauce. Service was very good. Came with salad bar, bread, and garlic butter. Their cheesecake was some of the finest I've had. Lemon cake was also delicious. Strong recommend for this place."}
{"text":"Malheureusement...
Linguini aux homards: sauce fait avec crème 35% et beurre...ça ne goûtait pas le homard. 
Pas (plus de morceaux) d'homards...probablement du homard en canne ou surgelée. 
Par contre, fettucini et jarret d'agneau: tjrs aussi excellent. 
Bar à salades: santé et goûteux. 
Carte des vins qui s'harmonise bien avec les plats. 
Premier bémol sur le service: une serveuse un peu trop \"loud\" et campagnarde...à la limite de l'arrogance...mais pas la nôtre, heureusement!"}
{"text":"The menu has many different options that are all unique. Next, the inside of the restaurant is very cozy and original. The service was amazing, friendly, and fast. I very much enjoyed the bread with the garlic butter. Also, the salad bar is a great concept with the best salad dressings I've had. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Très bonnes pâtes cuisinées avec des produits frais.
Le décor est sympa.
Prix corrects pour un quartier touristique."}
{"text":"Just happened upon this restaurant and from the inside looks i expected an average meal.  This place was astounding in fact! I've had Italian all over the world and this place is right up there now in my top 3 which are La Forketta in Singapore and the no longer open Gionetti's in Oakbrook Hills Chicago USA.  I could go on forever about the bread, the starters, the pasta sauce and the meatballs but you really need to experience this for yourself."}
{"text":"Our experience here was very nice.  The servers were warm and welcoming, and the sangria was excellent.  The food was very good as well!  Overall very good experience!

Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"We have had dinner here twice on our week long stay in Montreal. The lobster linguini was outstanding,as was the ravioli. Also the classic spaghetti and meatballs is zesty and yummy. Have a small slice of bread with a large helping of their special butter but be careful not to over eat. Salad bar is an eclectic blend of tastes. Be careful here too, easy to over do it with the delicious variety. I tried everything in the salad bar (small bites) but not lettuce with dressing. All was outstanding. 
Desert: if they have strawberry shortcake get it. It's not the American-traditional style it's WAY better. This cake (and it is a cake) is why we came back a second time but jeez the meals are wonderful!  I will tell everyone I know coming to Montreal to get lunch or dinner here!!!  
Wine selection was above average. I went with the suggested wine (both evenings) and it was superb with my meal. 
Enjoy!!!  By the way. The servers are super nice and helpful!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I definitely would recommend this place again. The open appetizer bar, which consists of different types of salads, was all you can eat and tempting to eat more than you should before your main entree. But make sure to save room for the entree because they are all delicious. This place was recommended to us by two strangers from Montreal and they did a good job because the pasta is super good and tasty. Everything from the presentation to licking the last bit of sauce out of the bowl was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"We just happened to pop into the restaurant while we were touring Olde Montreal.  We did it based on the menu and the crowd inside.  We were glad that we did as the food was good.  And our servers were great. Great value for the money."}
{"text":"While walking through Old Montreal with some locals, they suggested this restaurant. It definitely lived up to expectations! The menu is quite large and offers a broad range of different pastas and sauces. According to our waitress, the recipes have stayed the same for a long time, which speaks to the longevity of this restaurant in the Old Montreal area.

Upon finally deciding what I'd eat (I went with the classic spaghetti with meat sauce, as they call it, the \"Spaghetti St-Leonard\") which cost $14. All the menu prices seemed very reasonable, especially considering that all menu items come with salad bar and bread included. 

The bread comes out warm and fresh, and is served with a delicious garlic butter, made in house, as well as conventional butter. The salad bar isn't huge, but it has a good range of different salads that include leafy greens, pasta or potato salads, and other marinated salads and cut-up vegetables. The dressings are very tasty, and there is a vinaigrette that is a real stand-out. The quality of the main course was also great. The pasta was cooked just perfectly (not too hard and not too soft), and the sauce was flavourful and satisfying. The portion size was also surprisingly large, so I wouldn't think anyone would leave hungry.

As an interesting side note, the menu items are all named after places and figures from the local area, so those new to the area or just visiting can find some names to google while they wait for their meal (the menus are left behind as placemats).

Also, the decor in this place is really nice and rustic, which suits the Old Montreal charm perfectly. This place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"It was the only place I could find that was open for a 6pm dinner and it was a great option! I wondered Lamb and it was cooked perfectly. The meals included a salad bar that I wasn't expecting."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch here. Judith was our waitress and she was so warm and lovely. She made excellent recommendations. We had the spaghetti with lobster, today's special, and spaghetti with meatballs. Both were delicious! Great great meatballs (tasty, and very tender...meaty) and so much lobster! Nice wine as well. Desserts looked great but we were too full. An all you can eat salad bar is included with the main dishes. It was delicious! Meticulously prepared salads and dressings. A wonderful feature of this restaurant! We had potato salad, beet salad, pasta salad, Israeli couscous, crisp lettuce, and homemade coleslaw. I almost forgot! They have a Wonderful warm bread basket!!! With herbed butter. Lovely and very quaint decor...from the stone wine cellar in the main dining room, to the antique phone operators switchboard by the bathrooms. Eclectic and interesting! A great place anywhere...a standout in this touristy neighborhood."}
{"text":"I thought it was cool that Charles Dickens wrote some of his notes here for A Tale of Two Cities.  It's in a very touristy part of town which might be why it tends to be a little pricey.  

I thought the atmosphere was quaint and comfy.  We came in around 2:30 in the afternoon so very few people were in there.  Service was pretty good.

To start, you get free bread and garlic butter.  Then, we got free salad bar with the meal.  We did not have a ton of options at the salad bar, but they were a unique selection for someone coming from Ohio.  They also had potato salad and I always love a good potato salad.  I ordered the tortellini ($14) and my wife ordered the spaghetti ($12).  These were probably the cheapest items on the menu.  The tortellini was covered in cheese and it was exactly what I was hoping for.  Italian food is not my top choice usually so I was quite happy with what I had.  My wife really enjoyed her spaghetti especially the spicy sauce.  I thought the portions were pretty good.  After having bread, potato salad, and pasta, I was quite full and satisfied.  

My wife thought I should give this place 5 stars but the price is keeping me from going above 4 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the service was great. They were able to accommodate us last minute although we didn't had a reservation. We'll definitely visit them again when we will be back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Très bon. Assez de choix pour les vegetarien, le prix n'est pas cher. J'ai payé 16 dollars pour la pâte ( assez de fromage et assez frais) et le bar de salade gratuite!!!!! L'ambiance de ce restaurant est calme. Bonne serveuse aussi. J'ai vrm aimé ce Resto."}
{"text":"Cadre agréable, un plat de pâte délicieux accompagnée d'un bar a salade pas trop charger juste ce qu'il faut ! Je recommande la plat avec les raviolis au chèvre juste délicieux !   La qualité / prix sont très correcte, Je reviendrais c'est certains"}
{"text":"My 8 year old liked this place so much she asked to type her own review... (adults will like this place too!!!) so here you go:


I really liked this place. The waitress Chloe was so nice. The pasta was great."}
{"text":"Great food. Spaghetti St. Leonard was super delicious!! Good service. Salad bar could be better. Was very limited but it was included."}
{"text":"Overpriced bad food. Even the presentation was bad. Two stars for the ambiance and for being open on New Year's Day. Tasted like a microwave dinner- some parts of my meal were very hot and some bits were cold."}
{"text":"Wir hatten beide ein superleckeres Nudelgericht, eines mit linstet, eins mit Gambias. Dazu gab es vorweg gratis Salat und Brot. Nettes Ambiente und netter, schneller und aufmerksamer Service!"}
{"text":"Food is good, although service needs improvement. They provide all you can eat salad if you order a main course"}
{"text":"It was a bit difficult to choose from so many restaurant in that old town area. Was attracted by the decoration inside and went for the lobster spaghetti on the ad, which is Very delicious. Tasty bread and nice salad bar for free, too."}
{"text":"So, I am conflicted here as I was taken here by some co-workers of mine who live in Montreal and the service was absolutely top-notch and the place itself was very nicely appointed and comfortable.  The issue is that none of that fills my belly and being a NY who loves his Italian, I have to weight the food heavier than the rest.  The appetizers were decent with the shrimp being the best.  The duck was a little salty.  Their sauce is meaty as one reviewer pointed out but it is way too sweet and had a pasty consistency when I dined there.  This is not how sauce or \"gravy\" is supposed to taste or at least what I am accustomed to.  Again, the menu, drinks, service, and the company were all fantastic and some portions of the meal were very good.  I just had an issue with the sauce and for me this is a core component of my Italian food experience."}
{"text":"Though looking through other reviews on this place, I thought the service was pretty friendly! The only reason for the 4 star rating is the food was mostly really good, the wine was excellent, but it was just kind of the sauce that was a little lacking. Not super expensive either for being in Old Port, but beware it isn't a cheap meal either. Mostly a positive experience, only issue was I felt the waiter didn't come around enough to bring water or whatever I was in need of (the water glasses are pretty small, and dishes are usually pretty hot) but they were pleasant about it and have me a whole pitcher of water! Overall about a 9 out of 10 experience!"}
{"text":"Solo-traveling for the first time, eating alone here was actually a great experience. They give fresh bread with homemade garlic butter and there is a salad bar included with your meal. The service was very nice and accommodating as well. I ordered the Spaghetti Saint-Paul, which was just basic spaghetti with tomato sauce. They used angel hair pasta which I was super happy about because it's my favorite! The sauce was really spicy, I'm not sure why, but it still tasted good, especially if you like spicy food. At least the bread is there on the side to comfort your taste buds. For sure a quick, easy restaurant with good food with stop in on Rue Saint-Paul after a long day."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great atmosphere. It is located in a 300 year old building and has a really cool vibe. They have a large wine selection. Each meal comes with a salad and soup bar that is phenomenal. The chicken Parmesan and meatballs are great. The waitress was quick and attentive. We will definitely visit again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"We were looking for something good on a budget. It seems that most restaurants in this area are pricey so when we found this on Yelp we decided to check it out. I got the lobster linguini special and my boyfriend got the steak and spaghetti. Both dishes were so rich and flavorful. The wait staff was friendly and the salad bar was a nice plus."}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 if I could only because their garlic butter was really good! Service is quick, all you can eat salad and bread, the buns are cold and there are 5/6 salads to choose from. Pasta was mediocre, the vegetable pasta did not have enough sauce (number 7), the daisy pasta (number 1) was too heavy, they stuffed the ravioli with cheese and then put more cheese on top, probably would be better with a brown butter sauce. 

We were just desperate for food, would not come again."}

General comment: crowdy, good for kids, established since a long time, cheap for a Old Port Restaurant.

Review:

I went there with my pal and his friend on summer at a very touristic time of the year. On the marvelous St-Paul. E St. This must be one of the best deal and it as established a solid reputation. Set on 2 floors, the concept is pretty simple : Free Bread (with butter or Garlic Butter) and Salad Buffet with approx. 10-12 choices which is pretty decent. The menu has approx. 50 choices of fresh pasta. You will pay approx. 20-25$ dollars for the whole thing. When we were there it was really crowdy and we were on the second floor, near the kitchen. Normally I would be annoyed but the very same place, Charles Dickinson was there when he wrote his Christmas Novel. 

I don't think I would go back there because I'm rarely amazed by pasta restaurant. What makes me come back to a restaurant is based on: Could I do this at home without being annoyed and if the answer is: NO well i might come back. However the quality of the food is good, and the service rushed but not pushy."}
{"text":"Spent a lovely day in Old Port for Canada Day and decided to try this restaurant with family and friends. We were all very satisfied with our experience, loved the food!

I always like having a little something with my main dish and the all you can eat salad bar and bread was perfect. There are choices that'll please anyone, from your basic greens to couscous, chick peas, potato salad and so on. I got 3 plates of it and wanted more that's how much I enjoyed it.

I got their classic St Leonard spaghetti with meat sauce which was extremely flavorful and had just the right texture.
My mom got the duck leg confit with caramelized onions and raisins, she must not have realized that it would be so sweet although the duck itself was succulent.

We were 5 people and not one of us had food left on our plates by the end of the meal.

It's a charming restaurant, great location and not overly packed. The fact that it doesn't have a terrace makes it a little bit more low key compared to other restaurants in the area but I found that perfect since that means it's easier to get a table.

I would definitely go back, can't wait to try their tortellini or chicken parmesan.

I would have given this place 5 stars had it included a desert or drink in the meal."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night and enjoyed some great food. The salad bar is a nice touch while you wait for your entrée to arrive.  The service was friendly however they seemed to be a touch under staff thus the 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after a walking tour of Montreal.  I had the eggplant parmigiana special that included their salad bar and soup offering.  Both the food and service was excellent.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This will sound overblown but the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had (sorry Mom). My wife had the lasagna and was equally pleased. The bread was good but not warm, which was a bit of a disappointment. Table seating was comfortable although the table next to us was extremely loud, fortunately they left shortly after we were seated.

Service was friendly and quick. I'd definitely go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Went here on a date with my wife while on vacation. Located in Old Montreal, the restaurant isn't very large, but felt cozy, with a few other diners sitting nearby. Perfect ambiance to have great conversations with the people you're with. Food was great. Got the lamb with pesto spaghetti. Very good. They also bring out bread & butter before hand, also very good. Overall, really enjoyed my dining experience here."}
{"text":"Food atmosphere great; however waiters picked up plates and bottles with out asking .
Rushing my enjoyable meal. Rush rush"}
{"text":"what a great find in old port. tons of pasta choices to choose from and great specials. reasonable wine list. our good was great and our server was very pleasant and didn't rush us. we opted for caesar salads over the salad bar, just personal preference, I regret not even checking it out...i had the lobster linguine which was full of lobster chunks and a light cream sauce, hubby had the veal saltimbica, crisp and light not cheesy. delicious."}
{"text":"Very quaint, cozy and rustic italian restaurant.  The food was very good, the portions very good.  They have a kids menu, so is a family friendly space.  Dinner comes with a salad bar and lovely dinner rolls and fresh butter with herbs.  There is a wine room on site so plenty of choices there.  There are many choices on the menu to satisfy the italian craving in you.  The service was very good.  If your looking for a nice place to unwind and have a good italian meal, this is the space."}
{"text":"The neighborhood is so beautiful and the decor inside is really detailed. Lot's of seating and when I went it was not crazy busy. Steak & spaghetti was so good."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with great atmosphere. We are a family of 5 and the food was delicious and affordable. Staff is fantastic and very welcoming.  Plan for a meal here and you are in the heart of old Montreal. We were very happy with our choice."}
{"text":"L'usine's quaint old building is cool and interesting, comfortable but with a cramped feeling at the same time. The bar is fairly limited, with a few decent beer and wine choices, and the salad bar is good... But I wasn't all that impressed with the \"Italian\" food, particularly the tomato sauce. Also, our server was distracted and a little too pre-occupied with what I assume is her beau, who was seated at the bar

Maybe I'm spoiled with all the great Italian food I've had over the years, but my entree here was uninspired and a bit bland. 

Mama Francesca's home cooking it is not"}
{"text":"What wonderful service! It was a snowy day in the is beautiful town and we slipped in to this quaint restaurant and felt like we slipped back in time with excellent service and wonderful pastas in huge portions! To salad bar was a fun surprise and very very good with different sorts  of fresh mixed salads  The staff was so kind and attentive and we enjoyed such a delightful afternoon there as we leisurely ate our meal. Would highly recommend!"}
