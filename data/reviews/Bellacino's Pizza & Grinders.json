{"text":"Horrible to say the least! I placed an on line order and when I went to pick it up I sat at the drive thu window for 10 minutes without anyone interested in helping me. I called from my car to let them know I had been waiting and would appreciate if someone could help me! Angie who answered the phone hung up on me then swung the window open and yelled at me! Needless to say she had someone else hand me my order because I wasn't about to take her attitude! She will loose at ton of business for the already struggling Bellacinos! Bellacinos management might want to give this woman an attitude adjustment or there will be plenty more dedicated patrons like myself who won't be back!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give NEGATIVE stars! I asked my server if I could read an ingredients label because I am celiac and require gluten free foods. He came back saying he spoke to the owner and \"there are no  labels\" even though they don't make any of the food themselves.  Since I could eat nothing there and the rest of my party was ordering, I said I was just going to order a gluten free pizza from the Pizza Hut across the street.  The owner then came out and told me she would not allow it. I argued that my entire party of 8 was buying food and drinks, so we would give her plenty of business.  When I asked her why I couldn't see a label she reiterated there were none. I said, \"I am sure the health department requires you to have that information available upon request. She still refused and the questioned my celiac disease!  She was RUDE AND INTRUSIVE!  If she were any kind of business woman, she would have simply apologized for being unable to accommodate me and offered to cover the cost of my drink.  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"Took our family for our daughter's birthday over the weekend. Stick to the pizza and grinders. The chicken Alfredo was a bland cream sauce with chewy chicken that did not seem to be 100% real chicken, the Greek salad was iceberg lettuce (and not even the green leaves, all of it was the white inside layers) and the \"chicken\" was the same tasteless chewy chicken pieces /parts that was in the alfredo, more onions than anything else. The ones that ordered pizza and grinders said theirs was good. Oh well. Live and learn."}
{"text":"This is the email I just wrote to Bellacinos. Decide for yourself if the mediocre food is worth the awful service:  \"I'm writing to tell you that your restaurant's service is incredibly awful. The last time I came to pick up a to go order about a month ago, I waited at the window for almost 10 minutes trying to flag someone down inside. After honking a few times, no one came to the window. I then pulled into a parking space and came in. After waiting by the register for another 5 minutes (while seeing my food sit on the metal rack behind the counter) someone finally came. My food was cold by the time I arrived at home.   And today (10 minutes ago) - I called to make a pick-up order. I was put on hold and guess what? No one ever came back to take my order. I waited for 5 minutes and then gave up.   It is clear that the bums you hire don't care customer service, so my family will not be patronizing your restaurant again.   Also, you will be able to find the above letter on Yelp in about 10 minutes.   Have a fantastic day. \""}
{"text":"Great sliders, the chicken bacon ranch is amazing!! Pizza is pretty good, red sauce is okay. Have only been there for lunch but definitely been good every time I have been there. The staff is friendly and the food comes out quickly!"}
{"text":"Fast and tasty. It's standard American food / pizza joint - not the best pizza in the world, or the state, or the region for that matter, but for the price, it's good. Lunch service is order at the counter and then the food comes out to the table. I guess the service reflects the price - no utensils or plates came with the salad or the parmesan bread appetizers, but they came out later with the subs (\"grinders\") and pizzas. A lot of flat screen TVs adorn the place, and there is an outdoor area. A minus? Ads on the menu - a little cheesy, and not in the good way."}
{"text":"Went in and was seated at a dirty table. Silverware was also dirty. Asked sever if we could get some one to clean table and she was just like do you want to move to table behind you. I said ok and it was dirty too. Looked at a third option and that table was dirty too. Before we could say anything server was gone. She seemed to care less. I saw two other young ladies rolling silverware in front and they looked but didn't care either. Horrible service and poor cleanliness. I probably will never return if this is how your place is run."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! My family and I went to Bellacino's last month when a few of my nieces and nephews were in town for the weekend. I am pretty particular with restaurants and rarely am I \"WOWed\" with the food. We had a very nice server take our order and bring it to our table and even box up some extras and keep them warm for us, too. We ordered a variety of food and everyone seemed pleased. I ordered the \"White Pizza\" and it was, by far, the best I have ever had. It had ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, fresh tomatoes and garlic sauce and was absolutely mouth-wateringly delicious. I will DEFINITELY go back for more. :) Mmmmmm!!"}
{"text":"First, I was struck by the lack of a posted menu. You basically walk up to a counter with no signage and order your food from the take-out menu.  I ordered the Veggie Light sandwich and the 'baked' fries.  The fries seemed no different than any other - and lacked flavor.  The sandwich was decent but impossible to eat by hand. I had to use a fork for most of it.   It was a Sunday night - and it was pretty dead in there. Only one person came in to a pick up a pizza and only two other tables were occupied.   I've found much better places to eat during my stay here including Noodletasia and El Paraiso (down the street)."}
{"text":"Went here after buying a Groupon. Never have had the pizza. Sandwiches are okay. It wil probably take coupons to get me back."}
{"text":"-first time eating there. \" dead \" customer service. - food took forever and it was of bland quality. - the \" cook\" making the food was not wearing gloves. had a poor attitude. - cashier ( although nice) had a \" i'm done\" look on her face and did not give good customer service -ive been in the restaurant industry for over 10 years both fine dining & casual. i've never met such an unmotivated group of people in my life."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the area. Great beers too! Staff is always friendly. And they have a whole wheat crust! I love you Bellacinos!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. ..got to go for the grinders they are the best!! Staff is awesome and gray choices of beer"}
{"text":"Always great food. You will wait a few minutes for your grinder but not any longer than sitting in line at the McDonalds drive  thru and the food is SO much better it's worth the wait.  Grab a drink, relax and your food will come out hot and delicious."}
{"text":"We got the Friday special (one large one-topping pizza, one 18\" grinder, one order of cheesy garlic bread for $24.99) to go, and were very pleased.  It was a good value.  More than enough food for 5 people.  The food was pretty good, too.  The pizza had lots of cheese, and they sliced the meatballs to make the sub easier to eat (I've never seen that done before, but it's a pretty good idea!).    I'd say value is the best thing they've got going here.  The food was fine, but not exceptional, and the service was adequate if not exactly friendly."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite places to go ever since I was little. It was always a good amount of food for your money until recently when they raised the prices and in all honesty it's not worth going back too. It's disappointing to see places have to do that. We will be back for the car cruise in on Thursday's but we won't be staying and eating. This past Thursday we sat out on the patio for dinner and waited for someone to come take our order for 15 minutes- the waitress apologized took our order, then we waited another 20 before we saw our drinks & food and they were not very busy at all. I would suggest spending your money up the road elsewhere. Or go across the road to Pizza Hut!"}
{"text":"Absolutely our favorite pizza. All fresh ingredients . Love the crust and sause. Wish I lived closer. Grinders are great too, but end up mostly with the pizza because I just can't pass up the pizza. Very friendly service. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"I'll agree with others in saying the decor is worn out but the food is amazing and the staff is upbeat and pleasant"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've been going here since they were at their old location in Stow.  I read some of the other reviews, and since they've moved, they serve you, and you don't get your own drinks/napkins/etc.  I think the pizza and grinders are awesome, and the staff ( or at least the majority of the staff) is amazing!  I also love the drive-thru window for carryout orders as much as the great atmosphere inside.  There's not a whole lot of food I'd rate a perfect 5-star rating, but I have no complaints here for sure."}
{"text":"For a quick supper - this place is great!  I had the chicken grinder which had the expected toppings of onions, peppers and cheese (hold the tomato for me, though) - the bread was crunchy on the outside and just right on the inside - very good!  My friend ordered the Bellacino club and was equally pleased!  We were in and out quickly and both of our selections and a basket of baked fries which were good too - cost about $16 - pretty good deal in my book!  They have a varied selection of grinders, pizzas and a kid's menu - something for everyone!  I've sampled the pizzas before and they are pretty good, but usually stick to the grinders and I'm always happy with my choices!  So for lunch or a casual supper, I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for a few years.   A pretty nice place.  Decent grinders and good pizza.  We always get fried pickles too.  A good variety for going out with the family.  Good for groups and taking the team out after a game.  Very accommodating.   Have used the catering as well - worked out great.   Beer selection isn't huge, but I (beer snob) can always find 1 or 2 beers that are good.  Lately they have had local craft beer on tap - super!    One wish - I wish they had better wings - I guess I'm a wing snob too."}
{"text":"This joint is mediocre. The food is cheap, and you get what you paid for. I've been here a few times with other people and have always left unimpressed. I really can't understand what people find appealing about this place."}
{"text":"Second time here.   I decided on the large taco salad.  Your presentation was good and it tasted great until I uncovered the meat on the salad was burnt.  It's as if it was sitting in a pan and not stirred all day. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Yum! The staff made me a delicious PB&J pizza upon request! It was perfect! The banana pepper rings were great!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a long time and I always get their  \"Tribe\" sub.  Great new location and service. They also have a nice bar, drive-thru pick-up and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We really liked it!  Great selection with many choices to choose from.  Can't wait to go back and try a few more grinders to really hone in on a fav!!!"}
{"text":"I've been twice for pick up and I love the French dip it's basically on Cheesy garlic bread and has more then enough a jus to soak all the bread."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 2 times since moving to the area a little over a month ago. I have yet to be disappointed. So far I have had the cheese ravioli and the pizza and I wasn't let down. The pizza is even good cold, which I am pretty picky about. My only complaint is the price. It's a little steep for pizza."}
{"text":"I grew up eating here, and when I'm in town, I still stop in for a Grinder! Delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"Bellacino's is in a great location and probably looked great when it first opened 10 or so years ago.  Unfortunately when we ate lunch there on Thursday I was waiting for Robert Irvine and his \"Restaurant Impossible\" team to storm in and announce that they were going to make the place over; but it didn't happen.  Carpet looked dirty, everything looked worn, and the bathroom (with single uncovered fluorescent light bulb) smelled like pee, much like being at a gas station.  You order your food at the back counter in full view of the (very large) kitchen which looks dingy with burnt out light bulbs.  Menus are stacked on pile next to cash register; a menu board before you get to the register would be a nice addition.  Lunch for two with Cokes was about $20.  Wife had the Calazone which was ok if somewhat greasy and crust was flat.  My Buffalo Chicken sandwich was bland with chicken that tasted like it had been thawed and warmed; no hint of grilling or toasting.  Bread was good but chicken and sauce tasted institutional.   With a little sprucing up and fresher ingredients Bellacino's would be a great place; until then there are better places with better food at better prices."}
{"text":"I definitely was not impressed with this place. Which was odd because nothing but great things about it.  The dining was freezing and you could tell the plumping was older. I got an order of their oven baked fries and they were no where near as good a deep fried one and you could tell that they came out of a bag.   I ordered a personal pan pizza and it was a little greasy. I don't think I'd  go back on my own volition."}
{"text":"Strange sports bar with a drive up to go window... lots of TV coverage and a small full bar...  order at the counter... self serve soda... servers bring your food to the table... odd... but it worked for lunch.  They have a different food special every day... and after 9 pm... and a different drink special every day... and a beer tasting dinner next month.  A back room full of arcade video games... but not someplace I would call good for kids on game day... the advertising and signs seem more hard core bar... once football season starts again we will definitely check it out again.  Mac and cheese bites were really cheesy and really creamy... but very flat and sort of greasy... we would have them again for sure... just wish there were extra napkins at the table to blot them off.  There is a wheat crust option... the regular crust was tasty on the outer edge... but didn't cook all the way through in the center... even though the bottom was nice and brown... it was still chewy... but gummy too... we would try this again... but wouldn't call it a favorite.  The large sandwich is 18 inches long? The list of salads (and salad dressings) is expansive... they have online ordering?  All good reasons to try them again... and give take out a try... just wish I could shake the odd feeling when we were there."}
{"text":"Love the food here but the manager on duty tonight was a total a-hole!  My wife slipped on the wet floor and went down hard. The mgr was looking right at her and didn't even check on her. I went to speak with him to tell him he may want to clean up the pop she spilled, and maybe mop the floor, and he was nasty and argumentative.  He claimed he didn't see her fall, even though he was looking right at her.  I was seriously trying to alert him so no one else fell -- especially an older person.  As is, my wife was bleeding from her knee and elbow...not so much as a sibncere apology from the manager.  Lastly...they never did clean up the spilled pop.  Hopefully the owners see this, as I do love the food.  I believe the manager's name was \"Jim.\"  Shame on you, Jim!"}
{"text":"There is a large dine-in area that is child friendly with arcade games. The pretezel bites were awesome, hot and soft. The seafood salad was fair. The use imitation crab meat in a creamy base, similar to Neptune salad. My husband enjoyed his pizza, but Angelos in Lakewood is still his favorite. The lady at the counter who took our order was very friendly and helpful. She explained the specials and talked to my husband about their Cruisin' nights."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! I was with my large family tonight and there was probably only 3 other tables with people at them and 3 staff members standing around. After waiting 5 minutes for my drink I went to the back to find my waiter and just let him know we were going to go since the wait seemed long. Then the owner came out as we were packing up. He immediately began making excuses about the wait and asked me if 5 minutes was a long time and I said for a drink with no one one in the restaurant.... yes it was. He then laughed at me.  Trust me when I tell you me or anyone from my family will ever be back. Wow......the owner... DO NOT DINE HERE!"}
{"text":"A good, solid grinder. I like how they use ciabatta as the bread portion of the grinder. Atmosphere is kinda sports bar-ey. Nothing that'll change your life here, but very good for an informal weekday lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in stow! The grinders are super good too!"}
{"text":"My favorite go to for grinders! Pizza is average IMO."}
{"text":"I only rated it two stars because I have no idea how the food is since they only deliver to businesses with orders in excess of $40. I don't think this qualifies a business to advertise delivery services on Yelp, they're a carry out or dine-in establishment for the average consumer.   Due to the poor business model and my personal eating habits, It's pretty likely that I will never end up spending any money here. And that sucks, as I like to support local when I can.   I will mention that the guy who answered the phone was nice. He seemed genuinely apologetic about the owners crap business model. That's the only positive I have for this place, thus far. His professionalism earned these guys the second star."}
{"text":"I have been going to Bellacino's since they first opened in Stow several years ago. They recently moved to a new location not far down the road, and the place is beautiful. It's probably the most modern-looking restaurant in the city of Stow.   I moved out-of-town for college and have since graduated, but my parents still live there. Every time I visit them, I always eat at Bellacino's at least once. I always get the BLT Grinder & the garlic & cheese breadsticks. They are also open late, which is nice."}
{"text":"We are here today for my birthday and everything was great. We got seated very quickly and had a very friendly waitress named Lucy. Our food was amazing! We had pretzel bites which were the best I've ever had. I only wish we got more. Get them with pizza sauce! My husband and I both had salads. Very fresh and yummy! My Italian dressing was awesome. Then my son and I each had an 8in pizza. Very filling! I finished mine but he now has some for lunch tomorrow. My husband had a sub and he really enjoyed it. We will certainly be back. Very impressed with this place."}
{"text":"I've been getting subs and pizzas here for years and they never disappoint me. We usually do their pizza on Monday nites for their $9.99 specialty pizzas. They're  Alfredo Chicken is superb! If you want a change of pass, Bellacino's is excellent!"}
{"text":"Well, my mom and I stopped in to have a late lunch here today and let's just say things couldn't have gone worse. We were the only customers in the place, but it took 15 minutes to get a steak grinder (which according to the owner's son \"goes through the oven for 4 minutes\"). When I was finally given my grinder the mushrooms had been thrown on top of the dry meat and were shriveled. Also, the bread had been toasted into a hard brown rock. I took my sandwich up to the counter to ask for a non-burned (eatable) replacement and was told, \"it's just crunchy\" and that there was nothing wrong with it. The owner's son then proceeded to get in my face telling me how \"that's how they all come...[he] owns the place [he] knows what [he's] doing...\" And when I asked for a refund (because his attitude had caused me to lose my appetite) he again got in my face and said that he had done nothing wrong and refused to refund my money. Needless to say I left steaming mad---I have never been treated so poorly in my life!"}
{"text":"They're good, but it is pizza, afterall. Not sure about the five star ratings. I'll give it four but only because they have a slightly different taste to their sauce. A good kind of different, a little tangy. So based on the effort, a generous fourth star.  Complimenting the service here is interesting. Customers order food at a counter and then seat themselves. Along the way the soft drinks are self-serve. The food is delivered to your table, and you're really left alone to get your own drink refills and fetch extra napkins. A generous fourth star, again.  I'll be back next time I'm in Stow and looking for pizza and I'll either justify or pull off the fourth star."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bellacino's on our first date, and also after we got engaged, so it's always kind of held a special place in our hearts.  Their grinders are just so different than anything else you'll find. The bread they use is great, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I love the way the meat is finely chipped.   My personal favorite grinders are the Chicago Steak, Tuscan Chicken and French Dip. You can't go wrong with any of these three. All of them come with the sandwich bread turned into cheesy garlic bread on the inside. It's to die for.  The \"Tribe\"is my other favorite. Turkey ham and roast beef.   I've always liked the pizza here too. It's a little on the sweeter side.  If you order takeout, they have a drive-thru window you can use to pickup your order."}
{"text":"Generally, I'm a fan of Bellacino's. The biggest issue is that they are not terribly speedy. That can be okay, but the one thing you have to deal with is that it seems there is only a single, small oven, since everything comes out at different times, and only one person at a time gets to eat. Very odd. It's not just this location - every one I've ever been to has the same problem.  When the food finally does come out, it's generally good, if perhaps a bit over-salted, and this location was no different in that regard, but it was a bit like a ghost town. Located in the back corner of a newish development made it feel a little spooky at first, and even stranger as the time wore on. Once the food was delivered and we ate, we were out of there."}
{"text":"We put in an order to go. We were told that it would take 45 minutes to an hour which seemed like a long time to begin with. We showed up when we were told that our order would be ready. Unfortunately when we arrived we were then told it would take another 10-20 minutes. I don't find it acceptable for an order to take an hour and a half to prepare an order."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised. The place was busy. It is Valentines evening. We sat at the bar. From the moment we arrived we were greeted kindly by the door person, we sat at the bar, bartender was great, food was reasonable. Had these bell pepper things, fried, awesome. The pizza wasn't life changing but it was very good. It literally came out of the oven and was put in front of us. Fresh pizza makes a huge difference. When we left same customer service, we were wished well and thanked for coming. I could over hear the same service going on all over the place. It was refreshing."}
{"text":"Stopped in later on a friday night. We have passed this place about a hundred thousand times and finally walked in. The place looked a little bit like they had just got done being slammed with the main dinner rush, but that happens and the table we were shown to was clean. Sort of a sports bar/family pizza joint atmosphere. Looks like they had claw machines and stuff to keep the kids occupied, and a decent beer selection on tab to keep the adults occupied.   We had the Bellacino's Super Pizza. It was good, like damn good. Crust was just crispy enough, but didn't have that soaked in grease feeling like most crispier pizzas. Sauce had a nice flavor and the toppings were fresh. I am sad they don't deliver over to Kent because this pizza kicks ass over most of what is in Kent.  I want to go back and try some of the oven baked subs. They looked awesome going by on their way to other tables.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Good pizza. One of the few places in the area who carry green olives and jalapenos. Just make sure to ask for your pizza to be \"well done\", as their standard cooking time leaves it way too underdone and doughy."}
{"text":"Well, I got my food. It was pretty tasty, but the attitudes were still piss poor when I picked it up. I guess I'd still return, but only on a day that I know I wouldn't freak out on someone for poor customer service and bad attitudes."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a great toasted sandwich & good service too. I like that they offer out door seating, a variety of items on the menu but not too chaotic & it's always clean."}
{"text":"We are big fans of this place. Food is great and price is right. They are also very community oriented which is appealing. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"Bellacino's is a decent Italian pizza and hoagie (grinder) shop. I have eaten from here before, but it was a while back, so I decided to try it again today.   Atmosphere - standard pizza shop, seating area is smaller than a full blown restaurant   Food - I have had their pizza awhile back and it was decent. Greasy and flavorful like a good northeast style pizza. On this visit, I wanted a takeout grinder (see sub, hoagie, hero, poor boy) which is cooked, as a sandwich from a pizza shop should. I had the Italian Grinder, which is the House Specialty and consists of Ham, sausage, salami, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes & mayo. I said \"sans the mayo and add Italian dressing\". The hoagie (to me it is a hoagie...okay!) was toasty deliciousness. I like the fact that they use fresh mushrooms here and not canned (Who wants mushy mush on their food?). Like others have stated about this franchise, the hoagie is large. I got a half and it was perfectly sized for me.   Service - This was a to go order, but the guy at the register was nice and my food was made quickly and to specification.   Price - w/ coupon 5.99   Overall - This is a decent place to grab a pizza or grinder (hoagie!)."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch and loved it.  Seat yourself on slow days, order from a counter, but they brought our food to us when it was done.  Clean and neat and even a game are for kids.  KIDS EAT FREE ON WEDNESDAYS so I really enjoy that, since I have 2 hungry boys.  Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Under new management, this place is great!  We didn't try any of the alcoholic beverages, but tried out a good variety of the menu:  the pickle chips were a unique choice for appetizer the taco pizza was a tasty speciality pizza the pepperoni pizza was a classic pizza with the perfect amount of toppings.   The real showstopper was the service here! Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. The owner came over and talked and bonded with us   It was a great experience! Can't wait to try out a grinder!"}
{"text":"This is the second time this has happened in a months time, which is why I'm leaving a review. Called in to order a pickup item, just a grinder. Told it will be 15 minutes. Drop off the family at the nearby ice cream place so they can get a cone while I pick up my dinner. Things are timed perfectly. I'm even a few minutes behind my pick up time when I arrive at the pick up window. Only to be told that they \"forgot\" to put my order in and it just went into the oven. Ugh. Exact same thing I was told a few weeks back. Except this time I do not have time to wait. Young man tells me it will be two minutes. Not sure how that's possible if it \"just went in.\" So I say that if it really is two minutes I'll wait. He ducks inside and talks to someone and comes back out stumbling over what to say but finally says it will be a few minutes. I can tell he isn't confident in his \"few minutes\" comment. I tell him my ice cream predicament and he says Ice cream won't melt that much. He obviously has had no experience with kids with cones on a warm, humid evening, I decline. He hands me back my money, ducks in the window and says to a girl \"wow, what a....\" And the window closes. I can imagine the rest of his sentence. Second time forgetting my order. Second time no apology. This time the young man was offended that I had a schedule to keep and couldn't accommodate their mess up. Too bad, we order from here often. No more. My money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great, fresh,  tasty sammiches/grinders with nice fluffy bread!  Big menu with much to choose from.  Friendly employees too!  Love the 2 for $10 Tuesday special! Mmmmm...yum!"}
{"text":"I think the Pizza is about 2 stars but actually enjoy the Grinders enough to rate them a total of 3.  The bread they are served on is both light and crispy/crunchy when it comes out of the oven/toaster or whatever it is they put it in and I like they way they melt the cheese to a bubbly goodness.  The bread is also proportional, e.g. it doesn't overwhelm the meat like a sub from say, Harris Teeter does.  Staff could use a couple Dale Carnegie courses though."}
