{"text":"Awesome food and amazing customer service. I'd eat here everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"Disappointed again, overpriced for the quality and the portions, printed menu not available (catering only) forced to read the board which is hard to see, menu board confusing not worth the time to read each item or figure out what sides are offered, outside sitting was filled with people eating Qdoba or Brixx management did not remove them to allow their customers a seat outside, weak."}
{"text":"Love JD Rocker's! It's great for a quick sandwich or salad. I absolutely love getting salads there - a huge portion and tons of toppings to choose from, and it's delicious. It's definitely just basic seating on the inside and can get easily crowded, but worth it for a quick bite or takeout."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite sandwich places. I love the rockstar and moshpit. My wife loves the salads. If you want a quick affordable meal give JD rockers a shot!"}
{"text":"Love their salads, made to order! They have wide selection of toppings as well. They also mix everything together for you so the good stuff isn't just on the top. Only reason for four stars is because for a walk up and order place it's a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I got the #13 Rocker, the garlic knots and the french onion soup. Even though I ordered the Rocker warm it came out luke warm - I expected hotter - a little too much sauce but the right amount of meat and cheese - overall the #13 was nothing special, but tasty. The garlic knots I could have done without - not what I expected - they were a little raw/doughy. The french onion soup was really good. The inside was very small and the line was very slow compared to the amount of people working at the time - I counted at least 5 people working, but only one taking orders. Because the place is so small, your clothes will smell like the place when you leave - I would like to see better ventilation.   I agree with the other reviewer - great place to stop in if you are hungry while shopping but don't care for any atmosphere or the other rest. are on a wait.   I will try it one more time and see if they got any of the kinks out."}
{"text":"I've been to JD Rockers twice and while the food isn't bad, I think it is overpriced for the quality and quantity. The menu is a pain - it is scattered in a variety of locations and doesn't clearly state what comes with what (ie: this comes with a side, this doesn't, a kids meal includes...). The salads are good but the tomatoes tasted like they were marinated in beer. The hot dogs are rather large. The Philly is good size and has a nice flavor but it should not be soo greasy. Overall, I won't go back unless the other places in Birkdale are on a wait."}
{"text":"When thinking of somewhere to go for lunch, I rarely think of this place, but whenever I wind up there somehow, I always ask myself why I don't come more often.   I always love their sandwiches, and my wife loves the salads.  They have a small outside eating area, that's somewhat cramped, but I appreciate the attempt.   I've probably had 1/4 of the sandwich menu, and I've liked everything I've ordered.  If you're in the mood for a sandwich or salad in Birkdale, this is probably your best bet, and you shouldn't be disappointed.  If you are disappointed, then ask yourself what you expect from two pieces of bread, meat, and condiments.  If you leave angrily in your disappointment and go to Subway, then you should go bash yourself in the face with a stale loaf of bread."}
