{"text":"I really wish I liked this place more than I do. It's close to home, decently priced and everyone here seems really nice.   The problem, after four visits, is that there just isn't enough food here that is either (1) good or (2) unique.  Take the weekend breakfast buffet. $8.95 for 14 items (you can see the list in the picture of the menus). With one exception (the French toast, which is good), everything here is OK... But there isn't anything you can't get from Golden Corral. And because GC is busier, their food doesn't steam half to death in the metal coffins.   The fresh fruit assortment looked sad-- appeared to come out of a blister-packed container of stuff sold at the GFS store a few miles east on Lorain Road. The apple sauce and cottage cheese both came out of big foodservice tubs.  I had Orange Juice. It tasted funny, so I sent it back. My wife spotted the Smith's label on the gallon jug she poured the replacement from. I'm paying $1.89 for 8 ounces of made from concentrate.   At both lunch and dinner, every single vegetable side they served-- except for the fried potatoes (which are superb)-- obviously came out of a can. You can see the sad little puddle of watery juice at the bottom of the bowl. I'd just as soon not get a vegetable.  The pies in the dessert case are Mama Jo's pies. Yes, they're good-- but I can buy those at Marc's at Great Northern.  The salads are the predictable sad iceberg mix with ice-cold tomatoes. Other than the house dressing, everything taste like it came out of a bottle. The rolls are tasty-- but they're also \"heat and serve\".   So what's good? What got two people to return three times? The soups are genuinely excellent. The had one or two each time and THEY were made from scratch. Absolutely worth it.  We showed up the day after St, Pat's and got some of the corned beef. THAT was good. So was the cabbage. Didn't have it in a sandwich, but I'd be willing to order that. (Although Joe's in Rocky River is better.)  The gyro and the Grecian platter were good. So was the Athenian platter. Not surprising, since the proprietors are Greek. I'd bet the Greek Salad is good-- probably the Chicken Kebabs (it has the same meat as the stuff in the Athenian platter).. Again, it's undercut by the large number of good gyro places around.  Their lasagna (a special) and chicken parmesan was unique. The tomato sauce has greek spices. I wasn't wild about it, but it was definitely original; you might love it. (It really made me wish they had a spinach or veggie lasagna-- or an eggplant parm).   There's probably more good stuff there-- but we ran out of the energy needed to keep searching. You're paying $10-15 per person (with drink, tip and dessert). That's not unreasonable, but when the results have been ordinary too often you don't feel like gambling on \"Chicken-fried steak.\" It might be brilliant-- or it could be stringy meat with limp breading lying in a pile of library paste (that's what the sausage gravy from breakfast tasted like).  I'd sooner give someone else a first chance, rather than these guys a fifth.  We'll come back for carry-outs of soup, but that'll be it."}

{"text":"We were out at the Soccer Sportsplex on Lorain Road this weekend, and needed a quick spot for lunch -- anything but fast food (which is mostly what is in the area). We saw this, on a rainy afternoon, and took a chance. A great little neighborhood cafe! we were in luck. They had homemade Italian wedding soup, and several ethnic type specialties -- weinerschnitzel, stuffed pork chops, etc.  Prices are extremely reasonable here. You can eat a nice lunch for $6.99 or breakfast (weekdays) for $2.99! can't hardly go wrong. But of course, the acid test is \"is the food good\"? Yes, it was! We enjoyed everything we ordered.  Nothing like hot soup on a cold rainy day; this hit the spot! a cup is only $1.99, a huge bargain. It tasted homemade, with lots of farro or some oval grain in it and lots of tiny chicken meatballs. My husband had a very good burger with crisp fries, a good value at $5.49 for a cheeseburger on a delicious toasted bun. Even with the soup and fries, he didn't crack $10.  I had the stuffed pork chop special; two fork tender stuffed porkchops in rich gravy, with mashed potatoes and green beans. (I also had the soup.) It was $8.99 and the two meaty pork chops would have probably fed two smaller appetites (or one to take home). They were the BEST I've had in ages -- only my grandma's could have compared! The gravy was very good, the mashed potatoes OK (probably instant, but OK) and the green beans, canned. If I had to do again, I'd have substituted the crisp french fries -- and had them drown 'em in that gravy. YUM.  We did not have time for desert, but passed the desert case, with some yummy looking pudding, pies and other sweets. It was a plain, but clean eatery with good service and food was piping hot. Beats any fast food around, and for not much more $$$.  There was a very tasty looking breakfast buffet, for $8.99 -- all you can eat, with the typical brunch items.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. We will go out of our way to eat here again!"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday for the weekend breakfast buffet. The restaurant was very slow, with between 1-4 tables being used during our visit. The service here is very lacking. Our waitress rarely checked on us, and we had to ask for basics, such as ketchup and coffee creamer. At one point, I had to serve coffee to our table as there was no employee to be found. The food is mediocre, usual breakfast fare. One positive is the breakfast sausage is the GFS one that is delicious. My 2 year old son ate free, but we probably will have to keep searching for a good breakfast buffet.  Edit: there is no changing table in either bathroom. I had to change my 2 year old's diaper in the trunk of my car."}
{"text":"I try for months now to eat there, the place is closed. I can't out whether for good or just temporary"}
{"text":"We had a delicious lunch here. We have booked a family birthday party here for 22 people. Bring your own alcohol; no corkage fee.     Great desserts from cheesecakes to Greek rice pudding!"}
