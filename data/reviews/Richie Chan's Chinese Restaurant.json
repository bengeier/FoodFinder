{"text":"I really love this place.  Nice people and good to great food.  My new favorite is the lemon chicken.  I also like the singapore noodles and the kung pau pork.  Mrs. Chan remembers regular customer's preferences.  Cash only.  I only occasionally get lemon chicken because at other places it can be soggy and gloppy.  This one was lightly crispy and the lemon sauce tasted fresh and lemony.  A treasure in cleveland heights."}
{"text":"Got the vegetable lo mein and Hunan tofu. Food was prepared very fast. There was a lot of it and overall was good quality. We got a complimentary orange. 

Was it the best Chinese food I've ever had? No. But it is far better than many other Chinese places I've eaten at and the quality:money ratio is very good. Would I go back? Definitely."}
{"text":"Good fish fillet! (Yi Pien)
Good Baby Bok Choy!

but the food that kept me from coming back again and again and again is their Perfectly fried chicken wings!  
nothing beats their wings! it makes me fly each time I bite onto it....

*drools......"}
{"text":"This place is so good and cheap too. We've ordered a lot of different dishes off the menu and everything is extremely good. It does look like a hole in the wall, but that is what makes it great. The owner is extremely friendly too. We've only done takeout but they do have a couple tables where you can eat in. Just a reminder that they only except cash."}
{"text":"Sought out this place with my 9-year old daughter based on Yelp reviews.  Yelpers painted a pretty accurate picture of the place, both decor (minimalist and a bit tattered, but by no means dirty) and food (diverse selections, tasty, honest food).  We got the veggie lo me in, moo shu chicken, and wonton soup.  A tad bit under seasoned (but better than overseasoned!) but very tasty, with huge portions.  Overall a very positive experience."}
{"text":"Ehhh this place is cheap, but honestly the food is not great.  There are other of tasty chinese restaurants in the area that are more worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered the pepper steak it tasted like steak should, not gummy like a lot of other Chinese food don't know if it's there marinade. But this place was good not great but Good egg roll was just OK wonton soup was good fried rice was good but mushy.. The crab Rangoon was absolutely awful. I will definitely go back they have a big menu..BIG TIP FOR EVERYONE BRING CASH, they don't accept credit cards!!!!"}
{"text":"Sketchiness practically radiates from the storefront, which is not really a storefront but a bunch of floor to ceiling windows covered by long vertical blinds. Inside, it doesn't get much better, but those who have grown up in my father's generation in China will immediately recognize the communal-style layout. A part of me wonders whether the \"Out of Service\" sign on the bathroom has been there as long as the vintage soda vending machine. 

It's a mom-and-pop shop in the rawest sense (although I'm not actually sure if they have children or not); the duo performs everything from ordering (at the counter), cooking, and cleaning. They take only cash now, and you can pay as soon as you order or wait until you're done eating. Mr. \"Richie Chan\" doesn't talk much - I'm not sure if it's because he doesn't know English very well, but even after we started talking in Chinese he wasn't talkative. We had to shout a few times as well to draw his attention away from the TV to take our order. The Mrs. was much more outgoing and chatted with us later about the unusual characters that came in through the door. 

We were the only patrons in the restaurant at the time, although two piles of dirty dishes on the smaller two (out of three) tables revealed that others had potentially also dined in. Most people get take-out, and given the uncomfortable encounters we had with the people who came in, I probably would too in the future. The food was cheap, and our three dishes (which included rice) and soup ended up lasting us through two meals. The Hunan Beef wasn't spicy so much as sour and I would not recommend it, but their Mu Shu Pork is the real deal. We were served complementary orange slices after the meal. 

Okay, so this isn't exactly on my list of best restaurants, but as far as authenticity goes, most of it is legit. The \"Chans\" are honest folks and keep it simple."}
{"text":"Ordered Mongolian beef over the phone and went to pick it up, came home and did not find Mongolian beef in my take out. It was some kind of veggie beef stir fry. It was ok not incredible, slightly spicy. 
Won't try this place again"}
{"text":"I'm not one to leave negative reviews but this place left a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively.

We ordered honey chicken, which apparently meant sweet and sour chicken with honey instead of sweet and sour sauce. Chicken nuggets with honey dipping sauce would've been better... The egg rolls were Not egg rolls, the rice was not very good and the lo mein was not good either. The portions were appropriate for the price, but nothing tasted good to us.

The do not take cards, which, in this century is unacceptable in terms of customer service... It's so easy to get a square card reader... So I had to run across the street in the rain to get some cash out of a nearby ATM.

The staff is friendly, and though the establishment itself is dimly lit and fairly small, it wasn't dirty, so that's good.

Overall we will not be eating here again as we were sorely disappointed, and I would consider what we ordered to be pretty \"safe\" choices."}
{"text":"The best Hot and Sour soup anywhere. 
The owner takes pride in his cooking Always consistently fresh and very flavorful. Mainly a to go place but there is room for several people to eat in if they wish. Don't expect much atmosphere if you stay. People are always nice and work hard. Give them a try. I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had yet.
Don't let the shady exterior deter you from trying this place.
Most Chinese restaurants taste exactly the same and the menus are pretty much identical no matter where you go.  NOT this place.
I'm not sure what it is...but the food tastes different, but in a great way."}
{"text":"Theres a not-so-secret rule in the restaurant biz: some of the biggest holes in the wall have the best food. That rule applies here. Its cool and old school, a tad run down. Overlook that and you'll find the best Chinese in town. Szechuan is to die for. You get rice, an eggroll, a piece of fruit plus a fortune cookie. Add a lottle soy and you're good to go. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Easily the tastiest and most authentic Chinese food in the University Heights area, and at a reasonable price. I took off a star mainly because they only accept cash, which is pretty inconvenient.

Admittedly, I have only had two of their dishes (Kung Pao chicken and cashew chicken), but the flavors slay the other Chinese-carryout restaurants in the area. Perhaps the biggest compliment to their quality, however, is that a lot of Chinese students from Case eat here. When you hear the Chinese language being spoken in front of the counter and not just behind it, that says something about the food's authenticity, I think. (They specialize in Cantonese-style dishes, by the way.)

The signage outside is so meager you might wonder if they did this intentionally, just to prove to the world, \"Only weak businesses need signs.\" Seriously, I have to think that Google maps and Yelp are the only reasons anyone new to the area knows about this place.

The inside is quite humble, between the folding tables (which they keep clean, I should note), out-of-service vending machine, and home-printed wall menus. On a positive note, Richie's usually empty, which means you can expect your food rather quickly.

Contrary to what some reviewers have written, the bathroom isn't actually out-of-order like the sign on its door says. You just need to ask for the key. Weird, I know. But this is Richie Chan's, and you're here for one thing: good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is cheap and very gooooooooood.
I always go there with 3-5 people, we all are full to death, but we've never pay more than $10 each. It's always around $8. 
The food quality is good. If something in the fridge is not fresh or not good enough, a cook will tell us and never cook that for us. An owner is very friendly and very kind. We like her a lot. 
This is very good place to go for a low budget student like us!!!

This is the menu that we love
-Deep fried fish
-Salty hot pepper shrimp
-some kind of vegetable which I don't remember the name
-chicken wings"}
{"text":"Absolute authentic Cantonese dishes just like home-made! My favorite one if I want to taste food like home made. They might not offer fancy dishes that you can usually get in large Chinese restaurant, but you can find good dishes like steamed chicken, steamed fish, pork chop with soy bean, duck etc.

I like going there after evening classes. The owners are very nice and I can call to preorder my food. When I arrive, the food are ready in a minute. Great price that no one can beat and the portion is large."}
{"text":"This has a very...how shall I say...  modest look.  It is a Mom and Pop shop.  The owners are very nice.  The portions are humongous, and for the amount that you get, it is very well priced.  My party of 3 got 2 entrees, one combo dish, and one extra carton of rice to eat in the restaurant.  We left with more than half of the food.  All for just 22 dollars. 

On to the food.  I tried the Kungpao chicken, mooshoo pork, and the sweet and sour pork (I know, it is the one thing I shouldn't have ordered just because I'm asian)
Kungpao chicken is basically chicken and veggies with a lot of brown sauce.  It's not bad.  I wouldn't really call it true Kungpao, but it goes well with rice.  
Mooshoo pork - Actually pretty good.  It is a bit on the sweet side for me, but the mixture of eggs, cabbage, and pork went very well with the rice as well.
Sweet and Sour pork - now... This is just fried battered pieces of pork (a bit dry) with a very runny sweet and sour sauce.  There was a good crisp to the pork, but I am not a fan of that sauce.  The one thing that was surprising was how the dishes weren't as oily as you would expect from a regular chinese take out, though I can only speak for my dishes. 

Ambience wise, there is none.  There are just 3 long folding tables set up in the front.  Order up front from the extensive menu on the wall, find yourself a seat, and the nice owner will bring out your food.  

I'll definitely come back, but maybe next time I'll take it to go."}
{"text":"There seems to be a little Chinese takeout place on every corner of Cleveland. They range from Ok to pretty good. Most have a very similar approach and food; many even seem to use the same menu and menu board with just the restaurant name changed. At first glance Richie Chan's at Cedar Lee (13181 Cedar Rd) in Cleveland Heights, may fit in with all the rest, but a closer look will reveal something completely different. This is not your average Chinese takeout place. 

Walking in to Richie Chan's there are 3 tables out front, using the Goldilocks approach, 1 small, 1 medium and 1 large. The difference from most takeout places is that you will frequently find these tables filled. That's right, this is not just takeout. An especially good sign is the frequently the customers are Asian. The decor is not much, some old Chinese prints right out of most older Chinese Restaurants, hang high on the walls. The floor is covered with industrial runner carpets, but they try to make the place feel homey and while a bit run down it is clean. 

When you look at the menu you will notice that Richie Chan's has its own menu. All of the standards are there Chow Mein, Egg Foo Young, Lo Mein, Fried Rice and Combination Plates; these are all done very well.  You will notice other options, including some very good noodle dishes, fish dishes and others you won't see at most takeouts. Then in addition to the menu there are additional items that are posted in Chinese, you can ask for an explanation, but the best option is to watch the other tables and ask what they have. 

The food that comes out is generally very good to excellent. Among my favorites is the Shrimp Lo Mein, the Singapore Chow Mei Funn and the Shrimp Chow Mein Cantonese style. Let me talk about the last Cantonese Chow Mein. At Richie Chan's you get a large serving of fresh fried noodles (think similar to pan fried noodles, but with bigger noodles) with good sized shrimp and baby bok choy in a delicious white sauce. Overall food quality and taste is excellent. In addition there are a number of items that are definitely not take out style. There are several fish dishes and I have tried the Salty Peppery Shrimp special which is excellent. The shrimp are fried in a very light batter which has a real peppery kick. The large portion of delicious shrimp are served over a bed of lettuce and topped with slices of very small, very hot green and red peppers. A spicy, slightly sweet red dipping sauce is served on the side. Wonderful, especially if you want something that will wake up your tongue with a lot of heat. 

Service is an interesting point, depending on what you order, you may be served in Styrofoam or on traditional plates. That's right a \"takeout place\" that serves on regular plates. Also you will usually get a choice of hot or cold tea and a little plate of fruit. 

At lunch you can choose from the very tasty combinations that are reasonably priced and they are one of the best values in town. To summarize the experience, the decor and setting is takeout, but the food and the friendly family approach is a winner. This is not the place to take someone to impress them, but if you want very good Chinese food at a reasonable price, this is the place to go. A definite winner and worth trying, even if just getting an order to go on your way home from downtown."}
{"text":"I visit this place when I'm  hanging out in the HTS and want  quality Asian food. Yes this place looks sketchy, but is not. The kitchen is clean.

This is  a 2 person operation. I assume they are  husband and wife, as I have never seen other people working here. They have a small dinning room, it can seat maybe 10 or 12 people. Primarily this is takeout.

The menu has your typical American Chinese fair such as lomein, the generals, wonton soup..... On the flip side  they serve some fairly authentic stuff like baby bok dishes, hofun, black bean sauce, chinese broccoli fish etc....

I had baby bok choy with chicken and Chinese sausage. This was excellent, bok was fresh and perfectly cooked, chinese sausage gave the dish a slightly sweet but savory taste. 

Friend ordered chicken and broccoli, by the shear weight of the platter 2 people could have eaten this and been stuffed. This was much better quality than other carry out places in the area.
Prices are reasonable.
One thing, given them a few minutes to cook your food,  I did not see them taking any short cuts."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese ever. Seriously. Chinese takeout is usually like pizza. Even if it's bad, it's still pretty freakin' good, but Richie Chan just shits all over that notion.

- Crab rangoons tasted sour and came with a weird tangy, spicy sauce (versus the usual sweet & sour).
- Mongolian chicken - The sauce very distinctly tasted like A1 steak sauce. The more I tried to force it down, the more convinced I was that they actually did cook it in steak sauce, along with vegetables that I've never seen in any Mongolian chicken dish anywhere. So much WTF, but oh wait, there's more...
- Sesame chicken - you'd think for such a common dish, no Chinese joint can get it wrong, but Richie Chan crosses his arms and scoffs at the challenge like Sagat from Street Fighter 2. The chicken was actually cut up pieces of the precooked, breaded, processed chicken that is usually intended for Sweet & Sour chicken. Laziness, and that's not even the worst of it. Not only was the chicken dry and stale, the sauce was 100% wrong. It tasted like the sauce for honey chicken, and they straight up just threw sesame seeds on top of it to try to pass it off. It was awful. Couldn't even finish half of it. 

When the free plate of oranges slices came, we ate every single slice to wash the terrible flavor off of our palates and, needless to say, didn't ask for a to-go box.

Rant mode: It is truly mind-boggling how this place can get more than 3 stars on yelp. I am offended that they thought they could pass these dishes off as (faux) Chinese. I sat there for a few minutes trying to piece together a scenario in which my meal was maybe a fluke. Maybe the original cook wasn't there? Maybe he just made a mistake with the sauces? No. Two dishes that were done VERY wrong in so many ways. This isn't a case of overcooking, undercooking, or a bad batch of sauce or meat. This was a horrifying murder of Chinese takeout as I know it. Excuse the hyperbole. It was that bad. Don't go here. Turn around. Drive away as fast as you can. Amazing Wok II is down the street. Do the right thing."}
{"text":"Food was good.  EGG ROLLS SOO DELICIOUS!!! Also everything was served fresh. Service was also nice we ordered to go."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese restaurant
Reasonable price good tested and friendly
Will eat everyday"}
{"text":"Best Chinese takeout I've ever had. It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall place. We call it 'Richie Chinese' because one time for about 2 months, the half of the sign that says 'Chan's Restaurant' was burned out.  Nobody cared. 

There is nothing fancy about this place at all. But that's the best part. No bathroom, cash only, mish-mash handwritten menu tacked to the wall, half of it in Chinese - all of this adds to the aura. When you get your food, you'll understand. They just don't give a crap about the decor, your credit card, or the fact that the 'special of the day' was the special 4 years ago and every day since then because they are too busy kicking ass at making Chinese food.

All your favorites are here - Kung Pao is awesome! But also some less common items as well (salty hot pepper shrimp, salty fish fried rice, and a whole section of black bean sauce dishes.) We love this place and get their takeout every couple of weeks when we're feeling lazy. Huge portions, fresh ingredients and an orange with every order!

They do have some seating and I've seen real live Asian people eating in there almost every time we go - usually a good sign for me.The owners are a super cute husband-wife team and they do a fantastic job. My favorite part is when you order, the lady turns around and barks out the order in Chinese to her husband who never says a word or looks over, just keeps busting it out at the stove.

Great service, awesome food. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I've had better chinese food many time at many places. But I am in cleveland now so I eat at a three star chinese place. Good menu selection. Good pricing. GREAT portions. And the foods not bad most of the time. well make that half the time isnt bad."}
{"text":"Had the sweet and sour chicken and honey chicken with fried rice. The chicken is a nice white meat with good flavor and a crispy breading. I really enjoyed both dishes. This place is a hole in the wall, but the food is good. I will definitely be returning to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Thoroughly confused and hungry... that's what came to mind after reading the reviews of Richie Chan's then actually trying their food.  Yes, Richie Chan's is a hole in the wall and yes, it's definitely cheap.  My experience was awful leaving only my garbage can full.  In hindsight, I would have gotten a better meal across the street at CVS chowing down on potato chips and slim jim's.

When I try a new chinese place I stick with the basics before venturing off into your more advanced fair.  General Tso is about as basic as it gets.  Similar to another reviewer, I found that the chicken was pre-cooked slices, breaded, deep fried and drown in sauce.  You don't need to be an expert in cooking to realize that cooked chicken, cooked again in smaller pieces creates a dry, fibrous and tasteless experience.  Combine that with the over-fried batter and it was like a rawhide treat for your dog.

The chicken wasn't the only overcooked disappointment for the afternoon.  An order of crab rangoon was just as disappointing.  Instead of crunchy but light wonton shell with a creamy filling, it too was overcooked rock hard and tasteless.

At some point this place may have been a great place to eat but they have now gone down the path of pre-prepared and overcooked food with loads of sauces to cover up the taste.  Perhaps the \"authentic\" fare is better but when they're cutting corners and messing up on the basics, I'd rather try my luck elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is very interesting! I first found this place when I was thinking about places to take my parents to. I know my parents would only eat asian food, so this is one of the places we visited.

My first time there, it was a pleasant experience. My dad was too lazy to read the menu so he went talk to the owner (this place is owned by an old couple), and just named some dishes that he would like to eat. They are not even on the menu but since the dishes my dad wanted were pretty well-known in China, the owner had no problem cooking them and serving us. They tasted DELICIOUS and just like my mom's cooking! I was SO SURPRISED that such authentic Chinese food exist in the U.S.

I was so excited about this place that I took my boyfriend there after my parents left. Since I am not as brave and \"friendly\" as my dad, I just ordered stuff that's on the menu, and the food was kinda disappointing - they tasted just like any other chinese restaurants in the U.S. - americanized chinese food, but they are not bad at all, just not as MSG charged as other chinese restaurants in town.

Overall, not a bad place to go for REALLY CHEAP chinese food and if you speak chinese or know something about chinese food, go talk to the owner (the lady) and she might surprise you!"}
{"text":"The Verdict: Reminds me of home :')

The Food: Offers authentic Chinese (Cantonese) food along with fast Chinese food staples. I had Cantonese chow fun w/ chicken and the noodles were crispy and the wet sauce is meant to be poured over the crispy noodles. It totally hits the spot! My friend got the egg foo young and it's a clear-like sauce with egg and meat and veggies over rice. That dish was very well made too!

The Extras: Great affordable prices. There's a parking lot on the side, tables, and you have a view of the clean and large kitchen. The 2 workers are super nice and speak English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. Their cooking is not superior restaurant quality, it reminds me more of dishes your Chinese parents would cook."}
