{"text":"I'm very surprised about the other positive reviews. We went here the other night and left quite disappointed. The service was great, but everything from the wine they served to the sushi was just not great - definitely not 5 star worthy. Sushi was tasteless and in some cases, on the margin of being edible.   But to be fair, it's winter here, so maybe they weren't able to get some fresher fish. I might have had a different opinion during summer months, but I won't be going back any time soon. There's too many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés manger à ce restaurant avec nos coupons Groupon. Nous n'avions pas d'attente vraiment concernant le restaurant. Sa fait des années que nous avons pas eu une expérience comme celle-là, unique et exceptionnelle. Les sushis etaient plus que parfait, le goût y était et le poisson était définitivement frais. Les dumplings etaient tout aussi suculent ainsi que la soupe miso. Les prix sont plus qu'arbodable et la qualité des produit y est. Le service que nous avons reçu nous a marqué, pour que la propriétaire vienne s'assoeir à nos côtés pour nous expliquer comment le poisson est choisi c'est que l'expérience client est une priorité. Nous avons même pu avoir un dessert gratuit grâce à sa générosité. Par cette expérience nous avons loué ce restau pour événement pour pouvoir partager ces saveurs uniques avec nos proches. Merci à l'équipe !!!"}

{"text":"A gem we found totally by chance last night when we were looking for Brazilian reso right beside! And for me as a sushi addict it was like a dream! The quality is great! sushies are fresh and the price is unbelievably low! Also they use fish generously which is  rare in sushi places with affordable price! All in all it was a great!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was a very sad experience.We went on a saturday night and we were the only table of the night.you can walk by on the busy stlaurent street in the mile end and easily miss this restaurant because there is no sign,only pale prints for \"sake grillades\" on the window.on the inside,there are blue led lights that prevents you from seeing anything clearly.which might be to their advantage.there were pictures of soups and sushis that had been cut out of magazines and were glued on the window.Being the only table you would figure the waiter may give us a better service but he didn't seem to care to pour our sake or describe any of the food he brought us.Which may have been to his advantage again.we had grilled shrimps and squid as apetizers.the grilled shrimp tasted of vietnamese seasoning and the grilled squid came as fried calamaris with mayo. ordered 20 pieces chef's selection,and every maki and sushi had salmon,boiled shrimp and tamago.the salmon quality was ok but overall a sad variety of sushi.the rice had an aftertaste,maybe from a lack of balance with rice vinegar or a poor quality rice i'm not sure.overall i am sad to see restaurants like this do so poorly.maybe if it had a different formula,cheaper prices or in a different neighborhood it could work.i wish it well"}
