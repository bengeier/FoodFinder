{"text":"Tried them out for the first time tonight. Good food. Great service (co-owner). We would come back just because of her. The food is a bonus. I had chicken parm. My wife had the special (chicken, artichoke, cavatelli). Portions are large enough that we had to bring food home. The bread is fresh and hot. Excellent value given the quality. Give them a try. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent, but don't tell anyone. I want to get a table the next time I am here! From bread to salad to main course, all was well prepared and tasty!"}
{"text":"We checked out this new italian restaurant last night and we're pleasantly surprised!  The staff was nice and welcoming, clearly a family vibe to the place!   The restaurant decor itself was simple and casual and the bar area looked appealing.   We were seated at a table for 2 and ordered the cheesy risotto balls for an appetizer- huge and delicious!  All of the entrees come with a side salad and garlic bread balls which were good as well.  our entrees come out very fast- almost too fast as we hadn't finished our app or salads but there wasn't anyone else there so the kitchen wasn't busy. Our entrees were delicious- fruitti does mares and alfredo penne with chicken.   Huge portions but for the price they were the right size (would possibly suggest if they ever alter their menu maybe adding a half size portion option).  All the food appears home made, the sea food was great and he alfredo sauce was very delicious.  We would recommend you check them out soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic new place. Many food choices, nice wine list. Fairly priced,large portions. The quality of everything we had was excellent! Wide open and spacious. The outside really fools you. We really needed another good restaurant in Brecksville and you guys hit it right  on the nose. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The owners are facing a serious challenge, but we think they are up for the struggle.  While they advertise as the only Italian restaurant in Brecksville,  there are several other quality ones in neighboring suburbs of 7 Hills, Broadview Heights and North Royalton.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, starting with our professional  and delightful server, Jenna.  Altho we usually start a meal with the wedding soup to see the respective Italian restaurants' take on this item but  we were curious to try the arancini - a new item for us (non Italians) and were not disappointed with the risotto cakes accompanied by pesto and red sauce.  Altho the wine list is a work in progress, we had two domestics - a generous pour at a fair price.  The house salads were surprisingly good - fresh with excellent attention to detail - no bags used here and no spiny white lettuce pieces.  Our entrees were overly generous in size, altho we enjoyed the leftovers - carefully packed by Jenna.  My wife's chicken marsala was outstanding.  My lasagna could have used a few spoonfuls more sauce, but still enjoyable.  The refilled garlic bread-roll  basket was great for nibbling and sauce dipping.  We both look forward to trying the seafood items and veal spiedini.  As I stated initially, this restaurant faces a challenge, but with the interesting menu, generous portions and professional service, they are obviously excepting the area will appreciate their efforts."}
{"text":"The food is great. The new owners have made this a great spot in Brecksville. This is absolutely one of our new go to places."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Each time was a good experience. Very good food and desserts. The garlic knots and tiramisu are my favorites."}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Nice to know we can stay in brecksville and have Little Italy quality food without driving to Murray Hill. Very kid friendly too!"}
{"text":"Wow! Stopped here and found a treasure tonight. Best Italian meal that I've had in decades. They just opened 2 weeks ago and under new management. 
Yummy bread, salads, and the 2 entrees we ordered were both a 5!! 
I would highly recommend it. 
Yes, they had a full bar, too. And, 2 TVs for game watching if that's what you like."}
{"text":"6/2/18 Rolls were buttery and good. Cesar was sub par. No anchovies available and tiny croutons. The top shelf Long Island was off the mark. Lasagna was a bit runny, but good. The chicken marsala was delicious. Comes in an awesome sweet sauce. Service was slow, especially for only having a couple of guests. Atmosphere is not great, as it's in an old strip mall and has that feel inside. Overall quality of the food is good."}
{"text":"Just reopened under new management two weeks ago.  Wish them well.  Excellent staff, great food (loved the lasagna), pleasant surroundings."}
{"text":"Pasta was great, portions were HUGE. Bread was amazing. Will definitely return. We had the linguini with clams, veal parm, and pasta bolognese"}
