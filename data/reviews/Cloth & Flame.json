{"text":"Matt and his team are amazing. We are a picky group where food is concerned and theirs was fantastic. Chef Aurore made an unforgettable meal that was elevated and thoughtful, yet approachable and unpretentious. From the tablescape to the delicious and creative welcome cocktail, the small details were beautifully attended to and made the evening very memorable. I truly hope everyone I know uses them so I have more opportunities to enjoy the fantastic experience they provide."}
{"text":"Seriously, this is THE BEST brunch experience I've ever had. I can't wait to try them for a dinner experience. We arrived to the beautiful desert and were greated with champagne. The actual food was filling and delicious. Definitely in the top 3 meals of my life. I think there were at least 4 courses and coffee/cocktail pairing with EACH course. The chef came out to briefly explain the food with each course and the coffee folks from cartel coffee briefly explained each drink. The workers were so kind and accommodating. This is sooooo much better than a typical dining experience. I mean you get to eat and drink surrounded by huge saguaros. LOVE LOVE LOVE this dining concept and the people behind it."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity and pleasure of attending Cloth & Flame's Dinner in the Desert on January 21st. What an amazing event. Such a unique concept. The group of diners meet up at Cloth and Flames offices near the Deer Valley Airport. Coffee and cookies were available while waiting for everyone to arrive before loading into vans and heading out to the desert.   Once you arrive at the dining location in the desert there was a small bar where a mixologist was making drinks. Time was given for everyone to meet and get to know who they would be dining with. This dinner was prepared by Stephen Jones. Every Dish of the 5 course meal he prepared was amazing. Each dinner show cases a different local chef and all the food was locally sourced directly from different farms.   Cloth & Flame definitely has a homerun on there hands with this concept. If you have been to one of their dinners you know what I mean. If you haven't, what are you waiting for? Do whatever you have to do to get there. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A dear friend booked Cloth and Flame for her husbands 50th B-day. We were super excited as We'd noted the busines some time ago and were keenly interested in attending this dinner concept. The group met at the 'meeting spot' we all loaded up in the event provided passenger vans and were transported to a location in the nearby desert. Cloth and Flame had a drink table set up to serve appetizers, drinks and wine, complete with their 'signature' Cider Moscow mule,- with a tasty snappy ginger-bite on the back end. The appetizer was artesian bread, fire roasted pears, and manchego cheese, topped with baby arugula and drizzled with a swMIeet reduction sauce. 1st course-  Medjool dates, with goat cheese, baby arugula, pomegranate vinaigrette served on artesian toasted bread slices. 2nd course- Crab cakes with guac/avocado celeriac slaw. 3rd course Grilled NY strip with Irish potato mash with red wine reduction. Desert- Chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting. The meal was....incredible! The ambiance they create out in the desert, with ceder picnic tables and white Christmas lights overhead is superb. Not to be missed!!!!"}
{"text":"Cloth & Flame hosted our wedding in May at Slide Rock State Park in Sedona. The whole experience was magic. Olivia & Matt are incredibly kind, generous, creative people, and what they are doing in Arizona to highlight the natural beauty and bounty of the state is so important and beautiful. They created an amazing four course meal for us that easily accommodated all the dietary restrictions of our 90 guests, transformed a state park into an intimate dinner party venue, and orchestrated everything so seamlessly that everyone (including me!) was able to simply relax and enjoy the stunning night. They aren't a typical wedding planning company, but if what you're looking for is the best dinner party ever with all the people you love around you and no unnecessary ruffles, Cloth & Flame are it. (Also, they are WAY MORE REASONABLE than any traditional wedding venue.) Arizona is lucky to have them."}
{"text":"This is one company that will definitely go the distance. Myself and my wife attended an event on their 11 month in business for her surprise birthday party. The service, atmosphere and food were all amazing and deserve a 10 star review. We will definitely be attending future events and will be telling everyone about them. PS they also do events for companies, weddings and offer hot air ballon services from their other company."}
{"text":"I attended Cloth & Flame's New Years Eve dinner and had an amazing time! It was such a unique (and delicious) experience.  We fist gathered at the meeting point in North Phoenix where we met the owners and other staff, as well as our dining companions. Everyone working was super friendly. They then transported us in vans out the the desert. Everything was set up and waiting for us- just beautiful! See pictures...  We kicked things off with some tasty finger food- the stuffed dates were too good- and a champagne cocktail demonstration. The syrup they used in the cocktail was made by a local chef and was awesome.  We sat at the table as the sun was setting. It was just a little chilly, but the heat lamps and blankets they provided made it more than cozy. Each course was served family style and was presented and explained by the chef. Red and white wine poured freely. I really enjoyed the southwest feel to the flavors and their use of local ingredients.  I can honestly say I've never had an experience quite like this. I loved being able to enjoy a five star meal in pristine nature. They thought of all the details and made our New Years Eve really special.  I highly recommend checking out what events they have lined up on their website. It's perfect for someone visiting the area looking for a unique desert experience, or for locals looking for something new and enjoy supporting small local businesses!"}
{"text":"Incredible experience! Food and wine pairings, service, setting...amazing! The sweet couple and their teams who deliver these events are outstanding individuals. Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the best experiences you could have.The atmosphere,company and hosts were superb. Would recommend and will attend again!"}
{"text":"We got gift certificates as wedding presents. The location was beautiful, the food was pretty good without anything being particularly memorable, the hosts were great. Wine was flowing all evening, and the fee is all inclusive, even gratuity. The experience is similar to going to a wedding where you don't know anyone. You're supposed to socialize with strangers, it's not a romantic date night alone with your SO. We got lucky and enjoyed the company of the couples close to us, but 2.5 hours sitting and doing small talk can be a bit... exhausting."}
{"text":"Attended the Friendsgiving dinner on November 18th and had the absolute best time! This is a total experience, so much more than dinner, and 10000% worth the price!   We were taken in vans from the meet up spot at pleasant valley airport for about a 10 minute ride to a secluded area where a mobile kitchen and a beautifully set, long, communal table were waiting. We were greeted with unlimited cocktails and appetizers and plenty of time to check everything out, take pictures, and mingle.   The dinner was three courses served family style followed by individual desserts. Everything was spectacular! There was red and white wine available throughout the dinner and we were even encouraged to grab a bottle to go at the end of the night, which we happily did!   Everybody that we met there was super nice and there was a lot of interesting conversation around the table. The staff was sooooo awesome and they were all eager to ensure that everyone there was happy. They even handed out blankets when it started to get kind of chilly!!"}
{"text":"This is one fancy picnic you don't want to miss out on. I must say that having dinner out by one of my favorite trails, The Peralta Trail, was such a treat! I loved having the Superstition Mountains as the backdrop for our dinner. It was breath taking. Although we had great company with us, I was often distracted by the views. The owners of Quarter Circle U Ranch were gracious to have Cloth and Flame host their dinner there, so we had to unique opportunity to see what other visitors don't get to see.   My husband and I met Chuck Backus at this dinner and we learned a lot about gold mining history as well as some movies that were filmed in the area. We had no idea we would be learning so much history that evening so it was just an extra perk to our beautiful dinner! Chuck and his wife bought the ranch in 1977 if I remember correctly. My husband loved hearing about the Lost Dutchman gold mining hunts, since we sometimes watch that show about the \"Lost Dutchman gold\" on the History Channel. This brings me to the fact that you will meet a lot of awesome people at this dinner. It's community style dining, so whether you like it or not, you will be seated next to people you may not know. The best part about this is that the people who go to Cloth and Flame are adventurous foodies just like my husband and I so you will most likely connect with people with similar interests!   Now to the actual food! French onion caramelized tart - This was a tasty appetizer that did taste like French onion soup but obviously not soup since it was a tart. This was served as people were driving in and arriving at the ranch.  Curly kale salad with pickled beets - Very refreshing and the pickled beets were probably some of the best I've had! The Cardamon candied pecans were very dessert like and complemented the pickled beets well.  Kaboucha squash risotto - This buttery risotto had cauliflower and roasted carrots. Not only was this dish colorful, but it was also rich, creamy and everything a risotto should be!  Red wine braised short ribs - Served with artichoke, spinach and red cabbage. These ribs as expected were very tender and tasty.  Chocolate pot de creme - I was concerned because believe or not, I'm not the biggest chocolate fan, but this dessert was amazing!!! It reminded me of a panna cotta  or pudding dessert with a light chocolate essence. It was topped with fresh fruit.  With the exception of individualized desserts, the rest of the entrees were served family style on a platter and passed around the table. 4-6 people at a time would share a platter, so you could imagine there were soooo many platters across the long table.  The owners, Matt and Olivia, have turned their dreams into reality. They have future plans of expanding into some unique areas of glamping too in unique locations, not just Cloth and Flame dinners anymore! I challenge you to go to one of these dinners just so you can experience what we did! It's more than just eating dinner. It's all about atmosphere, community and learning and finding ways to preserve what's beautiful in nature!"}
{"text":"Cloth & Flame dinners are magical! I first read about them on the AZ Foodie blog and have been hoping to find a date and menu that were a good fit. As luck would have it, I purchased tickets to their last dinner of the season for my visiting family on Mother's Day weekend. The setting, in the Agritopia orchards, was beautiful. Long cedar tables, lovely tablescape, white lights strung from the trees. The hosts welcomed us like friends and chatting with other guests in attendance seemed natural even without the cute conversation starters on our plates.  The food was prepared in an outdoor kitchen and was AMAZING! Five courses served family style were as a pretty as they were tasty. We were welcomed with a fabulous peach sangria and had some time to just relax and enjoy one of the last cool evenings of the season. The roasted yellow beets with a yogurt sauce set out upon arrival were a nice light bite. Once seated, we passed down bowls of black bean/corn/quinoa salad with cilantro blossoms. I had no idea you could eat the blossom! I don't typically drink rose, but really enjoyed the local bottle that was offered with dinner. The patatas bravas were unlike ones I've had in tapas bars, but they were delish- roasted and coated in a nice spicy seasoning. The main course was steak. I don't eat much meat, so gave my portion to dad, but LOVED the farro salad with orange slices that it was served over. Dessert was an incredible butter cake with peaches that had been pulled from the trees overhead just hours before.  My whole family said multiple times how much they enjoyed the evening. I can't recommend this place enough and look forward to the return of cooler weather when they'll start hosting events in our community again."}

{"text":"Cloth and Flame put on a spectacular Friendsgiving dinner. My girlfriend and I attended and had high hopes for the night, but let me tell you our expectations were far exceeded and we have been raving about the meal since it happened (November 18, 2017). Our setting was at a desert spot in which we were bussed to from the Pleasant Valley Airport. The hosts were very friendly and the service was spectacular. Our meal started with bread, pears, beets, and cheese and continued with four more courses which included desert. At the beggining when we arrived at the desert location we were welcomed with cocktails and then proceeded to enjoy both red and white wine throughout dinner (unlimited drinks). Everyone that attended was very friendly and seemed to enjoy a common mindset of adventurousness. Although slightly on the pricey side for two, I think that the meal was worth every penny for a 5 course meal with unlimited drinks in a desert setting. I would certainly say that the experience itself was priceless."}
{"text":"This experience was absolutely amazing! My husband and I attended the Valentine's Day Dinner in the Desert, and even though it was rainy, I wouldn't have traded it for any other Valentine's dinner.   When we parked, we got into a passenger van for a 5 minute drive to the dinner sight. There was a beautiful table set for 75 people complete with a lit tent and heaters. Upon arrival, we were offered a welcome cocktail and appetizer. The menu was fantastic, and the food was cooked onsite, not transported from a kitchen! The outdoor kitchen was a great thing to see. We are avid campers and love to cook from scratch when camping.  The executive chef and her sous/pastry chef really did a phenomenal job. The entire crew made the evening magical, and the company of the other couples made for great conversation."}
