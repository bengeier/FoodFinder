{"text":"Came here late at night for quick dinner when we flew into Phoenix.  We ordered appetizers - original chicken wings, mussels and fresh spring rolls... all tasted really good especially sauce on wings and mussels! The owner is very nice and gave us great tips where to go for good restaurants. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Their Ribeye Pho was absolutely delicious!! The noodles were so tender, the beef was also tender and flavorful which only adds that much more flavor to the broth."}
{"text":"Came here because it was on the \"new & hot\" list. Bad choice !!!! They have been open for 2 weeks and the owner has never ran a restaurant. I did love the ambiance, but that went away quickly when the owner came over to take our order.  We asked for a drink menu because we saw pics of some awesome looking drinks on yelp. The owner told us we had to walk up to the bar and order because he had no idea of what they serve.  I showed him the pic and he said \"s@#t, I don't know what that is! I'm buzzing right now myself!\" WOW!!! It was kinda like watching a train wreck and I couldn't leave. It took 30 mins to get a cocktail and another 45 mins to get our food! Hope they get a clue and educate themselves on how to run a restaurant or close their doors. I saw so many people coming in not knowing what they had gotten themselves into for the evening."}
{"text":"These guys are great, was there last Friday and will be back this Friday looking for that great Pho and skewers!"}
{"text":"Really great place! Tried the Grilled beef and shrimp noodles! Super delicious! Good happy hour! Friendly owners! Found myself a new spot!"}
{"text":"I popped in on my way home yesterday afternoon and tried the Pho Special!  It was SO Good - even on 98 degree day!  Added in some Grilled Squid and Spring Rolls - it was perfect!!  The Ginger Sauce with the Squid is spicy, spicy good!  Can't beat the Happy Hour and Lunch Time prices! If you've driven by and haven't stopped in yet - you SHOULD!!"}
{"text":"Terrific pho and great rice plates. Live music and videos in the background. The rice noodles were exceptional. We will return."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and was not disappointed! We got the pork belly skewers, shrimp rolls, and wings. Everything was seasoned perfectly and super cheap on happy hour. The cocktail was great as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience. From the entrance to the exit. I walked in with my buddy, both of us craving authentic Vietnamese cuisine.   We both ordered the Pho Tai, with beef.   The Pho arrived in two enormous bowls, with fresh greens served on the side in a generous amount as well.   The broth was phenomenal. The owner explained that they simmer the broth for 24 hours to get the perfect mix of flavors-and I could tell he wasn't lying!   The beef fell apart in my mouth. Traditionally, Pho beef is tender but this was on a whole new level. It felt like Wagyu, and was buttery, tender, and absolutely bursting with flavor. The noodles were perfectly cooked, and had absorbed the aroma and taste of the surrounding broth very well.  The owner walked out and chatted with us during our meal, which was incredibly enjoyable. I could see the passion in his eyes about his business, and could tell he it committed to making each and every customer leave with a smile.   This fantastic gem is my favorite Thai restaurant, and I will most certainly be back for their fresh, original, and delicious foods, as well as their delightful atmosphere of humility and kindness."}
{"text":"This place is great! The atmosphere is elegant - great date place! The food was so good and at a decent price. I had the noodles with beef, shrimp and egg roll, and it was divine. The prices are fair especially for the meat and seafood quality (so good). They have a good selection of beer, but I opted for their delicious Vietnamese coffee. The staff was so kind and welcoming. Everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"They're recently grand open and we went there last night. Excellent Pho and grill food, one of my most favorite Pho in Arizona. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here with high expectations, but we were let down. To start, I inquired about the happy hour specials, which I saw a picture of on Yelp. The server looked at me funny and said that it was from their \"old\" menu. I found this funny, because this place supposedly just opened and the picture that I saw was posted on yelp only 4 days prior to my visit.   Then there was the server, the guy looked as if he was high or  maybe he just had pink eye that day. I don't know, but he could have seriously used some eye drops. Also, he was not polite in any way. Both my friend and I thanked him a couple of times when he served us our food, but he just walked away. As we were leaving the restaurant, he asked us to leave a good yelp review and then proceeded to tell us, \"you better not give us a bad review\".   And finally the prices, $11.50 for a bowl of Pho and $12.00 for a rice plate? Seriously? To the owners, do you not know your location? Gesh, even Pho in California isn't this expensive. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but not great and it definitely wasn't worth $11.50 or $12.00. Not to mention, the basil and sprouts that came with the pho was sad. It was dead and the peppers were frozen.   Honestly, if I wanted bad service, I would have went to Pho Thanh. At least they have good and reasonable priced food. Sorry, but I can't recommend this to anybody. Two stars only because the food was good enough and the restaurant was clean/nice."}
{"text":"The pho here is soooo delicious!!! It's the best pho I had in town so far. I got the pho special, the broth was so savory and the beef was so fresh. I also ordered Vietnamese coffee, shrimp roll and egg roll appetizers. Food was pretty amazing!  Good atmosphere. Servers were friendly and good too.   They play music and there's a bar. I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Please! Improve the service. Came here Thursday night for music, which was FABULOUS! But more staff is needed. Up the service and keep the music nights this place will be great!"}
{"text":"On vacation from the Bay Area and I was craving was craving Asian food so I came here to give it a try. One of the first customers since it just opened! I got the SIZZLING STEAK & EGG. It was so good and savory, definitely made me feel like I was back at home."}
{"text":"Meh... Presentation was the best part of the meal.  There's something missing from the experience and I think it's coziness and ambiance. It's new and nice, excellent liquor selections available. We had the grilled squid, pho, and shaken beef salad. Squid was very plain, ginger fish sauce was a definite need to dress it up. Pho was cloudy for some reason. Salad was excellent and we ate the whole thing.  It's tough because no one wants a $40-50 lunch to get just alright.  They are new to the area so I hope they go through their growing pains and figure out what works best."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Snuck in at the end of Happy Hour. A must try. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"So many great things to say about this place. I read some of the bad reviews and they are honestly ridiculous. My husband and I eat Pho all over the valley. Let me tell you, the Pho broth here is by far the most flavorful I have tasted anywhere. You can compare the size and price of the Pho to other places, but you get what you pay for. If you want flavorful broth, no msg, and fresh meat, get the Pho special.  Jay and Judy (the owners) are the most kind and friendly people you'll meet. They have such a love for their restaurant and it shows. If you need more basil or cilantro for your pho, just ask and they will not hesitate to bring you more for free. It's better than them putting out a ton of the greens and having to throw it away when you don't use it. Why waste food?  Other than the Pho I would recommend the appetizer wings. They are amazing. The sizzling cheesy corn is to die for! The skewers are delightful as well. I recommend the frog legs which are super tender and taste amazing."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and use Yelp to find unique places. This restaurant showed up on my list for the first time, and I'm definitely coming back. The pho was fresh with deep flavor, and the pork belly skewer was.  .   Wow,  I could have made a whole meal of those!"}
{"text":"It was Just OK. Nothing about it makes me want to return.  I don't have anything really good or bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"The very tasty shaking beef salad was a great introduction to this restaurant, as were the very fresh-tasting and tender spring  rolls. On another visit I tried the classic pho ga and found the flavors very authentic. That was a relief because my reservation about \"fusion\" Asian cuisine is that the deviation from the original flavor combinations might be too great, but thankfully that was not the case with this dish. The chicken gizzard skewers were very flavorful as well and a nice change from the usual appetizers served in Asian dining places. The staff is very friendly, the restaurant itself is very clean and has a nice relaxed atmosphere, and location is great - in the commercial complex at the southwest corner of Thunderbird and 7th Street in north Phoenix, next to the North Mountain Preserve."}
{"text":"Place is bomb.  I had the Pho special and the wings. Great customer service and the managers are cool."}
{"text":"Great Place and People. The food is outstanding... When the Credit card charges came in it says Candys Kitchen? VEry confusing... It lists the same adress... I know this was North Mountain Grill before  SO ???"}
{"text":"This a great place to enjoy Vietnamese food and have drink too. The service was great. I would recommend the chicken and shrimp vermicelli noodles."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled beef and shrimp rice plate and a kids sized chicken pho. I think they forgot the bowl of beef soup that was supposed to come with rice plate but the quality was good and everything tasted very fresh! All of this was $20 so not bad! The happy hour menu looked awesome too. I will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"CreAsian is fantastic!  I recommend the sizzling steak, the pho ga, and the chicken and shrimp rice plate.  The egg rolls are also fantastic!  For dessert I recommend the fried banana!  It was wonderful!  The decor is modern, but comfortable.  The owner is very personable and tries very hard to make sure all customers are happy.  The waitstaff are attentive and very professional.  It's wonderful to have CreAsian in the Moon Valley neighborhood!  Five stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in AZ and I was craving Vietnamese food. Although there were a ton of options in Phoenix, this place definitely lives up to it's 5-star rating & is the only highlight from AZ! Came here multiple times during my trip so that says a lot lol.  Their pho broth is amazing & I can honestly say it's the best I've had. It's super flavorful and they aren't shady with the meat/noodle portions.  Everything I ordered on the menu was really good, but I'd definitely recommend their pho special, spring rolls, sizzling salmon or steak and eggs rice plate, and chicken wings.   Amazing happy hour deals, so you can have a cocktail/beer/wine with your meal since it's a bar as well! This is definitely not your traditional, noisy Vietnamese restaurant with shitty service. Their exceptional service and upscale decor & ambiance is what makes them stand out from other competitors."}
{"text":"We were here at happy hour. Very good!!!  We had the salmon. Sooo good. The grilled corn is a must for an appetizer!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great addition to our neighborhood. My husband said it was the best pho he has had in Phoenix. I tried the starter boar ribs, and despite not having meat like typical rib places, it is very much the crunchy Asian style I like. The egg rolls are awesome Vietnamese style. By the time I was done with all the appetizers, I ordered a small pho which was perfect. My friend has tried everything on the menu and does lunch take-out for work. I have some catching up to do!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service and the food is very tasty! You have to try the Asian sweet and tangy wings are slowly baked n basted not fried!! If you're into Pho it's exquisite! For the adventurous types like me, they have some Great out the box stuff like skewered rabbit and goat. It's in my neck of the woods and I wouldn't hesitate to become a regular here."}
{"text":"A spark to the area. Great vibe inside (numerous TVs and a nice bar). Outdoor patio is great as well. The service was awesome, the owner, jay, is great. I got the vermicelli bowl and Vietnamese coffee, both were spectacular. I will be back soon for pho.    *** they have an awesome happy hour. Half off drinks, $5 apps, and $3 skewers of a variety of meats. Really excited to have this place nearby."}
{"text":"Very nice people. Food was excellent. service great. they seemed to be comming off a happy hour rush.  recomended a beer for my wife she loved it. the food came out quickly and hot the tast was better than any asian in moonvalley area. Will be back."}
{"text":"I just left CreAsian. I'd like to begin by saying that Judy and Jay are friendly. I truly liked them.  As for the experience...I am in shock. I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants, but tonight... I am in shock. The special was Wild Boar Ribs. They are $6.00, but the happy hour price (which I paid) was less than that. The first clue that something was wrong was when the waiter (OWNER) brought them out to us and said, \"Oh, the boars are very small.\" He sat down a small plate with 6 bones, completely bare. I kid you not, there was more bone showing that ANY meat, and the pieces of meat that were showing were like cilia clinging to an emaciated cell. There was NOTHING from the bone that was edible. I did try. I put the bone in my mouth and tried to scalp it with my teeth in hopes of finding something satiating. NO. My attempts were fruitless. Please, keep in mind that these are regularly priced, as a special, at $6. My son ordered the Vietnamese chicken wings. They were GREAT!!! We ordered these with the intention of sharing, but. . . my son is 16, so I only had one of his wings.   We also ordered two skewers of goat. They were tasty (thanks, SAUCE). Extremely tough, but tasty. And very small. So, one of the owners tried to encourage us to buy more, so I did... I mean, I was hungry!! He asked if we had tried the rabbit skewers. I  was interested, so I said, \"We'll take an order of those!\" OH....MY....DEAR....LORD!!!!!!! He brought out THREE pieces of meat (the size and width of a quarter) and placed it in front of me. \"Hmm...,\" I thought. I ate one; it was tough, but there was a dipping sauce, so it was palatable. My son wanted one (of course), so I gave him the next one, hoping to savor the last. I pulled the final piece off the skewer, popped it in my mouth, and CRRRAAACCCKKKK!!!  It was pure bone. What I put in my mouth was a piece of bone covered in sauce. I was aghast! I tried to find meat on it, but the attempt culminated in my spitting out 6 cracked pieces of bone! I didn't get one iota of meat. The owner who suggested them asked how they were. I told him about all the bones and pointed to the bones piled on the plate. He said, \"Oh. The wings were good, though?\"  That was it. Yea, the wings were good. NOTHING else was.   So, what do I think? Well, I paid $34 (plus 20% tip) and I haven't eaten. That's fairly inexpensive considering I had two $5 well drinks (they were 50% off so apparently they are $10 when it isn't happy hour [NOT WORTH IT]). But I'm just flabbergasted at this experience. My teeth on one side STILL hurt from my crunching unknowingly on pure bone. This was the worst meal I have ever had. These owners should be embarrassed.  I'm so glad I was in a good mood when I got there, or they would get ONE star. I have to give a star based on the potential and friendliness of the owners. But, they need to get it together, because this place is a joke.  I want this Moon Valley restaurant with nice owners to be successful. They MUST make some changes. Take those hideous boar bones OFF the menu. You're just embarrassing yourselves. Also, do NOT serve rabbit bones and try to pass them off as meat. That really ticked me off.   They will never win over Moon Valley with such horrible food. Moon Valley Residents-- PLEASE don't settle for this. Insist that they serve genuine skewers and ribs. This was NOT a good example of Vietnamese cuisine.   Goat skewers should NOT equal the texture of jerky; wild boar ribs should NOT look like bony witch's fingers; rabbit skewers should NOT replicate eating the burnt turkey from the movie Christmas Vacation!"}
{"text":"Being around this cuisine for over 30 years and my wife all her life we have been in Pho restaurants throughout the valley, Colorado and California. Only about one out of every five are descent, one out of every hundred are good and places that mimic true authentic deliciousness like my wife and her mother made, one in a thousand.  CreAsians' food is better than descent and almost good with the exception of these things: First I ordered hot tea. What's your expectation? Mine is a single asian teacup and saucer and a hot teapot with Jasmine tea in it. Instead I got a bar glass too hot to handle with a Lipton teabag in it. That's minus one star. Authenticity almost fell out the door. Second, the food and the atmosphere were both excessive. The atmosphere was just too posh for Pho. And the Pho was WAY too pricey. No matter how elegant the restaurant people who know Pho won't pay $10 to $11.50 per bowl for it. That's another star shot down. You can find what every Pho lover wants. Just not here."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho, it is some of the best I have had outside Asia.  Spring rolls are very well made, calamari is very tasty, and the wings are well above average.  Love this place, have been here 7 times now."}
{"text":"Who knew I would find a great steak at Asian restaurant?  Steak was most reviewed menu item here according to Yelp and I had to try... pleasantly surprised how good the steak was!  Rice and steak goes very well.   Spring rolls appetizer was also tasty.  Service was excellent. They weren't that busy during lunch time when I went.   They have good happy hour menu and full bar is available, I would like to come back here for happy hour soon."}
{"text":"Cre Asian has now opened ! As a vendor , I was asked to try their PHO soup before they opened . I got the PHO special . It was incredible . Bunch of flavor in the soup . I added the 2 sauces that they provided  which gave it a nice sweet kick . I came back for lunch today and got the chicken pho ... go get some ! You won't be disappointed. I look forward to the rest of the menu . The ambiance works well . The added ivory table cloths with black linen napkins are a plus . Full bar . Happy hour daily ."}
{"text":"So I flew into PHX and was looking for something to eat. I always love some good pho. Creasian looked good with good pho review so I headed over. Good service ordered pho special. Came quickly but was not up to usual standards. I would call it Americanized pho with a not much backbone. It has decent noodles but the meat was a little weak. Overall rating of fair to Midland"}
{"text":"The Food is Amazing!! Great prices and right in my neighborhood! We went 2 nights in a row!"}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food and really wanted to love this place but the service is hit or miss. The first time I stopped in, the owner took our order and made sure everything was perfect. The food was delicious and I knew I would be back. I then decided to order takeout and it was a nightmare. I placed my order ahead and picked up on time -- the food was cold. The order was also messed up, which I noticed before I drove away. I went back in to bring up the issue and only half of my order was fixed. Since the employee working was so rude, I decided it wasn't worth asking them to fix it for the second time. While my first impression was great, I will not be back because of the takeout experience."}
{"text":"This new place is in a pretty nondescript strip mall. But what a find it is. They have all these exotic meats like ostrich, Gator, wild boar, even crazier stuff than that basically anything you can think of that they probably have.  I'll have to try all of that the next time I was there. I came in for lunch and at spring rolls and the pho with everything in it and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Great little Vietnamese Asian restaurant in Moon Valley. So excited to have a neighborhood joint like this. We ordered  the chicken and shrimp rice plate, ribeye pho, and the beef and egg plate. All of it was fresh and tasty. Why only 4 stars? I was hopping to see more fresh herbs to put in my pho like coriander, holy basil, and mint. Also, while they have Vietnamese coffee, I was really craving milk tea with boba, which I didn't see that on the menu. Still, overall great place."}
{"text":"The Pho is delicious. The Steak and Egg was fantastic. Service was fast and staff was very friendly. The restaurant is gorgeous"}
{"text":"Took my daughter out to lunch today. We ordered the spring rolls which are listed to come with mint. They came with shrimp and pork. The shrimp had dirty poopy veins. The Romain lettuce was very warm almost hot. I asked for chili sauce and soy sauce to dip my rolls in and they did not have that available. No herbs for the rolls. The service was really lacking. A bunch of small children running around climbing all over the booths...  looked to be maybe the servers children or owners children? The Pho bowl  was pretty tasty. I was looking for some tea or coffee but ended up with a glass full of coffee grounds :(       asked for a refill on water and ended up with a cup full of warm tapwater.We will give it another try but not too impressed."}
{"text":"The good and the bad - you have to know what to order.  Tried CreAsian this week since they are one of the few Vietnamese places that work with Uber Eats in my area. The Pho isn't bad flavor wise, but mine was sent without fresh Thai basil on the side (requisite component!), lemon instead of lime (unacceptable), and came with not nearly enough Sriracha. May have just caught them on a bad night with regard to available supplies, but that is no way to serve Pho. Luckily, I had the items needed to save the dish already here at the house. I was able to make it into a good bowl of soup, which means that the core ingredients in the broth were decent.   Whatever you do, avoid the Shaking Beef Salad Bo Luc Lac. The beef is very chewy and not flavorful. It's supposed to be served with tomatoes and cucumber - had neither. Came with a plethora of red and yellow bell pepper instead... WAY too much. The salad dressing it came with was disappointing. Overall, a big miss.   I do recommend the Grilled Pork, Shrimp and Egg Roll Vermicelli Noodle Bowl however. (Although it was also missing the cucumber as advertised.) The egg rolls were not crispy and tasted stale, but if you just toss those, you've got a good dish. The pork was grilled to perfection, flavorful, tender, and delicious. The shrimp was just OK - I might skip that next time, and order extra pork. The greens are fresh and crisp, and the dressing divine.   If CreAsian can bring its Pho sides game up to spec, I'd recommend this restaurant highly, just based on the grilled pork."}
{"text":"I really like ?this place.  The food is well prepared and interesting.  They have a way of presenting Vietnamese?e basics without stretching it out over 10 menu pages.  They also have creative meats that I will never eat, like alligator, kangaroo, yak, frog legs and rabbit.  Portions are not tremendously oversized, and prices are competitive? with other trendy fusion places downtown and in Scottsdale. In my eyes, that is not necessarily a good thing.   The location is at least 15 miles away from the ?entertainment districts and  7 miles from more densely populated high-income? residential areas where a $20 dinner is the norm rather than a treat.  The result is an expensive dinner at a neighborhood place.  I'll return ?because the food is well prepared and of good quality, but I won't be a weekly customer.  If I'm not there to meet friends for happy hour first, I'll go to one of a few other places that come to mind quickly where I can purchase the same meal for about $7-$10."}
{"text":"We really fell gor this new place in our neighborhood with delicious food, great service and ambiance! We look forward to returning soon to taste the many other items on the menu. We both enjoyed the pho and appetizers!!! We recommend this new restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and have tried this restaurant a couple of times.  The beef pho noodle soup and the barbecue pork vermicelli are excellent. We have been there for lunch but the owner was encouraging us to come back for their happy hour which has some beverage and food specials.    Plan to go back soon to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"We had our first visit to CreAsian....wow, we will definitely be back for many more visits! Lovely,  friendly owners.....they make wonderful spring rolls with delicious dipping sauces, for starters. I ordered the Sizzling Salmon. It comes out on a sizzling cast iron skillet with delicious slivers of grilled onion. Add in some fresh spring greens on the side, along with THE BEST FRIED RICE I'VE EVER HAD! My husband had the Sizzling Steak and Egg. He moaned and groaned, it was so good. Perfect char on the steak! Mellow, nice atmosphere. Very clean. Fast service. Pricing is reasonable for the caliber of meal we received. It was my husband's birthday and we finished off our meal by sharing a fried banana with vanilla ice cream. SO GOOD! Like I said, we'll be back!! Thank you Jay and Judith!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Very nice, casual but upscale, restaurant serving fresh and flavorful Asian fusion cuisine. Friendly and fast staff. Nice touches like cloth table linens. We ordered the pho (delicious) and the rice plate with chicken which included beef broth, salad, flavorful slices chicken breast, small spring roll, a couple grilled shrimp, and choice of white or fried rice. Everything was fresh and very tasty. We are hoping this cute little place stays for a long while."}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff super friendly ! I realy enjoyed the teriyaki salmon and trying out the boar ! I truly recommend this place. Only con is small menu !"}
{"text":"Delicious food and good drinks! Kind of wish the portions were bigger, but because the food was so good! Love that there's finally a yummy restaurant nearby:)"}
{"text":"Got the Pho Special and some appetizers . Delicious.  Will be back to try more. The rest of their family enjoyed their meals too.  They enjoyed their salmon and steak and eggs."}
{"text":"Amazing take on classic Vietnamese cuisine.  Not your regular \"pho\".  The owners are amazing and the food has that extra special flavor.  Worth a try!"}
{"text":"I unfortunately didn't really care for CreAsian. The Pho and wings were really good but everything else was just okay. And if it weren't for my friend ordering the wings, I wouldn't have ever ordered wings at an Asian place.   So let's begin with appetizers: As I mentioned above we ordered the wings and they didn't come with any sauce. The sauce they were tossed in was a little like honey-hot. They were nice and crispy yet small. I also ordered the spring rolls and they came with a peanut sauce.. again they were Okay.   For an entree my bff ordered he ribeye Pho and I opted for the shrimp and chicken fried rice. Like i said, Pho was amazing hands down.. she loved every bit of it and I actually ordered one to go for my boyfriend. Yum.   However the rice dish was very much unexpected and underwhelming. The fried rice tasted like it was mushy and from the bottom of the pot. Served with large leafy greens(definitely ask for a knife), two pieces of shrimp and sliced chicken. Everything was served separately on the plate so it wasn't technically \"chicken and shrimp rice\" it was a side of rice, a side of chicken, a side of salad, a side of shrimp and an egg roll... oh and they don't serve with the side of soup like the menu says. *update your menu people* I wouldn't get this again because everything had different flavors and I think my palette was confused lol.   Anyway.. other than the food, the ambiance was nice but I also thought it was odd that there was only one server for the whole place. Granted there were only like 15 customers but she did a decent job anyway.   Definitely give it a shot for yourself if you're a pho lover."}
{"text":"There aren't many places that attract my attention with catchy names, but this place is witty. My husband and I wanted to celebrate dinner with a promotion and the first check I received on the job so we decided to check this place out, \"no pun intended\". Although happy hour ended at 6pm, were still surprised with the drink prices and appetizers. My husband ordered the salmon with fried rice and I ordered the steak that comes with a side of egg \"over medium\" and rice. It was delicious! Medium rare and side of steam rice to boot combination is always a winner. When we asked what the connection is with egg and steak for dinner the cook said, \"that's how we eat, with egg\" \"but even at night though?\". Regardless, morning, noon or night the steak with egg (one egg) was on point.  Washed down with a bottle of red blend wine at a descent price an evening dinner is always a winner. Ricky, the brother of the chef Lin who is co-owner with his other brother that manages CreAsian II in Tempe, Arizona was amazing. Ricky, although young had a teachable spirit, quiet yet warming, still practices customer service and that's a miracle in this day and age with modern generations. Lin, the chef was originally bashful, but eventually his friendly personality came out after some persuading. When he started talking about the dishes one can understand why the unique choice of beef tongue was on the menu. The trademark of the brand of CreAsian is unique food, kangaroo, camel and I believe snake was on the menu at one time, but not often served here at the Moon Valley, \"I wonder why\". Originally, when they first opened up they had a cover band playing, \"Come Together\" but after several complaints of being too loud they stopped the entertainment again \"I wonder why\". The restaurant is wonderful and is well to do, the happy hour I've yet to try and hope to soon. I am not a big fan of the Pho but as an elite for Yelp, I hope to try it soon. Kudos to the family owned restaurant CreAsian hope to see you!"}
{"text":"Typical Vietnamese restaurant, but overpriced. Live music was too loud the night we went there. Food was good and good restaurant staff."}
{"text":"Was hoping for an amazing experience after seeing the reviews . I ordered the chicken pho for take out . For the price I was hoping for a decent size , but it seemed like they really skimped on the chicken and the toppings ... I'm one that really likes the basil and cilantro leaves and for once I had to go use my own stash . The broth wasn't anything to write home about . The chicken was super dry and rubbery . Maybe because it was Monday and slow it was an off night so I won't give up just yet , but please don't skimp ok the to go orders ."}
{"text":"We came to watch the SuperBowl here while on vacation nearby in Phoenix. This place is super close to the Pointe Hilton!  Seemed a little disjointed, perhaps because of the Super Bowl, but we had more than one server serving us at once. Sometimes, they would come by and ask the same question we just got asked. It was, dare I say, a little too much service.  They were out of spring rolls, so we got cheesy corn. The corn didn't come out as an app, but came out after our main course. Cheesy corn was a little too soaked in butter, not my style. An interesting concept, though!  I got the vermicelli noodle bowl, and it was really good! Fish sauce side wasn't as fresh and authentic as I've had at other restaurants--tasted a bit like canned sweet chili sauce. Pork was good!  My dad got beef and rice dish. He liked it! However, his egg rolls didn't taste overly fresh or homemade.   Workers were nice, but not the best Vietnamese I've had. Very convenient location, though!"}
{"text":"Their Pho is delicious! We sampled the appetizers, grilled salmon and pho this visit. Pricing is extremely reasonable for the quality, especially during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Live band, pho, chicken wings, chicken hearts, gizzards, deer, alligators, camel, rabbit, goat etc. anything your heart desires lol. Gizzards and vodka, must try."}
{"text":"TEMPE LOCATION this place is so good! Their prices are so cheap! Their food is super good and exotic! Bacon wrapped quail eggs, wild boar ribs and simple but really good egg rolls!! Their pho is sooo good!!100/100!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Had the Rib Eye Pho and it was amazing!! Judy the owner was so sweet and her little daughter Hazel did a great job as our server!!"}
{"text":"We tried CreAsian after reading about it on NextDoor.  It exceeded expectations.  My husband had their special with a chicken leg with egg and fried rice. I had pho with chicken.  Both were fresh and delicious. The service was great, friendly and offered suggestions. Very attentive. Very clean and calming atmosphere. Nicely appointed bar. Will highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"Soft opening today.  1. Vietnamese Chicken Wings 2. Bacon wrapped quail eggs 3. House special pho 4. Vermicelli noodle bowl 5. Sizzling steak and egg 6. Sizzling teryaki salmon  Had to try most of the food on the menu. Food was very good and cooked to perfection.  Each and every item has a their own excellent flavor. I would definitely recommend this place and come back again. It taste like home cook meal. It was worth the drive here (30mins). We got 15% discounts as well."}
{"text":"Great new little Vietnamese restaurant just opened between our house & the bike trails we often ride...this is our second time eating here & we really loved it!   The Pho was great (my only complaint is that they should serve more vegetables/herbs with it). The broth was great, and no msg.  They also serve skewers of meat - small bites - which were fabulous. They happened to have goat & rabbit skewers as their special of the day so we tried it...both were great. But if you're not that adventurous, they have chicken, pork & beef! Served with a great sauce.  Tonite we're trying a few other dishes to work our way through the menu!  And just to make it even better, they have happy hour Monday-Friday 3-6 with half off wine, beer & drinks! We need to come back for that..."}
{"text":"This place gets many points for trying: trying to be innovative, trying to be friendly, and trying to be fun. First, let's talk innovative. They offer some interesting skewers. On the weekends those skewers include unique meats such as beaver, camel, antelope, alligator, and kangaroo, along with what seem less unique meats such as bison, elk, and venison. The big problem is that all the meats are cooks so similarly and only one dipping sauce is provided so outside of chewiness and occasional gaminess, they end up tasting the same. What did taste unique and was another of their innovative tries was a fabulous mango pudding. The only regular item from the menu we tried, the steak salad, was quite good. Next trying to be friendly. The people are responsive if you talk to them, especially the owner and his wife, but I fear they hold back unless prodded. For example, I had to ask for refills on our teas. Oh, your first Yelp check-in gives a 10% price break, but I didn't see it on my bill. Again, trying to be friendly but falling short. (The bill was so low, $61 after tax for 3 people that I let it slide, especially knowing that he had thrown in an extra desert.) Finally, trying to be fun. Televisions play endless rounds of what is supposed to be fun material, much of it built around pratfalls and stupidity. Not my cup of tea--perhaps yours--however the TVs are not synched so the skateboard fall on one occurs seconds later on the next. Very distracting. One thing I will say, if you want to appear cool when going out on a first date, this place on a weekend might be a great way to go. For me, at least I can now say I've eaten camel, beaver, etc. Too bad none of them stood out."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find! The salmon was fantastic, the short ribs are a definite do-again! We also tried the Pho and, yep, that was great too! Service was very friendly. We will be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The pho here is bomb! I came back again and tried the sizzling salmon, really good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! They have MOOCHI!!! Finally a great Vietnamese/Asian spot in the neighborhood!!!! Live music and an interesting menu...come check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy CreAsian bar and grill and I have eaten there about 10 times. They have a great happy hour from 2 PM to 6 PM. The appetizers are a dollar off and include skewered meats. I have had the chicken, the squid, and streak skewers. The squid skewers were rather tough and that is the only complaint I have.  As you can see on one of the photos they offer a variety of unusual meats.  I have attached a photo of the spring rolls that I am very fond of eating. The spring rolls with a fabulous peanut sauce fills me up for lunch.  That with a cup of hot tea is less than $10 and you can always use the 10% off discount Yelp offers us. The owners Ray and Judy own the restaurant and are very friendly.  There is an open bar. There is outdoor seating. It's child friendly. Wait until you see the artwork they feature in CreAsians! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & very trendy! They play hype music and have a cool light up pong table. The food was great as well, I liked the sweet spice in the sauce. This is a good place to come with a few friends to eat and then sit at the bar for some drinks and bp games. Overall it's chill and I will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Pho broth was great, corn app needed chips or bread with it, food is pretty good but chairs were so uncomfortable it made the experience a downer. Staff is friendly but a bit discombobulated."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is excellent. The place is really cool inside and very clean.  Great edition to Moon Valley Neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food is soooo good! The Chicken wings are meaty and moist. The Pho is outstanding, the drinks are poured perfectly and all the staff were super friendly and helpful when we had questions about the food 'how to's'."}
{"text":"This gem just opened in Moon Valley and I'm loving it because it's close to home and the other pho shops in the surrounding area are just terrible.  CreAsian opened with owners that came from the Bay area.  This is always a good sign as Californian's know their Vietnamese food!  The owners are very nice and visit the tables to check on you to make sure everything is going well.  Their steak and eggs with fried rice is probably one of my favorite dishes there.  We have also had their eggs rolls, spring rolls, fried chicken wings, cheesy corn, vermicelli noodles, rice dishes and pho.  The pho has a little to be left desired, but everything else has always been on-point.  Given their friendly staff and great food, I am hoping they will be around for a long time as it is needed in our area!"}
{"text":"CreAsian Bar and Grill  Came here on a Saturday evening around 8 pm and there was one table occupied outside and no one inside.  Had the Pho Special and Spring Rolls.  Pho Special had Vietnamese Rice Noodles in a Beef Bone Marrow Broth with Ribeye Steak, Brisket and Meatballs with Bok Choy and added Mint Leaves and Bean Sprouts. Bone broth is very good and all the condiments compliment the entire bowl.  The Spring Rolls had shrimp and an array of veggies inside accompanied with a peanut sauce. Order came with 4 rolls that were good size.  Food was good, a little on the expensive side for Vietnamese Pho compared to what we go to other restaurants.  Would like to try their Vermicelli or Rice Plates  Nice job on the food."}
