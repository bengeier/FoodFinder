{"text":"We were given tickets to see The Beach Boys on August 10 at Maddie's Place so we decided to 'make it a night' and have dinner at the restaurant which advertises on CJAD and for which announcers swoon over the roast beef.  We are all serious meat eaters and looked forward to a glorious meal. We made reservations and arrived on time to be seated.  We were never advised that on that night there would be no menu and only a buffet would be available so I am only reviewing the buffet.  I have no reference for the actual menu.  The food was truly awful!  The food was cold, overcooked and mostly not there!  The charge was $30 per person for cold pasta, dry cold ribs and some kind of overcooked beef swimming in a sea of something, certainly not jus.  The shrimp were okay, just okay. The main issue here seems to be management. When we complained on the Monday after the show the person who answered our email told us we had free tickets to the concert so we had a 'great night' for about $35 per person.  Whether we paid for our seats or not has nothing to do with the quality of the food.  Our meal was truly one of the worst buffets we have every frequented.  The combination of bad food and a manager who does not care encourages me to seek other restaurants to frequent. Again, perhaps the menu is wonderful, but we did not witness that on that particular visit."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was great too! I would recommend the seafood or the steak. It's all cooked to perfection! :)"}
{"text":"The 10oz NY strip loin was a good piece of meat. However, it lacked seasoning and smokiness. It tasted a bit bland overall. Decent steamed veggies side, but the mashed potato was way too heavy on the butter and garlic. It's alright. I've had better steaks.  Cool log cabin-like setting though and it wasn't busy. We also received a salami hors d'oeuvre on the house. As one of the hidden reviews mentioned, no GST/QST here and people do indeed smoke at the bar inside. Only commercial beers available."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3 stars based on tonight, but given that I've been here before, overall i think this place is a solid 4. We were originally guna spend the night at The Rail (but tho my friends called in advance for a reservation, were told not necessary, but yet when we arrived there were no tables) so after a call to Robbie's (which was also booked solid) we called Maddie's and got reservations for 8 ppl at 6:30pm on a Saturday night (week before Christmas). We were seated quickly but several other tables arrived almost simultaneously and we were asked to wait very respectfully by our awesome waiter Eric several times before our orders were actually taken (we didn't mind we were enjoying each other's company). The fun thing about Maddies is 1- you get to go pick ur own bottle of wine (which are of above-average prices) and 2- if you're a smoker: u get to smoke indoors. So getting on with it, service my gawd: amazing !! Last time me and t friends were served by Jeff (we loved Jeff he was a super awesome waiter no longer there -- if u know where he's gone please message me 'cuz we will go there!) This time we had Eric who was fantastic and soooooo charming! (And handsome ;) ) What an excellent waiter: he did awesome considering he was dealing with a staff, restaurant and stock that had had an unexpected surplus of clientele the previous night that had all but obliterated the quantity available of wines and foods making his job as a waiter most precarious. He didn't charge us for most of our sides and bought us a round of shots at the end, in return we tipped him quite merry Christmas generously but he did well in what he did because had it not been for him this place would have easily scored 2 stars tonight and we likely would never re-consider it for future outings despite having greatly enjoyed our last visit because of their lack of staff and lack of supplies making this visit so close to disastrous it was ONLY SAVED BY OUR WAITER- I cannot emphasize that enough. I had the Rib Roast beef, i ordered medium rare, it was a tad more on the rare side but i didn't complain because it was still phenomenal. Most of my friends who ordered beef of some cut had the same problem slightly more rare than medium rare, slightly more medium rare than medium but we all still enjoyed our plates. The carrots were unfortunately way under-cooked though and i did let them know. Overall our meal took 2.5 hours but we enjoyed it thoroughly. We will still be going back to this place again."}
