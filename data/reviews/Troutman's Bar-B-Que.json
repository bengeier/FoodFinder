{"text":"Well... I think peoples 1 star negative reviews are a bit too critical.  I mean what do you exactly expect to get for the price of the menu????  The pork bbq was not the best I've had but it wasn't \"tasteless\" as many described.  On a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 6.  Service wasn't bad.  Yes restaurants decor is sad and old.  I certainly get why it's popular with the senior citizens.  But it's just not a bad place for really cheap above average eats.   Did I mention CHEAP?"}
{"text":"The best thing that I can say about this place is that it is apparently the only local eatery open past 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon.  My guess is that this was once a good place to eat and probably a favorite still of some old-timers, but the food is nothing to write home about if you're not \"from around here.\"  The cost was very reasonable, $6.95 for a meat and two sides plus a \"free\" desert - but the food itself was bland and most likely frozen or canned.  The staff was very friendly though and the service quick.   Next trip to Concord we will definitely plan lunch earlier in the day and try someplace else."}
{"text":"I have to defend this establishment!  I grew up eating Troutman's BBQ and every time my family brings me down to visit we eat at Troutman's at least twice.  Because it's outrageously cheap and probably not nourishing at all, but eating and loving Troutmans BBQ is part of living in Concord. Where else can you get a $2.75 fried chicken sandwich with tomatoes and lettuce!?  I'm sorry, I look foward to that greasy goodness with a side of fried okra and fried squash every chance I get (ok, which isn't often...like 4 times a year!).  My husband was raised outside Concord and was appalled that such \"crap food\" (as he calls it) could be one of my favorite places to visit.  I also happened to have my baby shower there, and my wedding shower because they have lovely meeting rooms in the back of the restaurant with yummy catered food.    There are probably better places to eat good BBQ in NC, but for $3/tray?  Probably not.  It's cheap, yes.  But it's worth it, I love eating there!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  Moved to the area a few years ago and have tried this joint multiple times now thinking they had an \"off\" day -but no, it just sucks.  Today, I arrived before 6pm - didn't have my food until 635.  It was cold as usual. My drink was empty most of my meal- except when two different, I'd assume regular, customers grabbed a pitcher and topped off my sweet tea- wow. Also my bbq was hard and cold and I didn't receive any hush puppies.  Id recommend if you want bbq to make your own.  If the general customer population were Internet savvy ( most are 70+) this place wouldn't be in business. I guess in time ones expectations and taste buds degrade as well.  I won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE!! I will never doubt my Yelp community again! I came across this place during a day trip to NC while I was wanting some NC BBQ and the parking lot had about 50 cars on a Monday evening-so I tried it! Ugh! Dry, dry dry chopped pork, the red slaw (which I love everywhere else) was disgusting & maybe even rancid. Heavy damp hush puppies. Then in all my tea drinking years this has never happened before: I \"sucked\" into my straw a wad of something mushy, brown & unidentifiable! GROSS!!! I can not adequately describe the regret I have for eating here.  I will say that the wait & kitchen staff was very nice.   Avoid this place if you are looking for tasty food!"}
{"text":"Really mediocre barbecue-- bland and full of chunks of fat. Ugh. They have really gone downhill in the last few years."}
{"text":"Troutman's is the best NC BBQ I spent the first 9 years of my life here at  least once a week and the best part is that nothing has changed I love going back to troutmans, no one recognizes me anymore but the food is still excellent. Just because it isn't fancy or new does not mean it isn't good. Sometimes the old way is the old way because it is the best way."}
{"text":"Only rating it 1 star because I can't select anything less...do not waste your time or money...Restaurant is in serious need of a make over....poor service, cold food..."}
{"text":"Waited over 50 minutes for a BBQ plate and a salad. Asked for it to go. Waited some more. Did not have time to wait to see if the food is any good.  Very disappointing. Left still hungry."}
{"text":"Eh....  The food was tasteless, service was terrible.....  I honestly do not know how they have more than one Troutmans..."}
{"text":"This is an excellent out-of-the-way BBQ restaurant that I stumbled across. If I'm really going to be fussy I'd have to say that it's not the absolute best BBQ I've ever had, but it definitely ranks in the top 25%, and that's good enough to make the stop more than worthwhile."}
{"text":"This place used to be great.. Went with my dad to eat dinner 12-3-15. The sign out front said to seat yourself, so we did. Waited 10 minutes, had every waitress look at us and walk by but none would help us. We got up and walked out. Shitty service to the max. It must be a constant problem because as I was leaving an older gentleman asked me \"you couldn't get service? I was afraid of that.\" AVOID THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the largest restaurants anywhere, located inside what appears to be an old grocery store. Unfortunately that may be all that they have going for them, and it could be a bad thing, since it points out just how empty the place can be most of the time, as the seats are almost all empty.  Once seated, you can take a look at the napkin holder to decide on what you want to eat. Really. That's where they keep the menu. As you wait, you can take a look at the generally unkempt bottles of barbecue sauce and determine that you probably wouldn't want to use it to flavor your meal, as it doesn't appear that they have been cleaned anytime recently.  The old joke that there is good news and bad news comes to mind. The bad news is that you aren't going to like what is being served (changed a bit for this audience). The good news is that there is plenty of it. At least the service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Growing up in Concord, and being a self-proclaimed bbq expert, I never understood why this place is called Bar-B-Que. The meat is flavorless unless you throw some hot sauce on it to give it flavor.   The older generation seems to love Troutman for their cheap breakfast deals and cheap dinner plates but as the saying goes \"You get what you pay for.\" This place is a disgrace to North Carolina barbecue (east & west styles).   If you're a fan of cheap, greasy and flavorless food, Troutman's is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Oh my. We recently moved to the area and tried it on a whim. Should've known to turn around when I saw it was located in an old grocery store, but 2 hungry kids clouds your vision. Entering the restaurant, we were greeted with some sort of convoluted patriotic Christmas tree display. We found this a bit odd since it was August. Combine this with the local fashion choices and whatever appetite you had will disappear.  We did eventually eat, but it was one of those experiences your brain blocks out due to the trauma. It was so bad I joined Yelp just to write this. Run away, take the children! YUCK!!"}
{"text":"not a good place at all.  styrafoam cups to start out with. frozen hamburgers and the BBQ is not great and cold. french fries are bad too. the inside looks like a retirement home. strange place."}
