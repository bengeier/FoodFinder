{"text":"I never liked burritos before I tried the mango chicken burrito from Burrito Bandidos! The food here is always delicious, the music is good (and not too loud) and above all, the service is amazing! There has never been a time that I have visited this location and haven't been greeted with warm smiles and incredibly friendly service. They really go above and beyond to ensure that everyone has a pleasurable visit. Even after moving a fair distance away, I find I'm still coming back to this location. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food wouldnt recommend because I wanna eat the food all by myself, haha that first bite though. Fresh tasty and stuffed"}
{"text":"Oh Burrito Bandidos.. how do I love thee?? I crave these burrito's on a weekly basis infact! Chicken, Beef, Tofu, Bean, Halibut, Shrimp, I've had them all! And all are done absolutely brilliantly. What I think is really the success of the Bandidos is the extras. There are so many toppings and add-ons to chose from that it's actually really tough not to enjoy your rolled goodness.. you chose the taste!  If you do decide to \"get it all\" be warned.. you are in for a mess-fest. The guac, rice etc will really weigh down your burrito, and make it a little more difficult to eat. As for the hot sauce, I usually ask for it \"dotted\" as let me tell you, it is FREAKIN\" HOT!!!!   You need to go..  MMMmmhHHhhhmm!"}
{"text":"I have really mixed feelings about this Burritos Bandidos. I've have some ok experiences here but mostly terrible ones. The food is relatively decent but expensive given the unreliable quality.   Pretty much every time I've gotten a quesadilla here they have botched it. It always falls apart for lack of cheese and ends up turning into an awkward, barely edible pizza. When this first happened, the owner was extremely kind to us and even provided us with a free meal. When my three friends and I got bad quesadillas again a few weeks later, effectively wasting $40, I decided never to go back here again."}
{"text":"OKAY! Let me begin by saying that I LOVE 'rritos. TRUST ME -- I pretty much have a chipotle season's pass (yum). Not only is the food top quality, but their staff is even more scrumptious. There's a tall dark and handsome bearded man who is always very helpful and efficient when dealing with multiple customers.    In one word -- Really fun."}
{"text":"Maybe i just hit this place on an off night, but my soy burrito was super bland (it was supposed to be spicy) and super light on everything but the fake soy meat (it was supposed to be loaded).   Husband had the same experience.  I would give it a second chance, but would not go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"My favourite burrito in the city. I always get the small bean and cheese on whole wheat and it is consistently delicious. Their refried beans are creamy and have a smoky flavour to them. The hot sauce has a great kick alongside the fresh (not pickled - yuck) jalapenos. And I also love the burrito sauce - I usually ask to skip the sour cream and just double up on the sauce. The kicker is how long they flat-top grill the burrito at the end. Other places will do this for mere seconds which is good for the impatient, but it is so worth waiting for that crispy exterior which melts into a soft creamy tortilla underneath.   Yum yum.  PS: during workday lunch hours it's best to call ahead"}
{"text":"nice little place with great burittos! enjoyed the hali burittos melted in my mouth. my friends had chicken and pull pork, they loved them too. just the waiting time was a bit too long, but certainly worth it."}
{"text":"I don't even like burritos that much (i prefer tacos) but i love this place.  I've only been once but my co-workers and I have unanimously decided that this will be our Tuesday eating spot.  Sorry Bar Burrito..."}
{"text":"I think I could eat burritos five days out of each week. And in my humble opinion, the two best joints in the city to grab said deliciousness are Burrito Banditos and Big Fat Burrito- in that order.   And while some may find their rather cramped conditions a turn-off, especially during peak periods, I think it's a sign that their business is *worth* packing inside a store for.   The halibut burrito is great but far too much for a mere mortal to consume in one sitting. I'd hit up the bean and cheese burrito instead. Mmm!"}
{"text":"Not so great. The pulled pork was ok but it felt the beans have gone bad... I'm not going back ."}
{"text":"i am a native californian, so i know good mexican food. i've tried a multitude of different burrito places all across town, and this burrito was the absolute best i've had in my two years of living in toronto. i am a seriously annoyingly picky when it comes to burritos (i hold everything to a california standard) and my large shrimp burrito at this location of burrito bandidos was excellent. i will most definitely be coming back - and bringing friends! so good!!!"}
{"text":"Just as yummy as burrito boyz. I don't get why they changed their name, I guess the ownership has changed. Same as burrito boyz, lineups all the time."}
{"text":"I've been wanting some decent Mexican food since I moved to Toronto several months ago from the U.S. While I didn't expect this place to satisfy that crave, I also wasn't anticipating the rice to be rock solid when I dug into my burrito bowl. I nearly cracked my tooth on uncooked rice. I'm not an expert chef by any means, but at least I can boil rice.   However, I can attest the spicy pulled pork was tasty and flavorful. If I do come back, I will bypass the rice and beans option."}
{"text":"It was a pork kind of day.   For myself, the pork quesadilla with everything (cheese, tomatoes, green onions, green peppers, jalapeños) and for The Man, a large pulled pork burrito with everything (Mexican rice, lettuce, jalapeños, tomatoes, green onion, guacamole, cheese, green pepper) except refried beans... bean-hater.    I watched the empleado behind the counter while we were waiting for our food, and my God, do these people have technique. I'm not sure exactly how to explain this magical talent... but the guy was able to sprinkle tomatoes, peppers, cheese, across the giant tortillas *evenly*, and in one fell swoop.   Also, Bandidos somehow manages to make their whole wheat tortillas pliable and delicious. If you've ever constructed your own burritos, or whole wheat pita sandwiches at home, you understand the plight of crumbling whole wheat-goodness. ('Screw health, next time I'm finding the whitest tortilla/pita I can!')  Really the thing I don't enjoy about this place is the teensy space that you get to wait for your food in. Yes, there are some stools... but if some jackass decides to sit in the middle one, it makes things so... awkward.  Next time we will try the famous halibut... we saw one being made, and it literally looked like a big fried delicious fishstick. COOL!   Great tex-mex."}
{"text":"Been hitting this small joint for about 4 years. In that time I've had maybe 2 ill prepared burritos. Fresh toppings, chill ass staff; if I'm having a shitty day I'll grab me one of their bareetz and hit a j and all becomes well.  I'd suggest going for the steak over chicken, friends say the halibut is tight as fuck but I stick to the land mammals."}
{"text":"I've been to two of the Burrito Bandidos locations and the foods been great every time I've been.  I've recently found out they opened another location closer to where I live.  Very veryyyy happy"}
{"text":"My favourite burrito in town, spend the extra for the halibut."}
{"text":"Got a small chicken burrito bowl and small spicy pulled pork burrito. Both were delicious but the pulled was definitely the winner! The ingredients were very fresh, love that the guacamole is free and portions were very generous. But it took awhile after ordering to get our food."}
{"text":"Healthy. Fresh - free guacamole on the burrito unlike all other places- Customized to your liking- my whole family- 3 picky eaters(kids) enjoys it-  good choices - filling and delicious- highly recommend it-"}
{"text":"Fast, filling, not greasy. Great after a couple of beers day or night"}
{"text":"Although I do like the option of the pulled pork at bandidos, I can't help but be slightly deterred by the fact that the restaurant is basically in a basement. And I got a burnt quesadilla twice in a row. Nevertheless I like burritos and I'd still eat it in a pinch."}
{"text":"Found this place by pure chance meandering during the wee hours.  Great burrito The same at both locales I have been to.  Love that shrimp burrito with extra guac.  ONLY thing is its slightly pricey, good for a sporadic indulgence."}
{"text":"This place is great. And delivery is always a plus. Very fast. Chicken burrito was great and we'll worth the price. I've paid way more for less impressive burritos. But you guys need to get some side chips and nachos on the menu."}
{"text":"One of the best places to buy burrito's in the city. Their spicy pulled pork and steak and shrimp are to die for. Also the sizes are really good. I wouldn't recommend anything over the small unless you haven't eaten in days."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak burrito, the steak itself is chewy and the nastiest thing i've ever tasted. Also came across a hair in the middle of the burrito. I've eaten at their spadina location, but never coming back to this one. yuck! Wouldnt reccomend this location or the steak burrito."}
{"text":"I love the burritos here. The flavours are amazing and all the stuffings and sauce are perfect. I've been here a couple of times and it's always been a good experience. I recently had the steak burrito and it was fantastic. I also tried the chicks burrito which was good too.  Please get the hot sauce if you like your burrito hot. Their hot sauce is really spicy. I would definitely recommend this place. It was one of the better burrito places in the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"WEAR GLOVES WHEN TOUCHING FOOD GOD DAMNIT!  I went here 4 times, because the burritos are actually decent. BUT what is wrong with their staff not wearing gloves when rolling the burritos? yes, the staff preparing them with veggies etc. is wearing gloves, but not the people packaging and rolling them. Thats just disgusting! I don't know where the hands of the people have been before...."}
{"text":"One of the better burrito places I have been to downtown. Prices are on par with similar restaurants in Toronto.   The menu is on a small chalk board on the wall; a bit awkward since it is not very close to where you order but, it really is not an issue if you already know what you want. I ordered the halibut burrito and it was very good. The batter around the fish was very crispy and there was a good amount of fish inside (a lot of other places serve mostly fried batter and little fish). Guac is free and the toppings were good. I would recommend ordering the halibut in a bowl, as opposed to in a burrito, as you can better taste the fish."}
{"text":"Husband and I love this place and we have introduced all our friends from out of town or overseas too. They all love it. Great burritos, tastes pretty much like burrito boys - so we go here often since its so close to our home."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price, and open late. I particular like the chicken burrito and halibut  burrito. Good place for a late night meal"}
{"text":"The best Burritos in the city. I've only been to the Peter St. location but really good burritos!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I loved the food at Burrito Bandidos. It's to bad there are no locations in the east end. But for us it's definitely worth stopping by when we are in the Annex"}
{"text":"I totally knew Burrito Bandidos before they were called Burrito Bandidos. I don't mean that in a snobby \"I knew Sonic Youth before you did and I'm going to shout obscure b-sides as 'requests' at a show and crane my head around to see if anyone caught it\" kind of way. It's nothing really that special, Most people know them as the flagship Burrito Boyz location. But That was before the great Burrito secede of 20-ought-8, when the aforementioned \"Boyz\" had a bitter falling out and split their locations down the middle. The Richmond & Peter location went to one side, but the name and Adelaide st. Location went to the other (It remains a mystery worthy of Joe Walsh as to who currently rules over the Port Credit location).  Then there was the contest. Thousands of business card sized \"Burrito What?\" flyers went around, looking for a new name for the Richmond/Peter location (I never got around to submitting my entry for \"Burrit-O-Rama\" but I digress...), and in the interim awkwardly answered the phone simply \"Burritos!\" Eventually they landed on \"Burrito Bandidos\" and the rest, they say, is a brand new \"1st to review!\" of something thats actually been reviewed a whole bunch. ha.  Toronto has become something of a hotbed for large sized burrito joints over the past few years, with new places springing up faster than Starbucks locations, but Burrito Bandidos are by far the best in the city. They come in two sizes, Beans and Rice are spread over the bottom, with your choice of Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Green Onions, Green Pepper, jalapeños, Salsa, freshly made Guacamole, Sour Cream, their own \"Burrito Sauce\", and XXX Hot sauce (portioned in 4-5 dots). After your selections are made, the meat is added (chicken, steak, halibut, shrimp, ground round or any combination therein), the burrito is assembled and put on a flat grill to crisp the tortilla and melt the cheese. It's an admittedly simple recipe thats often imitated, but never matched.   It's important to note that as a regular customer of both, I've only noticed the subtlest of differences between the two rival burritories (did I just coin that?) since the split. Burrito Boyz (Adelaide St.) now has a choice of white or whole wheat tortilla wraps, which I don't see how it could make any taste difference, as well as appealing to their Vegan customers by advertising all non-meat products are prepared Vegan. Apart from that they're different in name only, and I couldn't really say which is better, other than traditionally, Burrito Bandidos is noticeably faster from order to first bite.  So, for once a bitter break-up hasn't affected the output of either party. Which is great, because I'd hate to see this location become the Garfunkel of Toronto Burrito joints. Instead they both prosper separately, like Outkast, and Toronto is all the better for it.  Viva La Burrito."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick hunger fix. Pass on the halibut burrito, it's over rated. Ended up being soggy by the time I got back to my hotel, which is only 5min walk away. Otherwise, the quality and amount is excellent for the price."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Would go here every day.   They have chicken, steak, shrimp, etc. excellent selection.   High recommend. Quality is really good."}
{"text":"I used to live across the street from this place and used to get burritos from them every now and then. They never disappointed me. This is one of the best burrito places I've been to in Toronto. Nice, tasty, and filling burritos!"}
{"text":"Had the small chicken... definitely worth the $$. thick, and toasted and full of chicken and fresh tasting toppings. I'll go back after the gym for sure. or anytime for that matter."}
{"text":"burritos are my favorite kind of fast food, and these guys are my favorite burritos~~~  i like the halibut, but enjoyed everything i've tried. the quesadillas are great too"}
{"text":"The burritos are OK ... the chicken needs to be seasoned or something cause its always so bland. there is too much of a garlic taste in the burrito.  what bothers me the most is they RAISED THE PRICE for a chicken burrito. its NOW 9.50!!!!!!!! wtf i can go 3 blocks up to burrito boyz and get better quality for 8.00 flat!   also this place is so small that having 5 ppl there make me feel claustrophobic  nice staff tho  doesnt make up for price hike AND meh quality"}
{"text":"I would have given this location two stars, except for the terrible customer service I received.   Had a takeout order that they completely messed up. Got the meat wrong, didn't put in the tomato or onion and put a veritable mountain of sauce even though it was requested as lightly sauced. That, was problematic in and of itself. But, given it wasn't the absolute worst burrito I've had, I could have forgiven it.  However, I sent an email to the company to let them know how disappointed I was in my order and my experience. They forwarded my email to the manager of the queen street east location who replied that the mistake was my fault. Not the fault of her \"experienced\" staff member who had to have one of the other staff members help her figure out the order because she couldn't follow what was being asked of her.   That, right there, is reason enough not to go back. In a world where customer service is a priority, the folks at Burrito Bandidos have proven that it is not their priority.   In a nutshell: mediocre AT BEST food combined with atrocious customer service. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I'll be honest... my bar for \"good burrito\" has always been pretty low because I love'em. I just love'em and it doesn't take much to impress me.  It basically just has to be warmer than room temperature and have some spice and I am happy.   Well, that was until Burrito Bandidos. These guys raised my \"burrito bar\" and it's going to be a hard go at it for all the future burritos I have yet to enjoy. Bandidos is a tough act to follow.   Saucy, spicy, cheesy - check. The ratio of rice to bean - perfect. The ratio of tortilla to filling - excellent. The small size was more than enough. Tortilla chips were good too, but unnecessary.   Great price. Great product. Highly recommended - especially if you thought some of the other burrito chains were tops... You have to try Bandidos. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So lucky to work close to this little haven of joy. Love the underground appeal and also great option of calling in ahead of time in case you're rushing. Fast and friendly service. My only complaint is that they don't have one near my house...but then again that's not really a complaint. Large chicken with everything but beans? Yes please!"}
{"text":"So I'm writing this review with with burrito goop all down my clothes (and actually inside my top AND bra, if i'm honest). I am a messy, messy eater. Burrito Bandidos is not messy-eater friendly. Learn from my mistakes and DO NOT UNWRAP IT FROM THE FOIL. It doesn't matter if you are at home and have taken care to ensure you're wearing sweats and a vest. It also doesn't matter how water-tight the wrap job looks. The spooging will come from the top of the burrito and it will come with a vengeance.  Still, that doesn't change the fact that the food here is amazing. I ordered a large chicken burrito with everything but jalapenos (my taste buds have been successfully dulled by an Irish upbringing of potatoes and bread so I can't handle spicy like you culturally refined Canadians). My boyfriend got a large steak, which I maintain smelled like dog food. Be that as it may, he said it was \"appropriately chunky and tasty\" and has no problem giving this place a five.  I was impressed by the fact that the girl working here was a total burrito architect. She was flinging toppings around (making two burritos at once!) willy-nilly and everything was just landing in neat little lines. She was a pro.   Pricewise we paid $16.50 for two larges, which felt like bloody bricks when the server handed them over. Minus one star because it wasn't QUITE hot enough, in my opinion. Did not stop me, but yeah, would have been nice. Next time I'll pop it in the oven before strapping on the feed bag."}
{"text":"The chicken burrito is excellent and the place is cheaper than the burrito places I usually go to. You are probably good with a \"small\" size, as the wrap and fillings are all the same, the difference is only in the meat (good to know - as when I got the large there was actually too much meat compared to other ingredients for my liking)."}
{"text":"The location on queen st e is amazing! There customer service is great, they know how to make the burritos really warm without burning the burrito and all the times ive gone there ingredients were fresh, both vegetables and meat. Definitely better then burrito boyz."}
{"text":"I use to enjoy my burritos here, although I distinctly remember not really enjoying my last meal here a few months ago, I gave it another try since I was feeling burritos tonight.  Boy was I disappointed, I think it may be my last visit to Burrito Bandidos, I have no reason to come back since the quality has gone down while the prices has gone up, $25 for 2 burritos is on the higher end.  I got the halibut burrito and shrimp/steak burrito, the tortilla was soft but a little chewy which is done to my liking, but the halibut was fishy tasting which was off putting.  It was my first time trying the steak burrito and it was bad, the beef tasted like it was very bad grade, it was chewy and dry, in addition I found a hair in my shrimp.    This was a food option a year ago when the food quality was much better, it's a shame that the quality has been declining since."}
{"text":"Best burrito in town hands down. Friendly service too! Love the pulled pork burrito."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Consistently good food. I especially like the mango chicken. They grill the finished burritos to brown the tortillas, which adds to the flavor. The burrito bowls are a good choice too if you want to forgo the tortilla. Burritos can get a little messy, but it's well worth it. If you want a real treat, try the halibut. It's pricey, but good!"}
{"text":"Hoorah for burrito banditos!!   So glad this place opened, when you need fresh, healthy(ish), tasty takeaway this is the place! I love their halibut burrito, extra spicy, extra guac, light on the rice (otherwise the burrito is gargantuan !!). Only suggestion would be to have corn tortillas available - other than that they have got it down pat. There are some seriously rubbish burrito joints in the city, this thankfully is one of the good ones."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you love burritos. This place is like heaven. It's a very small little store in the basement of the building and may not look so great at first sight but their burritos are out of this world. I could have them everyday and still not be tired. When I go without having their burritos for a long stretch of time, I have some major withdrawal symptoms. lol. Their burritos are BIG and packed with your choice of good and fresh ingredients. Prices are cheap for the quantity and quality of what you get. Love, love, love this place."}
{"text":"Really nice place for Mexican food. Not only the burrito but also the quasadeiia is really delicious. We always order a chicken burrito and beef quasadeiia."}
{"text":"My usual go-to for dinner before a movie at the Scotiabank theatre.  The quality is always pretty consistent, the prices are reasonable, and although there may be a bit of a wait, especially during peak hours, it's worth it.    I find that after \"the split\" Bandidos and Boys still offered a pretty similar experience, and there wasn't really a loser out of the two (at least as far as I was concerned as a customer).  This location is tiny, even by burrito-hut standards, but they are efficient enough to still crank them out in good order.  There have been variations to the menu over the years, but nothing drastic, and the general experience has remained the same.  If I had to classify them, I'd say they were in the \"grilled with re-fried bean\" camp, because that's how I recognize the overall taste.  Good fresh ingredients, and they provide the standard veggie, chicken and beef, as well as the now-classic halibut and a shrimp offering for those who want to branch out a bit.  Good food, reasonable prices, and a firm place in my permanent burrito rotation."}
{"text":"Wow. The spicy pulled pork is one of the best burrito and quesadilla combinations I have ever had. I've been back multiple times since my first visit and haven't been disappointed.   I always end up eating the burrito there so the sauce doesn't go through the burrito by the time I walk home. You can take the quesadilla home with no issues.   This is by far the best burrito in Toronto - hands down - accept no substitutes. Don't be fooled by the fact this place is in a basement. Makes it even better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch after finally discovering this place. It's easy to miss - I had walked by a few times recently without noticing it. It's a basement location and the sign is down near ground level and it's overshadowed by signs for the restaurant on the floor above.  Burrito Bandidos is one of the top burrito joints in the city. I ordered a small mango chicken and it was filling - very tasty. Because it was my first visit, I got everything on it. The hot sauce was a bit overpowering and took away some of the flavour (couldn't really detect the mango), so next time I will probably hold off on it. Other than that, nothing to gripe about.  Including a Coke and taxes, my bill came up to a little over $9. It's a busy lunch spot, but I only had to wait about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this by saying I ate their burrito in the early evening, 100% sober.  I had the chicken burrito, which was huge and nicely grilled, but overall pretty disappointing.  It leaked all over the place because it wasn't properly wrapped, and there were lots of gristle-y chewy pieces in the chicken that turned me off.  Plus it just sort of tasted like mush without much flavour.  I was really excited to try this place after all the great reviews, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love the burrito bowls! Great portions, you'll definitely be full from their small. Very fresh toppings although the meat is kind of weird. You can't really tell the difference between the beef, chicken or pork... they're all to grounded. I would Recommend the Halibut.. yum!   Great place for lunch and on the run!"}
{"text":"This hobbit hole of a place is easy to miss, but yes it's worth going under the stars. The quesadillas are over the moon. They are delicious and filling. They are definitely worth your time!"}
{"text":"Great burrito.  Only one thing, when I tell them spicy, they make it really spicy, so now I have to tell them just a bit...  I actually wish that they had 3 different spicy ranges, (none, normal, spicy)  Very good staff. I was very comfortable when I ordered my burrito. I asked them questions and they were very kind and nice.  Usually eat once a week tho, cant have it everyday."}
{"text":"First time having a bandido burrito...definately worth every penny... next time trying the spicy pulled pork"}
{"text":"I couldn't rave about this joint more! The food is fresh, service is fresh and they carry plenty of topping options. I am a fan if the bean and cheese and my hubby loves the chicken. 5 stools in store and a picnic table outside."}
{"text":"This was my first Canadian burrito.  Have lived across the U.S., now for my money there is no better burrito than a carnitas super burrito from the mission. Not trying to snob out, that's just my preference. There are many many delicious burritos to be eaten.  Ordered pulled pork with everything. Got the medium salsa ... that was a mistake, it was uninteresting. It was like the kind of generic tomato \"mild salsa\" you get in a jar at a supermarket (i.e. cooked, not fresh like pico, and not spicy). You also get a choice of tortilla. They throw the entire assembled burrito on the grill.  The pork was overly sweet for my taste, but then again it was advertised as pulled pork and most people like sweet BBQ, so who am I to disagree. It was fine. All the other ingredients were fresh and improved the total package, overall a solid burrito.  Would eat again, staff were friendly and fast. I would change up the salsa and order something else next time ... and they have some interesting options, Halibut, mango chicken.  Would recommend they throw some serious cilantro, onion in there and kick the salsa up a notch. Bring the flava! I hope there is a place in Toronto where you can get a big wad of cilantro for 25 cents, because that is how life is improved for everyone."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best burritos around in Toronto.  Big Fat in Kensington gives it a run for its money (I mean Ryan Gosling was there) but I don't think I found a better burrito than here.  The choice of size is helpful (even the smaller one would be filling when drunk) although regardless the thing is spectacular.  Almost competes with Boojum in Belfast to be the best in the world..."}
{"text":"I live near both a Burrito Bandidos, and a Big Fat Burrito (Annex).  I will walk further, every time, to have Burrito Bandidos.  Even in the rain.  Yes, the space is small, and there is a solid ten minute wait as they make your burrito in front of you, and cook it thoroughly.  I say it's well worth the sacrifice.  They've never messed up one of my orders (and I've placed some peculiar orders), and not only that, but I've ordered 100 burritos for work, a few hours in advance, and they've had them ready, hot and fresh.  It's a happy day on a film set when there's Burrito Bandidos for second meal.  Personal favorite is the small chicken (it's biiiig enough), but the pulled pork and halibut are also raved about.   I've had more flavourful burritos (Rancho Relaxo on College by Spadina), but these are excellent, too."}
{"text":"This establishment is very close to my work and I often stop by to pick up a burrito for lunch. I strongly recommend placing your order by phone because come lunchtime this place gets quite crowded.  Being a chain restaurant, there are certain standardizations which I understand cannot be avoided. Still it is possible to customize your burrito to a great extent. I usually skip the rice and onions, substituting with few more vegetables instead. Their default level of spiciness is low so make sure you ask for spicy. The textured vegetable protein burrito is my favourite.  I like this location, certainly one of the better burrito places in town. The owner is very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Chipotle prices, sub-Chipotle quality. If burritos were bricks, I could probably build a house based on the number I've eaten in my life.   My experience was so disappointing to the point that I decided to make this my first Yelp review. The first thing you notice (it's hard not to) is that it's unnecessarily loud in there. I'm all for music to create an atmosphere, but there were tunes (with lyrics others might find offensive, although I don't care about that) being played at an absurd volume... to the point where I could barely get my order across.   They do their sauces well. The hot sauce had some nice kick to it, and the burrito sauce complemented it well. Unfortunately, this is where my praise ends.  The guac was nothing short of disgusting. Waaaay too much citrus and I'm pretty sure the avocados were cut open 24 hrs prior. I got the steak/chicken mix- some of the driest meat I've ever had, on both fronts.  I decided on a bowl today, expecting it to be huge- the way it is at Burrito Boyz. Nope. Far less food... for a higher price, as well. Decidedly inferior quality, too.  I thought I'd check them out given the positive reviews. Must have caught them on a bad day. I wish I had better things to say, but I won't be back since Burrito Boyz and Chipotle are close enough to me and both much better. Best of luck to these folks though."}
{"text":"I get their food all the time. When friends from England came to Toronto for two days, this was pretty much #2 thing to do in Toronto besides go up the CN tower. The value for money, nutrition and taste are excellent. A lot of times now I order on the phone in advance and come pickup with no wait time. It's a good trick, I recommend it."}
{"text":"I needed a quick post-work-pre-lecture-meal. Although I had already put a certain green pizza chain in my mind, I left Spadina station at the \"wrong\" exit, was briefly disoriented, panicked, and went to the restaurant which I had in my HEART. Didn't regret it.  Restaurant size: One does not simply come to Burrito Bandidos with the intent of sitting and eating.   Portion size: Not feeling particularly gluttonous that late afternoon/early evening, I opted for a regular steak and chicken. Still a good size, but I didn't realize how hungry I actually was until I was happily munching on it outside of OISE.   Food quality: Did I mention I didn't realize how hungry I was? Maybe it was the hunger, maybe it was the deprivation from burritos, but it was pretty good. Granted, I don't think I've had a burrito blow my mind before...but it was ultra satisfying. My instructor may have walked past me with judgement, but I'm the one with the burrito...  Service: It took around 10 minutes from order placement to \"Steak and chicken!\" which is...kind of normal. Go read some printed Onion articles and have a laugh while you wait.  Final thoughts: I'll grab a large burrito next time. Sorry (not sorry) to the rest of the class..."}
{"text":"I've heard about his place for a long time but had never tried it until today and sadly I won't be back anytime soon.  Had the standard chicken burrito and it was disgusting.  Everything tasted greasy and burnt.  Yuck  Go to Burrito Boys, Chiptole or even those places in foodcourts before going here."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of burritos but their burritos are amazing. I tried steak and Halibut. Both are great. Staffs are very friendly too."}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  I've been wanting to try it for a while but haven't gotten a chance till today.  I got the large bean and cheese burrito with everything (they have a good selection of proteins: chicken,  pork,  steak,  fish).  The burrito itself was great and pretty filling.  They have the option of whole wheat or white flour tortillas.  I got the whole wheat which was very good and grilled very nicely.  The contents of the burrito were delicious and tasted and looked fresh.  I asked for everything,  so my only complaint is that I either didn't get cilantro and jalapeños or they ran out,  to be fair I wasn't looking when they put it together so I couldn't tell them I especially wanted it after I put in my order.  The burrito sauce wasn't too hot but had a nice punch to it,  if I noticed the sauce options I would have went for hot.   I'm pretty excited to try their quesadilla next.   Update: I got the soya mix quesadilla,  not great.  I wouldn't recommend. Stick to the burritos."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\".   Definitely.   The burrito was okay, nothing spectacular. I much rather would have Mr. Sub across the street.   If you are looking for a burrito place, have time to travel - Big Fat Burrito in Kensington Market is the place to go. If you are in the area of College Park, I don't know any other burrito place in the area, so I guess... hit his place up.   The staff was rude, BTW. Approximately $8-$10 a meal. Got a large chicken, $9.50."}
{"text":"Awesome burritos! I had a chicken burrito with everything on it plus burrito sauce & sour cream and my friend had the steak burrito. They were sooo good!! The refried beans and rice were really nice - I'm not sure why one reviewer found the burritos \"too mushy\" - they're burritos with refried beans. Regardless I say bring on the mush!   They even toasted the shells! The hot sauce was really hot - just how I like it - but I am glad I had it on the side instead of inside the burrito. I'd say it was a hotness level of 4 out of 5. I usually like 3.5 - 4.5.   Just one thing on the negative side - my friend ordered his burrito with everything except 2 items and it seemed they got our orders confused because mine didn't have these 2 items and his did. Anyway we just swapped fillings.   Friendly staff, limited bar-stool seating. AWESOME BURRITOS. I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"So, I should preface this with a personal disclaimer: I grew up in Southern California and my standards for Mexican food are quite high.  That being said, Burrito Bandidos is a slow and unsanitary place.  Do not go here if you are in a hurry at lunch or need something quick on the go.  It took about 10+ minutes for me to get a veggie burrito, which isn't so bad in the big scheme of things, but is much slower than places like Chipotle or just about any other Mexican take-out.  But, this isn't why I'm giving them 1 star.  I'm giving them 1 star because of their strange and unhygienic practices.  When you order, staff place an old and stained wooden thing (think of a popsicle stick) onto your tortilla.  This wooden thing has a V for veggie, and other letters designating other kinds of burritos.  I don't know why, but I found this to be a little weird.  The real problem, though, was in how the cook managed my burrito.  He wasn't wearing gloves and was turning the burrito over with his hands, which he'd been on a heavily stained black apron.  He was also taking sips from an old Tim Horton's coffee cup while preparing my burrito.  I'm usually not a stickler on these things, but I don't like it when someone whose hands look dirty are touching food that I'm about to eat.    Also, the burrito was't that good."}
{"text":"Burrito Bandidos has some of the best burritos I've had in the downtown. Being in the Annex, it's a pretty convenient location. The pricing is pretty standard, and the burritos are delicious. It can easily hold its own against some of the bigger chains like Chipotle.   Only downside is that there's barely anywhere to sit down, other than a tight set of chairs near a high table facing the only window. You will most likely be taking the food to go."}
{"text":"This place has the best burritos in Toronto! The best.  I love Mexican cuisine and Burrito Bandidos is like heaven to me. I used to go to the place on Peter Street which is now closed but this location is just as good. Highly recommend Burrito Bandidos."}
{"text":"Went to Burrito Bandidos on a Sunday night for a quick and wholesome eat. I had actually been talking to someone in London about places to eat in Toronto and without even specifying the area I was staying in, or what type of food I had been trying, she mentioned Burrito Bandidos and how reasonable it was.  I went with a co-worker and we both ordered large Burritos. I got a large Chicken burrito with everything on it.  The first thing I noticed was when I was handed the food over the counter, this thing has to be a pound. It is a serious amount of heft. Score!   We sat on the curb outside to eat it because all the small sitting area was full. Delicious burrito. Pretty much lived up to expectations.   For about $10 (no drink) I would recommend you try this place. You have to be hungry to order the large... I would like to go back sometime!"}
{"text":"Burritos seem to be the next food on the rise and thank god for that cuz I love em. This place is awesome, went here to grab dinner for me, my boyfriend and 2 friends one night. I ordered the steak, you get to choose whatever toppings you like and I'm pretty simple so I just got cheese, jalapeños, hot sauce, burrito sauce and lettuce. The burrito was like the size of my head and for 2 plus 2 drinks came to $17. Not bad seeing as I could have eaten it for a week. The steak was flavourful and delicious but I warn you, the hot sauce plus the jalapeños was a taddd too spicy for me, so unless you like the eye watering, nose streaming kind of hot I wouldn't recommend the combo.  The only thing I wish they had was avocado but I guess beggars can't be choosers. You can bet your bottom dollar ill be back for another burrito real soon."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. It is my go to burrito any day. Portions are big, service is fast. My favourite."}
{"text":"Ordered a Halibut Burrito with the standard fixings. Called in advanced (convenient :) ) and it was ready to be picked up in 10 minutes.   Perfect like last time - burrito is consistent, fresh, and just amazing!"}
{"text":"Fell in love at the Spadina location, but this location is definitely more convenient for a TTC pick me up on the way home to finch! =D  I'm a sucker for the Bean and Cheese burrito though I recently cut out the cheese (I know this is a major loss for most) as I went vegan. The difference between the cheese and no cheese version is best experienced by the midway point of the burrito where it would usually start getting sloppy. This doesn't happen in the dairy free version, so a slight upside?   Compared to Big Fat, I find that the quality of the sauces is much more satisfying at bandidios along with the price point (Double Points!!) I've heard that the meat filled burritos are quite good as well though I have yet to meet anyone who has tried the halibut or the pulled pork so I'll update when I find someone to try it.  One thing is that it would be very difficult for Bandidos to handle a large group as I noticed that like the Spadina location there is a fairly long order completion time. Not a major loss as its well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food and staff earn this business top marks for quality.  Haven't gone into the meat area of their offerings but I am a huge fan of their bean and cheese perfect for vegetarians.  Price wise it's hard to beat when you compare it to more expensive \"gourmet\" burrito joints that have been sweeping Toronto lately. Under 6 for a basic burrito packed perfectly with all the fixins!   If you are a fan of spicy kick, their peppers are a must and compliment their salsa and guac mix.   The line ups can get long and I have waited for 15 mins to get my hands on their product, this is not a fault, yet a drawback of success. Although expansion would solve this problem the idea of making their burritos into something resembling mcdonalds is hugely negative and I am content to wait for my food. I like to think of it as giving me time to work up my appetite and really savor the food.  Definite 5!"}
{"text":"I've gone here countless times, but the quality of the beef/chicken mix over the last 2-3 times has dropped off substantially.  I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Adequate burritos.  Slow, even with light traffic.  (What can they possibly be doing to a burrito for 15 minutes in the back?)"}
{"text":"The halibut burrito is a personal favourite. Since it takes awhile to cook, we'll usually order it ahead of time, then swing by to pick it up or to eat it right away. It's heavy enough for splitting between the two of us.  Clientele: Hungry male customers whose girlfriends are away for the weekend."}
{"text":"I go here regularly for the fantastic Chicken Burrito they custom make. Go here if you want a quality Burrito. Good looking staff and they have a scorpion sauce that is hotter than ghost sauce. #%@&!!! Awesome :)"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Horror Story**  I've gone here a few times, as one of the many burrito options nearby my place of work (workplace). They offer a passable bean burrito, and a soy meat option.  The most recent time I was in there was Christmas day. I went in with a co-worker - he ordered a chicken/shrimp burrito, and I ordered a bean. We were each given our own order number. I grabbed the burrito they handed me when they called my number, and my workmate did the same. We walked back to our office, and I took a bite of what I was told was my burrito. In so doing, I bit into a hunk of chicken, and spat it out. I had been handed the wrong burrito. At no point from being handed the burritos by the cashier did they leave our respective hands - the chicken burrito was the one I was handed, and the one I was told was vegetarian. This is 100% on them.  I am a strict vegetarian, and this is incredibly disturbing to me - enough to warrant a one-star review. This is pretty careless a mistake to make, and one I simply won't risk being made again; definitely enough to make me never want to go back. A non-vegetarian or person without any dietary concerns may not see such a big deal, so just imagine being served dog and being told it's chicken.  I sent an email to the only address provided on the website, and have not heard back. Very displeased indeed."}
{"text":"As much as I want to love this place there's definitely some problems.  First and scariest is the handling of food. I've seen cashiers handle money before food without even so much as a glance of a wash. Add in pure apathy towards customers?   The pork was amazing and the burrito fulfilled its class expectation, but we must progress."}
{"text":"Good burrito, friendly staff but a tad slow when there was only 3 of us in the place.  I get that they grill each one and it takes some time but things seemed a bit chaotic behind the counter.    None of this takes away from the burrito itself which really was quite good and I'll certainly go back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic burritos. Solid food and extremely filling. No shortcuts, no BS, just straight up sizeable burritos."}
{"text":"It's a nice little Burrito place on Queen ST. E near the beaches. Ingredients are fresh. The place is clean and well maintained and the stuff are friendly. The prices are a little higher than in other Burrito paces we visited in Toronto, but they don't charge extra for guacamole and the quality of food is very good. You can park at the nearby LCBO (same side, few buildings east) or at the parking lot across the street, behind the movie theater. I ordered small shrimp & Chicken burrito ($7.96), and it was very well done. My husband had a large halibut burrito ($10.90) . I would recommend this place if you like Mexican."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing staff.  Steak and chicken mix is my go to but mango chicken and the halibut are also great choices.  I like some heat so I get them all extra spicy.  Best thing about this place is the consistency of their food so I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Very small and always packed place, the burrito is good but nothing special..."}
{"text":"I ordered a small steak burrito on white and it was absolutely delicious!! Huge burrito. I cut it in two and both meals were very filling. One of my favourite places to eat in Toronto.   However I only gave three stars because, while it may not be mandatory, the man who rolled and grilled my burrito did not wear gloves."}
{"text":"Far from authentic but still big on 'tude, Burrito Bandidos have been serving up saucy clubland snacks for over six years (though in its early days it was Burrito Boyz).  A great lunch alternative if you work nearby, or a satisfying latenight treat on your way home from bar hopping."}
{"text":"I usually go to another location of burrito banditos, but this location is better (the other one was on bloor near spadina and it is much smaller)! The people who work there are fast, friendly, and efficient. It's quite spacious in there with a few tables to sit at for some quick eats.  I really like their food. I always ordered their burritos, and they are huge! Even the small is enough to fill you up. I ordered a quesadilla tonight and it was great. You still get all the toppings but with no rice and a ton of cheese. I like that all the toppings are free, and they are very fresh too! They also don't skimp on the meat! 5/5!"}
{"text":"So good..... and so hearty. The place is small but you really order to take out. The food is always delicious and the ghost pepper sauce is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Bloor West, between St. George to Bathurst is largely missing lunch spots that are fast, affordable, and filling. Burrito Bandidos is one of those few, precious, locations where you can get truly delicious food at very reasonable prices.   Over the past year a group of us from work have eaten just about everything on the menu here. The most commonly purchased items are the bean and cheese burrito (sometimes with soy), halibut burrito, and chicken quesadilla. They're all wonderful options from a generally good menu.   All burritos come in two sizes: large and small. For 99.9% of people the small is plenty large. The large is almost certainly bigger than your stomach and, even if you do eat it all, you're probably going to feel too full for the rest of the day/evening. When in doubt, choose small.   There are, however, a few words of advice/warning that you should know:  1. This place can get busy during the lunch rush. But you can place your order ahead of time either online or by phone. Do so and you can save yourself a bunch of time; 2. The burritos can be spicy. They add both jalapeños and a nice habanero sauce. If you don't do hot, just ask for them to not include these particular items; 3. The vegan burritos tend to be more saucy than the non-vegan ones. So, if you eat vegan, still get food from here but be sure to get some extra napkins.   Finally, I would warn you away from just one menu item: the pulled pork. Sadly the pulled pork at Burrito Bandidos is stringy and not nearly moist enough. Do yourself (and your teeth!) a favour and get just about anything else on the menu. Or at least get some toothpicks at the nearby Shoppers or Metro; you'll need them to get the meat out of your teeth post-burrito."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and decided to give this place a try.  I usually make the trip to Burrito Boyz and heard that this place was opened by one of the previous owners.  I ordered a regular pulled pork with everything on it.  The flavors were good, the meat was soft and tender. The only problem was the burrito was very soft and mushy which made it very hard to eat.  I will give them a second try just maybe asking them to keep it on the grill a bit longer"}
{"text":"Worth the money. Come and give it a shot, you won't regret! Bandidos guacamole is the best in town."}
{"text":"Oh my god. Their \"small\" burrito bowls are humungous and I couldn't finish it... so good. I am in love with their online ordering feature and their shrimp and chicken burritos. I want to devour this whole place every day. I love that they put up Onion articles on their walls... makes for some really hilarious and entertaining reading while you're eating."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, and the line was incredibly long. I had to give them a try as a result of a near perfect Yelp rating, so I stood in line patiently.   When it was my turn to order, the lady behind the counter was impatient and probably stressed out due to the lunch rush. She started piling ingredients onto my burrito WHILE asking me what I want on it. I ordered the spicy pulled pork burrito (Small for $7.90) and asked for no peppers or jalapenos, and guess what, she still put in those items.   I couldn't properly enjoy my burrito - my eyes were watering, and my nose was running non-stop. The pulled pork wasn't marinated long enough, and parts of it was dry. I see that they put the burritos on the grill for awhile before handing it to customers, so I don't understand why my burrito was wet and soggy - the skin was nice and crispy in certain areas, but not consistent at all.   I'd go back to Burrito Boys for more consistent quality and service, but I'll give their halibut burrito a shot the next time I come here."}
{"text":"Likely the best Burrito to go place of the bunch in this city where people roll over and accept low standards as the norm. Here there's a hot toasted burrito, well-proportioned ingredients and they seem to create the ingredients and assemble it all like they care. Note to business - do like this and you will have repeat customers."}
{"text":"The people working here are not the friendliest. The mood among the staff is solemn, and the girl behind the counter behaved like she was mildly annoyed with me. However, no one was obviously rude, and I'm willing to put up with a little attitude for a good burrito.   I had a small chicken burrito with everything on it except cheese and jalapeños. The chicken was flavourful, if a little dry, and the texture of the burrito was nice (read: not dripping wet). All in all it was a pretty good burrito. Not eye-poppingly delicious, but I'd probably come back for a quick lunch in a pinch."}
{"text":"I went again a couple of weeks ago and it wasn't as good.  First they were very stingy on the meat and second they forgot to salt the meat I think.Tsk tsk.  Very bland.  The staff were different."}
{"text":"I go here for my Halibut / Shrimp Large Burritos.   The original!  Pro-Tip.  Order over the phone and walk over pay and pick up.  That's the best way to do it.  If you order Halibut give it 15 mins."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burrito in Toronto, that keeps me coming back! My go to food during exams, when I have a craving for something filling and flavourful.  I have tried the chicken, steak, and shrimp burrito bowls and all are fantastic. The meat is always extremely flavourful and abundant- they definitely do not skimp on the meat. The guacamole, tomatoes, green onions, peppers and cilantro always taste fresh. The burrito sauce and hot sauce are actually spicey in comparison to places like Chipolte.   The portions are extremely generous for the price point (a small burrito bowl will leave you quite full). The service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Best.  Vegan.  Burrito.  Ever.  I have dreams about this burrito......the delicious ground soy, the guacamole, the refried beans, the jalapenos - wheeeee!!!!  You can also get it with cheese and sour cream, but honestly, they couldn't possibly make it any better, so ask them to make it vegan!  They grill it, which adds a whole new flavour dimension to the tortilla.  I always call on my way (it takes up to ten minutes, depending on how busy they are), and it's ready for me when I arrive.  The only time I had to wait was on Pantless Sunday, when it was filled with U of T students in their underpants....apparently that earned them a discount?  The students stopped harassing me to take mine off when I told them I was going commando.  Anyway - go try the veggie burrito!"}
{"text":"Yikes, despite the good reviews and my softspot for any half decent Mexican joint, this was pretty bad.  They seem to have enough decent veg toppings to make a decent burrito, but the watery overcooked rice and the gristly bland unseasoned and garlicy chicken ruined the day. The end result was a sloppy mess with very little flavour and hard inedible chicken cartilage bits (3) in my large burrito that were just awful.  Please get a proper rice cooker and a handful of chili powder, don't rush the grilling, HOLD the garlic and you'd have passable burrito @ $8.  This mess at over $10 is just plain wrong."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious burritos at a good price! They're tasty,  filling, and everything a burrito should be.  New favourite place.   Warning,  the hot sauce is really hot and sometimes a little uneven in the burrito, but I like hot and the staff were really nice and offered me free sour cream when I bit  into a really spicy part!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians, do you like meat analogues?  Rather than just filling their vegetarian option with more beans (hear that, Chino Locos?), they actually use a well seasoned soy \"ground beef\". (My guess - Yves.  Don't like fake meat?  There IS a bean option.)  Nice to have the choice of size (I had a small...plenty big enough) and whole wheat or white (had whole wheat...felt healthy!).  Nice blend of typical ingredients, and staff was friendly.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"I had gone to this place after reading in a BlogTO article that it was a good spot for burritos but what a joke.   I was so so so turned off after I watched the staff refill their salsa at the counter with a jug of salsa I've seen at Costco :) I was half way into my chicken burrito at this point, which was pretty large so portions aren't a problem here, but I lost my appetite. So gross watching things look like they're right off the delivery truck.  Unauthentic and won't be back. So many great places for authentic Mexican and Latin American food in this city, don't spend your money here if that's the experience you're after."}
{"text":"I am a huge, HUGE burrito lover. So it goes without saying that I might be a tad bias when reviewing any burrito shop....I wear my heart on my sleeve.  That said, I love Burrito Bandidos. I am a vegetarian, so I really appreciate that they offer a veggie soy meat option. I usually get all the toppings, all sauces, and spicy.   They're open late for a post-bar, pre-bedtime bite. For the 9-5'ers, you can call ahead on your lunch hour for easy pick-up. However, if you work near by it might be faster to just walk in and order.   The staff is friendly, the burritos are smokin' and if you're a vegetarian - you're winning."}
{"text":"Good burrito but ordered off uber eats and it came quick but my rice was not cooked so I was eating hard chunks of rice which is very unpleasant! Would try ordering again because maybe it was just because the worker didn't  know how to cook rice properly but if it happens again I will never order again!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by Burrito Banditos on my way home from my day of discovering Kensington and Chinatown.  For the longest time, I've passed by BB but the Bloor sushi joints always got the better of me. I had the small shrimp and steak burrito on whole wheat with all the fixin's and hot sauce (except jalopeno).  The torilla was a bit burnt but the rest of the flavour was A-Ok. Even with the small, it was still huge and filling. Ordering was fast and with smiles, had to wait 10 minutes for my order as it was made to order, which is okay.  The space is small, a few bar stools inside and a picnic table outside, so most orders (including mine) were for take away.  It's a good option if you're on thr Bloor strip and don't feel like eating sushi."}
{"text":"For the record: This is the original location of the restaurant formerly- known-as- Burrito Boyz.  The original two owners who created the deliciousness of a Toronto-style grilled burrito have split up. One kept the original name, one the original location. So, now we have Burrito Boyz on Adelaide (boo!) and Burrito Bandidos underground off Peter Street in club land (yeah!) This place is still the best, despite all the imitations around town. I hope  nothing but the name changes- fresh ingredients, fun staff, massive burritos stuffed with said fresh ingredients.  Keep it real."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once, so this is an initial impression.  I ordered the Halibut burrito, fully loaded. This thing was massive, but it was just what I needed as I was starving. I know the burrito was made fresh because 1) I can see it, and 2) It took some time to cook the fish. The ingredients are all very fresh and tasty, wholesome, and filled me up! The place is small, there's only a couple of handfuls of seats, so it's very much a fast-food type setting. The prices will initially appear to be quite high, but when you consider how big the burritos are then you will find the prices to be fair. The staff are friendly and the place is clean enough.   The one complaint I have is that they should ask you if you're eating here to taking it to-go. Because all burritos were first wrapped in a wrapper and then slipped into a paper bag, even though I was dining-in. It's a waste of a paper bag."}
{"text":"I'm so used to \"taco bell\" style taco and burrito places. This place blew me away. a nice local joint with a great selection.   I had the pulled pork burrito with all the fixins. Spicy! ( Something else you don't see a lot of in big chain \"tex mex\" )   A must-stop from now on when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"When Toronto was going through the burrito craze a few years back, I made an effort to try quite a few places. Burrito Bandidos was one of the last places I tried since I didn't live/work near any locations, but once I did, I haven't looked back. Taste-wise they are pretty similar to Burrito Boyz (definitely not a bad thing, as they are close second for me) since the owners of the two chains have history together. But while most places offer the standard chicken/pork/veg choices, what sets Bandidos apart is that their menu has many more options. In particular, being able to combine different fillings together can yield delicious new flavours. My favourite though has to be the chicken mango - a flavour option I have yet to see anywhere else. Absolutely fantastic. Plus they have more options for hot sauce, including ghost pepper hot sauce should you be into not enjoying your meal, and having your anus bleed for several days afterwards. Not much space to sit and eat inside if the weather is crappy, but usually the few seats clear out pretty quickly since everyone is voraciously scarfing down one of the best burritos they've ever had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ordered online through their website for pickup and it was to be ready 15 minutes later. When I arrived, they delivered a large, delicious, spicy, 5 lb, pulled pork burrito baby with all the toppings. I managed to eat half and decided to save the other half for later. My friend got the halibut burrito and said it was really good so I will definitely give it a try the next time I go."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favourite burrito places. I'm a big fan of spice and these burritos deliver. Very reasonably priced, lots of filling options. Service is so-so, but usually quick. I've dragged a lot of friends and family here and they've all agreed that it's delicious."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago I was downtown with my former babysitter (back in the day) to watch avatar at scotiabank theatre. We passed by here and she's like this is the best burrito you will ever eat!! I'm like sweet. It was alright but burrito boyz is where it's at."}
{"text":"I had a large chicken burrito. The portion is generous, and I'm a big eater. There was too much sauce on it and the chicken was weird, it seems like ground up dark meat and indistinguishable from other meats.  Then again I'm all about knowing what I'm eating.... just not into processed/low quality crap. I prefer Fat Bastard because it seems more natural and you can tell it's good quality chicken breast."}
{"text":"I have to totally disagree with the single other review posted to this point.  I heard about Burrito Banditos about three weeks ago, and have been about 5 times so far.    First, I love this kind of food, these big burritos assembled to order and pressed on a flat top.  I know its common in many places, but in the GTA its a newish food genre.  Anyhow, I find these things like super comfort food - crispy on the outside, soft and warm and gooey on the inside, and all that with a mix of savoury flavours.    I don't eat meat, so I am really happy that they have a veggie burrito with the \"fake meat' (soy protein) option.  Though I don't eat meat, I do miss the texture of ground meat in something like a burrito or a chili.  I use the same kind of textured soy protein at home in my own cooking.    Aaaanyhow, I got off point.  I like the place, I like the energy, the friendly staff, and the delicious burritos.  If there was one thing I'd change, I wish they had some sort of a side order, the way you always get fries or rings with a burger.   I'm not sure what goes with burritos, but one more thing in the mix would kick it up one more notch for me.  Oh, and a beer.  A beer would be good.  To me, it's a great value.  My kids love it, I love it, my buddy loves it.  super yum."}
{"text":"Hey guys,  I've been meaning to review this place for ages as it's my go-to place for a great burrito!  All of the veggies are super fresh, the meats and shrimp are great and everything is just incredibly tasty.  My latest addiction is the Steak & Shrimp burrito, a great combination of surf and turf.  The portions are great, small is filling, large is enough to satisfy just about any appetite.  I highly recommend this place for fast, good food.  The only negative, which I'm not counting in the rating as I care most about food, is that there is VERY limited seating.  I'll post a mouth-watering photo asap. :)  Thanks"}
{"text":"Came in for a burrito here after hitting a club downtown.  All I have to say is WOW!  The burrito was very good, very filling and really hit the spot of this Mexican-food-starved ex-San Franciscan.  I absolutely loved it, though the previous alcohol might have skewed my judgement ever so slightly.  Either way, was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Equivalent du Chipotle aux States, Burrito Bandidos permet de combler sa fringale de burrito jusqu'à une heure tardive de la soirée. Grand choix de viandes et sauces, composez vous même votre burrito et attendez 5 à 10 minutes avant de repartir avec votre précieux ou dégustez le sur place."}
{"text":"I ordered the fully loaded large chicken burrito and it was delicious! The people who work there are super nice also. AND they include guacamole in the price which makes me happy. I could barely finish the whole thing! All in all a great place to grab a burrito downtown and for a good price too. The only downside is there is very little seating if you're planning on eating in."}
{"text":"Soupy burrito sadness! I had the sloppiest burrito i've ever experienced at Burrito Bandidos recently. I opted for a whole wheat tortilla TVP veggie burrito (sans cheese/sour cream), and it was just a hot, wet mess. Barely flavourful, either. I've had so many terrific veggie burritos around this city (with either beans or TVP), so I fail to understand how it's so hard to get wrong.   Also, very little seating, or even waiting space - can make it pretty awkward when there's a rush! I was seated eating already and there was a rush and I felt like people were standing right on top of me as I ate.  On the plus side, they're veg-friendly and the portion sizes are decent. That scrapes them through with 2 stars. But it's really not worth the money or my time, even though it's barely a 2 minute walk for me to get there from home. I should know better and go to Big Fat Burrito next time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is Excellent, service is great, guacamole is included! No complaints!"}
{"text":"criteria for a succesful spot in the entertainment district:  1) patrons are drunk or are hungover 2) patrons are wearing club clothes (can also be the morning after) 3) patrons are ok with being jammed up in the smallest space imaginable with 30 other people. 4) you and your brother open up the first kickass burrito spot in the area, then decide to split up, and the open opposing burrito joints 5) serve a halibut burrito (AMAZING)"}
{"text":"This place is basically carry out only, but it's got a very good set of filling choices for their burritos. They're big, they're well made, and if I get back to Toronto sometime, I'd definitely have one again."}
{"text":"Giving it four stars simplybecause restaurant is a little bit quirky otherwise they do pack a mean burrito, one of the best in downtown"}
{"text":"So at first I thought the prices were a little steep for a burrito, but when I discovered the burrito was almost as big as my head, I realized I was getting more than my money's worth.  Now you're wondering if I have a small head or if the burritos are just huge, aren't you?  Well, perhaps you should go and see!   The best part about this is that they don't skimp on your vegetarian options!  FAUX MEAT!  That's right, and they use Yves faux meat, so it's vegan!  Now whenever my group wants a quick but delicious bite to eat, I can offer up something that has something for everyone.   Aye, yii, yii, yiiii, I am de Burrito Bandito.  I like big, fat, burritos, I love them, I do!"}
{"text":"Tried this one after being very disappointed with the service and consistency of the location they have in the beach.  I got to say it is equally as unreliable here as well. The burrito is  basically good, almost the same as burrito boys. But I wouldn't go out of my way to go here the way I have to go to the Burrito Boys on College. Next on my list, Burrito Bastards.... love the name"}
{"text":"Been there many times with the kids. Our favourite Burrito joint by far in the area. Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"4.5 stars actually and I believe this place can get another star from me if they impress me again on my next visit!   I had a small beef burrito, was not small at all! I walked in there with my growling stomach and now I'm happier than ever :P  Not only they have one of the best tasting burritos, their reasonable price sure beats the other tex-mex places i've been in Toronto!   Since yelpers continuously talking about their Halibut burrito, I'll make sure that's what i'm getting on my next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh ingredients and the spicy chicken was very tasty and had a unique flavor which made me not put it down.  I wish they had better burrito places where I am from.  Very jealous of toronto."}
{"text":"Best Burritos in Toronto.  Full of yummy crunchy vegetables and not rice filler.  I usually get the halibut.  You can order off-menu and get it pan-fried rather than deep-fried.  I like that it's halibut and not garbage fish like Tilapia, Basa, Goby, Sculpin, or the other crap the other places use."}
{"text":"Great to finally have a non-hipsterdufus burrito place a little closer to home. Had a large halibut, and it was awesome & huge.   Great fish, fresh veggies,  solid guac, nice & spicy but not ridiculous.  Have since had a Spicy Pulled Pork as well, and it was delicious as well."}
{"text":"G O O D   E X P E R I E N C E: This was my first experience, never had a burrito before this. Amazing first time experience. The place is very clean and everything is presented well. I like that they make it in front of you so you can ask for extras on the stuff you like. I also like that they take phone orders for pick up, defiantly on my new favourites list. Cheap and Cheerful for sure, not so healty, they cut the guacamole with mayo (high bad fat) . U P D A T E :  B A D   E X P E R I E N C E They seem to be very disorganized.  I've become a regular here, at least twice a week (but not anymore). When they are busy, you will either get the wrong order, wait forever or it will be cold because they pull  it off the grill early because they know you been waiting a long time. My last experience (I won't go back), I phoned in my order as I always do to save time, they said ready in 10 minutes as per usual (parking is bad in the area).  I arrived 10 minutes later, the place was busy and they were messing up orders as per usual. I waited for 25 minutes on MY PHONED IN  order .  What they dont tell you is that if you phone in your order, you fall to the bottom of the pile. Personally, I think someone that has you on speed dial might be a regular customer and shouldnt be put to the end of the line.  Im not looking for priortiy, but I expect to be placed in line and not bumped.  I felt I had to say something, I politely commented that they are very disorganized and slow. What a mistake this was. It went from simple comment to crime scene in 10 seconds. The cashier exploded and said that I had no reason to be rude. I replied, I'm not being rude, I'm just tired of waiting and need to get back to work.  He insisted I was being rude so I left without my food.  Go when it is slow and it is good. When it is busy, have lots of time on your hands AND DON'T BE FUSSY, you wont leave with your proper order.  I won't go back  Update:  I did forward my compliant to their head office by way of email and I was very surprised to get a call from one of the owners. He was generally concerned and wanted to apologize and I accepted and later that day I had a call from the store manager, again it seemed very sincere. They knew me well from the short time I was going there as I became a regular. Unfortunately, they have not earned my business back but I do wish them well."}
{"text":"Something keeps bringing me back here, and I always regret it.  The good: the burritos are reasonably priced, and unlike most other chains in the city, they don't have the audacity to charge $3 for a spoonful of guac.  The meats are pretty decent, but they're not drained well so the last inch of the burrito is invariably a soup. That's if it doesn't leak out of the foil wrap and cause a mess.  The grilling is inconsistent. The grill is visible to customers and it looks like they aren't timing them, which explains why the burritos range from lightly toasted to so overdone I have to peel it off.  The ingredients are good, the price point is right, there's just not enough attention paid to the preparation."}
{"text":"Love the burritos here, always delicious and perfect for when you're craving for something that is filling and cheap. Much better than Chipotles..."}
{"text":"Very unsanitary. Food server went from cleaning to making burritos without washing hands. I got food poisoning. Will never eat here again"}
{"text":"We love this place. So glad I don't have to drive all the way to the West end anymore for a good Burrito. I'm a big fan of the halibut, it's well worth the price.  The staff here is always friendly and I would have to say that if you're in a rush call in your order about 10-15 min ahead of time."}
{"text":"Great burritos and great value. These guys make a mean burrito with great ingredients. Best of all, they warm it up so the cheese is nice and gooey, unlike the gross cold burritos at Chipotle. I would say that Burrito Bandidos and Burrito Boyz are the best in the city."}
{"text":"Step 1. Order Halibut burrito. Step 2. ???? Step 3. Profit!  (...er, enjoy!)"}
{"text":"I call in and its ready for pick up in 5 minutes. Love this place. I got hooked on to burritos because of Burrito Bandidos. I usually get the steak and its always tasty. Its honestly one of my favourite go to fast food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic after bar food and/or pre bar food. I ate the small shrimp burrito with all the toppings on whole wheat. Absolutely amazing flavour and it didn't get too messy on the walk home.  Small cramped space but great for meeting new people and sparking conversation.  I thought it was kinda pricey for my budget (came to about ten dollars with tax) but as my budget is small that's being nit picky.   I'LL BE BACK."}
{"text":"I visited Toronto and happened upon this burrito place; holy moley! What a fantastic find, we were only in Toronto for a week and we went back twice! The chicken and mango burrito is something I still crave, and I know when I go back I'll definitely eat there again! And probably bring some for the road trip home!"}
{"text":"Food: 10/10 -- Value: 8/10 -- Service: 9/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 8/10  Sauce and the option to order online are where Burrito Bandidos succeeds.   The halibut burrito bowl ($11.28) was amazing. It was so crispy, with a slightly thicker coating of batter than Burrito Boyz, which I enjoyed. It comes with usual toppings and guacamole at no extra charge. I don't know what sauce was on top of the fish, but it added a depth of flavour that Burrito Boyz doesn't quite have. I also asked for it with zero spiciness so that I could actually taste everything, unlike my last experience with the spicy pulled pork burrito.   The lime Jarritos soda ($2.50) went really well with the bowl, sour enough to cut through some of the heavier ingredients. Jarritos sodas are not twist caps though, so you have to go to the counter where the cashier has a bottle opener.   I ordered my burrito bowl the night before because I knew I would be meeting someone at lunch and it was a really easy process, down to letting me choose the pick-up time. The only thing that would make it even easier would be to let me pay online as well. You have to pay when you get to the counter, which might be frustrating if you just want to grab and go and there's a line.   There's limited seating. A big of a counter/bench by the window and one table for four beside the door.   I haven't had the halibut at Burrito Boyz, but I've had the haddock. I honestly couldn't tell you the difference between the Burrito Boyz haddock and the Burrito Bandidos halibut if I were to compare only the fish underneath the batter. But head to head otherwise, I'd give the win to Burrito Bandidos. They aren't the same price, so they both have their strengths."}
{"text":"Burrito was very tasty and reasonably priced. Staff didn't inspire a lot of positive feelings they were kind of indifferent and I was nervous they were burning my burrito letting it sit on the grill for 10 minutes while I waited. It was worth the wait - lots of flavor and just the right amount of spice!"}
{"text":"My first time there today. Was a great experience from the beginning. You walk in and this cute happy dude takes your order with great music happening. Not too long of a wait, and it was so worth it. Mouth watering. I ordered the shrimp and chicken with all the toppings. Nice and perfectly spicy. Almost didn't find it cause it is behind the A&W on Yonge St. Glad I did."}
{"text":"Cheap, fresh and tasty. A giant burrito filled with everything you could imagine. Extremely filling with the beans, rice and veggies.   Would visit again if I ever go back to Toronto"}
{"text":"It's good if you're drunk and want more than a hot dog. On a regular day, however, it's just very bland"}
{"text":"Amazing burritos - and they aren't afraid to make them spicy. Pretty much a take-out only option; there are a couple seats, but the place is usually *packed*."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. You can get the most awesome hot, tasty burrito if the right staff are on duty, and a cold soggy mess if you show up at the wrong time."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times over the years and while it's still good, the quality of ingredients has gone down since the beginning.  Customer service is virtually non-existent.  Went in the other day to get a burrito and the girl behind the counter was making a burrito which I assume was for a pick-up order or staff member since there were no other customers in the joint.  She didn't look up to acknowledge me for a good 30 seconds and when she did take my order, she was rather curt and looked very displeased to be serving me.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed my burrito but have had a much better experience at the Mississauga location.  The ingredients are fresher, there are more of them, an the staff is quite pleasant."}
{"text":"I'm lucky enough to live right across the street from Burrito Bandidos.  Mmmm...but it gets a little dangerous, at times.  It's not cheap, but it's reasonably priced.  Even the regular bean & cheese is one of the best burritos that I've ever tasted.  It's open 'til 11 (other location opened 'til the wee hours of the morning, but not quite as convenient for me) so it's a great night-time snack.  The bf and I end up at BB 70% of the time when we're out looking for a restaurant to eat. It's just one of those places that you can never say no to.  When all else fails, we go to Burrito Bandidos."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy quick and good tex-mex. I had a small pulled pork burrito (more like extra large!) & steak quesadillas... Both were abs delicious. The hot sauce is like a habanero based cream sauce, also delicious! Very friendly staff & really good r&b music playing. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"ok so we went here for a quick bite before the movies.  it's definitely good for a quick bite but not for groups of more than 3ppl.  good: yummy burritos bad:  not enough seating long wait for the burritos to be ready  but if you come for food tastiness then it's a good choice.  though as was mentioned in one of the reviews below chipotle does a great job with burritos too."}
{"text":"Uh oh. I'm in trouble... I've loved this place for ages, but trips were always reserved for special occasions. Now there's one a short walk away and I wont be able to stay away!  This place has great fresh ingredients, but the burritos taste like burritos, not just the ingredients. This place will beat out chipotle or BFB any day. Especially popular are the fish burritos. Watch for lineups at lunch time. This place is booming and there isn't much seating available, you're usually better taking it to go.  That's my reserved star here....but the food is great!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burrito in Toronto, I always get the large steak/shrimp burrito with everything on it. I've tried so many other place and this is my fav. Me and my buddy are completely hooked on banditos and pretty much almost always end up here when we are both downtown."}
{"text":"consistently good, with high quality ingredients. friendly staff, usually not too long of a wait.   but the main reason... GUAC ISN'T EXTRA."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp while visiting from out of town. Very tasty and well prepared burritos! Love the veggie soya mix!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a hidden gem. I ordered a pair of large burritos. It took about 10 minutes for the culinary artist to produce those delicious belly bombs.   The hot sauce will shock you. Pretty spicy!  The burrito get put together, rolled up and placed on the griddle for a little browning of the shell. Perfection.   Total comfort food."}
{"text":"The veggie soy quesadilla is my favourite order when Tex-Mex cravings come a calling! At just under $10, it is a bit more expensive than the veggie burrito but more flavourful and satisfying. Wouldn't go out of my way to come here but it's a quick, delicious snack/light meal if you're in the area."}
{"text":"One of two restaurants whose number I have stored in my phone. Love grabbing a mango chicken burrito and heading to a Jays game. Never stingy with toppings, the flavour of the sauces is perfect. The music is always great and the staff are attentive and friendly.  I love checking out the Onion articles the print and put on the cork board by the door. The Onion doesn't even distribute in Toronto anymore, but they've kept the tradition alive by printing from the online paper and that small something is a great part of my experience every time I go in."}
{"text":"Excellent burritos: the small is perfectly filling for my small frame; the bean & cheese is perfect for me. But on my last visit, my friend mentioned Burrito Boyz-- which was promptly met with derision. Come on guys, peace, not war! Can't we all get along, and have some burritos?"}
{"text":"Omnom worthy for sure.  Love being able to e-mail them my order and not have to wait for my food.  Love the fish.  Love the toppings.  Wish the place was bigger.  It's a great log of food.  Who doesn't love food in log form?!  TIP: pre-ordering is almost a must at lunch, or be prepared to wait.  Very limited seating as well."}
{"text":"My first encounter with a Toronto burrito was at Burrito Boyz, the chain that was founded by the owner who now owns Burrito Bandidos after having sold his stake in the namesake for B-Boyz.  I decided to give it a try to see which was superior!  I must say that I still think that Burrito Boyz has the superior burrito.  I had originally been exposed to a Halibut Burrito at BBoyz and so this is what I ordered from BBandidos.  I found that the one that BBoyz had a moister halibut, and that the burrito overall was more filling.  Also, the burrito at BBandidos didn't really add anything from a textural perspective and I felt all the flavours kind of got lost in the mix.  My dining companion and I both felt that the burrito could've used a bit more tomato.    The only one-up that BBandidos has is that they will not be anal about not halving your burrito for you like they do at BBoyz.  Seriously?  How long does it take to run a knife through the burrito?  2 seconds?  It amazes me how BBoyz would rather inconvenience a customer for a mere 2 seconds.    Of the 2 burrito establishments I've tried, BBoyz still reigns supreme.  My next stop - the fusion burritos at Chino Locos"}
{"text":"I really like this place: have never been much of a TexMex fan, but my roomate took me to this place and I thought it was great!  The pulled pork, with fresh toppings, hit the spot. Staff was friendly and everything looked clean etc. A Large ran around $8.50 after tax.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My favourite burrito in town, although the prices have been inching up and up and up. The halibut was $8.76, then $9.96, and now $10.40 + tax. Everything else has increased similarly; the once bang-for-your-five-bucks small bean & cheese will run you $6.50.  On the upside, they're still packed to the brim inside a perfectly grilled tortilla, and I usually have enough left over with the large size to start my day off right with an R.B.P. (Reheated Burrito Party).  Lots of options for vegetarians, pescetarians and carnivores alike.  Watch the hot sauce if, like me, you enjoy a bit of heat but like to actually taste your food. I always ask for it very lightly but today it all seeped to the bottom and when I got to the end, through tears, I had to gargle with milk in the office cafeteria. Sexy!"}
{"text":"All I know is, I went here sober for the first time, and it was a much different experience than I remembered it!!!  The bathrooms maybe one of the scarier places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love this place, the burritos are always perfectly crunchy on the outside. I've had the bean and cheese, steak and the chicken burritos so far, they're all good."}
{"text":"Returning to Burrito Bandidos each time feels like a furtive night spent out with an old lover-you know it's bad for you but you want it anways. Hot and heavy, burrito bandidos still churns out the same tasty neat and crisped packets of comfort toronto cal-mex that it's predecessor did, toppings are still the same, they still have the habernero sauce where only a squirt or two will do ya and yummy jumex fruit juice to polish it off.   It's a bad thing and a splendid thing. I go for the halibut."}
{"text":"Was wondering if I would ever find this place as I trudged past the ubiquitous condo developments in this area. Was very pleased when I saw the Burrito Bandidos sign. I descended below street level and ordered a small chicken with everything. Plenty of meat and other delicious fillings. Small was actually quite large. No real place to sit and enjoy it however but it did taste great once I got it to my hotel room. Will return."}
{"text":"This place serves up some of the better burritos in the city.  All of the choices are tasty but my favourites are the shrimp and the bean and cheese.  You can also add mango to any kind of burrito which can be a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great place to grab something for lunch. The small burrito is plenty for lunch and with $7 (tax in) it's a pretty food deal considering its size. The service can be a little slow at lunch when it's busy because they grill everything once it's stuffed in the burrito but this comes with the territory of freshly made fast food.  I'm a big fan, I go once a week probably."}
{"text":"If you like burritos then you will love this place. Fast, friendly service and gigantic, delicious food. The steak quesadillas were some of the best I've ever had and the steak and chicken burrito was the best. Don't let the small underground look steer you away. They even play good music. :)"}
{"text":"This place is very crowded and popular. I waited 20 mins for my burrito, but it was worth it. My steak burrito tasted very good."}
{"text":"Yummy burritos at reasonable price and friendly service. Been here twice but I'm already hooked. Will be back often :)"}
{"text":"Just had some take out of veggie ground large burritos. The service staff were really nice. Being vegetarians we saw how clean they were. Changes gloves all times and even they were filling up supplies. The burritos were slightly burned / overdone probably because they got a call and I guess that did it. The quantity of the filling was amazing. Taste wise it was pretty much the same as Burrito Boyz.  The large one is for a person with big appetite. The hot sauce had less heat than compared to BBoyz. Nice clean place and good staff and I can go back any time"}
{"text":"I ordered a mixed steak and chicken burrito bowl for pick-up through their website, which was nice and convenient! The food was ready when I got there, and service was quick. This location is pretty small with a few bar stools for seating.  The burrito bowl itself tasted great, and there was a generous amount of meat and veggies. I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!!!  I called after uber failed to pick up my order and the restaurant told me I would still have to pay for the food!   I had asked them to remake it as it had been sitting for over 40 minutes and they flat out refused saying someone had to pay for it! They expected me to pay twice for their issue with UBER!  I'll go with one of the 5 other burrito places it's not like the product is that different!!!!  This happened on Jan 21st around 6:20pm!"}
{"text":"It's my birthday and all I want is a tasty burrito from the boyz and girls of Burrito Banditos (the cute blond makes it best).  I loved working nearby, calling in my burrito order and having it ready the moment I dropped in.  Sweet that they always remembered me too. Now I'm in Vancouver and there's nothing to compare.  What I would give for a small bean and cheese, heck it's my birthday, I'd probably splurge on halibut all wrapped up in burrito deliciousness.  If I were in the burrito business I'd get a franchise going on the west coast.  Somebody help me!  I need a good burrito in a bad way!"}
{"text":"Best burrito I've had in Toronto, plus they have a bulletin board containing nothing but articles from the Onion.  I'm also pretty sure they use a mixture of tzatziki and sour cream, which is brilliant."}
{"text":"Burrito bandidos... How I love thee. My favourite is the halibut. Who ever thought of putting fish in a burrito. Actually it wasn't until someone ordered it for me that I tried it. Please try it!!!  Also, get everything, extra chillies if you can take the heat. You can skip the guacamole if you want to cut calories but really, who passes guacamole? Ever?  It's place an order and move on kind of place. They have 4 high top chairs but honestly, there are so many people that it would be a zoo to sit in this basement 200 sq feet place. The best part is that you can call in, order and just pick up and go.   I love joints that have simple menus and who are good at one thing. Can't go wrong after the gym! I mean, you just lost a few calories, this will surely replenish it and then some.  Happy wrapping!!"}
{"text":"The burritos here are terrific, filling, the price is right and the staff is friendly. We order out from here at least once a week if not twice."}
{"text":"used to love this place, the staff were so friendly, and the food was pretty good. But all of my previous visits were in the day, i went in tonight, the music was way too loud, i had to ask the cashier to repeat himself. Turned out he was asking if I called in my order, or am i just ordering. I said I didn't call, he pointed at some girl who was refilling the making station and said, then you need to order with her. So instead of taking my order, and the money I had in my hand, the guy at the cash sent me to the girl who was too busy to take any orders. There were a few guys ahead of m who were also waiting to order. I didn't feel like waiting for everything to be refilled, then for the guys in front of me to order, nor yelling my order over the pumping music, so I left.  Big Fat Burrito is just down the street anyway."}
{"text":"I've had two bad experiences here. My first one was a year ago.  I placed an order for pick up 20 minutes in advance, I show up, pay for my order, they tell me it'll be ready right away.  10 minutes later, I ask where it is (I assumed that they forgot to put my order in when I called it in but wanted to give them a break) but when I asked them where it was, it turns out that hey still hadn't put my order in!!  So that's 40 minutes from when I placed my phone order!   Yesterday, I went there with my husband, my 3 year old and 1 year old. My kids' food was ready right away (small chicken bowl), then they told me that my order was ready but asked us if we wanted to wait for my husbands order too and they'd keep my burrito warm for me and they'd both get called together. (how nice).  A chaotic 20 minutes later of us trying to keep the kids entertained while we waited for my husband's chicken burrito, I walked up to the cook and asked him about my husbands order, it turns out that it was ready, sitting in the back, and he just forgot to tell us!  I asked him \" what happened to letting me know when his burrito was ready?\" \"Oh sorry\" was all he said but in that way to just shut me up, and just turned around and walked away.   Never going back again."}
{"text":"It tastes like Burrito Boyz.   It may not the most authentic (but what do i know)  but its sure tasty.   They have flavours like spicy pulled prok and mango chicken along with the usual toppings and sauces. Its grilled to a crispy crunchy wrap and served in the paper bag.   There is limited seating here and gets busy after 12pm. Its an alternative to burgers."}
{"text":"This is place has an amazing burrito. It's very juicy and tasty. Serving portions are massive. I stopped ordering the large burrito, the small one is too big :)  The cashier is always great. Orders can take a bit longer, food is great and they are still a great crew."}
{"text":"Me and a couple co-workers popped in for some late night eats while we were visiting for business.   Wow. This place is awesome,great portions, tones of options, fresh, flavourful,great prices/value. We all got burrito's and not one of us didn't love them. I had two!!   If I head back to Toronto I will be making a stop here for sure.   This place DESTROYED my Chipotle experience, literally 3x the food for the same $."}
{"text":"Always great food.  Go early - gets busy at lunch. ;)"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet! That's what she said! (Ba dum pum). These guys really know how to make a delicious burrito. The steak and chicken was seasoned perfectly and tasted delicious. There isn't much seating, but I usually do take out. This place can get really busy around lunch time. You can order ahead online I believe. The service was also amazing. Fast and with a smile. :)"}
{"text":"Great food, good burritos, delicious and great service. The portion is big and very filling."}
{"text":"While every other aspect of this restaurant is 5 star quality, from the fresh tortilla and the outstanding guacamole, and friendly servers. The burrito I chose(small steak) had one fault and that is the texture of the meat. However that aside this restaurant is 5 star!!! Hands down"}
{"text":"Call ahead to avoid waiting in the long lunchtime lineups in their cramped basement location. They get to know their regulars quickly and will usher you to the front to pick up your takeout order.   Delicious and fresh made - my favourite is the shrimp!"}
{"text":"Solid Burritos, staff is always friendly, cracking jokes and having a good time, food is freshly prepared in front of you, lots of options. Nothing not to like (except, yea it's a fast-food style place so limited seating, as with many other locations)"}
{"text":"If you want a true yummy burrito this is the place.  The large is huge and is stuffed to the max.   The small is also very big and stuffed to the max!  LOL!  Get napkins because you will have over flow issues.     This place is so good that I walked there while I was 9 months pregnant in super cold February!   If that doesn't say it all... you just don't like burritos like I do!  LoL!  Call your order in ahead of time, this place gets busy and you might have to wait a while if you don't.  Not a place for toddlers, but good for kids that can sit still.  This place is more of  a place to take your order to go.   Bon Appetit! :) Cammy"}
{"text":"I don't know if no one in Toronto has ever had an actual burrito before... There's nothing very burrito-y about these sandwiches. The food here is pretty damn good, these are great sandwich wraps- these are not burritos, and I'm surprised that they've won best burrito in Toronto because seriously, I have never had a burrito like this. And I have had a fair share of burritos back home in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago, deep in the heart of Texas, and honestly, it's one of my favorite foods, i try to pick it up any city I go to, including Berlin, Riyadh, and Beijing (the weirdest burrito ever).  Again, it's a great place to grab a hearty bite, although their salsa comes in those costco-sized jugs (you can tell) and seriously, I'm not sure what the sauce combination is in these things (it's good, but mysterious). It's just not a burrito. It's a really good wrap though. I'd recommend the Steak burrito on wheat, pretty delicious.  Onto the service: They're very quick, and even when the lunch crowd is heading in they're extremely good about keeping the line moving (and have never messed up my order! I've been here a good few times). They staff is courteous and is good about shepherding the crowd without sounding annoyed about it (it's a small store, maybe five stools and one bench to sit on, there's also a picnic bench outside for when the weather's good).  I'd recommend it, pretty highly. I approach this place the way I approach Soy Milk- I don't think of it as milk, but i find it really yummy all the same. They're not serving burritos, but they're serving some pretty darn good tex-mex themed sandwiches. Try it, you won't be sorry :)  Oh! Also, before I forget! To avoid the lineup you can call in your order a few minutes ahead, it's a nice quick option for if you already know what you want (all their ingredients and combos are available on their website, so it's good for first timers too)"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Though it's a small location it's a gem tucked away just off of bloor and walmer. Seating is very limited but in the summer there are tables out front so it isn't too bad."}
{"text":"A pig has died and went to heaven. However, it felt that it had some unfinished business , so it got pulled back down to earth to become one of the best pulled pork burritos the world has NEVER seen. Thank you Burrito Bandidos for fulfilling this little pig's dream and overloading my taste buds."}
{"text":"Fresh and authentic and made to order. So good. Friendly server made our sandwich right in front of us. No line up on weekend visit."}
{"text":"I was around the Bloor-Spadina area and came across this joint and thought I would give it a try. firstly, I said the Steak/Shrimp and it wasn't until I got home, I realized it was the wrong order (Steak/Chicken). Other than the fact that the burrito was alright, after finishing eating it did I start to have stomach pains. I thought the pain would go away the next morning but never did ...I continued to have more pains the entire day and even up to now as I write this review. I believe the meat wasn't cooked right as I can tell it was chewier than usual. Only unless I want to get what I presume to be food poisoning ...I will definitely not be going back"}

{"text":"Extremely slow service. Waited 30 mins for two orders.  Will not come back again. Worst burrito place in town."}
{"text":"This is my second favourite burrito place. It's always yummy. I love the pulled port naked burrito with all the toppings. The hot sauce has a wonderful flavour. And the staff is always smiling. A great place to visit when all you want is a good meal"}
{"text":"It was kind of expensive but the small chicken with everything on it literally made my hangover Sunday haha I will DEFINATLEY be back here! :) fast & curtious service too!"}
{"text":"These burritos are delicious. The pulled pork isn't so great, it was a little dry. Shrimp and chicken is my favourite so far."}
{"text":"The thing about a good burrito is the flavors need to mesh together to make something wonderful, as well as filling. Burrito Bandidos doesn't quite pull it off.   Their burrito is good. I'll even go as far as pretty good, but it doesn't reach that level of greatness I had hoped for.   If I can get a better burrito in the suburbs at a chain like Mucho Burrito, something's wrong.   I got a steak burrito with everything on it. As the friendly staff packed my massive meal into the tortilla, I was salivating. Once I took a bite, my hunger was satisfied, but not my anticipation.   A very ok burrito, but not something I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"good : delish fresh food!!!/ huge potion/ good price bad : uncomfortable seats/ they don't serve tap water(must buy beverages)"}
{"text":"This was the place that first introduced me to burritos, back when it was still Burrito Boyz. Post split how are they faring? Judging from the lunchtime crowds pretty darn good. They were my introduction to and still my favourite burrtio joint when I get that hankering for tex-mex.  From day one I've always gotten the vegetarian option. Not because I'm vegetarian, mainly because it's the cheapest burrito and I'm a cheapskate (a vegetarian option that's cheaper, madness!) and I'm actually quite impressed by the taste. Large goes for $6.10 and what you get is a something that is simply stuffed with all sorts of fixins. It's pretty much what you expect from a burrito, lettuce, diced tomatoes, refried beans, etc. but the reason I like BB's better then everybody elses is that they also use seasoned ground round which has texture very similar to ground beef so it's that little extra bit of texture that sets it apart.  Plus a large is massive, I'm eating it and eating it and and I'm just thinking to myself \"where's the end of it?\" I actually skip dinner because of it, for realz.  The place is tiny (the waiting area is about the size of a bathroom) so it does get a little cozy but the wait is made tolerable by the clippings from The Onion they posts up.  Everybody I've introduced to BB's has loved it and I just found out their opening a new Yonge St. location just two blocks from home so of course I'm chuffed to bits."}
{"text":"Great chicken mango burrito. Staff very friendly and prompt.  Only wish is the guacamole was fresher."}
{"text":"I really love burritos and we happened to come across this place walking home and decided we would give it a shot. i got a chicken burrito with al the fixings. Now the guy told me that the hot sauce was really hot, but as usual i think i can handle more hot sauce then i really can and said go with the hot stuff. My boyfriend warned me. Well as a result It took me twice as long to finish the burrito. The guy was laughing at me cause he said he warned me, it was all in good humour but i told him i still enjoyed it as i chugged a milk back lol I mean you cant really go wrong with burritos.... this place is good"}
{"text":"Poor service and angry, miserable staff. When ordering in person, they make it with everything without asking what toppings you want."}
{"text":"NOT the best burrito I have had in the city, Fat Bastard definitely takes the prize. But very good.  Fresh ingredients - they have all the usual: guac, lettuce, tomatoes, jalapeños, i got the fish which was BEYOND delicious and there was a lot, perfectly battered and fried.  I also like the fact that they have choices of size. Go for the extra large or you will always wonder what could have been...  The actual inside of the restaurant is pretty small, maybe 12-16 seats? I would suggest getting take out."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Large, filling and absolutely delicious.  Quick service and a couple of tables if you want to eat there.  All orders are made fresh in front of you.  And for some entertainment they have different newspaper clippings and articles on the wall that are wacky and outrageous.  A great read while you're waiting for your mouth watering, never disappointing, fulfilling meal."}
{"text":"Visiting UT. Needed good lunch and found it. AWESOME! Super tasty. Fresh ingredients, great rice, peppers rock, and the owner is really cool. Great place for lunch. Even the music is great."}
{"text":"Saw multiple reviews on this place saying this is the best burrito in town so I figured I was in the area and would give it a try.  You can actually order online and pick it up at the restaurant if you are ever in a hurry and didn't want to wait. I came on a Thursday evening around 6pm, there was no line and no wait, basically ordered my food and it was ready in around 10mins or less.  The menu is posted on the wall, very small menu for choice but good enough for what they offer. You can choose your burritos with, chicken, mango chicken, pulled pork, steak, vegetarian, halibut, or they also have ones with 2 meats in them, like chicken and steak, etc.  They offer 2 sizes, a small and large, choice between white or whole wheat tortilla. At first when I was the bag that holds the large, I thought it would be small. But as I saw them put the burrito together, they definitely don't cheap out on the ingredients. They give a handful of ingredients that go into the burrito as well as a big spoon on guacamole. Usually most places will charge you extra for guacamole but this place didn't!  If you want it hot, they put a good portion on jalapenos and hot sauce which makes it quite spicy!!   The size which it came out to was fairly big, I shared half with a friend and I'm glad I did because it filled us both up well! The cost of it was around $10 which was a good deal!  Will definitely be coming back if we're in the area and wanting to save money on a filling meal!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best burritos I have ever had.  I've tried both the steak and chicken burritos several times and both are very satisfying.  The ingredients all seem to be very fresh, the sauces are tasty and the meat quality is better than what you usually get at other burrito places.  Another minor thing that burrito bandidos does very well (which is actually a big deal to me) is the fact that they actually toast their burritos on the grill for a good period of time after wrapping them up but before giving them to you.  This ensures that the burrito is slightly crispy on the outside and heated thoroughly on the inside.  I've tried other burrito places where they give you the burrito without doing this and some of the filling tastes cold, which is disgusting.  The pricing is a little bit more expensive than some other burrito places and the actual burrito itself seems to be slightly smaller than the competitors, but the quality and the taste that you're paying for is well worth the slight increase in price.  Highly recommended for any fans of mexican food."}
{"text":"While named for burritos, the menu also has quesadillas.    You can order two sizes.  Even the small burrito is quite large.  Choices include white or wheat tortillas and ingredients include refried beans and rice, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, onions and hot peppers, plus sauces.    Main ingredients were the usual chicken, steak and shrimp, but they also have halibut and pulled pork.  I must have been tired when I ordered the pork, as I had carnitas in mind, not the new trendy BBQ sauce-laden meat.  I let them put all of the ingredients in the burrito (sans onion and hot pepper).  This was quite quick.  After the ingredients are chosen is where it slows down.  The burrito goes to a grill to be charred outside, which takes some time.  The space inside is quite small, so it was a bit of shuffling whenever someone came in.  I thought the burrito was tasty, but it wasn't what I wanted, so I only finished half of it.  Next time I'll be more cautious and order a different main ingredient."}
{"text":"Perfectly good burritos but they won't even give you a glass of water, really? The staff was embarrassed to admit it, management's orders, I guess. Lame. Sell me a cup, even, not a stupid overpriced bottle."}
{"text":"A really good burrito. Made quickly to order. I had the steak and I have to deduct a star for finding too many \"chewy\" bits I had to spit out. Docking another star because there's almost no seating. There's lots of competition in the mega burrito domain these days unless you're looking for some place close and getting take out, there's little reason to cross the city or even the street to get a burrito here."}
{"text":"See the Burrito Boyz review for a walk-thru on how to order. That a simple burrito stand needs a rather complicated set of instructions says something about this place. Not fully positive. Everyone has a different metric for what's good Mexican food, I find. Those who have lived all their lives in Toronto have markedly different standards from those who have lived, say, in Texas, So-Cal, San Fran's Mission District, Detroit (Detroit has a great Mexican town, believe it), or Leamington (as in Ontario as in a farm town as in they have a lot of Mexican fieldhands as in many of them stick around in the off season and open up great authentic taco stands) . Burrito [insert current name] was okay based on my experience with Mexican chow in places south of the Rio Lake Ontario.   I found this place profoundly frustrating the first, and only time, I paid a visit. Where to order, where to pay your money, where to get your food, how to get your food, when you should come up and get your food, is all non obvious.  Once you figure it all out, it's a long wait to get your chow and I didn't even go during crunch time. I can't imagine tolerating this place during lunch or after club hours.   Taste, quality, value etc. are pretty okay, especially for mex/tex-mex food in Toronto which is just a dismal and depressing experience in any case. Why a city can play host to restaurants that serve up some excellent world cuisine but for 20 years can't get a single good authentic taco stand going is beyond me.  All 'n' all, I'd probably go back for the chow but the whole ordering/fulfillment process just left me irritated and I'd just rather hit Subway and spare myself the grief."}
{"text":"After years of loyalty to big fat burrito I finally tried burrito bandidos and was very impressed. I got the chicken and shrimp burrito and made sure they put in extra cilantro. I loved what i got even though it got a bit cold by the time i got home. I loved the taste of the burrito sauce as well that added the extra zing and rounded up the flavor so well. Im sure this is sacrilege but i prefer the chicken and shrimp to the ground beef. It had a lot more taste to it and didn't make me feel overly stuffed. There is very limited space to sit down and eat so its probably vest to get take out."}
{"text":"Overall a decent buritto, but the meat seems a little dry... But if you get extra burrito sauce it will even out!"}
{"text":"Good drunk food, but nothing more.  And sadly, they are in such a rush to take orders, that I can never seem to order without messing something up or forgetting to take off the sour cream.   To be fair, I'm also from California, so I have high standards for burritos, even late night ones."}
{"text":"Best burritos in the city hands down.  You can tell they cut their ingredients fresh, their meat is cooked nice and juicy and the burritos are grilled to perfection.  A couple of things missing: corn and nachos."}
{"text":"If you're craving a burrito the size of a newborns' head, this is your place.   My fav is bean & cheese, very close runner up is the Halibut.  I always opt out of the green peppers (they're obscenely generous with them), and anything hot (no hot sauce or jalapeños), and it's still really darn tasty.   The place can get super busy, so I highly recommend you call your order in. Yeah, just don't forget the order # they tell you. *Not that I'm talking from experience or anything .....   TIP: The \"restaurant\" (and by that, I mean a wall of bar seating) is really cramped. It's underground. Not suitable for the claustrophobic.  Or those over 6'6\"."}
{"text":"I do not know why this business has such high ratings!  Love the location, but have to say there are far better burrito restaurants not far away.  I say hop back on the street car and head a few blocks either east or west on Queen St. E. for a shot at really great burritos."}
{"text":"This is definately one of the best burrito in town! It tastes fresh and the combination of spices is unique! The mango and chicken one is my favorite! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few burrito joints in the city. None compare to Burrito Bandidos. Perhaps because it was my first ever burrito joint in the city since moving here? I'm not sure. But boy howdy, it's my favorite!   A large is very large.. I often don't finish it, so I fry up the left overs for breakfast in the morning. During lunch or dinner times, it's super busy. I always call ahead. It's worth it - I promise.   Listen to the other reviewers... The fish (halibut) burrito is something to admire. Very special and delicious, indeed."}
{"text":"Great option if Burrito Boyz is just too far or you're about to faint from starvation.  I love wraps - they fit in my hand and mouth perfectly and practically mess free. I love it even more that the proportion is just PERFECT and the waiting time is NOT ridiculous at all.  This place however, remains my second choice after Burrito boyz. Only because they're a little more - and because they don't have that great big selection of seafood burritos (I don't think I can get a Halibut burrito in small size).  It is a little bit on the cramped side so eating in - although the option is available, is really only for show. Don't do it; your enjoyment will be fully      interrupted by the poor starving souls trying to get to their food...  I'm not sure if anyone's smiled or engaged with me at all, although listening to their conversations are interesting."}
{"text":"Having been here a bazillion times, forgot that I should really give it an ace score/review here on Yelp! It's a really great, hearty and super tasty burrito place. Period.  Seriously, if you're ever in this neck of the woods and are looking for something good to eat that isn't fast food, or sushi...try this joint! Super great eats!"}
{"text":"The tastiest take-out food I've had... ever? Well no, maybe not ever - but it's pretty damn close.   They have a wide selection of burritos here, ranging from the bean & cheese (a large is only $6!) to more interesting fare like halibut and shrimp. There are only two or three seats, so this is primarily a take-out joint, and a standard order will take at least 5 minutes to prepare, if not a touch longer.  I had the chicken - and it was great. They put A LOT in there - tomatoes, peppers, onions, beans, cheese, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, jalapenos and just a touch of what tastes like a habanero-based sauce. After tax, it was under $8 and left me full for hours. It's just good - the burrito had a great balance of flavour and texture and really, for take-out, what more can you ask for?  This is the real deal - well-priced, well-made, delicious food. Go!"}
{"text":"Favourite burrito in Toronto. Hands down. Halibut gets me every time. Damnnnn. I want one right now."}
{"text":"Awesome burrito. Had a large steak and the thing actually had heft. Tasty, fresh with just a hint of cilantro. Needed more hot sauce but that was my fault. Two jalapeños up!"}
{"text":"I feel in love with this place!!!!   My wife brought home a steak burrito for me claiming it was way better then chipotle. Well it was and still is.  For the same price as chipotle I get everything i want and didnt have to pay extra for guacamole. I love how its all juicy and the sauce drips from the burrito and how they warm it up just before giving it to you so the chesse is nice amf warm.  To be honest the only part I didnt like i was there yesterday and their hot sauce isnt freshly made but comes from a bottle but still loving this place and I will keep going."}
{"text":"Taste: since I'm from LA, I can't help think that the burritos here in Toronto are a bit weird. Still tastes great, but there is no attempt to aim for Mexican or Tex-mex. For instance, there are chopped green scallions and raw bell peppers in the standard burrito. Not conventional at all. Having said that, it still tastes great, and I still ask them to put all the stuff in. hahaha  Portion: I always get a large burrito and for a guy, it does me ok. I also like to take the burrito home and bust out some Tostidos and salsa (because they don't have any tortilla chips?!), so the burrito itself isn't a complete fill.  Price: I think the burrito is overpriced by a few bucks for what it is, but there are no better options in this area, so I'll continue to go to BB.  taste would give them 4 stars, knocked down to 3 stars for price/value."}
{"text":"I'm done with mediocre burrito places. Both Burrito Bandidos and Burrito Boyz.   I'm sure someone will read this and tell me once again \"Have you tried the halibut burrito? It's so awesome!\". Frankly, shut your face. If I'm going to have a burrito I'm going to have meat. If I wanted fish, I would go to The Combine and get their awesome fish tacos.  So let's talk about last night's experience. The girl taking my order couldn't get it right. I had to repeat myself at least twice on each ingredient. If she had just taken a breath, finished the one burrito she was working on then moved onto mine, it would have been fine. They weren't that busy, take your time, slow down, and provide some customer service.  You get a scoop of beans, fine, but I don't really like eating some slop that looks like cat food. Where's the choice? Give me some black beans. Next they put on a few kernels of rice which quickly get absorbed by the bean slop and are gone forever. Now that I've tried this type of burrito a couple times before I had the foresight to skip the lettuce so that I wouldn't have a warm green mush of what used to be lettuce once they grill my burrito.  Compared to other places they don't charge extra for quac, which is nice, except that you get about a tablespoon of it. I would rather pay the extra like at Chipotle and have enough guac so that I could actually tell there was some on my burrito. They're also chintzy with the sour cream, one quick squirt, that's all you get.  I'll give them props on the amount of meat. I got a decent portion of pork, though the flavour could have been a little more outstanding.  The girl behind the till was friendly and smiley. Good job! Wish I had grabbed her name so that I could call her out here.  Bandidos is the right name for this place since I felt pretty robbed when I got through the till. $9 got me the small pork burrito and a chocolate milk. Portion wise, I would say this is a fair price. Quality wise, it is far from it. Which brings me to my next point of the enjoyment (or lack there of) of my burrito.  As I walked home I tore off the top half of the wrapping to discover a HEAVILY grilled burrito. So not only did I get the taste of burnt tortilla in some of my bites, after a couple bites in the tortilla cracked open and started leaking everywhere. What I found on the inside of my burrito was bean slop and pork with little chunks of bell peppers. All of the other ingredients in the burrito had become unidentifiable.  Finally, let's talk about the time factor. There were about 5 people ahead of me when I walked in. After waiting 15 minutes I got the silver wrapper of what this place calls a burrito in my hand. Why does it take so long? Get a clam-shell grill or a panini press, or a convection oven to toast the burritos with. The technology exists to cook both sides of the burrito at the SAME TIME!!  Let's sum things up in some easy to read pros and cons:  PROS:  - Good portion of meat - Benches to sit on while you wait an extraordinary amount of time for your food - Friendly girl at the cash register  CONS:  - EVERYTHING ELSE!"}
{"text":"i can't say enough amazing things about burrito bandidos. it's my fav burrito and i eat one at least once a week, and shamefully probably more than that.   all the toppings are assembled in a vertical row, meaning that when all that goodness is rolled up, you get the same delicious flavours in every bite which is really important to me. nothing worse than taking one amazing bite of a burrito and then the next bite is all rice.   I always get shrimp, or chicken and shrimp and would highly recommend either. Also, for the health conscious burrito enthusiast, skip the sour cream and cheese! Just make sure to say yes to burrito sauce and you really won't miss all those extra calories.   make sure to tip the staff at this wonderful establishment, they never fail to deliver! also they only kinda made fun of me when i lamely showed them on my phone that i was the duchess of this location..."}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  Grabbed a halibut burrito and it was sufficiently big and flavourful enough for it's price point ($11.25 after taxes).  Pro-tip: Be sure to call ahead before picking up your order.  The line-ups are quite long and they take a while to make your massive burrito."}
{"text":"Big burritos are delicious, but they make me tired. Like ultra tired. I had the shrimp burrito, and it was delicious - however, I warn you now, prepare for a huge mess. I'm not the most elegant eater, so it was pretty funny.  I wish the halibut burrito came in a small though. Oh well."}
{"text":"It's a good place to pick some burritos and quasesdias. I would recommend takeout only as they have minimal seating space."}
{"text":"When I forget my Lunch, I walk over and grab a Burrito. Or a Quesadilla. When I am walking by on Yonge street, I grab dinner at their Groverson location.  When I am at Spadina and Bloor, I buy a Burrito and pig out on that Bench outside! I love their Burritos. They are a good value.   I love Chicken and when I want something really spicy, the Pulled Pork. I remember the Halibut Burrito being good but the Halibut Quesadilla is passable.   I have tried Burrito Boys but I tell you this place is better."}
{"text":"Hi folks - I am surprised I am the first person reviewing this new location of Burrito Bandidos.  I am a fan of the Peter Street location, and they now have a location at Queen and Coxwell. Fantastic to have  a good Burrito spot in the Beach.  Location has some tall stools with counters.. so you can eat in (at least about a dozen people can).  More spacious than the Peter Street location for sure - neat retro feel too.  Good selection of burritos and quesadillas. I am still a big fan of the Steak burrito -- you can get small or large.  The small is good for me - but the hubby had the large (lots of eating).  You can pick from rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, green pepper, green onion, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, salsa, burrito sauce, spicy sauce, jalapenos (I am sure I missed something but you get the picture).  You can pick for the meat - chicken, beef, halibut, pulled pork, chicken/beef and other options.  They have white or whole wheat tortillas.  They put it all together and then grill it so it is nice and hot.  Yummmmmmmmm-a-LICIOUS! Same good burritos as the Peter Street location. Yep -- that's what I am talking about! Good selection of drinks including the Pellegrino Limonata, Blood Orange etc.  So - get yourself down to the Beach and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Quite a selection of burritos, and for $12 you get a large burrito and a drink. Ready very quickly, I got the chicken burrito and my buddy a steak burrito. The combination of flavours and toppings goes very well, and makes for a very quick fix for lunch or dinner! There's little to no seating, so be prepared to get your order to go."}
{"text":"To Jadon H review. You are full of shit! The owner is one of the nicest most engaging people I have ever met in the fast food industry.  He takes his company very seriously to the point he purchased a new machine for pressing the burritos and wasn't sure about the quality it was producing.   He asked me to try it out (burrito on the house) and to call in and let him know how it was.  I gave honest feed back and said the flat top was much better. He got rid of it right away.  I doubt he would break the laws of proper food handling. I think you were just having a bad day and need to lash out!   I have been coming here for years and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"You know what really grinds my gears? Burritos that are assembled without any care, so that you wind up with a concoction devoid of internal consistency. (Meaning that some bites are just rice, others are just meat, etc, etc.)  I walked into the joint around 5:00 on a weekday and ordered a small steak burrito on white with everything (and extra spicy, of course). It was ready a few minutes later and I decided to chow down while walking.  So, getting back to my aforementioned rant, the first few bites of the burrito consisted entirely of steak. I will admit that the balance improved somewhat from there, but the steak was never as plentiful as it was in those first mouthfuls.  Still, I enjoyed this burrito. It's quite flavorful and the level of spice was decent. The burrito was solidly put together and it never once seemed to be falling apart. (Try saying that about a burrito at the always-terrible Chipotle chain.)"}
{"text":"I got a small steak w/ chicken burrito, I have to say their small burrito was sooo big that can totally fill you up (unless you're a very heavy eater). The tortilla wrap was so crispy and the meat inside was packed with flavours. tbh I like this place more than burrito boyz, will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Outstanding value! I love the steak and chicken burrito. The portions are HUGE (I have trouble finishing the small).   Having a hot burrito really does make a huge difference.   If you like it spicy make sure you push them to really kick it. Their extra spicy burritos are really pretty tame."}
{"text":"Got the large veg burrito on wholewheat, everything on it and spicy = awesome. If they had more salsa and cilantro that would be perfect."}
{"text":"Great Burritos. They need to get whole wheat though! Also, they can sometimes be overzealous with the Jalapeños, so it may be good to ask for a level lower than you normally ask for!"}
{"text":"For the past month, I've bought a burrito here on average of 2/3 times a week.   Yeah, it's that good.  To be honest, I'm not very fussy about my burritos. I don't know what an 'authentic' burrito is, and I don't care. All I know is that these particular ones are DELICIOUS. I've tried the spicy pulled pork, the vegetarian, the halibut, the chicken and the steak. My favourite is the pulled pork, but the halibut comes close (only available in large).   Price-wise, maybe it's a bit on the pricier side, but I find it hard to regret spending the money when it's so consistently good and I am so consistently satisfied."}
{"text":"Nommers, a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. Despite the smattering of z-teca/Chipotle/BarBurrito in the area, there's something about Bandidos that makes it stand out from the rest. (My guess is the \"burrito sauce\" - no clue what this actually is.)  Service was quick and efficient, and much faster than I remember it being at Burrito Boyz (the Adelaide one). Ordered the shrimp burrito, which I thoroughly enjoyed; the small was more than enough for a lunch. Beware the hot sauce, which doesn't fool around.  Seating is present, but limited and rather tight. Get it to go, and perhaps head over to Queen's Park to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I live nearby so we ate here numerous times but in the past few months, they've gone down the drain. I was hoping my bad experiences were rare but they turned out not to be. On one occassion, our burritos were poorly constructed, fell apart and leaked through the wrappers. But this wasn't the worst.  I ordered a burrito without cheese and sour cream for someone that's lactose intolerant and I clearly stated that over the phone, yet it still contained cheese and sour cream. They even labelled the bag as \"no dairy\". They reimbursed me and gave me a free order for the next time so I decided to give it a chance and 2 weeks later, I placed the exact same order. This time the burrito didn't contain dairy but they put it in the wrong bag and incorrectly labelled my bag as non-dairy.   Absolutely careless and incompetent staff! I won't even bother complaing to them again. We obviously will no longer eat there and my advice is to avoid this place unless you don't care about getting your order right."}
{"text":"The chicken mango burrito filled cravings I didn't know I had. Will definitely be returning in the future"}
{"text":"Tried the halibut this time and it was so delicious. Definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"Mmm spicy, fully loaded halibut burrito. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"so yummy...fast service...great food...what more could you ask for?? I did have everything on my chicken burrito..which I won't the next time as it was just a tad heavy with jalapenos! Spice-O-rama!"}
{"text":"Burrito way too hot for mild. Restaurant was clean. Pop was cold. Nice atmosphere. Decorated well. Staff are friendly but don't check well on customer heat levels."}
{"text":"I use to live at the end of the block from where this place is, the burritos are excellent no matter which one you get. The staff there is wonderful and help all new comes to the place. It is really small in there so take your burrito to go or make sure you grab a seat if they are available. Try the mixed burritos or my favorite the steak burrito."}
{"text":"So it's Sunday night, I've recently moved and haven't bothered grocery shopping yet, it's pushing 9 p.m. and I realize dinner probably makes a lot of sense.  After deliberating for far too long about what I was in the mood for (and in turn, limiting my options considerably as the longer I peruse menus online, the more shops are closing) I finally realize burritos are always a good idea.  Then I find out the genius behind Burrito Boyz is behind this place, then I find out they have a halibut burrito AND they're actually open until 11 p.m. on Sunday and I'm beyond sold on this place.  So I face the cold and head out for some burrito bliss.   I'm asked if I'm OK with spicy and if I want everything on it - yes and yes.  After about 10 minutes I'm walking back home with what feels like 5 pounds of burrito in my purse which I am seriously debating ripping into as I walk (okay, I'm practically jogging at this point) up Yonge.  I finally get it home and am pleased with how it's got a great crisp to the tortilla from being put on the grill after it's all made so the outside is all browned and awesome.  I dig in and am officialy in love.  Everything was fresh, the halibut was ah-mazing, the only complaint/reason I didn't give it 5 stars is every so often I would get a bite that was obscenely salty (I'm a pretty big fan of salt and it threw me) I'm assuming it was from some spice not being mixed into something enough, perhaps the beans?  I don't really know, but it definitely tasted like I was getting pockets of seasoning salt in the occasional bite.  Anyway.  This aside, it was a ridiculously amazing burrito, and could have easily been two meals (although I obviously had it as one - if you can find me someone who is actually able to put down a burrito half way through the deliciousness, my mind will be blown.)   Burrito Bandidos, ya nailed it."}
{"text":"This was once the best Burrito place I had ever been to.......  The food was always fresh, quality control was job#1 until today.......  My group ordered 3 burritos (pretty simple eh?) one was specifically stated to have absolutely no hot sauce or peppers whatsoever.  Well 1 burrito was done well with an exception I will follow up with at the end.  The other 2x were completely screwed up and my colleague received the blazing hot sauce 2x lines of it and spicy salsa......  For those that may not know how bad this was...... his condition is no different than someone with peanut allergies that can die if they so much as ingest a single gram of it......  When a patron is accustomed to a vendors work they manifest a form of \"Trust\" that the vendor will never screw up 3/4 of the order........  My burrito was bland with no flavor at all..... pulled pork with no spice or hot sauce is well...... tasteless. My colleague however is being rushed to the hospital.........  The 1st burrito eventually made my colleague sick as well........ I did not eat mine because it was screwed up and bland.  We called immediately to advise them of the horrendous error and wow........ \"I am sorry\", was the excuse and further \"we are pretty busy here today\" oh wait there is more \"well if you ever decide to come back there is a free burrito in it for you......\" ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME???????  By the way, that was the manager speaking, he needs to be fired along with the moron that screwed up the order along with the person that quality controls these before going out for human consumption.  Another colleague of mine had the fish Burrito.... he was violently ill for the entire evening as the edges of the fish filet within were dry and the center was undercooked and wet...... more complaints grew from more of my colleges that I wont bother putting down now......  FYI..... wait for the health inspector to come along with the formal lawsuit pending the outcome of the one you sent to the hospital.   R.I.P. Burrito Bandidos = 6+ patrons to never return."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Ordered a chicken naked burrito. Serving was massive! Sauce had the perfect balance of 'garlicky' taste. I was able to make 3 meals it of it. I did find some of rice that seemed really hard like it was a bit old..but nothing to stop me from eating it."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting anything great when it comes to Mexican food outside the US. This place is surprisingly above par with their choice of tortillas, wheat or white. I went ahead with wheat and order a larger burrito with chicken and steak. The portion is still a little small for a \"large burrito\", perhaps it's a Canadian sized. Again, $10 for something you normally pay half in your hometown is a bit of a heartbreak, but it's ok, Canadian dollars are cheaper now so I won't complain. The service is quite slow and if you are in a hurry, you should go to Chipotle."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been coming here for years and today made the decision to stop. Chicken burrito was both tasteless and the meat tasted cheap. Friends quesadilla was steak and it was super chewy and the texture seemed like it was over cooked and then reheated several times. They need to reevaluate the cooking or maybe they changed the supplier of their meats? Either way not too happy :("}
{"text":"My main recommendation with Bandidos is do takeout. The seating at the restaurant isn't particularly attractive and their food is perfectly good wrapped up to go. I tried their bean & cheese burrito bowl and my friends got bean & cheese burritos. We enjoyed them but all agreed that there was just too much cheese. The burritos fit the spot but weren't exactly memorable. I'll probably be back for a late-dinner the next time I'm in Toronto but mainly because it's cheap and open till 2am !  P.S. they have the most hilarious onion articles posted on a bullitein board to keep you entertained as you wait!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place a coveted 5 stars sheerly because I don't even like burritos/bowls and I was blown out of the water. This makes chipotle look like not even food. There was so much more flavour, plus free guac. I got the chicken and steak mix but il definitely be back to try the halibut after reading all the previous reviews."}
{"text":"They provide a humorous collection of The Onion newspaper clippings on their walls while you wait for your order to be served. The burritos are also very delicious, in particular the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Sooo i went back here and things seem to be in order now.  Finally, the same Burrito Boys taste, brought to the Annex.  Something was up before but these guys seem to have figured out and corrected whatever it was that was sooo terribly wrong.    If you havent already been to Burrito Boyz or Burrito Bandidos, go check em out!"}
{"text":"Got a chicken/steak burrito with everything except hot sauce and jalapenos on it. I should have just skipped lunch today because,boy was this ever a huge mistake. Completely mediocre bordering on inedibly bad burrito, seriously one of the most disgusting burritos I have ever eaten. I have no idea why my colleagues rave about this place.  I wound up throwing half of it away after chocking down the first half out of ravenous hunger.   To their credit, the service was friendly and efficient, making it an integral lunch place for those who work in the Annex. Especially those like myself who want a change of pace from the eleven thousand sushi restos in the area. I however won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices.  Product always seems fresh.  Try one the burritos with shrimp."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch. I usually call ahead and arrange for pick up and have enjoyed almost every single burrito I've ordered here.  They charge extra for burrito sauce but it's well worth it, especially if your order the veggie soy (they have sometimes given me a painfully dusty veggie soy burrito that was as dry as wood chips!)  But otherwise a nice spot for a quick and dirty afternoon treat."}
{"text":"My go to Mexican place. I have been to a few Mexican joints in TO and this one has been my favorite so far. I believe their Annex location is a bit better in terms of food quality.  Don't just try burritos, the other option (quasadia !?!) Is great too. Actually the last three times I've been there it's been the favourite option. It's more spacious compared to their Annex location, so it's better if you wand to eat there. Nice decor by the way, and their red colored walls makes you hungry, I've heard :-))"}
{"text":"Great burrito, reasonable price, friendly staff.  I had the mango chicken and it was great.  Will be going back for the steak next time.  Unfortunately the halibut only comes in large size, and that it way too much food."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a snack or a meal! I never get sick of their shrimp burritos. I think the sauce tastes particularly great with shrimps.  I also like the mango chicken but the amount of thin, chopped mango slices are not just enough for me. Try with extra mango serving, if you dare..  Not a big fan of halibut burrito which is the most expensive. They should indicate that it is FRIED halibut. The steaks are a bit salty sometimes.  Try to order ahead (online or by phone) if you're in a hurry, it takes about up to 10 min (for one burrito) if you order on the spot.  Also keep it mind that cilantro is one of the toppings, which many people hate and which I love."}
{"text":"This place is an 'alright' burrito joint.   The sizing is massive. Gigantic, even. The service is also quite friendly, so if you're looking for a bean/cheese/meat/tortilla hit, this is the place to go. The food is quick and the smiles are broad.  That being said, you better have a steel stomach. Or at least not sensitive. I had the pulled pork quesadilla and it did not love me later on. Like so many places, when you're getting a massive portion of something, the quality gets sacrificed. The food is still pretty tasty, but nothing to write home about.  Last comment -  they should consider a different way to package up quesadillas for takeout. They stack them up on top of each and the grease ends up pooling on top of each slice. Not great..."}
{"text":"Good, but not my kind of thing.  The burrito is kind of big.  taste good and fresh.  Just not my type of burrito.  The burrito had too much guacamole for my liking.   Maybe this is a TeX Mex thing.  I'm just use to burritos with more rice.  Its more filling for me."}
{"text":"My husband has been raving about how great the burritos are at Burrito Bandidos so I decided to give it a try.   The place itself is small. There is not much seating at all, probably only enough room  for 12-15 people. I was lucky that when I went on Friday evening, it wasn't busy so I was able to find a spot to eat.  Due to the fact that it wasn't busy, I didn't have to wait very long for my food.   I ordered a small chicken burrito with all of the toppings except for hot peppers. It's under $10 and the burrito was quite filling, so I thought it was pretty good value. It was yummy and I enjoyed my burrito very much. My hubby likes this place because you don't have to pay extra for guacamole.   Overall, I walked away with a positive impression and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"After working out at the YMCA next door, what better way to reward yourself than a Halibut Burrito at Burrito Bandidos.  I mean, I know I am fooling myself into thinking this is a healthy choice because it has fish in it... it is, after all deep fried, and then smothered in toppings that are hard to resist... like the burrito sauce.  I haven't had any of their other burritos in a long time because I love the Halibut burrito THAT much!  It is amazing how heavy the burritos are... but they are also good.    If you used to like Burrito Boyz and find they aren't as good as you remembered, give Burrito Bandidos a try... they got the shaft in the name department after the split, but they win in taste IMHO."}
{"text":"If you like fast mexican food at a good price, this is a great place to fill that urge. The staff is insanely positive and friendly and even the small size was enough to fill me up. They do have a mild spice cooked directly in the meat so those who don't like any spice might pass on it but everyone else should definitely try it out.   The pulled pork burrito is great."}
{"text":"Tiny place. What you would expect for a burito place. Kind staff are welcoming and do theor best to take your order promptly. I was sad to see that the \"steak\" is grounded.  I prefer chincks of it."}
{"text":"The greatest \"open\" secret to this place is this: call ahead for pick up.   Visit this place once and read the menu, intently. Memorize it even. Because the next time you want to drop by and pick up burritto, you'll save ten to fifteen minutes by calling ahead.   No, you can't bring a date here. There are only two or three stools inside the store. And it's too small - gets crowded with five people. This is a pick up place. I mean, \"order and pick up\" place.   I always enjoy the food. I always get the beef steak without spice. I heard that it can really be spicy. Chicken burritto is a perhaps a healthier choice but not that much.   I'm a fan. Of the less healthier choice - beef steak, no spice. Yay!"}
{"text":"This review violates a few basic principles that I set out for myself when I started Yelping. I wasn't going to review chains (unless my review was politically motivated). I wasn't going to chase food trends. I wasn't going to review fast food.  And yet, here I am, excited to the the first reviewer of the latest Burrito Bandidos outlet; not only a chain but the product of a messy divorce from the original 'burrito boyz' further downtown.    This location is quite literally a hole in the wall off Yonge Street, on Gloucester, overshadowed by a shiny new A & W. The walls are red; the floors and fixtures are black. The place is clearly geared towards takeout; dining-in options are limited to the kind of wooden high chairs that grow more treacherous the closer you get to last call, or a stainless-steel counter over which you may practice your Guy Fieri-worthy Burrito Hunch. If it weren't for the modern-rock soundtrack, you might think that you were dining on the TTC.   But nobody comes to Burrito Bandidos for the atmosphere, the service (although it's pleasant), or the scene. It's all about the burrito; a massive two fister stuffed with standard veg, less standard guacamole and your choice of fillings. I suppose that you could order it as a quesadilla and save a buck or two, but you'de be missing the crispy flat-top finished point.   Most of the protein options are on the bland side of tasty. Huge portions of steak and chicken satisfy, but may be toughened from their time in the steam tray. Pulled pork fares better. They sell shrimp, too, but I'm leery of fast-food shrimp after a food-poisoning forced vacation in my past. You may order any of these, but you'd be missing out.   The Halibut Burrito is where it's at; a golden crispy hunk of firm-fleshed fish, ensconced in burrito fixings, wrapped in a tortilla and toasted as above. Think of it as Coronation Street crossed with Lucha Libre, and you'll understand the party that's about to erupt in your mouth.   Does this make me a sell-out?"}
{"text":"Pulled pork burrito! Jesus H, count me in. Ooooo it was delicious! (Went last week)  My friend had a halibut burrito which she gave 2 thumbs up.  The toppings here are tasty, decent guac and tasty sauce. Everything seemed fresh and the place was immaculately tidy.  To be honest, I'm not a hardcore burrito fan so I can't compare it to a zillion other burrito places. (I went with a picky-eater person so burritos are right up her alley). But it was really tasty.   Employees were all really friendly too."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge burrito fan, but I do agree that this place has the best burritos I've found in Toronto so far.   I had the mixed chicken and shrimp large sized, it came to $10 including tax. They have a huge variety of toppings and I just told them to load mine with everything, minus cheese.  Everything is made fresh to order so expect to wait a few minutes.   The tortilla was beautifully toasted and crispy on the outside. Ingredients were all fresh and it was definitely super tasty.   Open late and not too packed in the evening, but I hear it's crazy at lunch!"}
{"text":"Not that great considering all the reviews. I had the small steak and chicken burrito on a whole wheat tortilla with everything except for jalapenos and sour cream.  The meat was DRY! The guac was made out of overripe avocados, which leaves it with that sickly, garbagey taste. There were CHUNKS of tomatoes, not diced tomatoes, chunks. And there was corn in it...where did the corn come from? Portion and price would've been good, if you know it didn't suck.  I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"This place is seriously over hyped. I ordered the large spicy pulled pork burrito and the meat was dry. Nothing really special about the taste. The only positive thing I can say was I paid 9.50 for it and the portion was big. Also they don't charge a dollar for guacamole like at z-teca."}
{"text":"Finding good Tex-Mex or Mexican food in Toronto is as difficult as finding polar bears in Mexico, which is why Burrito Bandidos is a 5* joint by Toronto standard. The burritos are packed with toppings including guac, red/green peppers, tomatoes, corn, and a variety of tasty sauces! The prices are more reasonable than other burrito joints I've been to in the city, and on top of that the servings at this location are bigger too! My small pulled pork burrito was hefty and juicy enough to satisfy both my taste buds and hunger after the gym. The staff are nice and sociable, and the wait times at this location is very tolerable even when it's 'busy'.  No w/c but they provide a hand sanitizer!"}
{"text":"got the pulled pork quesadilla and it was about the same price as fat bastard's (up the street on yonge where i usually go) but much thicker and more filling. i think more vegetables/meat too, all for around the same price. super tasty; would give 4.5 but this site sucks ass"}
{"text":"For the longest time I thought this place was the hidden Burrito Boyz that you never wanted to tell anyone just in case those times when the real BB is busy you come over to this place. Sadly enough even though you don't tell anyone, it's no secret because its just as busy.  Well I just figured out that this isn't even a Burrito Boyz. Why was I confused? well the colours look the same, the menu looks exactly the same, the burritos are cooked the same, and they even taste the same.  So since I thought it was the same as Burrito Boyz I will give my same review, and add the following point; this place is extremely small and crowded, but although there a standing bar rail to eat off of, your best bet is to find a curb side to sit on and eat your meal.  Pros: Best burrito in Toronto in my opinion (along with Burrito Boyz) Good selection of meats (beef, chicken, shrimp, halibut) Biggest burrito serving Take the time to cook it so that the outside gets a little crispy Meat is the main ingredient Their hot sauce is HOT. For medium spice they put on 3 or 4 drops (yes drops)  Cons: Lineups out the door at both lunch and after a hard night of drinking (actually this place may be closed that late) The preparation time is quite long Extremely small standing area The beef can be a little fatty at times"}
{"text":"Great, fast, you can call ahead ir order online! The app is amazing. Weekend night servers are nicer w the clients"}
{"text":"I got a steak bowl and everything tasted  homemade actually. Good but I hate to say it but I'm a chipotle loyalist... ;)!!   I'd give them a shot again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome burrito place that's conveniently located right by Central YMCA. Delicious food in burrito or burrito bowl form (without the tortilla bread). Generous portions for a great price. I had the spicy pulled pork which was amazing, and a friend had mango chicken which she said was a great combination of savoury and sweet."}
{"text":"ok so confirmed that the owners of burrito boyz and banditos were originally partners, but each took one of the downtown core spots and are pursuing their very own bean path into the spicey future. i scarfed down a large beef on whole wheat, identical to the large beef on whole wheat i had on sunday from boyz ... here's the diff: -- boyz offers a slightly more refined hot sauce ... literally i had to push the chicita to put more than the intended 4 dots ... she gave me a funny look but wanted to test this white boy's taste buds out with about 12.  the result: excellent kick and sustained hotness --bandidos (although i was not in a state to count dots) along with my good buddy Dinesh insisted that his mama had given me many hot dishes in the past ... so the full treatment.  the result: immediate hicups :D this was a piercing and immediate hot.  all good.  they subsided and twas no match for my hunger."}
{"text":"Worked here in 2006 when I was 16. Crazy summer job. Food is fresh, clean and delicious. Probably ate 3 burritos/quesadillas a shift and somehow I was in the best shape I've ever been in that summer (correlation or causation, does this mean its healthy??) Bean and cheese is unreal. Great refried beans and rice.  Crunch from the grill and fresh veggies. Delicious sauces. Well marinated and cooked cambrae meats. The mexican rice is so delicious it should be tried separately. Pretty much any combination/proportion of those delicious fresh ingredients is amazing.  I miss it.  Now BBoyz and BBanditos have split the original chain, BBoys got the iconic name and Banditos got the signature creamy, chili, lime sauce."}
{"text":"Burrito Bandidos is great!  Thanks to these guys, there's no need to go South of the Border for good Tex Mex food.   I ordered a large burrito with chicken and shrimp.  Oh, wow, was the shrimp amazingly fresh.  They cook it to order and it tasted oh so good.  It's the best tasting shrimp I've had in my two months of living in T dot.  As for the menu here, it's simple: small burritos, large burritos, & quesadillas.  I didn't see any appetizers listed.  It's great that all of the filings can be had for no additional charge.  I opted to include everything, including each type of sauce.  They do have a house made \"burrito sauce\", but I couldn't discern the actual taste of it because I had them mix in salsa, sour cream, guac, and hot sauce along with it.  Their coconut milk + nectar + pineapple drink was excellent.  I wish more places sold it!  Burrito Bandidos has a few locations in Toronto.  If you come across one, you most definitely need to try it out."}
{"text":"Best burritos in the city!! Reasonable prices as well as a decent size selection, my personal favourite place to get burritos. Call ahead to have burritos ready for pick up as there isn't much space to stay there to eat."}
{"text":"After spending the day at Woodbine Beach, I was looking for a good burrito place within decent walking distance to share with friends. Luckily, Burrito Bandidos was not too far a walk, and it certainly did not disappoint.   I ordered a large Mango Chicken burrito, complete with everything, short of jalapenos. I waited around 5 minutes for the order to be completed, which seemed shorter than most of the reviews here. (Although, most of them seem outdated.) The chicken was fairly juicy and tender, and the ingredients tasted fresh. My only complaint would be that the mango chicken was around a dollar more than the regular chicken, and the only thing you got were roughly julienne-d apple mango slices. Nice, tangy addition, but not worth the extra cost in my opinion.   I would drop by again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. 4/5"}
{"text":"I hardly give out five stars.  Two words: shrimp. burrito.  Try it! I usually get it in a whole wheat wrap sans the guacamole and tomatoes, and daaaaaaaamn, son, it's always an unforgettable experience. The price is extremely fair and makes for a really great casual lunch/dinner. The burritos are quite filling, too. So much better than that burrito place in Kensington.   MMMMmmmmmmmmMMmm. Burritosssss."}
{"text":"Banditos has opened another location. This is both good and bad. It's good because maybe it will force Chino Loco's to up their game as they were really the only burrito place in the area until now. This is bad because Burrito Bandito's food is mediocre.  Because BB's chicken has no flavour and they don't offer a good pork solution, I decided to try the steak and shrimp. I got everything except cilantro and asked for extra hot sauce because I like hot food. The burrito however was not hot. The flavour though was better than previous BB's burritos I've tried and came in at completely average.  As per other BB's locations they over grill the burrito so that the tortilla cracks and makes a mess. Also keeping with tradition, the person making your burrito asks what you want on your burrito but then ignores what you said and makes the burrito as fast as possible without putting any thought behind it. Two of my friends I was with got things on their burritos that they specifically said they didn't want. Now that I think about, it I'm surprised that my burrito was correct. Though I did say three times that I didn't want cilantro on it. I guess you just have to watch them like a hawk and repeat yourself until they get it.  If you like mediocre food this is the place for you to go."}
{"text":"Is Burrito Bandidos serving the BEST burrito in Toronto?? I don't know.. since I am no Burrito expert and I have to base my review on my limited experience.  Unfortunately, my favourite Halibut Burrito ($9.29) only comes in Large... and no one is going to share that with me since I am alone... Yes it is sizable and I was full after eating that!  The fish itself was really tasty, pan fried to golden crisp outside. The only complaint I have was the tortilla itself was toasted so brown, it tasted bitter and burnt.  Music was way way way to loud. Hard for the customers and cashier to communicate. While I was ordering, I felt like I don't understand a word what she was saying or I am just deaf!"}
{"text":"I was craving some burritos, so I finally decided to check out Burrito Bandidos on Bloor ST. I've always been a bit wary of Tex-Mex, because the flavors never really meet my expectations. In regards to flavors, Burrito Bandidos is definitely a step ahead of places like Taco Ball and Taco Time.    I had the small pulled pork burrito with everything on it for $6.15. The burritos are freshly made in front of you, so you might have to wait longer than most fast-food joints. My burrito took about 10-15 minutes, and the restaurant was empty.  Burrito Bandidos is more of a take-out place. This location's eat-in area is a bit cramped, and only accommodates 3-4 people.   The burrito was huge! The hot sauce was one of the hottest I've had in Toronto, and that's a good thing! All the flavors were there, and it tasted fresh. But... There's always a but... There were some minor problems: the pork was dry, and the burrito was way too greasy. I couldn't even finish the whole thing because it was so big! Halfway through, I just gave up.   Burrito Bandidos is still better than Taco Bell and Taco Time, but not by much."}
{"text":"Portion to price ratio is so perfect and the workers there were so nice despite we went there pretty late (10:30). The service was so fast and the place was kept clean. I was so impressed by this place!"}
{"text":"Toronto really lacks a good Mexican/burrito joint for lunch. I went here because it was close to my office and judging from the good Yelp reviews and the stream of people going to this place I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the spiced pulled pork burrito with all the fixins. I was extremely disappointed about the lack of flavour and seasoning of this burrito. There was no spice or heat of the pork, nor in the salsa/sauce. The salsa tasted fresh, but it was merely chopped fresh tomatoes. The result is a mass of rather bland mush in a tortilla.  Going during the lunch hour made for a wait (many of the people there called ahead with their orders), but the staff was very friendly and courteous.  Maybe next time I will try the shrimp or Halibut and ask them to make it spicy and skip the chopped tomatoes.  My favorite burrito place is still Chipotle's Mexican Grill, unforunately their locations are not convenient for me."}
{"text":"Delicious burritos and I normally don't like burritos! I had the small steak burrito but it wasn't small by any means. Quite filling actually. There's barely any sitting room though so it's mostly a take-out spot.  I also got a chicken burrito recently. It was just as good. Can't wait to try out all the different kinds."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm not sure if I get the love for Burrito Bandidos, at least not for the Peter St. location.  I ordered a chicken burrito, after about ~10 minutes of confusion about where to line up and how to pick up my order number... this place is 1/3 the size of the Burrito Boys location on Adelaide and was absolutely crammed to the gills with people when I got in.  Maybe it's because I didn't pick the right protein for the burrito, but... the chicken was overcooked, blandly seasoned and somewhat organy; basically, the taste reminded me of a mediocre chicken shawarma pita.  The underside of the whole wheat tortilla that housed the burrito was grilled to to the point of charring and felt rather dry, which I did not enjoy.  The guacamole wasn't anything to write home about, either--and as a lover of avocado who never orders her burritos sans guacamole, this makes me sad.  I'm really not sure that I'd be back again..."}
{"text":"Virtually concealed down a hugger-mugger staircase on Peter street is a bantam burrito booth barely bigger than a beefalo: Burrito Bandidos. Burrito- and quesadilla-slinging is their game, and they do it well. You can get a bean-missile in a myriad of ways, includings combos of shrimp/chicken, chicken/steak, etc. They are available in both large and small, and figure in the $6-8 range.  No one seems to be able to shut up about the halibut, but I was able to ignore the fishy pleas and ordered a simple steak burrito on a whole wheat tortilla; my burrito buddy ordered the pulled pork. The burritos take a while, but it's worth it. They are grilled perfectly, not too full or gooey. It's clear they know how to wrap a 'rito here; I didn't lose a single morsel to the floor or my lap. I don't know how big a \"large\" is, but the small is a respectable size if you're just trying to silence your appetite without smothering it.  I had a fair shake at both of those toothsome torpedos, and I have to say I enjoyed the steak more. The pulled pork was certainly delicious and tender, but the sweet flavours didn't mesh with the tex-mex like I hoped they would. The steak was much better, though strangely it didn't turn out as spicy as I would have hoped.  Not major complaints at all. If you have to choose between the double BBs, this one is the winner.  Obligatory Title Pun: I'm with the BAND-idos.  Menu Readability: Funky hip-hop-esque printing on a chalkboard.  Need to mention: They gots Jumex.  What this place teaches me about myself: Are burritos the fifth pillar of hip-hop?"}
{"text":"I tend to frequent Burrito Bandidos at least once a week, especially if it's a busy work day and I can only afford to leave the office for five minutes. Despite always being packed (or always seeming packed because of its tiny, cramped interior?), they do a pretty good job of getting you in and out quickly.   Order, get your number, pay, wait awkwardly close to six other people for your number to be called, collect your delicious burrito. Consume. Repeat.   Standard prices, fresh ingredients, REALLY spicy hot sauce.   It's everything you really need in a burrito joint. Left off once star for lack of indoor dining space. It's just not that kinda place, though!"}
{"text":"I've been jaded by not-so-great suggestions by Muggles regarding good burrito joints in the area. Are there any good burrito places around here? Burrito Bandidos did not disappoint.  This place is a little hard to find, since you have to descend some stairs into Diagon Alley. Once you enter, it's pretty cramped. It's especially bad if it's busy because they continue to take orders while people come in. There's little room to wait for those who have already ordered and paid. This place could use Perkins' tent. There are newspaper clippings on the walls from the Onion to pass the time. Strange that the people don't move in the photos. When I finally received my order about 10 minutes afterwards, it felt like I had caught the golden snitch.  I ordered the small chicken burrito, which is sufficiently filling for lunch. I didn't want it spicy, so no spicy sauce and no jalapenos. But guess what? The green peppers have quite a bit of kick to them. I had to accio some water to cool it down. The chicken was very tasty. It must have been the sauce that was used to marinate it. The tortilla was nice and toasted. There wasn't an excess of liquid inside the burrito. And you don't have to pay extra for the guacamole! All the essentials that I look for in a burrito.  It was definitely worth the wait. 4 points for Gryffind... I mean, Burrito Bandidos."}
{"text":"no words to describe customer service!!!! If you want to experience stuck up employees who think their high end chefs this is the place to go!! I definitely do not recommend this spot due to lack of customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Pales in comparison to the much better Chino Locos down the street. Service is fine but the actual food is bland and somewhat burnt, not a huge fan."}
{"text":"One of the worst things about fast food is seeing it made. For the longest time I had a friend bring the fish or shrimp Burritos home for a quick dinner. They were always great & yummy. But once while out for a walk we stopped in and ordered the same. Not pleasant to see everything plopped on by someone who really doesn't care you will be eating it. The food is still good, generous portions, although always have to say \"dairy free\". But never again do I want to see them made. Look away and enjoy in ignorance.  Updated April 7, 2012: The place is located just north of Bloor on Walmer and is a tiny little take away place on the corner. It features a window that looks out east onto Walmer with a ledge that runs along the window and along one wall allowing for a few bar stools as seating. Outside they have a single pick nick table for those who want to eat al fresco. You choose your tortilla wrap, white or whole wheat and then are given a choice of toppings. Everything is prepared in a production styled manner and ladled on top of the tortilla and given to the servers in the back who add the cooked ingredients from a grill behind the server.   One of the saddest things about such food preparation is watching how it is made. Especially when those preparing the food take no pleasure in the production treating like a welding job at Ford. Food is something to be enjoyed and watching someone ladle on the ingredients with little thought or care makes the food seem less appetizing. Even though watching them being made can be depressing, the food itself is always good, for the price paid. They are not over-packed and the ingredients are fresh our only quibble with the flavour was a really strong hot sauce that overpowered everything else. For a simple dinner on a beautiful sunny day it was a nice meal."}
{"text":"don't be expected to be greeted with a warm smile or please and thankyou the music is extremely LOUD cramped seating   i had the spicy pork burrito  it was dry and stringy  but the burrito was hot  and the rest of the ingredients were tasty."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off saying that I realize there's little in terms of authenticity to this place. I, for one, don't care - I still love it.  The Great Burrito Bifurcation of Let's Call It 2009 let the area with two chains where once there was one. Of the two, I'd have to say Burrito Bandidos beats out the Boyz. Why, you ask? The location certainly isn't it - cramped at the best of times during the day, it's downright insane at night. The expanded selection of meats certainly helps - sometimes you just want some pulled pork or a chicken-steak blend. But overall I do find that the Bandidos are a notch above the Boyz on Adelaide in terms of overall taste.  I find service to usually be friendly, but slow. Call ahead for group orders or later at night - saves time, especially on clubbing' nights.  Price-wise, you're looking at 8 to 10 per person, more depending on size and meat selection."}
{"text":"Their burritos are insanely large.  For $11, I suppose they should be.  Very flavorful for late night fast food, although I would be happy if I could order something half the size."}
{"text":"I love this place. Open until 4am, it's the perfect little \"around the corner and down the stairs\" place for awesome food at a great price with friendly staff. Totally worth it! Only a few steps from the Hilton on Peter street."}
{"text":"This is really more of a 3,5 stars but since the staff is so nice I thought I would bump it up a bit.   I feel like a traitor because the cashier is such a peach but the burritos have one fatal problem: they are too mushy.   All of the ingredients are delicious except there is an overkill of refried beans. Also FOUR kinds of mushy things are included on the burrito: salsa, sour crean, burrito sauce, and guacamole. This isn't even including the beans. It makes for one mushy burrito.  The first time I ordered the chicken, it was okay. This time I ordered the pulled pork which was delicious - spicy and smokey flavored. I asked for light sauce but I observed an insane amount of beans being put in. The proportions just aren't right.   Still the place is good, they are friendly and I think customers just have to be vocal about the amounts of things they want. Also be careful because sometimes the grill man overgrills the burrito.   Next time I go I plan on asking for light on the beans, no sour cream and seeing what happens."}
{"text":"I know I am tough on burrito places in Toronto. I don't think I can give any burrito place a five star review but I was pretty satisfied with my veggie burrito tonight.  As a vegetarian, I get really sick of being served peppers, onions, and more peppers and onions. I don't even like peppers. So it is a big treat to be able to be served soya meat in a whole wheat tortilla with all the burrito essentials. Big, big ups.  The toppings are OK, nothing amazing. They have shredded cheese, average lettuce (which I wasn't crazy about), guacamole (which I was totally into), and brown rice, sauces, and chilies.  This isn't my first time here but with Big Fat Burrito moving into Lee's Palace on Bloor, I am not sure if it is going to be my last or not. Living between two Big Fat Burritos and Burrito Banditos makes the decision challenging.  What I do enjoy is their selection of ridiculous articles on the wall. The place is cramped so it is hard to squeeze in and read them, but it adds some charm and quirkiness to the atmosphere, which is roughly all the space can handle - this place is tiny! It's probably best to get your burrito to go."}
{"text":"Burrito Bandidos, eh... I remember when this particular location was called \"Burrito Boys\" - and even then it was blatantly famous around the neighbourhood offices.  For a good reason. Even though a burrito doesn't look like a big deal to prepare, some people just do that wrong! But not the Burrito Bandidos... or boys... whatever.  Probably the second most important thing after the clean and fresh ingredients is a sheer size of the portion. Get a big one, eat it, and your belly will be happy for a bunch of hours to go.  The only significant drawback is a popularity of this place - it gets super-crowded during the lunch time, so just give yourself some margin, otherwise you will be doomed to wait for something that feels like ages - especially when you are hungry."}
