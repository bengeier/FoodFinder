{"text":"When Pita was at their original location in Mesa it was my first and last visit there. I walked in with my friend, not knowing what to expect and we were the only customers but greeted warmly. I was impressed with their food especially the hummus, the rice and their tender meats. I did grab a business card knowing I would go back for sure then found out they closed. I am excited to know of the new location in Tempe. The food is amazing and employees are very friendly. Also the atmosphere/decors makes you feel like you're not in Arizona, as if we are taken away in a time capsule. Love it!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious! The pita bread was so fresh! The service was excellent as well. The authenticity was amazing!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience here. The lamb shank platter was very good as was the beef shawarma wrap. The owner and the waiter were also extremely nice and polite. Give this a place a chance!"}
{"text":"Everything is so yummy. Best hummus in town!
The amount of food and quality is great. All freshly prepared."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!  The owner Sam is TOP NOTCH! The food is great and the delivery is just as fast as Jimmy Johns... Freakishly fast.  Try the  shawrama combo.. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"AVENGERS APPROVED!

I finally had a chance to try Pita Licious. Here's all anyone needs to know: It's good, inexpensive, authentic, something different from the typical fast food, you can eat in or take out, they also deliver. For what it is, it's well worth having Pita Licious for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent place ... I am coming from New York, so I have eaten at many Middle Eastern places before .... But this one was a stand out .... The place has a good interior ... Staffs are really friendly .. Food is tasty .... And if you are going, do not miss on the desserts .... This place has absolutely the best Baklawas ... Loved it !"}
{"text":"My friends and I were so sad to hear that Pita Licious was closing in Mesa. But now there's a new location in Tempe right near the 60 freeway and Rural Road. The same ownership and same wonderful fresh food. Please be aware that the name for now says \"Sheba\". Highly recommended for anyone with tastebuds. Best Lebanese place in town!"}
{"text":"I'm a very discerning critic when it comes to Middle Eastern food. I must say that Pita Licious delivers a wonderful and unique meal. It is a hidden gem in Mesa. The decor is lovely and the owners are kind and friendly. But the fresh food is what keeps me coming back for more. Very reasonable prices. I'm now a regular and I highly recommend this restaurant. Ten stars!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place that has very tasty falafel!! I got the falafel wrap and my mother got the two sandwich deal with chicken. They unfortunately dont have an ice machine but that does not take away from the tasty food!
Also the staff that was present were very friendly and attentive to any needs we might have!"}
{"text":"Pita Licious Is a great place to eat when you are in the mood for real good home made Mediterranean food. The place has very nice decors, with very friendly staff and has one amazing Gyro for a price that won't break your wallet. I would recommend a quick pit stop to Pita Licious to have your taste buds go wild. Great food Great people... I would recommend anyone to go try gyros at Pita Licious."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of this strip mall next to the AMF Tempe Village Lanes, Pita Licious is just waiting to be discovered. Don't be mislead by the name, this is a Mediterranean restaurant. They have much more than just pitas and wraps. I walked in for a gyro and was shocked by the variety of food options. The gyro I had was piled high with meat and brought to my table quickly. They serve two types of baklava here. The traditional type and one that's made with pistachios. I couldn't resist either and ended up sampling them both. Amazing pastries. I'm looking forward to my next visit when I can explore their menu further."}
{"text":"Delicious food made with love. Tried the shawarma and falafel pita both were yummy!! Actually this place deserves more attention for what it dose, authentic Arabic food, one of the best in Tempe."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Really friendly owner and wife(cook). Asked for a suggestion and ordered the lunch special(pic posted). The wife also came to check on me and asked how everything was. The food tasted fresh and really homemade. Loved the dessert, Knafeh. Hope to return to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by because it's new in our neighborhood and we love Mediterranean cuisine. I always get the traditional Gyros pita and my husband got the Gyro plate with rice. The food looked like it was just microwaved definitely not fresh and very dry--down to the tomatoes on my pita. I am missing the $30 we spent there. The positive is that the owner was really nice. If he could just serve fresh food made when you order, I believe it would make a difference. Unfortunately, we will not revisit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and they literally only had Gyros.  Nothing else.  They tasted good, but I was in the mood for kebob and rice."}
{"text":"Excellent quality and flavor in all the foods for the special Eid buffet. 
All homemade like you would get at someone's home for a holiday or wedding. Everything I tried was excellent(and I tried almost everything!) and everyone in our family of 6 enjoyed it, as did the friends that we came with. 
The atmosphere is clean and humble but the food is outstanding. We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Small cosy casual restaurant with great middle eastern food...the oener is very friendly and always makes an effort to greet his customers.  Their Baba is some of the best I've ever tasted. Also have special section for large groups snd small parties. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The food was so bad and taste horrible when you leave you smell like grease its over priced i went to that place twice and found hair in my last meal \"gyro\" i will never get back agin"}
{"text":"The last couple times there were disappointing. The teenage staff barely put their phones down long enough to acknowledge me.. The order was correct, but the meat was tough.. Meh..  Then there's the issue with GrubHub.. Drama. Best of luck. But I am done."}
{"text":"After a long day at work, i went to pita licious to get some good Mediterranean food. And i totally made the right choice. I grew up eating Mediterranean food so I believe I can differentiate between good or bad Mediterranean food. The server was quite friendly and helpful, he recommended a sea food dish called Rosa filet. It was basically boneless fish cooked with veggies and sauce on a bed or yellow rice. The fish tasted very good, and the rice was well made! The place itself was decorated with paintings on the wall with various pictures from that region. The prices were acceptable considering that theres not many restaurants serve such food around here. Overall experience was very good. It became my dependable restaurant for when i want Mediterranean"}
{"text":"I went to the Rural/US 60 location and ordered the garlic dip for an appetizer, which consisted of a container full of white mush with a little bit of oil drizzled on it. It barely had a hint of garlic to it and the mush was inedible. They only provided 4 tiny pita quarters to attempt to eat all that. I also ordered the gyro. The flavor of the gyro was decent, but nothing special. Unfortunately the gyro only had four slim strips of meat on it.
 I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Local place in the neighborhood, & we decided to give it a try. The gentleman who helped us was very friendly & helpful. We decided to try the mixed grill, so that we could try a couple of things. We were not disappointed, as it was SO good. Food tasted like great homemade!"}
{"text":"There were flies everywhere. I understand that's a hard thing to deal with, but it was a big nuisance/problem. 

They didn't have about 1/4 of the things that we asked for (things on the menu/daily specials, etc.).

The food was okay. They didn't bring what I ordered, but it was okay. The hummus was the worst I've had a pita place and the pitas weren't warm/good, but the chicken was good. The Coke was flat and I couldn't even drink it (I haven't had one in weeks, so I was really looking forward to it, but it was that bad that I left it). 

Oh and my husband and I both got sick. I don't think there's any way to pin down exactly what caused it (w/ all the food recalls from everywhere), but we think it was there. 

Will not return for any reason!"}
{"text":"Tasty delicious Mediterranean food. Nice variety of plates and sandwiches, their portions are unbelievable! Sandwiches are packed (see photo!) and plates are really big. Staff are very welcoming and friendly. And I was surprised to know they also cater, just talk to the owner. 

Been there several times during lunch and never disappointed. Sometimes they run out of an item or two but there is always plenty of items to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food, good price the service was amazing I def recommend it's also vegan friendly"}
{"text":"2nd time eating here.  The gyro is blah.  It's on the smaller side and has pickle which is a nice touch, but it's nothing special.  However, the price is good.  The hummus is just...bland.  There's no spice or even flavor really.  And the pita for dipping was rubbery and did not taste fresh.  I actually threw more than half of it way.  If you're looking for Greek in the area, go the extra couple block for Opa Life."}
{"text":"I'd never been to this restaurant and needed a quick lunch bite. The interior is very spacious and clean with mostly booth seating. I ordered a gyro sandwich with fries and had a 20% yelp coupon, which came up to less than $7. The food was good and a good portion it was a traditional gyro, instead of the Tziki sauce I got a side of hummus which was good as well. Great deal! Customer service was great, especially Tareq who showed me their new menu coming up in the next few weeks. The food came out exactly like I was hoping!"}
{"text":"Great food, I highly recommend the shawarma. I have been here a few times, and just love the place. 

Don't miss it when they have the open buffet."}
{"text":"This place is not worth the visit.  The place smells bad.  They have their kids running around and serving tables.  They have no fountain soda or water.  You have to purchase cans of soda or bottles of arrowhead water and they charge you normal beverage prices.  They had no cook on staff and the adult had to ask the child what went on the plate.  They charged me 13.99 for a chicken and beef kabob.  The chicken was maybe 3 ounces cut up into chunks and placed on a few shreds of lettuce (I'm assuming this was what they called their salad) The beef kabob looked like a combination of meatloaf and a turd.  The side of fries I received were burnt so crisp you couldn't bite into them and they don't offer ketchup.  Overall it was just sad."}
{"text":"This place is a gem we stumbled on, amazing food, great dessert, great service, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Be sure to check out this awesome mom-and-pop restaurant. The service is incredible and you can tell they appreciate your business. The food is fresh and authentic. The prices were very reasonable for what I received. I will definitely return, especially because of the very friendly and sweet young lady who works the counter."}
{"text":"Great food and ok price. 
Food was fresh and customer service was really great. I hope prices was a little lower so it could be a choice number one among other middle eastern restaurants, but I'm satisfied with the portion of food. I recommend to try this place."}
{"text":"Very kind, warm owner. Delicious authentic food."}
{"text":"Worthless place!
First off, have been here a few times, and live down the street and have never seen another soul inside besides one worker. Always thought that was weird.
The place is only randomly open (not the posted hours) I've showed up several times to it being closed, and one time to the guy who works there smoking outside in the middle of the day, and he's like \"we're closed\" asked when they'd be open and he's like \"uhh maybe Monday or Tuesday?\" lol wtf? This was on a Wednesday.
Also inconsistent service when it comes to the food, sometimes was great, sometimes was blah, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller portion or this item included one time but not the next (not to mention bad customer service when it comes to the attitude!)
I won't bother this place with my money ever again now. The guy working there genuinely seemed bothered by my presence each visit, like it was a huge burden for him to get up and serve a customer or even attempt to think or speak English. 
Plenty of better places to go than this dump."}
{"text":"Pitalicious has just reopened on Friday. I have not tried their food prior to this day so not sure why there were reviews with pretty low star ratings in the past. Based on our experience today, the Iftar buffet was great! It reminded me of Dubai iftars, with all the appetizers, main dishes, Roasted whole lamb, dessert, tea and drinks! This is an open buffet so you can eat as much as you want, all for $10.99! Great price. 

The food was delicious! Very similar to home-cooked food! Everything is made fresh everyday. They don't run out of food so even when the trays finish, they bring out more. The owner and chefs are very nice and very humble. 

I would definitely recommend coming here for Iftar during the month of Ramadan, but come early because just 3 min after Iftar time, there was only one table left, which we took luckily took! 

I will be coming here again during Ramadan to try more delicious food on their buffet menu which changes everyday. I would be interested to see what food they offer outside of Ramadan and what their A la Carte menu is priced at. Great find during this month! We got lucky! :) 

**for people who don't know what Iftar is or Iftar time is, it's dinner during the holy month of Ramadan, which starts at around 7:30pm**"}
{"text":"I tried all the food there ,, and i can say its one of the best middle Eastern restaurant. I really recommend the fish here, it is so incredible,, and the service is so nice."}
{"text":"I went to this place at night. The server was nice and friendly. The food was Ok. It was a grilled fish and taste was good but It was pre-grilled and I think they just warmed it up. It was also a little over priced. People there were really nice but the food itself was average. I may try this place again later."}
{"text":"Came here on an online deal. The restaurant is small like 8 booths maybe. It was real quiet when I came in. (No customers) My food was delicious! I got the baba ganoush, stuffed grape leaves, and a gyro. My food was awesome! The Grape leaves were really one of the best I had. The price was a little much but like I said I came in with an online coupon. I would probably come back if someone else was buying!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the service is warm and friendly. We were a party of 13 that walked in without reservations near the end of the work day. The staff was very polite and the food was fresh and promptly prepared. I highly recommend this Restaurant to all who love great food!"}
{"text":"Food and service are both spectacular. The place is comfortable as well. I've been there twice, but looking forward to future visits."}
{"text":"My go-to for quick, inexpensive, healthy, and crazy delicious Mediterranean. The owner is almost always on site, and is above and beyond in customer service. Always takes care of us every time we visit, no fail. Atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming.

The hummus.. oh lawdy, the hummus! Definitely shows this man takes pride in his creations! Unique flavor with just enough garlic. I often get the falafel pita, which is made with the same love. And very affordable too"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma was so good I was licking the paper it came on. Very high quality for an extremely reasonable price. This restaurant is quiet for now, but I have a feeling it's going to get huge."}
{"text":"I came in last night for take out. The place is big. The person at the front was nice. I ordered a gyro plateas recommended, with pita bread, hummus and rice. 

It was really good. The only complaint I had is that the pita bread was hard and not as soft as other places. I'm not sure if it was because I had takeout. Maybe next time I'll eat there and see if the pita bread is like that or not and update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Ordered from Pita Licious tonight for the first time.  Live in a neighborhood very close by but have been a George's fan since we moved to Tempe four years ago.  Tonight we decided to try something new instead of driving the 15 minutes each way.  We were very disappointed with our dinner.  The portion size is small, without a salad included, compared to what we are used to.  The gyro was average at best and the previous review that cited the tzatziki sauce being watered down was spot on.  I felt it lacked any taste as well.  My wife picked up the order and said that the interior was old and run down.  So is George's to be fair."}
{"text":"Beef Shawarma wrap was the best I've ever had. The gyro was alright. Had an issue with the online ordering system, but the owner was very helpful in resolving the issue. Friendly staff, and a very nice owner. Will definitely be coming back for the beef shawarma!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks ago and ordered the Gyro and Mix Grill to-go. They were out of Gyros (?!) so ordered the Chicken Shawarma instead.  Food was good, nice portions.  Mix Grill came with lots of rice and a side of hummus. Service was friendly.

On the negative side, I was by myself (no cell phone or other entertainment) waiting for the food and was able to really check the place out.  It was a mess!  There were lotion and soap bottles scattered all over an empty display case. The paint, flooring, chairs, and booths had all seen better days... long long ago.  The sauces at the tables were crusty and old looking. 

I would have to classify it as a hole-in-the-wall... which is fine... Except for the pictures that are posted are not of the same place!  There is no buffet, nor would there be room for a buffet. It's just odd that a place that moved to a new location would open this way, I've never seen a \"new\" place with old chairs, tables, etc. 

I love this type of food, and will come back when it's expanded and renovated."}
{"text":"Excellent food, efficient service, confusing name situation.

First off, I'm a little confused by what this place is actually called. I'm putting my review under this name because the advertisements around the place used this name, but the name \"Sheba\" was up on the front of the building. So it might be helpful to make it clearer what actually exists at the location on Rural Rd just south of the 60. Whatever it's called, it's delicious!

I came here for lunch and went in, despite the fact that there was only one other guy in the place. On a positive note, I got very quick service as a result. The service was very quick and efficient. Whether this was solely as a result of the small amount of people in the restaurant, I don't know, but it was quick and efficient.

I had the chicken shawarma and hummus plate. It was a large amount of chicken shawarma in a bed of hummus with a side of pita bread. The chicken was nice and tender with good seasoning, and the hummus was quite tasty.

I'll be back to try some other options. The food I did try was excellent. Hopefully I can figure out what to actually call this place in the future."}
{"text":"What a good hidden spot! I bought the chicken sovlaki pita and it was so good, diced into small pieces with tomato & lettuce. My mother loved the tea and I loved the hummus & garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! I am a huge foodie and especially picky about Mediterranean food. Very authentic, flavorful and accommodating place. Great owners .."}
{"text":"server was nice and helpful, place is in need of a make over. The food was average, chick was a bit dry and the rice was bland. The hummus and pits were good. Bottled beverages only, and they needed to serve a side sauce with the meat to make it more flavorful."}
{"text":"I ordered the  Chicken Shawarma Wrap $5.50. It tasted great and was a good portion. I added fries and a drink for $3 and it came with a large potion of fries. The staff was friendly and courteous. Restaurant is clean. If you want to support a family owned business this is the place."}
{"text":"An aptly named portmanteau! Pitalicious has good food for reasonable prices. The menu has all your Mediterranean/Middle Eastern style favorites such as falafel, gyro, shawarma, and hummus. The interior is a bit faded but they have nice tables and chairs for you to sit enjoy your meal. 

We got a gyro pita, chicken shawarma with baba ghanoush, and grape leaves to go. Unfortunately when we arrived they were sold out of the hummus, falafel, and kanafeh dessert. The chicken plate was actually supposed to be made with hummus but since they were out I substititued baba ghanoush instead.

The chicken was perfectly seasoned and tasted good with the tangy baba ghanoush. The pita bread it was served with was pillowy soft. I would have liked some more pita to go with the meal though as I ran out of pita halfway through eating. The grape leaves are made fresh in-house and come 6 to an order. I didn't try any gyro but my husband said it was a pretty basic gyro.

Service was very friendly and welcoming. 

I'll have to come here again so I can try their hummus and kanafeh. Until next time Pitalicious!"}
{"text":"Pita Licious is absolutely delicious. Mohammad was very kind and accommodating. Best Mediterranean food around! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu and it is super affordable!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place.  Am a regular customer.  Owner is very welcoming and the food is great.  MedGreek Salad is delicious one of the best greek salads I've had in years, and I always try every restaurants greek salad.  Falafal pita is also very cheap but very good.  I love the hummus, everything is so homemade.  Defiantly give them a try."}
{"text":"OMG best beef shawrma I have ever ate !! and their french fries is soo good. they recommended me to try the chicken shawma too. i will be back very soon to try it. THANK YOU SO MUCH"}
{"text":"Found this place in the corner of a pretty bland shopping plaza near our local grocery store and figured I would try it out since I was in the mood for a Mediterranean even though the reviews weren't that great.

The place is small and not much to look at, but the server was very nice and inviting. I ordered the Chicken Shwarma Wrap, the Hummus and Shwarma, and Baklava for take out.  After getting in the car and sneaking a bite of the Baklava I knew I was in for a treat. If the rest of the meal was any indication this place is a keeper. 

My wife and I split the main dishes and we were both very satisfied with the food. The wrap was tasty defiantly freshly made. The hummus was smooth and had great flavor and you already know how I feel about that. 

The place seems is as far from corporate as you can get and for this place it works. If you can find the place and don't judge it off the decor the FOOD makes this place a winner. Can't wait to try out more of the menu."}
{"text":"I'm very open to \"hole in the wall\" restaurants. This was a no go. Decor bad, food ok, service fine. I would be scared to see what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"I love their food here! I'm a big gyro fan and their gyro is fantastic. I've gotten rice before here and it has an interesting spice that makes it have a little kick and I love that. Also their lunch combo for gyro is very affordable. Very nice service."}
{"text":"I visited there and must say I truly enjoyed the food. It was freshly cooked and delicious! The owners are very friendly and they do the cooking! If you want a 'home cooked' meal, then make sure to come here.. I eat at many places and am very picky with food, especially their health grades on Maricopa restaurant website, and they pass my requirements.. I now have a new place and you should too!!"}
{"text":"Excellent wrap!  Great food. Beautiful decor. Very nice couple own and operate the restaurant."}
{"text":"I got the Greek salad, which was decent but their Mixed Kebab plate wasn't amazing as the reviews had said it would be.  Nice clean place though."}
{"text":"Excellent food. And I mean excellent!

Wow and the prices they charge are amazing. Huge portions. Very healthy and tasty food. What an incredible value.

Just don't come here if you're in a hurry. Service is slow and well,... it's worth it though"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. As a vegan I wasn't sure if they would be able to accommodate my needs, but decided to try this place out. They went above and beyond making sure everything was exceptional."}
{"text":"A very cozy Middle Eastern restaurant with a specialty menu. It's a fairly small menu that they master with  very special in house made sauces that are out of the world. Portions are good and the staff is very warm and welcoming. You can just tell when someone is striving to give a 5 star service and this place is one of them. Kudos to them, you'll be seeing a lot of me and my family!"}
{"text":"Wish my food looked like these pictures they post. I'm assuming someone had a bad day and took it out on my order. I ordered garlic sauce and got garlic flavored mayonnaise with oil drizzled on top. A full salad with a tablespoon of dressing in a cup. Not happy I was starving and couldn't eat half of it. Mediterranean food is supposed to be healthy and delicious. Very sad and still hungry. First and last time with this place."}
{"text":"I paid several dollars for the smallest, most absolute mediocre chicken shawarma ever. People were friendly, but, based on the food they serve, they clearly don't respect their customers. Go around the corner to Big Boys Pizza on Baseline, Cornish Pasty, or Pita Jungle by MCC instead. No reason to go here when there is so much better around."}
