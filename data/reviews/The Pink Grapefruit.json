{"text":"Just east of Church St., along the north side of Queen rests this cute little health-kick. Perfect for lunch, or some never-tried-that kind-before coffee.  If you're looking for an off the beaten path escape from the hustle of downtown, then this foodie layer might be the perfect remedy. I'd get more into the detail of the food itself, but the recipes are homemade, and tend to vary from week to week. However, judging from the Cold Soba salad I tried, this place is a gateway to a world of tasty wonders. There are also great ready-made choices for those who need a quick grab, and who can't afford any more time than the walk."}
{"text":"I just had the best salad ever at Pink Grapefruit. Chickpea with mint and tomato. This place is so cute and the food is AWESOME! We really needed a place near campus where you can get a great healthy lunch and its not crazy expensive considering that everything is fresh and home made. I paid about 6.00$ for a salad and a pastry treat. I can't wait to try their oatmeal next."}
{"text":"It's okay....it's near George Brown where I go to school and I am trying to eat healthier so I eat here occasionally.  I really have to stop though because it's mega expensive...maybe I should be less snobby about food that tastes like it was made by me, lol."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this cute little spot in an area that could use more little coffee shops and healthy food options but it did not deliver. While the food I had was not awful (the quinoa salad had nice flavour though the dip I bought was only so so), there were other issues such as not delivering what a coffee shop / cafe should deliver in the downtown core, especially as it will attract a clientele that is green-minded, health conscious and in some cases (students), not able to dish out lots of money.

I went in and wasn't sure if I was going to order and the only reason I did is that there was nothing else comparable open nearby. My first issue was that they don't have plates or cups to be green for those who are staying. So my salad and other items - including glass of water, were in disposable plastic containers. I should have said no and went again my better judgment. I wanted to get an item that would require being heated up but they only had plastic containers to do so... even if it states on the container that it is microwaveable, does not make it safe, so that was a deal breaker for me.

The way the person who worked there handled a homeless person who came in (granted they were pan handling so I know it had to be handled) left something to be desired and when I asked for change (to leave a tip), I was told no because they had no change. 

Without wifi or tunes that give you a cafe vibe, this just has the purchase and go home feel that is not very competitive downtown. 

Since the food was not bad, and the prices, while not great (not for a student's budget) were not atrocious, if everything else aligns, then you're building great business. But it takes more than decent food to build a reputation."}
{"text":"Looks cute and healthy, but food is not worth price and really not great.

First of all they advertise a \"early bird special\" that encourages people to buy lunch with breakfast but when I asked for a panini around 11am, the woman working laughed and said it was \"a little early for the lunch menu\". Lol. The hot chocolate taste like really cheap mix also. I ordered a sandwich that was already made and tasted okay .. Served cold on the inside and pretty bland."}
{"text":"Amazing teas! I highly recommend the coconut cream chai or the toasty almond (my coworkers and I are obsessed with it). The place is super clean, the staff are extremely polite and friendly! I come here almost everyday :) also, the pastries are so delicious... The brownies just melt in your mouth and the grapefruit bars... I can't even begin to put into words how amazing they are."}
{"text":"Those of us office dwellers on the eastern out skirts of the core (proper) are typically drawn west to the centre of the city by an imperceivable force.  The dense pack of towers and the lunch choices it offers is a black hole of convenience that requires little thought.  After a hectic morning, I don't really want to make many decisions so I allow myself to be drawn, along with the rest of the sheep, to mass produced (but still totally delicious and healthy) food outlets.

So here's the thing, I bike to work and on my way I often ride by this cute little shop on Queen East by Jarvis.  Might seem a bit far out, but not really if you consider my office is near Yonge/Adelaide and I seem to have no issue walking down to IQ at Bay/Wellington.  Do the math, it's basically the same.

I convinced my co-workers to indulge in difference today.  We walked east.  We didn't have to dodge all the smartphone zombies but there was one lady that we having a heated argument with a figment of her imagination.

Pink Grapefruit is totally worth it... 'it' being the risk of trying something off the beaten track.  Serving Intelligentsia coffee, prepared meals, pressed sandwiches, soups, pantry items and more, it's a sweet little joint. The salads and sandwiches are fresh (though not made fresh right then and there), with attention holding elements.  My Yorkville Summer salad for instance had moist chicken breast, goat cheese, berries, edamame, sunflower and pumpkin seeds.  It was really tasty and only $8.95. I'm all for keeping lunch under the $10 mark. All the coworkers enjoyed their selections too, sandwiches and salads.  We'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars but I am rounding up to off-set Alice T.'s review. I was surprised to see this had such a low rating on yelp, but then realized there are only 2 reviews. I am puzzled that Alice T's review was included (despite the fact she only has 1 review) whereas reviews that sound pretty \"real\" from Yelpers were over 25 reviews were excluded... Anyways, I read Alice's review and felt some of the points were valid (no in-house plates) but I think a 1 star is harsh. Whether or not you agree with a grab & go model is not an assessment of a place's food. Anyways, the owner responded in a totally professional way on Yelp which is good. 

So yes, this is a welcome addition to the area, which does not have a whole lot of great, fast lunch options that are healthy. I have tried some of their salads and find them to be fresh and flavourful, although I could make something very similar at home, it is the convenience you are paying for. It's cute that some of the salads are named after various Toronto neighbourhoods. I think my favourite is the Kensington Mexican salad with lots of avocado and corn. Yum! They also have some hot entrees like grilled chicken, salmon, etc. with veggie sides. It could work well for grabbing dinner on the way home, or a heartier lunch. They also carry a small selection of grocery type items (e.g. De Cecco pastas, boxes of tea). It's not cheap, but prices are reasonable. I also like that there are small snack sized salads along with bigger ones. I've never tried their breakfast sandwiches but they sound delicious!

When I've been, the service is always welcoming and friendly. I even saw the chef today singing some Motown as he moved between the back kitchen and the front area -- nice to see people who enjoy what they are doing:) 

Seating is limited, although I walk by frequently on weekdays and it's never packed. So you should be able to sit there if you choose. As mentioned, it is more of a grab & go place, which is fine by me. I usually pick something up and bring it back to my office, where co-workers enviously ask where I got my lunch!"}
