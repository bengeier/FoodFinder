{"text":"If you are looking for the BEST selection of imported chocolate, or trying to recreate authentic German recipes, or try out some new beer, wine or Haribo gummy bears, then you need to check this place out!

My husband and I love Hansa because Boris and Suzy (the owners) are so helpful and involved. Suzy is always importing new and exciting things for the store, and is happy to give recommendations on anything from beer to chocolate. If you're looking for Glüwein, they also have it here -- the perfect German spiced wine, best served hot!

The store also sells imported lotions, teas, jam, magazines, and has a small selection of cheeses, deli meat, bread and even herring. It's one of those stores where you can walk in and discover something new each and every time"}
{"text":"Ohhh, Hansa Import Haus. Ich bete dich an. Du bist schön.

I lived in Dresden, Germany once upon a time, and shopping here made me so happy. It felt so good to be in a German grocery store and brought me a sense of joy I can't explain. You could get lost in here wandering for a long time and the atmosphere is so welcoming. First off, I feel r-i-d-i-c-u-l-o-u-s for not knowing this was here. Latched on to the Hansa Brewery, the Hansa Import Haus is a sprawling specialty grocery store of German and Austrian goods. Legit, I only knew it was here because I walked by and saw their new window display (which I am so glad they did!).

You can get anything here. Meats, cheeses, noodles, sauces, chocolate, cookies... heck, you can even get boxed mixes. I had such unbelievable fun walking the aisles. Literally. Anything you can think of within reason. Amazing beer and wine selection. They even have little German coloring books, and this week, they had a wall of Easter candies that legit reminded me of what I would shop for in a Dresden store. The staff was super helpful and encouraged me to come back soon-- I definitely will.  The staff will help you find things, especially when you realize how bad your German has become and don't know whether to cry tears of joy or sadness. Who knew a grocery store could be so cathartic?! You don't need therapy when you have German chocolates."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing selection of candy/ food imported from Europe. One of the best things that it offers is \"milk\" brand chocolates. They have a wide variety of types that you can not get anywhere else. Also in late October/ early November the store has beer advent calendar for sale. The calendars are amazing, but they sell out very quickly. Overall, this place is amazing. I would highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome!! We were able to find so many things from Germany that we love. Huge Beer selection, we also got some maggi, sweet mustard, garlic sauce and much much more. Very friendly staff, we will defiantly be going back for more shopping. It just like being in Germany"}
