{"text":"This is THE place Uptown for breakfast, lunch, and grab-and-go foods. The owners are hands-on, going the extra mile to greet you and to ensure that your meal is a good experience. All servers wait on all diners, so you may be assisted by several people. You can enter from 330 S. Tryon St. or from the side street. Go early on the weekend--before people wake up and get there before you do."}
{"text":"This restaurant had a nice, dependable breakfast. I got two scrambled eggs, a cup of berries, cinnamon toast, and an americano. My husband had a hash benedict thing that he really enjoyed. There were lots of other delicious sounding items on the menu that I would explore next time. i do wish they had yogurt, since this is my go-to breakfast item.  This place is located half underground with no windows and a kind of lousy ambiance, and then half at street level with more light. I'd probably try to eat at street level next time.  The service was nice, and there were plenty of creamers, butters and jams on the table."}
{"text":"It was my first time at the Famous Toastery and clearly won't be my last. I was greeted and seated immediately. Coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice arrived immediately. I love the fact they say \"every waiter is your waiter\".  Coffee was refilled as often as I wanted. I ordered the MBS omelet (mushroom, bacon and Swiss) which was out in under five minutes.  Enough for two people for sure!  Definitely worth trying when you're in Charlotte Uptown."}
{"text":"Food is SO good! Lots of options makes it hard to choose. Friendliest staff in all of Charlotte. Very fast and attentive service"}
{"text":"Toast makes its way Uptown...yay! I'm a fan...except of only the upstairs.  We parked on a side street around 9:00 a.m. and felt like we were the early bird diners and I'm glad it was that way because the restaurant was quiet. We did enter through the basement of sorts in the office building and were asked if we wanted downstairs or upstairs. So we walked through the downstairs which felt, literally, like a cafeteria, and when we went upstairs were pleasantly surprised with what felt like, well, a wonderful cafe with great windows and light.  I wouldn't eat in the lower floor, so we'll probably still find our way to Dilworth unless we knowingly are awake before the breakfast crowd rush (9:30 a.m.) to guarantee a seat upstairs  Service was AWESOME. we had such a sweet, bubbly blonde whom I wish I remembered her name because we was fabulous.  The food runners were kind as well, and just everyone seemed to be in a good mood."}
{"text":"Great find from Yelp reviews. The staff all work together making it a very friendly and attentive dining experience.  We were a two top and enjoyed the yogurt parfait, eggs and a turkey, melted brie cheese and raspberry puree. All fresh and delicious. The owner even stopped by to Thank you. Sir, you are welcome,  it was great. Compliments to you and the staff. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and read reviews before I choose where to eat. Menu and reviews looked good...but this place was no better than a fast food joint that has omelets on the menu. Veggies in omelet weren't fresh, and it was sliced pre-packaged cheese. Just gross. Best part of the meal was fruit salad. Oh, the waiter was also either hungover or just super unhappy to be there."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOO glad Downtown has this option.  Lunch options while working downtown are great, but bringing the Famous Toastery in is a game-changer. Breakfast.all.day.  The Turkey and Brie melt is a definate favorite.  Also love that every server is your server.  Feels like someone is always looking out for your table."}
{"text":"First stop after arriving to visit Charlotte .  Very attentive service, I think every server assisted in service for our table. Had hash & eggs, hash was one of the best homemade ever had.  Also, lobster omelette was pretty good.  Had bloody Mary's nice touch to finish with. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This location has alcohol! Not apparent on the website. They really live by the motto \"every server is your server\". All the servers were so nice and helpful. The owner, Justin, stopped by our table as well. Plenty of gluten free options, such as french toast (a must have!) I will definitely be back. The food and service was really good."}
{"text":"We felt so at home at the new Toastery in uptown Charlotte!  It just opened and we received excellent service and the food was amazing!  The atmosphere was really relaxing and nothing could have made it a better experience!  Great kids menu with chocolate chip pancakes and fruit!  Wonderful banana and walnut crepes! Thanks for making our visit to Charlotte a little like home."}
{"text":"We came here opening weekend and were very impressed! The food was delicious and reasonably priced, they had boozy coffee drinks, but the real difference was their customer service! Each server we spoke with was so nice and worked hard to make sure we had a great experience. The owner even stopped over at our table to make sure we enjoyed our meal. Definitely a great breakfast and we will be back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our trip to this diner, even though we got lost through the back entrance and ate in the cave.  We'll definitely try again through the main entrance and finding seating in the upper deck!  I liked the wall art, and we were a bit overwhelmed by the choices.  I got a hot chocolate, which is the only thing I regret ordering.  I ordered two main plates--a BYO omelette and a Benedict.  Both were delish.    My counterparts had the flavored waffles.  Apparently the blueberry was fabulous.  The apple, not so much.    The prices weren't too steep and it was nice to be able to flag down any server.  We weren't sure if we had to take the check up ourselves or if someone would take care of it for us.  We asked, and a server answered that she could take care of it--but in a way that we couldn't tell if she was doing us a favor or if this was the standard.  So we still don't know what we are _supposed_ to be doing...  Oh well.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great little joint for breakfast! The servers were super friendly and attentive. It's just a short walk from the downtown Hilton and conference center. They have menu options for health-conscious and vegetarian diners, as well as classic menu items for those who want a more traditional breakfast. The service was quick, our orders were correct, and (especially important before a long drive home) our coffee mugs stayed filled. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love the Famous Toastery.  I was excited that they were opening a location uptown near my work.   We went for a team celebration  today for breakfast.  I ordered my usual, the left coast blt with fruit.  My coworkers got some different varieties of omelettes that they were really pleased with!   The service was incredible.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"While walking to try to find Rhino Market, we accidentally found Toastery!!   The entrance is is located in a weird spot and kinda hard to describe.  We had to get on an elevator, go down a floor and then walk down the hall.  There are plenty of signs though to help direct you! It was almost like we were going to a secret club.  I also stood next to someone in Bon Jovi's band.  Apparently they were in Town for a concert the night before.  Phil X was his name.  Pretty cool.  Food/service was good and consistent with the other location on park road."}
{"text":"I loooove this location.  It is right on time and convenient.  Grab n gos in the morning are convenient."}
{"text":"Great portion sizes. And fresh ingredients. Came in for breakfast and got \"The Burrito\" with turkey sausage . Having a turkey option for breakfast often gets lost in transition so I'm thankful they offer it here. The burrito is jammed pack with veggies eggs, cheese and turkey sausage. It was $10 which is about on par for Uptown eating but the Burrito was big. Also you can get a flour or spinach wrap like I did. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Overall a pretty good place for breakfast!  I went here on a busy Sunday morning, and thankfully it was only about a 15 minute wait.  The waiters are super friendly, but say that their policy is that everyone is your waiter. Sounds great, but there were times were waiting for just anyone to come and take our order. A solid 10 mins went by before someone took at least a drink order.  Otherwise the food was delicious. I had the breakfast burrito and requested turkey sausage to be put in for extra flavor. I highly suggest this for those who have big appetites! My friend ordered the french toast and was easily impressed by its flavor and simplicity.  Avoid the hot chocolate because they just use the grocery store packets. Womp womp. Otherwise it seemed like the bloody marys and mimosas were popular so I would give that a try!"}
{"text":"The best place has the best OJ!  The service is good, it well lit and clean. This location has more seating downstairs or you can enjoy a street level view."}
