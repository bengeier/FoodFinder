{"text":"The food is beyond good it is absolutely great. You can taste the quality products they use in their menu selections. I've never had anything bad from Soul food on Hamilton. My husband holds business meetings there so he can introduce people to good soul food...since my husband is from Florida he use to complain about not have a good soul food restaurant around in Pittsburgh.  The owners are very nice and I just adore Ms. Mimi she recognizes my voice when I call for take out orders she even ask my husband about our babies when he's there....yes, I was sitting at this restaurant 5 days after delivering my youngest baby lol that's how good this place is. I forgot to mention this place is very CLEAN and the prices are awesome.  If you are in Pittsburgh and want good authentic soul food please check this place out they will not disappoint.  By the way the chicken and waffles are to die for and the mac n cheese is a wonderful blend of happiness and perfection"}
{"text":"I went there with a couple friends today. I ordered the wing dinner with Mac and cheese and fries.  The food was excellent. The price wasn't expensive either. If your looking for a good place to eat with a good atmosphere this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"First time being here, i had a friend recommend this place to me and im glad he did. Food was delicious! I got the wings with fries along with a side of Mac and cheese. I can usually finish my plate, but I was leaving with some to go. If your into wings, ribs, Mac and cheese ,etc. And other good food like that then you should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Not a fan! I went twice first time it was okay, lady sat down at table with me when she took my order, and the second time the lady was a little rude, also my food was burnt! I went in for a breakfast sand which for to go and when I sat down to eat it my turkey bacon was burnt! Will not return..."}
{"text":"Best soul food in Pittsburgh by far! I'm a southern boy born and raised. I was disappointed many times with the local bbque or \"soul food\" joints. I've found a home  away from home for collard greens, ribs, mac n cheese, fried chicken, ox tails, fish n grits, chicken n waffles, you name it! Tell Ms.Mee-Mee Big Maine sent you, she'll give you the hookup."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The salmon patties were fresh and delicious, just like my grandma used to make! I'm coming back for wings!"}
{"text":"I asked her how the pork chop is cooked, she said \"anyway you want\". That's when I knew I was in the right place. Great food, excellent environment and even better service. Its a mom and pop spot in the middle of Homewood where they call you \"baby\". A friendlier place you will not find. I laughed and participated in the light-hearted banter and joking. Call ahead for pick up or come and stay awhile.   The menu is small but that's because the real goodies are asked for. I came in directed by the sweet smells of the grill outside. After reviewing the limited menu I had decided on the pork chop but the menu didn't specify how it was cooked. When I asked she told me they would cook it anyway I want. However, in a conversation with the chef I was told that they had all manor of steaks it was no problem to change my order.   We had NY strip steak, greens, cabbage, and yams. The steak was slightly overcooked but beautifully seasoned and wonderfully tender. The greens and cabbage put me in soul food bliss and the yams were a sweet accompaniment to complete the meal.  I will definitely be back for breakfast or the 1-4 Sunday buffet."}
