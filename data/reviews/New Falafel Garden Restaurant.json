{"text":"Probably the best hidden gem in Brampton. Meat taste like premium meat not low grade dark meat often in other places."}
{"text":"Best shwarma I have ever had. I have tried to match it since moving out of the area, but can't, and have found myself traveling 35 kms out of my way to eat there when a craving hit. Tried to convince them to open one in Toronto purely for selfish reasons but no dice."}
{"text":"This place has the best tasting chicken shawarma in the gta! I have tried places all over and none can compare.
The owners, Matt and Moji are great people who are happy to have you in their restaurant.  
You can't judge a book by it's cover, the location does not stand out as anything special but the food certainly is. 
I will say it again, it is the BEST shawarma you will find! Though they do offer halal beef as well, I would suggest the chicken. 
A perfect side to have with your shawarma is the lentils and rice dish, served with fried onions on top and a lemon wedge on the side. 
Though not as authentic a side, the French fries are fabulous.
I think it's because they are fried in the same oil as the falafels which provides some extra flavor. 
Try this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarma in Brampton! The location is not great but don't let the look of the place turn you off. The food is great and the owner is very welcoming. If you have a few extra minutes I would recommend eating at the restaurant rather than taking out as the food is much fresher and better tasting that way."}
{"text":"I tried their chicken shawarma . Highly priced, was not freshly cooked and didn't taste like an sharwma at all!"}
{"text":"I accidentally stumbled upon this place. Not too impressive from the outside, but what comes out of this kitchen is magical!

By far, the BEST falafel I've ever had. The freshest and tastiest of everything. My daughter ran in and  ordered. When she returned to the car with my falafel, she said, \"Mommy, that is the nicest man in the world!\" I just started eating while she rambled on. I had heaven in my mouth! Next thing I knew, the owner came out to my car to make sure that I was enjoying it. He's as nice as she said, and his falafels are even nicer!"}
{"text":"Yes  the owner was right. Best falafel sandwich Ive had. Little spicy, little cabbage? (Thats interesting!) he also told me after he goes there is no family member to turn over restaurant to. Enjoy it now and while you can my Toronto friends. I bet its all awesome. Had the hummus too. It was decent. Ive had better but the falafel sandwich wowed me!  I really liked the service,too!"}
{"text":"I was a bit worried when I walked in at 12:20 on a Wednesday and only saw one other customer. 

Place is a bit run down,  every corner is used for storage,  tables are very sticky when you rest your arms. 

They have 5 topping for your sharawma:  tomatoes,  onions,  cabbage,  tabbouleh,  and hummus.  Surprised they dot have lettuce,  didnt care though I never put lettuce in my shawarma. 

You order first,  then sit.  I don't really like his because I want to see how much of each ingredient is going in.  The owner (I'm assuming)  then brings it to your table.  He is very nice and polite. 

The flavour was actually quite good,  hot sauce was great,  etc.  However the bread and chicken was very dry and the shawarma was very small. 

The chicken came from a glass casserole dish half covered with saran wrap.  You can tell the this dish used to be full,  no way of knowing if the chicken was from today or yesterday but it's obviously cold and dry.  Not sure why you don't get chicken straight off the spit when he clearly doesn't have the volume needed to cut in advance. 

My search for a good shawarma in Brampton continues. Not sure why this place has so many 5 stars, do people here have no standards? Did the quality change?"}
{"text":"3.5 Star

As another reviewer stated, they do use all white meat for their chicken shawarma. I went with the mixed chicken and beef platter, with the beef being gyro style.

The owner is indeed very gregarious and a joke-teller. The inside is functional at best and a bit rundown, but fine if you're just grabbing a quick bite.

Sorry, back to the platter... I dined in, and it was nice to eat off a real plate with real utensils. It's not cheap though, as the platter is $15 with tax. Even then, I feel that this could go for the best shawarma place in Brampton if it wasn't for the fact that my chicken was reheated. I'm sure there's practical reasons why it was done, but bottom line: even if the meat quality is good, it's going to affect the taste and dry it out a little.

There was still some very good taste however, with wonderful hot sauce and easily the best hummus in town. They gyro meat was also very good and I'd have to say I still enjoyed my meal overall. However, the higher pricing (even if it is white meat) and reheating of the chicken means that the experience can only go so far. If those issues were looked at, this place could be the first shawarma place in Brampton better than average, but based on how long the place has been open, I imagine things are likely to remain the same."}
{"text":"Winner winner chicken dinner! This place has a really solid chicken shawarma and what put it over the top was the service given to me! The owner of the place, Matt, greeted me as soon as I entered and was genuinely interested in how I was doing. He made sure he made the shawarma just right to my liking. 

Great Food and greater hospitality."}
{"text":"Love the chicken plate from here. Chicken might be warmed in the microwave when he is busy but it still tastes great. Love his samosa. Can't go wrong with most items at this spot."}
{"text":"I think this is my new favourite falafel and shawerma restaurant in Brampton. Great service. Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Whether in platters or as a sandwich (in a pita) the falafels and the chicken and beef shawarma are delicious and tangy. The samosas are homemade and very good. Spicy samosas are not unreasonably so. The rice is among the best I've ever had. You may have to ask for it as I don't think it's a posted menu item."}
{"text":"This is my pick for best shawarma shop around, don't let the tiny appearance trick you.. owner is super nice guy always making jokes, food is excellent.  All white meat shawarma is hard to come by outside of Montreal and Ottawa, this place has it.  Their homemade cole slaw topping for the sandwich is my favorite, and they use some kind of yogurt sauce that is really unique.  The homemade hot sauce is hot.  I just tried their rice & lentils with crispy fried onions and that was good too, as are their samosas 

A healthy and delicious alternative to the other stuff in the neighbourhood which is all pizza and mcdonalds..  5 out of 5 for Brampton"}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed... The food was sitting out on the counter, the cook used microwave to re-warm it up. Chicken meal was sent to me cold, not even warm, the beef was hot but all dried out, almost jerky like. 

Think it's best to keep driving right past it!"}
{"text":"This guy started to get to personal about religion. Don't tell me about your religion and question mine fool. Completely cold shwarma with brittle and dry pita bread."}
{"text":"Whoa!! Yelp rules truly.  Wanted Shawarma an found this place close to me. A very solo little building all by itself.  As the others reviewers said, don't judge a book by the cover!

First things first, it's small, family run affair. Comfy.  The staff esp the young lady at the counter absolutely amazing.  Found out I was there first time and showed me as such.  

The shawarma's itself different from normal.  I guess more authentic.  Beautifully done.  The chicken was delicious and very fragrant.  I tried cabbage in the shawarma for the first time, gave a very interesting and almost akin to a bite / tangy taste to it.  Was no doubt one of the best if not the best shwarma's I've had.  I'll be honest in my shawarma it seemed there was a lot of oil? It was dripping.  Was going to give this place a 4* cuz of that.  But then I ordered the Turkish Coffee, again the girl explained how in Turkey they read the horoscopes and stuff with the coffee, taught me how to drink it at the end, then came to the table, showed me and even read my horoscope for me! That was different.  Did I mention the coffee was delicious?  It was.  5 Star right there!

To top it all off as I was sitting there she gave me samosa on the house! Super crispy, delicious and again a little more oil that I'd like, but still. 

Def a place to check out for sure!"}
{"text":"The shawarma pita gets 5 stars for the taste, also a good meal if your trying to eat healthy as he uses white meat. Haven't tried the plate yet but it seems quite pricey 12.50 before tax, I never like spending more than 10-11 max after taxes. Pita is kinda small but the taste hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarma in Brampton. Owner is friendly and cool. They deserve all the accolades."}
{"text":"Honestly, I feel bad for writing this review since the owner was soo nice. But this shawarma was not the best I ever had, like the owner promised. It was actually terrible. No garlic, carbage instead of rice? No flavour etc. 
I stopped by here since I was hoping to find a good shawarma place in the area, as it seems like Toronto and Scarborough have the best shawarma. End result; I'd rather drive to Toronto for shawarma."}
{"text":"Good shawarma. It has a unique taste. Not your typical shawarma.  I like how it's filling but doesn't make you feel guilty.  It's a plus for white meat that actually taste good. 

Not the best location nor does it look great but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best chicken shawarma i have had ( and I've tried meany, many places in different cities of North America)! During our five day annual trip to Toronto we eat here at least four/five times! Don't let the appearance put you off...its a must have! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Chicken was dry and kinda cold.
Food needed more seasoning and salt.
$12.99 for a plate. Not worth it.
When we ordered he told me to go pick any drink I like so I thought it was included in the price like a combo. Then in the end I was charged for additional it!!! So shady!

Won't be back"}
