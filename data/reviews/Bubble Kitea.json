{"text":"Great little place for bubble tea. Fast, friendly service (although we did visit when there were no other customers). Prices are very fair too which gave this place the 5th star. They've got 3 sizes, which makes it more affordable for people that just want a small cup. Love the cat motif and the Chi's Sweet Home merchandise on display is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great bubble tea place in Mississauga. Not too busy and the staff is courteous/polite. Very clean/nice atmosphere to stay or for takeout. The bubble tea itself is so-so, but price is quite good compared to other locations in Mississauga. The menu is quite varied and has all the basics covered. The mixes are quite tasty too, though my favourite remains to be the chiller."}
{"text":"If you enjoy disapointment... This is the place for you... There was no taro, no litchi jelly, and a few other things .... There was one lady which made it very slow... She also sampled all of the drinks before giving them you.... As for the taste... It's pretty good..."}
{"text":"Amazing bubble tea (kitea tea is so yummy)!! Some dim sum food options too. Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Really love Bubble Kitea's bubble teas!! I've had many there before, but the most recent purchase I had the bubble test was a bit to sweet for my liking, so I would suggest asking for half the sugar on the Strawberry Green tea bubble tea. Overall fantastic!! And the prices are great too!!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly owner.  Drinks and food here are great and at a good price.  It looks like they're expanding their menu.  Owner says they may serve Vietnamese sandwiches or Vietnamese subs?  Looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and I always get strawberry milk bubble tea. They are always very kind and although it takes a little long, I don't mind waiting since they have cute fish to look at next to the menu on the wall. You might not see people sitting down in Bubble Kitea as most people only go in to grab a drink and leave. I recommend this place if you're looking for a quiet atmosphere and a tasty drink."}
{"text":"After craving some bubble tea, I decided to stop by this cute little cat-themed store since the usual Chatime or Bubble Republic were too far, and to my surprise, I was greatly impressed! I had the Kitea Milk Tea, and it was exceptionally good! Although a little on the sweeter side, the prices here are extremely cheap when compared to other bubble tea joints.    Service was a little slower than usual places but the server took his time to taste our drinks.  There was a younger server who seemed a tad fidgety, and nervous, but overall I was very happy with my visit."}
{"text":"Came back to use my stamp cards and the server said we don't have to pay for tapioca to make it easier for us! Usually other places are super strict on having to pay for tapioca but he was kind enough to give us the free drinks with the tapioca. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Picked this place because we were in the area and reviews all generally seemed good. The interiors are pretty cute, lots of cat decor because of the name! They have a wide menu of bubble tea and slush drinks, and they also sell snacks like twinkies and little cakes.   I ordered the mango milk tea with mango pearls and my friend got the honeydew milk tea. Pretty disappointed about our drinks, they were very watery! Couldn't really taste the flavored that well. I actually started feeling sick after drinking (and I didn't have anything before that so I'm pretty sure it's from my drink.) Disappointed and probably won't come here again!"}
{"text":"Meh, just meh.  Really nothing spectacular..I opted for their special Kitea milk tea and a taro chiller. Milk tea was just the regular black tea with milk and taro chiller had too much ice it was bland. The Tapioca's were nicely cooked and perfectly sweet but the tea wasn't outstanding. Service was slow although they were very nice, it took them 10 minutes to for two bbts with no line up."}
{"text":"We went to this place because it's close by our way,  and what a serendipitous find!!  The cappuccino black milk tea is strong on both espresso and black tea flavor.  I expected it to be like a Hong Kong yin-yan but this version is more intense.  And not overly sweet like some bubble tea places.  Chewy,  perfectly cooked bubbles. Hubby said it's better than any in Miami,  though that's not a high benchmark at all.   I like how the drinks come in 3 sizes and many options.  Service is prompt and friendly too.  This place has a cute cat motive,  from the name (kitea) to the decor.   There is a shelf filled with tumblers and ceramic featuring Chi,  a manga cat.  I love Chi!!!"}
{"text":"Great service! Very fresh tapioca (made fresh daily). Lots of flavours to choose from. Good place to chill with friends as there's games here. Casual shop with dim sum and snacks. Smells yummy here all the time"}
{"text":"I have been to this little spot many times and have had consistently good Bubble Tea and service each time - which is great because you can expect a certain standard!  I recommend the Taro Chiller and their house milk tea \"Bubble Kitea\" (it is a little sweeter than most but does have a distinct original taste).   I've ordered their beef and vegetable patties as well as their dim sum. The food is not top notch but they specialize in Bubble Tea so I am not disappointed.  Overall, I would go again and again. It is a much better environment than the other crowded, overrated bubble tea spots in Mississauga and it is worth the price point. There is a much more humble and welcoming vibe at Bubble Kitea."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times and decided to try it today since I was in the area for a bike ride.  I walked in and it was not busy at all... But it is 1:30 on a Friday afternoon.  The atmosphere is small and quaint with a food section, places to sit and the area to get your bubble tea/order.  There were many selections on what type of bubble tea to get, so I tried the Friday special which was a mango milk bubble tea with tapioca.  The server made my drink very quickly and mixed it with mango powder, milk and black tea.  He made sure it was good by tasting it before giving it to me, which is appreciated.  The price was pretty standard.. $4.70 for a medium and that's with tapioca.  I definitely enjoyed the taste and did not taste artificial.  The tapioca was nice and chewy and soft.  Definitely will come here again, but not after a bike ride.  The medium was a bit too large for me. I suggest getting the small if you don't want too much milk in your system Great local bubble tea place  Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Update: There are new owners now and some of the staff make the drinks very watered down. I always order a Honey Green Milk Tea, and it's usually always sweet and refreshing, but lately it's just been tasting like milk. The quality of the bubble tea isn't as good as before. The owner himself makes the drinks great, anyone else is questionable. I used to come here atleast once or twice a week, I haven't been back since I literally paid $5 for a cup of milk."}
{"text":"Avoiddddddd! Heard terrible things about the drinks here so I decided to go for the food. Ordered har gow, shumai, and lotus wrapped rice. It took twenty minutes: the hargow was fine, the shumai was still uncooked, and they ran out of the rice (after I already paid for it by the way). take heed and get outta this place ASAP"}
{"text":"This bubble tea place is quite cute. The bubble tea was good, but what stood out was the fact they served Chinese dim-sum for food."}
{"text":"Cute cat themed bubble tea place. This place is conviently located near UTM. I usually come by with my friends after class. I love their peach green tea and their strawberry green tea bubble tea. The kitea milk tea is also pretty good. They have an okay variety of bubble tea you can choose from. They also have some herbal jelly desserts and If you're hungry they have some dim sum and snacks you can order.   The place is usually pretty empty, the drinks and food are reasonably price and is slightly cheaper than other bubble tea places. Collect their stamp card, buy 10 get 1 free!"}
{"text":"People are nice here however it is really slow. I waited 30 mins when there's no line up for two bubble teas and dim sum... Do not go if your looking for high quality milk tea.."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... better than your regular mall powdery and sugared bubble tea.  So in south Mississauga near the UTM area, usually there's not much there but in cute little strip mall you have Bubble Kitea.  It's pretty tiny so parking is not much but the stripmall looks more village-like than your other spots.  Bubble Kitea is small, sparse, and clean.  When you first walk in, you think they have some baked goods... nope.  It's just holding spot for commercially re-sold goods (twinkies, chocolate bars, and wheelcakes).  Oh well.  Service here is polite and quiet.  It has cash or debit only... NO CREDIT CARDS!  They seem to do more powdered mixes than tea based drinks.  So you'll have everything from blueberry, taro, kiwi, or papaya.  Typical flavours that no actual tea house will replicate.  Their drink menu has your typical milk based teas, smoothies, and just teas.  They do have a small meal menu but we didnt try it.  It looks to be simple things like ramen and some dim sum.  Looking at the area, it didnt seem to be made  in house but I could be wrong.  Prices are fair for Mississauga which I know is expensive for Toronto usually.    Kitea Black Tea - This was surprisingly well done.  After seeing all the powders, I was worried.  This has a deep robust black tea flavour and it was nicely balanced after asking for half sweet.  I think for GTA West, it was a very good cup.  I enjoyed this. 4/5  Strawberry Banana Slushie - This was quite funny... it is a surprising bright pink shade.  I did like how they really grinded up the ice super fine... no big chunks like some other places in GTA.  The taste is really sweet and artificial but in a nostalgic way.  The scent of fake bananas and strawberry hits you hard and brings me back to my childhood while eating Runts (powder candy in the shape and flavour of fruits).  I wouldn't order this a lot because its so sweet but it does make me smile as if I was eating cotton candy.  3.5/5  Though there is spots to sit down and drink, I think the atmosphere is too quiet.  It's ok if you just want to chill while reading a book. If you're looking for bubble tea in the middle of the south, at least you dont have to travel all the way to Square One area to grab one."}
{"text":"The bubble tea here is great, but be prepared to taste artificial powdery flavours depending on which you choose.  Not as great as Chatime, but then again, it's cheaper here, and the service is great.  I had the Coconut Malt Milk Tea as suggested by Sky, and I was greatly impressed.  I was told this was a unfamiliar flavour but they would customize it for me.  It was very good and didn't taste as artificial as my friend's Avocado Green Tea (not real avocado; powder).  Nonetheless, I think if you pick your flavours wisely, this place is great! Also, prices are lower in comparison to other places, making the money-conscious feel less guilty about their bubble tea addictions."}
{"text":"Conveniently located close to UTM. I recommend their chiller drinks in the banana, strawberry, or honeydew flavours as they're refreshing during the summer time. I've noticed that they have started selling more edibles like snack cakes (e.g. Twinkies), butter tarts, and instant noodles which may help with late night studying.   They have daily specials for their drinks as well as stamp cards for loyal customers."}
{"text":"I found the drinks to be quite average and would prefer it to be cheaper for the quality. However, the decor and theme of the place was cute and the employees are always friendly!"}
