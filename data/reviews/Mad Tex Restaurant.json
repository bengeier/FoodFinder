{"text":"I ate here with my husband a while back, and also noticed that the appearance hadn't changed at all from when they were Suds n Sliders.  Neither of us particularly enjoyed our food.  It wasn't terrible, but nothing I'd want to eat again.  We haven't been back and probably won't go again.  The menu seemed good, but the execution of the food was disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food and drinks are never a disappointment.  I usually go in here around lunch time and there is never a wait or too much of a crownd.  Which I do not understand with how good this place is.  I love there burrito bowl, vegetarian and regular margarita.  You do have to pay for chips and salsa, but it's less than a dollar.  You do have to wait a bit for your food, but it's because they prepare it from scratch when you order.  Something I don't mind waiting the extra time for.  The service is always good and I love the atmosphere.  Just ate out on the patio for the first time (they have a full bar out there!) and I can't wait for the weather to improve again and go back out there!"}
{"text":"Had fish tacos and a dos Equis. Mediocre meal I wouldn't pay 19 bucks for again.  Rice and beans on the side were upscale versions of what you might expect from chipotle. But both were bland and al dente. Atmosphere was nice, ESPN on the tv and clean tables. I'd go back and try something else when I get bored of burntwood tavern."}
{"text":"My husband and a friend and myself stopped at the Mad-Tex Saturday night (4/17/14) looking for a place for dinner and drinks.  There was plenty of room at the bar.  Bartender was very friendly.  Rrestaurant was very clean. There were plenty of drink choices.  We had a few beers and then we order our meal. I had the Mad Bowl (like Chipolte burrito bowl) very tasteful and filling.   My husband had an enchiladas (very tasteful) and our friend had a burger- he stated it was very yummy.  We also order the Brussel Sprouts as a side (I know it sounds weird) but they were delicous and the first thing we finished.   I would  recommend this restaurant  for a nice quick dinner.  Prices were from $9.00 to $12.00"}
{"text":"I've been here three times.  Once when it was Suds N Sliders and twice since the change.  Three strikes you're out.  The chicken sliders were dry and flavorless, but hey don't even serve those anymore so I guess I can't really be too critical.  The second time I went back I had something off of the Mex menu and although it was adequate, it was far from delicious.  The guacamole was bland and obviously full of more dairy than avocado.  The bright spot was the house made hot sauce but that wasn't enough to save the meal.  The third time I went I decided to have a burger. I feel it's important to point out that making burgers out of Wagyu beef is absurd and wastes the prized beef which should be served intact. Wagyu is highly marbled which is what makes it desirable.  The fat content of ground beef is routinely adjusted up and down to taste anyway, so why waste the expensive beef when you can just grind up the ordinary beef and throw in some extra fat to the mix?  Anyway, you'd think with such a quality ingredient they could produce a decent meal but they really don't.  The pretzel bun was good and they were willing to put most of your common toppings on it, but that's about all the good I can say for it.  I ordered the burger medium and it came out extra well done.  I have a real moral aversion to wasting food so I didn't send it back, but for a burger place to screw up a burger that bad is unforgivable.   I look forward to the day when this place goes under so it can be replaced with something good.  Fingers crossed for an Indian joint."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night and it was pretty empty. It was very bright for being about 830pm - when a lot of places dim the lights. We had to buy chips and salsa. Then I got a margarita with salt on the rim. They forgot the salt. Also, it was in a normal tumbler which takes half the fun out of drinking a margarita. It didn't taste very good but could have been the lack of salt.  The food was ok. My rice and beans side were pretty bland. Both with the burger meal and especially the chimichanga, the paper underneath deteriorated making it hard to cut the chimichanga and not eat paper."}
{"text":"I decided to go in here last night while I was waiting for the pizza I ordered for my husband from Augies. Its been a long time since I've been in this area since moving to Streetsboro. I was surprised by the changes and all the new restaurants to the area. I hadn't read any of the previous reviews prior to going. I had no idea that it was Suds and Sliders.  I like to judge places for myself. Everyone has different taste. You say tomato and I say tomatoe.  My plan was to 1) see if they had something for me to order. Since I'm on a low carb diet, pizza doesn't seem logical and throwing out good delicious pizza crust is just plain ludicrous.  2)Check the place out and see if it would be a Burger/Mex spot to bring my husband (he isnt a fan of Red Robins or The Melt across the street).  The decor and atmosphere is cool, plenty of space. However,  I was shocked it wasn't packed for a Friday night, just a handful of patrons (literally) including myself. Guess everyone was at Red Robin or The Melt, LOL!  I sat at the bar and was greeted promptly.  The waitress handed me a menu for take out.  After careful review I chose to get a quesadilla with chicken for the hubby. A safe choice for me to get him at this point. A chicken quesadilla is one of his go to at any restaurant.  Even though they had chimichungas (the Mex side) on the menu, another favorite of his, I have good sense to know he likes them cooked and deep fried a certain way. If they were to screw that up I would never hear the end of it and never get him to go and sit down to order a burger. So better safe than sorry for now.  For myself (low carber), the cubano sandwich. This is BBQ pulled pork (another hubby fav) ham, cheese, their version of cole slaw (a fancy spicy mayo dressing), aioli, pickles with your choice of bun(whole wheat, white, or pretzel). Mine of course, no bun. All sandwiches and burgers come with fries. I declinex on the fries (darn low carb diet) an was forced to order the only veggie they had on the menu, olive oil pan seared brussel sprouts with bacon and a whole lot of garlic.  Let me just say this, I hated brussel sprouts as a child, I hate them as an adult and if I ever have kids they would never have to worry about me cooking that God awful vegetable. Now, if I return I'll order the sprouts (only if I'm still low carb) they were good but I would prefer grease ladened fries any day of the week. My sandwich minus the bun was bursting with flavor. Before, I said my husband is the pull pork expert but for me this was darn good and I would order it again. They give you a generous amount of pork and the coleslaw to me added an extra flair. I wish it had some pickled jalapenos.  The jury is still out on the old man's opinion. I say go with friends after work for happy hour and enjoy drinks, funky burgers, sandwiches or some Mexican food.   One valuable piece of advice.  Have gum, Binaca spray, Colgate wisp or those neat Listerine strips handy if you decide to order the garlic ladened sprouts as not to offend those your with. Or ask the chef to lighten up on the garlic. You'll thank me later for it.  I'll probably never get this garlicky taste out my mouth!!!   Update 3/8/2014; The hubby liked the quesadilla and is willing to try their chimichungas."}
{"text":"Cool place. Decent beer and whiskey selection. Fun old rock/Texas decor. Hendrix on stereo. Menu is burgers, chicken, other meat options and a small but good Mexican variety. My waitress was very nice and helpful. Was greeted upon entering. Maybe they read the other bad reviews and made some needed changes. Would return."}
{"text":"Heather is cool and the wings were really good (jerk or buffalo) margarita was decent tasty...very clean..nice selection of bourbons and whiskey....def will return"}
{"text":"Cool Name.  Cool Decor.  Other than that, not much to say.  We went, options weren't really anything special.  Taste was cheap and bland.  Overpriced.  Wont be going back."}
{"text":"I agree with most who have reviewed - great decor, very clean, our waitress was very good - but I can't say the same for the food.   The fish tacos had a fishy taste and the best thing in them was the red cabbage. The Brussel sprouts were very greasy (cooked w bacon so I know this can happen but there was a puddle of grease). Plus the prices were expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"No changes inside from when it was Suds and Sliders, except for a few paintings. I asked the waitress/bartender what was different, and she said that they changed the name (same owners) because they expanded the menu. It was totally dead on a weekday evening for dinner. In addition to my table (I was only with one other person), there was another two top, and a guy came in for a beer and then left. The food was just okay.   We had guacamole to start, which was ... sadly below average. Nothing was wrong with it, but there was nothing interesting or remarkable. Honestly, the guac you can buy at any grocery store (or hey, a building over at Drug Mart) in a tub that's mass produced is actually better. That makes me a little sad. If a place is tex mex style, shouldn't the guac be at least decent? Enough about my guac meh-ness. I had a burrito, which was similarly slightly below average. Again, nothing wrong with it. The weird thing was it was a little cold, like it'd been sitting. My dining partner's meal was warm, so who knows.   I feel like it's difficult to get a new restaurant to succeed in this space. It's set back from the road a little in a plaza, and there are significantly better restaurants all around. Hell, there's a Chipotle in the same plaza where you can get a better burrito for a few bucks less. My server was very friendly and nice, and they had several tvs (the better to get my baseball fix on, my dear), but the food was just so... meh. It was also fairly bland, which I guess since I'm recovering from ulcers is a good idea but doesn't exactly make my taste buds dance. Or sing. Or even wake up."}
{"text":"Our first, and LAST time for this place.  I went with my wife and daughter on a Saturday night.  We chose this location after driving around looking for a place to eat that we would not have to wait a long time.  The parking lot was not over crowded nor was the restaurant.  There were 4 other tables occupied and a few people at the bar.  We ordered and waited over 45 minutes for our food to be delivered to our table.  My wife ordered coffee because the place was cold.  20 minutes later when she asked the waitress her response was \"I think I forgot to push the button to turn it on.\"  There are TVs across the walls and behind the bar.  While we waited I was watching a football game and the bartender came walking by changing the channel on all the TVs because the Ohio State game was on (20 minutes later)...  His rude actions, the long wait for food that was so so and the inattention of the wait staff will keep us and friends away.   The couple at the next booth left after waiting for 30 minutes for their food."}
{"text":"I love the salsa - definitely spicy enough.  The empanadas were delicious - chose the carnitas which includes pineapple and the red sauce on top paired very well.  I also really enjoyed the tortilla soup."}
{"text":"The food was not bad, but it wasn't very good. This is the type of Mexican-type restaurant that doesn't have any hot sauce or salt and pepper on the tables. And you have to buy your own chips and salsa. Clean and acceptable but not a winner."}
{"text":"Only been here once so far, but it was very good.  Went with my wife and 5 year old.  We all ended up getting burgers, and it was definitely the best burger I've had in the Parma/Independence area.  A little expensive, but everything seemed high quality.  We got tots instead of fries, and they were also very good, although they give you a very small portion.  But I walked out full and satisfied.  I'll be back to try a few of the different burgers and maybe some Mexican."}
