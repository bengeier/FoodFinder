{"text":"Possibly the best Vietnamese subs in town! It's a small hole in the wall but you are always served fast and with friendly service.

The gentleman that owns it is very friendly and always checks to make sure that you are not allergic to anything.

My personal favourite sub is the chicken and beef satay combo. I do find that the chillies are quite hot so I ask for only a few.

If you are ever in China town you have to make a stop here for lunch!"}
{"text":"Perfect, attentive family-style service. The only thing better were the subs! Amazing. Easily beats Thi-thi around the corner. 

Cash only."}
{"text":"This is a small vietnamese sub shop near the entrance of the Far East Center.

They make a great satay chicken/beef combo vietnamese sub.  So delicious and spicy.  The man and woman who work here are super friendly and remember the orders of the regulars.

It can get busy at lunch and has limited seating but you can take your sub to one of the nearby food courts.

The only downside to this place is that their drink making machine is really loud."}
{"text":"I used to only go to Thi Thi for Viet subs (and I'm boring - I only ever get the assorted) but the long lines at lunch were quite brutal, so I checked out Trung Nguyen one day and seriously has never gone back to Thi Thi.  The subs here are just as good (I'm only speaking for the assorted) and I find the service friendlier."}
{"text":"I'm a die hard fan of Thi Thi but I also enjoy the subs at Trung Nguyen. Both places offer similar pricing and subs, but they taste different. I like the sauciness of the assorted sub, how pickled the carrots are, and the lightness of the baguette at Thi Thi. At Trung Nguyen I like the proportion of veggies, meat to bread ratio, the flavour of the sate chicken sub, and the shorter line-up.

I picked up some subs for a Sunday afternoon feast and I was impressed with service from the female owner at Trung Nguyen. She told me to call her the next time and she would bring it outside so I wouldn't get a parking ticket. What a sweetie! Now that's service."}
{"text":"I live south of Calgary and unfortunately can't help but drive all the way downtown just to get their subs.  if I don't have the time to go here, I don't bother anymore.  I've tried them all and I've yet to find a satay sub that I like as much as these.  My daughter won't even bother with a sub if they aren't from here.  I always get exactly what I want...   lots of fresh toppings, a generous amount of meat and the buns .... always fresh!

Everyone else talks about satay subs but are they really satay subs?  I think not.  Have you ever googled what satay really is?  It's not soya sauce with a bit of seasoning .... it's a PEANUT BUTTER sauce that contains soya sauce and other seasonings.  So tell me, who uses a real satay sauce:  Trung Nguyen and ..... exactly, nobody else!!    

If you haven't tried these subs, you should. And yes, she can be abrupt at times.  So what?  there's likely 20 people coming in behind you.  She takes great care of her regulars and she's a hoot if you take the time to chat with her.  I only have to wave a 1 or 2 (for the # of subs I want) and I'm good to go.  I love this place and will remain a dedicated fan... satay beef & honey garlic chicken with extra cucumber/no onions"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese subs in town.  Careful of the spice - with all the spicy ingredients it gets hot, but is very good no matter how you have it!"}
{"text":"Trung Nguyen is a tiny Vietnamese spot inside the Far East shopping centre. It's in the same centre as Auntie's Chinese Burger.

A regular bubble tea costs $5.00. Kind of weird that there's no sign for their bubble tea prices. I came on a Sunday afternoon and was the sole customer. There are a few tables outside where you can eat but I presume most people do a quick grab and go.

Trip #1
- Avocado mango ($6.00) - this was my first time so I had to get my go to bubble tea. They charge an extra $1.00 to get a second fruit. The toppings are limited so don't bother asking for grass jelly or other \"fancy\" toppings. The lady almost freaked out on me (aka. ranting that they don't make any \"fancy\" drinks) but I let it slide because the drink turned out better than expected. I was pleasantly surprised and vowed to come again.

Trip #2
- Assorted (cold cut) banh mi ($5.50) - their banh mi's range from $5.50 to 8.00. I went with the classic assorted cold cut and took this all the way back home to eat for dinner later. Popped it into the toaster oven and it was good as new. They gave me the works and everything was spot on except they were a little heavy handed on the mayo.

- Mango bubble tea ($5.00) - I decided to try a regular mango. Originally, I was going to pass on a BBT because one of the workers said they were out of pearls but he checked with one of the ladies and she had a bit leftover. MISTAKE right there. Never get the bottom of the barrel pearls. It wasn't all bad but there was a bunch of pearls that were hard, frozen and just plain gross. The mango also tasted like some type of orange juice was mixed in with it. So I was tasting more of that then the supposedly fresh mango.

This place is what it is and by no means am I judging it harshly. It's fast, cheap and perfect if you want banh mi to go but I'm on the fence when it comes to their bubble tea. 3.5 stars. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Best Viet subs in Calgary run by the most amazing husband and wife team you can meet. It is a sad day when they are heading back home on vacation because it usually means they will be closed for 2 weeks but it makes you want it more!!  The satay beef is tender and spicy. The sides are crisp and fresh. The baguette is always fresh soft inside and crisply toasted to perfection. I recommend the duck for that extra flavour explosion.

Now lets talk about the service... don't get me wrong, this is a hole in the wall in a really crappy mall you probably didn't know was there but the owners treat the 4 small tables that they have outside in the mall like a 5 star restaurant and always make you feel like a welcome guest. You order and they tell you not to pay until you are finished, they make sure you a have a seat, come and check on you and make sure you had a great meal. I love these guys.

One last secret... if you call ahead it will be ready for you 'to go' or if you order a sub for lunch they can also make you one to go and the put the veggies in a small bag so you can toast the bread, meet and cheese and add the fresh veggies after.  Masterful."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 7 years and the quality has been just as amazing! I always get the Satay Beef sub and it's a very good deal for a lot of food. Subs range from $5.50 to $7 and $8 for the fancier ones. Haven't tried their newer flavours like buffalo chicken but you cannot go wrong with their classics. Also it's cash only."}
