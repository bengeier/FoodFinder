{"text":"Went to this place on someone's recommendation for chappli kebab and karahi. The food was ok but I was highly disappointed with the decore and environment of the restaurant it smelled funny. And poor hygiene. The staff was not friendly at all."}
{"text":"Finally a place with a real specialty, Kabuli Pulao with mutton shank (rice and goat shank bone). No one in Calgary offer this dish, you must try it.  Other items which I have tried and can recommend: 1- Fresh naan (real authentic Afghani/Pakistani naan), plain or roghani (oiled) 2- Garlic naan (you would eat it right away) 3- Choopan kabab (Sheppard's kabab) 4- Chicken Karahi (must give them at least 45 minutes to cook it properly)  Seating and service is not that great but owner, Zabeeh Ullah tries his best to manage guests and kitchen at the same time. Owner is from Afghanistan and speaks Pashto, Dari (Afghan Farsi), Urdu and English."}
{"text":"Ordered a take out at 658pm I am still waiting at 811pm. I was told it be 30mins. Not impressed. Will try this place one more time to give it a fair chance."}
{"text":"Fast service. Amazing food. The chargha is awesome! It's a small place with only 4 or so tables, and their focus is takeout. The naan is not too heavy and not greasy, and you can ask for me raita! The beef skewers are also super great."}
{"text":"Great food, loved the Kabuli Pulao - we went and got the Kabuli Pulao, Afghan seekh kabobs and some naan.  The service was great but it was a little bit of a wait to get our food (even though there was just one other family in the restaurant that already had their food brought to them before we got there).   Will definitely be going back but only if I have extra time.  The food was delicious!  Give them a try."}
{"text":"This was good! It's small - 4 or 5 tables, I think - and they seem to do a lot more take out than eat in.  However, when we sat down at the table, they were very accomodating.  We went to the counter to order (traditional Afghan dish; I forget what it was called, but included rice with raisins and spices, beef or chicken and a salad) and then sat at the table and they brought our food out.  It was excellent, and one serving large enough that I took leftovers home for the next day.  However, when we'd finished eating, we noticed they were cutting up what looked like fresh, filled naan bread for a take out order.  It looked outstanding, and made me wish I hadn't already eaten so much... but alas, too full.  Will be returning!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Afghani Kabli Pulav with lamb schank, Afghani kabaab, Chopan Tikka Kabaab, Chicken Karahi, 5 naans, and drinks. The food was delicious and it wasn't very oily. The owners served us with care. The restaurant is Afghani and they are just starting out so they don't have servers and the washrooms needed attention. The kitchen looked fairly clean. The food fed three adults and it cost $70. I rated it 4 solely based on taste of food and service."}
