{"text":"Blueberry banana bread!!! It was so Yummy. Everything that we have gotten for breakfast has been wonderful. At the time we go in 7am they just have opened so its quite. But the staff is always nice and on there toes. Even though it is morning you can always have a slice of famous pie or one to go!!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently good and at such a low price. It is like home made. The staff never wants you to miss a deal, if you buy a drink you get the salad bar cheaper etc. The pies are amazing. Just good food. The world needs a good, affordable place to eat when you work all the time!!"}
{"text":"I'd always wanted to eat at one of these! I'm from the South and had always heard that it was the only place to get southern-style food out west. Not exactly true, but it IS hard to find! 

I've been here twice and both times the food was very tasty. I think the prices are too high for this type of food or I would have given it a better rating. I almost always try to get some pie; the French apple is the best! Oh my god - so good! They also have sweet tea, so yes. 

Customer service is usually a nice elderly lady. In fact, most of the clientele are elderly people or families. You won't find the glitz and glamour of Vegas here; just regular salt of the earth folks. :p"}
{"text":"Marie Callendar's is one of those places I always forget about.  The food is pretty darn good, and don't forget about the pies!!

My Mom and I stopped in for dinner while we were out shopping recently.  She had seen an ad that they had a special for a \"mini\" pot pie, served with caesar salad and a slice of pie for $9.99.  That's a pretty great deal, and the pot pie was really delicious - not to mention the banana cream pie she had (her favorite)!

I had chicken piccatta, which was surprisingly amazing.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the salad bar with it, which wasn't exciting - I would say that the selection could use some work.  I also had a slice of the kahlua cream pie (or something) and it was really decadent, and pretty darn good!

The service was OK - a little slow, but we were there not long before closing and there weren't a lot of other tables.

The prices are a little bit high, but the portions are fair in size and the food is always good.

I heard the server telling another table that they sell something like 100,000 pies during Thanksgiving week ALONE.  That is nuts!  Make sure you stop in to buy a pie when they are on sale for $7.99 (just about anytime but the holidays).  There is a small charge for the tin as well, so bring yours back and they will give you a credit."}
{"text":"Pies. I like pies.

However, the pies are very expensive if you purchase one when they do not have their sales.

We purchased a pecan pie the week before thanksgiving and paid almost $18.00

However, the pie was fresh and decadent. The service was good, fast and speedy. 

I do love their pies, however I will have to wait till the next time they are $7.99"}
