{"text":"This place offered a pretty good selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The breakfast was my favorite.  They had a buffet for about 15 bucks which included juice, coffee, eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, pigs in a blanket, ham, omelette station, Belgian waffles, a variety of different breads, and muffins.  I say give it a try."}
{"text":"Service is almost always slow and food is just okay. Even my beer was warm tonight. Kinda of pricey but what do you expect out of a hotel restaurant?"}
{"text":"Restaurant had pretty tasty food for a Hilton.  The bar wasn't very busy but it took a while for the bar tender to show up.  Even the bar maid had to go in behind the bar to get her own limes."}
{"text":"Good service and fantastic steak sandwich.  My girlfriend had the burger and loved it."}
{"text":"Overall restaurant experience was bad. This is based on 3 factors:  Food quality, decor & service. The taste of my hamburger was very bland. The fries were soggy and room temperature at best. The decor was something from the far past. Dark interior and uninspired menus. Lastly, the server was the redeeming quality. She was nice and somewhat prompt and I'll leave it at that. In summary these 3 factors contributed to a unpleasant dining experience and I cannot in good faith recommend this place as a destination for dining."}
{"text":"Good service. Good food. Good beer. Clean.   Other than that not much to brag about.   Ate at the bar- was given a good recommendation by the bartender Mikey G to try the Seared Salmon Spinach Salad. . . I was so intrigued that I went for it. The salmon was overcooked to be called \"seared\" but it was not overcooked in general and it was delicious.   Blue Moon on draught. Tap water was good- didn't taste like chlorine or margarita mix, which was a great change from the standard hotel bar.    I would go there again."}
{"text":"Standard hotel bar/grille. If you expect more, you'll be disappointed. I had an interesting \"grilled cheese\", since it included pesto, chicken, tomatoes, etc. but it was pretty good.   We also had the breakfast buffet the next morning. Again, standard breakfast buffet fare, but it was hot, tasty, and the staff was very attentive. One could certainly do worse!"}
{"text":"After checking in to the hotel, we decided to give this place a try once we saw \"Carne Asada\" on the menu.  Husband order d Carne Asada Nachos and I got the Carne Asada Taco. We were impressed on how tender the steak was.  We assumed it was going to be tough with no flavor.  We were wrong. The chips was fresh and not stale. Everything was tasty.  Our server was super friendly. We decided on dessert...Chocolate Molten Cake. It was really good."}
{"text":"Slow service tonight. Food was good fast after ordering and hot. Very well seasoned.   Pretzels and cheese and steak tacos...."}
{"text":"My husband has visited this Bar / Grill before when we had our honeymoon but since then the bar has gone down in service and quality of service as far as the bartenders. We ate there tonight and the service from the bartender named Jessica was aweful.. she didn't smile very much , she talked when she should have been checking up on her patrons at the bar, which the other waitress took care of because the bartender didn't.   My husband ate the bacon cheeseburger and I ate the chicken quesadillas which were great as far as food.  However because of the service we only gave her a $3.00 tip, and she changed it to an $8.00 tip which i will dispute in the morning.  She will hear from me in the morning in person, and it will not be nice. I don't like people that steal.  Be careful on giving tips on credit card.  give the tip in cash if you give any tip at all.  We are so furious at this issue.  We have never been treated like this at this bar .. once is enough."}
{"text":"Do not get the beer on tap here!! They're either not cleaning the lines or the lines need replaced, stale yuck, couldn't even finish it (yes, committed beer sacrilege.) The mixed drinks were very well done though. The most redeeming factor is the staff who are friendly and working well together to try to make it a good experience. Had the chicken Caesar and it was just ok. Chicken chunks were small and I had trouble finding them. Overall it was pretty lackluster. There's nothing else in this neighborhood unfortunately."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone that yelp needs to implement some half stars because this place isn't quite a 3 star, much more a 2.5.  Portions are pretty good sized and the food is decent. It tastes like every other american food restaurant you could go too and they dont put a special spin on anything. I loved our waitress and our bartender and they were super friendly and made us feel welcome, I just wasn't happy about spending $12 for some fish and chips that was a mediocre meal.  For being in a hotel its a good deal, and is definitely not something I'd tell anyone to avoid when they come in late from a flight or a long day at the office, I'm just saying get out into Phoenix and try some of the local favorites if you can. (Ask the hotel staff where the shuttle will take you!!)"}
{"text":"It's a casual and convenient eat if you're staying at the hotel. We were pretty hungry when we came in. I ordered fish tacos n my hubs got the steak nachos, asked for a side of sliced jalapenos n they brought us fresh ones, not the pickled stuff... it still made the nachos more interesting. Food wasn't spectacular but it's good n filling. Terri was very kind, offered to put our drinks in to-go cups so we could take to the room.  They've a nice bar and plenty of tables. I like the layout n the lighting, very chill."}
{"text":"Four stars for a hotel restaurant and bar? You might say it gets an extra star for convenience and service and it was a cut above what you usually find in and around airport hotels. We had the grilled salmon and we really liked it. Most people had drinks and sandwiches. We sat outside until it got too cold and watched planes land and enjoyed the sunset. Would not seek the restaurant out if I wasn't at the hotel but would definitely go back if in the area. The food was fresh and the place was clean and hospitable."}
{"text":"Rimrock Bar & Grille at the Phoenix Airport Hilton has the nicest staff. This is my third visit to this bar. It is my go-to place when I need to wait for someone at the airport. It is also my favorite place to eat Carne Asada nachos. The last time my daughter and I ate there, it was off the menu, but we were so happily surprised that it has made a come back. What makes this $15 dish so special? *delicious marinated steak *crunch tri-color chips *smooth and tasty guacamole *salsa on the side *fresh pico de gallo *sprinkling of black beans *pickled jalapenos available as per request *beautiful and well-balanced flavors *best deal on the menu (all items are priced similarly) Happy Hour is from 4-6 pm, discounts on wines and beer. What makes this place amazing is that they made room for our large 11-person party. When I noticed that there were no black beans on our first 2 orders of Carne Asada nachos, Teri, the manager comped us another order executed perfectly. They took care of us for several hours and were the perfect hosts to our family gathering. When we asked if we could play our favorite card game, they were welcoming and gracious. Thank you, Teri and Rimrock!"}
{"text":"All I can say about Rimrock Bar & Grille is that they make one hell of a great burger. We had just landed in Phoenix and we're staying at the Hilton Phoenix Airport location and we were so hungry because we skipped on eating Airline Food.   The only problem was that it was right before midnight when we checked in and the only dining option in the hotel was this place called Rimrock Bar & Grille which had a pretty good looking menu which consists of typical bar food.   It was ten minutes till midnight and as me and my wife walked in, I saw that look of terror on their faces as they were about to close up. I know the feeling of someone walking in right before closing to grab a bite to eat, but I was desperate so i had to have the courage to ask if they were still serving food and the bartender Lori was more than happy to honor our request which made me a very happy and hungry customer.   I was really craving for a Burger and what caught my eye was the Jett Lagged Burger$14.50 which was made with Applewood Smoked Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, and an Over Easy Egg. Being from Hawaii anything with an Over Easy on it is golden for me.   As for this Burger, let's just say I have eaten  Burgers all over the world, and this Burger has to be one of the Best Burgers I have ever eaten. What makes a great burger to me is the bun, and at Rimrock, the bun looked something like a Brioche Bun which perfectly sopped up all the juices from the Beef Patty and Over Easy Egg. The Burger was cooked to perfection and was amazing from the first bite to the last. If I ever stayed at the Phoenix Airport Hilton again, this would be the first thing I would order without a doubt.   I also ordered the Buffalo Chipotle Wings which was good but a little too spicy for my taste.   We also had the Strawberry Quinoa Salad which my wife said was a great tasting salad but a little too healthy for me.    Also, I had a Draught Beer which was perfect with my Burger but j forgot the name of it.   All I can say is that Jett Lagged Burger from Rimrock is something that is on my mind when I'm craving an amazing burger.."}
{"text":"I really would prefer to rate this restaurant a 2.5 but...  What is it that gives a bar, restaurant, etc. its vibe?  This bar is a bit dated and seems to be representative of what hotel bars were before they were swank.  Meaning, I almost expect \"two wild and crazy guys\" to come walking through the entry.  There were very few people in this bar and the music selection was HORRIBLE.  However, the bartender, Mark (I believe) from Minneapolis, was really terrific: a friendly guy who made certain that our glasses were always full."}
{"text":"We ordered a tuna melt, a Reuben and  2 chicken quesadillas. After a long drive and day of moving our kid out of his dorm, that meal was so good that we forgot to take pictures before we devoured it! Oops. But everything was good. HUGE portions of tater tots with my Reuben and sweet potato fries with the tuna melt. The service was really fast and our waiter Lee was very friendly and on top of it."}
{"text":"Okay, I am rating this place on the Hilton scale. I have spent hundreds and hundreds of nights at Hilton hotels and have had far too many evenings at the hotel restaurant/bar. This place is far above the average Hilton restaurant. Fairly interesting bar/hotel food with a little more extensive menu. Really nice and attentive staff."}
{"text":"A really good hotel bar. Our server Jamie was on it and recommended some good drinks and food. The drink they made up for Debbie was some kind of jalapeño margarita that had knob creek whiskey in it. Really nice. Then I got a beer flight. The Arizona beer is pretty darn good!  To eat we had steak tacos. For being so late this was really good. The meat was so tender and tasty. We were very impressed with this place. Good food, good service and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Tim from Chicago is awesome! Had the steak tacos . Great place ! Staff is friendly and helpful. Go here if you're staying in surrounding hotels."}
{"text":"OK I couldn't make up my mind when I saw the menu.  I had a hard time narrowing what I wanted down from 4 items to 1.  I ultimately ended up with the club sandwich and it was hearty and pretty tasty.  What I was really excited about was the tater tots.  They give you a butt ton of them and they are perfectly cooked.  Best tater tots.  In fact the tater tots were the driving force of picking the club for the meal.  So glad I made the right choice.  Zack gave good service and my glass of Rose' rounded out the meal. Tater tots with Rose' cause I'm classy like that."}
{"text":"The food here is a mediocre 2.5 stars at best. A lot of it was fried and while they do have a few salads and few special daily entrees the food was still sad overall. I had the Caesar Chicken wrap one night with underdone fries...it was OK. I also had the Chicken Primavera pasta which was actually tasty but needed way way more fresh veggies to make it somewhat healthy...they really skimped on the fresh ingredients here. Other than that the chicken strips, onion rings, fish filet and the like were all super fried. The chicken or veggie quesadilla were also OK but I'd just hop a cab anywhere for something a little fresher. The beer lines seemed stale here so I'd order the bottles or stick to cocktails which were made well. That aside the staff was all friendly and on top of things."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are horrible and the service doesn't make up for it. I came in around 9 and just got dessert and a drink. The Blueberry Rum Cooler was really just watered down fake lemon juice with 4 blueberries in it. I got the flan for dessert which claimed to come with \"light caramel and seasonal berries\" which apparently translates to swimming in caramel sauce with a single strawberry on the side. Also, my water glass was super dirty and I sat without being greeted for almost 10 min before being asked if anyone had been by. I'll be finding somewhere else outside of the hotel for breakfast tomorrow."}
{"text":"On a very busy night here I decided to stay in and eat at the Hilton. The steak tacos were excellent and \"just enough\" with the side of chips. The Margarita was refreshing and hit the spot.   The staff was very attentive and the manager made sure to stop by and make sure everything was good. Save yourself cab fare or driving out and eat here while you stay at the Hilton. Great place!"}
{"text":"To start off I would have to say I had an exceptional experience ! This is my first time ever rating a restaurant and I knew I had to rate this one! The waitress Lauri was kind and and did everything in a timely manner, which to me is immediately! My order was simple but a friends order was quite complicated ,The sous chef Lloyd Norton came out himself and personally made sure everything was great. He also cooked everything to perfection! He brought out the food and dessert himself and to me , this says he's not to busy to please the customer! LOVE LOVE LOVE this place"}
{"text":"I'm just going to grade this for what it is... A hotel bar in the middle of nowhere if you don't feel like taking a cab somewhere cooler.  I, for one, cannot stand being confined to my hotel room for hours.  I happened to be staying next door at the Courtyard and decided to go for a walk here to see if the scene was any more entertaining than the atmosphere there that can only be described as the result if Starbucks and a hospital decided they were going to combine thief boring forces to make a bar (if you're staying there, you know what I'm talking about).  Thus, I was excited as I wandered the hallways of the ugliest Hilton hotel I have ever seen to hear the chatter of men and women having a good time.  As i turned the corner, I was even more excited to find myself in a dimly lit sizable full bar with 6 flat screens in sight from my perch on a high bar stool as I write these run on sentences.  ;)  I'm not a hockey fan, but with no other sports in season, I'll take it.,  I'm not eating yet, but the menu looks like cheesy southwestern food - good enough if I pound a few more salty dogs from the friendly bartender.  Well worth the 100 yard walk from the Courtyard."}
{"text":"Along with Karri, I would give them 2.5 stars if I could.  I had a business lunch here the other day.  Time was limited and it made sense to grab lunch at the Hilton where several of the parties were staying.   I played it safe with a chicken quesadilla.  It was better than average for about 10 bucks.  It came with generous sides of guacamole and sour cream.  The service was good.  Prompt and efficient without being obtrusive.    Rimrock Bar & Grille is not a place I would ever seek out but safe and decent food for a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"Just as others have said I would really give this place 2.5 stars.  However I leaned more towards 2 than 3.  The establishment is located inside the Hilton by the airport.  I ordered the fried calamari which was over breaded and simply ok.  I also ordered a pint of Guinness.  There were only maybe 7-8 other ppl in the whole place yet when I finished my first pint i had to wait 10-min before I was asked if I wanted another.  And I was seated at the bar!!!  So food get's 2.5 stars, service gets 1.5 for an average of 2.  I didn't have a rental car and didn't feel like cabbin it even tho other joints were only 2 miles away.  Not having to leave the hotel counts for a lot!"}
{"text":"The restaurant within the hotel is a bit pricey and nothing to write home about.  We ordered the salmon which was pretty bland and the steak which had way too much fat on it, to the point it was almost inedible. The cheesecake though was delicious and the service was great. If your hungry and looking for something good to eat within the same price point about 15 minutes away I'd grab an uber and head over to Olive and Ivy's. It was quite honestly the best steak I've ever had.  And enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a typical hotel bar.  I wouldn't really call it a restaurant because it doesn't have any traditional restaurant tables to sit at. They only have small circular tables that you will find at a bar.  The food menu consists of typical American food of burgers and anything deep fried.  Want burritos and tacos, they have those too.  One good thing I liked was that they are on 4Square and if you check in you'll get a free dessert."}
