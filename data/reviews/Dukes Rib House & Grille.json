{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon (2:00). Bar was full; only three other tables were occupied. Place was dirty. We were there for an hour and two tables never got bust. Flies. Waitress was inexperienced and slow,  but nice. I got 1/2 rack and the wife got the pulled pork. Food was average at best. Slaw was room temp. I can overlook some sanatery issues IF the food is good. Not this place. No reason to go back; plenty of other places to go."}
{"text":"Appetizer (pretzel) was cold. Ribs were ok. Wrap was horrible. Fries were great. Stick to drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"Before coming here I checked the menu to see if they had any vegetarian options. Online the menu said the had \"veggie wrap\". When I arrived it was not on the menu but the waitress said they could make it for me. When it came out the forgot the fries. Then when I got the check they had charged me for the salmon wrap which was the most expensive wrap. It was a mediocre veggie wrap and not worth the money. Plus the waitress never came to refill our waters. I will not be returning or recommending the restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Good casual bar atmosphere,  The layout is a little goofy, I think the building was formerly a ski and sport store, but that does allow you find some privacy if you want.  Good sandwiches (try the Cuban, very nice), wings and ribs.  The bar area gets busy for Steelers, Pens, Pitt and WVU games.  Prices are typical for both food and drinks.  Service is good, great if they're not packing them in.  Nice big parking lot.

Surrounded by Scott Township and Mt. Lebanon, close to Green Tree, and Banksville Rd."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was ok, service was great.  Unfortunately the food was underwhelming.  Everything had the taste of \"big store/pre-prepared\".  The ribs were tasteless after you got past the bottled sauce; zero char on the meat or the sauce, so I assume it was just pulled out of a tray and sauced in spot.  Chicken was pre-cooked frozen.

Nothing had the grilled flavor I would expect out of a barbecue joint."}
{"text":"Big fan of Duke's. Great food, the wings are simple and tasty. Also, when asked about handicap accessibility, they rearranged their dining room to make my sister comfortable. A class act place with great food. We'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Had take out for four adults from here. The portions were sad. The food was cold. Fries were limp and soggy. Each item was in a separate oversized styrofoam container and worst of all, three of us were sick the next day. Epic fail."}
{"text":"First time here after having been recommended by a friend. Pretty interesting atmosphere with the split level bar and seating area. There is no shortage of flat screens to watch the game (Pirates vs Reds when we where there).

Started with the mini pierogie appetizer. They were good but could have used a side of sour cream. My wife got the pulled pork wrap and loved it.  

I ordered the half rack of ribs and 6 wing combo. Wings were ok. A little over done and not that much meat, though the Jerk Dry Rub was good. The ribs were awesome. Extremely tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Came during happy hour & appetizers were half price. My wife and I each had 10 wings & 1/4 rack of ribs. There were many flavor choices on wing sauce. Both the buffalo & honey bar b q were fantastic. The wings were cooked just right with a little crisp. The ribs were smothered in sauce & fell off the bone. I strongly recommend Duke's to you."}
{"text":"Great place to host a party. Food is typical bar food but not very expensive at all and the staff is very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan. Was here with a group of 4 for not just lunch, but drinks and then even dinner. We had a great waitress who kept us on our toes for Football beverages and the atmosphere was good.

It's definitely a great local bar to hang out for a game!"}
{"text":"Dukes is an awesome sports bar. Wings are good, d cent beer selection and real friendly staff. Good BBQ too."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Dukes rib house.   It is always crowded and the staff are always pleasant.

One of the better BBQ's in the area.   I enjoy the ribs (Capt Morgan Spiced Ribs) but my favorite item is the burgers.   I think they cook them on the same grill the ribs are done.

I  waiting like some other burger joints where they marry the pulled pork and burger - see flip daddy's review from Miami.  Awesome!

Sides are awesome too... Try the twice baked potatoes :)"}
{"text":"New to the area, as a previous bartender (4+ years) my expectations for good service are a bit higher than most.. First time here but surely not my last! Chelsea, the bartender has been awesome, food is delicious & some killer drink specials! If you're looking for a place to watch the game, grab some tasty grub, and throw back a few.. come on over! Can't wait for football season; they've got the Sunday NFL ticket!"}
{"text":"After Driving by Dukes for years, we finally stopped in, and we are glad we did. Immediately when you walk in you're hit with a slight stench of sour beer, giving you a bit of a nostalgic dive bar flashback. However, after your eyes adjust to the somewhat dark innards, you're greeted by a very uniquely 3 tiered restaurant. Which offers some delicious bar food and reasonably priced drinks. The beer on tap tasted a little like the lines need to be cleaned, but wasn't bad enough to send back, however, I did switch to bottles. As for the food, we started with boneless wings which were delicious, my Bacon Cheeseburger and sweet potato fries were very good, and my GF's steak sandwich with coleslaw was apparently awesome. She especially loved the coleslaw. I love Barbecue but am very cautious about ordering it at restaurants that don't primarily sell just BBQ. So I steered clear of their ribs, but someday might feel adventurous and give them a go. Overall, I would recommend Dukes, but somewhat cautiously. It leans more towards a dive bar, rather than fine dining. So if you're in the mood for something more refined, Dukes might not be for you."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great place to hang out and meet some friends, or just watch the game. The place is segmented into a main floor bar area and an open upper level on either side of the center. Very open and relaxed feeling. Good beer selection with about 10-15 taps and everything on the menu that I've tried has been great. The staff and owner are particularly friendly and helpful which scores big points. Great food, good drinks, good service, chill ambiance makes this an awesome spot. It's certainly not a nightclub, but it's my favorite spot in the area to have a bite or grab a drink - by far."}
{"text":"I had a great cut of steak here the other night with some awesome mashed potatoes. It was grilled and charred perfectly. Dessert was just ice cream with Oreo pieces in it. The service was fine, but the place is a little loud."}
{"text":"I've been to Duke's twice now for Meetups. This last time I was on a restrictive diet, so I want sure how great it would be. The server and the chef worked together to make substitutions fire all of my restricted foods with no trouble. And the server managed this while waiting on our party if 15!

I ended up with a delicious grilled salmon filet and steamed mixed veggies with a squeeze of lemon. It was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Sundays ago with my wife for dinner.  We had both been to Duke's before a long time ago but only for drinks.  So whenever we found it in the Enjoy book, we decided to give the food a try as well.  Whenever you first walk into Dukes you immediately enter into the bar area which has a bar and some high top tables.  Then much like a split level house, there are dining rooms both a half level down and a half level up from this area.  The bottom half (where we were seated) has a lot of exposed brick as well as some Pittsburgh sports memorabilia and some large TVs.

For dinner on this evening I decided to get the smothered chicken and chose sides of sweet potato fries and a side salad.  The side salad came out first and was your usual iceberg lettuce mix with red onions, cucumber and croutons.  It was an alright side salad but as you probably guessed with the mention of iceberg lettuce, somewhat tasteless as well.  Once my wife and I had both finished our salads our meals came out.  The first thing about my meal that I noticed was that it was garnished with a green leaf and an orange.  Wow talk about 80s garnish!  Honestly there isn't anything inherently wrong with that other than the fact that my green leaf was somewhat wilted and made for a not very appetizing appearance.  As for the rest of my meal, it looked good with the cheese, peppers and onions smothering the chicken.  However the chicken was maybe a half of a breast and I would have liked more of it.  Still it tasted pretty good as it had a grilled flavor to it and I enjoyed the cheese and toppings with it.  The sweet potato fries here were decent too and I liked that you were able to pick them as an option, even if they were a $1 up charge.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While nothing on my plate was amazing and I was a little disappointed with the portion size, it was a solid meal.  Perhaps my wife and I should give some of their ribs a go in the future since they do consider themselves a rib house."}
{"text":"Great food!! We go here about once a month as it is in our neighborhood. A great menu selection and everything is consistently cooked hot and perfect. We've never had any issues here. All the waitresses are nice and friendly. It can get loud in here with the music and voices rising (if you sit upstair) but it is a bar too so it's to be expected. Take out is also an option and that always worked out for us too. Burgers, flatbreads, all the apps, salads are all delicious and well worth the price! The wings are to die for and ribs are excellent also."}
{"text":"Definitely a place full of regulars, but it's not a bad thing. Great food, service is decent. Comfy atmosphere to watch a game."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food. A great sports bar if you're looking for a place for good beer and a casual environment."}
{"text":"Place is overpriced garbage.  Ordered a hot Totti  cause i had a sore throat.  7.50...2.50 for a tea bag?????  And 5.00 for bad whiskey. ..REALLY...."}
{"text":"First time last time....over an hour wait for dinner with about less than 20 people here and still no signs of getting served?! What the heck!"}
{"text":"Note: I'm assuming that Duke's Rib House & Grille is affiliated with Duke's Station in Bethel Park, which I've seen a bunch of times but have never been to. 

When you enter on a Friday night, you'll find that the atmosphere is a bit rambunctious. Jolly suburbanites, most of them middle-aged, will be whoopin' it up after a busy workweek. The place itself is rather grand and features cathedral ceilings, a fireplace, an aquarium, 4 levels, and a deck. It felt as if I was attending a party at a wealthy relative's cabin or weekend home. A 90's themed night must have been afoot being that the DJ stridently spun hits from Pearl Jam, The Spin Doctors, and The Black Crowes. 

I recall a fairish review written last year by The City Paper's Jason and Angelique of the Bethel Park Duke's, and because of that, I almost didn't bother despite being reminded of the Greentree location each time we've gone to the Giant Eagle in Virginia Manor Shoppes, but I'm glad Kay and I rolled the bones for I at least had myself one felonious bargain of a dinner. 

The Pork Sampler comes to your table on a platter that has surely served many meals with 2 sides of your choice (mine were a very good cole slaw and a baked potato), a half-rack of Kansas City-style BBQ ribs (Duke's signature menu item), baked beans (don't like 'em, never eat 'em), a mound of pulled pork, and a grilled pork chop, all for the staggering price of $16!

And aside from the baked beans (I have never acquired a taste for them), and a somewhat limp, overdone tuber, I appreciated the rite between vinegar and saccharin that was the crimson sauce. Topping the chop, pulled pork, and ribs, all of it unctuous, supple, and riddled with flavor, the sauce would perplex bees by attracting and repelling them with its union of sweetness and snap. 

The cole slaw was tangy, crisp, and coolly countered the zing and sugar of that sauce, therefore working well within the context of a BBQ meal.  

Their trio of unimaginative dessert offerings include an Oreo Hot Fudge Sundae, New York Cheesecake, and a Pecan Ball. Kay and I ganged up on the sundae and found that it was merely Oreo chunks, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream littered onto some scoops of vanilla ice cream. It was the sort of thing I'd throw together at home for myself and was nothing extraordinary. 

The service was nothing less and nothing more than competent. 

I have a feeling that BBQ dogmatists (that army of downers who think there's close to zero good eats in Pittsburgh, period, let alone BBQ)  may not enjoy Duke's offerings as much as I did, but I will stand by my review. 'Twas the stuff storied cookouts and picnics are made of. While the Max and Erma's next door may have gotten just as good a rating from me...well, you know I always root for the mom-n-pop bottom dogs, right?

P.S. As I alluded to earlier in the review, Duke's can be a bit loud, but bear in mind the time and day that we visited. It didn't bother me enough to reduce my rating, however, but I can see how some people might be put off by it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch.  Have driven by hundreds of times and ended up there because a friend said to met him at Dukes Station.  The bar and dining area were bright and very nice.  The waitress was very friendly and quick to seat us.  Service was very good.  My friend had the ribs and shared one with me, it was cooked perfectly so it was ready to come of the bone and the sauce was a nice sweet and tangy combo.  Had a pork sandwich that was very good with a nice sauce that also was sweet and tangy but not to sweet.  French fries came with the sandwich and were very good. Must have liked the fries, because kept eating them ever after I though I had finished."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here at least once a week for a few drinks and maybe an appetizer. The staff is very friendly, including the owner. The drinks are also reasonably priced. 

I've never gotten an entree from here, but the appetizers I've had were very good. I had the quesadillas with pulled pork, and the potato skins. Both were excellent. Fried zucchini was good too. 

The bartender named Toni is very friendly, she is usually there when my friends and I sit at the bar. 

Highly recommend this place for a chill night out with a few good friends. Relaxed atmosphere but not boring. Love coming here."}
{"text":"No one in the place under 30 and have the worst DJ ever playing club music. This place has potential, but is an embarrassment. The cliental could have done a better job with the juke box.  Crappy DJ hasn't played a single song I have ever heard. And the crowd isn't even reacting to the music. Pitt game is on now and its on 2 TVs out of 20.  Baseball playoffs is in the 14th inning and its on 1 TV. They prefer to play the UNLV vs San Jose St game that is a blowout and no one cares about. Plus all girls here are built like bowling pins."}
{"text":"Great ambience, Right place to have drinks and food. Employees are awesome and the service is excellent..!! You can have lot of fun and excitement when you are watching any sport..!! They have lot of great deals on their drinks and food..!!!"}
