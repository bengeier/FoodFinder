{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a recent friday and were not overly pleased; a mixed review on both food and service.  

Food: Soup and a side caesar salad were really excellent.  The crusty bread was great.  Wine pairings were good.  The second, pasta course, came and one dish, a bolognese, despite having over-cooked pasta, was exactly traditional and as it should be in every way.  The pasta carbonara, however, was not so good - the eggs had nearly completely scrambled and were separate from the cheese - versus having formed the basis of the traditional, silky, smooth sauce.  

Service: Our server was really polite, knowledgeable about the menu and wine list and professional and apologetic when the food problems came up.  However, my dining companion and I joked that our number one recommendation to the management here would be to hire a \"second server\" as she was almost completely absent from our table - we assumed busy elsewhere!  The front door hostess at one point was serving bread and olive oil.

When an expensive italian restaurant serves me overcooked pasta and a carbonara that is a simple failure - making me wait, pushing my patience while so doing I know something's wrong."}
{"text":"Not worth the money!  Beautiful restaurant & atmosphere.  That's where it stopped.  Since our foursome had decided on an early dinner to accommodate our schedule, we were the only customers when we arrived.  A few additional table were seated while we were there.  For as empty as the restaurant was, the service was horrible.  We had to ask for our own bread, dinners were served cold and our server did not pay attention to our table. Our intention was to send 2 of the 4 meals back but there was no one within earshot to handle the poor quality of food.  Way over priced for what we received.
Conversely, we observed the stellar service a different server gave to a nearby table of about 8 people.  She handled the large group with greater respect and attentiveness than our small group received.  This will be our last return trip."}
{"text":"As a former Clevelander living on the West Coast, I only come home about once a year and don't really keep up with the Cleveland restaurant scene. I was pleasantly surprised by MichaelAngelo's.  I started the evening with a drink at the bar, which was a larger space, but warm and inviting, perfect for a cold winter evening in Cleveland.  From the bar, we moved onto dinner.  For our first course, my friends ordered the tomato bisque soup, smoky in flavor with a hint of cream.  Simple, yet delicious - one of the best tomato bisque soups I've ever had.  I also had the bibb lettuce salad, a good basic salad with a light vinegarette dressing. The kobe beef carpaccio was again simply prepared, but delicious.  For dinner, we had several pastas; I highly recommend the wild boar tortelloni in a reduction sauce. The boar was very good, but did not overpower the dish.  The gnocchi was excellent!  Served in a hazelnut pesto sauce, these gnocchi were light as a pillow.  By far, this was the best gnocchi I've ever had. To compliment our main courses, we had a \"super Tuscan\" meritage that was excellent, a recommendation from John, the manager.  It was hard to choose a dessert, but we ended the evening with a chocolate carmel tart. Yum. Overall, it was a great experience -- the staff was extremely attentive, great wine list and delicious food.  I will definitely go back to MichaelAngelo's next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and when I got there to pick it up in 40 minutes it wasn't even started. Ended up waiting for another 40 minutes. On top of everything waitress was super rude. Oh, they were not even busy! I use to like this place but I will never go back. So many great restaurants in that area."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I've had in cleveland. The risotto was mind-bendingly good. 

Will go back as soon as we have something to celebrate."}
{"text":"The server never paid us any attention.She always stayed in the bar area, as she could earn more tips there.Will never come back here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice but a bit noisy. The dining room is small and intimate with low lighting and cloth covered tables. However this smallness does make it a bit loud when music is playing and other tables are talking.
The service is a bit uneven...in such a small setting with very little turnover you would expect better service. Our waitress was forgetful and a bit scattered, which meant our meals took awhile and items were not delivered and had to be reordered.
The food...is good. But if you have special dietary needs ask questions! There are no items listed that are vegetarian or vegan, everything contains meat or fish. Be sure to ask your server about adjustments."}
{"text":"I also am surprised at some of the bad reviews, they must have been having an off night on those nights!  I went with a group after work and felt the atmosphere was perfect, the food was ridiculously good (had half portions of both the lobster ravioli and sacchetti al tartufo), the wine was delicious and the service was reasonable.  I am almost afraid to go back because I loved it so much and am worried it won't live up to those expectations again after reading some of the other reviews... but I have a reservation for this Friday so I'll update my review then if needed!"}
{"text":"Outstanding, authentic Italian food. Atmosphere was nice, low lighting but not too dim. Waiter was very knowledgeable with the menu and wines. I have a wheat intolerance and the chef was able to make adjustments to my meal and it was still lovely. A good app to try was the calamari, it was mouth watering. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was that the waiter left us waiting at several points during the meal for him to return to refill drinks and bring us the bill. Would recommend for a fancy date, company dinner, special occasions."}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see Michaelangelo's has only 3.5 stars on Yelp. I am a regular here, with my parents and brother. We have a lot of experience with fine dining from around the country and Michaelangelo's impresses us every time. Exquisite Italian food and we love the staff here, too. No idea where these bad reviews are coming from. 

Thanks, everyone at Michaelangelo's! We appreciate you!

{"text":"If you go to this restaurant, I'd recommend skipping the appetizers, because they aren't much food. If you come here and go straight to the main course, you will most likely really like it. 

I ate the salmon, which was absolutely phenomenal, perfectly cooked, and just the right amount of food. 

The staff seemed a little bit stressed out, but it didn't bother me, because they were responsive, and the atmosphere of the restaurant, along with the mostly brilliant menu was great! My only complaint was the over priced appetizers."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food. Actually thought their red sauce was delicious, which being Italian I am tough on. Cavatelli dish was great. 

Service was prompt and friendly....no complaints. 

Will definitely go back when in LI."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday evening with a party of about 10.  We were kind of crammed into our table, which was a little disappointing, especially because the restaurant was not full until we were leaving.

Service and wine were excellent.  My salad with strawberries was delicious.  However, my main course of chicken saltimbocca was not good.  The creamy sauce was bland, giving me a cafeteria food impression.  The potatoes in the dish were undercooked, and the chicken was dry.  

Espresso was good.  I may come back here and try something else, but based on the fact that no one at the table said \"Oh my, this is so good,\" I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Great service. Food nicely presented. Half size pasta portions are good size and well priced. Valet parking right in front of restaurant is nice"}
{"text":"Good eats+ good service + better company = perfection

This review is long overdue, as the Mister and I treated ourselves to a nice dinner for Valentine's Day this past year. Better late than never, right?

We decided to try a spot that has been on my list for AGES. Michaelangelo's, a fine establishment just across the street from us, has received rave reviews since it opened its doors in 2006. In fact, last year the restaurant was Zagat Rated!

Review highlights:

This romantic retreat offers authentic Northern Italian Cuisine from chef/co-owner Michael Annandoro, along with an extensive selection of wines and a stylish bar area. With a large fireplace for winter and a patio for warmer weather, its an ideal choice for a special night out.

We started with the house multi-grain bread and flavored olive oil.

We ordered our \"go-to\" Italian appetizer, which is normally any dish that includes mozzarella and prosciutto. As soon as we spotted the \"Bufala,\" we knew we had to have it. Described on the menu as buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto di parma and roasted red peppers, this dish was the perfect way to kick off our dinner. The mozzarella was rich, creamy and a great match for the salty prosciutto.

Knowing that I'd be ordering an indulgent treat, I thought it would be best to order something light. But light and healthy doesn't mean flavorless - NO SIREE. This simple arugula salad was packed with incredible flavors! I loved the rich quality of the olive oil and the lemon was such a refreshing touch. The salad contained minced garlic and onion, as well as salty, savory Parmesan cheese. The Mister stole a few bites and proclaimed it to be one of the best salads he's ever tasted (Joey's Ceasar Salad in Chagrin Falls in also on the list).

For my \"dinner\" I ordered the Minestrone soup. Without a doubt, this was one of the heartiest Minestrones I've ever had. This thing was chock-full of root vegetables and beans -- so filling! It had quite a kick, too (luckily my whimpy taste buds could handle it, though!).

The Mister was kind enough to let me pick from all the decadent dessert offerings. In addition to the standard menu, the server explained some of the Valentine's Day features. I heard the words \"chocolate bomb\" and was sold. The chocolate coating contained rich and creamy chocolate mousse - like a little present from the chocolate Gods! While some chocolate dishes can be too rich and quickly weigh you down, this was the perfect balance. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

The Mister and I decided that we'll be heading back to Michaelangelo's very soon. But this time we BOTH plan on ordering soup and salad  - that way we'll have room for an extra dessert!

This was such a great evening! The ambiance of the restaurant was very romantic and I loved every minute of chatting with the Mister and enjoying his company. Let's face it, Valentine's Day dinners have a pretty bad rep. From noisy and over-crowded restaurants, to poor service and cold food, I've heard all the horror stories. But if anything, Michaelangelo's went above and beyond to make sure our dining experience was special. Our waiter was so helpful and attentive and we never felt rushed. Make sure you give Michaelangelo's a try for your next special occasion -- they'll make sure you leave with some great memories"}
{"text":"Food was just okay. That is not the feeling you want to walk away after dropping the kind of $ here that you inevitably will. The wine list was impressive and our bottle of wine was by far my favorite part of dining here. The waiter was knowledgeable and kind, but again, the food was sadly bland for all the hype it received. If you are going to charge those kind of prices, it should be top notch."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite restaurants to visit when in Cleveland! Great food, atmosphere, and service---in particular my waitress Amanda, without fail, always provides the most exceptional service I have ever received! In fact, after 3 months of not having to travel to the area for business, she remembered me when I visited the restaurant this time and gave such a warm welcome-including remembering the exact wine I always have there! All of which makes for the best well rounded service bear University Circle!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Little Italy.  The lobster ravioli is absolutely delicious!  My husband always orders the filet; it's so
Tender, a knife isn't needed.  With an appetizer, salad, entree, dessert and a bottle of wine, our check came to $235.  I wish wine was available by-the-glass in the dining room."}
{"text":"An evening at Michaelangelo's is really special!

We went there a couple of weeks ago, and just felt as though all the staff bent over backwards to take care of us. The hostess took out coats; then another person seated us and asked - get this - if we would like black napkins instead of white to go with out dark clothes. What?!?

Then another woman came over to inquire if we wanted sparkling, bottled still, or tap water.

Then our actual waitress came out and rattled off the specials. They all sounded amazing. We went for the calamari appetizer (sauteed, not fried) and the ribollita (Tuscan vegetable soup). Delicious.

For our main course, we wanted to try some of the homemade pasta on the menu. There was a note that said \"half-sizes available,\" which the waitress mentioned could also be used to mix and match orders. Great! We each decided to get two half-orders of pasta. I went with the veal & cheese tortellini and the tomato-basil cavatelli. My husband opted for the lobster ravioli and the gnocchi pesto. 

When they were brought out, we thought they got the order wrong - EACH dish looked like a full size! But nope, they were half. I'll know for next time, because it was almost embarrassing how much food was there. I recently visited another Italian restaurant downtown where the half-sizes of pasta were truly like half-sizes. This was more like 3/4 sized, or just plain full-sized.

The pasta was outstanding. Our favorites were tortellini, which had this amazing cream sauce, and the gnocchi. My husband loved the lobster ravioli - I didn't as much. The cavatelli was pretty standard and didn't have a tremendous amount of flavor, although the chunks of fresh mozzarella on top were a nice touch.

Dessert was tiramisu...mmmm. And they had great coffee too (even though I had decaf).

All in all, a great restaurant in a tucked-away location for a special occasion only! (Did I mention we had to use valet parking? Ughhh!) They also have a nice patio area outside (which nobody was using because it was chilly).  On the way out, we passed the cozy, lounge/bar area with leather couches, a fireplace, and of course, sports on the TV.  This would be a perfect place to take your old-school, but slightly classy, parents on a visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"If there were 0 stars if be ok with that. Cold eggplant appetizer with mozzarella that had clearly been nuked several minutes earlier. The spinach salad was fine. My black squid ink pasta with seafood was an amazing display of bleached old seafood and rubbery scallops. So gross. My husband's drink with the hot pink lipstick on the glass was really outstanding. This is right up there with the worst C rated restaurants in NY. Stay away if you value your taste buds and internal organs."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Strong service. Very good but not exceptional food based on what I had tonight. I had the Ossobuco, which is a signature dish. It comes with a risotto and a fried spinach. It was solid but I wish I would have had something else. Late in the meal I asked for some grated Parmesan.  This definitely helped as the risotto lacked some flavor. By no means a bad dish but not exceptional IMO.  

I had the $12 caprese, which was very underwhelming with three mediocre slices of an heirloom tomato with basil and a decent fresh mozzarella.  It looked better than it tasted and could have used some balsamic to bring more flavor. 

My wife had the chanterelle mushroom soup, which is very rich but absolutely fantastic. Best mushroom soup I have ever tasted. A little heavy on the chive oil. 

I will try it again but next time will get the beet salad if they have it and try a straight pasta dish."}
{"text":"Michaelangelo's is a great pre-Orchestra spot. 

Half orders are fairly priced and sized. An escargot appetizer that I shared with another person and 3/4 of the half plate of Lobster Ravioli was enough to fill me up (along with who knows how many slices of the complementary bread..)

Other members of the group ordered calamari, the Bolognese, and the Veal Ravioli. All were pleased with their meal although one of the guys realized he definitely would have been filled up on the half order.

Fairly priced with good food in Little Italy in an intimate setting."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Michaelangelo's for a Valentines Day dinner. The atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Not too loud and tables that were well spaced. We both ended up getting specials as the menu presented some interesting options for Italian fare that neither of us found overly appealing. The service was phenomenal without being the least bit stuffy. Our deserts were very good as well. With a couple more staple Itslian dishes this is a four or five star."}
{"text":"First time here and had a \"Top Ten\" of my lifetime meal!   From my lobster asparagus bisque to the osso bucco with Parmesan truffle risotto to the Italian coffee gelato, everything was PHENOMENAL.  My husband meal was every bit as good as mine.   He was a huge fan of the Limoncello cheesecake for sure!  Great portions, good wine list and excellent cocktails as well.   Our lovely waiter was even kind enough to serve us our desserts by the fireplace in the lounge area, so cozy and romantic.  We will be back for certain!"}
{"text":"After a brisk 20' walk from the Intercontinental, entering this warm & cosy haven was a pleasure. Very friendly maitresse d' greeted us, took our coats & directed us to the bar, saying our table would be ready 10' after our reservation time. Bartender was exceptionally helpful despite being very busy & we ended up selecting a 2007 Col di sole Brunello di Montalcino (www.rjonwine.com/italian-wine/brunello-di-montalcino/) after it turned out they didn't have the 2007 La Gerla. Fairly standard ~80% markup, but a very enjoyable wine. 

We returned to the front desk 30' after our reservation time to remind them, & were immediately shown to our table. Excellent bresaola, burrata & eggplant caponata & delicious half-order of lobster ravioli were perfect starters. We were disappointed they had run out of osso buco (mentioned by other reviewers previously), but the veal scallopine & duck breast were delicious (both maybe just a tiny bit longer on the fire than we ideally prefer, & the plates might've been warmed a bit more, but it was a busy night). We couldn't finish the accompanying risotto cake & farro, respectively, & only had room to split a panna cotta, which unfortunately had too much gelatin & too-firm & starchy texture. 

But overall, a very enjoyable meal in a nice space, with friendly staff. Other reviewers mentioned the tables being too close together & the price being a bit high, but we found both acceptable, ?possibly because we're from the Bay area..."}
{"text":"Like boring, overpriced, bland Italian food?  Well look no further!  The veal was drier than the Mojave Desert.  The calamari was alright.  The escargot was passable (but French style is tastier).  They definitely had a well stocked bar full of Italian treats and the desserts were great but  overall I wasn't really impressed.  Better food at Buca, the Old Spaghetti Factory, Frankie's, and Peppino's.  Plus the wait there is way too damn long for the quality of food they serve.  I won't be going back to Michaelangelo's anytime soon."}
{"text":"We had a goodbye lunch here for a colleague, and the general consensus was that everything was very good, but not out of this world.  The ambiance at the bar is unique, and cool.  The pastas were very good, and the salads were very good."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night with 7:30 reservations and it was not full but we still had to park on the street and walk. I've eaten everywhere from California, to Vegas, to Miami. And the food here is EXCELLENT. It's a smaller restaurant, but not stuffed. Excellent wine list. They also had Booker's whiskey which is a rare surprise. We had the Calamari app, and the Steamed clams appetizer. Both were good, above average, but not the best ever. My house salad was a Mesclun mix in a shaved cucumber ring with a great balsamic. First time ever and it was great. We had the lobster ravioli which was great. The spicy cavetelli which was excellent. and the pasta with giant prawns, tomatoes, in garlic Aoli was the dish of the night. Perfectly balanced. Creme Brulee was double the size of average desert.  After dinner we sat at the nice wooden bar with stone fireplace and watched the Cavs game. 

Drinks and dinner was VERY expensive. Too expensive, thus the minus 1 star. Service was excellent. At those prices, you have to be paying for a location or a view, or something. But this didn't have those. But overall, it's my front runner for meal of the year so far."}
{"text":"Our dinner club went to Michaelangelo's with very high hopes. We made reservations at least 2 weeks out for 15 (only 10 were able to make it) and we were given a private dining room for a 7:15 reservation. The ambiance was wonderful and we had a great interaction with the bartender while waiting for the rest of the party to arrive. 

Once seated, it took 20 minutes before we were able to place the order. Between the 10 of us we had a range of hot and cold appetizers, salads and entrées. The salads came out promptly, but noticed the appetizers, which we said to bring all at once, were delayed. Apparently, the kitchen has a standing rule of 30 min between each course. By 9, we did not have entrées and some of the party began requesting bills and to-go boxes. My entrée arrived and it looked great - risotto and pork shank. The meat was very tender and falling off the bone, however had no flavor. The risotto was watery and bland. My husband's Osso Buco looked very unattractive and was very disappointing for a $40 dish. 

One of the members of our group went to discuss the timing with the manager and he proceeded to tell her to expect a 2 hour dinner (we were closer to 3 at this point) and basically that we were wrong for having different expectations. The server treated us very rudely from that point on. When the reservation was made, it was clarified with the manager that we would have split checks and all pay with cash. The server seemed to know nothing about this and when trying to split the bill told me she would come back when we \"got it figured out\" and stormed out of the dining room. By the time we paid the bill it was 10:30.

Long story short - we planned ahead, they did not. We had a 3.5 hour sub-par dinner that did not include dessert or coffee, one of the greatest parts of an Italian restaurant. There are so many great places in Little Italy that I wish we had visited instead."}
{"text":"Get the duck....or any of the fish....ossobuco. or pretty much anything there. Have had many. Enjoy it all with some good wines."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  

Italian in little Italy with a reserved, elegant ambiance, and a decent wine menu.  The decor is modern with red hues and dark tones.  Had a number of appetizers and two pastas with a friend, and we were reasonably happy with the meal.

Portions were large and service reasonably prompt and knowledgable."}
{"text":"My friend and I met his cousin here for dinner when we were in Cleveland, and we all had a lovely time here! The layout, the service, and the food were absolutely astounding. I had the lobster ravioli, which was out of this world, and they both had veal risotto. No complaints from them, as they both seemed to enjoy their filling dish! I can also recommend the escargot, which also had an amazing sauce too! Definitely a must if you go to Cleveland's Little Italy! It's a bit pricier for a dish, but definitely worth it in the quality and service you get in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the best upscale Italian restaurants I have been to! Very cozy decor and great seating. Also, a large parking lot in back so parking is not an issue.

Every dish was amazing, especially the Black Truffle Sacchetti. The pastas are homemade and sauces have incredible delicate flavors. The calamari appetizer is served in a tomato broth, so be sure to ask for extra bread! The wait staff was attentive and friendly. 

Prices are extremely reasonable for what you get- a half order of pasta runs about $15. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Subpar service and adequate food for excessive prices. Our server was respectful of our dietary needs, but after we ordered, there was no sign of her until 45 minutes later when our food was delivered. Another server brought us bread about 20 minutes after ordering, but it was so burnt that it wasn't worth eating. When the food finally arrived, my sisters gluten-free meal was nowhere to be seen. She waited an additional 15 minutes for her food and received no apology regarding the extreme wait time. After all of this, her gluten free pasta wasn't even cooked, but it wasn't worth the hour wait to get it fixed. Overall, considering the price point, we felt the service to be a disappointment."}
{"text":"Wife and I had dinner at Michaelangelo's May 31, 2018.   We started with a spinach salad and mussels.  The spinach salad was ok but the pancetta somehow made it way too salty.  The mussels were in a bland tomato sauce and we were disappointed with that dish.  The Lobster Ravioli was great with large firm chunks of lobster.  The pappardelle bolognaise was fantastic.  All in all we were quite pleased even though the appetizers weren't all that great.  Part of the reason we enjoyed our meal so much is that we had told the waiter that we wanted to share the dishes and he brought us extra plates so we could do that easily.  
Also, the main courses we had were offered in full and half portions.  We found that the half portions were quite adequate for us.  

Overall, we were quite pleased and plan to return."}
{"text":"Entirely forgettable and hugely overrated \"heavy\" Italian. Lobster Claw Martini arrived with hidden shards of shell mixed in and was otherwise soupy and bland. Pappardelle Bolognese was denser than a black hole -- pasta was unremarkable and sauce was bland enough to be served at the nearby retirement home. 

Sorry, but just because the restaurant is in Little Italy doesn't mean it gets a pass on Italian cooking."}
{"text":"Wow!  Excellent wine list.  Excellent pasta.  Had the Pappardelle with Barolo Ragu.  Would definitely come back here.  In fact we are coming back in two nights."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that I've lived in greater Cleveland my whole life and have passed Michaelangelo's on countless occasions, yet I had never paid them a visit until recently. Needless to say, I'm quite glad that I did! This fine establishment embodies the art of elegance and accentuates the standards for fine dining! The menu is varied of Northern Italian fare, which is abundant in quality choices that vary from minestrone to meat dishes, all of which are expertly prepared and taste decadent. The food is a slight departure from the standard southern Italian fare that is more abundant in Cleveland.

The wine list is expansive in selection and offers reds and whites from every corner of the globe.  Even more impressive is the fact that complimentary fresh baked bread is brought to the table with an olive oil tapenade that pairs perfectly. Lastly, for desert you can't leave without enjoying a tempting square of tiramisu - it's heaven on a plate! While the prices here are a bit on the high end, the quality and ample portion sizes make it well-worth the money spent. At Michaelangelo's you truly do get what you pay for, and then some."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see that this restaurant only has 3.5 stars. I went here for dinner for the first time recently and was not only impressed by the ambiance, but also the menu selection and friendly service. This place is a bit upscale; therefore, pricey as well, but I thought it was well worth it. I had the raviolini de aragosta, which was honestly the best ravioli I've had to date. I remember that the sauce was sweet and well seasoned, and I appreciated the pieces of lobster claw that were thrown right into the sauce in addition to being baked into the ravioli. I would have loved to try any one of the dishes I saw at my table and at the tables around me. Desert is highly recommended; the gelato was delicious."}
{"text":"I want to first say in this review if you had a subpar time or no experience in the fine dinning industry, I'll direct you to the nearest Olive Garden. At first sight, my reaction of the deacor? Lovely. The staff was very knowledgeable and professional individuals, some better than others probably because of tenure But solid altogether. Best thing on the menu either the lobster ravioli or if you would like to spend a little extra and be a man, the occobucco and saccheiti are out of this world."}
{"text":"I do not know why this restaurant has mixed reviews. To me, it is the closest to what was served to us in Italy. The food was flavorful, organic, fresh and with a notably toned down acidic note. You'll know it's the real deal when they serve calamari 'naked'. 

I love \"Italian\" as well as \"Italian-American\", but both are different. Michaelangelo's represents the former more than the latter."}
{"text":"We are trying as many restaurants as possible in Little Italy and I can report that so far Michelangelo's is my favorite. It's an unassuming location that is tucked away and easy to miss. Make the effort to come here and you will be rewarded with the best Italian fare that Cleveland has to offer. We had the eggplant terrine appetizer and calamari appetizer which were both excellent. My wife then had the lobster ravioli which she claimed was perhaps the best ravioli ever as it had giant pieces of lobster throughout!  I went with the bolognese with veal and guinea foul which isn't something I wild usually order but I wasn't disappointed either. My only regret is that we didn't have time to relax in the bar which looked really cool. I'll hit that up on my next visit which I'm sure won't be too long from now!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had just arrived in Cleveland and were getting oriented and we decided to learn the RTA and took the train to Euclid/120th Street. It was also our first meal in Cleveland. We walked thru Little Italy which was very nice but we initially could not find the restaurant [we had not walked down far enough] We felt if nothing else we had to find it so after asking directions, we did find it and they opened for dinner. We were seated immediately by Gabby and got drinks and our orders taken. I got the black linguine with seafood which was delicious. My friend's meal was also very good. They came around with bread constantly [a big plus] and were very attentive. It was a wonderful meal and would recommend and return."}
{"text":"I Brought my family to little Italy for dinner since we're from Nj/NY and we go to little Italy in NY all the time. We Came for early dinner around 5:30 pm. We sat outside and it was wonderful.  Our waitress Crystal was amazing, attentive and was extremely friendly. Our server Andrew was great as well! Every dish was delicious, tasty and fresh. I highly recommend this restaurant. I attached photos of our dishes. The tuna tar tar was great. We also ordered the paperdalle with bolognese, osso bucco, and the lobster ravioli. I highly recommend that you come here !"}
{"text":"What a sad disappointment!! Michaelangelo's used to be reliably excellent, but our experience tonight was at best mediocre at best. The spinach salad was served without pancetta or walnuts - just a bunch of spinach leaves with a measly quartered strawberry. We complained and they added the ingredients described in the menu, but it was a harbinger of further disappointments. The bolognese sauce, which used to be outstanding, was tonight a uno-dimensional, heavy tomato sauce with no subtlety or artistry to it.  The veal in the saltimbocca was tough and overcooked - a very common problem, but inexcusable for a restaurant of this caliber. Alas, no longer. We cannot rely on Michaelangelo's excellence any more."}
{"text":"I was in from out of town visiting family, had been looking forward to restaurant based on majority of reviews. I was informed AFTER our drinks had been brought that they were out of both the Osso Bucco as well as the veal canelloni. This was 7:30pm on a Sunday. I ended up ordering my default in this instance a steak which was cooked well, but I hadn't really wanted a steak at an Italian restaurant. Based on the other dinners that came, the shrimp in the sauce on the lobster ravioli did not taste or smell very fresh, the remaining dishes were overall average. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great and I won't be returning. If you decide to go I would recommend calling in advance to be sure EVERYTHING is available."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!!!! Wow, THE best pasta I have ever had. I got some sort of lobster, creamy tomato pasta and it was delicious, well worth the price. But, it took about an hour and a half for it to come out. Idk if it was because of how big of a table we had (table of 11) but we waited a long long time for the food. Other than that everything was phenomenal"}
{"text":"This one's gonna be tough... When you pay 3-digits for a meal, you're paying for more than what's just on the plate but the plate itself and everything between it and the parking lot!  So I write this taking the whole experience in - service and ambience apply. 

Checked out the menu, made reservations, and my wife and I arrived expecting a romantic dining experience.

Food was damn good, period.  Although they ran out of Osso Buco and Paparadelle - not good.  I wasn't too happy about \"running out\" of dishes (plural!) at a place that takes reservations...

Service?  Waitress was nice n' all - but she didn't exude the professionalism I expect from a place trying to take on such a classy tone.  For example, she didn't know the menu all too well and had to run in a couple of times to answer basic questions about what accompanied the entrees (i.e. pasta or rice? veggies?).  Some of the comments she made, I hate to say it but she fit more in a diner than a classy joint. (She mentioned she was a short-timer anyway...)  Not a good mood-setter.

Outside surroundings aren't the best - the site and sound of hospital support machines accompany you from the parking lot to the front door and can be seen through the windows from the dining room.  Might seem petty, especially since I wouldn't care at a diner or fast food joint.  Again, judging it wholly on being a 3-digit meal experience, it just wasn't a good mood-setter.

So I need to judge it on the whole experience.  Food?  100% for what we got.  But it's the little things that pulled it down from a 5-star experience for me.  If it wasn't for the food, I'd give it a 3-star experience.  So bottom line, would I go here again?  Yyyyyyeah, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised people do not love Michaelangelo's.  The food here is simply excellent.  The portions are huge, and amply delicious too.  I ordered a half portion of the pasta which was more than enough-and with me saying that you know I can eat!  I loved the spinach salad and their chocolates for dessert were excellent.  

I recommend that anyone who did not love it come back and give it another try.  I find this place so quaint its simply lovable."}
{"text":"The bread our group was served before dinner sadly was the best part of the experience.
Appetizers were a joke. Amongst other things they consisted of mortadella and canned bell peppers with an extra and very unnecessary olive oil drizzle. 
Hardly anybody finished their entrees - ravioli with not even molten cheese in them, bland and unrecognizably tasting fish, bland chicken. Only the people who ordered beef were happy with their dish. 
The wine selection is small and our waiter was not good at giving recommendations. 

Just because you host a CE course and it is pre paid and because the guests most likely won't be sending their dishes  back because they're not picking up the bill - don't serve food that resembles air plane food.  With an excessive olive oil drizzle."}
{"text":"Truly average Food.  I wont even call it real Italian cuisine.  I just came from Quartino's in Chicago which puts Michaelangelos to shame.  Superb authentic Italian meal at 1/2 the cost that this place charges.  They try and mask it with a fancy atmosphere, but the food quality just isn't there.  The Pappardelle Bolognese was sadly bland, no fresh flavor, and had a Chef Boyardee taste to it. I thought I could salvage the meal with the  \"home made Gelato\".  This was a joke when it comes to gelato.  It was flavorless frozen cream with a texture of ice crystals.  Chef needs to take a trip to Chicago and dine in some real Italian restaurants there."}
{"text":"I am shocked this place is not ranked higher!! We just went here last night for a celebration and it was out of this world. 
The decor is cozy and beautiful. The bar has a roaring fire and a feeling of warmth and welcome! 
The wine list is perfect with plenty of choices from very high end to \"normal\" restaurant wines. 
The menu is extensive with a variety of choices. I had the duck which was outstanding. It was cooked perfectly with a big portion! My friends got gnocchi, cavatelli , and veal.  Every one raved about their food!! Everything was outstanding. 
Moving on to service.. It was the perfect amount of attention! No one was over bearing or absent! It was like our server knew our needs before we needed it! 
I applaud this gorgeous restaurant for a perfect evening!!!"}
{"text":"Our party of 9 on a prime night was seated on time. Everything was perfect with exceptions below. I appreciate that the place is easily wheelchair accessible (my last two experiences at other Little Italy restaurants lied out right about this). Food was awesome... the braised veal shanks shines in my memory 4 days later.

This is my fourth time there and it is consistently good, with trying a different dish each time. 

I just wish they would go beyond average on the deserts... this held me back on the 5th star. As well as the server. She was knowledge but very curt and had a habit of finishing your sentences and also talking over you when asking a question. She was very blunt when interrupting us to take orders. A little less force and a smile or two, would go a long way. We all shot glances at each other because we were dumbfounded by her attitude, considering what our bill was going to be with drinks, apps, entrees, bottles of wine and desert for 9. Hope it was just an off night for her."}
{"text":"Wine selection is impressive for Cleveland. Lots of great Italian wines. ( of course ) but also great ones from Napa.  Portions are large and prices are fair for what you get.  
I give it a 3 star review because of the server.  The server was a bit rude.  Didn't smile at all, no please, thank you, etc.  When my mom, took a soup spoon from another diner for her soup, the server immediately took it and put it back in it's \"proper place\" and got another spoon for my mom.  Totally unnecessary. 
 Living in the Ja Jolla /Del Mar area of San Diego there are plenty of high class restaurants and the servers don't act like that.  She could have made the afternoon really nice for my family but even though the food was great, she put a real damper on the afternoon.   Not sure I would return. 
Note: I checked the box \"not good for kids\".  However if your kids are well behaved and you don't mind paying for the food, they would be fine.  I would have taken my kids when they were younger b/c they appreciate good food and will sit nicely.  Definitely not a place if your kids like to run around as its a pretty small dining room."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. We were desperate for a table when our reservations fell through across the street before the orchestra concert. 8 of us piled in the bar area and ended up having a fantastic experience.
The bar area was cozy with the fireplace and big leather chairs. The bartender was more than accommodating, taking care of all of us while managing the rest of the restaurants drinks, including a wedding that was in the back room.
And the food was fantastic. I ordered the tortellini with mushrooms (i forget the very Italian name of the dish) and my husband had the Osso Bucco, which he said was the best he's ever had. The servings were large and we still cleaned our plates. I'm still thinking about the Super Tuscan red wine we had too.
THANK YOU for saving our night, Michaelangelo's, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place gets an A+ in my book. The food is phenomenal and the waitress was great. The little boy who took us to our seats, handed out menus and asked how our food was, is about as cute as it gets! What a special touch. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) great Italian food
2) gluten free friendly
3) super nice and accommodating staff

I do not have enough good things to say!

I met a groups of friends at michaelangelos on a Friday night and was immediately greeted by a friendly host who brought me to my table. Our server appeared right away and got me a wine list (I had some catching up to do). The wine selection is great! 

There is a gluten free pasta that I was determined to try but my friends told me unlike the rest of the pastas (that are all handmade!!) the g free isn't and recommended a risotto. The special of that night was a risotto with truffle mushrooms so I took my friends advice and got that.....and I am SO glad I did. Not only is the serving huge but it was the best risotto I have ever had in my life. There was just the right amount of mushrooms to give the creamy risotto flavor and I am actually embarrassed at how much I ate. I quite literally could not stop.

The chef, Michael stopped by and made sure all of the food was good which was very nice!

Great spot in Cleveland's Little Italy if you are looking for a place for dinner for two or a group!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a 5 because the food was seriously amazing but the service was lacking so I have to give it a 4. It took forever for us to put in our drink order and when we finally did it took another 15 minutes to actually get our wine, no joke. However, the food made up for the wait time. Everyone loved what they ordered and finished their plate! 

I had the chicken stuffed with fontina and asparagus and it was delicious. Cooked just right and served with mashed potatoes. A bottle of Cline Pinot Noir was only $30 and it was so good. The wines were all pretty pricey so I'm glad we found something reasonable and satisfying. 

I just think that since this place is so expensive and fancy the service should be top notch. Maybe we came on a weird night but our waitress was MIA. I think Michaelangelo's is great for a date night and Little Italy is awesome. Loved walking around the area. :)"}
{"text":"Visited yesterday for Valentine's and was impressed. Valet was available during a lovely below twenty degree cold Ohio day, but the parking is close to the restaurant. Had the chefs special salad for the evening, which featured mixed greens, pomegranate seeds, goat cheese, and a tasty champagne vinaigrette  that was just divine. Mussels to follow, bathed in a slightly spicy red sauce that was excellent. I had the chef's special 16oz delmonico topped with aged blue cheese and fried onions. 12 hours later I'm still salivating over that steak! My fiancé had the lobster ravioli, which she greatly enjoyed. Split the tiramisu and creme brulee for dessert, and the creme brulee stole the show! A bit pricey, but well worth the money! Will be back around anniversary time!"}
{"text":"This place is all appearance.  For over $100, I expect a lot more.  My tortellini was undercooked.  The wine was drastically overpriced.  They botched my girlfriend's order.  There are take out places here in Lyndhurst that serve better.  For the money, F. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, prepared to order with excellent service.  The kitchen accommodated me by preparing for lunch (at lunch prices) an item on the dinner menu.  The place was empty for lunch. I assume a decent amount of the lunch business goes to nearby university personnel and the schools were closed."}
{"text":"Was extremely disappointed.  Came here with such high expectations.  Lamb was overcooked, service was eh, outdoor seating was eh.  Seafood dishes were horrible (You can get better quality at Olive Garden honestly).  I wouldn't have been so upset if the price of everything was less to make up for the quality and preparation of the food.  Overpriced garbage."}
{"text":"First time to eat here and probably will be my last. 
Atmosphere gets a 5, food gets a 4.5, Service gets a 2. It was just their snooty attitudes and excuses we didn't care for."}
{"text":"Prices are New York high (I live there) and if you served this food in New York you would go bust.  
Food: If you served this food in Italy (where I was born) you be shot for crimes against culture.  Where to start: guys, the starch with the protein is not an afterthought.  The potatoes under my fish were stone cold, and had that oil soaked \"been cooked at lunch\" sogginess.  Like leftover potatoes.  Risotto, chef, does NOT sit for hours, waiting to be plated.  What arrived under the duck was Arborio-rice pudding, and cold. The  saltimbocca (translates literally  to \"jump in mouth\")  was \"saltim sale\" e.g jumps in salt.  
Service: great when it was around.  A new, life time low, overall for me: main course is done and I ask for bill.  Nothing. I get up, ask another waiter for bill after 10 minutes.  Nothing. I wait 10 minutes, look around, in the main room: nobody.  It is 2:30AM Cleavland diner time, 9:30 PM actual local time.  EMPTY, no waiters.  I go back to my room and PHONE  the restaurant to get SOMEONE to answer.  It is the kind of place where two waiters are talking, and I wander by, looking for bathroom, so they shift position to continue complaining about someone's \"attitude\" but dammed if anyone asks \"may I help you\".
Room:  Manager/Chef.  The second room is a windowless yellow painted bunker, with a large flat screen TV and nothing else.  Design tip: serious restaurants do not have 54 in TV's in their dining room.  With all doors closed (staff too lazy to open connecting folding doors) you are in a windowless box, with almost no one else.  There's ambiance. If you are not in main room, leave.
Must be easy to run a restaurant in Cleveland.  This place is a joke."}
{"text":"To follow up on Jacki's comments, M's definitely saved our night. 8 of us enjoyed a meal at the bar without an issue. Ossobucco was incredible. I actually like the darker decor in the bar better than the lighter dining area. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here with 9 friends for my birthday last night. The food was incredible. Portions were huge for half sizes, and affordable to boot at ~$15! I got the black truffle Sacchetti, and the veal tortellini. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday with a group of ten and you would have thought we were the only people in the joint. The wine was excellent and the food was even better. All the servers were attentive but not pushy. You barely knew they were there half the time. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and phenomenal service!  We had the lamb shank and ossobucco as our entrees and superb (but different) braised calimari (healthier than fried?) and an antipasto sampler.  Great amarone wine, superb service, and a wonderful time.  You will be pleased n this very comfortable venue!!"}
{"text":"We at here Saturday night for our Anniversary. I was put off by being charged 5 dollars for valet considering it's off the main strip. It's a nice place as far as decor. It's very loud in the dining room. I had to keep leaning forward to talk to my wife. They need to hang some acoustic tiles from the ceiling. The server was so-so. Took a herculian effort to get a drink. Food was better than average."}
{"text":"FYI - One bartender cannot serve a full bar AND make cocktails for the entire restaurant on a Saturday night. And bar backs are good."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend enjoyed a great evening here. We had reservations but ended up eating in the bar. It has a great fireplace and more of a chill feel. The beat salad was amazing and for the main course she  enjoyed the Sacchetti al tartufo which I highly recommend and I had the scallops which were very good as well. Definitely would go back"}
{"text":"Italian in Cleveland is here.  Love the way the menu is designed. Started with a soup of  cream of crab with asparagus, delicious.  My husband and I shared 4 half plates .  Wonderful ravioli with truffles, three cheese , mushroom and scallops dishes. Loved everything we ordered."}
{"text":"Dined here tonight, may 2nd, with my mom, and my mother in law, And unfortunately I cannot remember our servers name, but my check said server ID 8, Everything was absolutely amazing. Our server had the whole dining room to herself so she was very busy!! yet she still made us feel special. We were celebrating a very special occasion... our drinks, salad, and entrees were so delicious. I ordered the cheese ravioli with sage and spaghetti squash sauce with a salmon filet on the side. It was hands down one of the best dishes I've had in along time. The lemoncello was a perfect after dinner drink, and the tiramisu was to die for!!! Can't wait to come back!  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My husband and I so enjoyed our first experience at Michangelos on Valentine's day that we decided to celebrate our 10th weddding anniversary there in July. It was hands down the WORST dining experience that either of us has ever had (and there have been some doozies!)  OK...my hubby made reservations for a Saturday night and made sure to tell the hostess that it was our 10th anniversary.  We got there a few minutes early and were seated right away at a table in a corner...and then we waited...and waited...then a crabby guy gave us our fancy water...and we waited some more. Meanwhile we watched all of the tables around us get served and waited on. We had to get up and ask the hostess to have our server take our drink order.  A few minutes after complaining a very frazzled server came to take our drink order.  He apologized saying that they were short staffed and he was covering the patio and our dining area.  The weird thing was that all of the tables around us were getting served and we were not.  Odd.  Anyway, I ordered the filet with mashed potatoes and my hubby had ravioli of some sort.  It was completely forgettable.  The steak was cooked well, but the potatoes tasted frozen...they just had an odd flavor.  We complained about the food and the service and we got a frail apology from the server...he looked like he'd been hearing that all night.  We did not order dessert.  We left deflated and disappointed.  It was almost enough to ruin our anniversary.  We went to Carrabba's the next night and had a fabulous experience...great meal and service.  
     Bottom line...Michaelangelos was underwhelming for any amount of money, especially considering it was one of the most expensive meals we've ever had!
     Based on our first experience here and all of the positive Yelp reviews, we are going to give Michaelangelos one more chance ...not sure when..."}
{"text":"I would highly suggest Michaelangelo's to anyone travelling or living in the Cleveland area. My friends and I were in town for work, and it was a great choice. It is a little on the upscale side, and the service was great. 

We had a variety of food, and each option was wonderful. We started off with the mussels and escargot. The mussels serving was huge! It was definitely large enough to share. For the main course, we had the lobster ravioli, chicken entrée, and the mushroom pasta - all of which I would highly recommend. Then we finished off with the tiramisu and the mousse.. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Coworker and I really enjoined this quaint delicious dinner in Little Italy!! Everything was fantastic- she loved her filet and I had the black truffle pasta. Love the option for smaller portion sizes with pasta dishes!! That plus a glass of wine was under $30 and I didn't feel horrible for overeating which is easy to do at Italian restaurants. If i am ever back in the area I will be sure to stop here again!"}
{"text":"The hostess was attentive and responsive Even though we didn't have a reservation. We were escorted to the bar which had tables other than the bar and the ambiance was really nice. The waitress/bartender was nice but she seemed preoccupied throughout the night. I didn't mind but my co-workers did.   The Kobe carpaccio and escargot for appetizer was good. For the entree I had the pork tenderloin which was cooked to perfection. My co workers risotto was bland. I tasted it to confirm, it was bland. My other co-workers ny steak was good. The tiramisu was good. The only reason for  4 stars is the service which was ok and since I'm rating my food was great.   I will come back and try the table service."}
{"text":"A friend told us that the truffle pasta here is the closest thing she's had to the heavenly truffle pasta from Croatia. So we came here specifically to try it and it did not disappoint. 

For two people, we ordered 1 full size Sachetti al Tartufo (truffle pasta), 1 half size Gnocchi con Pesto de Nocciola, and 1 half size Tortelloni di Porcini con Funghi. It was the perfect amount for 2 and we didn't need any appetizers!

The Sachetti was everything we hoped it would be - creamy but light, melt in your mouth clouds of stuffed pasta that will keep me coming back to this place. The gnocci was also so light with a pesto sauce that was bursting with flavor. The tortelloni was ok, and the least favorite of the three pastas with a pretty normal cream sauce. All of these paired wonderfully with the Montepulciano we got.

The chocolate mousse was a perfect, sweet ending to the meal. Overall, we will definitely be coming back for the food even if the service was a little slow."}
{"text":"We had really high hopes for this place but were pretty disappointed. 

Although the eggplant app. was great, everything else was pretty bland and boring. We had a couple pasta entrees - seafood and gnocci, but nothing that will blow your taste buds.

The service was mostly good when we could get any, but our waiter was horribly slow. My husband was about to get up to ask for the check when he finally came over.

The overall ambiance is just 'ok,' it felt very generic. Other people say it's 'cozy' and romantic, but the tables are so close together that the people next to you hear your whole conversation, especially because it gets so loud you have to shout.

The prices are pretty high as well for what you get. We would probably never go back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing! 
We wanted to try everything on the menu! 

So, we ordered a variety of appetizers and shared a few entrées.  Everything was fabulous.  

Sometimes I worry about going to a high end restaurant during the week (like the second string is in the kitchen).  So not true in this case!  Everything was expertly prepared and presented.  

The wait staff was attentive and very professional!  

This will be on the list when I need a pampered, delicious dinner.  For a Tuesday, they had a nice crowd!  Good to see in Cleveland!

Well done!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here to meet my father while he was visiting in on a trip. This restaurant has a great view. It's a bit upscale, so dress for the occasion. I could go on and on and on about the sacchete. Not runny, not bland, not overfilling. The pasta is amazing. Everyone loved the food, and we made room for desert. It was the perfect restaurant for the occasion and I cannot wait to go back."}
