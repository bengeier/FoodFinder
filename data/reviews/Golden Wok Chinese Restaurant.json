{"text":"Don't bother. I have no idea how this place has this many positive reviews. I gave this place a try when I moved here from the east coast about 10  years ago. I forgot why I haven't been back and gave the place another try. I played it safe and ordered the lunch special sweet and sour chicken with an egg roll, fried wonton and fried rice. 

Oops. That was a waste of my money. 

The chicken was simply one piece of white meat that was fried and then cut into smaller pieces  with the sauce on the side. This wasn't terrible but nothing special. I would have preferred individual battered and fried pieces but no big deal . 

As for the rest. To say It was a disappointment would be an understatement. 

I'm not sure I've ever seen \"fried rice\" with nothing in it but rice. No scallions, no egg, no onions, nothing. Just plain rice cooked with some added brown color with no flavor. 
The 2 wonton chips. Lol. Nothing but fried wonton skins with a pea sized filling of some sort. 
The egg roll. Now this is a first for me too. No bits of Pork or any meat. It was simply filled with bean sprouts and cabbage. Are you guys serious? Bean sprouts!  An oil dripping roll of flavorless sprouts and cabbage.  

Well, hopefully Yelp will be around another 10 years so I can see my own review if I get any funny ideas of coming to this place again."}
{"text":"The food is very good. Don't be afraid to discover something new to try. My wife has allergy issues as well as dietary needs. They are very accommodating. They are also very clean."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for thirty years. The food is excellent and the service is first class. If you like Chinese food this is the best place in the Valley.

{"text":"Decided to try this place since there were more good reviews than bad. Unfortunately most of the dinner was terrible. Egg drop soup was too thick and very bland, fried rice wasn't fried..again no flavor and egg roll had a strange taste. The Cashew chicken was ok as was my boyfriends beef dish. Sad to say we wont be going back."}
{"text":"They have my favorite chicken fried rice! I come here just for that rice and also for the wonton chips (with sweet and sour sauce)! I don't know much about the other food on the menu but I do love the rice :)"}
{"text":"Always good and consistent with the freshness and quality. They even customized their chicken broccoli to better suit my daughter!!  Very good service for both carry out and eating in...  My favorite over all other places for Chinese in the valley!!!"}
{"text":"Always GOOD food here. I especially enjoy there Chicken Chop Suey. Family-friendly good prices and great service you have to wait a while but well worth it.

Have a few appetizers while you wait egg drop soup or ribs pot sticks most tasty too.

So if you are looking for a great place for a quite sit down meal that will have you comming back again 

Then you must try this place ..."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast he was very nice. I ordered a shrimp spring roll and was surprised because there was no shrimp inside of it. Also ordered crispy fried chicken and beef chow mein I was satisfied"}
{"text":"Best Chinese good ever. I have been going here since I was 10 years old and travel all over the world and know if you want something with great flavor with good cuts of meat and fresh vegetables, it's not easy to find. Jackie is a great restaurants it and works hard to make sure her food is fresh and flavorful. We love the owners and the food. Great customer service and food."}
{"text":"So unsatisfied! Really looking forward to flavorful Chinese food  I definitely agree about that fact there is no distinction of taste between the orange chicken and the Kung Pao chicken. The freezer section at Wal-Mart has more flavor."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is constantly good and the staff is always friendly. Take out or dine in, I have always enjoyed it and keep coming back. Best egg rolls in town by far! I have recommended Golden Wok to everyone I know in AZ that says they can't find good Chinese food here and no complaints yet."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's my favorite chinese restaurant . Jackie is the best"}
{"text":"Generous portions, very tasty, made fresh to order and was gone with my take out order in less than 10 minutes. Best part (especially for those who work on weekends and get shafted) lunch specials for 6$ every day and it includes a drink! First but definitely not the last time here"}
{"text":"They have the best  cantonese chowmein in east york. Real authentic. Not greasy at all..."}
{"text":"Paid a visit this past Saturday  It was myself, my husband and my brother.  Service was very pleasant.  Food not so much.  The potstickers and egg roll were fine.  The problem was in the entrees.  My husband had the sesame chicken.  He has had this dish hundreds of times from NY to SF and many place in between and this was the first time it was served more like a sweet & sour chicken.  This was not the way sesame chicken was meant to be served.  My brother had a Chinese restaurant staple, shrimp with lobster sauce.  He too has had this dish many times, mainly in NY and he said the lobster sauce left a lot to be desired.  I had the cashew chicken and there was just too many vegetables in there and not enough chicken.  This was our first time here but sorry to say, probably our last."}
{"text":"My absolute fav for Chinese food in the valley.  I know that everything is made to order since they are very accommodating to my needs - I'm allergic to MSG and I just switched to gluten free (they do have gluten free soy sauce).  I know there's many places out there that are not very accommodating or is pre-made, so I really appreciate that I can get exactly what I want.  My favs - crab puffs (they use real crab and not crab with a k), pot stickers, hot and sour soup, chicken wings, Szechuan hot beef, teriyaki beef on a stick, garlic shrimp, and anything kung pao.  I have also asked for items off them menu (salty fish, bitter melon, etc) which probably explains why I've seen Chinese people eating here too.  Best place for Chinese in town."}
{"text":"We've been going to this place for at least 15 years - at 7th Street and Bell first and then when that closed, wechaged it up to the Cactus location. We travel a good 20 miles from I17 and the Happy Valley Rd one way to pick up take out or go out with freinds here. 
The food can't be matched - The place can use some updating, but when the food is this good - who cares....."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken ball a little doughy need more chicken less dough 
Came very quick and was hot"}
{"text":"Definitely not bad! I eat here every once in a while because it's extremely close to my apartment, call in the order and drive right over! Food is fairly consistent, the sauces they have are a little flavorless is my biggest complaint and almost everything is breaded. A little pricey for what you get. The staff is extremely friendly and makes you feel at home. The inside of the restaurant is extremely comfortable, quiet, and clean."}
{"text":"We got take out from here, not expecting the best Chinese food in the world, but we were not expecting to get the worst! We did not like what we got at all. My white rice had a metallic taste to it, and the crab ragoons were very seafood-ish. I got a beef chow mien. The beef was ok but not great and we also got sesame chicken and they were very crunchy with little sauce. I would not recommend Chinese food from here!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food.  I'm not asking for frills here, just consistency with flavors and repeatability.  I understand they're not doing Gods work here, but what they do, they do well.  Kung Pao Beef?  Solid.  Egg drop soup?  As it should be.  Not every dining experience needs to be earth shatteringly brilliant, and thats ok.  If you like the basics of chinese cuisine, come here, as they wont let you down-  Unless you're a hipster douche, and cant be satisfied with something unless foie gras is involved."}
{"text":"I have ate at the Golden Wok since I was a child .  Now 30 years later, I still come here for their delicious food !!!   I can always count on how it is going to taste.  They have never served me a bad meal.  The staff is always friendly .  Jackie & Orlando are great! They always welcome me with a hug & fabulous service!  
I look forward to eating at my favorite authentic Chinese Restaurant ."}
{"text":"If there was half stars I'd give it 3.5. My husband says 4 stars. I can't say it's my all time favorite Chinese food, but it's a heck of a lot better than some places in Phoenix. I can say I'm an east coaster BUT that does not mean I know 'real' Chinese food until I actually go to China to have 'real' Chinese food. I can say, I am Asian and this is good Asian food =) Food is good, service can be good, meal portions are huge, BUT stay away from the egg rolls, it's not so good. Try it and request NO MSG if you're allergic.  Not terrible but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have ever had! My grandmother is a regular and brought my girlfriend and I here for dinner one night. We are both vegetarian and ordered chow mein and spring rolls, and we're blown away! The noodles were cooked to perfection, and the sweet and sour sauce came out hotel as if it were just made in the Kitchen. Very welcoming and comfortable environment. My girlfriend and I came back and got a Margarita for two that was outstanding. We also ordered the best crab puffs either of us have ever eaten. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food...incredible. The $...phenomenally inexpensive. The service and portion size are...amazing!!!
The 1 thing I would change is my having not experienced this places food at least a year and half earlier!!!"}
{"text":"I followed the lead of Yelpers who reviewed Golden Wok as having some of the best chinese food in the valley.  I thought to myself:  How could you have missed this place with great food when I don't live that far from it?  
Well, I shall start by forgiving my fellow Yelpers who think this is great chinese food.  You are forgiven, my brethren.  
As a former East Coaster who has had the taste of REAL chinese food, I have to break it to you.....THIS IS NOT IT.  
The egg drop soup was tasteless which means that a good broth was not developed to create a good soup.  With any good soup,  the base is what makes it.  Plus it was too clumpy from the cornstarch.  
The combination dinner which consisted of orange chicken, an egg roll and \"fried\" rice was a total disappointment.  Orange chicken was nothing more than dough around pieces of chicken with no orange flavor.  They put a few pieces of orange rind as a costume for the chicken.  But even on Halloween night,  this plain-old chicken knows it is not orange chicken.     The egg roll, while not greasy, had little flavor and the veggies inside had no crunch.  The frozen egg rolls I buy from Chung Kung are tastier---really.  The \"fried\" rice.... anyone notice that I put quotation marks around the word fried???? All you English majors probably noticed it.   This cannot be called fried rice.  They took a large batch of cooked, white rice, sautéed it with soy sauce and put it in a holding tank waiting for some sucker to order their combination dinner which comes with \"fried\" rice.  Then, they scoop out a half a cup of the stuff and fling it on the plate along with the other mediocre part of the combo.  Does this sound a little harsh or angry?  Yup, I'm angry that we ordered something called orange chicken with FRIED rice and this so called fried rice is an insult to the palate.  Do they think that we think this is what fried rice tastes like?  Do they think we (by we I mean anyone who steps foot into that restaurant) are ignorant consumers? 
I order the monogolian beef which had a good taste but you needed to have your incisors working perfectly to chew through the meat.  Glad I was at the dentist a few days ago and my incisors are in great shape.  
Ladies and gentlemen of the Yelping Community:  This is NOT good chinese food.  Save your money."}
{"text":"There's nothing worse than chinese food with absolutely no flavor. Can a real chinese food restaurant please find its way to this side of Paradise Valley. Tired of wasting good money on bad food."}
{"text":"The best egg foo young Cantonese style and hot and sour soup. Lovely atmosphere great food super service highly recommend this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"\"Old School\" Chinese food here.  I'm impressed with any lunch menu that emphasizes egg foo young (EFY).  In my opinion, EFY is a lost art of Chinese food, and their EFY is pretty good.  Classic brown sauce, nice patty, nice texture, hot.  A decent munch.  The egg rolls are large and tasty too.  A decent meal, a decent value.  I can see the loyal reviews and I can understand the poor reviews.  Comparing this place to PF Changs is not fair.  This ain't no corporate-chow-conglomerate. It's just an old school Chinese place.  Get the Egg Foo Young!"}
{"text":"Good: fried shrimp
Meh: orange chicken
Bad: szechuan beef, garlic shrimp, ribs, crab puffs
Ugly: hot and sour soup

Wow, I was HUGELY disappointed in this place. I've never had hot-and-sour soup that I considered even average, I'm THAT big of a fan of the soup...this was absolutely inedible. I had two sips and gave up. The crab puffs were full of cream cheese and no crab at all. The orange chicken had a good sauce, but the chicken was pretty apparently frozen chicken nuggets. I could go on but, really, why? Just not what I expected with the Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Coming here for like 30 years with my family & always delicious & fresh!!  We just recently tried the Cantonese-style Egg Fu Young & it is SOOOO good & GF too!!  Yum!!!:-)."}
{"text":"Theres nothing special about this place, just so-so chinese food you can grab on the fly. Its not terrible, but i wouldnt choose to come here if i had another choice."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious and great price. Family owned forever - these people are wonderful and the food is top notch! Try it!"}
{"text":"I ordered so much food based on these glowing reviews. It was not good. Nothing was good. Not flavourful, too greasy, poor quality of meat, forgot the dry noodles for my chop suey even though I paid extra for them. Yuck"}
{"text":"This is a well-executed typical Americanized Chinese food spot.  My family has been going here for 20+ years, and while it certainly isn't high-end or anything out of the ordinary, it always hits the spot. 

My favorite dish is the Golden Wok Chicken - so crispy and garlicky... delicious!"}
{"text":"Nothing stood out about the place. I had lunch here with a friend that is a fan of the place. The lunch came and it was just fine. Besides being quiet and appearing clean the place looked more Japanese than Chinese to me. And the waitperson, well she was icy and abrupt. 
I'm just not feeling that it's a place I will be wanting to revisit anytime soon."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the other reviews here... Nothing stands out about this place, but the food is pretty damn good. I've been here many times and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch. Awful service and rudeness. Water cup had a piece of meat floating in it. No apologies just a new cup of water dropped on the table. Food is much below average. My pork dish had pieces with too much gristle. Had to chew and spit out. Ended up consuming about 20% of the portion and  tossed the rest. What a waste. When settling bill I did ask the owner/manager how a piece of meat made it into a cup of iced water when there was yet no food on the table. Very rudely and arrogantly she replied \"Ask the waiter\".   Will not be back. There are many better places around."}
{"text":"I truly love this place and have for 15+ years.  I even bring people who visit from NY here.  No one has ever had a bad thing to say and I challenge them to not like it.  They always make me my sesame beef and it is so good.  Other local Chinese restaurants won't do that for me and I have asked.  This place is clean and the owners are super friendly.  My kids even enjoy going to Golden Wok!  They are fans of the orange and sesame chicken!  Yummy!  Boy I thinking I am craving some right now."}
{"text":"I have been dining here for 20+ years, and I hope it's around for 20 more. =) 
There's nothing fancy about Goldon Wok, it's a simple chinese restaurant in a strip mall. The food is good, especially their egg rolls. The prices are reasonable, and the owners are very friendly. We often celebrate birthdays here with the extended family, and they are very accomodating for our large parties. We'll bring in a cake for dessert and they are happy to provide us with additional plates and silverware at no charge."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly spot. Family-owned. Really enjoy this place -- highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Food is always extremely  Fresh. Fast service, and always on top of things. Was introduced to this spot from my aunt."}
{"text":"First time here. Very simple place. Quiet and cozy. Nice selection and the food is very good. Nothing crazy on the dishes but as stated very good and will be back again for their cuisine."}
{"text":"We did not have a good experience here. The food was bland and the quality of the ingredients was low.  The server was slow and when we got the food to go sauce leaked out if the bag creating a massive mess. The containers just weren't able to hold all that bland flavor.

If a one star rating doesn't tell you to skip it, I don't know what will."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times. The staff is nice and the ambiance is nice. The food is just meh. There are better options out there."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently started trying out random restaurants to get us out of the habit of eating at the  same places. We came across this restaurant and let me just say I was impressed . Sometimes we judge a restaurant by the exterior portion of it . Outside it looks like a plain old restaurant, once inside the place is beautiful . The food was amazing . I got the shrimp rice noodle soup and my husband the shrimp chow Mein . We were definitely impressed . Restaurant was clean, music was calming , staff was prompt . Overall I'd definitely come again!"}
{"text":"grungey place but the food was great! 
not a place I'd sit down and eat.
The Chinese bbq pork was DELICIOUS ! 
and I had special fried rice too which was avg. 
but the pork.. mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"This place is okay, and kind of pricey for what I ordered. To be honest I would choose Pei Wei over this place in a heart beat. I was trying something new and thought I would give this place a shot, but the food was bland and the Mongolian beef was a little tough and had little to no flavor. The fried rice also looked like they used white rice and mixed a tiny bit of soy sauce to make you think it was fried rice lol just give me white rice because there was no difference just me paying more. I see that this place has received really good reviews so enjoy at your own risk...I will not be coming back to this place even if it was the last Chinese Restaurant on earth."}
{"text":"Food is good, not the best but it's pretty good. Inexpensive and they deliver. Owners are friendly and recognize your face as a regular customer."}
{"text":"If you don't mind have horrible number 2 the day after then this is the restaurant for you. My husband and our son went there this weekend and we all ordered different types of dishes. I had shrimp my hubby had beef and our son had chicken. We all had the runs 24 hours later. Something is definitely going wrong in the kitchen. Stay far far away."}
{"text":"Best food I have had in a long time. Host was energetic, fun and a great conservationist. We will be going back soon !"}
{"text":"After seeing this place for years and never stopping by, we finally tried it. I did live it very much that we have been back a few times in the past 1-2 month.
We have tried a few different items and I think my favorite is the Szechuan beef.

Service has been prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I often hear from friends that there aren't any good Chinese restaurants around.  I then tell them that clearly they haven't been to Golden Wok.  While I agree with the other Yelp reviews that there may not be added frills to this restaurant, I also think that they have consistently provided tasty dishes and good customer service to any diners.  I rarely find myself having to wait when I go.  

The prices are pretty average for dinner though the lunch specials are great deals for filling meals.  It is typically only $7 or $8 for a meal including a bowl of soup, fried rice, egg roll, and an entree (for lunch) and about $10 or so for an entree for dinner and steamed rice (not including soup, egg roll, or fried rice though).  I typically order Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, or chicken with broccoli (or vegetables).  All are great!  

My only disappointment has been in ordering take-out where I haven't found the same quality of food (though maybe it is because I do not eat it quick enough).  Take out orders have been ready pretty quickly though.  Either way, I still recommend Golden Wok to any Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I have eaten here several times. Their egg rolls are enormous and tasty and everything I've ordered so far has been delicious and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Awful. All of the dinners came with the sauce on the side. What the?  Ordered the Golden Wok Chicken and the General Tao's Chicken. Again, sauces on the side (why?!) and not much flavor anyway. This was definitely the Bud Light of Chinese take out."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food from a family owned business. Owners are on-site and happy to accommodate almost any request. Fresh ingredients and tasty food. A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I've been having trouble finding food with flavor since moving to Az, and after lunch at the golden wok, I'm still looking...the egg roll was just cabbage wrapped in a fried shell...please use seasoning. Fried rice..horrible no flavor at all. Crab puffs or Rangoons, just cream cheese in a fried shell..no crab...and no flavor. My sweet and sour chicken was actually pretty good.  I won't be returning... very disappointing and very bland"}
{"text":"The reviews are correct; this is the best Chinese food in the valley! 

I was pleasantly surprised, as I haven't had good Chinese food in Phoenix yet, and I've lived here for over seven years. 

The service was excellent and efficient. The tables and restaurant were all very clean. 

The curry vegetables were deliciously lightly flavored but not too heavy in curry - more like a sneaky spice. The egg rolls were like typical egg rolls, but nice and fresh."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good setting and vibe, was crowded at the time I visited, food was ready fast after order and most importantly the food was not unnecessarily sweet like some other Chinese food in the city, thus it tasted more authentic to me. The staff were quick, helpful to choose the food and friendly. The prices however was higher than other similar restaurants and it was obvious after we got the food. The portions are good for two servings. As a couple I would order one item and share for next visit."}
{"text":"Wanted some good Chinese food takeout, so I tried the Golden Wok. I ordered some Kung Pao Chicken and Garlic Shrimp it was really fresh and tasty. Egg rolls really hit the spot also. I will for sure be back again.  The ladies working there were really nice and had my order 100% correct which is rare for takeout"}
{"text":"Great service and a nice ambience. The veg spring rolls were fresh and perfectly cooked. The vegetable kung pao and chicken schezwan was good but could have been more spicy. The spiciness levels are really low though the items were mentioned to be spicy in the menu card. I would recommend this place for their service and reasonable price."}
{"text":"They are close to my house and my job 
There very sweet always so happy when I go here I come a lot living alone it's great food and the shrimp is amazing"}
{"text":"Confused as to why this place is rated so high.  Really was not a great experience.  Food bland, oily, flavorless; meh at best.  Service nice and owner nice, but the terms \"best\" and \"authentic\"?  Whatever."}
{"text":"Was passing by and tried this spot out on a whim while I was waiting for my car to get washed. 

I'm not picky when it comes to teriyaki chicken as it is usually pretty standard and basic but I was super unimpressed with their take on it. 

Very bland and thin teriyaki sauce with barely grilled chicken. 

For $11 it isn't worth it..."}
{"text":"Get the Orange Chicken! you have to! DO YOU HEAR ME??? ARE YOU LISTENING!!!! No but seriously why this place only has 3.5 stars is beyond me. Wait staff is super nice!"}
{"text":"If I could I've zero stars I would. The restaurant felt sticky and dirty. The waiter was nice but when I asked to place and order for an appetizer I was yelled at and told to wait for my waiter. The waiter never came to get the order so I didn't order. The rice was not hit and in a pan that was cold. The meat was iffy and I was scared to eat it in fear I was going to get food poison. The price was unreasonable, only because everything tasted like it was frozen And from a bag. The general Taos chicken tasted like it was reheated and the sauce was super thick. The egg rolls tasted like they were old and refried. I wouldn't go here!! And I don't plan on coming back. I don't recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised by the bad reviews. Look, this is not a 5 star restaurant, but you get exactly what you are looking for:

Old School Basic Chinese Classics - check
Reasonable Prices - Check
Beer and crazy alcoholic drinks that you would only order in a place like this - check
No frills - check
That placemat that has the zodiac signs of your birth year - check

Think of your favorite Chinese Classic - guess what, they have it!"}
{"text":"Consistently amazing Chinese food with every visit. Their food is fresh and cooked to perfection every time. Great place to dine in or order to-go. The ambiance inside the restaurant is very relaxing and the staff is welcoming and friendly. It's exactly what you would expect with Chinese food no surprises. They also have fair pricing."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Take out in North Phoenix North Scottsdale, PV area!!! I've tried out all the local chinese restaurants in the area. Golden Wok is the best chinese in the area bar none. One thing to note about chinese food in this town is that it is not as ubiquitous as San Francisco or New York. In this very specific part of town this is the best available."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and have always enjoyed it. They have good quality foods and the service is always fast and attentive"}
{"text":"The honey walnut shrimp is amazing, huge prawns!  Ordered cream cheese wontons as well as egg drop soup. Everything was top notch!  Really good food!"}
{"text":"You know a place is great when it has stayed in business for 30+ years!  The Mr. & I have become regulars at this Paradise Valley staple. The dishes are cooked with fresh vegetables and the staff are literally the sweetest folk. We often return for the hot and sour soup and Kung Pao chicken while relaxing in a quiet booth sipping hot tea. #thelittlethings"}
{"text":"don't judge a book by its scuzzy, rough-looking cover. 
the food was flavourful and hot. 
the staff was courteous. 
the BBQ pork and Cantonese chow mein were highlights. 

we think we found our new favourite take-out place. we definitely want to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Nothing special...nothing like Chinese food I like from Congee Queen. Thought to try it because they do UberEATS. Ordered chicken chow mein (too saucy and lacked flavour) and beef with broccoli (okay). Those two things cost $27 with UberEATS (fees and all). Not worth it."}
{"text":"Great orange peel chicken. The service is good and it's usually never that busy if you'd like to dine in."}
{"text":"Super fast and cheap combos for lunch. Not sure what there plate orders are like so I can only share that lunch will fill ya."}
{"text":"Really good!

We ordered the sweet and sour chicken and honey walnut shrimp. Both are fantastic.  The walnut shrimp are huge and perfectly cooked. They serve the s&s chicken like lemon chicken: it's a good piece of white meat, breaded and fried, and then sliced and served separately from the sauce. That way, when I got it home, the chicken was still crispy and delicious. 

Thanks to some crappy reviews this place has gone under our radar until now. Not sure what those people got (or what they wanted) but this is  really GOOD food!"}
{"text":"Food tastes alright but it's certainly not authentic. Dishes were drenched in sauce, egg rolls taste frozen. Only positive note is that it is a very clean establishment with polite service."}
{"text":"Had a few meals at this place, price and quality have been consistent and never disappointed.  The staff is always super nice and when i order party platters they deliver for free.  Their wings are pretty tasty and they don't skimp out on the seafood in their seafood noodle dish. The platters are always packed full and arrive hot.  My only complaint is they always give too much packets of soya sauce (brown bag full).  Not needed as the food has enough flavor."}
{"text":"Good food and good people.  Ordered pickup on they way between work and home without a menu.  The owner walked me through the menu - basically I asked if they had it and either they did or they would make it for me.  Cannot complain about that.  

Food was good, not the best I ever had, but certainly better than most."}
{"text":"This is what I get when I just drive by someplace and drop in.  I had a crazy hankering for Chinese last night so I deviated from my normal practice of researching a place before I go there and I am especially careful when it comes to Chinese places.  So I guess I got what I deserved when I made an impromptu stop at the Golden Wok. 

This place hit the home run of bad restaurants.  Over-priced, bad service and horrible food!  I could have had PF Changs for what I paid at Golden Wok. We ordered Lettuce wraps and the food was cold and I swear the chicken must have been 3 days old. Awful.  Then I ordered Chicken Corn Soup because I love the way Abacus Inn in Phoenix makes theirs.  But again, the chicken was tough and the soup had no flavor.  Then we got our entrees.  I had Lemon Chicken.  I won't even go into how bad it was.  Just go to your local supermarket and buy a frozen sweet and sour dish and you will get the idea.  All of this cost me $50 and I drank water.  

When you are in a location like they have you have to do something compelling to bring people to your restaurant.  Value priced food, exceptional service, or fresh ingredients.  But Golden Wok just wants to be another bad Chinese place. Just like 10,000 other places in strip malls in the valley."}
{"text":"I love the Golden Wok.  My favorite is the Sesame Chicken with a not to sweet sauce. I have also had the beef with peppers which is also very good. It has a nice flavor and fresh peppers and onions. The wait staff is nice and we have never had to wait for a seat during dinner."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Chinese place are the best and this one is on my top list. Favorite place to grab Chinese when I'm in north Scottsdale. Very cozy booth inside and has that retro Asian feel too it. Would recommend getting the pot stickers, they're a must. Dinner wise there orange beef never fails."}
{"text":"This place has been a lucky find for us in the neighbourhood . Moved here about 2years ago and it has been hard to find really good food or nice spots right in the area. 

The actual restaurant itself lacks ambiance and looks very dated. However, I give the food an 8/10. Really good Chinese food.

It's our new place to order from :)"}
{"text":"I look for two things when judging Chinese food - is it flavorful and is it \"clean\". The dishes that I had at Golden Wok definitely checked those two boxes for me. The Kung Pao chicken was the perfect balance of flavor and spice for me and I loved the Beef and Broccoli. Both dishes were very \"clean\" also. Not sure how to explain that exactly, but if you look for clean food,then you know what I'm talking about.

To top it off, the owners make you feel like family and I would equate it to a \"Cheers\" like Chinese restaurant. Go their a couple of times, introduce yourself, and everybody will in fact know your name."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe the poor reviews others have given this place. I have been eating here nearly all my life and I maintain that it is the best place for Americanized Chinese food in the valley. The food is consistenly good and they don't skimp on the proteins or veggies. I challenge you to find a better eggroll (amazing and huge!) ot fried shrimp. Their Chow Mein and egg drop soup are the best I have ever had. To top it off the have an awesome tiki drink menu- the flaming scorpion bowl and the zombie  rock my world but just be careful because they are stronger than they taste!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple weeks ago and got the sesame chicken.  I was disappointed when I saw that it wasn't chunks of chicken, but a boneless piece of chicken that was breaded, fried, and then sliced into strips.  The sauce wasn't that good anyway.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this restaurant a lot.  I was there a few months ago and ordered the cashew chicken.  Although it tasted good, I was not happy with it because of the vegetables.  Very few chinese vegetables in it.  They put in those tiny round green sweet peas instead of snap peas.  There were green pepper and carrots and celery.  I asked the owner on the way out, why didn't I get the cinese vegetables?  He told me that I have to request them.  Excuse me, isn't this a Chinese restaurant?  All he said was, \"Sorry about that.\"  I would think that he would be concerned about keeping customers happy.  Every time I went there for lunch,the place only had two or three people there.  One more thing.  The food is served really fast.  It makes me wonder if they just heat it up real fast instead of cooking it when it's ordered.  I do not recomend this restaurant.  I won't be back.  It's also over priced."}
