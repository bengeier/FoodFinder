{"text":"The food here rocks. It's a mom-and-pop shop & they r really-really nice people. The only drawback is that there are no windows on the inside so take out is my favorite thing to do. Portion are healthy, taste is good and price rivals that of a meal at mcdonalds. Totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"A friend had recommended this place so I and another friend (both fanatics for chinese) went for lunch today.  On the weekends there are no lunch specials so we were forced to purchase a full meal.  We decided to split the sesame chicken.  I also ordered the egg rolls.  I thought the eggrolls we good, nice and crispy with alot of veggies.  The Sesame chicken on the other hand, not so good.  It had an odd tomato sauce, it should be a orangie type sauce.  I was not impressed.  Another odd thing, we were the only ones' there.  May be the lack of specials on the weekends, I don't know.  The place was very clean, the service was fine, but then they had no one else to serve.  I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in town!!  I dine in and pick up frequently and have never been let down!  Food is excellent and ownership is great!"}
{"text":"From the get-go we liked this place.  The fried dumplings were wonderful and crispy on one side and lovely and soft on the other and the dumpling sauce was amazing and just spicy enough.  My husband refused to let it go and finished it over the course of our meal!

On this, our first trip, we had Tangerine Beef and the Crispy duck.  The tangerine beef sauce was sweet and a bit tangy with a touch of spice and the beef was crispy and very tasty.  The duck was amazing.  The tastes were multilayered and well balanced and the crispy coating was salty and peppery and almost buttery under it all.  Together it created a very complex savory and sweet dish with a kick of spice at the tail end.  The flavors in the duck were very reminiscent of Cantonese food in Shanghai...this is the first time I can say this about a restaurant in the states that isn't located in a Chinatown. 

The wait staff was friendly and very helpful, welcoming us back and giving information on some local Asian markets as we left.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times now, but we stopped going a bit ago. I think we just thought that it was a bit grerasy? But I guess all Chinese can be greasy.

Good food and good prices. Would go back if I was craving Chinese."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.....YUCK! This is the worst \"Chinese\"I have had in a long time. I got the Hunan chicken and it was horrible. The chicken was chewy and hard. The sauce was salty and greasy. The egg roll was a mushy mess and tasted like it had been frozen. The service was not very good either. 

Either I have higher expectations of food than others that reviewed, or I might have caught them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Good food. We have eaten here several times, always takeout. They get a little upset when you ask for lemon, but the food is good."}
{"text":"So so good!  Some of the best Chinese we've found in Scottsdale I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Once was quite enough for me!  For those of you who have been eating Chinese in Scottsdale for many years, like I have, the location is the old Eddie Chans.  I don't think \"Joyful\" has been cleaned since Eddie Chan left 20 years ago.  If you like dark and gloomy with dirty bathrooms and cobwebs in the corners of the restaurant and on the fake plants, this is the spot!  It is the Addams Family gone Asian!  

I don't know about other people, but if a place is dirty, especially the bathrooms, I don't want to eat there! Had I used the facilities first, I would not have stayed there to eat.
Like my grandma used to say, \"Soap is cheap\".   There really is no excuse for  not dusting and cleaning a restaurant.  I shudder to think what the kitchen looks like.

The food is barely mediocre.  Pass on this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today. Staff unfriendly, food underwhelming. Lunch came out immediately after soup was served and was lukewarm. Ordered cashew chicken with vegetables and it only had chopped celery and peas. Will not return."}
{"text":"Nothing Joyful about it. Worst I've had in years. The restaurant is in a failing strip mall. No windows, dark and dingy and it smelled of Pine sol.  Staff did not greet us with a smile ( I can't blame them, maybe too depressed). We went at lunchtime and the place was empty - save for one table.  I ordered the Kung Pao as a safe bet. The chicken was hard and rubbery, the sauce was salty - tasted mostly like soy sauce. I thought maybe it was just me, so I took the rest home for my husband. He said it was \"inedible\". Then I told him where I went and he said \"I could have told you that, that place is awful\". 
My friend ordered the Shrimp in Lobster sauce, she said it was ok, but she would never go back. The egg rolls were soggy and greasy and the fried rice was non nondescript. I have no idea why anyone would give this place 5 stars! I know it's been around a while - maybe they are regulars."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ordered take out only on a few occasions, each time wishing it would rise to the level of our native San Francisco favorites.  Alas, it did not, and perhaps that is an unfair comparison.  Bottom line, on the 3 times we ordered to go, the orders were incorrect when we arrived home.  The food seems to be fresh, but the preparations are not consistent, nor are they authentic Chinese. Bland and Scottsdalian.  I suppose the great reviews here, may be warranted my Mid-western snow birds who don't know better.  I am not sure great Chinese food exists in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch special today.  Chicken chow mein, mongolian beef, and garlic chicken were all great on the lunch menu special.  Service fast and friendly and also attentive.  Highly recommend for lunch."}
{"text":"I am really enjoying the  Thai phill king chicken, the food is delicious and decent size portion. They also have a good selections of win and beer you can pick from."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went visits Scottsdale last week and this is the best Chinese food experience I haven't had for long time, I live in california where Chinese food are all over the place, but yet this is one of my favorite place! The service is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Ugh horrible first experience with take out. Only 2 customers in the whole place and very long wait for food even after calling in 20 minutes ahead. Food was marginal won't go back."}
{"text":"I used to go to Joyful a lot along time ago when I lived nearby. It has changed names over the years as it used to be called Eddie Chan's Too. We decided to go this past Friday night for the first time in a long time. The restaurant was empty at 7pm but it appeared they had a lot of take out orders being handled. We were seated quickly and the restaurant was very clean and neat. I ordered the house chicken and fried won tons while my wife ordered pot stickers and sweet and sour chicken. We received our order very fast and the food was fantastic. The pot stickers and fried won tons were perfectly cooked and fresh. We then ate the house chicken and sweet and sour chicken and the chicken was so fresh and tender. The house chicken had a kind of maple/brown sugar taste to it which was amazing! I am already craving the house chicken and cannot wait to go back! The sweet and sour chicken was fantastic as well! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"After several months of trying to find good Chinese food, I was so happy to try this place last night.  I stopped in for take out on my way home and within a few minutes, I was happily on my way with fresh, hot food.  The veggie spring rolls were crisp and light.  Kung pao beef was tasty, with tender slices of beef -- I would have liked it spicier so next time I'll ask, but it was good nonetheless.  Chow mein and bok choy with mushrooms were both yummy.  If you're in the area, this place is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best 10 dollars I've spent on food, great portions to price ratio and excellent food quality, I will continue being a regular"}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food and friendly staff, what else do you need? I didn't expect the place this big  and clean behind its heavy wood mysterious door. Glad  my discovery of combination of healthy and tasty Chinese food there-flavorful but no grease.
I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Arizona. The potstickers are amazing, the golden noodles are awesome, the egg rolls are great, the orange chicken is great, the moo shoo is great. Everything is great!! It is certainly a hole in the wall and the building isn't stunning, but is super authentic and tasty."}
{"text":"What can I say? My sister told me about this place and I wasn't sure as it's located in a nondescript strip mall shopping center. Don't let that fool you or the modest decor. It is insane ! I call it crack Chinese because I cannot get enough of it! I have a bunch of co workers hooked too. The moo goo gai pan is great....chicken cope suey with super fresh vegetables .. To die for. This is the most authentic Chinese I've ever had. I'm there three to four times a week!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food, great people and a nice quiet place to dine. This was my first time here. My sister and her friend have gone here for many years and wow at the food. So so good and fresh. Loved every bite."}
{"text":"This place is real good, get the dumplings skip the egg roll , the duck sauce is sweet and sour actually not my thing. We got the chicken chow mein which is actually Lo Mein in southwest really good and the house fried rice excellent ."}
{"text":"When I lived in the area I would order take out for Joyful at least once a week. It got to the point where they would recognize my voice, they'd confirm I wanted 'the usual, and I'd pick up my order in 10 minutes. Great family run restaurant in central Scottsdale. Prices are fair and the food is quite good. A few nights ago a group of friends and I were in the area so I suggested we stop by. Everyone was very satisfied with their selections, Mongolian Beef for me, Hot and Sour Soup, Joyful House Chicken, Beef and Broccoli, and Kung Pao chicken. Everyone was highly satisfied with their selections. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I ordered crispy noodles as a app/snack (they're my favorite), I asked for an order to go and they 'gifted' me the order ($2.50). It was a very nice gesture. I would highly recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"First time went to this place, the services were nice, dishes were served fast and delicious, the vast part was the price is fair."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town, period. The food is always fresh, the dining room is always clean, the service is impeccable and the waitresses always pleasant. I really can't say enough about joyful! You'd think I was paid to write this review but truth is the food is just fantastic. At this point it's the only Chinese place I go. Whenever I get the chance I bring my friends and family; every person I've brought has loved it. Also extremely cheap prices which is crazy considering if they charged 400$ per Kung pow two Id still go there every week. Joyful is a go to place for any occasion. Much like a fine cigar joyful is relaxing and full of amazing flavor. So next time your thinking of enjoying a cigar on the balcony; think again. Think joyful."}
{"text":"Very nice neighborhood restaurant. We had the tangerine chicken and the Kong Pau beef; both were flavorful and fresh. Neither was particularly spicy, so if that's your preference you might want to be specific about it when ordering. The vegetable spring rolls were also very well done and the service was attentive and pleasant. A good overall choice for a casual dinner with friends and family."}
{"text":"It is difficult to find good Chinese food in the Tempe/Scottsdale area. With that said, in comparison to the various Chinese places in the Tempe/Scottsdale area, the quality and taste of the food here is pretty good for the price.  It is more expensive than ACE (which I am a fan of because it is decently good food for a really cheap price), but the quality is also better too.  This would be my go to place for Chinese take-out if not for the location. :("}
{"text":"I really like this place and try to stop in whenever I'm in the area. Food is always good and so is the service. Had the wor wonton soup for the first time and I loved it! It had chicken shrimp and wontons plus cabbage, zucchini and snap peas in a hearty broth. This is my favorite Chinese place around. I only wish I lived closer to it! I also had the lunch special beef and vegetables but got it with chicken instead. Amazing! Just what I had hoped for! Delicious chicken with mushrooms, bok Chou, snap peas and more in a tasty brown sauce. So good I want to come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I miss Eddie Chan's, which was in this location for about 25 years. The food is about the same, but the prices were better. Oh well, economy and all that.

I've only had takeout from here. I feel like I'd be dishonoring Eddie Chan's memory by sitting down to eat.

A bit better quality than you might expect from a hole-in-the wall joint in a creepy, half-deserted strip mall."}
{"text":"It's an amazing place for authentic Chinese cuisine. The ambience too is very authentic and feels good. I'd definitely recommend this."}
{"text":"I live nearby and have been to this restaurant many times.

The food - good - always tasty and I can recommend the sweet and sour soup, tofu vegetables, pork and vegetables, beef and broccoli - never had a bad dish here.

The service - better to do take-out than dine-in.  They don't have a lot of help so you wait a long time.  This might be a family business.  I'm not sure.  But if you call in your order, they have it ready fast."}
{"text":"The waitresses are very nice and helpful, 
the place is clean and the food is good, the best Chinese food of the area."}
{"text":"Joyful is a great place to go for some good Chinese food. It's located in a small shopping center along with a dry cleaners, a gas station and a few other mom and pop places. 

Every time I go to Joyful I always enjoy my meals. I usually go for dinner and get their chow mien dinner special, which comes with chow mien (obviously), egg fried rice, a vegetable egg roll and two tempura shrimp. Their Joyful house chicken is also very delicious. It has just the right amount of batter on it, and is fried to crispy perfection. The Chinese food has never been sub par, and always tastes like its made to order. You can also hear the chefs in the back cooking your meal as the order is given to them, so no worries about freshness. 

They also serve Thai cuisine. I've had some of their curries, and although they are good, they're not the greatest Thai curries I've had. However, that being said, my rating for Joyful still stays at a four star, because it is a Chinese eatery, not a Thai joint. 

Probably the only downside to Joyful would be the interior seating, as it is very dated, dark and silent--except for the Asian television that the owners and employees sit down and watch in their down time. The service is alright, as the waitresses (I'm assuming they're all family) don't speak much English and seem to hover over your table as you're holding conversation. It's not terribly bothersome though. 

If you're looking for a quiet, moderately-priced place to get un-overdramatized Chinese food, joyful is the place to go."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch at 2:25. Was told lunch special was only til 2:30, so we thought, \"great we made it in just in time for lunch\". Unfortunately they had decide to close lunch early this day so no soup and no fried rice. Makes me wonder if I am getting the old food. Overall the food was good but nothing special. I would gave given them 4 stars but I was disappointed with the lunch, I would have loved some soup."}
{"text":"Ate here several times for lunch & dinner. Food is always good and so is the service. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Delicious! !  Clean restaurant.  Traditional  atmosphere.  The staff is exceptional with sevice and wonderfully  pleasant. Food is light...not heavy or oily. Chow mein.....delightful!   Thank you for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"I'm typically not a Chinese food eater, but my fiance loves it.  This place is good overall.  We do takeout, so I can't speak on eating in.  The food is fresh and portions are very good.  

My only complaint is that it seems a bit overpriced but it's worth it.  For a picky Chinese eater, I won't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Lunch is a very good value. Dinners are over priced. Some of the staff speak very little English. One woman in particular doesn't understand anything! She often works the phones to take orders. Haha! Interesting. So usually the order needs to be repeated back about five times. They are not open on Sundays. Food is pretty tasty but not worth the dinner prices they charge."}
{"text":"I've lived right by this restaurant for years and finally tried it! On our first visit, we ordered takeout for a Chinese New Year celebration, and everyone really enjoyed it, including my son...who up until that point refused to even taste anything from a restaurant that doesn't serve hot dogs, hamburgers or cheese crisps. This weekend, when my son mentioned he wanted Chinese food for dinner, i jumped on the chance to have an actual sit-down meal with my family. The server was very kind and extremely accommodating. She recommended sweet & sour chicken with the sauce on the side (essentially the equivalent of Chinese Chicken McNuggets :), which was perfect for him...he cleaned his plate (and asked to take home the leftovers...also a first! Great local restaurant...we'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for Chinese food in the valley!  Everyone in our family loves it here, and that is saying something with 3 picky teenagers!  We come here to eat about once a month and they always remember our order.  One time my son came in with his friends and he couldn't remember what I order for him, and the server had to remind him ~ and she was spot on.

We always start off with a large order of wonton soup for my kids and me.  The broth is so delicious and they are very generous with the wontons and pork.  My husband gets a bowl of hot and sour soup and loves how spicy it is.

From there, we order fried wontons, Mongolian beef, the Joyful House Chicken, Moo Shu Chicken and Honey Walnut Shrimp.  Everything s always tasty and the portions are very large (we always have leftovers). They are super friendly here and are very good about refilling the hot tea and rice bowl (my kids can't seem to get enough).  I am craving the Moo Shu Chicken right now...

We have been coming here for about 3 years and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"I discovered this place on the way home from work one evening. I'm glad I did. The fried rice is excellent and so is the lemon chicken. The decor inside the restaurant is very authentic and somewhat mysterious. The food is very flavorful and tasty. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Waited 5 minutes for anyone to come to front to seat us. We needed gluten free as an option and lady couldn't speak English enough to understand our question. She really didn't care to even ask someone to get an answer. She left for another 3-4 min, we decided to leave. First impression was not good. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Quick hot and delish.   The best Chinese food in town.  With Door Dash I was very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around. Always cooked fresh to order.  Staff is friendly and attentive.
Nice to go packaging if you'd rather eat at home."}
{"text":"My elderly neighbor (94 yrs old and totally with it, mentally and physically) recommended this place. I thought, oh man, I don't know but we'll give it a try.  OMGeeee !! This place ROCKS!!!  The food was so good, like seriously, EVERYTHING I had, everything my friend  had..it was all soooo good!!!!  

The people were super friendly and attentive.  I am not sure about the name though, maybe because eating there is joyful?  IDK, but if you are ever near here... GO!!!  It was soo good !!!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect hole in the wall Chinese restaurant!

If you are looking for ambiance, this is not the place!  It's a great little spot and the food is spot on. The staff is super nice, very attentive and they are full of insightful help. 

We settled on a large bowl of sizzling rice soup for starters and it was perfect!  

Next we had a Mongolian beef, a joyful chicken and the kids ordered chicken noodles (I cannot remember the actual name).

All 3 dishes were brought out steaming hot and they were solid!  Big portions and tasty all the way around. The extra almond cookie was a delightful treat. I know I'm not the only one that gets a kick out of the poor grammar when unwrapping the fortune cookies!  Come on, admit it. No one is looking!

There is plenty of parking, as the shopping center has 3 \"beauty salon\", a pet groomer and a veterinarian.  Lucky for us...  The vet and the pet groomer are not too close to raise any suspension as to the origin of the tasty meat.  I think I may have heard someone crying leaving the groomer & a man shout \"dog die... 'Comprication' but then again, maybe not"}
{"text":"I like Chinese food. When I lived in San Francisco, I lived in the Inner Richmond (before it was run over by the Hiptards, when it was a fun Chinese neighborhood), and would go to various restaurants with a friend, Chinese, so we got taken care of all the time.

Now in LA, it's more about Korean and Thai, but I still love my Chinese food.

I flew in to see the parents, and we headed over to Joyful for dinner. The parents have been there a few times, and a friend of theirs is a NY'er who is fanatical about his Chinese food, and he goes once a week. 

Spoke to the wait staff, from Hong Kong and Macau via Vietnam and then Los Angeles. They have Cantonese and Mandarin style, as well as a few Thai and curry dishes.

We ordered egg rolls, vegetable egg rolls, vegetable egg foo young, beef chow mein and chicken moo shu. All were amazingly good, and fresh. That's the key: really, really fresh.

The chow mein noodles were homemade, nice and fresh. The beef was a nice quality, and thick pieces.

The moo shu, for me, was the best. They hand roll the crepes in the back, coming out in tightly wound roll. The chicken and vegetables were nice and fresh, white meat. And the extra hoison sauce was perfect.

And they give you almond cookies and fortune cookies at the end, which isn't really Chinese but who cares. :)

All in all, it's a four and half star place. The fifth star, however, is to offset Lauren. Sorry you didn't get utensils, but really the food is much better than 2 stars. And, the hotel should have been able to supply you with fork, knife and spoon ... just tip the bell boy $2 and you would have been set."}
{"text":"A total surprise. I ordered curry chicken, and it was so good.  The coconut milk totally blends and to the soup, giving it a milky taste.  My partner ordered stir fry vegetables with scallops. It is good as well but I like curry chicken better."}
{"text":"This place has great food, a little on the more pricier side of the local Chinese food. But it is worth it. When you dine in, its a great relaxing environment."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from uber,  crab puffs and fried rice. Got 1 little soy sauce and 1 sweet and sour. Then ordered from grub hub, crab puffs and pot stickers. I said extra.sauces, I got 1 mustard and 1 small sweet and sour. REALLY!!!!!!!!!. I didn't accept it."}
{"text":"Shocked at how bad Egg Foo Yung was. No green onion, onion, ginger, sesame oil, carrots, bean sprouts. No BBq pork. Just over-cooked flavorless diced pork. Gravy tasted like water, corn starch,  soy sauce Flavorless. No salt, pepper. Not sure what vegetable filler. Guessing cabbage. Waste of $12.50 + tip for a lunch. Been going there since 2003. I make egg foo yung every 6 weeks. It's not rocket science. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Staff is nice and the food was delicious! My fiancé and I are obsessed! We definitely recommend this place and it's rarely ever super busy! Very chill and the place is kept nice and clean"}
{"text":"This is my families take out of choice. I have never eaten inside so can't comment on the dining room service but have always had a great experience with the food."}
{"text":"We've eaten here 3 times now and haven't been disappointed yet. We've tried their Kung Pao Beef, Egg Foo Young and their General Tsos which were all good."}
{"text":"Dinner was good tasty. Egg rolls was 'lightly' stuffed, so more wrap than filling - disappointing. Wonton was tasty but the bok choy (greens in soup) in soup was way over cooked - muss like. Cost very expensive, lunch was $25 for one person = soup, egg roll and meal."}
{"text":"Four for dinner Saturday nite. Great selection of food and beers. Food was tasty and the sauces that came with were just as tasty. Great service, smiling faces and reasonably priced; we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This review isn't so much about the food as is it is about shady practices and lack of customer service.
Being from NYC I'm very biased when it comes to Chinese food. Admittedly Joyful is better than all the other Chinese restaurants I've tried here in the Scottsdale.
The shady practices come in when I placed an order to go. Total, $42.40.  Seems there credit card \"swipe\" machine was broken and had to make an impression by hand. Ok, no problem.Order was filled I signed the receipt for the $42.40. Two days later I go to my bank to withdraw money and check balances. To my surprise Joyful took the liberty of charging me $742.40!!

I'll cut to the chase. Joyful denied charging me this amount even as I showed them my bank statement and had them speak to an associate from BoFA. 5 days to clear up by stopping payment, filling out reams of paper work etc. A nightmare that could have been handled easily by Joyful by looking at the facts/checking them and refunding my 700.00. 
They've lost a customer. Unfortunate because it took me a year to find adequate Chinese here in AZ. 

The search begins anew."}
{"text":"Everything you expect from a non-high end Chinese restaurant. The food is great and the prices are totally legit. This is a great go-to place anytime you're craving Chinese and I would even recommend this place to take people from out of town. I took my family here for Christmas dinner and couldn't be happier. The only reason I may not give it 5 stars is because the place was packed (on Christmas Day of course) and service was a tiny bit slow. Otherwise - we loved it!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst restaurants in Scottsdale.  The food is just pitiful.  The service is OK as befitting a small neighborhood restaurant.  We had egg rolls that were so dripping in oil that it was leaking out as you picked them up.  Bright yellow oily drippings. Not cool.  The kung pow was so-so as was the garlic chicken.  The best part of the meal was the almond cookie!  Even the fortune cookie was sub par. I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale for the holidays and was not willing to shell out a fortune for one of the hotel Christmas buffets, so I decided to go for Chinese.  Because they were so crowded, I decided to get the food to-go.  The cashier was quite friendly, but that can only get one so far.  First off, despite my pleading that I definitely needed to get chopsticks or some utensils because I was staying in a hotel, and despite her repeated assurances...I get back to my room and of course no sticks, no fork, no napkin, nada.  I had the hot and sour soup, it was alright.  The crab puffs were actually pretty good.  But the shrimp in lobster sauce did not taste very good and actually upset my stomach.
If this is the best the area has to offer, remind me to skip the Chinese food if I come back to town."}
{"text":"First (and last) time at Joyful.  On the positive side, they are friendly, the service is good, the place is clean and it's also relatively nice for a strip mall Chinese restaurant.  On the downside, which is the most important factor, the food is mediocre, at best.  Actually, I take that back.  It's pretty bad.  2 stars for the above mentioned pluses, but zero stars for the food.  War wonton was the smallest \"large\" portion I've ever seen.  No pork present and it only had 2 strips of chicken, (processed and rubbery) 2 whole wontons and 1 broken piece of a third.  Never had this few wontons in a large serving and never saw such a small bowl.  Taste was okay, portion and \"stuff\" in it, was minimal.  Other items well priced and large portions, but wasn't interested in eating them, so it didn't matter.  Sweet and sour sauce too sour and too thin.  I am surprised at all the positive comments, but then I noticed they are rather old, so maybe things have changed since.  Wish it was better, cuz the location is perfect, the price is right and they seem to be nice people.  I'll take Golden Wok over this any day."}
{"text":"I was being super lazy tonight and ordered grubhub delivery from joyful dining tonight. I was a little skeptical based on some other previous reviews, but live very close to the location and was interested in trying it anyways. I will tell you I ordered the crap puffs, crispy duck with fried rice and barbecue pork slices... They were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing! I was hesitant on the way I would have received my food, but when it was delivered to my location the duck and crab puffs were still crisp! And everything was still warm! They did an amazing job! Everything tasted fresh and had very good flavors I would honestly recommend this place to anyone and will come back again! This is the longest review I've ever made because I really felt like this please deserves it! :)"}
{"text":"This used to be my immediate go-to when craving Chinese food.  I dined here this evening for the first time in several weeks.  The great staff they used to have is gone.  Instead, there were a couple of ladies with zero personality rushing us through our meal and insisting the ownership/management had not changed.  This was a blatant lie.  The food was slightly off, the service was definitely off and our experience overall was not good.  I have recommended this restaurant many times but I can no longer do so.  So extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the shrimp and lobster sauce. Shrimp stuffed Eggplant so good. The moo shoo pork was flavorful with crisp veggies and yummy crepes. Combo fried rice was really tasty."}
{"text":"After trying to find some decent Chinese food near work for lunch, I saw this place and decided to give it a go. I was not disappointed!

I arrived around 11:15am during the week and there was only one other table there while I dined. The servers were very attentive and nice, and the food came out quickly. 

For the price, I thought their lunch specials are a great deal. My total with tax was just under $9. They have several entrees you can chose from, all which come with soup, a veggie egg roll, a crab Rangoon and fried rice. Portion wise you definitely get enough to walk away full in my opinion. 

I settled on the tangerine chicken, and today's soup was egg drop. The soup came out first, was nice and hot, and the rest came shortly after. The flavor of the tangerine chicken was great, had some heat to it but wasn't too spicy. The friend rice was nice and the egg roll was super crispy and hot. I really enjoyed the meal and will return again for sure. 

If you want a reasonably priced and filling lunch, this is the spot for Chinese."}
{"text":"Joyful Chinese not all that joyful for me. 

It's tough to find a traditional Chinese restaurant these days. Most everything is some sort of Asian fusion grill. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I like that too. But I was excited to find an \"old school\" Chinese restaurant near my house. 

We went to Joyful Chinese for dinner. It's a modest place, but a pretty nice atmosphere for a Chinese restaurant. We were happy to see that most of the tables were filled - usually a sign of good food. 

In the evenings, they offer a Dinner Special plate for a value price. There are about a dozen entrees to choose from and each platter comes with a small egg roll, two fried shrimp, egg fried rice, and then the entrée of your choice. I think it was about $10 or so. I ordered the Black Pepper Steak and I thought it was pretty good. My husband thought it was too spicy and not in a good way, just a bland heat. He ordered the Joyful House Chicken. The sauce was sickeningly sweet. Neither of us could finish it and that's saying something for the two of us \"clean your plate\" eaters. 

The vegetarian egg roll was just okay, the shrimp were a tad better. But overall, the food was sub-par and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Forget the Big Chain Chinese Restaurants; this is by far the BEST Chinese restaurant in the Valley serving Outstanding FRESH food with friendly warm welcoming service. Don't miss this one."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!

So when I first started going here I scored and found a dish that was absolutely amazing... Hunan Spicy Two.  I literally ordered this dish every single time I went under the thought that the dish was so delicious there was no way anything could match it.  By suggestion of the owner, I began to branch out and I gotta say, every dish is better than the last... like they just keep getting better.  Their sauces are spot on and amazing.  Absolute perfection every time.  I'm a big fan of sauces in Chinese cooking and their dishes are made saucy and not dry.... so good.  

It's a restaurant with no windows and the inside isn't totally chic, but it's no-nonsense mostly Cantonese style Chinese food with a hint of Thai.  Give it a shot.

{"text":"For the past 6 years that I living in the Scottsdale and Tempe area, I have my fair share of trying an exhausting list of large and small Chinese restaurants. I'm very critical when coming to Chinese food, and usually, don't like somewhat Americanized Chinese food. However, Joyful Chinese dining really surprised me with the taste of the food and the top-notch service. The food is right on the point that's not too oily, salty, or overcooked(especially the veggies). The BBQ pork was very tender with a nice mouth-smacking sweet glaze on the outside. The orange chicken actually has a very pleasant hint of citrusy flavor. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service with fairly decent Chinese food compared to some other local restaurants.

Tired the Mongolian Beef and Hunan Spicy Two, both were very delicious.

The beef was tender but a little salty.

The Hunan was likewise tasty but not very spicy, maybe a 1 or 2.

Will certainly put Joyful on my list of regular places to eat."}
{"text":"Been more than a bit busy as of late and haven't done any reviewing. (Although I do admit I've been using Yelp (as always) for my viewing pleasure-- just haven't been giving anything back.) However... last night's takeout dinner from Joyful Chinese was so good, I had to take a moment to post a review. I must do everything I can to ensure that others frequent this establishment, so I will continue to have my much needed Chinese fix met. 

I admit it, I am addicted to Asian food. I love it all--sushi, dim sum, Thai, Vietnamese, etc., etc.-- but none more than just good old-fashioned Chinese takeout. I MUST have it once a week, or I begin to have serious withdrawal symptoms. 

When I lived further North in Scottsdale, we used to alternate between Flo's and Shanghai Club weekly. Flo's, while a bit out of the realm of usual Chinese, is always delicious and Shanghai Club was (IMO) the epitome of really good, traditional Chinese fare. However, these days, Flo's is too far to be convenient and alas, Harry finally succumbed to the pressures of the economy, and it seems as if Shanghai Club is no more. (I almost cried when I discovered they had closed-- I'd been eating there since it opened (as Royal China) in 1992.) 

Since the loss of my favorite place, hubby, son and myself have been searching (in vain until now) for a suitable replacement. We have tried--literally-- just about every Chinese restaurant within miles of our home. Most have been absolutely AWFUL, and a couple have been okay, but not worthy of a weekly repeat. 

Finally(!!) last night was a winner!! Joyful Chinese was voted by all three of us as delicious and near perfect on all dishes!! 

First off, we had the Hot and Sour soup. This is the dish by which we tend to judge all Chinese restaurants. (Flo's is a bit nontraditional with undertones of Cilantro but oh so good, and Shanghai Club's was perfect in every way!) Most of the places we have tried as of late can not make a good Hot and Sour if you paid them-- which we did!! The usual mistakes include too dark, too cloying, too peppery hot and not depth of flavor hot, too bland, and so on, and so on. When we picked up our box of food last night, Jacob almost yipped with glee when he saw the color of the H&S through it's container; it looked perfect!! And the flavor lived up to its color. The soup was hot (but not peppery); it was sour. The taste was full-bodied but not at all cloying, and it was filled with the correct amount of egg, tofu, shrimp and other goodies. All in all it was delicious!! 

In addition to the soup, we had pot-stickers, Black Pepper Beef, Yui-Shan Pork and Curry Chicken (minus the potatoes-- I don't really like them and besides, who needs the added carbs!). Everything was wonderful!! The pot-stickers were as good as Angela N. described in her review back in April-- \"wonderful and crispy on one side and lovely and soft on the other and the dumpling sauce was amazing and just spicy enough.\" The main dishes were all delicious and (as they should be) each unique in its flavor. (Sooo many of the places we have tried recently seem to make every dish taste almost exactly the same--yuck!) The beef was tender and flavorful with the perfect amount of pepper and spice. It had an excellent balance of green peppers, onions and mushrooms but still more beef than anything. The pork was perfectly spicy and pungent and it had all the appropriate julienned veggies (carrots, celery, etc.) that help make Yui-Shan one of my favorite dishes. Finally, the curry chicken was full of flavor, spicy but not killer hot and just the right amount of coconut milk to make the sauce thick and rich but not goopy or cloying. 

I can honestly say that I liked all three of these main dishes equally. And when I asked the hubby which one(s) he'd like to take, as leftovers, for lunch today, he stated that they were all so great I could choose my pick first. That's high praise from him!! (For the record, I gave him the beef, I took the curry and I saved the leftover Yui Shan to eat cold (yum!) for breakfast one morning. I know it sounds weird, but try it; it's delish!!) 

Wellll... this review got a bit long. But I needed you to understand just how important it is that you try Joyful Chinese (and send everyone else you know there too). They've been open for 4 years, according to the very nice lady who took our order, and only 4 people have reviewed them. Trust me; go there, and then write a review. We need to keep great-tasting, traditional Chinese places like this around. There are far too many mediocre ones taking over!! 

p.s. As a side note-- if my memory serves me, this is the location that years ago used to be Eddie Chan's when he and Flo were still married. So the place has been there forever (even though the center is mostly dead), and it still looks like I remember it from when I was a kid, and my parents used to take us here weekly. Now you know where my addiction started."}
