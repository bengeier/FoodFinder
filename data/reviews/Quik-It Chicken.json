{"text":"Stumbled upon Quik-It Chicken on the 4th of July...we were very happy it was open since many places were closed.  The ribs...this beef was remarkable. These are literally the best ribs I have ever eaten. Also, the cornbread was on point. Very affordable overall, especially for the chicken/meat.  Don't judge a place by it's location, looks, or the surrounding area. Just because it's in a less-developed part of the city doesn't mean it's not quality eats. The bathrooms were a little dirty/under-maintained, that would be my biggest qualm. Additionally, the greens were overly salty.  The owner was friendly and engaging. I will be back."}
{"text":"I had not been here in many years. I am very happy to report that the chicken is just as good if not better than I remember. I got the family pack, chicken for three I believe it was called. The chicken was so juicy, not greasy at all! Very tasty! The service was wonderful. The kind gentleman running the place when I was there was very welcoming and made ordering very easy. I chose the macaroni and cheese and greens for our side  dishes. The cornbread was out of this world too! It was very sweet and tasty. I would love to have this place cater an event for me. It would be great for a birthday party or just a weekend gathering of friends. I live near the South Side of Pittsburgh and I have never had food this good on this side of the river as far as good down-home cooking. I'm surprised that there was not a line out the door for this place it is that good! So please do not be put off by the gas station facade. The area was safe and I parked in between the gas station and the Rite Aid. My husband was very pleased with the order and we will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Service was topnotch; he treats you like he's known you for years. Chicken is unexplainably good; yams and apples to die for. Excellent owner."}
{"text":"Best chicken in the burgh!!! I work on the northside myself & a co-worker order about once a week. The owner is also super friendly!"}
{"text":"I love their fried wings!!  Always good!  Whenever I am on the Northside, that is my go to place. The prices are reasonable. Also try the Mac and cheese and cornbread."}
{"text":"Most likely the best fried chicken in town. Don't let the gas station locale dissuade you. In addition to the chicken, other stand outs are the corn muffins, sweet potatoe pie, mac&cheese, ribs and lots of other sides. The food is always fresh and the owners, cooks are as nice as can be. Support local neighborhood restaurants!  I drive from Aspinwall for this food!"}
{"text":"Chicken here is always hot and delicious as are all the sides! I've never been disappointed. Been a repeat customer for years and years"}
{"text":"Really good chicken and cornbread. Make sure you get some hot sauce. The owner is really friendly. Ask for some syrup with the chicken it's delicious."}
{"text":"I had the chicken wings with fries, REALLY great food. I loved it- I was half way through the wings before I got home ! Food tastes fresh and is slammin. Ohh and the cornbread I could eat cornbread until I slip into a food coma!  The owner is super nice and you can tell he puts his heart and soul into the food he makes. There are a lot of sides too, I didn't get to try them but I will next time I stop in. Great food good prices, thank you  Quik-It!"}
{"text":"Quik It has been around for a long time and I remember my mom stopping by after church to pick up chicken for dinner or just to munch on. I was in the neighborhood and had a hankering for something soulful, so I stopped.  I MUST say something about the appearance of the \"joint\". This is a gas station, restaurant and hair place rolled into one but separated by 2 doors. Talk about convenience...if you're into weaves n stuff. Lol The restaurant looks like a fast food establishment but nothing was inviting about it. There are signs advertising specials everywhere but they are very confusing because a few of them had different prices for the same combos. You're better off just paying attention to the board behind the counter. To the left of the counter are a few old greasy fryers and based on the looks of them, I doubt they work. No big deal but they're dirty and I just wonder why someone would put them there...of all places. Did I say they are dirty?  The sides are set up in plain view, just like the picture on here shows.  I'm addition to the items I selected, the case held stewed tomatoes, red beans n rice, stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, green beans and I may be missing something. There were sweets advertised on one of the posters but I don't remember seeing a list of what was available. The chicken is supposed to be the star of the show but, when I visited tonight, it was sitting off to the side with no warmer on and I didn't smell that just fried chicken smell. You know the smell I'm talking about. (Unless you've never fried chicken--- tell me it ain't so!) Anyway, I didn't feel like being inquisitive so I just went with the Quik It bowl which consisted of 2 sides and cornbread for $3.99. I chose greens and Mac n cheese to go. The lady who waited on us was very nice and offered up smiles which I truly appreciate.   When I got home and tasted everything, it wasn't bad. I will even venture to say it was tasty. The greens were seasoned well. The Mac n cheese was the Stouffer type but a tad bit cheesier if that makes sense. It was the comfort food I needed on this chilly night. Now, the cornbread muffin may need its own review because it was HEAVENLY! OMG...it was like a sweet pillow of moist ground corn. Sorry, I can't even put it into words. Let me put it to you like this, when I saw my daughter almost throw away her untouched muffin, I was ready to dive across the kitchen to stop her from committing that sin! Lol It really was yummy!  I plan to go back and visit to try the chicken from my past and then update this review."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, and fair. Best place for lunch in the city. The apples and yams are a must have!"}
{"text":"Great chicken and sides (the greens are a little too spicy for my taste, I get the yams and apples) friendly service! Wish they had more drinks in stock. But I love me some quick-it chicken!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here for the first time tonight. They didn't have everything we ordered initially, which should have been our first warning that we should have just cancelled and ordered from somewhere else. When the food arrived, items were not included that were supposed to be. The macaroni and cheese was poorly textured, the chicken was average at best, and since we didn't receive the cornbread it's probably safe to assume that was average as well. The chicken that arrived was not as described on the menu, meaning the pieces were completely different than what was anticipated. We would not recommend ordering from here, and will not be trying this again."}
{"text":"At first glance, Quik-It Chicken might confuse you.  It's half of a little store that's part of a gas station.  And the other half sells urban hair products.  So it seems an unlikely place to get a good piece of chicken.  But if you have the nerve to try it, I think you will find it worth your while.  I ordered two individual meals, each coming with with two sides, cornbread and dessert.  I decided to order a little bit of everything: both white and dark meat, collard greens, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and baked beans.  The fried chicken is simple but very good.  I preferred the chicken breast and the wings were the big whole wings, not the tiny wing dings you get at a bar for wing night.  The greens had a bit of a kick, which I actually enjoyed.  The beans had a nice sweetness to them and the mashed potatoes were very creamy.  The cornbread was moist and delicious.  The mac and cheese was cheesy and good.  When asked if you want apple or sweet potato pie, opt for the sweet potato.  The apple is pre-packaged Sara Lee slices while the sweet potato, like everything else, I believe is homemade.  I struggled between 3 and 4 stars.  Based just on the food, I'd say 4 stars.  But given the odd location, the fact that not everything on the menu was available (no chicken sandwich, which I was craving) and the cost (even for homemade food I thought it was a bit pricey) I landed on 3 stars.    If you're interested in giving it a try, I'd recommend taking advantage of the deal on www.Restaurant.com.  You can get $10 and $25 gift certificates.  Well worth it if you're not sure if you'll like it but want to try some good fried chicken."}
{"text":"I had just finished decorating my Christmas tree and I was looking for something cozy for dinner. BBQ is my absolute favorite, so when I saw it was on GrubHub, I decided to try it out. I recently moved to Manchester and I'm still learning the local establishments. I ordered the ribs, yams/apples, and corn bread. The sauce on the ribs is really good with just the right amount kick and smoke.  They melted in your mouth with just the right amount of char on the end hat reminded me of burnt ends on brisket. The yams were spiced in a way that felt perfect for post-Christmas decorating.  Another reviewer mentioned the cornbread. Yes! Next time I need to try the fried chicken and greens. I like to support my fellow Northside neighbors, so thank you for giving me a late dinner that will have me coming back."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff. I called at 9 pm to order takeout. The lady said that the kitchen was closed. I told her, \"I thought you guys were open until 9.\" She replied with \"Yes but tonight we're closing early.\" No explanation, no sorry, NOTHING! I then began to say that they should really display those changes on Yelp or their website. She hung up on me.   The previous time I called for takeout and they were out of four of my six items. No apology from the staff member. Completely rude and acted like I was an inconvenience.   I will not be coming back here, which is a shame because I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Five meals were just ordered, the wings were salty, the greens and green beans taste like water, the instant mashed potatoes were dry, cheese for the macaroni and cheese was bland and we all just about chocked on the dry cornbread muffins, oh and the fish, was that even Cod foreal...."}
{"text":"Fantastic Chicken!! I'm not much of a Fried Chicken guy, but when you tag it as \"Party Fried\" Ill try it.. Breast was big and juicy, the wings were huge, the fried part was a party! Ate every piece!.. If you want wings, not like one of those Kids meal .35cent ones, this is the place.. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times.  1) The first time, I arrived at 9:45 p.m. on a Sunday night. Despite Yelp (and website hours) saying that they were open until midnight, the woman told me that she had shut down the kitchen and wasn't cooking anything new, so I left. [Update: I submitted to Yelp to update the hours, so now it says that they are open until 10 p.m.]  2)The second time I ordered a chicken strips meal (as I hate meat on the bone) with French fries and a cornbread muffin. The chicken strips were OK; the seasoning was weak, the meat was slightly dry, but there was A LOT of meat! I felt like each one was at least half the size of a full chicken breast. And the cornbread muffin was absolutely phenomenal!!!  3) The third time I stopped by at, like, 6:45 p.m. with the intent of trying the highly-recommended sweet potatoes and apples with a chicken strips meal, --with a cornbread muffin, of course!--but this time the woman told me that they weren't serving chicken strips as they hadn't thawed any that day. What?! They just decided that no one was gonna get an advertised food that entire day? To me, that's a bit messed up.  The service seemed curt and somewhat unapologetic the first and third times I was there. The second time, it was decent--the bare minimum that you should expect--but it's not like the woman was super friendly or anything. I'm confused by the reviews where people say they had fantastic service. I'm not creepy or rude or anything.  If there was a KFC or Popeyes close-by, I'd probably not give them another chance, but as it is, it is one of the only food places open within walking later in the evening . . . I don't know. When winter is over, I'd probably instead just walk the mile to the fast food places near the Allegheny T station instead. That's sad, because I'd really prefer to patronize local small establishments like Quik-It Chicken instead. But even if customer service at Taco Bell sucks, at least they'll be open when they say they will, and they'll have the food available that's on the menu."}
{"text":"Arrived around 2:45 PM in the place was empty. I ordered a three-piece, the meat was dry and was not hot. The best thing about the meal was the cornbread which was hot. The restrooms are disgusting. I will not be back"}
{"text":"Shoulda done my research.  I had very little time between meetings to order and then eat my lunch. I found this place  through Uber Eats. Since I'd never heard of it, I thought \"cool, a small business with homemade food and the menu looks amazing\". I ordered quickly and then moved on to my next task.   When it was delivered, I was really excited to try everything. Ribs, greens, baked beans, cornbread muffin, and, I was the lucky recipient of mashed potatoes that I didn't order, even better! (or so I thought)   When it came time to eat, it was a much different story. The bbq sauce wasn't great, although the ribs were pretty tender. The mashed potatoes were a strange consistency, definitely not homemade. What really got to me was that everything had a strange after taste. And it was the same flavor across everything. I can't figure out what it might have been, it was more \"chemical\" than herb or spice. At first it didn't seem too bad, but a few minutes into my meal, it became overwhelming to me and I just couldn't do it anymore. Ended up throwing the rest out. Although the food is gone, the taste is still lingering.  Just had a quick moment to stop and check out Yelp to see if maybe this was a one-off issue? From reading other reviews, I didn't see anyone reporting the same thing so maybe it's usually different or it's just my personal preference (I'm by no means a picky eater though and rarely give less than stellar reviews). However, it made sense to see that it came out of a gas station because it tasted like it came out of a gas station.   Sorry, I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Best soul food in pittsburgh straight-up. Cheap, delicious and fast.  The cornbread muffins are fire."}
{"text":"He has the best chicken. Honestly everything is good. I drove 45 minutes to get it. I ordered a rib dinner combo with greens and Mac n cheese. You get a piece of pie with your meal and it was great. It was well worth the drive. Might go tomorrow just to get some chicken!!!"}
{"text":"This is a gas station and NOT a restaurant. Chicken cooked in burnt oil and taste horrible. Went to two locations only to discover the first one was not a mistake. It's in a run down gas station. Would not recommended to anyone. Not worth the $34 cab fare."}
{"text":"I wasn't too satisfied just recently. Which I'm sad to report. Everything tasted so seasonless, especially the sides. The greens tasted like it was just boiled in water. And the stuffing was extremely runny. The chicken was, eh ok. I was very disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Their bbq is absolutely fantastic. The right amount of smoke flavor, falling off the bone meat, no gristle or fat. The fries were tasty and crispy.   This was my wife and my first time trying here. We ordered through UberEATS.   Uber screwed our order up the first time by not sending it through. After calling the restaurant, they were extremely helpful and got right on our order.   The cons, for me, come down to my preference. I personally like a thicker red beans and rice, and a little more bbq sauce on my ribs. But that's me. Everything else was perfect.   I hope one day they have brisket. It's been a very long time since I had a good BBQ brisket, and I feel like they would knock it out of the park.   We will be ordering from them again. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken and nicest owner in pittsburgh. @QuikItChicken  #quikitchicken.  Really.  Amazing food.   I love this Place, and the staff are so generous and kind.   Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"From mac and cheese to beans to yams, to the ribs and wings, there's more than one reason to visit Quik-It Chicken. Prices for everything are extremely reasonable. The owner is awesome, friendly, and devoted to his fare. The food is always piping hot and delicious, fresh or as leftovers. Ignore the location and focus on the food. Whenever I am near the North Side - or not :) - this is my go to place for soul food."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed by my first order from Quik-it! I'd been dying try them since I'd moved to the North Side and had heard friends rave about their chicken. My sister and brother-in-law were coming over, so I placed an order on Grubhub around 3pm, to be delivered at 6. At 5:40 I got a call from Grubhub saying that Quik-it was out of ribs, so they'd canceled by order altogether. I called the restaurant directly to try to get something else in place of the ribs (we had about $80 worth of food ordered). There was no manager available, though the nice woman said I could place a new order on Grubhub, just without ribs (and a few other things they were out of). I went back to Grubhub and was told the restaurant is not taking orders at this time. I really tried, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. I won't order from Quik-it again."}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever going here and that food was so delicious. It has that home cook taste and i really love the chili and bake beans."}
{"text":"I'v stopped here 2 different times. The first time I got wings and a side of mac n cheese  to eat there and it was really great.Every thing was hot, the mac n cheese was creamy and cheesy and  the wings were crispy and fresh, yum.  The next time I stopped in I wanted a large order to take home for my family. It took them an hour and a half to make me the chicken. There was over a dozen people come in and pick up their food as I sat and waited. Since you pay when you order I just had to wait. I asked to talk to a manager but the guy told me he wasn't there. The people in the back laughed so I think he was the manager. So I finally got my food and have never been back. No food is worth being disrespected like that."}
