{"text":"My experience was lovely.  Classic steak house feel, wonderful,attentive bartenders  (Derek and Brad) and lovely host (Jennifer). Clean, nice feel, DELICIOUS meatballs. Live music, not the bessssst, but fine. Overall, nice comfy feeling."}
{"text":"Had a good steak, a side and a glass of wine = $100.  If you're looking for a place to impress you guest or try to close a big deal, this is it."}
{"text":"Can I say rib eye? I was a bit jealous when I saw the boys' rib eye some out and started to drool. Fortunately it was too much food for 2 men, so I was able to steal a piece. It was cooked perfectly, and melted in my mouth. I ordered the ahi tuna. This fish was crusted in blackened sesame seeds, with the most delicious sauce drizzled over it. Our sides for the table were broccolini, asparagus, and scalloped potatoes. The veggies were perfectly crisp, and the calorie packed potatoes are to die for!"}
{"text":"I've been sitting here 2 hours and we've eaten our appetizer and when we finished the bread arrived. We are a table of 16 with reservations and no menses for 40 minutes. The waitress was good but one person wasn't enough for a table this big. With reservations at 8pm we won't eat until 11pm. In a down economy and very expensive restaurant I would expect exceptional service and not the case. Very disappointing. Not worth the $45 steak with one side d"}
{"text":"I keep coming back here.  Every year I eat here on my birthday because I know I won't be disappointed.  The service is amazing, the decor is very nice and classic, and the food is to die for.  If you want a really good steak I don't think there is anywhere better in the city.  The problem is that everything else on the menu is delicious too, so it's really hard to choose.  Luckily the sides are built for sharing.  The truffle mac and cheese and the lobster mashed potatoes are both must-haves.  I don't care if you're on a low carb diet, forget it when you come to Vintage.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the place.    It's pricey, but well worth what you are paying for the quality of food you get.  Also the jazz band is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Food was passable but horribly disappointed in the service. Our server was robotic and lackluster while explaining the meat cuts, acted like he wasn't even interested in being there. ?Manager in suit walked around to tables and asked how everything was to everyone except us. Happen to be (the only) young Asian couple.. suspect.  Will not be returning and will advise friends of the same."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! This is one of the best places to eat in Calgary! Spend an evening here!!!"}
{"text":"Vintage is something of a mixed bag.  It was my first time to this restaurant and had expectations of a fantastic dining experience.  The evening unfolded the following way:  1. Reservation was for 8:45 and was asked to sit at the bar (which was full) for 20 minutes as our table was not ready. 2. Following our orders being placed (coctails to start, one prime ribeye, one filet and a glass of wine with my steak), incorrect food orders (I assume for other tables) were brought to our table.  This occured twice. 3. Received our steaks which were cooked to perfection.  It is one of the best steaks I have ever had (prime ribeye)!  A thin cut, but a fantastic crust, and somehow cooked a perfect medium rare. 4.  Did not receive my wine with my meal, waiter had forgotten, so I had to reorder and received wine half way through my meal. 5. Received the bill which included ~$60 in alcohol that we did not order.  It was removed.  Any one item above would not be worth mentioning, but all together detracted from the dining experience.   Hoping my second visit will be better.  The steaks are spectacular."}
{"text":"Vintage Chop House, stands out as a premiere chop/steak house in all meaning of the word... Ambiance is quite taking and not overly crowded seating, the table next to you is not going to get any gossip as each table (at least where we were sitting) gives a group plenty of elbow room.  The food was slow to come, but was to perfection (take all the time you want and truly believe that they do this to make the night with friends even more special, so you can spend more time with a smile on your face), the sides are À la carte, but make sure you order each side for at least two or more people, as they are big portions. I could go for ever on the food, but I think that there food is well spoke for in other reviews, I will say, darn good job Vintage, darn good job indeed.  Prices are high and drinks are overly high, but we had no issue at all with the pricing, as everything was worth every penny spent, a great welcoming evening with friends and a staff that help make it that way... Do not pass the chance to spend a friend filled evening or your most important romantic end of a special day at the chop house it is as good as they say.   The only issue of the night, that turned out to be a non-issue was there soda (mix) unit was not working, according to the waite staff, they ran down the street to Mac's and bought up all the mix needed with a very minimal interruption to the night, offered another cocktail in the place of that ordered, and we did not even notice... Why put this in the review if it was a non-issue, to show that they will make sure you night is perfect, even though issues arise."}
{"text":"Food is as always phenomenal. Great service. Came here with my boyfriend. They seated us in this private table that wasn't out in the open. Definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Excellent. Best spot for a date, or taking clients out. Fantastic food. Has a real 'Mad Men' feel to the restaurant. I have never been disappointed with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I don't consider myself to be a \"foodie\" by any means but I can say this, WOW!  Service was amazing, the ambiance was incredibly cool yet sophisticated, and the food itself was incredible.  Our drinks took a little time to get to our table, however our sever was very attentive and was sure to bring us water and finished taking our order promptly.  The speed at which we received our food was very impressive.  We started out with crab cakes to share- get them! - and just as our empty plate was taken away our main courses arrived immediately. The prices are high but you certainly get what you pay for.  I don't have a negative thing to say about this place. Will definitely be back in the near future! Great place to take prospective clients as well."}
{"text":"Waste time and money in the worst restaurant ever! Stay away! They are rude and arrogant, and the food was average, the price to high. Worst experience of my life"}
{"text":"For the price point, we expected the service and food to be better than experienced. The waitress was very nice; however, she was too busy to manage our table. I had the double cut pork chop and she warned me that it was large. It was large but 50% fat so not that much left over. The brine contains fennel, which is not my favorite, so the flavor was not as enjoyable for me and not on the menu description.  The asparagus was undercooked and had a raw, bland flavor. On the bright side, my husband liked his tenderloin steak and the scalloped potatoes. The creamed spinach was also flavorful and served 2 people.  We finished our meal and sat with the plates for such a long time that we asked another server for dessert menus. She took pity and also cleared the table. Not great service for a traditional chophouse. It was not an awful meal, just not one that I would repeat"}
{"text":"I've had business lunches here on a number of occasions and I've never been disappointed. The food is consistently good and is usually promptly served by attentive and attractive staff. A great wine list although somewhat pricy. All in all, it's always a pleasure dining at Vintage! A big thank you to Sarah who served us today!"}
{"text":"I've tried every steak place in Calgary, been to various places in US and Canada.  Have to say Vintage is still my number one place when it comes to their Rib Eye (I cannot bring myself to order anything else).  My opentable profile would awe anyone on how many times I've dined at this great steakhouse!  The staff has always been good and the ambiance is exactly what I look for, fits the bill with dining with friends in the  lounge bar side, and having dinner with the wife or family on the other..great ambiance, and did I mention the Rib Eye (med rare)...actual perfection!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful inside and has a cozy atmosphere.  Service was great and included a talk about the different cuts of meat available which was very informative. Extensive wine list.   We had the scallops which were amazing - perfectly cooked and flavorful, followed by the butcher's block cut (market price) and ahi tuna with truffle mac and cheese, bacon scalloped potatoes, and beets. The meat was fantastic and melt in your mouth (according to boyfriend). I had the tuna, which I didn't have huge expectations for at a steakhouse, but it was delicious as well. The beets and truffle mac and cheese were yummy and satisfying, but would skip the bacon scalloped potatoes next time.   No live music when we went (which I'm grateful for) and overall was worth the bigger price."}
{"text":"I can't believe how badly this restaurant dropped the ball, it's as if they have completely given up on providing exceptional customer service, and expertly prepared food... Yikes... when there are so many fabulous restaurants popping up every day in Calgary, it wouldn't surprise me if they closed their doors tomorrow..  We were at the Vintage Chophouse to celebrate a 50th Birthday, there were 16 in our group, and 15 of us ordered their steak expecting to have an amazing food experience. Based on the price, a person would expect exceptional service, which was not the case... Our waiter seemed to take drink orders 2 at a time. We waited an hour and a half for our meal... our apetizer was a lightly flavoured water disguised as French onion soup. When asked how much longer the meal was going to take an hour and a half in...our waiter \"Justin\" made no opoligies and said that our timing was bad and the kitchen was slammed and our main course will more than likely arrive later rather than sooner.. Alas our meal arrives and wouldn't ya know it there wasn't a steak in the room that was remotely warm!! Yup 27 bucks for a cold steak placed in the middle on a nice white plate... The only food that was hot was the scalloped potatoes which were very yummy. So if you are in the mood for some great scalloped potatoes go to Vintage, but if your in the mood for an expertly prepared steak leave it to the experts at Ruth Chris, or Char Cut.  We left the restaurant feeling completely violated having to pay for such all around bad experience....I vowed to spread the word."}
{"text":"One of Calgary's best places to get a steak, hands down. They are quite expensive but you are getting what you pay for The wine-list is large and well rounded and if you're not sure then the waiter will provide  a recommendation. The appetizers are simply amazing with the mussels being the Pièce de résistance (they taste the same as mussels you would get at a nice restaurant on the coast.) and finally the steak is tender and juicy and not to mention done exactly as you ordered it. I only go here about once a year but I relish it every time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went  here for the first time tonight on my birthday. We had Michael as our waiter..he was attentive, funny, knowledgeable and super nice. The service was awesome and the food was amazing. I can't go back to regular steak. I had the 14oz rib eye steak, perfectly done in medium  and a side of mac and cheese. We also had onion rings and scalloped potatoes and baked alaska for dessert. The  experience and ambience made me a very happy birthday girl. Our waiter even made me a complimentary non alcoholic Shirley temple ..he was so attentive to know I didn't like alcohol..how awesome us that? and I received free key lime pie because it was my birthday. I'm definitely coming back and bringing all my friends. The price is higher than most steak places but the quality of the food and the service make it worthwhile. It was an epic meal experience. Thank you Michael...you made my birthday even better with the fantastic customer service. I will most definitely recommend vintage chophouse to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Our team voted on having our lunch at Vintage and I'm so glad we did! We received quality service from the moment we entered the restaurant until we slowly shuffled our way out from an amazing meal.  We started with the tiger prawns with cocktail sauce and the calamari - both were delish! The prawns were huge and came adorned on a giant martini glass.  To accompany all our steaks, we got onion rings, broccolini, spinach gratin, asparagus and sautéed mushrooms to share.  It was a bit of a wait for our food (granted it was peak lunch time and we had a table of 6) but it was totally worth it. My steak was cooked to perfection and all the sides were so tasty! I kept eating even though I was beyond stuffed.  My ultimate weakness is crème brule, so even though I was clearly entering a food coma I couldn't pass on dessert. Luckily I was able to twist my coworker's arm into splitting one with me. The almond and pistachio biscotti that came with the brule was TO.DIE.FOR. Our server was even kind enough to pack me a to-go box filled with the biscotti!   Is this place pricey? For sure. But the food and service quality make it worth it!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes based on reviews. I walked in with a party of 5 and had a cold reception from the host who just led us to a table in the corner and walked away without confirming if the location was OK.(the restaurant was not even close to full we arrived about an hour and a bit before closing.) The waitress came and took drink orders after about 15 minutes. She got my friends wine and mine backwards. I ordered a cab sav and my friend a malbec, quite distinct flavours. I also know the brand I ordered quite well as I have that brand and series in stock at home. When I pointed out that our drinks were backwards and we had already sipped from the glasses ( also the wines arrived poured from the bar.) The waitress began to condescendingly explain while eye rolling what a cab sav should taste like. She then said she would replace our wines which arrived another 15 minutes later. Our food arrived 5 minutes before closing time about 50 minutes after ordering. And the steaks were cold. We didn't see our waitress again until she came and dropped off the bill. The manager was gone so I just told whoever was at the front to check there staff because our experience was inexcusable. This restaurant is like a white BMW. Super nice looking on the outside but you know its chalked full of douche on the inside."}
{"text":"Had a great Wedding Anniversary experience last night. Food was amazing and our server Louie was outstanding. He was engaging, attentive and made a fantastic recommendations on wine. Menu has a delicious selection of appetizers and the Rib Eye was cooked to perfection. Great atmosphere/ambiance in the dinning room for a special night for 2. Try the lounge if dinning room isn't your thing.   A definite recommend and great representation for a YYC Steakhouse."}
{"text":"I had a evening meal here on my first visit to Calgary from the UK Nov 2009  Arts Hotel reception staff recomended it to me.  It was just a short walk from the hotel.  I ate there mid week and I must say the food and ambiance are both first rate.  The staff were helpful curtious and very efficent. I've mever before seen waiters and their managment \"runing\" to serve customers through out the 2 hours I was there. A bit on the expensive side but realy very very good. I will be going back in January 2010 with my pal from Houston Tx  Oh a word of caution this area and that around Arts Hotel appears to attract more than its fair share of down and outs.  These men and women seem to go out of their way to irritate people around them. Beware.....  Rgds Michael"}
{"text":"Great spot! The steaks are always cooked to perfection. The accompanying sides are mouth watering. I love the New York strip. The wine list goes on forever and the sommelier is always helpful in picking out the right one. This place is  great for a special night out or just because! Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Soup of the day was a broccoli soup that was served cold. Beef tartare was ok but a bit salty, same with the scallops. Steak tasted good but was paired with cold mashed potatoes and cold asparagus. Not at all impressed with Vintage."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner a few days ago. The five stars says it all.  The service was great. The staff were attentive but not too uptight.  The decor was a little more upscale than I expected. We were dressed pretty casual but we still felt comfortable.  Now lets get to the good part... the food! We had oysters casino for an appy. I've never tried oysters before but damn Vintage, you made me like them!  For our main course we had 10 oz New York with mashed potatoes, asparagus, and crab on the side. Let me start by saying I'm not crazy about red meat, but I heard that vintage had the best steak in town so I gave it a try. I was absolutely blown away by how perfect it was, especially with the red wine sauce. Everything else was so delicious, I would have had more if I weren't so full already.  Of course we had to save room for desert. Ever had baked alaska before? At Vintage its to die for.  Vintage, I'd visit you every week if I could afford you. Instead I'll have to settle for another special occasion but believe me, I'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"I was here with a friend for Big Taste lunch and was sorely disappointed in the service received. We've both been here before so we're familiar with the type of service at this establishment but it did not met expectations that day. Our reservation was past peak lunch time however the restaurant was still very busy and people were still coming and going. We waited a very long time inbetween our appetizer and main course. When our steak frites arrived my friend asked for ketchup when the server asked if he could bring us anything else. Well, no one returned with ketchup. Clearly we were forgotten. The creme brûlée for dessert was strangely buttery which is odd for creme brûlée since it's not made with butter. The service that day was definitely off. The server was not friendly and didn't offer anything to make the experience memorable. The appetizer and main course were good but dessert was a miss."}
{"text":"A plastic and shallow imitation of a real steakhouse.  We've eaten in many steakhouses across Canada and the US. This is a sad and superficial restaurant. Save your calories--and your cash--by eating somewhere else.  The iceberg lettuce salad was covered in pudding-like dressing. Iceberg lettuce salad is such a trendy item these days. Either serve a classic version, or be inventive. The chef offered neither. The soup was cold and the seafood appetizer was like eating defrosted fish from your grocer's freezer.  As was the steak. Costco frozen meat tastes better than what they had on offer. However. the Vintages Steak Sauce is a lovely interpretation of a well-balanced steak sauce (Worcestershire, tomato, Tabasco sauce, oil and other ingredients).  The service was poor. The hallmark of any steakhouse is the old-fashioned service. Here, you'll find plastic service that is uneven, inattentive.  The other reviews on this page seem very positive. We're out-of-towners and don't have any nostalgia for this establishment. I think that if you like to drink a lot (they do have a great wine list) and are being taken out for a business lunch (and therefore will never complain)--or you are expensing the meal (and so, you really don't care what you eat), this is an acceptable place to eat. However, if you are expecting a classic steakhouse--go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary tonight. Excellent service and incredible food and drinks. Will be coming back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't judge, but our menu for 2 was: - wedge salad - chicken fried lobster - prime rib - truffle mac and cheese  - mushrooms - a side of bernaise and bread - and a baked Alaska  Probably not a lot there that we wouldn't order again. Good sized portions which assured we would leave there full.   Service was really fast, but it was oddly quiet there for a Friday night. Service was really friendly and helpful in giving recommendations."}
{"text":"This place was one of the best steaks I have had.  All Canada Prime Beef (superior to USA Prime in my opinion) Great Ladero Wine - great Sommelier and even better wait staff, about the best I have ever experienced (Waiter was Andy)  Appetizers were awesome - Escargot and Tuna Tartare, can't beat it.  Overall one of the best places I have been in the world."}
{"text":"I love Vintage - one of my favorite steakhouses on the more expensive side. Worth the price though - the steak is always fantastic, as I've been more than once. The service I've received is always great, with a friendly waiter and informative meat speech. All the food is well prepared and tastes wonderful, full flavors. The restaurant itself is fairly large, pleasant looking, with good lighting. I haven't been when there is live music, but I find it quiet. Overall happy with this place!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what the haters here are all about, I come from a 'cow town' where I am seldom happy with beef I get in other places. That was not the case here, having a 14oz rib-eye cooked to perfection. My service was great, the lobster mashed potatoes were amazing. The Caesar salad was good, skip the espresso (it was terrible).  Overall I would certainly return here."}
{"text":"Vintage is an excellent lunch and dinner establishment with great food, wine list and service. Great menu selections, with steak being the house specialty.   Vegeterians won't be disappointed as the fish is fabulous and the salads you can order at lunch will keep you satisfied. The restaurant has a high end bar area with a full menu and live music some evenings.  A great place to take clients, spouse or date. There is also a private room for larger groups."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews of others showed that they were very inconsistent.  I almost didn't go, but decided to anyway.   For most of the meal, it was an excellent decision.  Unlike many others, I found the seating process and the waiter to be friendly and attentive.  We decided not to have an appetizer and save ourselves for dessert.   BTW they have an excellent wine list and we ordered a decently priced Pomerol.  Also, we ordered the Rib Chop for two, mid rare, and sides of fingerling potatoes and carrots along with a demi sauce.  The wine was awesome.  The Rib Chop was cooked perfectly and one of the best steaks I've ever had.  The potatoes were cooked with duck fat and were delicious.   For some reason, instead of carrots we received beets, but they were excellent.   The Demi never arrived and we didn't ask for it as we didn't want to wait on it.   All was fine as the food was so great!   But these small flaws could cause others not to enjoy themselves.  So why the low rating?   The dessert.   We ordered a chocolate brownie with peanut butter topping.   The whipped peanut topping was great but the brownie was disgusting.   There was nothing brownie about it.  And not much chocolate about it either.   My wife took one bite and decided it was undercooked.   I marshaled on not wanting to give up as I rarely leave a chocolate crumb.   Made it half way.   The 'brownie' was three dense disks that tasted like bad, uncooked, almost tasteless dough.  If the owner or chef had ever tasted this item it would not be on the menu.   First dessert I've ever been disgusted by.    Terrible end to an otherwise great dinner."}
{"text":"Want to hear something funny? I went to the Vintage Chophouse full well knowing that they have nothing vegetarian on their menu and guess what? I had one of my all-time favourite vegetarian meals here. Weird eh?  A bunch of friends and I went over this weekend and when the waitor came by and found out I was a vegetarian, he just smiled and said no problem. He went and talked to the Chef and they custom-made me one of the most delicious meals I've ever had!  What I noticed most was that their ingredients were ridiculously fresh, and the fact that the service was some of the best I've ever experienced, made Vintage one of my all-time favourite fine dining experiences in Calgary.  I know it's funny, but the next time your vegetarian friend says 'Yes, Vintage Chophouse is one of my favourite restaurants in the city', you may want to laugh, but trust me, I'm right there with 'em."}
{"text":"From start to finish the meal and experience here was 5 stars.  When you sit down you notice your napkin is folded like a tuxedo, which was such a unique touch I had to mention it.  Service is fast and impeccable! They bring a board by with all the cuts of meat on it and go over each one with you, which just makes your mouth water all the more. The only negative thing I can say is that the dressing on the beet salad is way too sweet but otherwise delicious if you avoid the greens with said dressing. My prime rib was cooked to medium-rare perfection and if that wasn't amazing enough all the sides are sharable portions so you get to try everything!!!  This maybe just me but I was overjoyed to go to a restaurant where the patrons dressed above nice-casual which greatly added to the experience of a nice meal out. Hands down my new and possibly only place to go for steak in Calgary"}
{"text":"Yum, yum...definitely somewhere added to my favorites list.  Sexy ambiance, perfect for a cozy date with someone you want to spend time with.  Wait staff are fantastic and first rate!"}
{"text":"I think reading all the hype may have bolstered this place to such lofty expectations that I was bound to be let down by reality.  While I wasn't let down, I can't give it 5 stars.    Overall the food was good and the service was awesome but unfortunately, now that I've had the best steak of my life (Wallister Stube in Lake Louise), nothing else quit lives up to comparison even this tender, juicy, perfectly seared tenderloin.    That said, the place is definitely worth a visit.  I would stay away from the oysters as an appetizer though as it was too salty but the seared scallops?  The bomb!  And the tomato salad was refreshing and cleaned the palate before the steak arrived.    I tried something called a Canadian Apple for a cocktail and these people are serious about their alcohol.  It almost knocked me on my tush.  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  The ribeye steaks were cooked perfectly.  The beets and fingerling potatoes with duck confit were delicious, but the waiter, although attentive, was not all that friendly; and came off as quite pretentious.  When we asked if he had Ripasso wine he said he had no Chianti Ripasso.  I always thought there was Valpolicella Ripasso, never Chianti.  He said yes, it's Chianti Ripasso, and Ripasso refers to the region the wine is from.  When I told him I thought it referred to the process of the way the wine was made he said no.  Look it up!  I guess I'm not a connoisseur, and I wasn't so irked by the fact he thought he was right and I was wrong, I just didn't like the way he presented himself which is too bad because the food is good."}
{"text":"Steak was great! Shrimp were huge and very tasty. Oysters are VERY good. Escargot was the worst I have ever had I don't know what they were thinking when they put this on the menu. Service on restaurant side was terrible in lounge great music and service"}
{"text":"Ended up here because local pub was full for a sports game and was very happy. Ordered rib eye with roasted mushrooms and the taste and quality was amazing. Staff very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Vintage was one of those treat-yourself-because-you-deserve-it kind of places. On an trip to Calgary with friends on our way to Banff, we decided that we wanted to treat ourselves to Vintage and enjoy famous Alberta beef. With its swanky interior, we did feel a little out of place, but nonetheless, we were greeted and treated very well.   FOOD: Lobster Mac and Cheese. Rib Eye. Prime Rib. Roasted Mushrooms. Sauteed Asparagus. Now let us say this was definitely an extravagant meal on our part, but luckily with the strong USD, the meal turned out to be affordable on the pocket, and great on the taste! The chophouse cuts are spectacular. Cooked to perfection (that nice medium rare), it was tender, fresh, and just got that right texture to it. The sides that can come along with, our favorite was the roasted mushrooms. There is something in those mushrooms that are to die for. For the Mac and Cheese, although not the star of the meal, it was definitely worth getting that kind of side to further indulge all of those taste buds.   SERVICE: Oh that Canadian demeanor is always refreshing compared to our American curtness.   Vintage is one of those Canadian steak establishments that is worth every dollar."}
{"text":"This is my third time at vintage and it never disappoints!! I had the 10oz prime rib, truffle mac and cheese and broccolini. The prime rib was cooked to perfection served with a very spicy but real horseradish. The truffle mac and cheese was very rich as expected but was incredibly good. Broccolini was ordered just to add some veggie to the meal. Service was great, our drinks were ordered and served promptly. We had the chocolate molton cake for dessert as the carrot cheesecake was sold out for the evening. It definitely didn't compare to Joeys or Cactus club's molten cake but it was still good. Definitely try vintage for steak if you haven't. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"PERFECTION!! We have been here 3 times now and it has been exceptional everytime. We each ordered the 14oz Ribeye with the side asparagus and truffle oil mac n cheese. I have never had a steak that good in my life and thats saying something special! The sides were terrific...really miss the bone marrow mashed potatoes they had on the menu last year, sounds scary- but trust me- YUM! The wine selection is great and for dessert we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Hand down the best dessert, we are still talking/dreaming about it today. Very pricey but worth it for special occasions. Service was excellent, def a good idea to make a reservation, esp on the weekends.Cant wait to go back in June!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. We wanted to try Alberta beef and a few people had recommended this place. The waitress was knowledgeable about the food and wine. My steak was tender and flavourful.    We had asked about the different cuts of meats, and got a very clear explanation, accompanied by the actual cuts of meat. This was the first time I've had this presented so clearly. We were told about everything from the best flavoured meats, and the temperatures that the meats should be cooked at.   I ordered the New York strip after the chef's cut (Canadian Waygu) was all sold out. This was super disappointing. So I recommend ordering this first if you get the chance. The sides are all served family style and they have great selection. It's good to try different side dishes and share them amongst the table. I would recommend upgrading for the truffle macaroni. I also really enjoyed the beets.   If you are looking for good Alberta steak go here."}
{"text":"We came in here for lunch with friends as we were driving through town and looking for a good Albertan steakhouse.  We were promptly seated and given no I'll feelings towards our appearance (tired and in very comfortable clothing, a bit out of place among the downtown business crowd) Food did not arrive as quickly as The Keg, from my experience,  but the steaks were cooked properly (I'm a medium-rare gal, and more often than not it turns out medium) and tasted great. We each ordered different cuts but were all satisfied. My bearnaise sauce, served on the side, was cold and had that film sauce gets when it's been sitting and chilled. Others ordered the peppercorn sauce and it was 'okay but not enough peppery bite to it'.  Sides are served family style, so it was nice that we were able to share the mashed potatoes (smooth, good), mushrooms (divine!), and jalapeño creamed corn (good taste but no jalapeño kick to it).  Great wine selection, promo service, and a fairly attentive waitress. I'd recommend to friends passing through town."}
{"text":"Hooray for tasty food! My tuna steak was perfectly done and came with a side of incredibly tasty beets (including golden beets!). My companion has celiac as well as nut allergies and had no trouble finding many tasty options available on the menu. The staff were all excellent and attentive; I will be back."}
{"text":"We had been excited to try! Finally got to on a Friday night with resos. It was quite busy when we arrived and had to wait at the front door for at least 20 min for our table. A little awkward as there is nowhere really to stand while you wait.   The restaurant itself is quite nice and when we finally were seated, we were glad to be more in the interior, up on the second level. We waited another 20 min at least for our server to come by even just to fill our water glasses. He so obviously had been on break. It happens, but we found him to be flip, curt and not super helpful about the menu when he was at our table. The service for Vintage almost downgraded the stars to a 3 overall but wow, the food here was good and made up for it. We were glad for the choice of coming here in the end. We started with the Caesar salad which I have to tell you maybe have been the best of its kind I have ever had. Double smoked bacon, crisp, cool lettuce/lemon wedge with just the right amount of dressing and not too many croutons. Perfect. And large. We also got the escargot which comes in a brown gravy sauce in a little ramekin with brioche for dipping.  This too was very good. Rich but delicious.  We also got little sourdough rolls on the table, complimentary. You could tell these were \"end of the night rolls\" but they were the perfect size and the sourdough  taste really came through. They would have been a 5/5 had they been warmer and fresher. We of course came here for steak. The 10oz Prime Rib starts at $29 and if you want any other type of steak it jumps to $44. Not having an expense account of any kind for this evening's dinner, we each went with the Prime Rib. Med Rare is the rarest we could have it so that was our choosing. The sides... YUM. I love how you can pick a side to go with your meal here. Not like other places where all those are separate from the meat. We opted for the asparagus and the onion rings. Oh, the onion rings, thanks to another reviewer here on Yelp that raved about them, THANK YOU x 1000! They were so good, quite possibly THE best onion rings I have ever had. Huge, well seasoned and crispy. 6 to an order and the asparagus was well cooked and plentiful too for sharing. The Prime Rib served in its own jus cut through like butter and we were happy with all of our choices. We for sure had leftovers. We had a beer and glass of wine respectively and no complaints about these offerings.  The music playing was - odd to say the least. No top 40 here, no classic rock, I am not sure what it was. But, we were happy to see a band was setting up for live music. Our server seemingly wanted to get out of there so he packed up our food to go, did not ask us about dessert and proceeded to bring us the bill. The credit machine automatically asks you for a 20% gratuity to be given even for 2 people.  Ya, not deserved tonight. We were meeting friends below for a drink in the lounge after dinner.  WOW, you go down the stairs and into another world. From fine dining to a meet/meat market! The band was great and it appears that every Fri they have someone new playing. I thought from what I read on line that they played Jazz here Fri nights but this is no longer so!  We would perhaps come back here for a delicious dinner and give the service another go but may try another lounge afterwards for a different, less obvious hook-up scene. DEF: Meet market or meat market, is an originally pejorative term referring to two related phenomena: a location or activity in which people are viewed as commodities and a business like a nightclub where people typically look for a casual sex partner."}
{"text":"Phenomenal steak, great service and awesome drinks. Will be back there again. Definitely order the Mash potatoes with your steak as they go well together."}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary... it was just the two of us and it made for a perfect date night and celebration.  There wasn't anything about the evening I could complain about!!!  The food was amazing!!! The waiter we had was awesome... he was the perfect mix of knowledgeable and personable!! I loved the fact that the start your evening by coming around and showing and explaining the various steak cuts.. perfect for someone like me who isn't overly knowledgeable about the various cuts or how they are best prepared. And the atmosphere was very nice... not too loud do you couldn't talk... but also not too 'stuffy' so as you felt comfortable!  I would definitely recommend it.. especially for special occasions. It was a pleasant surprise of a perfect evening out!"}
{"text":"Vintage Chophouse is solid, but not anywhere close to what I would call \"the best steak I've ever had\".  First of all, my expectations were off because their lunch menu says that dinner options are available in addition to the special plates, burgers, etc that they offer at lunch.  So I went there wanting to try the short rib, but they don't serve that at lunchtime.  No problem, I ordered a tenderloin lunch and asked if I could get creamed spinach with that.  Nope, creamed spinach is only at dinner time.  Very strange.  So, definitely check this place out and see how it performs to your palate, but come at dinner time when the good stuff is being served."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Ambiance: 3.5/5 Overall experience: 3.5/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  I rarely pay more than 30 dollars for a steak, but it was my lucky day and I was treated to a business dinner. We went on a Tuesday and it was packed! Then again it was during Stampede week. Nonetheless, Vintage is large with seating in the dining area or lounge. There was nothing notable or unique about the decor - very contemporary with large cushy seats and dim lighting to \"set the mood\".  Our waiter was friendly and cheerful, made a few jokes here and there, yet was direct. Although Vintage serves a fair amount of seafood, they are well known for their steaks (someone mentioned they only buy the top 1% of AAA Alberta beef). Prior to ordering, each table gets a quick rundown of the different types of steaks the restaurant serves - C.A.B. Tenderloin, Canada prime NY strip, C.A.B prime rib, prime rib eye, or prime rib chop.   Our waiter brought out a wooden board filled with raw cuts of meat, and went through what each one was, where it was located in a cow, the taste, and how it should be prepared. This was also his time to present us with their special cut of the day. A very unique touch to the dining experience and helps steak newbies decide what to order.  Their menu consists of chilled seafood appetizers (~$15-$20): oysters, shrimp and lobster cocktail, and tuna tartar; Regular appetizers ($11-$20): onion soup, escargot, crab cakes, scallops, and beef tartar; salads; seafood pastas; and Seafood mains like lobster, salmon/halibut steak and tuna (~$34).   Expect to spend at least $40 for a 10oz steak with prices increasing for 14oz, 16oz, and 18oz cuts. Each steak includes your choice of a classic side which are perfect for sharing with a group of people. I guarantee you will leave feeling full!  I ordered their beef tartar which I highly recommend for anyone who hasn't tried the dish before. There was about 2-3oz portion of fresh finely cut raw beef with truffle, onions, a beautiful egg yolk on top, and a small pile of mixed greens on the side. You can eat it straight up or spread over the pieces of baguette they provide. It was divine... the flavours were well balanced, not overpowering, and you get a hint of beefy taste. Perfect for sharing too!  For the main I got a 8oz C.A.B Tenderloin ($37) medium rare. It was cooked perfectly with a beautiful smokey crust (not burnt) and the meat was velvety, melt in your mouth goooooood! The only negative is that they didn't let my meat rest long enough so there was a streak of blood on the plate and more juices came out when i cut in. It was still good nonetheless. Our table shared the following sides:   - onion rings: they were gi-normous! Salty and a little soggy. - bacon scalloped potatoes: perfect side to go with steak! - sauteed asparagus: perfectly tender and drenched in butter. - wild mushrooms: they were only okay...nothing special other than sauteed in butter. - creamed spinach gratin: I was confused with the gratin part but it was essentially creamed spinach which reminded me of baby food  Overall, the sides were a bit disappointing since the seasoning was a little off or they just drenched everything in butter and grease which was a little off putting.  I can't say much about the rest of their menu, but I certainly had an excellent time and the steak was delicious! I enjoyed the 'atmosphere' and it is definitely a nice place to take a group of friends to."}
{"text":"This is a meat lover's paradise. Our party went there because of the chophouse reputation and for a vegan or vegetarian there is little on the menu for you. The side dishes (we chose roasted mushrooms, beets, carmelized onions and scalloped potatoes) are served family style and while all very delicious, the chef has a heavy hand with oil. The hot rolls they serve before dinner are delicious. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great service but was not impressed with the steaks.  We had the ribeye, wagyu and sirloin and they were equivalent to \"choice\" in beef grade here in the USA.  The wagyu beef was should be well marbled and tender and it was not and the same with the ribeye. I have been to Japan, Texas, New York, Las Vegas and the San Francisco Bay Area restaurants that serve some of the best beef in the world and was expecting Calgary on par."}
{"text":"Me and my dad were very excited to try this restaurant and we didn't even get to. We were there for 45 minutes and had to walk out because our waitress completely ignored us and hadn't even taken our food order yet. We were in the lounge and it wasn't even that busy. Terrible experience, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the chowder and tuna tartare with avocado, both excellent, wine list is a little overpriced over other places by about an average of $10 per bottle  Service was great  Jazz in the background in the lounge  Must come back and try a steak one night"}
{"text":"Count on-able steak in Calgary. I have been hosting dinner here for groups large and small and the staff here executes flawlessly every time.  They know how to work groups doing business. I dined with a friend on a non-work night for dinner and the service was impeccable.  Steaks are always done perfectly and the side dishes were all excellent.  Chocolate Lava Cake is a must have to finish off the evening. Keep up the great work Vintage!!"}
{"text":"Second time here with friends. Great ambient, great service, good foods. A classy steak place for a night out and there is a live band after 9 pm later at night. Foods are a bit on the pricey side for the type of foods serve, its good but nothing really wow to me. The seafood plater is worth to try for a group party if you up for seafood. Would still come back for the odd occasion."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times over the years and recently enjoyed a Christmas supper with friends.  I have to say that the meal was great but the service was pretty slow.  We were a number of tables so I have to assume that the large (although scheduled) party must have been the reason for the slow service. I had steak, as did everyone at our table.  It was good.  So was the salad, the desert, the sides, everything.  Good. It was not cheap but if you ever get value at a downtown Calgary \"high-end\" restaurant I guess I feel I did."}
{"text":"I love thick steaks, big side dishes and stiff drinks.  You get it all here.  The star of the meal was the beef tartare appetizer.  A very big serving of beautifully seasoned, chopped steak with a raw egg cracked on top was stunningly beautiful and memorable to eat.  It is a dish that makes Vintage unique.  The 18 ounce rib-eye was thick, charred outside, bloody inside and heavily seasoned.  A steak eater will not be disappointed.  To me the drawback is that the prices are 10% to 15% higher  than other comparable, luxury steak houses in the city, so I can't give full marks even though it met all my expectations.  Calgary is a very competitive, luxury steak house market."}
{"text":"Overall, a positive experience.  However, Vintage seemed a bit more expensive than the other steak houses in the area.  The prime rib was acceptable - it was cooked appropriately, but under-seasoned, and definitely a bit cold.  The sides however (broccolini and mashed potatoes) were very nice, redeeming the prime rib to some extent."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant multiple times and everytime I've been here, the service and food have been nothing short of amazing! I was here with a large group of friends and each pair shared a bone-in ribeye. We all got ours rare and they were phenomenal! The side dishes we ordered were shared among the six of us and there was more than enough to go around. I love their service, quality of food, and the ambience!"}
{"text":"Superb service, atmosphere, steak cut variety, and lots of people that are interesting to watch. I had a great time. This fine steakhouse establishment most definitely complements Calgary.  I enjoyed one of the finest sauced steaks ever.  After dinner, we asked for and received a tour of this large restaurant. We saw a very distinguished corporate dining room and a great sequestered round table for 12.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fancy and expensive steakhouse but worth the $$$. There is lots of street parking available in front of the restaurant and on the entire street. There's also a paid parking lot available next to the restaurant.   Went with a group of friends and got to try a bit of everything. The steaks come with a classic side but the sides are family style which means they are good for sharing. Massive portions for sides like the lobster mashed potato.   Lobster truffle mac n cheese was one of the best I've ever tried! Just the perfect amount of cheesey goodness without being overwhelmingly greasy. I could've done without the lobster, I didn't feel it added much to the dish but I am also not a huge fan of lobster in general.   My tenderloin was great - cooked perfectly, medium rare as I requested. Really tender and juicy.   Other sides we tried were jalapeño creamed corn, bacon scalloped potatoes, beets, and onion rings. Mac n cheese was the best though.   We tried a variety of the desserts - cheesecake (blueberry that day), baked Alaska, creme brûlée and lemon meringue. Cheesecake is a very classic traditional cheesecake, nothing out of the ordinary. I was pleasantly surprised with how good the lemon meringue was; perfect amount of sweetness and tart from the lemons. The baked alaska looked very pretty and was different from typical desserts at most restaurants. But the creme brûlée here was one of the best I've ever had. Perfect creamy consistency without the weird pudding like texture that some places make. Seriously, if you love creme brûlée, try this place!  I understand that this place is definitely one of the more expensive places to dine at. However, I think the quality of the food here is amazing and that you really get what you pay for. Don't eat here if you are concerned about what your bill is gonna total up to. I can't frequent this place for the sake of my wallet but would definitely keep this place in mind for special occasions and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Heaven.  I don't always like to go to the most expensive place in town but when I do go to pricey places, I want to know my dollars are worth it.   If this restaurant is where vegetables and animals come to die, they die happy.  It's food heaven.  I'm not a huge meat fan.  I really enjoyed the sides.   Duck fat confit fingerling potatoes.  Jalapeño creamed corn.  Baby beets, and broccolini.    The waiter was delightful and suggested a very delicious wine.     I also had the half roasted cicken.  When I took my first bite my mouth watered so much, my friends saw me drooling.    This place is nuts during most of the year but if you g of the day after stampede it is dead as a door nail."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place in Calgary for a nice dinner!!!"}
{"text":"STEAK! My fav place to get my fav food.  Oh Vintage, where to start. I have only had the joy of visiting you once but I am left with such fond memories that I am sure I will find an excuse to visit you again soon. I was there with quite a large party but we all received exceptional service from the very professional wait staff. The interior and ambiance is more upscale but still warm and welcoming. We got a few appetizers but the only one I remember were the giant seafood towers. The towers were an amazing display of a variety of fresh seafood selections. I believe there was crab, shrimp, oysters, and other delicious sea fare. The steak cuts and selections were impressive and I appreciated the presentation of the cuts prior to selection. My steak was cooked perfectly to order and I could not have been happier. The prices are obviously higher for this type of establishment, but it is worth the price!  Vintage I will be back whenever I have an excuse for the extravagance."}
{"text":"Great spot for a steak. With friends or your gal. Friday night live Jazz brings back memories of Montreal. Great service and food."}
{"text":"Husband took me here last night. I really liked the layout of the restaurant (nice tables, good lighting and a great bar area). I also really liked the jazz music...playing Sinatra etc. our food was delish! Lobster mashed potatoes taste like heaven and I could eat the creamed spinach as a whole meal. Steak cooked perfectly and a massive wine list. My only complaint is that our mains came out too fast! Literally seconds after I finished my soup so I was sooooooo full I could barely eat my steak. At a restaurant like this, I like to take my time in between. We usually wait to order our main until after we have our appies but the waiter asked if we would like to order all at once so we did. Won't do that again. Service was excellent. Hy's is still my top steak place in Calgary but Vintage is a close second!"}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of my girlfriends to have a girls weekend away from Edmonton.  We were having fun but it looked like our server was not in the mood for us. However,  he took the time to explain and give us information about each steak and how it is preferably cooked.  One of the girls and I asked for prime rib. We both have had beef tataki (Japanese rare steak appetizer) before...  But this steak was not done to medium rare (like we asked). Andy friend did not like her steak at all. He only came once to ask how as the food and by then we finished some of our steak and was soooooo hungry, that we didn't bother to tell him.  The steak was rare. There was blood and it was very tough to cut.  And both of ours were done differently as well.  Hers was more tough and chewy,  but mine was more easy to chew and cut. And I'm always in the mood for some creme Brule but...  It tasted like egg tarts. I didn't even finish it...  However,  there were some highlights....  The baked Alaska  was soooooo good.  And their sidea like lobster mash, scallops and the mushrooms were cooked to perfection!!!!!   I'm kinda torn, if I should come back or not even bother.  But who knows!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best steak I've ever had.  Combine local Alberta beef and a chef that knows how to use a grill like a composer directing an orchestra and the result is a symphony of texture and taste.  Our waiter came out with a wood platter displaying samples of the uncooked cuts of meat offered on the menu.  He provided a brief overview regarding the differences in the cuts and marbling with insight on how each cut should be ordered to maximize the flavor.  It was obvious that there was no bad choice.  The twelve ounce rare tenderloin I ordered was juicy and tender despite being such a lean cut of meat.  Vintage definitely knows how to serve a great steak and chophouse dining experience.  This will be a definite stop for me each time I return to Calgary."}
{"text":"We had a group (12 people) lunch today at the chophouse.  We arrived at 11:30 and were seated immediately.  Our server was friendly and took our beverage order immediately. By noon, we placed all of our food order.   By 12:45 our food still had not arrived, not even the bread and butter, nor our appetizers.  Our lunch organizer talked to the manager about the wait.  The manager apologized and showed up some bread immediately. By 1:00, our appetizers started to show up.  I ordered the beef tenderloin carpaccio with fried capers.  Unfortunately, the carpaccio didn't have much favor. By 1:20, none of our entree had shown up.  By looking around, there were several bigger tables still had no food and they are sat down the same time as us. I end up had to leave without my seafood fettucini because I had a meeting.  My coworkers were kind enough to pack my fettucini for me and bring it back to the office.  The fettucini was lukewarm by the time it was brought back, But I quite enjoyed the sauce with a lot of garlic in it.  The shrimp was done right while I suspect the scallop would be pretty good if it was fresh.  It is a shame that I can't enjoy the food fresh and it took unreasonably long for the food to be served.  Will I go back one more time?  Probably yes.  I hope you have better luck than us"}
{"text":"The facility is cozy but Could be better, I ordered the rack of Lamb and it was blasé. The service was bad or maybe I just had a terrible server. Not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Came in to Vintage late on a Friday night during a recent trip to Calgary. It was a couple of blocks from my hotel and I was very excited to try the much vaunted Alberta steaks. Louie my server was friendly and knowledgeable. Unfortunately that was the extent of the positives that night. For some reason there was no host(ess) when I arrived and after waiting a few minutes I had to flagged down a server to finally get seated. I ended up getting the New York steak with the Oscar topping. The meat, even for that cut, was quite chewy in some places. The béarnaise had a very poor consistency and looked and tasted like butter mixed with tarragon leaves. I had also informed the server that I'm allergic to shrimp so would only eat the scallops and to my surprise the steak was only accompanied by 2 scallops, which cost me $15. I'll look elsewhere next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"BEST steak in town! BEST lobster mac on the planet! Go ahead and TREAT yourself! Service is always TOP-NOTCH! Great place to come and listen to LIVE music with a glass of WINE and CUT-A-RUG if your feeling FRISKY! ...why not?!"}
{"text":"Just met there with local business partners and a current partner of ours from Germany who we may be taking things to a higher level with.  We needed a classy setting that wasn't going to be too loud...  The waiter was extremely knowledgable and sold us all on amazing steaks.  Wow.  Very good.  Also, he knew when to interrupt and when not to.  He was very good at judging the vibe of the table.  I suggest you check this place out.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch recently at Vintage Chophouse.  We had a nice private room with lovely oil paintings of the Rat Pack and music from that era.  The chairs were quite comfy around the large dining table.  You could easity sit 16 people around the table quite comfortably.  We ordered from the lunch menu and I had the daily soup - cream of tomato - ever so good!  The boss also ordered lots of appetizers for the group and I had the crab cake and calamari - they were both really tasty!  My entree was the steak sandwich - comes with either a salad, fries or soup.  I had the green salad with a vinagrette.  I love my steak rare and it actually came as I had ordered it.    My colleague ordered the Beef Stew and he liked it.  It came with 2 cheese pastries.  Another colleague ordered the Beef Stragonoff on egg noodles - that was a huge platter.  Apparently, the waiter will ask how you want your beef done - for a stragonoff?  That's different!  Another colleague had fish and chips - looked really good with tartar sauce.  Yum!  For dessert, there was a light cake with raspberries and a light chocolate icing on the top.  Nice and light.  I would definitely try a different item next time, hmmm, maybe the Stragonoff.  I just wish the restaurant was nearer to the downtown core."}
{"text":"Eat in the Lounge.  Vintage Chophouse I dare to say is just like any other expensive steakhouse. It features waiters that have a bit of an \"edge\" outfitted in butcher lab coats (so lame) carrying a tray of meat showing various cuts. The standard cuts with sides and a smattering of seafood define a lot of chop houses. Except at Vintage, there were no (veal) chops.  They also did not have a Porterhouse which is a very popular cut. And while the meat is good, our group did not find the final product to be as good as Hys or Ruth Chris or many others. The waiter is our case seemed to overlook the fact that the five of us were settling in a seemed to scowl when we said we needed more time.  So are far as the product goes, it is definitely good but not awesome. In terms of the setting, we had a drink in the lounge later and all agreed that we should have ate there. The service was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Wrote a review last year on my old account. Returned this year for our anniversary again and blown away by the service and food again! So, so amazing. Great quality food and drinks, we will keep returning here for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Finally after coming to Vintage three times since December I am leaving my review! The first time was a for a birthday with a large group of friends and the service was so good!! We were presented with a platter of different types of steaks and they looked so delicious! The $85 Wagyu was something DH couldn't stop raving about afterwards because nothing else he ate after that could even compare.   The second time we came for Valentine's Day and they had a couples special with 4 courses. It was so good and way too much food!! I'm definitely already looking forward to next year's feature.   The latest visit was for the Big Taste and they did not disappoint!! A 5 course meal for yours truly and a Wagyu steak for DH again. The Big Taste menu was a lot of food for me but it was very memorable. For $65 it was an incredible deal!!   If you're up for a $100-150 meal/person including a bottle of wine you should definitely come here! Of course it doesn't have to be that much, but we love our wine and steak too much! Easily one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week with my bestie for Big Taste. The menu drew us in as it had some interesting elements. I had the french onion soup to start and my friend had the tomato salad. When I go out somewhere to eat, I tend to try their French Onion soup if they offer it because I love seeing how different places make it, and I really enjoyed this one. It was light but flavorful with just the right amount of cheese. Yum! I also snagged a bite of the tomato salad, which was also excellent. For my main I had the Thick Cut BLT which I thought would just be a regular BLT...boy was I wrong! This thing was HUGE!! As soon as the waiter put the plate in front of me, I assessed the situation and wondered how I was going to be able to eat it...when they say thick cut, they mean it. The pork was wonderful, all the flavors and textures of the sandwich came together really nicely. The only things I did not like was that the sandwich fell apart right away...a little messy. And although the pork WAS thick cut and tasty, unfortunately a few bites I had were just pure grease. To end the meal we had the sticky toffee pudding, which was TO DIE. I cant speak for the price, since the Big Taste menu was set at $25 (which I thought was fair for what we got), but the service was excellent, very friendly but not bothersome. I didn't get much of a chance to scope out the interior but it had a very classy feel to it, somewhere you could have a business lunch or a nice dinner. I will probably come back to try the much raved about steak."}
{"text":"My friends and I treated ourselves to lunch at the Vintage Chop.  I have been by there so often and never went in.  It was so much bigger then I thought it was, and very nice decor. Our waiter was very good - didn't bother us too much but was there when we needed something or had a question.  The food was very good, but I was so disappointed in the baked Alaska for dessert.  Not like any I have had before.  I would go back again and try their steaks next time."}
{"text":"A friend and I popped into the Tavern side of Vintage Chophouse for a glass of wine and a quick bite to eat after work. Where other spots typically are busy come the 6pm Friday crowd, Vintage was surprisingly not. We seated ourselves at the bar and ordered or drinks followed by a salad to munch on.  The interior is lovely, it's a darker decor, wasn't overly loud and there were a few other groups that were enjoying themselves as well. When it came time for my salad, a cloth napkin was set down on the wood as a place mat before my bowl. For interior and service, Vintage gets a 4. We were well taken care of.  The salad didn't really do it for me though. I ordered the Vintage chopped chick pea salad. I was expecting a bowl full of chick peas with some other veggies sprinkled in. Instead, I got a bowl full of chopped up lettuce with a few chick peas. Not as impressive as i would've thought for chophouse.  I'd be back to try more, but I'd go for a full meal next time... and maybe skip the salads if the rest are like this one was."}
{"text":"Had the steak and the lamb. Both were delicious. The service was nice and friendly. He explained the different cuts of steak well - and showed us actual pieces of meat on a cutting board. Dimly lit, romantic atmosphere.  we even had a 'vintage' dessert... the baked alaska! haha. Great meal, great company.  There is live music Friday and Saturday nights at 10pm."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favourite restaurants!! The service is always impeccable; food is always to order; great selection on the menu and wine list. I just love it!"}
{"text":"Great Steaks Three of us ordered tenderloins. Threat were delicious. The rare steaks were just a bit more well done than we like.  Still , they were very tasty and the mushrooms, a asparagus, and Cabernet were excellent complements to the beef. The service was attentive and not pushy. A very nice evening."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for dinner a couple of nights ago.  The service was excellent!  Our server brought a meat board explaining the cuts of beef.  The wine list has a selection of wines from all over the world.  I had a striploin steak which was quite good.  It was cooked a little more than I had requested, but it had a good char which added flavour.  My wife had the seafood pasta which she also enjoyed.  All in all a pleasurable experience.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Calgary."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Ribeye in Calgary! Friday nights are fun with a live band and the tapas menu is devine!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Mike and his amazing team at Vintage on Friday night.  We showed up with a group of 25 people, unannounced.  They adjusted to make it all happen, and with smiles and great service!  I strongly recommend Vintage for lunch, dinner, and live music and dancing!  #LoveThem!  Catherine:)"}
{"text":"One of our fav steakhouses in Canada. This is coming from Mastro (west coast) steakhouse elites! lol Service is always great here and they go above and beyond to make your meal great. Came here prob 3 times since we moved to Alberta and enjoyed each occasion. Came for an anniversary dinner a couple weekends ago and they had a lovely booth set up in the back with complimentary champagne. It was really sweet and a thoughtful way to begin our dinner. My fiance is a meat eater and me a vegetarian BUT they have great options for veggies. And their beets are AMAZING! Wow yellow and red beets, so big and juicy - they are a side item but so good! Last time we were here we ordered Apps: ESCARGOT FRICASSE - the waiter was very informative about this dish, he noted it is not like normal escargot (i wouldn't know but my fiance liked it) Roasted oyster mushrooms, cream sauce $14 Tomato Salad - Seasonal Tomato, local mozzarella $12 Mains: I had the Vintage Chopped for my main and it was HUGE (Chick peas, mushrooms, honey balsamic $12) CANADA PRIME RIB EYE 14 oz $39 Sides (we LOVE sides - plus great for a vegetarian): roasted mushrooms $10 red & gold beets $10 bacon scalloped potatoes $10  Overall everything was great with big portions!  Love this place and def will be back :)"}
{"text":"This is on a par with the high end US steakhouses from a meat perspective, but at this price and level, needs a little more furnishing, better service and classic ambiance to compete with the likes of Capital Grille or the high end places. Great food, the lack of ambiance, the amateur wait service and quite terrible live music take away from what could have been a great steakhouse."}
{"text":"One of my favourite steakhouses in town. Came here with a friend for Japanese Wagyu but they didn't serve it during lunch so we went with the Alberta Wagyu instead. Such a nice tender cut of beef cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth. Paired it up with a nice glass of red wine and a couple of side dishes (they do their sides very well). Service was really good and wasn't even something we had to question or worry about. Things just happened and we enjoyed our time."}
{"text":"Both times I went to Vintage were great. The service is professional; The staff is experienced and have obviously been trained well.   Food: I've had the ribeye and the tenderloin, if you want to share a they'll slice your steak in strips and all the sides  are great.   Ambience: you can have private conversations in large private rooms or comfortable booths all around this spacious restaurant. The tables are gorgeous, the lighting is gorgeous, the cutlery and table settings are just right and what you would expect from a high-end steakhouse. The band is awesome. They are on the beat, people get up and dance and have a good time, and it adds a little something extra to your evening.  Also, this place is close to the Saddledome so if you want a nice dinner before or after the game this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom back in February 2016. We are in Alberta, so of course we had to venture to treat ourself to some beef. And we found it here at the Tavern. I had the best steak ever. It was cooked to perfection. There was so much flavour. That's it. Not much else to say besides it was amazing. The end."}
{"text":"I have to rate this place with 5 stars... The wine was excellent! The appetizers were delicious, they have the best crab cakes in town!! And the oysters were very good too!! The steak was awesome! Definitely delicious!! For dessert I had lemon pie and it was great too... The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly ... In addition, the ambience is super cool... They have live music on Saturday nights... I definitely would go back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"it was a real treat. We had a kid named Jake taking care of us. He was really good with all the cuts of meat and helped us make some tough decisions. The food was so good and the steak was buttery.   Mac and Cheese was phenomenal and loved the onion rings.   Olde Fashioned was made right and they were prompt with more water for us.  Baked Alaska was a great finish to the meal.   Thanks to my Friend for the recommendation"}
{"text":"I just spent a weekend in Calgary for a friend's wedding and entirely changed my view of the city. I had a fairly negative impression of Calgary from past visits, including the dining scene, but this time I left highly impressed...and Vintage was one of the reasons why.   We've all (in Canada) had Alberta beef, but I'd never seen it prepared so well. These guys season it and cook it to perfection. I have no idea what they put on it but it works. I thought I sensed a bit of butter, and various hints of spices, mild enough to let you enjoy the meat, but present enough to accentuate the natural flavor. Together with the perfect texture of the the meat, a definite contender for best steak I've ever had.  I had to do a pretty serious run along the river and bluffs (stunning this time of year) the next day to work off the meal, but no question it was worth it."}
{"text":"One of my all time favourite restaurants in Calgary. Never disappoints great steaks with a pleasant atmosphere and stellar service."}
{"text":"Long overdue review.    Made a last minute reservation here and the staff was very nice and helpful.  The food is a true Alberta steak experience.  I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone local or visiting to get a great YYC steak dinner.  A M A Z I N G   *I am normally a very picky diner but this place really satisfied me.    Enjoy."}
{"text":"We went BACK to Vintage for a little redo of our previous experience, and boy what a time we had.  This time we were greeted by several wonderful hostesses all smiles and friendliness.  Our jackets were taken, we were shown to our very cool high bar table in the tavern. Geri Lynn greeted us right away and took our drink order, menus were presented at time of arrival.  Geri Lynn is beyond adorable.  She was efficient, friendly, super dooper cute and everyone just loved her.  I think we annoyed the sh*t out of her though. Our appies were the tuna tartare and beef tartare, both delicious.  Mains included the short rib x3, the lamb, tenderloin with bernaise, striploin.  Everyone over ate and groaned as they hugged their bellies full of delicious beers and beef.  Just delicious. The most surprising part of the night was the bill, no desserts but we had booze and appies and it was 330 for 6 people.  I was thoroughly impressed given the quality of the meals and service.  An amazing experience, I'm so glad we went back."}
{"text":"I will start by saying this food was top notch. However I am not leaving a review for the food. I was extremely impressed by the professionalism and pride of our server Jeremy. He took some extra time and explained to use about the beef, wine and other things around Town. The service was great, relaxing and was overall a great experience. Towards the end of our dinner, a live band started to play some tunes, it really added to the ambiance. After looking at some negative reviews if this place, it seems that only pretentious d bags have bad things to say. I'm a fan of good food, good service and friendly banter with my wait staff. This place fits the bill. It was worth every penny and if I ever find myself back in the Canadian tundra again I will forsure be back"}
{"text":"Hand's down best steak in Calgary. I've been here 6 times now and the service is great and food quality is consistently phenomenal. I have recommended Vintage to anyone I can and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"All in all not bad, perhaps my bar is a bit too high having experienced some of the better steak places in the Northeast (NYC, Philly).  For the price, decent value - intend to try some additional steak places in Calgary but I would come back at some point.  The restaurant is pretty large, sat in the 'bar' area on a Saturday night right before the live music kicked off.  Cool scene, the plush leather booths are comfortable and its nice to have a TV in the background if you want to follow a sports event.  Things did not start off too well when I ordered a Grey Goose on the rocks and what I got was 85% soda water and vodka - the waitress was cool about taking back and getting it right, but jeesh not like I ordered anything complicated.  As to the food, the steak was pretty good and the lamb chop portion was very generous (5 chops!) with better than average (not fantastic) quality."}
{"text":"My Husband and I were so glad we found Vintage online and tried it out!  We've been a few times now and it's been great every time!  The steaks are amazing and the Lobster Mac and cheese will not disappoint!  The jalapeño cream corn is oh so tasty!  If you're lucky, they'll have the turtle cheesecake!  Yum!  This is a definite must try for a lovely dinner out!"}
{"text":"While Vintage is definitely an expensive spot, you absolutely get what you pay for. The service was incredible. Our server took the time to slowly explain the differences between the various cuts of meat as well as why you would want to have your meat cooked the way they recommend it. The food was just as good as the service; I probably had the best steak I've ever had in my entire life here."}
{"text":"Short Rib to die for.! Let me just put that out there.  This weekend's visit to Vintage was a redo of last month when we came for a birthday party and were thoroughly let down - by the service and not the food. So a rematch it was. This time we decided to dine in the tavern side versus the dining room side as a change of pace...and it was a Saturday night after all, so the atmosphere was a great fit. The tavern side is still quite elegant, professional and clean but adding to the atmosphere is the tall tables, cool bar and quiet TV's in the background.  We were seated immediately to our reserved table by an enjoyable hostess who was a breeze of fresh air. Just as quickly was our waitress who came to deliver menus and take drink orders. Our server for the night was S-Geri Lynn who was an absolute delight. A perfect blend of laid back (but professional), cute and adorable (but not a ditz) and overall a joy to have serving us who also thanked us for being her table upon leaving.  But back to the food. We all ordered beers (giant delicious Hoegaardens) and some mixed cocktails. Service was prompt and efficient. For appies we ordered the beef tartare and tuna tartare (obviously we had a raw food thing happening). Both were quite delicious and beautifully presented with crustinis and crackers to help eat them. The meat was very fresh and delicately matched to perfect sauces. For our mains we had a couple rounds of the braised short rib, one lamb shank, rib eye and tenderloin steak. The short ribs were to die for - no seriously, I felt I lost lives as I savored this dish for about an hour. It is so flavorful, ridiculously tender (why even give me a steak knife to cut it) and a generous serving. It was paired with creamed potatoes and broccollini (but who cares about sides when the meat is beyond delicious). The lamb shank was very comparable in taste and tenderness so an equally amazing choice. Steak is what this place does well, so the steaks were also very well received with a beautiful side of béarnaise sauce that nicely complemented the tenderloin. As a side for the table we chose the truffled mac and cheese. Now truffle isn't for everyone, but it is for me - so that said, this was a very unique version of mac and cheese as the truffle brings out a very different flavor - but it works. The corkscrew pasta is perfect for sopping up the creamy sauce and it has a perfect crunchy topping. This is a great mac and cheese to share (it's quite rich to eat on your own!).  I wish I could comment on desserts, however the servings here are quite sizeable for a high end restaurant so we had to pass on desserts (both a complaint and a blessing). All the portions of meat were fairly large and being accompanied with sides made the meals very filling and enjoyable.  I've been to Vintage three times now. The first was five years ago and the visit was great. The second was last month and the service was awful, so we had to do a quick redo based on an apology and request to return from the manager. The third visit this weekend was phenomenal. They couldn't have hit better notes - from the entrance, to the expedient service, to the amazing food, to the delightful and attentive server. I look forward to a redo of the redo?"}
{"text":"Best steaks in the city. The front desk area is crowded and small af but once you're in, you're okay. I'm brown and can sometimes get snooty people serving me. Not here. I felt welcome. The rest of the restaurant stared at us but f*** them, the food and service is awesome!!!!!! I had the 14 oz rib eye medium-rare and it was heavenly bruh. I highly recommend this place for that special occasion. We celebrated my girls birthday and my one year sobriety. Bless"}
{"text":"As a die-hard meat eater this Steakhouse is not to be missed. The atmosphere is as super chill, and the service fast and friendly. The Steaks.....OMG so good.  The entrés are not to be missed and my scallops for an  appy were also perfectly cooked.  This place us a Gem and not to be missed."}
{"text":"Big restaurant, with a bar section. Dark wood dark leather jazz/blues music kind of ambiance. Good service, a bit on the overpriced side. Tried the tuna tataki with the honey carrots. Cooked perfectly, but I still think 35$ is too much for what is offered."}
