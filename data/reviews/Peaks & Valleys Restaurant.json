{"text":"Driving by this place, my friend and I decided to pop in for a late lunch. There was a woman working the bar - serving several people. She saw us but did not greet us. We stood there for a few minutes wondering if we wait to be seated or seat ourselves. My friend walked up to the bar to ask, and she told us to seat ourselves. The inside area is very dark and smells of cigarette smoke, but the patio area is decent with nice views. We sat out there for about 15 minutes without any service. There was a couple seated outside as well. They were there before us, and they didn't even have any drinks on their table. That's when we decided to leave. 
What a strange way to run a business. Based on other positive reviews, I must've walked in on an off day? Short-staffed? I don't know but, after my own experience, I don't care to find out."}
{"text":"Had allot of fun here last Friday night. The service was great and friendly, food was good.  Live music was neat but very loud for the low number of customers that were there (not enough background noise to justify the volume of the singer).  But still, after riding a motorcycle from Salt Lake to Phoenix, this was a great welcoming place to eat and drink!"}
{"text":"We are always having a great time when we walk in the door. ... great staff,  super friendly,  great food,  go for the camelback burger,  kudos! !!!"}
{"text":"Men's room needs paint and soap.  The volume of non bar \"stuff\" behind the bar (purses, broom and dust pan, clothing) was not very appealing to look at during our entire meal.  Pepsi tasted like 1/4 diet and the rest regular.  Did not get one part of the special requests with our order correct.  No sincere apology and we paid full price for the meal.  Prior to writing this I sent an email to them via their website, that was more than 2 weeks ago and haven't heard a thing back.  Kinda sad, there's not many restaurant options our here and I'd like to think it wouldn't take much effort to provide a pleasant experience.  Perhaps things will change as more options become available."}
{"text":"I love this place! The chicken fried chicken is awesome!! Great drink specials & wonderful service!! You've gotta go to Peaks & Valleys!!"}
{"text":"Great food and live music, I enjoy the location and atmosphere of this place very much."}
{"text":"Good food, pleasant atmosphere, great views of surrounding mountains. Tried dinner and breakfast- both meals were cooked well, presentation of food good, and priced moderately."}
{"text":"First time.  I will give it another try I think. But I took my food home to cook it better. I should have sent it back but I didn't have time.  They need to step it up.  At 6pm it was empty. I should have realized that I should just have had a cocktail  try it I guess.  But set the bar low"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The service was extremely slow! We were 2 of 10 people in the entire place and it took almost an hour to get our food. I got the Mediterranean chicken which they told me would take 25 minutes to cook, which would have been fine except it took about 50 minutes. I doubt we will be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"An inexpensive surprise. I have always loved chicken and waffles. I'm a southerner. Their chicken is on point and definitely tastes fresh. The batter isn't soaked with grease like the rest of the fried chicken in AZ. I have been there several times now and am never disappointed with their chicken. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Breakfast burrito and a couple of drinks hit the spot.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"came in tonight with the $7.99 Friday Fish Fry coupon. Fish was OK; definitely not Cod. The cole slaw was too soggy and too sweet. Also, the Friday Fish Fry was NOT all you can eat. all the restaurants in Phoenix that do FFF's are ALWAYS all you can eat! No wonder there were only three dining tables filled with customers! I am not coming back! In addition the place looked like a Cowboy bar more than amything and the atmosphere was lousy. I will be surprised if this place lasts through the summer of 2012."}
{"text":"More of a country type place.  They had great appetizers, as the four items my group ordered all went down easy and picked those dishes clean.

It would help if the ladies room had more than 2 stalls... not their fault I'm sure.  Also found the servers and bartenders there are very friendly and entertaining.  This is a fun place, and I had a great time even though I'm not a country type person myself.

One negative point of this place is some of the songs my friend paid for on the jukebox was skipped over. Not fun to pay good money to listen to a song from the play list and only get 10 seconds of song."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun. There isn't many places in the area that provide great service, fun atmosphere and treat everyone like a local. Highly recommended for good live music,  cold beers and a social hang out."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  My boyfriend and I were welcomed with open arms by not only every employee there but the customers too.  Have a better time each time we go.  Great music. Great food. Great drinks and the owner is beautiful and super welcoming and fun.  Bring your friends for a no judgement good time!"}
{"text":"We were encouraged to give them another shot and I'm glad we did.  They've reconfigured the inside and it looks like some renovations are still happening.  It still has a ways to go but it's looking much better and more like a \"real\" restaurant.  

The food has improved as well.  The AZ tots are tasty.  My buffalo chicken wrap hit spot and the side of peppercorn sweet potato fries were yummy as well.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his chicken corn chowder soup.  He raved about the mashed potatoes but found the chicken fried chicken a bit tough.  

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with 10 or so friends on a Sunday afternoon motorcycle ride, the outdoor patio has a amazing view, Food was excellent, service was great, and not to mention a full bar! I loved this place and it will be a regular stop anytime I'm in the area!!!"}
{"text":"UGH! Typical diner and not in a good way. The problem with this place is that it's never the same. If Costco has bacon on sale she's buying it from Costco. If Restaurant Depot has it on sale she's driving all the way down there. Biscuits Cafe is so good because it's ALWAYS the same. This lady just buys the cheapest and it shows!!! I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I love the bar!! They have great bands,food and customer service also they make the best bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"Want to start by saying this is our second time here and we are so happy to have given this place a second chance. First time was 2-3 years ago and we were not impressed. We had decided not to return. Well we are back and happy as hell we returned!!!!!

Un-freaking-real how delightful our service was. Honestly, the service we received is bar-none the BEST service we have ever received ever. EVER. Even the buser girl was outstanding, I'm not kidding....she was carrying buckets to the kitchen and happened to see I was done with my meal...she immediately set the buckets down, and walked the other direction to take my plate....And that's just one example. Both servers made sure we had drinks coming. Both servers gave us menus. Smiles whole time. Just a happy environment!!!! We like happy people and people who enjoy their jobs!! This is the place! 

The food was great! Fianc√© got the croissant and I got the chicken fried steak. Both were really good! The potatoes were perfect!!! The butter for my toast was whipped (thank you). Great cooks! 

The bathroom was clean and cool! Hand lotion, spray, mints, etc!

As I'm typing this, the server and buser are saying \"thank you! Have a great week!\" To the table leaving. 

Thank you for knowing how to be. Oh we are coming back that's for sure. 

Again....BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. And good food and clean and awesome."}
{"text":"When we first walked in, I was struck by the friendliness of the staff.  Hubby loves Sierra Nevada and was more than happy to learn he had a choice of THREE!!  We ordered the Chicken Corn Chowder and the Arizona Tots. .. both very very good. Hubby's meat sauce spaghetti was wonderful,  as was my Byrd BLT-- hey, put green chilies and avocado on any sandwich and I am ecstatic,  this was no exception! !! Excellent -- bacon done just right,  crispy with NO floppy parts,  and the avocado was perfect. This place has great views, huge outside dinning, easy parking.  But the best part is their tribute to our Veterans.  They have a whole wall devoted to their honor.  Good to see!!"}
{"text":"Went in having no idea what to expect except what I had read here on Yelp.. Food was good, salsa was great! I enjoyed the patio, our friend even brought there dog who was allowed to be on the patio with no issues from any of there staff. Waitress was on top of it, double checked the order, it came out right. On Sundays if you order two Alcohol drinks ya get a free breakfast.. That was cool.. Prices were in line with portions and quality.."}
{"text":"Bring your friends and family for good food and a great, quality, neighborhood experience. We love it."}
{"text":"My 8 year old son and I decided to try this restaurant out for breakfast.  He ordered a waffle with two eggs and two sausage and I ordered two eggs over medium bacon potatoes and sourdough toast. When we walked up to the restaurant we weren't sure whether it was open or not because the windows have a very dark tint.  We almost walked away thinking it was closed but then realized it was open. When we walked in we weren't greeted at the door by anybody and we weren't sure whether to seat ourselves   One  the customers seated near the door advised as that it was seat yourself.  Looking straight ahead it was a long bar area with a few tables. To the right of the entrance of the restaurant was a rectangular seating area for guests that would prefer not to sit in the bar; however this seating area was not appealing at all as it was tucked away in a corner with no view. The most appealing seating was near the bar as it had a terrific view and windows.   We did notice there was more seating outside and the weather was nice. But this would not be an option when it's 110¬∞ out in Phoenix. We decided to sit outside on the patio. It had a fantastic view. There were ashtrays outside on a few of the tables. So if you are a non-smoker it ofagain does not leave you a lot of choice. We were lucky this morning though as nobody was smoking.  The tables were dirty. We asked if they could clean our table for us and she brought a wet towel that wasn't wrung out leaving our table sopping wet.  When my son ordered his waffle he would've liked to have had one bacon and one sausage however she said there were no substitutions and he had to have both bacon or both sausage.  She brought our food which was a lot of food on little bitty plates. They either need bigger plates so that you can work with your food or to add extra plates if you get a waffle or pancakes on the side. The sausage links they brought my son were huge. He would have preferred regular sausage links they did not appeal to him.  My bacon was very thin and there wasn't much to it. The butter they brought for the waffle was frozen in little packets you could not even spread on your waffle.   I requested Tabasco sauce but all they had was topatio sauce which was kind of odd because the metal condiment holder were manufactured and advertising  by Tabasco brand.   Overall our food was good though and our waitress was nice. I would recommend that they bring smaller water glasses for the kids as they were huge and halfway through my sons meal he went to grab it and spilled it all over his plate and the table.  He had already eaten half his food so he was full thank goodness.   The women's bathroom was out of soap which always makes me wonder how the staff is washing their hands without soap. There was a lot I liked about the place and I think it has great potential but I can also see areas that may turn people off and that need to be addressed in order to maintain their customers and get them to come back."}
{"text":"Let me just say this. I've lived in the area for about 6 mths now and I'm not quite sure why any of the folks left reviews with less than 5 stars. I go here at least 3 times per week for drinks and/or to eat. I bring my family (2 sons ages 3&6) and they absolutely love this place. We can't drive by without them begging me to stop so we can go in. My wife loves the food as do I. We've had almost everything on the menu and haven't had a single complaint. I'm not sure where she found the cook but wow! sure is a keeper. Drink and food prices are great! I do Harley rides and we will stop here and they are always ready for us. I will keep coming back and pray this place never closes."}
{"text":"Great location to watch a summer storm roll in from the north. 

I had a Cuban, it was great. The staff was super nice and inviting, more of a down home feel then the normal server type experience. I like that too. 

Prices seem fair for the quality. 

Check it out."}
{"text":"I rate this place 5 stars because it is a very good value for the money. The service was absolutely some of the best I have ever had. Super friendly, accommodating, and quick. 

Now it's not a place that serves \"gourmet\" food, but it has excellent sandwiches, wraps, appetizers, and \"hearty\" home-style foods. 

The kids had chicken fingers and grilled cheese and ate every bite (for a 3 and 5 year old, that's amazing). I had the Byrd BLT and it was incredible!!  My friend had an omelet and loved hers, while her hubby had chicken and waffles with a side of biscuits and gravy. We all loved our respective meals. 

Not only was the food delicious and the service outstanding, but the bill was reasonable. We tipped our waitress very well, because she showed us the true meaning of customer service. We will go back!!"}
{"text":"The outside is super deceiving--this is a dive bar not a restaurant.  Service was ok tho and their spicy tots were awesome, salad not so much....random dog roaming INSIDE between guests tables is odd....and gross.  The reviews didn't match the experience"}
{"text":"My husband and I come her 2-3 times a week. Sometimes for dinner , sometimes just for drinks and live music. Its a great small town bar feel. The staff if friendly and easy going. They have fun events during the week, a pool table & a nice outside area."}
{"text":"So disappointing to see the place that looks like it has never been cleaned.  Trash all over the floor, tables fallen no apart and dirty."}
{"text":"Our go to place to have fun!!! Awesome drinks, fast service and the food is delicious and affordable. 
My favorite is the French Dip... I am a picky eater and always asking for things a special way; They always get it right and are super nice about it. The bartenders always remember what we drink and how we like it (maybe because we visit often). The owner is always floating around and is super friendly and interactive with her co-workers. She is also very supportive of our troops and makes sure to acknowledge how proud and appreciative she is for their service. This is so good to see and one of the reasons I love visiting Peaks and Valleys."}
{"text":"We will come back to this place. I had the chicken fried steak with baked potato and steamed veggies. Everything was cooked just right. I could cut the steak with my fork.  The chicken corn chowder was \"to die for\". Service was excellent, everyone was really friendly. I recommend making the drive."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food! We couldn't happier. We will definitely come here again and again and again. 

The staff is extremely friendly and personable. I can see why they have so many repeat customers at Peaks & Valleys. Its easy to feel right at home. 

Bottomless spaghetti with meat sauce tonight for only $8.99! Yum! One of my favorites. Thanks Peaks & Valleys Restaurant for a great evening."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour!! They recently remodeled the interior and have a huge patio. Great for the Saturday or Sunday hangover... Buy 2 drinks and breakfast is free, karaoke on Thursdays and usually bands on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 stars....we'll see what happens after they've been around for a bit longer.  I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere, the lighting seemed \"off\" and it looks like it was decorated for a one-day \"cowboy\" themed event.  And I couldn't tell if it was trying to be a cafe or a bar/pool hall.  Something just didn't connect. 

The food was decent.  We ordered a Chicken Sandwich, the Gyros, a side of the Arizona Tots and a side of the sweet potato fries.  The Gyros were really disappointing; but I suppose we should have known better than to order a Gyro sandwich in a cowboy place.  My chicken sandwich was good, freshly breaded and well cooked.  The Arizona Tots, while clearly frozen, were pretty tasty - kind of a mix between a tater tot and a jalepeno popper w/ melty cheese on the inside.  The sweet potato fries were perfectly done.  

Our waitress was wonderful and kept our drinks full.  

It's a decent little diner type spot.  I'll be interested to try breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood restaurant/bar. They've really been trying to raise the level of the good lately and it shows. I still wish they had Goose, but the bar selection is appealing as well. Local feel with a country twang. Great place to meet friends for a drink either before you start your evening or at the end."}
{"text":"Whether you live local or are coming in from out of town this is a great place to grab some food & drinks and catch some live music.

1) The food is consistently very good

2) The service is great

3) The live music is excellent

If you've never been, give it a try and if you've been here, I'm sure you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer:They were having a Dog Pageant when I came so it was a bit chaotic.

I sat at the bar and ordered a beer, I was surprised they didn't have a drink menu for liquor. I then went to order but noticed there was no online menu. 

I ordered wings and got them within 5-8 minutes. Overall the quality of the food I got was good. It was chaotic and disorganized but I have to attribute it to the event."}
{"text":"Nice place...a little divey (which isn't a bad thing).  It's a county music kind of place - NOT my thing but tolerable considering the foot was GREAT!  Chicken fried chicken was fantastic and the BLT salad had lots of crisp well done bacon.  Staff was super friendly-will be back

Update-7-10-16 last three times the chicken fried chicken has been terrible.  Actually a couple next to us said not to order it....I really don't know what has happened as we loved this place. Now...probably won't be back"}
{"text":"What a great little neighborhood restaurant.  I came here shortly after it opens and wasn't impressed. Fast forward a few years, because of Yelp reviews and I came back and brought a friend. What a great little place. I had Spicy Arizona Tots were fun and tasted great. The regular fries were just ok but the  balsamic chicken was outstanding and so was the French Dip and the Reuben. I want to come back for breakfast and give the place a try. They were string up for a band while we were there so it may be a great Saturday night hang out as well? Stay tuned"}
{"text":"Had the cardinal chicken sandwich for lunch and it was really good. My boyfriend got the spivey tots and those were great too. Kind of in the middle of nowhere but seemed like an ok place."}
{"text":"Nice open space.  Waitress needs to wear shoes not flip flops.  Ordered onion rings, but forgot to bring them to us.  We had a coupon for $7.99 fish fry, small three pieces.  The cole slaw was soggy, surprisingly the french fries were good.  Michael and I ordered gin & tonics, well drinks were $3.00 during happy hour.  You get what you pay for...they dont use the good gin.  We will not go back for the cocktails."}
{"text":"Good local bar.  Bartenders were very cool and bands are good.  Inside had nice simple feel including a pool table.  But the great area is the patio.  Looking forward to cooler weather."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, good menu selection. I need to go on a weekend night as I hear it gets pretty interesting."}
{"text":"Poor attempt at nachos. Chips (half plate) cheese n onions for 8 bucks? Sad at best..."}
{"text":"Great value!

Peaks and Valleys has a nice variety of tasty food, reasonably priced, with a very friendly wait staff.  My family has been there on a number of occasions and we've always been very pleased.  They now have a full-service bar up front for those so inclined.  

Try the various specials, especially the ribs - other great dishes include the Mediterranean Chicken, the burgers, the Greek salad, and the desserts are great, too."}
{"text":"Been to this place about a dozen times.  Got turned on to it because they are ( were ) part of a barter group that I do business with.  The reviews here seem generally spot on... Dive bar with average to good food.  Jalapeno Tater Tots are very good btw.  Most of my visits have been breakfast.... also very good and great weekend bartender!

On Sunday night we came in for dinner after a day of motorcycling with friends.  Sat at the bar and it took 10 minutes for my gal and I to get a drink.  Another 15 minutes before our dinner order was taken.  My girl and I split the prime rib as we aren't big eaters.... ordered med rare.... came out somewhere between medium well and well done.  Not the end of the world.  Bill came to $52 with tax and I tendered $50 barter currency and a $20 bill to cover tip ( 30% ) despite the fact that the service AND food on this occasion were sub par.  I ALWAYS over tip when doing barter because the last thing I want is to have a restaurant owner or their staff get a bad taste for barter business.

When the bartender advised me that they were not any longer accepting the barter currency... I was definitely disappointed as I chose to come here to use trade.  Nothing was posted on their door ( which I\"ve seen done at other places ).  In light of this revelation,.... I tendered $60 cash since food and service reflected 15% as an appropriate tip.  On that note..... remember when 15% WAS a good tip IF you received a great experience?????   

As we were headed out the door the bartender ( Beard & Plaid Lumberjack Shirt ) yelled across the restaurant 80' some sarcastic comment about thanks and glad you came in.  Aside from taking our order.... that was the most he spoke to us all night ...... so fair assessment that he saw the lesser tip and was unimpressed.  Completely out of line and unnecessary.  I feel like the owner should know how their restaurant is being represented."}
{"text":"This place is still serving up awesome food. It never fails when we are hungry and up in the area. Yesterday was our first time back in a few months and the remodeled inside looks great! 

I ordered eggs over medium, toast with home fries and a small stack of pancakes. Everything came out perfect and delicious. My boyfriend got the buffalo chicken wrap and that thing is GIANT and friggin' tasty. We are in love with their sweet potato fries here especially when they are extra crispy and dipped in ranch."}
{"text":"I must say that this restaraunt is a breath of fresh air.  The bar is great and the food is even better.  Very reasonable prices as well.  The owner is almost always there and not only is she \"easy on the eyes\" she is so welcoming to all her customers.  Most of which she knew by name.  Great place to go whether you are on a bike run or one of the locals comes in by horse.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a friendly atmosphere and a good meal without breaking the bank!!"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this restaurant for almost 2 months now, asked my family how the food was since it was close to home.. crickets....lol.
Well  finally decided to give it a shot...
We ordered the fried mushrooms, really good, hot till the very last one! Aces here!
Wife orders the special chicken fried chicken with white sausage gravy, she loved it, I snitched a bite, all I can say is wow.
I ordered the ribs server said he wasn't a rib guy but people like them I have them a try. Pretty sure there FSA.. but still mighty tasty.
Now this might sound weird but even the veg sides were treated with respect and we both commented they weren't the usual after thought we all come to expect.
So def. not a 5 Star sit down restaurant but for a local honky tonk with I swear real cowpokes.. you can't go wrong here!
Oh did I mention I didn't need to take out a second mortgage to pay for our meal?
Great value too!"}
{"text":"Good service, much improved atmosphere, okay food (this has improved tremendously in the past few months) and they have made a fair attempt at getting together some decent live music. The band I saw here last weekend (8/25/12) was very good and everyone else in the establishment had good things to say about their sound as well. I would have rated this with only one star right after they first opened, but the owner has made some definite improvements all around. I am glad I didn't give up on this place and I look forward to giving an even better rating in the future. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We have come here several times... we want to like it, it's a cool dive bar with lots of food options and live music, however, the service is horrible :( we have actually walked out several times due to not even being acknowledged by any of the staff. We arrived tonight around 6:45 and at 7:05 decided to head to Buffalo Wild Wings since not one person even said we will be right with you or can we get you a drink or even hi for that matter... so disappointed, hopefully the manager wasn't on duty because if that's the case then perhaps it's time to get a new manager."}
{"text":"I performed here a few weeks ago for a fundraiser to help a kid who needs a kidney. I guess I'm the comedian who's the poster child for this sort of thing now. Hahaha!
Sat at the bar with the other comics. Now, if you are a bartender and can handle four female comedians, you're pretty much tops in my book. Quick service with a very sexy smile. (I had to throw that in there because he WAS so sexy!)
I had some sort of tater tots with cheese and jalapenos. They were good, and the $4 wasn't a bad price. It just didn't seem like anything homemade. I did, however, order a second batch. They were yummy, just not extraordinary.
There is a large patio with heaters outside, too.
The place is pretty big with wood decor all over the place. I mean, what else would you expect near Cave Creek? Actually, I don't even know where the heck it was, I just remember jumping on the 17 from Downtown and driving forever to get there."}
{"text":"Adding to my previous review, the service went WAY downhill!  The bartender was working his rear off while one cocktail waitress talked to a friend for an hour and the other ignored us. Even when we called her over, she never said a word, not even \"thank you\" when we paid. It was weird."}
{"text":"Everyone is super friendly here. It's that neighborhood bar I have been looking for. I have tried several things but the Byrd BLT is easily the best BLT I have ever had. Tons of perfectly cooked bacon, whole green chili strips,  avocado. Perfect ratio of everything. And the spicy AZ tots... Yum!!!  Drinks are also perfectly poured to order. Come here instead of the chains!"}
{"text":"Uh oh! A new restaurant on Carefree Hwy? Not even Subway can survive this location. Gallagher's also just closed its doors, not to mention the 10 other restaurants that have fallen victim nearby over the past year...

It better be good!

This restaurant opened in late June. They are predicting a Grand Opening in late September - early October, when their liquor license  is granted. I spoke with the owner and she is very excited about her new venture and knowledgeable about the restaurant industry. Her family operates several dining establishments around the Valley. They currently have indoor dining, but will add outdoor dining and entertainment soon.  The place has a nice feel; the atmosphere, service, and ambiance are very pleasant and inviting. There menu is nice; they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I had the Philly and my wife ordered a Chicken Sandwich. Both were really good - four out of five stars. The Arizona Tots, instead of french fries, were delish! Prices are average for the area. This place has a great deal of potential and should do well.

Check it out!"}
