{"text":"We discovered this restaurant completely by accident while visiting family in Brampton and we love it!  We have been three times, and each time the food was fabulous, and despite being very busy the service was fast, friendly and professional.  We live in Toronto and have our pick of restaurants of every cuisine and price range imaginable, but we look forward to eating here again on special occasions.  It's a gem!"}
{"text":"Went here last night. Food was good but is far too overpriced for the type of restaurant. Service was limited to a few quick interactions to take orders and bring the cheque.  

Just saw on the news this morning that a broken watermain flooded the place.  While I'll abstain from any \"fresh seafood\" comments they should definitely take the opportunity to update the place. I would only go back if someone else was paying as there are many better options for the cost."}
{"text":"I often use Yelp, but have never written a review. This evening my wife and three year old son went to Veseuvo and had a fabulous meal. It was so good that we even exchanged two high fives and could not believe our good fortune - seriously! We are from Vancouver and staying with in laws.

The service from Maria was top shelf and the food was excellent. You could taste the fresh basil in the sauce and the acidity level was perfect.

The wood oven pizza was also fantastic and I am looking forward to eating the last slice after the family goes to bed. It was not sloppy nor was it too crisp- that sweet spot that you want.

Prior to writing the review, I was shocked to see the two poor reviews that were posted as they could not have been further from our experience.

We are out here twice a year and will definitely be coming back.

{"text":"We went on a Friday night and it was dead.  The manager seemed upset that we were there and made our experience uncomfortable and made us feel unwelcome along with the (maybe) 2 other tables that were dining.  I definitely could see why it wasn't busy.  The food was decent but we got out of there as quickly as we could."}
{"text":"Great restaurant to find a live music scene. Our server went out of his way to ensure our experience was amazing. The food was authentic. The hot sauce is phenomenal"}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised that this place doesn't have more reviews as it's quite literally the oldest restaurant in Brampton (1963). However, it may not feel that way inside since the entire interior is virtually brand-new. This is due to the fact that a watermain broke on George St in 2016 and flooded the place. They took about a year to repair and completely renovate the restaurant. They did an excellent job, and the other aspect I appreciate about their ambience is that they're located right at the corner of George and Wellington streets. There aren't too many places in Brampton you can say has charm, but this spot overlooking Gage park is one of them and makes for a great patio in fair weather.

I'm a little surprised other reviewers say it's overpriced. To me, it's par for the course for somewhat higher-end Italian (and nowhere near the price of something high-end in Toronto). Most mains start at the high teens (pizza and some pasta dishes) and then into the $20's for most other items. There's probably 3-4 items at most which start over $30. I'm also unsure why it's presently classified as '$$$$' for price on Yelp. I suppose you could pay over $60/person, but I wouldn't say that's an average or unavoidable. The menu is online and can confirm this.

My wife and I enjoyed the Giuseppe salad to start. It's great if you're into sweeter salads as it had figs, pears, apricot and with a berry vinaigrette. The goat cheese was a natural pairing. I ordered the Vitello Piccata - which is veal is a seasoned lemon-based sauce. I opted for pasta as my side with an olive oil base. You're given a choice of for sides and pasta almost any way you want it. Note: veal features VERY prominently on the menu here. I think I saw it on the menu in about a dozen different ways. My wife ordered Vitello Vesuvio - but asked for chicken instead of veal (they're very comfortable with requests and adjustments). The chicken was stuffed with ham and cheese and served with a mushroom sauce. She chose to go with Gnocci in an alfredo sauce.

All in all, we came in expecting a good meal and got one. I don't think there was anything about it that may have knocked us off our feet, and the menu is fairly traditional - but it met fairly high expectations. They also ensure there's vibrant flavour as I experienced in my meal with the salad and that the lemon sauce wasn't afraid to have that tartness in lemon that I love. I still need to try their pizza as they're one of the few local places with a wood-burning oven."}
{"text":"Service was weird and rushed even though we were there for an early dinner and they weren't busy yet. . Food was good... but overpriced for what you get. Presentation was a bit sloppy . I had the veal and husband had a pizza. Both were just okay. We had been there before the renos and tried it again. Both times underwhelmed and most likely won't go back"}
{"text":"I went out to lunch and trying to seek 1 good Italian restaurant in Brampton, unfortunately it was not a sucess, this restaurant should have had a visit from Ramsey's Kitchen Nghtmares, the set of this place is off. First I think a remodelling job is needed, the service is slow and poor. The waiter \"uncle Fester\" did not even ask if we want drinks, served us  tap water and we had to ask. I told him i have never been there before to make a suggestion, he pushed the veal to every body, I guess thats what the cook had prepared, mind you he didn't answer my question clearly. The salads came out pretty fast but the entree took forever. The waiter was unattentive and the food barely passable at best, I can certainly cook better. still seeking that good quality Italian food restaurant????where art thou????"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin.  This place was recommended as excellent Italian. I happened to be in Brampton and decided to try it.  Without exaggeration, worst meal I have ever eaten. Gordon Ramsey could not save this tired, dirty, horrible food, poor excuse for a restaurant.  The dining room is dated (70's), felt unclean from the moment we walked in and that should have been our que to leave. How hard is it to make a salad that is fresh and tasty? How difficult is it to prepare a simple pizza?  How disturbing is it that pasta - in an Italian owned establishment, can be overcooked and completely tasteless?  Seriously - this place needs to close its doors or fire the entire staff and start from scratch.  Disappointment does not even describe our experience. We did not want to pay. That is how bad it was. Gobs of cheese on the pizza. Tasteless sauce. Fridge-stored spongy tomatoes. Salad dressing was grocery store bought oil and absolutely no flavour. Not even any balsamic vinegar!  Staff was overly attentive bordering on intrusive.  It bothered us even though we were completely not enjoying the meal.  A complete disaster. I kid you not the pasta was nearly inedible as it looked like canned pasta but tasted far worse. How they stay open we do not know. Oh, and the bread, not a word of a lie - the bread was 100% nasty. Stale and not to be consumed. A shame. The whole experience - a real shame. And the prices - a joke. We would not have thought twice had the food been worthy as we had hoped for in a mom and pop shop. It is becoming more and more difficult to find decent let alone spectacular restaurants in the GTA. Stay clear of Vesuvio when in Brampton. Your hard earned cash will thank you that you did."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went here because of the great reviews and I am glad we went here. It is just a small restaurant nestled in old Brampton and its easy to just drive passed it if you aren't looking for it.

The lightning is intimate and great for a romantic dinner with your significant other. There are separate rooms and in the other room there was a small party with a singer. It was loud at first but it grew on us, the singer was AMAZING. We never have experienced something like this before. The singer gave you goosebumps when he reached those high notes. 

On top of the great singing was the food, I had a pasta and my fianc√©e had a margherita pizza. Both were very good! I also recommend trying the tartufo, such a tasty dessert!

Go here, it'll be an experience you'll definitely never forget!"}
{"text":"Go here if you don't want good service...... Literally one waitress running the show......

You feel uncomfortable for her telling everyone else what to do...

Went on a Tuesday nite 6pm, and the reason you don't complain is because you feel sorry for her, but definitely the worst service"}
