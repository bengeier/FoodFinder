{"text":"The pizza tastes like greasy cardboard loaded with too much cheese and barely any sauce. It tastes worse than typical mall pizza. People say it's cheap but in my opinion it's too expensive for what it is. If you are looking for a good pizza place go right next door to Tomaydo Tomahdo. It's delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"This was a good pizza place. I wish they had more employees available to help with pizza and check on customers. I got the Captains special, which was pretty good! I would say that it's a close pizza joint if you want a slice or personal pan and the prices were definitely reasonable. I wish it was a little cleaner inside or had a better outdoor situation, but I would definitely consider going there again for lunch."}
{"text":"Went to Captain tony's today and waited nearly a half hour for a (what they call) large pizza to share between 2 other co-workers.  The pizza was not bad but for the price (21.00 that included 3 bottle waters) I would expect something better.  Next time I will walk a little further to vincenzos and enjoy a much better pizza and will be happy to pay for it.  Captain Tony you will not see me again as long as I can help it ( don't want to say  never and jinx myself )"}
{"text":"Pretty decent grab-a-slice pizza joint.  Crust is thick and chewy.  Round out the slice with a side salad and drink for $8.50.  This place is Sbarro-quality, not Angelo's."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes, I always enjoy the pizza and the price is very reasonable.

Previously rated them at two then three stars for issues regarding their Belly redemption issues and service.

All has been resolved for quite a while now and the customer service is excellent now.

The pizza has been consistently great.

Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"My favorite downtown pizza spot. The crust is thick and kind of chewy, though they do have NY style occasionally. I'm strictly a weekday lunch guy, and they usually have a pepperoni, cheese, and then rotate between sausage, BBQ, hamburger, and other alerted options. Consistently good, warm, and delicious.

I've also had them deliver a few pies to our office downtown and they're always on time and Stephanie is great over the phone."}
{"text":"Selling $10 'personal pizzas\" and luke warm cans of Coke for \"only $3\" during the parade for the Cavs victory. Way to gouge the customer. Oh yeah, and for that price we could not sit inside or use the facilities. Time to set sail Captain Tony!"}
{"text":"I've been working downtown for 3 years and this is my favorite downtown pizza stop.  Can't beat the $5 hot and ready pizza's during lunch!  They have a good variety of sandwiches and sides also, but I really can't NOT get the pizza when I'm there."}
{"text":"Great pizza by the slice for a quick easy lunch. Have had them cater and it was not bad, but not as good as when you go in the shop. And they close too early to be able to take it home for dinner!"}
{"text":"As far as Pizza Places downtown this is the best. I have ordered there deep dish peperoni and the cheese steak pizza. They are so good best deep dish around.  We also order there meat lover and veggy pizza  so good also. I will tell you this they make baked chicken wings and they are awesome. Great size and taste. The flavor is so good. Stephanie might be the only person that works there she is always the one that takes my order. She is phenomenal. Great personality and very nice on phone. Thank you for great service and quick deliveries at lunch."}
{"text":"Good pizza and when I was there the smoker was firing up some authentic smelling barbecue.  Partial to my Chicago Pie, and NY preference, but this is good stuff."}
{"text":"I walked in around 3:45 and the two employees sleemed pissed that I walked in. I ordered a slice of cheese it was cold soo I asked for it to be heated up and the girl smacked her lips. She turned on the oven didn't let the oven hear up before she put the pizza in. The HORRENDOUS service and the NEGATIVE attitudes are two of the many reasons this place is going down fast"}
{"text":"Very good pizza for a very good price would be my summary. This is very much a traditional pizza, but done well- consistently cooked, hot and fresh, and plenty of good tasting toppings. I eat here about once a week, as I work just down the street.

 The staff is friendly, honest and efficient. During peak lunch time, they get busy, but manage it quite well, and it is excellent to get a couple of slices just out of the oven. 

They also serve a very good deep dish, which is made in an unusual way; it is a sort of double decker deep slice with the lower portion filled with pepperoni, and then an upper layer with sauce, cheese and more pepperoni. This is not for everyone, and it is usually fairly greasy, but it is a fantastic take on the idea of deep dish.

We've also done take out for working lunch, and their whole pizza is nearly as great as \"by the slice\".

In summary, if you are in the area, get some pizza here; I would even reasonable rearrange a trip into downtown if I had a desire for pizza. You want to eat here, just go do it. The pizza waits."}
{"text":"I won't be coming back here for a number of reasons:

1. The guy behind the counter is not someone who seemed very happy to be there. He really wanted us to buy a slice of pizza but my co-worker and I ordered sandwiches instead. He made sure to warn us that it could take 15 minutes to make the sandwiches - it really didn't seem like he wanted to make them. I was about to learn that he should probably just stick to making pizza. I wanted a diet coke to drink, so I went to the refrigerator and got one from the bottom self. \"What's wrong with the ones on top?\" He asked with a pissed off tone. \"They're all cold\" he made sure to point out.
Uhh ok... I didn't know it mattered, I paid for a diet coke so I got one. I guess he was pissed because I was not going to buy his gnarly looking pepperoni or cheese pizza.

2. The sandwiches were not good. I got the Italian sandwich and my co-worker got the meatball sub. How hard is it to screw up these sandwiches? Not so hard I guess. My sandwich had a very small (maybe two or three slices) amount of meat. Under the meat was lots of tomatoes and lettuce that was wilted from when he stuck the sandwich under a broiler to melt the cheese. And then there was the cheese... My co-worker's meatball sandwich had an enormous amount of cheese. The first two bites were all cheese and no meat he said. He was pulling globs of cheese off with his fork to find the meatballs. Waste of $10. Subway next door makes a better sandwich by far. 

In conclusion, I won't be back to experience the bad attitude, bad sandwiches and even worse looking pizza."}
{"text":"Stop in for piping hot (like HOT) pizza by the slice for lunch on Rock and Roll Blvd. Always a nice variety available. Dining area gets packed quick but there are picnic tables nearby."}
{"text":"I wish I could speak on the food. wanting to make a delivery order, i asked if they delivered. \"yes, but only before 2 pm\" (it's 330). ok, understandable. I asked to make a pick up order, and I was put on hold for 5 minutes. after the employee came back on, she then told me I couldn't order because they close in 20 minutes.

again, I don't know how the food is, but please train your staff to be a little more courteous."}
{"text":"Captain Tony's is great - a thick heavy pizza with a good crust.  I have no idea why this place can not stay open on the weekends during the summer - there are plenty of people looking for some pizza during the weekends!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Captain Tony's for lunch with a co-worker recently. On this visit, we decided that Captain Tony's serves the best pizza in downtown Cleveland. We both had two slices of pepperoni for lunch with their $5.75 deal. You get two slices of pepperoni or cheese pizza and a drink.  Not a bad deal!

The pizza is hot and fresh because there are a lot of people eating it. There's always a fresh pizza coming out of the oven. You can't beat their lunch deal.

Yum!"}
