{"text":"The best Chinese takeout I've ever had. Consistently fresh, cooked to perfection, flavorful takeaway. Great service, never messed up an order...that's that."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I've ever had! I'm extremely picky and so is the rest of my family but we all love their food! It's definitely worth the price and their chicken and broccoli and sesame chicken are the best in Charlotte. I don't live anywhere near them but I drive 20-30 minutes for their food!"}
{"text":"Taipai is incredibly fast and definitely a worthy contender for our future takeout orders. We ordered the orange chicken and the general chicken. Both were listed as spicy on the menu, but we added chili pepper sauce and pepper to amp up the hotness. We agree with the other reviewers and would say this is a step up from standard takeout. Is it the best we've ever had? Not quite, but quite tasty."}
{"text":"Likes: Do not be fooled by the restaurant front or the name containing \"express\" - it is NOT fast food chinese. I had wrongly assumed that this would be chinese food like you would get from the mall but that is NOT the case! (I think fast food chinese is disgusting) This is high quality chinese food that you would get at any nice, sit-down chinese restaurant but designed primarily for takeout. You can dine inside but it is casual and with counter service. The food is great - my favorite is the steamed dumplings and spicy sa cha chicken. It is an open, very clean kitchen that you can see. Service is fast and they have never once messed up my take out order. 

Gripes: If you use soy sauce, be sure to ask for extra because no matter how much you order they just give you one packet unles you ask for more."}
{"text":"AWful. Worst food I have had in a long time. Every part of it was terrible. Two apps and two entrees, all really bad."}
{"text":"Not Delicious.

Mildly satisfying. Got the Scallion Chicken lunch special, Wontons, egg drop & wonton soup, and Shrimp Lo Mein. I normally rely heavily on my Fellow Yelpers but I was let down on this one.

The shrimp in the lo Mein tasted weird. And I was charged $.50 extra just to add onions...what descent Lo Mein dish comes without Onions???!!! SMH. The egg roll was dry and tasteless, the Scallion Chicken had a good taste, love the skinny Lo Mein noodles, but not enough veggies in it.  The soup was Very Tasteless...sad face! I had to ask them to add the green onions to it. 

Might possibly go back if I'm dying for sum Chinese around lunch time. Perhaps I'll try something in Garlic Sauce. Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"This is definitely our go-to Chinese restaurant since moving to MP. We like the crispy scallion chicken, fried rice and low main. The soups were great too! We will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"It seems like this place is always the lunch option for me and my coworker. The staff is very friendly and welcoming and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese foods places in charlotte. The service is always fast and their options are always light and healthy. The people definitely make the place ! They are always so friendly and kind!  I've tried a variety of items and they have all been great!"}
{"text":"I thought Taipei express was pretty damn good.  The shrimp in the Shrimp Lo Mien were plump and nicely browned, and there were plenty in my order.  The Sesame Chicken was juicy and the sauce was sweet and tangy.  I did not eat too much of the browned rice, but the chicken wings were crunchy, salty, meaty and tasty, especially with a splash of mustard and duck sauce.  The dumplings were massive, the biggest I've ever seen.  They were a little doughy, but the pork inside was nicely seasoned, and the sauce was delicious.  

The orders were large as well.  I ate my fill last night, and still had enough Lo Mien left to have a nice sized lunch today.  For the money I'd say Taipei Express is a great deal, true its not gourmet, but it is good... the portions are large and the prices are reasonable.  I have to disagree with Jason L. on this one and give Taipei Express a thumbs up, try it for yourself, and let us know what you think."}
{"text":"Gross...that's pretty much all I have to say about it.  The lo mein was actually chow mein, which seems to have become a trend for Charlotte Chinese food.  The egg roll was dry and I had no clue what was actually inside it.  They use styrofoam plates and plastic utensils, so definitely not enviro friendly.  It may be cheap, but there is a reason for that."}
{"text":"My friend is obsessed with this place and took me there while I was visiting. I had sesame chicken and it was wonderful. The take-out process is easy and the food was all delicious. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Charlotte two years ago, I didn't really know where to get good Chinese, and with some great Indian and Thai that I had found, I was able to satisfy my spicy Asian jones.

But then I was introduced to Taipei Express by some friends with more CLT experience, and really, I haven't found a better quick dine-in/carry-out place better. I mean Fortune Cookie was OK because it's cheaper, but paying a little extra really pays off at TE.

They give you huge portions, enough for a dinner and a following lunch. The appetizers and soups are all outstanding. Any kind of the chicken specialties are winners, but what really impresses me is any dish with shrimp or scallops on the spicy side. They give you a lot  of tasty pieces, and I also love the option of getting brown rice on the side instead.

Their dinners will cost just about $8-10, and if you're sharing, even less. That makes their heaping lunch specials super awesome.

I like the Taiwanese-Northern Chinese style of cuisine, and this comes through. Only thing is, it's got a really small dining area and an even smaller parking lot out front. So it's best for a lunch run from the office or a quick grab of a big meal on the way home from work."}
{"text":"Quick recap: bad customer service. Do not order any dish with breaded chicken. Ginger chicken is the dish to get if you find yourself here. Would not recommend this place to friends and family. 

There was very little amounts of chicken in the orange chicken. Mostly breading and very chewy. Rice was good, dumplings were nothing special. Sweet tea was pure sugar. 

When I tried to exchange my orange chicken for something else due to poor quality, they told me that was not possible.

This is a first for me. Never have I been told it was my fault for ordering something I didn't like. Even after I showed them the lack of chicken in the nuggets they told me there was nothing they could do."}
{"text":"Ok, It's a shame I have to do this... 1 Star!!! Wow! 

My go to Asian cuisine has become a disappointment the last 2 times. This is the last last time I'm giving them a chance. 

The broccoli just didn't taste right & was swimming in oil and Brown Sauce, even after requesting light brown sauce. I was so hungry that I ate a good bit of it anyways.  The rice and spring rolls were the only good tasting part.


Unfortunately, I felt nauseous after & my friend did shortly after."}
{"text":"The food here is not the same anymore... last night I cut into a piece of sesame chicken and it was the strangest thing I've ever seen. The middle was a little piece of chicken with this gooey white clear substance, like a filler, all around it. I am not sure what it was but I threw it all away.. unfortunantly I ate a little bit of it prior to cutting it open and now today my stomach is really hurting.. It's probably best if you avoid this place!"}
{"text":"If your kid brother threw on a chef's hat to play \"Chinese Restaurant\" for a day, this is what it would be like.  

The fried rice looks and tastes like regular rice with a splash of soy sauce and a package of frozen vegetables mixed in.  The stuffing in the spring rolls is unidentifiable.  The potstickers are a bready glob.  The sweet and sour chicken and sesame chicken are both dry and chewy.  

I can't imagine any of the more complicated dishes being better since the simple ones fell flat.  Which is why this restaurant gets a \"No!\""}
{"text":"I've always seen this place in passing but what sparked my interest in coming here was seeing a YouTube video by FungBros with Jeremy Lin. After, I was recommended this place by friends so I thought, I need to give this place a try. The staff is super friendly & haven't had an issue with any visit. You can really tell that this restaurant has their regulars & the staff has made an effort to get to know their more frequent customers. The actual restaurant is pretty small and the parking in front is a little difficult I always see people park next door & walk over. It was a Friday night that I went & it was extremely busy with takeout orders. I ordered the Sa-cha beef spicy with white rice & an order of chicken wings (6). You get the option to alter the spice as well as choose between white, brown or fried rice which I think is pretty awesome for a Chinese restaurant. The prices of the food are a little bit more expensive than the usual but as compared to others, for the quality & amount of food you get it's worth it. The dinner portions are able to feed 2-3 people. I've really enjoyed my food every time I come here and will continue doing so."}
{"text":"I eat at this restaurant at least twice a week.

This is the best asian fast food restaurant in town.  I love everything that I order there.  I am picky and like to leave out certain vegetables or change the sauce or alter the spiciness.  I have been able to do so and pleased with the outcome every single time.  In the hundred or so times I have been to Taipei Express (no joke) I have never had a bad experience. 

I wish there was room for them to expand and build an addition, but there isn't.  Also, parking is hard to come by.  I always park in the next door lot, even though it says office parking only.  To date I've never been towed.  Also, little know secret, there is parking directly behind the building...but only about four extra spaces.  

All in all, I am in love with Taipei Express.  MMM!"}
{"text":"Taipei, Taiwan, is my hometown, so it's a shame that I drove past Taipei Express several times and never dropped in until now.

I ordered the Kung Pao chicken, and I must say to my surprise, it tasted amazing, if not better than P.F. Chang's! Definitely not your typical \"carryout Chinese food\". The size of the portions are very generous, and I could only eat half of the plate, which meant great leftovers.

The staff was really nice, and I noticed that the dining space was very well maintained. The restaurant was very clean with comfortable seating areas unlike other Chinese restaurants. 

It's definitely worth ones time to stop by."}
{"text":"It is absolutely appalling that one of clearly the best Asian cuisines in Charlotte will not get rid of those styrofoam plates and plastic forks at least for the customers who choose to dine in!!! Other than that the food is EXCELLENT!!! When they get rid of the Styrofoam plates and plastic forks I will gladly give them give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Chinese food. Excellent and friendly service. Great vegetarian options. Large portions resulting in leftovers for home. We live in Texas, but every time we come to Charlotte we eat here at least once!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I came here for an early dinner and it did not disappoint. We shared the crab rangoon, which was amazing because they were actually filled with crab meat!! I got the beef lo mein & my husband got orange chicken. The serving sizes were surprisingly big AND delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You can tell when you eat fresh food. The taste, the delicate crunch of the veggies, and the look. Taipei Express masters the ability of providing fresh ingredients to make their food flavorful, satisfying and tasty.  While visiting Charlotte, we decided to visit this four-star Chinese restaurant. I'm puzzled why it has only four stars. We sampled the Mongolian Beef and the Chinese Vegetable entree. We were surprised at the quickness of our food delivered to the table. We we opened our covers, I knew we were at the right place. The beef was well-seasoned along with green onions. The sauce was perfectly balanced within the dish.  The Chinese vegetables were bright and fresh. Cooked just right, we ate the dish with delight.  This is a five-star establishment. Go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Pretty good and pretty fast! They give good portions and enough for left-overs. 

The space is pretty small, but you can dine-in. When I was there they stayed very busy and it seemed like a lot of people order-to-go. If you want the chili in oil, you will have to ask. I enjoyed the veggie lo mein and would be happy to go try more.

The parking directly in front of the building is limited. I think there is more parking next door (another shopping area). 

The woman who took my order seemed friendly and the staff was concentrating on making order after order. They seem to have a good groove going!"}
{"text":"This is a prime example of a restaurant that does not need to have ambience to become a local favorite. The food here is amongst the best Chinese food you can get and Charlotte. It is inexpensive and very tasty. Be warned, I ate here so much that I put on about 10 pounds over the course of 6 months. You can either order in or take out. It does get very crowded during the lunch time and is usually quite quiet during dinner. The owner is very friendly. If you ask not to have an eggroll included with your lunch, they will give you an extra scoop of rice at no charge.

There are a number of people who give this place a bad review. My question to them is what the heck? Where else in Charlotte have you found better Chinese food for under 10 bucks? I have been to this place probably 40 or 50 times. I have never seen any variation in their quality of food. I have also purchased food for my entire family and for parties here. Everyone was extremely happy with the food."}
{"text":"Very good food. I have tried several entrees and the are consistently well prepared and tasty. Their food is prepared to order. Staff is very friendly and service is fast. Very high quality food and reasonably priced for the Myers  Park area."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Service is always right on time when we pick it up! The vegetables seem very fresh and the flavor is authentic. They also give you good portion sizes and plenty of rice!"}
{"text":"Chinese take out ... Out of 5 places I've tried here ... I would definitely entertain another trip there. The lunch prices are great. I tried the pepper steak and onions lunch combo ( I chose fried rice and the egg roll). The egg roll was so yummy and crispy, not greasy at all :). The fried rice was okay...  But with some duck sauce made it better. My bf got the dinner special sesame chicken with fried rice. He enjoyed the chicken, but had the same thoughts about the rice. Also ordered egg drop soup and the crab rangoons ... And rangoons were deliicous... Would definitely get them again."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many of times. I normally get the eggplant lunch special but today I got  egg drop soup feeling under the weather.

Quick service! food is always freshly cooke! Sanitation score is 95 (which is good). Food is good 

Customer services is just ok could be better. 

Inside is small, 15 ppl will fill the place up. 3 tables for outdoor seating 

The worst part is the parking!!!"}
{"text":"Hunan Chicken close to 4 stars (I said close)!  Quality is a little better than most \"FAST\" food Chinese!

Fried Rice ok, almost 3 stars

Dude running this place is great, very polite and they are fast!  

Small Dinning Room 28 seats!  Bigger than I thought, I did not remember any Tables, though I bet they have always been there!

Outside two tables (6 seats)... No Shade, nor protection from Elements, though it would be a little work for a car to Run over you on this side (hardy-a-Patio) 

Tiny Parking lot 6 slots in front (Providence Road) hard to get in and out if you are going the wrong way at busy traffic times...  A few spots for Parking in the back though I do NOT recommend it!!! If you or your car slip (quite a slope) you could be in a Lot of trouble!  THINK before you Park! ! !  Forget Parking in the Lot beside Taipei unless you want to get TOWED ! ! !I think they are pretty serious about it!  Side Lot is Supposed to be ok to park  on Sunday, because all the businesses for that lot are Closed on Sunday!  Better Check!  You do NOT want to be Towed (I'm Guessing)!"}
{"text":"For Charlotte being such a growing spot for delicious food, we really don't have much in the way of Chinese food! thankfully we have Tai Pei! We love these guys! Not only is their food delicious, consistent, and ready in less than 10 minutes but they're so nice to every customer. They definitely know me by my first name, and always ask how my sister is doing! I recommend their crab rangoons (so delicious), their honey walnut chicken (sub cashews for walnuts) or their crispy scallion chicken, extra crispy with white meat. Definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"Whaaaat the heck!? All of there meat is shredded into a shape that's no longer recognizable...no wait, that's only half the time. That's pretty much the story with this place, half the time it's decent, half the time it's the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I've had it--I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Okay, so I did my research and tried to get the best Chinese food for a late night at work. I came across Taipei. I called in my order which they told me the total and the wait time which was around 10 minutes wait. I asked for something that currently isn't listed on their menu, but being a run of the mill Chinese place, I asked for Kung Pao chicken, and for $10 I get a huge two meal serving of chicken, with the amazing sauce that wasn't too thick or bready like it was fried too much. The chicken definitely stuck out to me, not your mushy greasy chicken I've seen at some places. The everything was awesome and I definitely agree that it is one of the best Chinese take out places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Having just moved to the area, I encountered this place via a recommendation and they ARE great! The food is super tasty, super fresh and very reasonably priced. I try a new dish every time I am there and have yet to eat a bad meal. I am so happy I have found this place!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to lunch spot here in Charlotte. Small parking lot in the front, but there is a larger adjacent lot to park. Having tried nearly everything on the lunch menu, I can definitely recommend the Sacha scallops, General Tso's tofu, and scallion chicken. For $6-7, you get a large portions with white or fried rice and an egg roll. Generally, the veggies are crisp and fresh. Chicken dishes are made from white meat. The sauces complement the meats and veggies well."}
{"text":"Best Asian food I've had in Charlotte. It's hard to come by good Asian good that doesn't leave you guessing what meat you consumed. I enjoy that, plus the food is really fresh. Love this place I crave it all of the time."}
{"text":"Charlotte isn't really known for its stellar ethnic food, but Taipei Express is good, solid Chinese food - nothing spectacular but a good meal for takeout or a quick lunch. I like Taipei Express's pork fried rice and Mongolian beef. For takeout, you can call ahead, but even if you go in and order, your food will be ready quickly."}
{"text":"GET THE CRAB RANGOONS!!!! 

They have the best crab rangoons I've ever eaten. I would totally recommend. 

The other food is great too!!!"}
{"text":"Taipei Express is good food. I eat here from time to time. Beef with brocorri always good. I also rike the beef and mix vegetable. I rove this place arot. Very crean very fast service. I give it 5star. Anything ress then sumsing Wong with u. I finish. I go now"}
{"text":"This is my go to chinese restaurant! I love the spicy mixed vegetables and the sweet and sour chicken. ITS REALLY CHICKEN TOO! lol

clean
friendly service

the cooks in the back are weird, they stare!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food in Charlotte hands down!  The sizes are family style so no small and large, but the flavors are amazing.  I highly recommend the crab ragoons, pan-fried vegetable dumplings, vegetable lo mein with red peppers added and sesame chicken.  Not a fancy place but perfect for a casual lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"My point of view is from a take-out stand point only. Customer service is prompt and friendly enough. I've always received my food hot. It is good chinese food but not great chinese food. It's easy with chinese places for everything to somewhat taste the same, just a different name and more or less vegetables."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Chinese food, it really doesn't get any better than this.  I get disappointed if I even think about ordering my Chicken w/ Broccoli from anywhere else.  As an avid fan of spicy food, it's tough to find any place in town that will satisfy my craving for heat.  If you tell Taipei Express to make it \"very spicy\", they actually make it very spicy!  Imagine that!  The place itself is relatively small, with very little parking.  The perfect take-out place--but if you're looking for a formal dining experience, this ain't it."}
{"text":"Love it here! Always consistent and they make the effort to know their customers. Took a long time after moving from NYC to find my go to but this is it!"}
{"text":"Living in South End the Chinese food options are quite limited (basically null) so I decided to drive a little bit out of the way this weekend to try this place out.  I ended up ordering take-out (seafood lo mein for me, broccoli and garlic sauce for the lady friend with two orders of fried rice).  Service was nice and quick; they said it would take about ten minutes when I got off the phone and when I got there 15 min later the food was ready.  Prices were very affordable and they looked to have some great lunch specials.  I will definitely be back and I look forward to trying some of the more traditional dishes as well."}
{"text":"For my wife and I, this is our go to Chinese restaurant in town. They are a model of efficiency and consistency, even of the food blends in with pretty much every other Chinese take-out you've ever had.

So the secret deal here is their vegetable soup- just a buck fifty and you get a huge contained stuffed with fresh veggies and plenty of tofu.  Even if you don't like tofu, take it our and enjoy the extra hot broth with the veggies.  Always a good starter.  Everything else here is pretty much what you know of Americanized Chinese take-out: choose your protein, choose your sauce, and let the good times roll in mediocrity.  Nothing too spicy, nothing overly flavorful, but the brown sauce is what it is and it is always what you've tasted before, so at least there are no surprises there

You'll notice most of their business is take out, though they do have a small dine in seating area you can use as well. Downgrade on the parking lot: is very tiny and can be dicey getting out of because it's directly on Providence. Still, a good go-to when you need food quick and don't want to both making these things yourself."}
{"text":"OK, OK... I'm giving a Chinese takeout a 4 but pay attention why...

1. Very fast and efficient service... when the belly begs for food they are ready!

2. The food is pretty darn good... the string beans are fresh and perfectly cooked, the tofu nicely browned (NOT mushy), sauces are AOK but just that.

3. I wouldn't go there to eat in their lil' eating area but it says EXPRESS on the sign!!! 

4. The real reason for a \"4\"? I'll be back there every time I want quick Chinese... there!"}
{"text":"Fantastic cheap Chinese food!
Really dug the shrimp and broccoli with fried rice. they gave rather sizable portions too--I.e. Have enough leftovers for a whole other meal.

Still need to try the egg rolls but great first impression."}
{"text":"It can be tough to find good Chinese food that is flavorful and not too greasy. This is it. The food was ready very quickly and everything seemed quite fresh. I had chicken lo mein, which was tasty and not drowning in oil. It had good amounts of fresh veggies with it as well. The beef and broccoli is excellent as well, although they could have used a bit more sauce. Overall, it's a good basic Chinese take-out restaurant that holds me over until I can get the really good stuff in San Francisco."}
{"text":"This no frills Chinese restaurant has been one of my favorites since I was a student at Queens in the early 2000's. The food is always hot, plentiful and fresh! I love the crunch of the veggies and the quick service. My favorite dish is the mixed veggies with chicken in garlic sauce. Their brown rice (only at dinner) is good. 

The only struggle here is the parking!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've ever had. You can tell it's all fresh and it's delicious. I ordered the garlic chicken and then the fried pork dumplings. The garlic chicken was fantastic. It's a great sized portion also. I didn't like the dumplings as much, but I didn't care because I'll just eat the garlic chicken. Dumplings tasted like they weren't done yet. I'll definitely order from here again!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Taipei Express for years, and they are consistantly stellar.  You can't help but notice how shiny and clean the kitchen is when you walk in- sparkly stainless steel from floor to ceiling.  A row of men in while aprons tossing food in & out of pans...fire flashing up, big woks spinning around... but that's not even the stellar part...  the truly stellar part is that in all those years, ordering at least once or twice a month, they have never ever gotten my order wrong...  not one time.  These people have an attention to detail that is to be admired.  We discuss it everytime we order from there.  
You can eat in there dining area, but it's small and the seating is not at all made to linger in, so we think it best to call ahead and take it home.  The food comes in these fantastic black plastic containers that do not spill or leak.  I really appreciate their thoughfulness in provinding above average to-go containers.  It's a huge portion of piping hot chinesey goodness, no matter what you order!  The rice comes seperate, white or brown.  Their egg rolls are yummy as are the crab rangoons.  
They're only a dollar or so more than fast food, and it's usually enough to allow for left overs  :-)  It's not flashy, and there are no koi ponds or paper lanterns, but it's solid, reliable, enjoyable chinese food."}
{"text":"i love this place, its my go to on sunday for chilling out on the couch before work on monday.  crispy scallion chicken extra extra hot with brown rice is my favorite.  pork fried dumplings are also really good and so are the spring rolls.  very consistent, very fast, and they have an extremely nice staff."}
{"text":"I want to say that I've been to Taipei Express before, but I think I would have remembered it.  Maybe I just thought about going.  Whatever the case, their sanitation score has dropped slightly - they are now at 97.5!  Naturally, they can take classes, so it might be slightly lower than that in reality.  But the place is clean.  It's actually really nice looking.  They even have a cool motion-activated water dispenser.  I don't know if that affects the food or not, but it's pretty neat.

The food is handed to you in a to-go clamshell, even if you ask for it to stay.  But that's not a big deal.  The real problem is that it's hot.  Not spicy hot, but hot from the grill.  It's probably better than not being hot, but it's just burning!  I had to sit and wait for ten minutes just to let it cool enough to be able to eat the stuff.

I'll also agree with others who said that the food was fairly indistinguishable.  Nothing much to it, really.  Not bad, not good.  Just there.  And lots and lots of sauce, which can mask just about anything - good or bad.  That, coupled with the hotness, was not necessarily a good thing.  It could go either way.  At least I scored two fortunes in my cookie."}
{"text":"I ordered on my home from work one day without really checking reviews so I hoped it wasn't terrible. I was very pleasantly surprised. It took about 8 minutes to get there any my food was ready in that time. I got beef and broccoli and general Tso's chicken. Both were very good! The best General Tso's chicken I have ever had! Staff was friendly and wasn't that expensive for the location...  9.35 for both."}
{"text":"Man, do they crank out some food in this place. I never call my order in, I always go to the store in person because I like to watch the action in the kitchen while I wait. Is that weird?

It's not fancy here. The restaurant is pretty small. The kitchen is always rocking. I came in tonight on a Tuesday and the phone was ringing off the hook. There were tickets everywhere on the line. The workers just kept cranking out food and to go orders. They tell you ten minutes, and it'll be ten minutes. The ladies at the register are always really nice. 

I always get egg drop soup. It's a must for me at every Chinese restaurant. I like the lo mein here because they put better veggies in it than other places. You know what I mean? Some restaurants use kind of like filler vegetables. I like the quality they do for the noodles here. My entree choice is usually different depending on my mood. My food is always still piping hot and steaming when I get it back home. 

The parking is not great. They have a pretty small lot. I always park next door if the other businesses are closed. I'm not sure what the rules are here. Taipei is probably closer to a 3.5, but I'll round up for good measure."}
{"text":"Our go to Chinese restaurant in the city. Great food, great service and super fast. 

Our favorite dishes are the ginger chicken, beef and broccoli and garlic chicken. Also they have top notch egg rolls. We've tried most everything on the menu and it's almost all outstanding. Each dish with its own unique flavor. The only \"downside\" is the fried rice...just a little too bland for my liking. 

Most of their business is take out though they do have a small seating area you can eat in at. The parking lot is very tiny and can be dicey getting out of because it's right on Providence. The owners are always working and very friendly. Great staff overall who always have smiles on their faces."}
{"text":"Taipei Express is the best takeout Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. They are very fast, friendly and cheap! Lunch specials run between $5-7 and are generous proportions while dinners are between $7-9 and could feed two. As for the food quality, this is my favorite Chinese food around. The crab rangoon is almost sweet enough to be a desert. If you come often enough you will likely see me sneaking out with some take out."}
{"text":"Love it. The best egg roll in town!! My husband orders three at a time!! 
Great, fast, convenient. 
They will alter the recipes, like less oil or. Ire broccoli, etc. 
we love it. Soups are good, dumplings are ok. Everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Good sesame chicken and crab Rangoon! I always get takeout. Clean and fast. Not too greasy and always good quality. A little pricey for dinner but it's worth it. Not huge portions, but still enough food!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best take out Chinese food you can get. It's always hot and fresh, and ALWAYS delicious. It's not your average take out joint. The staff is super polite and friendly.

All your favorites are here but better. My favorite is their chicken and broccoli or their Sweet and sour chicken. 

I will forever recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have to re-do my review after today's lunch visit.  The staff, well particularly one person at the front was very rude.  Not friendly or welcoming AT ALL. 

They have \"vegetable egg roll\" on the menu, which I ordered, hoping for a........vegetable egg roll.  Well instead, got a spring roll...not the same thing..please change the menu.  I hate spring rolls and the flaky thin outer shell.  Boo.  The lo mein, although a large portion, was somewhat tasteless.  They have chili oil that is bland, so it didn't help.  

That being said: $10.75...for poor tasting noodles and a spring roll that I didn't even want.  Yuck. Now I'm hungry still."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for take out. First experience was good. Second, not so much. I had the shrimp lo mein and I was not impressed. It made me question what kind of oil do they use to cook with and then why use so much on this noodle. I really wanted to like this second experience but as I am writing this, I feel like I might need a deep internal cleanse. Perhaps, this is a sign that I should stick to my clean eating diet. *sigh"}
{"text":"Stopped in here to satisfy a Chinese craving and yelp recommended. Honestly, I think it might go under as one of my top three Americanized Chinese spots in Charlotte. I did take-out, I did not eat at the restaurant itself. 

I went with the chicken in garlic sauce with white rice, and I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of chicken and vegetables I received. It was a very large and well balanced portion. The sauce itself was very flavorful, but not overpowering. It was certainly a dish that I would order again. 

I also got the dumplings (fried). They were a little heavy on the ginger, but it didn't take away from the overall dumpling taste, which was tasty. It also was a good blend of meat to dough, rather than the usually over doughy dumplings you find at Chinese restaurants.

I wouldn't recommend the hot and sour soup though. I love this soup, and this one was a clear miss in my book. It wasn't bad, it just lacked the flavor and bite I was hoping to get from a traditional hot and sour soup. 

Overall, I will be back again, and can't wait to try some of their other menu options."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today. I have to say it is really good quality Chinese food. I will be sure to make this restaurant part of my lunch routine going forward."}
{"text":"Had a cold this past week and by day three of being stuck in the house trying to recuperate I was done with soup and liquids and craving some comfort food. What is better than a cold night with Chinese take away and netflix? Nothing. 

So far in Charlotte I have been utterly disappointed with the Chinese options, Americanized or otherwise. Read that this place had decent reviews and figured I would give it a go. Ordered Orange Chicken with Fried Rice and Hot and Sour Soup. The Orange Chicken was what you would expect from an Americanized takeout place - the meat quality was good which is a plus because sometimes places skimp on that. The chao fan was decent too, but the hot and sour soup surprisingly had pork in it. Not a big deal as I am clearly not vegetarian, but I feel like they should disclose this as Hot and Sour soup is typically vegetarian. 

The staff were friendly, but seemed to judge me pretty hard for busting out my Chinese. Hey I like to practice as much as I can and if that means ordering Americanized sesame chicken and spring rolls in Chinese then so be it. At least I tried. 

I'll be back to try out other things, but probably at lunch time for half the price."}
{"text":"Taipei is simply my favorite Chinese food in town!! 
I mean, seriously. I am not lying to you, and it is hard for me to favorite things. They just have a great selection (vegans and vegetarians--do a happy dance) and it is always done well for takeout Chinese. I never eat in, always takeout. My favorite is the black bean tofu with brown rice and the vegetarian steamed dumplings...oh my GOSH....those are my obsession. I can eat the entire appetizer on my own. ADDICTING.

This cannot be an in depth review because my extent of experience is takeout...however... all you need to take away from this is the following:
Great food in the Chinese takeout world!
Fast service!
Sweet staff!
Addicting dumplings!!!!!
Central location for many neighborhoods to quickly get to!
Always answers your calls quickly and efficiently!
Addicting dumplings.... oh wait.... ;)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop for some really quick Americanized Chinese food. The portions are large and the food comes out of an open kitchen extremely hot. The only downside is there's really only one good dish for vegans/vegetarians - the excellent sesame tofu. It's cooked much better than most places and the thick cuts are actually nice here. Overall, a great dish, but minus one star for a lack of options."}
{"text":"Let's be clear. This is my favorite take out Chinese in America. I have to eat here whenever I'm in Charlotte. I don't know what is special about their food but it just tastes better than an other Chinese food. It is the measuring stick by which I judge all other Chinese food places. 

I almost always order the Chicken Fried Rice because it's amazing but I've tried plenty of their other dishes and have never been disappointed. I highly recommend the Crab Rangoons. They're crispy on the outside and soft and gooey in the center with the most amazing flavor. The dipping sauce they give you with them is stellar too."}
{"text":"It was okay. The server at the counter was more concerned with the call-in orders, which I guess is more common at this location due to the small amount of tables, but disappointing. It took me over 5 minutes to place my order. After being seated, with no one else there, I retrieved my order and was satisfied, but not impressed. The meal was very greasy & the rice and egg roll were so over-cooked. Won't bother again."}
{"text":"Might be the best value in Charlotte.  For about $8 you get your choice of Chinese dish, rice, egg-roll and a fountain drink.  Pretty decent bargain.

The food is good, not fantastic let's face it.  I'd recommend the General's Chicken, Sesame Chicken, and the Pork w Garlic Sauce.  I'd also stay away from the Sweet and Sour stuff - they mix it in for you, so you can't control the sauce to meat ration - bleh.

It's not the best Chinese food I've eaten, but then again, I've eaten a bunch of meals in China.  I would however come back and will continue to frequent the place."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little place! Very nice customer service and friendly faces to greet you and take your order. Whether it's for a pickup or a dine in, it's always a pleasure. The food is with no doubt great, keeping consistent everytime. Whenever I'm in the mood for chinese food, that's my go to place. I highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Taipei is the tiny shop on Providence near the confusing Providence, Queens catastrophe of an intersection.  It is a small place with an even smaller parking lot.  You are better off getting your food to go because of the limited seating and tendency of the restaurant to get overly hot from the kitchen equipment only feet away.

I found the food to be decent, but nothing over the top.  The restaurant wasn't particularly clean during my visit either.  The bathroom was unkept, the trash was overflowing, flies flew about, and an employee sat in the corner occupying one of the few tables, and two additional employees sat outside of the entrance; one, cigarette in mouth.

Trying new food is fun, but I like to have some idea of what I am eating.  The menu doesn't offer much in the way of English translation, so if you aren't familiar with the dishes, you are left in the dark.  In my opinion, the pricing was a bit much for Chinese takeout as well.

It's safe to say that Taipei was likely a one and done for me.  At least I can say that I've tried it.  On the upside, it is convenient to both Elizabeth and Myers Park residents looking to scratch their Chinese food itch."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place! Hands down the best Chinese food in Charlotte. Fast, affordable and sooo good. Also, the ONLY Chinese place that will actually make the food spicy. Not just add spice like other places, the food will actually be hot."}
