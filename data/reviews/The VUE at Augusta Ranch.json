{"text":"The food wasn't good. Shoestrings cold and over salted, patty melt was on a bun, pasta tasted weird, hamburgers over done, etc. Would not eat here again. All six of us felt the same way. Perhaps during the season it might be better?"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a server...then got up and left. Wanted to try a new place, but not if the service sucks  (& they weren't even busy!)"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and we had been raving about it to my n laws, we finally get them to meet us there tonight. We sat outside since the weather was great and unfortunately I think they forgot about us. We waited over an hour for our dinner which was bruschetta and salads. The food was great but took way too long for a night that didn't seem too busy. We will give it another shot since we live in the neighborhood and I really hope the service is better."}
{"text":"The view, service and food was awesome! Brilliant set up outside with tent and heaters. Server was knowledgable and so friendly. The Dip sandwich was delicious along with Potato Skins, Patty Melt and Sangria. Top it off with a game of bean bags... Perfect! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has the best patio experience in the east valley! Food is exceptional and the people are extremely friendly. I highly recommend a round of golf and a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Staff was wonderful. The pasta my daughter ordered was very good. Our wine-o fries were good but not impressive. They're shoestring fries sprinkled with what seems to be garlic powder. Still good just not worth the price. The manager is very helpful and sweet just like the other wait staff. Nice building but dark for being mid day. The outside seating is nice but hopefully will be updated to more lighting and seating in the near future. It could be a beautiful place. We will return again."}
{"text":"Sad to see a place I love so much turn so bad. This used to be the best place in town but it has turned. Employees no longer care... Management no longer cares. I hope they sell this place soon and turn it in to what it could be. Save your money and go to fat willys or bears."}
{"text":"I previously reviewed The Vue with either 4 or 5 stars, but my last three visits there have been ruined by flies.  I keep going back hoping they have them under control, but no luck.  I hope they get them under control, because the food and staff are still good, but I think I'll wait a while before I go back."}
{"text":"Great out door patio over viewing the golf course while you eat (or your welcome to sit inside). Got together with girls and had brunch. Food is delicious. We've also gone to have appetizers and drinks... I recommend the pretzels and cheese. Staff is pleasent. Anytime I've gone there's no waiting time. The place is nice, clean and easy access to parking. Overall great place to visit if your looking for casual dining with friends or family."}
{"text":"The Vue is alittle pricey & has a limited menu I have had take out that was cold  The dine in experience is better & did enjoy the meal. I have had the beef stroganoff 3 or 4 times and I really enjoyed it ..but not for take out. It was dry & cold  For a entree that ends up costing me $16 I would have liked to seen better ! The appetizers have always been good  The bacon cheese burger was dry but ok. Seems like sometimes it's dead & sometimes it's so busy the staff freaks out & that's when problems happen! All in all I like the Vue ..I would recommend it ..BUT it could go either way depending on staff"}
{"text":"I really like the setup and the view of the golf course. The food prices are too high priced for what you receive. I ordered the turkey Waldorf salad. The salad had about 0.5 ounces of turkey and two Apple slices. It tasted good, but for $12 not worth the money at all. It probably costs them $1 to make it. My friend ordered the fish and chips. There was only 3 small pieces of fish. The fries were good but the coleslaw was completely dry. It was the worst coleslaw we have ever had. Once again for the portion size not worth the money. The server seemed to be really new. When our food arrived a manager brought it out and our drinks were empty so we asked her for a refill after 15 min our waitress came back and filled our drinks. The manager completely forgot and finally brought us more drinks while we were paying. If I ever come back I'll just sit at the bar and order drinks. I will not order food again."}
{"text":"You don't have to live on the golf course to enjoy The Vue! I love sitting outside on the patio with friends and family enjoying the drinks, food, and the view. Some of my favorite things...the pretzels and cheese dip, pot roast sandwich, and breakfast on Sunday's."}
{"text":"My family and I just had Sunday brunch here. The costumer service is excellent. The Chef, or owner not sure, came out to check on us. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. However, the breakfast wasn't that great. My husband got the enchilada omelet- not much flavor, no flavor with the enchilada sauce. I got the Mediterranean sctamble- no flavor and watery. The breakfast potatoes were soggy, not crispy at all. In conclusion, I don't recommend those two dishes. Finally, the mimosas were orange juice with a slight splash of champagne. We most likely won't be going back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Good service, good meals they have a limited menu but plenty to keep all happy! Wings are great, our kids love the boneless wings. Drinks are always full, and it is from the bar they do a good job of making sure you don't get thirsty. Kids love the pretzel app."}
{"text":"Great location, great food, great service. We love, love LOVE this place. I frequent The Vue often and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Chef's Board\" got Oscar Meyer........don't bother!"}
{"text":"Golf on 2 different leagues at Augusta and love the course and persons managing it, and the clubhouse staff. However, The Vue Resturant has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The staff including management need to take a lesson on how to treat customers especially league customers whom spend continually (big $$) twice weekly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have become regulars here over the last few months, and always have a great experience.  We watch games at the bar occassionally, but usually sit outside and enjoy the patio.  We like the cheese boards and wine, and also try to come for the Wednesday special of wine and bruchetta.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews, but I had such a great time at The Vue, and I wanted to share the experience. We brought an out-of-town family member for dinner there last night and all five of us were very pleased with the entrees we ordered and the service.The portions were surprisingly ample and delicious. (I was able to sample several.) Sitting on the patio enhanced the experience as it is nicely decorated and very comfortable. I'll be returning soon to order some of the other menu items I only sampled."}
{"text":"Not bad. Had an item on the specials menu. Seemed like a pot pie. Only complaint was it wasn't that hot. Came out warm. Too bad because it would have been a good dish"}
{"text":"Great food and a great time! Also, the Brunch on Sunday is perfect way to start the day!"}
{"text":"I went here awhile back with some friends. I really enjoyed sitting outside and the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great local place with amazing patio with views of the lake, golf course & mountains. Plus full bar and restaurant seating areas. Amazing food and service & Sunday Brunch plus weekly specials to keep you on your toes. This is a Restaurant on a Golf Course NOT a Golf Course Restaurant...must check it out and its open to everyone...."}
{"text":"Again would give a zero if I could.   Was very excited for this to come back with a facelift, but unfortunately they hire horrible managers who are unaware of their rudeness and lack of customer service. Love to come here with my husband and kids on Saturday or Sunday mornings to eat, but this last time a few weeks back the manager was so rude. We were one of maybe 2 tables outside and the waitress instructed us to sit wherever. Our kids chose the couches. Halfway through the meal the manager came up to my husband and asked if we had more people joining us. My husband answered no, the manager proceeded to tell him well we save this area for a waiting area not for meals!  Excuse me?! You walked past us for the last hour there is no one in the place and you want to say that?! If you don't want people sitting in the area you need to direct the waitress to indicate that in the beginning. How dare you and your failing restaurant make customers feel bad for something.  Yes, this is owned by the HUB but they don't run it correctly and will continue to go downhill with customer service from a manager like that! So rude"}
{"text":"The Vue is walking distance from our house, so we're there often. We bring our dog and hang out on their big ol' patio area. Great place to relax and enjoy good company, friendly service, and terrific food! Major props to the chef, as well as the entire staff. We LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"And another awesome perk! I came here for Mother's Day and they gave me a free glass of champagne and a beautiful carnation flower. Such great customer service! Also, I love when they switch up the menu. You're never disappointed when you try something new."}
{"text":"We had our company Christmas party here and it was amazing!  Not only was the food good, but there were so many other things to do as well. We played giant connect four, giant Jenga and corn hole, all provided by the restaurant. It was by far, our best Christmas party and the staff, food, and atmosphere were incredible. I totally recommend this place to anyone looking for great food, service and fun."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but the Vue is trash. It feels like they don't even care that they've become horrible because they know that they are in a convenient location with limited options nearby, and they are counting on people to accept the slap in the face of a crap dining experience in exchange for a nice view and semi decent atmosphere. We would love to come here if you guys just tried a little. One year ago it was good, the menu was okay, the atmosphere was nice but not anymore. They keep changing the menu, and every update is worse then the last. The options are all over the place and unappetizing. Not only are the selections mediocre but the food is down right bad. Flavorless, greasy, and uninspired. Costco does a better job with putting out samples.  I had a French dip sandwich that was so bad I had three bites and tossed the whole thing. They had onion rings which you could rely on, but they've taken that away and now serve the onion straws meant to top burgers or green bean casserole as a side dish. They have no options for anyone vegan, and limited vegetarian dishes unless you count the dry veggie flatbread. Is it too much to ask for a basic veggie burger? Burger King has veggie burgers. We've wasted many dollars here hoping that this place won't suck as it's conveniently in our neighborhood but are constantly disappointed. The managers are wasting the is awesome patio space and location. Tips to get better: stick with a simple menu meant to please the average crowd. Straightforward yet tasty appetizers (see any local sports bar). Add a simple veggie burger or black bean burger for the vegetarian/vegan community that is growing, expect one in every group. Perhaps a veggie taco if you choose mexi-inspired options. Veggie wrap? Quinoa/veggie bowl? Bring back real onion rings. Throw in a simple chicken or steak dish with some veggie/potato sides for your golfers or neighbors who would like a solid dinner. Keep your ranch dressing as is. Figure out what dishes fit your restaurant that you can cook rather than serve from the freezer. These are just my ideas. My best advice is probably to read your reviews and send out a survey to your neighbors in Augusta Ranch or your golfers and say, \"hey, we know we suck, but we're trying. What would you like to see at the Vue? We appreciate your business\". This place is within walking distance from our house, we would love to stop by at least once a week for food/drinks/socializing. please make that a desirable option"}
{"text":"I can't say how the food or service is.  We tried to eat there,  but apparently they close the kitchen from 3 to 3:30.  Seems like a pretty poor policy for a small restaurant tucked into a neighborhood to be okay with losing a potential customer."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to meet up with friends for a friday happy hour..Food and drinks were great.The service was very friendly . Definitely will be back again"}
{"text":"I love this venue! Its a super casual and relaxing eatery located on the Augusta Ranch Golf Course. The menu is mostly Mexican. If there were a downfall it would be that there is no breakfast served on Saturdays. Pricing is about $10/person and portions are large. I hear they have a good happy hour menu although I haven't visited during happy hour. Staff is friendly and helpful and the facility is clean. Will be back to check out happy hour!"}
{"text":"They are great!  The service is fantastic.  The food is excellent, I have never been disappointed with anything that I have tried! I feel very lucky to have them in our neighborhood Ruthie Piasecki"}
{"text":"Amazing! We hit the lottery moving into Augusta Ranch and finding this place. We can walk to one of our favorite restaurants. The Dry Rub Wings are the best wings in my opinion. Haven't had anything on the menu we didn't like. They have the best staff, everyone is so nice and makes the experience even better. Great outdoor patio with an amazing view. Very reasonably priced and they have a very talented kitchen. One of those places you can ask them to make it a little spicier or just have a special request they're always able to do so. Can't brag enough about this place. If you haven't been you're missing out."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in last night, our first visit. Everything was great, especially the staff. Super-friendly place with a quiet, low-light ambience. Located right on the golf course. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This isn't really a one star review it's to let everybody know that this place is permanently closed. Went by this morning to have Mother's Day breakfast there and there was a sign on the door saying that they had permanently closed."}
{"text":"Nice place on the golf course for lunch. I had the Cobb salad. I love Cobb salad but this one had field greens not chopped up and no egg.  It was ok but I left over half of the greens   Every time I had a bite the greens stems got dressing all over my face. Probably will not go again. Wait staff and good."}
{"text":"I highly recommend checking this place out! Great view and great menu. Sunday brunch is one of my favorites! Be sure to look at the wine list too. The have wonderful service! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is a converted clubhouse on the golf course and its really nice for happy hour or a night out. My husband had also been here for lunch and said its just as great. The drink menu is creative & different. Try the Arizona Mule! The special was a surf & turf with sea scallops & steak, with Manhattan Sauce. The steak was perfect! The scallops were amazing & fresh. And the sides were green beans & madalion potatoes, all really tasty!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot, tucked away in a residential part of Mesa, offering a good wine selection, attentive service and great background music.   Looking forward to trying out their food on my next visit."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to meet up with friends midway from each other and The Vue popped up. I am so glad we decided to give it a try! The management and servers were amazing. The smoked wings were unbelievable and our dinner were terrific! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"What the heck were they thinking?!?!? They change up the menu and it stinks they changed the vue philly and the french fries and the belt and it's garbage.  This was a place you can go have a great time a nice cold drink fantastic food and amazing service all that still exists except for the food part so don't go hungry."}
{"text":"Beautiful place! The best food! Staff is amazing! Great for families! The French dip and French fries are the best thing on the menu, so good!!!! And don't forget to try there peanut butter bacon burger :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out with golf pals after a round or just come by for lunch!  Staff is always friendly, professional, and attentive without being intrusive. Food is served with nice presentation, hot and delicious every time!  Watched as the bar staff made up the bloody Mary pre-mix from almost-scratch, squeezing fresh citrus...who does that?  Conclusion, this place has the service, food and atmosphere of a more upscale club without the upscale attitude or pricing!  By the way, the bruchetta plate is heaven!"}
{"text":"They had NO soup and NO sald available. The fish I ordered was 3 small, thin pieces. The cole slaw tasted like it had perfume in it. This was the 2nd time we tried The Vue, and it was sad both times. My wife could only eat a few bites of her chicken wrap because it tasted like grilled processed chicken and had mo mayo or anything on it."}
{"text":"We tried the VUE for lunch. The menu was varied - burgers, salads, Mexican, etc. service was very good and friendly. Being a chilly weekday, it was fairly quiet. It looks out over a small golf course. The place was very clean and comfortable.   They have live music at 7 pm on Saturdays   out on their patio.   We had the grilled cheese (very good grainy bread w lots of good cheese, w very good tomato soup) and the fried chicken fingers (good but standard, cole slaw better than most).   We'll be back on Saturday to see how that goes."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, good servers. Love dining on the patio but dislike eating inside; so incredibly noisy.  It would be good to change up the menu a bit."}
{"text":"Just went to The Vue for the first time with my boyfriend. We wanted to try somewhere new. Unfortunately, a couple places that sounded great had hour long waits. So we came here. First, no wait. We got to seat ourselves right next to the golf course (where golfers were hitting glow in the dark balls since it was nighttime). We were greeted by Chad, the general manager. We told him we found them through Yelp and it was our first time there. He told us about their menu and was straight up that a couple specials were sold out. He was very nice and seemed very excited for us to be there. As a thank you he came back with a free appetizer, which was delicious.   As for our food and drinks we had the vue board. Very delicious starter. I had bruschetta as the entree, which was incredibly good. Until I tried my boyfriends sandwich, which was even better. The fries were perfection as well. My sangria was exactly what I wanted as well.   Overall great vibe, quiet, and nice atmosphere with even better food and staff. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Menu and price points. Food quality excellent .Chad the GM stopped by our table and is very passionate about his Restaurant!! THis was our 4th time at the Vue and we have had a tremendous food experience each time.Will continue to tell all of our friends!!"}
{"text":"Went Saturday with my girlfriend to this place.  What a wonderful experience.  Ashley our waitress was super friendly and went out of her way to make my sandwich just the way I like it (thanks a lot).  The scenery was beautiful and both our lunches were great.  Felt prices were in line with every other place.  Try this place, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"They dont let me give zero  The waitresses and management here are very hostile and dont care a bit about customer service.  I will never go there again after golf, Fat  Willeys on Baseline and Crismon, or Papa  Bears on Ellsworth and Baseline are more than happy to serve you with a great staff that appreciate your business.  We live in the neighbourhood and will never go back there to eat and will ensure our treatment is known to all.  And dont go to the Hub on Baseline and Sossman either as same owners who obviously approve of their staffs treatment of customers!  Shame, shame on you!  The Bartender is the most aggorant person I have ever come across!"}
{"text":"Kitchen closes at 8pm so if you plan on coming for dinner show up early as this is the 2nd time we have been told to sit down at a table only to have the manager come over and tell us the kitchen is closed. They need to revamp their website to reflect the kitchen hour's as it varies from day to day. Piss poor service."}
{"text":"We found this place on a whim after leaving the mesa flea market. We were just looking for a nice place to eat a small meal before we drove home.  The Madison Board was just the right size for two of us and the price was reasonable. Great setting and beautiful view of the golf course.  The waitress was super friendly and helpful by explaining the different choices and she was very attentive.  It is in a housing development but is open to the public!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place tucked away in Augusta Ranch. The menu looks awesome, but I've just had their pretzels.  They have the same smoked wings from the Hub, so those will be good. Good beer and wine selection, and a huge patio overlooking the golf course. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Good food, good patio. Had a tiny little problem with take out order, and I didn't want to go back due to weather. Manager came to me!!!! Can you believe it. I am so happy we have a real restaurant in our community!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and everything was delicious. We sampled a few different things and it was all very good. The chef's special red pesto cheese curds were just delicious! The smoked wings were very good as was the bruschetta. The pretzels and cheese were also very good and fresh. We would highly recommend this place and we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Glad we found this place!  I partially do not want to write a review, because I want to keep this place all to myself.  Great service, great scenery, breakfast was good.  We will be back to try the wines and bruschetta soon."}
{"text":"Awesome patio :) Great food, service and atmosphere ... Love that it's right in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good place. Wife piece and I had a coupon to use. Stumbled upon a good place to eat at. The wings are literally fall off the bone goodness. Staff super friendly the the view at the vue isn't too shabby either. Recommend to anyone that wants a calm place that isn't overly noisy."}
{"text":"The bartender is the only excellent aspect to this place. She was attentive and sweet! My husband got the carne asada burrito that was primarily beans and rice. He had to hunt for steak and we literally, cut the burrito in half and used a fork to dig through to look for the 1 tiny piece of potato that is advertised as being in it. I got the shrimp from the appetizer menu and while they give you a ton, the tartar is gross. It looks like a tartar sauce that's been out too long. Everything was over-cilantro'd.  I read this place was closed and re-opened. Being that I live in this area, I was so hopeful."}
{"text":"Love the vue! Outside is best. The kids can play. The food is amazing & staff is super friendly & nice. Our new family hang out!!"}
{"text":"Wow, The Vue used to have a great view, good food, and not so good service.  The last 3 times coming here, the prices have gone up, the food quality has gone down, and the service is mediocrely better.  Thankfully the view is just as wonderful.  I guess that's the premium we pay.  I wish the owners would invest in the quality and value."}
{"text":"I had the best experience a parent could have at a restaurant. My son who is 2 was done eating and wanting to get up and I hadn't finished my food yet. The waitress Hanna started playing with him, she went out of her way to entertain him, she brought him stuff to color and colored with him, she play chased him back and forth like he wanted her to, he danced with her and hugged her. She was the best! So friendly, suggestive, even made the effort to get to know you personally. Plus I've tried tacos at many places being new here and this place by far had the best chicken tacos I've ever had. Go! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Go for the great short golf course and stay for bar food with a waterside view. Chicken tacos (3) are recommended. Attentive service!"}
{"text":"If I wish I could give this place ZERO STAR. I stepped in the restaurant and saw the sign \" please wait to be seated\" . So I waited and waited and waited and watched. The staff walking by.The sign is next to the bar and the bartender saw me standing.. she just ignored me even I was 1 foot away from her. So I kept Standing there. Until someone walked right pass me again so I decided to say something. I told her I that I was waiting to be seated so she went to grab someone who told me that I had to wait 30 mins for the table.so I walked out.  I will not go back there ever again. No customer service whatsoever."}
{"text":"Great specials, great food, great drinks. What else do you need? It's tucked in a corner on the golf course in the neighborhood. But don't mistake t for some country-club-membership-paying place. It has the class without the exclusivity. Very fun"}
{"text":"The Vue is hands down the best place in 85209 and east of the 202. No matter what meal you go to have, most everything is so amazing. I keep trying new places but nowhere comes close. Price is right. Atmosphere is great as I mostly ear outside overlooking a lake a golfers. It's beautiful. Best french toast I've ever had if anyone can find better let me know. Dog friendly too! Doesn't get much better!"}
{"text":"My small group and I wanted to check out something new with a patio. And boy did the Vue deliver! Fantastic outdoor seating! I had trouble finding items to accommodate my difficult vegan gluten free dietary restrictions but Chris (GM) went above and beyond to help me out. He got an idea of what I like and had the kitchen literally invent some delicious bruschetta bites for me. Wow! The guys at the table tried the watermelon smoked wings and were impressed by how good they were! We will absolutely be back to enjoy the patio, amazing service and good food!"}
{"text":"Surprise early Mother's Day lunch. What a fun vibe. Beautiful day, nice comfy outdoor seating a great meal. All four of us had the same meal-- the dip. Delicious!  My new hangout!"}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible service.  If it weren't foe the view of the golf course it would be zero.  It took 30 minutes to get a drink and there is only 4 people on the porch."}
{"text":"Great location, food and service. We sat out on the patio for lunch with the kids and enjoyed every minute. Server was friendly and fast. I had the jalapeño burger with Vue chips, it was too much food but very good."}
{"text":"We absolutely love it here, the atmosphere and staff are great.  (Shout out to Dawn, you were awesome !) The Sunday brunch menu includes $3 Bloody Mary's and Mimosas. Live bands on the weekend and alcohol specials throughout the week. Most definitely a hidden gem. I would recommend the Route 66 breakfast, delicious along with all other menus items."}
{"text":"Love it! Nice to have patio dining with a pretty view and awesome food!!! We'll become regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"Still love this place. It's awesome for kids. Our boys told us today it's their favorite restaurant.  The whole atmosphere is relaxing and lovely."}
{"text":"The Vue is owned by the Hub and normally has a similar menu. Stopped yesterday after golf and they were busy. Had wait staff galore pretty much standing around. We ordered our meals and waited 40 minutes and then asked how much longer and were told 20 more minutes. We had ordered biscuits and gravy and chicken wings. This is the second time we have seen this type of service. Not sure why the Hub does not fix it.  If you want this type of food go to the Hub where the service is excellent and the wings are better."}
{"text":"Update 5/4/18. It is almost 11 pm and the loud mouth cornholer is echoing across the landscape. Get a clue Vue! Your restaurant is in the middle of a neighborhood. The food is great. The service is good. On Saturday nights, however, there is a consistent loud mouth that yells obscenities while playing corn hole and drinking. I would be happy to update this review to a higher score if you can maintain a sense of decorum among your patrons!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at the Hub and the same owners started this new restaurant. Atmosphere is nice with a much more limited menu. I tried the fish and chips and was not impressed. My wife had the pretzels and enjoyed them. The wine selection was pretty good and on recommendation of our friendly waiter we enjoyed a wonderful red. I hope they bring on a pan fried New York steak or something a little more in tune with my carnivorous palette.  I understand they are probably lacking space in the kitchen, but burgers and chicken fried steak are not going to cut it for me. Atmosphere is casual (shorts and a golf shirt work fine, parking is ample and prices are reasonable. I'll probably watch for a change in the menu and if I see that happens, I will be back for a second try."}
{"text":"What a gem! Great food, atmosphere, and service. The boards and bruschetta are wonderful!"}
{"text":"We have been to the VUE for breakfast quite a few times and for dinner once or twice. It's really enjoyable. The food is delicious and we have always had great service. The dining room ought to feel small but because of the rolling hills of the golf course, the porch and the windows it feels spacious. It's really nice to eat outside in the evening on the covered patio with the lights."}
{"text":"AND WE'RE BACK!! The Vue was closed over the summer to revamp the menu and overall experience. We really missed our neighborhood hangout and were really excited to go for the sneak peek last weekend. The menu is a new concept for them. As much as I was bummed to see my favorite Vue board gone from the appetizers, I kept an open mind and ordered the chips and salsa. These were great and really fresh! Do yourself a favor and get a cup of queso with it--BOMB!!! This was the best queso I've had in a while.  The rest of the menu consisted of a more Mexican theme, with California style burritos and street tacos. I tried the southwest cheesesteak and the meat was delicious! Everything we tried was perfectly seasoned. My unadventurous father got the chicken strips. I scoffed at first, but good lord, those were amazing! The breading was homemade and the chicken was juicy! All in all, we were very impressed with everything. The service was awesome and very welcoming. We really enjoyed our time this weekend and am looking forward to this new and improved Vue."}
{"text":"We sat down in the patio area and ordered tea which came pretty fast but it was downhill after that. We never saw our waitress after 15-20 min and the gal that seated us walked by us three times and never said squat to us. We drank some of our tea and left. Must be relatives putting all the stars on this place. What a joke. Hard to find good help anymore. The place only had two couples there!!!"}
{"text":"New menu is terrible; wait staff doesn't have a clue what customer service is. Any taco shack would out shine this \"new\" VUE"}
{"text":"I really really want to like this place.. after their lengthy closure to rebrand they somehow managed to get worse.  First the good.  I love the vibe and golf course view.  Either outside or inside they both offer a good experience.  The bartenders are attentive and friendly inside.  Waitresses are generally good.  Drinks are mixed well and the beer has always been good cold for me.. now the bad.. the food.  I've been told this is the same management as the Hub and if so wow I can't believe they've let the standards slip so bad. My last visit we started with fried zucchini.  It comes out and breading is very dark.  I cut it in half and the zucchini is dark.  Dead give away these are not made fresh but are frozen.  They are mushy and flavorless.. next I try the Vue Mac and cheese.  It comes out and the noodles look dry.  I attempt to eat it and again the chicken and bacon we're obviously precooked and was flavorless and dry.  All in all it taste like something you'd get from the freezer section of your Grocery store.  Not horrible but not inspiring enough to make me want to return.  I left unsatisfied once again.  If they can't make their food fresh there is no reason to patronize this place.  I might stop in from time to time for a cold beer but I'm done trying to eat here.. too bad because I wanted it to be one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I was working an event at the golf course and needed a quick bite to eat for lunch! I curiously stumbled into The Vue not really knowing what to expect. My first impression was WOW! What a menu! And my next impression was HOLY SMOKES this food is awesome! Fast AND good - this is a rarity. I'm not in Mesa often, and not at golf courses often. But I would make a special trip to come back here. I got carne asada tacos - really good portion size for not that much $$$. The house made chips I chose to pair it with were sinfully good. I need this meal again in my life / need to try more things on their gigantic menu! Great experience, thank you The Vue!"}
{"text":"Checked out The Vue at Augusta Ranch today and I was not disappointed!  Great atmosphere with a great view of the golf course. I tried the smoked wings... and let me tell you... the wings were REMARKABLE!!! I love wings and these were by far the best I have had to date! They have really tasty chicken street tacos and feel in love with The HOUSE Steak .. filet mignon seared and skewered over a bed of steamed spinach, crimini mushrooms, roasted red peppers ... this entree was incredible..even down to the veggies. And I have to tell you, I don't care for the taste of veggies at restaurants.  They seems to taste funny. Nope... not this dish. I just wish I had more!!! Both my mother and I thoroughly enjoyed his meal!!! (I have a couple of pics... not the best shots in the world, but here they are)."}
{"text":"Brand NEW place. Set @ The Augusta Ranch Golf Course. My wife and I have been in 4 to 5 times since it opened. Friendly and courteous staff. The menu has a good assortment of items to choose from. The French Soup is wonderful. The Bacon cheese burger was great too. Skinny fries are tasty too. The atmosphere is awesome and a huge upgrade from the previous establishment. Nice custom made patio seating outside and a large bar inside allows you to pick your type of experience. Looks like a Bloody Mary/ Mimosa special starting Jan.4. Only missing... a HH for the locals. Coming soon, I bet..."}
{"text":"Great, cozy place to hang out with family, friends & even your dog. Friendly staff & delicious food. I like that the staff took care of my dog by giving him a bowl of water. We'll go to any resto which welcomes our dog."}
{"text":"Great view of course and food is great as well. Steve is an amazing manager and always remembers us by name and makes us feel welcome. Would have given 5 stars but sitting inside is missing something (not sure what) and they only have 1/2 orders of the smoked wings."}
{"text":"At a golf course in a neighborhood. Salads were wonderful.  Wings were excellent!. Smashie was oily but fries and fish were great. Bruschetta toppings were good but bread was dry not just toasted. View was great but pesky flies kept bothering us."}
{"text":"This is a really awkward restaurant. It feels like you are an unwelcome guest in someone's living room.  No air circulation so very stuffy in the dining room. Beer was warm, food was mediocre at best. Meh."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  I wish I found this local spot sooner. We ordered the wings, the secret, a steak dish and pasta Diablo all of which were tasty. My friend said it was the best pasta he has had since living in Italy for 2 years. Also has a great selection to choose from at the bar and priced well. Make sure you save room for some of the local ice cream it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service. I came here with my 9 yr old son for a late lunch and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. This is now on his list of places to go!!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at the VUE a few times and the food is FABULOUS. The chef is awesome. The food was very flavorable. You must try them out. Chad does a great with the food and service."}
{"text":"Service is super friendly. Kitchen is fast. I love the outside atmosphere. The menu is fun always changing. My fave is Wed wine and bruccetta all day for $20"}
{"text":"The VUE has excellent customer service and wonderful food.  The VUE is a hidden gem in the neighborhood.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place after a round of golf. The patio is great, and I'm obsessed with the exploding potatoes !"}
{"text":"This place has everything you're looking for. It was a lovely day so my party and I decided to dine on the spacious patio. We were not disappointed! Friendly service paired with a world class menu made for a unique dining experience. Having spent two years in Italy, I was in search of some quality pasta. The VUE's pasta Diablo exceeded all my expectations. Expertly prepared with a delightfully spicy sauce, this dish was the best pasta I've had since leaving Florence. The restaurant comes with a fully service bar and they were happy to prepare an expertly crafted Gin and tonic for a warm Arizona fall day. If ever you find yourself in east Mesa, stop by the VUE at Augusta Ranch and be pleasantly surprised by a delicious menu and superb service!"}
{"text":"We ventured in here after a round of golf. Nice atmosphere with mix of golfers talking shop and locals. Great patio overlooking 9th and 18th holes with water features. Service was great with friendly and attentive staff.  They have good variety of beers on tap. But the chicken wings were what set this place apart above all else. Both the honey hot and Thai chili were amazing. Falling off the bone with goodness. Only bummer is they ran out and it was going to be another half hour before fresh ones were available. I can definitely see why they ran out though.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great patio and wonderful food. The white wine sangria was tasty and all of our meals were delish. My daughter and I shared the goddess salad (could use a bit more apple/strawberries) and the Vue steak sandwich with Vue potatoes - YUM. Others ordered the BALT, fish and chips,2 different kinds of burgers, the pot roast and the dip. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Oh - The pretzels were the bomb. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Once again very impressed with The Vue.  We had a very special graduation dinner for my husband with our out of town guests and everyone had a fantastic time.  Plenty of space for a large party.  They even gave us a complementary champagne toast.  Thank you for a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"A definite four stars. I'd like to give it more but there are no half stars and it didn't make it to five. Minor problem with cold food but the manager took care of that immediately. The food was good and presented well. They had entertainment. A singer by the name of Ian Eric. He introduced himself as Harley Davidson, and was very good. I'd go back just to see him."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! Good drinks and service. The wings were great, the meat came off the bone. Bruschetta was ok but the burgers are great. We're definitely coming back. Kid and dog friendly."}
{"text":"Found the phone number on YELP ... very very pleasant person took our reservation and table was ready when we got there which was 5 minutes!! Great food great service!! We were inside but plan to come back and eat outside. The Vue potatos are the best!!"}
{"text":"No Coffee on Sunday Morning! 3/4 of our meal came out wrong! Was told a manager would be over several times and never saw one! We told the server to please not re-make our meal but they couldn't even follow that simple requests! Just down right disappointed and still hungry!"}
{"text":"I go all the time for their Wednesday deal of $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta! Great deal and their bruschetta is awesome! I especially like their shrimp bruschetta and pear bruschetta!"}
{"text":"I only go here for drinks and the atmosphere. The food is overpriced and everything I've ordered has been very disappointing. The service is very slow, if want to get your drinks fast you have to go up to the bar to order."}
{"text":"Walked in around 1 pm to a sparsely populated restaurant and bar. Nobody was there to greet us and there was no bartender or servers in sight. We stood there for a bit wondering if we should just seat ourselves and, after a couple of minutes, we did. No biggie.  When our server came around, she was, apparently, having a horrible day. I'll restrain myself from using her name, but was was visibly irritated and curt from the get-go. As we watched other waitstaff greet and service tables, we took note of how friendly and polite they were to their customers and wished we had picked a different section.  We placed our drink orders and two appetizer orders: the pretzels with cheese and the bruschetta plate. The cocktails were excellent and the food would have been OK if it weren't so cold. The pretzels were room temperature at best, and the cheese had begun to harden - it came with a film/skin over the top and it wasn't warm or gooey at all - more like a paste or a spread at that point. The bruschetta was also cold with certain ingredients beginning to show signs of age and congealing. Disappointing. I have a feeling it was prepared and sitting long before our waitress was willing to bring it out to us. We decided to skip ordering anything else and asked for our check which she dropped off quickly at our table without saying a word. To her credit, she did thank us for coming in at the very end when she returned the check for our signature. We countered her disinterested service and cold food with a large tip hoping to turn her day around (and score us some karma points).  The restaurant and patio are all clean and well kept with beautiful views of the golf course and ample seating suitable for large parties or cozy tables suitable for a couple. Cocktails are great, menu is intriguing. Sadly, I don't see us returning."}
{"text":"A great local place in a local neighborhood with some excellent deals on drinks and food. Really like the bottle of wine and brusheta on Wednesday for $20. They have great wings with a rub. The cheese bath is excellent too."}
{"text":"I am disappointed that I have to give the Vue such a bad review as other times here have been good.   Arrived with friends and could see several open tables in the bar area. We're told had to wait 20 minutes for seating but could walk up to the bar and have a drink.  Which we did and stood by the receptionist and drank our cocktails.  Finally was seated. Amber our waitress was very nice.  I ordered the egg sandwich with chips and fruit.   After noticing I had not received the fruit I asked Amber if possibly she had forgot it.  She returned with a quarter cut of orange on a dinner plate,  that looked like someone had taken a bite out of it,  I seriously thought she was playing a joke, and found out she wasn't. I was so taken back as she could tell and asked if I would like to speak to the manager.  Sure I said.  He appeared with a big ego and in no way apologized for the presentation and said that is what you get for fruit on a Sunday lunch.  Continued to make comments that neither showed respect or management skills.  Amber returned with a small bowl of sliced orange wedge, two strawberries and a couple sliced apples.  I thanked her in front of him and said this is what I was expecting. If not take fruit off the menu. Manager was rude and a jerk. Didn't care to even know his name as I won't be back and will suggest anyone else should go elsewhere.    Such a big disappointment.   BUT the \"view\" was beautiful."}
{"text":"We had no idea this place was even here until we were given a combined gift card to The Hub/The Vue. We'd been to the Hub so decided to try this place. I honestly thought it was just a golf course snack shack...boy was I completely wrong. Full gourmet menu with rotating items, curated wine selection (apparently) and professional staff. If you're familiar with Postino in downtown Gilbert, it's similar to that...great bruschetta, smaller (but not necessarily worse) wine selection, but with a better, more robust menu too.  We were greeted and seated when we walked in. It has kind of a 19th hole meets wine bar atmosphere, but certainly upscale enough to be a regular eatery even if you never play golf. Upon being seated, someone other than our hostess (the owner?) came out to greet us and offer us a little first visit sample appetizer (toast with some herb butter). Nothing huge, but a nice gesture. And whatever that butter was for the toast was pretty amazing.  For our meal, we tried the chicken street tacos, bruschetta, and beef stroganoff, all of which were outstanding. Similar to Postino, they offer maybe 8-10 different types of bruschetta and you get to pick up to 4 for your entree. We were talked into a lemon/banana pudding parfait for desert that was the special and it was the perfect palette refresher to end our meal.  Our little date night there was really beyond our expectations...the chef is an obvious foodie and loves what he does and the food shows it. We absolutely loved every minute and can't wait to return...maybe for their Sunday Brunch (which apparently is a whole separate menu)."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast after a nice motorcycle ride. The service was terrible. We sat in the bar and our server was borderline hostile about helping us. Hungover, annoyed at being there, whatever, who knows but dang man, call off and save the rest of us.   Bloody Mary's were plain, served only with an olive. No lime, salt on rim, etc. I get it, you're in a hurry and but it is Sunday morning. We come out for good Bloody Mary's.   The food was a let down. Two omelets, mine was made wrong and had to be re-made. Boyfriend's was \"not terrible\" in his words and he was starving so he ate it.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  Wonderful atmosphere looking out over a pond and golf course.  Relaxing to be served such good food by accomplished servers."}
{"text":"Breakfast on Sunday was amazing.  We had the hangover and breakfast burrito.  Both were very good and prices were reasonable.  The setting is perfect in the morning overlooking the golf course.  Definitely coming back for Sunday brunches!"}
{"text":"Good bar & grill type food. Nothing that particularly stuck out, but if I lived in the neighborhood, I could see how it would become a go-to. I had a vegetable soup that was yummy and tasted home made. The bruschetta was B-. you don't have to melt brie! our server was very nice, though. It is a bit of a drive for the quality, but I wouldn't not recommend it!"}
