{"text":"What can I say about this place other than it's the best roasted chicken I've had in my life.  Yes my life!  Not only is it juicy, tender and flavourful, the skin is nice and slightly crispy as well.  The sides they come with are also amazing from the fries you can upgrade to a poutine, the coleslaw, the gravy and yes even the bread bun.  The food is so good my mouth is watering writing this review.

The other menu options are also great.  They have hot chicken sandwiches with green peas, chicken fingers, chicken poutines and chicken with more chicken!  They also have weekly specials with free pop and other delicious items.  Make sure to ask about their loyalty stamp card as well to earn free succulent chicken meals!  Love this place and to top it off it's super cheap and makes Swiss Chalet taste like you're eating wet socks with a side of rubber boots."}
{"text":"A fast food over the counter equivalent of a Saint-Hubert. 
They have the exact same model of chicken meals (cole slaw, bread, chicken, gravy sauce on the side, fries). 

I didn't like it. The other place where I used to work had a St-Hubert express which is the same thing as this place except the chicken was better.

I got the nugget meal and the nuggets were just frozen ones reheated, the fries were stale, the sauce was just really bad (goopy and did not taste like gravy), and the bread was cold.

The only reason it's not a 1 star is because the people working here are very friendly and because I haven't tried their rotisserie chicken yet so it could be really good."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch during a conference as the menu seemed straightforward and the line was fairly short. There was some confusion between employees about whether an advertised special on the chalkboard was available; the employee taking my order said yes, the one at the cash register said no, and they had to take extra time to key the order into the cash register properly.

Food took a while but was hot and obviously freshly made. Fries were crispy and not too salty, but the chicken tasted under-seasoned."}
{"text":"Usually go there at lunch time during the week. Their chicken is good given what you pay and is consistent. Their service is quick and you don't wait long to receive your food which is ideal when you want to take a quick lunch break from work. Also delivers"}
{"text":"Je travaillais de 16h00 a minuit et j'avais 30 minutes de lunch a 19h30. J'ai 3 choix viable étant au coin de Rene-Levesque et University. Mcdo a la Gare centrale, Tim Horton et POULET FUSÉE! Poulet Fusée est un des rares endroit ouvert après 19h30 la semaine dans les restos du Halle de la Gare qui offrent un Choix du Chef a 5$. Écoutez, c'est pas WOW! C'est des frites congelé, de la sauce au poulet en poudre, puis la seule chose très bonne c'est le poulet. Bon, pas cher, belle heures d'ouverture, livraison offert. C'est ben correct mais pas WOW!"}

Veille du 40e anniversaire de naissance ! Un bon dîner en vue. L'un des meilleurs poulets du centre-ville, avec une exquise sauce BBQ tomatée et bien assaisonnée. Un poulet parfaitement grillé avec de bonnes frites et un bon petit pain qui ressemble vraiment à un petit pain ! Je suis un habitué du coin pour satisfaire mes fringales. Fatigué du poulet chaud Métro, ordinaire.

Poulet Fusée, vous y serez au 7e ciel !

Eve of my 40e anniversary ! A good lunch, fast and filing enough. One of the best chicken in town, with an exquisite BBQ sauce, \"tomato-ee\" and well seasoned. A perfectly grilled chicken with nice and smooth (inside), crunchy (outside) french fries sidedished by a real small bread that looks like a real small bread ! I'm used to get something there simply to satisfy my apetite for a roasted chicken. I'm tired of warm Métro chicken, really ordinary.

With \"Rocket Chicken\"  you will be on 7th heaven !"}
