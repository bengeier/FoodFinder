{"text":"Figaro's Ristorante is a small Italian restaurant in the centre of Pickering. We managed to get a table by just getting there early, but on subsequent evenings as we wandered past it was full at the same time, so its best to book, as this was in winter! The restaurant itself has a stylish modern feel, with modern furniture, black and white photos adorning the walls, and a small corner bar area. The staff were enthusiastic and friendly, nothing being too much trouble.    Menu wise there was a massive selection including a long list of antipasto, and extensive variety of main meals including pasta favourites like carbonara and arrabiata, scattered amongst unusual dishes. There was also a wide variety of pizza, traditional and Calzone, and well as main meals like steaks, salmon and other seafood dishes. My wife went for the sea bass, which was both generously portioned and very flavoursome. I went for the Pizza Carnivaro (for carnivores), there was also one for vegetarians too! The combination of chorizo, salami, chicken etc, was a winner, as was the side salad I ordered in a vain hope to be healthy, which was enormous, enough to feed three! Drinks wise there was a large wine selection, as well as a good variety of soft drinks and bottled beers - the Peroni was a little expensive though.    Only two minor negatives, we ordered a Cappuccino, but the machine had broken down, nothing to worry about really. The second was the vacuous and loud conversation a neighbouring table were having, some people have no volume control. I initially thought of subtracting a star for this, but that would be churlish, this was a great meal, which deserves a solid four stars."}
{"text":"I booked a table for two for eight o'clock. We arrived about ten minutes  before and were shown to our table. Service was pleasant and friendly  and we began with a bottle of Nero d'Avola which was good. For starters  we had the Olives and bread which consisted of four olives and two  slices of bread. My partner had A goats cheese and tomato salad which  was very stingy on the cheese. I had a mozzerella and tomato salad with  basil on it. However the basil finely chopped and appeared to have been  chucked on, as opposed to torn in to nice chunky bits, and there was no  olive oil as per a classic Caprese salad. Also to share we had what was  advertised as Sardinian flat bread or carta musica. I have eaten this in  Sardinia and what we were served was simply not it. It was a basic  garlic bread with rosemary on. Don't get me wrong it was very nice but  to call it Sardinan flat bread is misleading to say the least. For  mains we both had the ten ounce fillet steaks which arrived looking very  lost on the big plates they came with. My partner had the gorgonzola  sauce and I had a green peppercorn sauce. They were served seperately in  a bowl on the plate. They both looked the same, like custard. On  tasting it became obvious that they have used the same sauce base and  just added a bit of cheese to hers and some peppercorns to mine. I did  complain that the sauce was terrible but it did not appear to get back  to the kitchen. The steaks, although small, were well cooked and tasty.  With it came saute potatoes and a few veg of green beans, carrots and  baby sweetcorn. These were ok. For desserts we had the Tiramisu. When  they came it was soon obvious that they had been made for ages and had  been sat in a fridge. I could not taste any coffee in it. Not good at  all. With Limoncello, grappa and wine the bill was £86 after I had got  them to knock off £2.50 for charging me for two portions of olives.   Single shared toilet at the back is unfortunate as people often queuing outside. I  certainly would not rush to get back here but the service and amosphere  was good.Let down by some shoddy food and practices. Ok if you're  passing through"}
{"text":"Lovely Italian Resturant in pickering and worth a visit if your in the area. I had the calamari and prawn starter, a carnivoro pizza for my main. There were 5 of us in our group and everyone enjoyed their meal. It was all washed down by a lovely bottle of wine. The waiter was the only problem....didn't offer to pour the wine, forgot to bring out a portion of chips that were ordered and he could have alerted us to the fact that the garlic bread starter was actually a full size garlic pizza which my 9 yr old son had ordered for his starter and was therefore unable to eat his main course pizza. All in all a good reasonably priced meal and if in the area agin I would go back."}
