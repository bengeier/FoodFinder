{"text":"I live within walking distance of Park Rd Shopping Ctr... and love the shops and restaurant options.  I want to enjoy Charlotte Cafe but seem to always catch it on an \"off\" day.  I'm now thinking it's just normal procedure for them. In general it's over-priced for what you get.  I was in with my folks this past Friday for a 9:30am breakfast.  The service was painfully slow.  She told us immediately upon seating they hadn't planned to be \"busy today\".  Really... on black Friday... at Park Rd Shopping Ctr.?? You didn't expect to be busy??  To be honest I don't blame her.  I think it's just poor management and she was left to deal with the consequences as were the rest of us patrons. When our breakfast finally arrived it wasn't room temperature.  It was cold.  Nothing says good morning like cold eggs. grits, and bacon.    And to top it off... when my dad when to pay the bill it took him 10 minutes and 3 three employees to ring him up.  He was the only person in line at the time and they had no idea what to do.  Quite honestly... I do not understand how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Ate a late breakfast here with my father today. First time trying this diner out. Amazing food, amazing service, portion and price are spot on. 

I will be back for more and would highly recommend for a breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Average at best.

Have been wanting to try for some time, stopped in a little after 2:00 pm for lunch.  Dining room was clean with 4 tables of customers eating.  Greeting from the wait staff was cold.  Waited over 20 mins for the cheeseburger and Mac and cheese that I ordered.  Mac and cheese was bland, with very little cheese flavor.  Cheeseburger was surprisingly small in size, only slightly larger than a McDonald's or Burger King burger.  Appeared to be a frozen patty and no real flavor."}
{"text":"Does not merit ANY stars!!! Worst cafe my family and I have ever eaten at!!! Terrible service and food!!! Save your time and money and go somewhere else!!!!!! Should have stayed closed after the fire.  It was a horrible experience!!!!! A disgrace to Park Road Shopping Center!!"}
{"text":"Made a mistake and came at the end of breakfast shift - 11am.  Although the staff is courteous i still waited 8 minutes once seated before a waitress came to my table.  

The pricey omelet was hard and tight. The hash browns were cold and my bisquit was overcooked.

Sorry, i'll stick with John's Kitchen even if it is a drive from Park Road area!"}
{"text":"I had a creepy feeling when I walked into this restaurant but decided to stay nonetheless. The restaurant is deep rather than wide, hence the weird layout and creepy, damp feeling my co worker and I got. When we sat down, the server was nice but we kind of felt rushed. I don't know why, It was 3pm there was no crowd. Anyway, I ordered the Daily Special of Southern Fried Chicken w/collards and fried okra and he ordered the Grilled chicken Breast w/ stewed squash and collards. Simple choices right?

It took about 10 minutes for the food to come out, I was indirectly chastised for ordering a breast and leg (it's either dark or white in that establishment) which kind of put me off. I started with the fried okra, it tasted like every frozen bag of fried okra from Bi-Lo. Then on to the collards, someone must be salt happy because there was enough salt for a Morton's factory. My co worker's stewed squash was crunchy... why is stewed squash crunchy? He didn't eat enough to find out and we didn't finish our food. I probably should have gone with my creepy feeling and walked out. Always trust your first mind!"}
{"text":"I think that if it we less expensive this would be a just fine low-cost charlotte diner. But alas a tuna melt costs almost ten bucks and is mediocre. It seems a diner cannot be both over priced and plain. Charlotte cafe is both. Why go here when there are much better alteratives that taste better and cost less? I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place had horrible service. Waited over a hour for my food and it came out cold. Never even got my check to leave....if there was a negative star option this place would have it."}
{"text":"Ate there Saturday brunch about 11am. Food was tasty, service was speedy, accurate and friendly.  I had a sausage egg sandwich with decaf coffee. Others had omlettes and just plain eggs. 
Decor is a little dated, but what I've come to expect from a well established eatery that focuses on the food.  Place was clean enough.
It was crowded but not overly noisy.
Definite do-over."}
{"text":"I went today in the middle of lunch. Half of the food for my table came out cold...some of the meal was meat.  My side salad was forgotten to be served, and the flavor of the lettuce tasted like a chemical or stale cigarette ash. The server we had was very nice, and clearly frustrated. Many servers said that they were experiencing the same problem all day. I spoke with the owner, and he acted like nothing was wrong, and that none of the \"200 other people\" served that day had the same problem. Luckily, our meal was compensated. Definitely different after the fire. I also got sick from the undercooked food. I was relieved reading the previous commentator had a similar experience on the same day."}
{"text":"One star for the wait staff. Ate lunch there on a Thursday; had a blt sandwich and cream of broccoli soup. The soup tasted funny so they replaced with chicken soup which tasted a lot like Campbell's soup. The coffee wasn't the best either. That night I felt sick and I spent the whole weekend throwing up and unable to eat anything else. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"One if my favorite local spots - great food, great service, at a great price. I had the homemade fried chicken, Mac and cheese, and corn. All were delicious!"}
{"text":"A casual retro restaurant with great breakfasts, lunches, and dinners.  I was passing through Charlotte on a Sunday morning and chanced upon the Charlotte Cafe.  Anna was our server and did a great job and was  very friendly. Eggs were cooked to order,  bacon nice and crispy,  and hash browns were not seasoned so I could add the amount of salt I desired. Coffee not great but food and service were very good. Oldies music added to the retro ambiance.  Try the Cafe and enjoy it"}
{"text":"Hidden gem - frozen in time - in the crack of Park Road Shopping Center. This place has been around for more than 20 years. It's Charlotte's version of a 'meat and three' with dozens of kinds of vegetables offered. The service is old school and friendly, the sort of place where after you go a few times everyone will know your name."}
{"text":"Charlotte Cafe is an old school type of place which I happen to love but truth be told, the joint could use a good cleaning. There is this thin layer of grime that seems to be over the tables and especially the menus. ICK! 

That day, I had the Chicken Pita sandwich with a side of Fried Squash. The sandwich was good no complaints and the squash was fine as well. The squash was obviously frozen not fresh but still it was OK. 

The service was PUSHY! Our waitress was irritated with me for not knowing what I wanted the moment my butt hit the booth. She became even more annoyed when after the 2nd time, I still did not know what I wanted. 

I doubt I will go back. There are a TON (almost too many) of these meat and three places here in the QC that offer tastier food."}
{"text":"It has become recreational bloodsport for fake cuisine affecianados to write critical massacres of local eateries that have been in town longer than they have been alive. Item for item they slay with disregard for the humble people working there and they're efforts to do the best they can. I bet you wouldn't share your thoughts with the management as you were paying the check. There are a lot of people including me that like this place, take your faux attitude and juvenile critiques down the street."}
{"text":"Reopened today after being closed due to a fire last year!  Completely remodeled and a brand new menu.

It's much larger inside now.  The booth seating is very comfortable.  And it's a no-frills, less expensive place to grab a bite compared to all the fancy restaurants that have recently opened in Park Road Shopping Center.

I liked the hot Italian sub and the fried zucchini.  The gyro sandwich looks good too so I will try it next time!"}
{"text":"We come for  southern comfort the grilled cheese and bowl of chilli is an awesome dinner. The veggies are great and the service is always good. I have never been here and not walked away empty."}
{"text":"I don't know where all these bad reviews come in, but my experience was the opposite. Fried chicken was delicious and their mac and cheese and candied yams like yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Charlotte Cafe had become a favorite of mine for both breakfast and lunch. The breakfast specials are always very filling and fit the budget. I must say that the servers at The Charlotte Cafe all are very nice and display superb hospitality. I am never apprehensive about who the server will be. When I have guest in town, I am going to make sure we make at least one visit to the Charlotte Cafe. The menu has an overwhelming variety of choices that whether you want a nice sandwich meal, comfort food, or something light The Charlotte Cafe will never disappoint."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love places like this.  Unsuspecting family owned diner that's been around forever and has a lot of regulars.  Hell, they even have livermush on the menu and, for me, that's an extra gold star!   (If you live in Charlotte and don't know what livermush is you must be a transplant).  We were seated right away but waited at least five minutes for our server to arrive.   I can forgive that.  I ordered the western omelette with grits and a biscuit and my husband had a Philly cheesesteak sub with fries.  Food was good... no complaints there.  The biscuits are homemade and the coffee was decent.  My complaints are primarily service oriented.  We had never been here before but it is obvious that there are a lot of regulars and they are catered to, as they should be,  but you can't neglect new patrons as a result!   I felt left out and our service suffered.   We sat with empty coffees and teas on the edge of the table for about 10-15 minutes while servers walked by our booth at least 20 times.  A middle aged woman (owner or manager) chatted up the guests sitting behind us (regulars I assume) the entire time we were waiting for our server to return with refills.  We were directly across from the tea and coffee machine.  We were close enough that she could have gotten us refills without even having to pause her convo with the table behind us.  Frustrating.  When our food came,  we waited another 7 minutes for our server to \"find\" ketchup for my husband's fries (there were multiple bottles under the drink station directly across the aisle from our booth in plain view.)  I told our server that it was our first time and she almost seemed embarrassed of the first impression.  She mentioned that Sundays at diners get crazy but it was 1:30 in the afternoon and the place was not packed.  (They serve breakfast til 2.)  She couldn't have had more than 2 tables.  The place is tiny and there were two other servers there.  Either way... we paid about $25 for our tab which seemed reasonable.  Also worth mentioning... as we were paying at the front I noticed the sanitation score was 84.  Yikes.  I work in a restaurant and 84 is unheard of.  Will I come back?  Maybe for a hangover breakfast... but I might still need to be a little drunk when I get there."}
{"text":"The clink and clatter is back.  So are the old faithful who consider the Charlotte Café part of their culinary ritual.  Admittedly, they are ironing out some wrinkles, but they are up and running.  

So, what to expect?  All your southern diner plates with daily specials, friendly staff, reasonable prices, inviting decor, & bottomless coffee.  Their crowd is less interested in all the fancy, new restaurants popping up around them.  Rather, this is the old guard that wants a good meal at fair prices.  They wave to one another and chat away while Linda refills their cup of Joe.  Life is good, again.  Much success with your re-opening!"}
{"text":"Love this good old diner-type place for breakfast. In fact, my husband and I go there ALMOST every Saturday. Good special deal of eggs, bacon, grits, toast and the coffee is included."}
{"text":"Second visit (last was over 3 years ago) - same lousy service for overpriced, cold food.  

Clearly - the older, \"regulars\" are attended to - others ignored.  Three servers - one gal watched TV, our server went missing and the dude (Owner) ignored my plea for a drink refill.  Had they been busy - that may have been an excuse - but this was at 6:30pm on a weeknight - the place was not even half full!

Thanks for eliminating this joint from future consideration."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years for good ole home cooking.  The food is good and the staff friendly. Unfortunately the prices are out of hand. I had a western omelet, side of bacon and a coffee for $18.75 before tip!  At that price it needs to be over the top not just typical diner food."}
{"text":"A decent option for breakfast or lunch while visiting the shops in Park Road shopping center. Actually this was our second choice....first was Flying Biscuit Cafe but on a Sunday morning, the line is out the door. Didn't feel like waiting an hour so we skipped down to the Charlotte Cafe. While not as good as Flying Biscuit, we DID have a very nice breakfast, good quality and service for a reasonable price. And, we got in and out relatively quickly.


Recommend you save your dessert for Va Da Vie Gelato in the middle of the Center....this is NOT an indictment of Charlotte Cafe's desserts mind you, it's just that Va Da Vie's Gelato is SOOOOOOOOOO good. Keep that in mind."}
{"text":"The interior of this place was kind of a turn off when we first walked it.  Everything is very dated and just seems a little grimy.  I was willing to look past it if the food was good .... which it wasn't.

I ordered the chicken pita which wasn't great.  The chicken had tons of fatty pieces and the sour cream cucumber sauce was really heavy.  The fries were okay, but I'm pretty sure they were just frozen fries.  I am glad I went for the fries though after seeing the potato salad.  My mom got a tuna melt which she wasn't a huge fan of and came with about 3 cans of tuna on one sandwich.  My grandmother got the rueben (she strayed from her usual BLT since she said it wasn't good) and didn't particularly care for the sauce.

The waitress was great and kept our ice tea glasses full.  Really the only reason for the 2 star review!

One other complaint ... I was on the side of the booth facing the TV which I don't have an issue with.  The issue what that the show playing on the history channel was showing the dissection of a worm.  In case we weren't clear with what was going on, the closed captioning was on to inform us that the intestine was being pull out of the worm.  NOT what I want to watch while I'm eating."}
{"text":"If you are on the fence about going here just check out their most recent inspection and I'm sure you will make up your mind real quick. \"Rotted/molded potatoes stored in plastic container near cooler with maggots\" was enough for me."}
{"text":"The young, dark-haired, sort of dark-skinned girl who works afternoons at The Arboretum is cold as ice, NEVER smiles, ignores new customers and overall acts like she would rather be anywhere than there. I have eaten here many times mid-afternoon  and it is always the same with her. She honestly needs to find work that is not in the \"people business.\"  Her name is Stephanie."}
{"text":"Charming Cafe!!!  At first I felt under dressed!  This place is very nice looking!  This is one of those places that I did not read the reviews before I dined here!  My reason for checking this place out was I was looking for somewhere great to eat and review (I'm only looking for somewhere great to eat and review EVER!  {Which means I want to like the place!})!

The Service was friendly and accurate.  I'm comfortable in the back dinning room when it is busy and in the front when it is not busy!

Monday Night 12-12- 2011 was my First Dine here.  I ordered Spaghetti with Meat Sauce and a side of Turnip Greens instead of Salad and I did not have to ask.  My Waitress automatically suggested if I would like to substitute my Salad for one of the sides, I could!  The most important part of eating is that the food is good!  I LOVE being impressed by how beautiful or cool a place looks and how friendly the staff is, though really service and decor are nice, I do not expect much anywhere as long as the food is on the greater end of good or better, GREAT!  This is where I'm going to talk about the FOOD!  The Pasta was perfect (for a non-fresh, you know out of a box) not cooked too long and not soaked too long (like many places) and I have had fresh pasta that was not as good as this though fresh is usually better, fresh pasta is not what I'm expecting here!  That is why I say the Pasta was perfect it tasted fine and was not waterlogged!  The Sauce was FANTASTIC.  Fresh with GREAT flavor. Thick, NOT watery!  Plenty of finely ground meat, finely chopped Onion and Garlic that I could see (not powder)!

12-14-2011 Wednesday is \"Italian Night\" My Second Dinner was similar: Spaghetti and Meat Sauce with sides of Fried Zucchini and Macaroni and Cheese (the baked kind made with Eggs).  The Pasta was still perfect and the Meat Sauce was very similar with a great though slight variation from two days prior!  They sat me at the same table as Monday and they seem used to me taking photos now!

12-21-2011 was my third Dine!  They are consistently Very Good!  Food and Service - So Far I have eaten the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce all three times and the Turnip Greens twice!

Before finishing this review I wanted to eat here three times and watch the movie:  \"As Good As It Gets\" with Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt.  Of course anyone who has dinned with me can understand I like this movie because I identify with the character played by Nicholson and why I do not recommend any of my friends see: \"There Will Be Blood\" ..... I can't deny it!  So I told a small group of my friends and they agreed that I'm a lot like Jacks Character in \"As Good As It Gets\".  Glad none of them mentioned the Daniel Day Lewis Character from: \"There Will Be Blood\"!  I'm glad for that too!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.  Always have a great server, food is amazing.  Everyone is so nice.  They give free veggies to kids under 2.  There is always something to please any hungry person - a diverse menu!"}
{"text":"Who the hell goes to a typical southern diner for vegetarian food or a California wrap!? 

Great classic Charlotte meat and three place. A little pricey but so is the real estate. 

Love my old school Charlotte stuff and happy to see new people don't so maybe it will stay old school."}
{"text":"I can't understand what anyone (under the age of 75) enjoys about this place. 

Without being rude, here is my best assessment of the food... Cafeteria food gone really bad. Price isn't bad, but the food IS. Service is ok, but the food...Well, I think you get the point. 

It is a prime location, so I implore, beg, plead with Edens Development Group to put something worth while in Charlotte Café's place."}
{"text":"Well I'm not vegetarian, as can be noted by my patented American Gut. With that said, order a hot dog they are hard to screw up. This place is way overpriced for the crud they serve up. You might find a bunch of soccer moms taking their loud kids there. I hate kids.. so.. maybe this has jaded my review. Que Sera"}
{"text":"I love finding cozy restaurants that aren't huge conglomerates .  This is a nice cute diner where the regular customers drop in often. I ordered the vegetable plate which was amazing the cabbage and Lima beans were good but my favorite was the fried zucchini sticks they were so good I ordered an extra side of them. Also are waitress was sweet and attentive and on top of all that the decor is retro cool give this place a try it's nothing fancy just good home style cooking !"}
{"text":"Really bad. I ordered shrimp and it came with an obvious huge long black hair all over the top. I pointed it to the waitress and she carried the shrimp in her hand back to kitchen. Okra over fried and tasteless, BF ordered BBQ and was a little bit & mediocre if that. Coke came in a can so refills are charged. They charged us for shrimp and lunch for 2 was $38. We are easy to please and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Simple brunch breakfast. No line or wait to be seated even at peak brunch hours. Amazing biscuits!"}
{"text":"If you are a sophisticated snob eater, this place is not for you. If your looking for good decent diner food then come on in. 
I like this place and the clientele is older and calm, clean & bathrooms redone since fire which to me is a Hugh step up."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast last Saturday - what a great spot!  It is a typical cafe/diner feel - lots of tables and the waitstaff moving at the speed of light.

I had the breakfast sandwich with home fries.  Super delish and came out hot.  It was more food than i could finish at a great price ($6 bucks!!)  Breakfast on Saturdays is served until 2pm.  Pay up front - love it!  Will definitely be back!  :-D"}
{"text":"Small place with a nice local feel with lots of regulars. Amazing list vegetable side dishes: fries okra was good, spinach was passable, not sure if any are fresh.

Strange thing was $2.15 for one can of Coke. I guess they need to make a profit somehow. Next time I'll look at the price for iced tea and try that."}
{"text":"The Charlotte Cafe is a well respected restaurant in our city and has a lot of loyal patrons.  This restaurant is particularly liked by the senior crowd, for whatever reason.  Service is spot on.  Menu offerings are varied.  They have daily specials and today it took all that I had to not get their chicken and dumplings that were on special.  Instead, I had grilled chicken with sides of baked apples and spinach.  Unfortunately, I found the quality of the food to be lacking.  My chicken breast was flat and void of taste. I tried to pepper it up with Tobasco.  The spinach was mushy.  The baked apples appealed to my sweet tooth.  Overall, the meal was disappointing.  There is a certain charm to the restaurant, but without food that wakes up my taste buds, I will leave the charm for others to enjoy.  I was part of a large group that lunched there today and I will say that the one server taking care of our table did a good job of servicing our table.  On a side note, the sanitary score is 90.5, and left me wondering if the management is on top of its game.  I hate the expression \"it is what it is\", but in this case, it is what it is."}
{"text":"Went to this little diner in a strip mall for breakfast.  Honestly, the price was a bit high for the quality.  I ordered the eggs benedict.   Apparently the cook didn't realize or didn't care that eggs benedict isn't a hard boiled egg on top of canadian bacon and an english muffin covered in hollandaise sauce.  

Much better places to eat nearby.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"No good! Unless you are grandpa or grandma with a low sodium diet this restaurant is not for you! Very dated! 

Walked and sat immediately which was nice. However no fountain drink option really stinks especially if this place is a staple. 

Ordered drinks and had the broccoli soul, pretty much tasted like cream gravy with white broccoli chunks thrown in.

Next our main courses came. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, grilled with cheese, what I ended up getting was cold chicken salad on toasted white plain bread, and no cheese. Not to mention the chicken salad had dark meat (gross) and eggs in it! Yuck! I do not normally send items back I did this time. 


Other guest ordered tuna melt and got a chicken salad melt. 

Save your money and time and don't go."}
{"text":"I like this throwback kind of place.  I went for a lunch time meal the other day and was very happy to see that they were still serving lunch.  By the way, they were packed which is telling to me that people really enjoy the food here.  Always a good sign.

The omelet I had was delicious and the sides of bacon and ham were cooked perfectly.  The waitress was super friendly and very attentive.  The decor is nothing to write home about but you don't come here for the atmosphere, just the food.

Parking is a little tough as is with anything in Park Road Shopping Center.  Be patient."}
{"text":"Imagine an old diner. GrOwing up in the north east that's the closest comparison I have! 
So  just give it a shot! You'll have a good meal! (Just not gourmet or healthy)
Don't have high expectations. This place is simple but good. Nothing fancy, plate presentation is as simple as it comes. decor is dated. 
Only good service comes from Dan and Anna. They are great!!!!!  Like really great. So sweet and extremely attentive  This is an old charlotte spot so it's Not trendy and not updated. Mostly white haired guests tucked in the booths talking too loud with heavy accents complaining about something. 
I come about twice a week. I love their veggie plate. They have the Biggest selection in charlotte. If you are feeling like a fatty order the cheese sticks, they are really good they have a big menu, so options for everyone. 
Also they are always Great for breakfast on the weekend. There's Never a wait."}
{"text":"Just your basic diner with good food and great service. Daily specials and a discount if you pay cash. The portions are nice sized and the menu is vast. Lots
Of nice Greek dishes and many choices for sides as well. They must be doing something right because they've been here a while."}
{"text":"My small group dined at Charlotte Cafe on a Friday at noon. This is your meat and two place with the normal grilled and fried items and sandwiches. I cannot say there was much about this restaurant that will inspire me to return. The food was OK, the service was inattentive. We had to go and look for the waiter twice for refills. There are many good restaurants in the Park Road Shopping Center area that provide competition for this cafe."}
{"text":"Since they reopened. The Charlotte Cafe is better than ever. 
We dropping in for a late lunch. Were treated like royalty."}
{"text":"The Charlotte Café is the definition of A-OK. I attend a monthly event that is held here and they get major props for a quiet side room that we fill with 15-20 people each time. The waitress assigned to our room always does a fantastic job keeping track of everything and providing us all with separate checks (a nightmare, I am sure).

The food I have tried has been a little hit or miss. I did not love the chicken and dumplings (though others in my group did) and I was actually quite fond of the hamburger steak. True story, I once made my boyfriend Salisbury steak for dinner and he was really excited until he cut into it and realized it was hamburger not a traditional steak. Hamburger steak has now been banned in my household so it was nice to find it at a reasonable price outside the home. 

Since I go once a month I have decided to keep track of the sides I have tried both for the benefit of the Yelp community and to aid my own failing memory. 

Baked Mac & Cheese - Yes! But I am a huge fan of mac & cheese in general.
Mashed Potatoes & Gravy - A-OK, came with plenty of gravy but lacked a wow factor.
Spinach - No
Gollard Greens - No, they were too bitter when I tried them.
Steamed Cabbage - Yes! There's a natural built in limit to the excitement over steamed cabbage, but I liked it.
Black Eyed Peas - Meh I would have liked a little more seasoning on them. However it was a large portion! 
Okra and tomatoes - rather tasty even though I am not huge on okra.
Navy beans - delicious but undercooked.
Stewed squash - pretty delicious stewed with onion. 
Tossed salad - simple chopped lettuce and tomatoes on top. The ranch served with it was beautifully creamy. 
Turnip Greens - not a fan, pretty salty.
Green Beans - I liked these! Stewed with onion. 
Boiled New Potatoes - they were okay but you only get 2
Applesauce - exactly what you get from the store.

Stay tuned for monthly additions as I try them!"}
{"text":"Very very over priced. And yeah only went because the flying biscuit had a long wait. $12 for 2 eggs, bacon, and grits"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago/San Diego my husband and I are in for a shock here in the Carolinas, this was our first dining experience. I don't know how we ended up here with the plastic coated checkered table cloths and lack of ambience, but we stayed and ate. 

I was looking on the menut for the typical California wrap donned with bean sprouts and avocados; instead I found southern fried chicken, skillet fried chicken, veggie lasagna, meatloaf, coleslaw, fried okra, collard greens... and of course BBQ. 
My question to you is WHAT ON EARTH IS BBQ? Is it a sauce? Pork? Beef? Chicken? No clue... 
Anyways we ordered from their extensive menu ( the variety of \"veggies\" is outrageous, but mostly fried). 

***Note to North Carolina: Food does taste good without having to be breaded and dropped in piping hot fatty lard. 

The food ended up being good and large portions and the waitress was \"sweet as piiiie\" with her \"yes maam's\" and polite service. 
Overall, I am hoping to find a restaurant with more of a variety than sandwiches, southern home cooking and the most unhealthy vegetables I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is really good. The scrambled eggs were especially yummy. The ladies working there are really friendly and nice, but the service is really slow. If you eat here be sure you have gobs of time because you will wait. Now to be clear, I don't mean the place was packed and it took a while. This place was like the Tardis, it was bigger on the inside. When we got there, there was a plethora of seating, so I couldn't really tell what was keeping our waitress. At least they have a pretty loose ticket policy, and we didn't wait for the check, instead the hostess asked where we were sitting and we told her what we had."}
{"text":"This is exactly what you'd expect from a no frills local diner - simple menu, sweet as pie staff, etc. Usually, a favorite go to place for the family. But $50 for breakfast for two adults and a toddler? No alcohol, no coffee, etc. Just the basics. 

No thanks.

They've raised their prices to keep pace with the change in rent, I get that,  but they'd be better off taking a little loss on the food for awhile and making up for it by serving more people in the long run."}
{"text":"Took an hour to get breakfast, guy who came in after us ordered, ate and left before we got our order, service was horrible and I wouldn't feed this food to a dog! Oh, and me and my kids overheard the owner cursing the waitress. Classy!"}
{"text":"You would've thought that this place would've gotten better since the fire..um no, it's exactly the same. The chicken in my gyro was cooked waaay too long to the point of rubbery, their tatziki was watery and the green beans were mushy. Needless to say I didn't eat it and they were nice enough to take it off my bill. I will never go back. I would rather eat at K&W than this place. Their health inspections, looking back on them, are scary as well. I just don't feel comfortable eating there."}
{"text":"When I walked in the placed seem more like a country diner than a cafe, which there is nothing wrong with but it seemed a bit out of place there on park road. The service was good and my server did what was expected even after she was chewed out by an older, grumpier patron. She handled the situation well which says a lot because this guy was rude and you could tell that he just wanted to complain about something. I ordered a greek salad with olive oil as dressing and my server bought out a light colored oil which I found out was soybean oil. The lady at the front informed me that they do not have olive oil and I found that odd. After finding that out I didn't even want to bother with trying their coffee."}
{"text":"I feel bad bashing what is obviously an old, well respected fixture of the Park Road shopping center. But I gotta do it. 

The decor is so great, so checkered, so old school diner. Lingering smoke, very intense. Mirrors and bored hostesses. Awesome.

For a vegetarian, this place is optionless after 11 am (an no, they won't fix you an omelette if it's 11:10 - them's the breaks) other than the veg plate and an amazingly, insanely bland egg salad sammich. So that's what we got : egg salad on white (there was no mayo, no herbs, no nothin going on here) with a pile of diner fries, good fries, and a veg plate - 3 slices of tomato, 4 banana-tasting slices of fried to liquid zucchini, three broccoli florets with a somewhat creepy \"hollandaise\" dripping into a pool at the bottom of the bowl. For 6 bucks.  

There's so much better food to be had in this area (hell, even this shopping center) for the same price or cheaper."}
{"text":"Unremarkable food. Nothing tastes like something I couldn't make at home. We ordered pancakes & scrambled eggs for the kids, hubby had eggs benedict and I had the jimmy cristo. Hmm. Just ok. Pricey for the food quality and we noticed a sanitation rating of 84 posted by the door. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I wandered into the Charlotte Cafe after doing some shopping at Park Road and wanted some late breakfast. Upon entering, I was surprised at how large this seemingly small spot actually was. It definitely has a true diner feel to it, and the menu is reflective, with a little bit of everything you could think of to eat. We both decided to have breakfast, and went for the combination platter. It included eggs, pancakes, choice of meat and potato. The food was served very quickly, and our waitress was that perfect mix of friendly and sassy. It was just what you'd expect from a diner experience. My only caveat was that the combination platter was $12, which is a little pricey in comparison to many other breakfast joints in the area. They do have weekday breakfast specials, but no such luck for the weekends."}
{"text":"My experience was similar to some of the other reveiwers. This place is slooooowwww and overpriced!  First let me say that i only went here because Flying Biscuit had a 30 min wait and I was too hungry to wait that long so I decided to check this place out since it's in the same plaza. 

We went in for breakfast/brunch on a Sunday, and was seated immediately which we thought was a good sign. We were greeted by a friendly but frantic waitress. We first ordered water and coffee. She brought us room temperature water with no ice! I didn't realize I needed to say \"ICE\" water considering it's July and it's 95 degrees outside! The coffee was ok, not great but not terrible either.

Next we ordered our food which was also eventful. I ordered the southwest scramble and my wife ordered combo one (one egg, two pancakes, bacon, and grits). The problem with ordering was that the waitress kept trying to walk away without completing the order. I had to ask if my scramble came with toast and she was like \"Oh yea, what type would u like?\" My wife asked about the option of grits, home fries, or hash browns and again the waitress asked which one she wanted. If we hadn't stopped to ask her, what the hell would she have brought us??

So now the wait begins....We wait, wait, and wait some more. Our waitress continues to apologize and continues to offer us more and more coffee. I don't want coffee! I want something to chew! Other waitresses in the restaurant also look frustrated, angry, and overworked.

After about 30-40 min we finally get out food and I was extremely disappointed with the portion size. My \"southwest scramble\" was tiny and with bland unseasoned sausage inside and my home fries consisted of 4-5 huge chunks of potatoe that weren't completely cooked through. Wife's pancakes were ok but certainly nothing special! Also, both of our meals were roughly $15 including coffee which was way overpriced for what we got in exchange.

I say all that to say this....I will never return! If you find yourself waiting in line at Flying Biscuit and feel tempted to take the short walk to this place remember this review. You've been warned!"}
{"text":"Droppped in after long flight back to Charlotte.
Wanted breakfast. Mid day Sunday. I was seated immediately and gave my order ( waffles, egg, bacon) and had tea and water dropped off fairly quick. They were very busy. After 40 minutes and no food (after several promises it was coming) I left. Too hungry and tired to wait any longer."}
{"text":"Very friendly people. We really enjoy Maria. Food  is excellent especially for breakfast. We come for the fresh biscuits. Night time specials are good and reasonably priced. Parking is plentiful. Good room available for parties or meetings."}
{"text":"I gave 4 stars because you can't give 1/2 stars (otherwise 3.5). For what it is (an old-fashioned, simple diner) it seems very average. We did take out, and the hostess was super friendly. The Jimmy's Super Chef salad was HUGE!..and very good...typical iceberg lettuce style. The Chef Salad Wrap was something new, and we all thought it was a tasty twist on a classic salad. The gyro was good for a non-Greek restaurant, and the crinkle fries were crisp and tasty. The stewed apples were perfect and not all syrupy or thick like other places (Cracker Barrel)...they just looked like some apples that were cooked, which meant they were nice and fresh. They do Groupons, so look for one to try the place out. Oh, and if you dine in, you WILL be the youngest one there...unless you are over 70!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it just me, but I don't get how people can enjoy the food here. Maybe it is based on what I order, but all three visits were breakfast, and how can you go wrong with breakfast, right? Well, Charlotte Cafe does. 
From the cold coffee to the greasy eggs, everything is wrong. 
This most recent visit, I ordered the Breakfast Special, two eggs any style, a meat, and hash browns, potatoes or grits.
I ordered scrambled eggs, sausage links and hash browns, with an English muffin, extra charge.
The eggs were runny and dripping in grease. The sausage links were split down the middle and grilled, also soaked in grease. As for the hash browns, undercooked.
Two stars is for the service and quick turnaround.
I'll stick with my other go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for an impromptu breakfast and it did not disappoint. Every staff member is attentive and friendly. The breakfast was awesome, especially the hash browns and they have brilliant combo options for the sweet and savory types (eggs + pancakes). Will definitely return. Toast was my go to...it now might be toast."}
{"text":"Everything I ate tasted great. 

I had two eggs over-easy (done very well), grits, sausage links, and a biscuit. 

I must say the sausage links are very tasty. 

The service was kind of bleh... and the restaurant seemed kind of dirty, but it did have that traditional diner kind of feel (maybe dirt is part of that feel). 

Overall a good solid breakfast but not thing out of the ordinary."}
