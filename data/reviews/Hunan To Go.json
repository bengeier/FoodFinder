{"text":"we pick up our dinner here once in a while. the dishes are good, but we substitute our fried rice for steamed rice. the only bad thing is, the wait is long during dinner time."}
{"text":"This listing states they have delivery however they only have pick up. Why is this even coming up in the search results for delivery???"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our main dishes.  Flavorful!  The fried rice is a little odd to me.  They used yellow rice or something.  Good fried rice is important to us so I don't know that we will go back."}
{"text":"Recently received a flyer in the mail with their menu. So I figured we would try it out.  I purchased the quart size portions and when the kids and I got home we were shocked on just how much food we received!  This Chinese food reminds me of the Chinese restaurants in Canada and New York. Absolutely delicious!  Wonton soup, egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken, chicken and broccoli and chicken lo mein all very good!  You will not be disappointed, try this little gem of a restaurant out especially if you like Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Portions were large. Food was hot. Prices for the lunch menu are great. Ordering through the website made pick ups very easy."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and the food is awesome! Very fast and great customer service:)"}
{"text":"The food was hot and fresh. The serving sizes were very large and came in quality microwaveable containers. The prices are great especially considering the portion size. If you are looking for quality egg fu young this is the place to go. They even have bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Awful food. Worse Chinese food I have ever had. Me and my 2 boys love Chinese but this place has flavorless beef and broccoli, sour sesame chicken, nasty lo mein, and overcooked sweat and sour chicken. Not one thing tastes good. I am surprised it is still in business."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food & we just moved to the area so I am looking for our \"go to\" Chinese restaurant. This place is awful. I got the family dinner which is a good deal but all three dishes were dry & didn't taste very good at all. The eggrolls were way too greasy. Fried rice was a strange yellow died rice that I've never seen it before. I don't think I'll try it again. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this new Chinese Restaraunt and was amazed at the amount of food I got for the price off the lunch menu. It was good. Lady at counter was nice and friendly. Kitchen is open so you can watch them cook your food. Very nice place. I will return."}
