{"text":"Server Brian was really attentive and nice. Good happy hour specials"}
{"text":"Poor service!  I personally would recommend going anywhere but here. My group ended up leaving before we even ordered."}
{"text":"The food takes forever to arrive and it's nothing special, just frozen bar food you can literally make at home. The staff seems unhappy and the red headed manager even more so. I watched him leisurely stroll through the dining room all evening with his phone while occasionally stopping to look at the television. I'm not sure how the redbeards in Mt. Washington is so successful because I've never been to that one, but this one is HORRIBLE. Waste of time and money. I'd much rather go to Olive or Twist, or anywhere, really."}
{"text":"My review might be a bit skewed because I got to watch my Chicago Blackhawks win the 2015 Stanley Cup in this establishment, so I suppose it will forever be cemented in my heart.

HOWEVER -- that said, it ended up being a great place to actually catch the game.  Pierogies were delicious. Crab dip and pita chips were tasty. Nachos were well done (with even a few burnt edges).  Yuenglings were flowing. Water was constantly refilled.  The manager obliged to make sure the game was turned on in time and stopped by to make sure our needs were met.

And, of course, a special shout out to our server Megan who absolutely worked her TAIL off and offered up recommendations. She really did help make our night!"}
{"text":"Save your time - it's precious. Even though the place was empty enough to be seated immediately, it took over 45 minutes to get 2 dishes, and then 1 of them was wrong. Another 30 minutes later, the chicken wrap was finally done properly.  I guess they had to pluck and butcher a fresh bird.The server never even took our drink order. 

A manager gave us a paltry $3 off the check for this huge inconvenience.  

I emailed 5 days ago and have yet to hear anything from the management. Redbeards clearly does not value customers or want repeat business."}
{"text":"Sat down to order drinks with our slice of pizza from next door and they refused to serve us because we got a slice of pizza.  Who does that?! Bad business.... will never go here again!"}
{"text":"I will start that I wanted to give 0 stars, but the food was good, so 2 stars is what I'll settle on. It's a Friday evening during march madness, bar is practically empty with about 2 tables full and people sitting on one side of the bar. We go to the bar, grab the 4 chairs open at one end of the bar and the pens game is starting. I ask the bartender to put the pens game on one of the 3 televisions on our side of the bar which I am told \"the tvs are staying the way they are. It's march madness\". 4 seats open at the other side of the bar and we have to move so I can watch the pens game. Miraculously the pens game is now put on a tv from the side we had to move from.  
I will not be returning to this place!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this bar! Tony the bartender is amazing and makes the best martinis. Its got a chic laid back friendly feel."}
{"text":"Wow...this place. You'd think the man who invented splitting up checks was Einstein once you meet these people!!!  Took FOREVER To get out of their after we were finished eating, drinking and being merry. Last place I'll ever set foot in here, you be better off going to blush. Oh yeah, the volume on the jukebox is weaksauce too"}
{"text":"At the beginning had to wait awhile  for the waiter after complain with a manager everything went excellent food is good atmosphere is really nice after all everything went good thanks for the good time"}
{"text":"Headed to \"The Burg\" for a Pirates game and city tour. Stayed at the Renaissance Downtown and Redbeards is just down the block. Place is a two story clean well run city vibe bar. The beer is cold, solid tavern food and plenty of TV sports....Standing out food wise are the pierogies & the burgers. The \"cheese logs\" are just that, logs, be prepared to share...But the true stand out was the staff, friendly, professional and fun....The owner did a fine job hiring his staff...Did hit the Shiloh St place much more a tavern feel.... The Jersey Boys will be back...!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar food. Clean atmosphere. Great spot for after work happy hour. The bartenders are really friendly. 

It's my friends meeting spot for our after work hangouts."}
{"text":"With a party of 13, our waitress read us the happy hour specials and then turned our well drink orders into Jack and coke / Captain and coke and charged us $30 more than she should have. The GM backed her up and they wouldn't refund our money. When I went in to speak with another manager, he was rude and wouldn't even listen to my side of things. No refund, just a couple of gift cards instead. Very unhappy with their management."}
{"text":"Was here to eat on 10/4 before a show at Heinz hall.  I've heard good things about this place but have never stopped here before so tonight was the night to stop in and check it out and I'm glad I did.  The selection of food is the typical pub style food as you would expect from a bar but their selections were great I thought.  Overall this place is great and will be stopping in again when I'm in downtown for a bite to eat.  Great service and all the waiters and waitresses seemed to be on top of their game.  I would recommend to anyone wanting to check this place out."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Great food, great selection of brews, and the most awesome staff. I can't wait to come back to Pittsburg so I can hang out here again!! Thank you Becky for being a great bartender!!"}
{"text":"Sexist Manager.  I am a professional woman who attended lunch here a few weeks ago with two male coworkers.  The food was fine (not a big fan of canned mushrooms though) and the server was great.  However, mid-meal the manager came around to greet the tables.  Upon approaching our table he asks \"how is everything GENTLEMEN?\"  Although I was offended, I figured this may have been a mistake.  However, when the same manager came by 10 min later and looked the the full glass in front of me with an empty glass next to it - he looked to my coworker and asked \"Sir, is that your drink and you need another or is that hers and she is done with it?\"  I did not realize that in 2014 a manager for customer service would find it necessary to not address a woman directly.  Offended doesn't even begin to explain my outrage.  Unfortunately, I said nothing at the time - although I should have.  But I will never return to be treated so poorly or to patronize an establishment managed by such a blatantly sexist male."}
{"text":"Being a regular and going to Redbeards for over 4 plus years, I didn't see this coming, but then again. The change of management once again, I ask him which tv will have the Dallas game on, he said he didn't know, then he came and said the one at the other end of the bar, now mind you they have always had the same 3 games on both sides, so I ask to speak to the owner who I know and he said to me wrong ain't changing no tvs and again I ask to speak to the owner, he went over and talk with him, then the owner came over, I said you always have the same games on both side of the bar he gave me some BS answering saying he can't change the channels once they are set cause they ask people earlier where do they want to seat and watch the game, which is BS, like I said I've been a regular for 4 plus years and I know the routine, the bartenders put the stickers up on Saturday nights before they close, smfh, all I can say is WOW, didn't see that coming, but I guess as an business owner you have no LOYALTY to your customers nor regulars!"}
{"text":"Excellent wings.  Just what I was looking for.  Buffalo hot sauce is right on the money. Blue cheese was great, wings skins were crispy. Great place to grab a beer, watch a game and feast on wings."}
{"text":"I never write a review until I leave but this place has me a bit upset. When I walk in the guy say you should sit at the bar but oh you can sit anywhere but the bar is best. Ok I take it I need to sit at the bar. So I order food. Just 10 wings. They bring me only 9. Yep I'm at bit pissed off. I pay for 10 I'd like to have 10. If I ever return to Pittsburg I don't think I'd come back. Service is like 90 percent of the dining experience. When I told my bartender she just blew it off. I guess because they are by the baseball field they can do whatever! I'm so not happy! I also order tequilla Dobel $15 when I have gotten it for $4. Stick to beer. $3.75-7.00

For those who care or dare to try-maybe you'll have a better experience than me-the wings are good, all 9 if them."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, the service is very quick, the staff is marvelously attentive and checks the progress of patrons frequently."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour a few weeks ago and had great service until the managers got involved. We had well over fifteen people and they would not let us get another table. The bar area is too small upstairs to have a casual happy hour and we were told to sit, so give us some seats, maybe?  They also would not split out check even though the entire time we confirmed with the waiters what tab each item ordered was to go on. Why say yes when you're not going to do it?  

The manager was exceptionally rude to me and then when I questioned him he retreated to the back never to return. The red bearded men with headsets are the managers and they spend their time looking as busy as possible and forcing people to check in on this app, not considering the consequences of our unemployable experiences being reported to the app."}
{"text":"It's A Bar next to the ballparks Yep it smells like tap beer in the carpet. Hey That's ok, that's what a SPORTS BAR with GREAT WINGS is suppose to be! 
Long Straight bar plenty of TV's.OK NOW TO THE WINGS... CRISP ON THE OUTSIDE hot in the middle and not over cooked Jerky wings. I had them dusted in JERK so the allspice rings out, not spicy so I asked for a side of GREAT BALLS OF FIRE dipping sauce. Yep just another whacked out name for some not to hot east coast crap? BAM I was so exited when this orange sticky super sauce packed a PUNCH.... YEP ME EATIN my words FINALLY a wing sauce worth eating in the BURGH! Hats off RED literally
 all I had to take my hat off to wipe the sweat. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY. 
Swing on in grab a seat eat some wings'! TIP ALL YOU CAN EAT WINGS WEDNESDAY 9.99"}
{"text":"Two Saturday's ago, my husband and another couple went to the city to experience Christmas in Pittsburgh. We were all favorable toward Redbeards prior to, so we decided to go there for dinner. Unfortunately, the experience was a disaster from the moment we walked in. When we arrived, we told them of our reservation which they didn't have for us. The hostess went to the manager and we were told we could be placed in from of everyone, but making a reservation online doesn't guarantee a table that same night... isn't that the point of a reservation?After we got seated,we ordered waters, drinks, and wings as an appetizer. When we got our wings, we received no plates, napkins, or silverware for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes, one of us went up to ask for plates and napkins. It wasn't until he got back to the table where we realized the plates were dirty with not just residue on them, but sauces and lettuce... this was also after we hadn't gotten any refills for about 10-15 minutes. While we were still waiting patiently for our wraps and burgers that we ordered, the manager came over and said we may be moved because a large party was coming. He beat around the bush by telling us that when our food comes out \"we'll see if we can find you something downstairs\". Unfortunately, he did this to the table of men and women next to us, too. After we told him the sour experience we've been having he kept apologizing, however we'd still maybe have to move because the large party had reservations. When we told the manager we had reservations he asked if we made them on Yelp and ignored the fact. Our friend also told him how slow the service was and that we had to get our own plates and the manager interrupted him saying, \"Yes I gave you those\" enthusiastically, however when we showed him how dirty they were he kept apologizing and asked us to reconsider in the future. My husband, who doesn't anger easily, told him that if they move us we are leaving and the manager seemed fine with that saying they'd cover our expenses! If we weren't waiting so long for our food, it probably would have been our soon and we would have been out of there in time for the large party. The moral of this terrible experience is that the management didn't value us as customers. To disregard our reservations, have poor wait service, be given dirty dishes, and have a manager tell us we need to move so someone else can sit where we are? I've never experienced something like that before. It's a shame because Redbeards won't be getting our money any time soon."}
{"text":"no need to write long dramatic story. Beyond rude staff. Added 20% gratuity to a 4 person tab with service charge. Bartender cussed us out under her breath. Aggressive manager, yikes."}
{"text":"Food is ok.. Nothing special bar food. But the service is honestly shitty.... We waited 10 minutes to be greeted my a server, who was standing around the bar talking. It was not busy. This was our 3rd visit. And each time the service was terrible. We keep trying this place and get disappointed each time. :( prob won't be back again after this time."}
{"text":"We didn't know what to expect based on the exterior of the bar.  It looked a little shady from the outside, but once we stepped inside we were greeted with a very nice interior and a decent sized bar.  The bartender was extremely friendly and the food (a burger and the cheese sticks) was great!"}
{"text":"Came here from out of town great food great drinks and even better staff. Ashley was great and never let our drinks run low!"}
{"text":"Wow. We went to Pittsburgh for the weekend and this was our second stop. The service is amazing, attentive and super helpful if you're not from the area. The food is incredible. 

Being from Buffalo, we are partial to wings in the original place. These wings were Buffalo-approved and the drinks very satisfying. I would recommend to anyone they stop here, especially if it's summer. Loved the atmosphere, extremely welcoming and super friendly. 

All in all, an excellent experience and you are crazy not to stop here!"}
{"text":"Our family walked here after a show at the Byham Theater and it was absolutely delicious.  The manager was accommodating and rushed to find us a table.  The wait staff was fast and courteous and the food was outstanding.  Our party of six was pleasantly surprised at how amazing and delicious Redbeard's was!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The good was very good but the services was slow, I know that they were busy, i will have to say the wings special was a great deal."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Our food took a very long time with no updates or apologizes from waitress.  Table next to us who got seated a significant amount of time after us and got food before us. When food was brought two items were missing and we got a very rude response from waitress. Manager was not very sympathetic and tried to make jokes of our concerns. Overall, a very disappointing experience!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Delicious food. Had the portobello sandwich. An assortment of wings and the nachos appetizer. Nachos were a little skimpy on the meat but we still had no problem finishing them off. Nice variety of wing sauces. Service was great! Will be sure to stop in again."}
{"text":"Redbeard's has long been a place which I frequent. Since moving to Pittsburgh in 2007 I've been coming here (not sure why so many out of town people think its new, its far from new). They have a pretty good selection of beer. I wouldn't say they are a craft beer emporium or anything like that, but at least they value brews other than Coors Light and Bud Light.

Their menu has a pretty good variety of items on it. They do some more restaurant/dinner type entrees throughout the week as well. I would not say their wings are the best in da 'Burgh, but they are pretty good.

They recently revamped their menu and increased their prices(having worked in the restaurant industry for many years I understand the need to do this), but it seems they took off some our favorite items. For that I have to give it 4 stars.

They have a great outdoor seating area which is open almost year round. Others have complained about the loud music. I would agree. The music can be loud, but its  a bar folks!! If you want to watch the Pens, Steelers or Pirates play, you certainly can. Sit in the bar area and the volume is usually pretty loud.

They have a nice dining room for a bar too. You can request to sit in the far back room if its a more quite atmosphere in which you seek.

I recommend the chicken quesodilla or a burger. Just watch out, its build your own burger and they charge for each topping, but please, don't bark about the price. We all know you can make a burger at home for a buck or two(its one of the best money makers for a restaurant)."}
{"text":"Went to redbeards for dinner and drinks before a concert at the Benedum Center. Overall pretty unsatisfied with the food. We had pierogis, steak fries, and wings. If you are looking for ok bar food this place will suffice. Decent beer prices as well."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good sports bar TV coverage, all you can eat wings on Wednesdays that even a dieter could not resist, other food was pretty good as well but give it some time to get to four and more stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here this past Saturday night after a show at the Byham due to the kitchen closing at 11pm at our hotel. It wasn't crowded and even better the kitchen was open. The drinks were great. Even the iced tea my husband got was fresh brewed and not sitting around all night. I got the pierogi plate. They were just perfect. The serving size was great for a late night bite. Each pierogi had its own butter-sauteed red onion ring on it. The sour cream being in the middle helped keep it cold and not melting like some places. My husband had the Greek salad. The feta vinaigarette dressing was so good he was dipping his pita pieces into it and eating them that way. The salad was fresh and he cleaned his plate. We got the Noble Cheesecake for dessert. The texture was very smooth and silky. It was a chocolate caramel swirl topped with whipped cream and a chocolate drizzle. I would definitely take friends here for a late night bite or dinner and drinks during the game."}
{"text":"Megan is the best waitress ever!! The foid was good, the beers were a bit pricey but it IS downtown. There was a cool trivia thing going on but unfortunately we had to leave. All around decent but megan really made it great!! Give that girl a bonus and a raise"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited here before a Bucco game on a Wednesday night.  This was my fourth or fifth visit.  On Wednesday's they have All You Can Eat Wings for 9.99.  We opted for the wings.  Your initial order has 10 wings, then refills come in groups of five.  Redbeards has between 10-15 different wing sauces.

The wings were excellent!  Perfectly cooked, ample sauce on the weeks.  I had the buffalo garlic and cajun wings.  Refills came out in a reasonable time.  To top it off, we frequented during happy hour so 3.00 domestic drafts among other well drink/wine specials.

We sat at the bar.  Bartender was friendly, everything seemed very clean and ample TV's.  I will definitely return before Bucco games in the future and hopefully it will be on a Wednesday!  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"It was a rainy Friday night and while our umbrella kept us (mostly) dry, we used the excuse of \"getting out of the rain for a bit\" to stop at a couple of spots between where we were and our hotel. Redbeards was one of them. 

The staff was definitely friendly, and it wasn't crazy busy, but just busy enough that they were mostly occupied. Their drinks were just fine, and overall this place is A-OK!"}
{"text":"A couple of group came after us was able to get their food before us.  So of course we asked the server and she said it's because our group was to big. It doesn't justify that we had to wait for an hour for the food and never came back to refill our water.  So we all left...

Without being apologetics she was just rude."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Went in late on a MONDAY for a couple beers. I like the ipa's. The beers were 10.00 each! AYFKM! My buddy got Liney and they were 7.00. Never again Redbeard!  You got me this time...but you won't anymore!"}
{"text":"Met up with some friends on a Sat night for some dinner/drinks.  I was ready for a wait, as Sat night most places are busy.  I was surprised when we were seating immediately and there wasn't many people eating (also worried..why is nobody eating?).

The place is smaller than i expected, but there is another bar and seating upstairs which we didn't know about.  Our waitress was quick and very nice.  Food was typical bar style food, burgers, fries, wraps, salads, etc.  Prices seemed fair.  I got a Yuengling bottle for 3.75 and a turkey wrap for around $10.  Their weekly specials were impressive (AYCE Crab legs on monday ~$27, AYCE wings on Wed ~$10, $1 tacos on Tuesday).

My only gripe is the cost my fiance's Moscow Mule..$12 bucks!  This isn't an upscale place, idk what they're thinking charging that much.  They're lucky I didn't catch the price before she ordered it.

Overall, food was good and arrived quick.  Service was very good and our meal was less than 50 even with the stupid ass 12$ moscow mule so that was a plus.  I'll be back soon and try out the AYCE wings."}
{"text":"Working downtown, Redbeards is a go to happy hour spot for me and my co workers. We called ahead as we always have and requested they reserve tables. We had a large party, about 15-20 ppl coming at various times. On the phone they said okay, as this has never been a problem. Well today we get there at 3:45 and as we walk up the steps a gentleman in a blue button down shirt who i assume was the manager starts shooing us back down the stairs telling us we cannot come up there until 4pm. This has never happened. When they finally let us upstairs they had ONE table with about 8 chairs even tho we told them ahead of time how many ppl we had. There were several empty tables surrounding us but we were told we couldn't take them because they were reserved for other people as they expected to be busy due to the pirate game. This was odd to me because we were paying customers and they were making us stand when there were empty tables available? Well no one ever came to occupy them so we ended up just sitting there because standing was getting old. Our waiter did his best considering but the manager was SO RUDE and it ended up being chaotic. I think we'll take our happy hours elsewhere."}
{"text":"We rented out the top floor for a private party and the staff was fantastic. The food was great and the bartenders really took care of us. I would highly recommend the upstairs for a private event."}
{"text":"Done here! This place sucks. This is the third time I've had to wait over 40 minutes for a damn sandwich and this time they prepared it like shit. Management here is terrible and I have no idea how they stay in business.."}
{"text":"I gave Redbeards a second chance, and I was very pleased with my experience this time. Redbeards is pretty much the only restaurant downtown where you can order late night food. Not only do they serve food until 1AM, but they also serve their entire menu. 

I ordered the quesadillas, which were exceptionally tasty. I like how they put olives and jalapeños in them. I did not have to wait too long for them, and the bartender was nice and pleasant. Overall, I believe that this restaurant and sports bar is a solid staple in the downtown community."}
{"text":"This is a sports bar in downtown Pittsburgh with a long narrow setup. There is a bar along the wall with six screens behind the bar. On the other side there are tables. It has the layout of a bar, not a restaurant with a bar attached. 

I came in and sat at the bar and asked for a screen to be changed to a game I wanted to watch. They obliged; there was not much else going on in sports. 

The beer list has about 10 or so drafts, though not everything on their published beer list is in stock. I asked for a Dogfish 60 Minute IPA, but it was out of stock so I ordered a Southern Tier IPA. 

The food menu is standard sports bar fare, with a selection of burgers and sandwiches. I ordered a Tuscan chicken sandwich, which was fine, but the menu said it came with steak fries but instead came with chips. 

The main problems were in the service area. They had one overtaxed bartender working behind the bar, who had a little trouble keeping up with all her patrons. To top it all off, they committed what I feel was a violation of sports bar etiquette: despite the fact that I specifically asked to watch an NBA game, when the Pirates game started and a patron asked to see the Pirates, they proceeded to turn all six screens to the Pirates game. Despite being a violation of etiquette, it was unnecessary as the bar was not crowded and there weren't Pirates fans throughout the bar.  At other bars I go to, they leave a screen on a game in progress that a patron is watching, or at a minimum they could ask if is OK to switch the game.  This bar would do well to heed that rule. 

The prices turned out to be a little on the high side. The IPA was $7 for a draft. That's kind of high, as I can usually get drafts of similar quality for $5.50 or $6.00."}
{"text":"The. Downtown location has a great bar and atmosphere.   The food was good a very filling grilled chicken sandwhich and some awesome sweet potato fries.  The bartender was very personable. Never lacked in service and offered to put a game on which was hard to see at the end if the bar.   He's a keeper!  

 I would have stayed and drank for quite a while if it wasn't for having to listen to a waitress stand at the end of the bar, cuss like a sailor, and complain about her job the entire time!  Made me feel like I was having dinner on the Jerry springer show set."}
{"text":"If I could give them negative stars I would. They sat us and we waited for 20 mins...and still no one had taken our order or even acknowledged us. I eventually went to the bar to see if a waiter or waitress could come over and the bartender told me we wouldn't be getting a waiter so we had to just order from her. It was absolutely ridiculous. Several tables around us were getting served so there is no reason they should have sat us without a waiter accessible. The food looked disgusting anyways so we ended up just leaving."}
{"text":"A fun place to go downtown after work or games, etc. A little overpriced, but you expect that in this area (downtown). A good number of TVs for watching games and a casual atmosphere. I would recommend this if you're looking for a good place to go to after work. Happy hour deals aren't the best, but again it's downtown. All you can eat wings on Wednesdays! That's always a plus."}
{"text":"Worst Christmas ever...coming from out of town we wanted to watch the Steeler game and this was open. First they ran out of ranch dressing after we order all foods that we use it...who runs out of ranch?? Go get some?? Then I said please no lettuce or tomato on my sandwich...she drops it off and says sorry they put it on then walks away..then my sisters burger was so gross we all tried it it tasted old and like a ball of salt and too well done and we normally don't like to send back food that's why I kept my sandwich but her burger was so bad we had to send it back...whatever bad experience and bad food we chalked it up to...however, now my sister has food poisoning she has been up all night sick and not left the restroom...seriously like ruined our night and our Christmas her getting sick...we were just trying to do something different since our dad just passed two months ago...we should have stayed home and cooked..."}
{"text":"We did a little pregame drinking here (and when I mean a little, I actually mean a lot).

We basically got here around 1 and killed a few hours before the 4pm Steelers game.

Ordered a bunch of deep fried goodness to go along with said beer.

Server dude was great.  There were TVs.. There were football games on.  Drank said beer.  A good time was had by all."}
{"text":"Very cool, clean and reasonably priced place to eat in Downtown Pittsburgh. Food was awesome too.  Will revisit next time we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Good simple bar. Decent food, service was fine. Nothing to knock your socks off but an enjoyable experience and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Color me impressed.  After reserving a table of 10 for a pre-show birthday dinner I started to wonder what had gotten into me.  I was going to pick the meatball joint, but \"no reservations\" scared me away.  I didn't really want to go upscale, so Redbeard's seemed to be a good choice.  I started with several $4 Captain and Diet Cokes, so my evening was grrrreat.  But I also enjoyed our spring roll appetizer and my grilled chicken breast w/jalapeno & cheese wing sauce.  The sweet potato waffle fries rounded out a delightful bar meal and our service was overall good.  Keep Redbeard's in mind for a group meal. The upstairs is spacious and has a good vibe. AND they take reservations, which is a welcome change from the many downtown establishments which do not. What's up with that, btw?"}
{"text":"Redbeard's on Sixth is one of my favorite downtown bars.  It's got your basic bar food and a good draft list.  It's nice and clean but without a lot of bells and whistles other downtown bars think they need.

Service is friendly.  Redbeard's is one of my standard reliable places for pre- or post-game drinks.  This place gets four stars just for having my essentials."}
{"text":"Went to grab a late night drink here with my friends. Ordered the round from the bar and then tried to sit at one of the many empty tables. We were stopped by people who worked there and were told we were not allowed to sit at a table because we order drinks from the bar. The bar had no empty seats so my friends and I ended up having to stand in heels next to the bar which was like 3 feet away from a whole row of empty tables. It was ridiculous and the bartender had an attitude. Won't be back again."}
{"text":"As stated in my tip we went to Redbeard's on 6th after seeing a great play at the Pittsburgh Public Theater.  First time there and the place was pretty busy.  They have an upstairs and a downstairs bar and some tables on both levels too.  The hostess suggested we try upstairs as it wasn't as busy.  And it wasn't so we easily got a seat.  

The place is nice, I can't complain about the décor.  They also had many beers on draft including crafts, and like a broken record I ordered me a Southern Tier IPA... It was glorious.  We looked over the menu for a while and I decided on a Ball Park Burger, cooked pink added jalapenos to it, and the vegetable of the day for the side.  The H got a flat bread they made special as a BBQ chicken one.  The bartender seemed really nice, and pretty attentive.  

As we waited for our food to come the upstairs started to get busier and busier, which also includes louder and drunker.  I can't exactly blame the bar for this but I absolutely can't stand someone putting their hand on the back of my chair, putting their foot on the foot rest and squeezing in every five minutes to order 5 crazy shots for him and his drunk friends!  So there was that.  How fun is it to eat with a stranger leaning on you????  Yea it ain't.  

So some more time passes and someone from the kitchen comes out to tell me they don't have any more vegetables.  Ok so I got the slaw, no biggy, so about 5 minutes later our food comes out.  The burger tasted good but alas they forgot the bacon on the burger! I am now kind of fighting to get the bartenders attention due to the spike in the rowdy, young, drunk crowd.  I asked nicely, \"Isn't this supposed to have bacon on it?\"  She rolled her eyes and said \"yea let me guess they forgot?\"  ding, ding, ding, and the winner goes to... Yea so anyhow she brings the bacon and I only ate  1/2 because I am trying to eat smaller portions, you know swimsuit season is right around the corner...  Well it was a good thing I only ate  1/2 cause my H was still really hungry.  The flatbread was small not a great size, and I usually get flatbread envy when he orders them, but not this time.  We were getting ready to leave and got our check.  I was a little upset they charged $.75 for me to add jalapenos when they almost stiffed me on bacon, and didn't have the side I ordered and didn't know it until 15 minutes after I ordered.  We scooped ourselves up and left.

Summary, food was ok, nothing spectacular.  Cool bar, nice bartender, but I am over being sandwich in my stool by a bunch of hammered college students... Though I'm not too old to recall how many moons ago, I was but one of them..."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of four.  They did not have enough seating due to reservations but could seat us at two two tops.  Upon leaving reserved tables STILL weren't taken (1.5 hours passed).  Someone should be supervising the seating a little better if they want to make more money and serve more customers. Dinners took forever and tables sat well after us were served before us (same meals).  Food mediocre.  Friends fries were ice cold.  Hubby had potatoes with his dinner and the portion was disgraceful (should've taken a photo - was the joke of the night). Drinks were served all to wrong people and each person was asked as they were served what they ordered - we fixed it after tasting each beer (bad mistakes for server for guests to straighten out the orders). Good thing we can taste the difference between an IPA and a sour beer!   Not worth the money to stop here for a mediocre meal and be served a beer that isn't correct - unless you want everyone in your party to sip it and tell which beer goes with which person.   Good thing we are all good friends but overall service and food just is unacceptable.  Also they cannot provide enough menus for food and beer to tables without waiting for other tables to finish using them.  Again good thing we were friends and could share menus upon finishing using them. For an establishment to not have an adequate amount of menus when they are not full and busy is strange.   Seems like a simple investment when you have paper beer menus and could invest in a few more food menus.  Just a thought if you're selling food and beer.  Hate to leave bad reviews but give credit where it's due.  This place could use some improvements for service and basic needs for customers."}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars - I would - this place treats their customers unjustly and I will never return and neither will any of my friends. Way too many other great bars in the city of Pittsburgh to waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! Wing night was a bust, they were flavorless and over fried,  dry as a bone. Several people actually walked out. The music was way too loud and the sports were missing from the \"atmosphere\".  The only good thing was the beer was cold."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! By far the cleanest and nicest sports bar in Pittsburgh. Was there football Sunday with some friends and WOW!! What a place! Wings were great! Servers were great! Had 3 different managers come and talk to us, 2ladies and a big guy, all three were very professional and seemed to be very caring and having fun. Great senses of humor we teased them bout saying y'all instead of yins they were super friendly. Beer was cold, plenty of tv's both upstairs and downstairs. We will for sure be back! It's great to see a crew that smiles and has fun and that all the managers were having fun and smiling also the place was very busy and yet everyone talked to us. Other places need to take a chapter out of Redbeards book, they do it right!! Can't wait for next visit probably going for their ugly Christmas sweater party seems like fun! See \"y'all\" soon Redbeards!"}
{"text":"Always a good time here.  Great food, lots of big tvs and of course delicious adult beverages."}
{"text":"Our waitress was pretty rude and took a long time to take our drink and food orders (it wasn't that crazy busy). People who arrived after us were taken care of before we were. The specials weren't all that great either. A lot of other Pittsburgh bars offer drink specials during Pens games and this place didn't. I wouldn't recommend this bar as there are far better bars/restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"There isn't anything wrong with the place, but the only thing really right is its proximity to the Roberto Clemente bridge. Sixteen different beer taps, mostly mega brews. Full bar, bar food. $30 (pre-tip) for lunch for 2. (Just iced tea to drink) so it's pricier than I really was looking for."}
{"text":"The all you can eat wings on Wednesday for $9.99 is a great deal.  I couldn't even eat the first portion.  Unlike some places that give you the \"junior\" wings, their \"special\" wings are jumbo as well.  Bartender actually paired a wine with Buffalo wings.  Now that's talent!"}
{"text":"It was my first business trip, first time eating out by myself,  and I just wanted a beer and watch Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals to see the Blackhawks beat the Ducks. The service was friendly,  food good,  and the Hawks won. 

Nothing special about the burger I ate as it was your usual bar comfort food. The bartender was nice, which only added on top of the friendly service. Had a great conversation with random strangers about what it will be like once the Kenny Chesney concert let's out. 

Overall,  I enjoyed the experience and left feeling welcomed to the city of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Go here to watch games if you are downtown.  So many TVs, great amount of bar space and two floors of tables.  The food is pretty good; it's bar food!

Get the wings with the hot buffalo sauce, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Arguably the worst food I've ever had. Chicken was dry, Flatbread was atrocious and the service was sub par. The only amiable thing they have to offer is good TV's and a good location."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Nice staff, awful food. If you want uncooked chicken wings, come here!!!! Mt. Wash location is legit, not downtown PGH. Avoid food at all costs, drinks are great"}
{"text":"This review is about drinks ONLY.  We did not get their food.

When my fiance and I were visiting Pittsburgh recently, we ended up at Redbeard's on Sixth so we could try out their happy hour before we had dinner at nearby Tako.

The outside has a bit of a divey appearance.  We were pleasantly surprised by the inside.  The bar was really nice and they had a lot of seating and multiple floors.  

They had a really nice drink selection and a lot of tvs  that were showing sports.  It's a perfect place to catch a game.

My only complaint with this spot is that the service was painfully slow at times.  Also, we tried to close out but the waitress completely misunderstood us and brought us another round, instead.  We just rolled with it but it took a really long time to get our checks and I ended up having to leave by myself in order to make it to our dinner reservation while my fiance stayed behind to handle the check.  

I am hoping the bad service was a one-time thing but the three stars this place has leads me to believe that I might be wrong.  Hopefully they can get that aspect sorted out because otherwise, it is a great place."}
{"text":"This place needs to decide if it's a juke joint or a sports bar - constant interruption of the Army Navy game audio with jukebox selections ...I love the Eagles, but I selected this place to watch a football game not listen to the 70's greatest hits!"}
{"text":"Well, we were ready to just hang out and have a few drinks.  Bar was full so we stood next to a table that had one chair.  A very rude young lady with long blonde hair informed us this was \"her\" table.  Ok, we will be ordering more drinks!  Then, the hostess comes by placing a sign \"please see hostess for availability\".  Ok, I guess we were too close to the table for the waitresses liking!! She could have said \"Hello!  If you all need another drink, I can take care of you!\" But no, a quick admonishment and the \"sign\"!  Needless to say, we did not want to stand right in the middle of the traffic flow so we left.  Had a great time down the street;  Sharp Edge.  Spent a lot of money on food and beverages.  We are also great tippers.  Too bad blondie!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped into Redbeard's for a night of college football. We had to wait for a table and decided to get a drink at the bar. There were no spaces, but we were happy to learn that there was another bar upstairs with ample standing room. I ordered our drinks, which were okay-mixed cocktails but was pretty astounded when I got the bill. 21 bucks for 2 mixed drinks. A little much for a sports bar, no? However, Redbeard's downtown seems to have upped its game from its Mt. Washington location. It is definitely a bit more trendy feeling, which was fine, but that comes with a price tag. The bars have a ton of big screen TVs, which made it very fun and easy to watch multiple games at once.

We finally got seated and ordered our meals. They were very careful about my food allergies, which was great. The manager came over multiple times to make sure our meals were to our liking and allergen free. Wonderful customer service!

The food was pretty damn good. I got a bowl of the chili, which is homemade (and free of top 8 allergens!) and the steak salad. They fry in soybean oil, so avoid that if you have the allergy. My husband got dry-rubbed cajun wings and loved them. Our bill was reasonable for the food, so that was a plus. Just be wary of the high drink prices!"}
{"text":"Yesterday we visited Red Beards for a quick lunch before the Pirates game. We got there around noon and proceeded up the steps as the downstairs was full, there was no one at the podium to greet us, and no signage saying to see the hostess. On the second level we were greeted by a clearly flustered server telling us to see the hostess downstairs to be seated. So we went back down the steps. The hostess then took us upstairs to seat us. Okay, fine, I burned a few calories. When we got back upstairs the hostess tried to sit us and the same flustered server stopped her, said some inaudible things about another sever, yada yada yada, so we get led to a different table (maybe in a different servers section but at any rate this should have been seamless to us, the customer). 

After about 5 minutes a nice young lady comes and takes our drink order. This is about 12:05 at this point. She comes back about 12:10 and delivered said drinks and takes our order. Great! We are on par to make it to the game by 1. She stops back over about 12:20 and delivers small plates, says it should not be much longer. 12:30 she won't make eye contact. 12:40 she breezes past our table and ignores us calling to her. 12:50 and still no food. Now we ordered nachos, fried zucchini, and a chicken wrap. There is no WAY it should have taken 40 minutes to make this food. There were empty tables all around us. Since our server would not acknowledge us and we waited 40 minutes and still did not have food we got up and walked out. 

Not to mention it was SO LOUD!!! They had the sound for the TV blaring and I had to yell at someone sitting a foot from me. 

Super disappointing and not going back."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but on 2 occasions in a row now I've ordered the daily and/or game special and have been charged the full price by the same bartender. You shouldn't have to request the for the special pricing. Needless to say the food is good and the atmosphere is pleasing."}
{"text":"Came here for a farewell celebration for a co-worker. Laid-back atmosphere and good service. Had the wings and they were really good."}
{"text":"Stopped before coming to a show at heinz hall. We ordered the inside out grilled cheese. It was awesome! I'm usually weary about ordering grilled cheese anywhere since you can make so cheap at home but the waiter suggested it. Stuffed with cheese, bacon, tomato, then burnt cheese wrapped around the bread. It was large portion and could only eat half. Definitely a must order. Leftovers were just as good. Waiter was friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"I had a nice time here. Professional and friendly bartender open late and serving food until one. Hard to beat downtown."}
{"text":"Service is satisfactory. I had a chicken cranberry walnut salad. The salad was below average as it was served with iceberg lettuce and little amount of walnuts.  No bread is served with the salad but the price was fair for $6.99 what do you expect! Their soups are very good."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Cajun wings and beer after Bucs game.  The wings were crispy (requested style) and the flavor was OK.  The dry rub Cajun style needed to have more zing it I ate it all.  Spartan appointments."}
{"text":"Stopped here before a show at the Byham. Service was fast, and food was solid. No complaints. 

We got appetizers and drinks. Great place to stop in the cultural district!"}
{"text":"Wow crowed!  Friday at 5 it is busy!  Have a few good beers on tap.  The service is slow, but like I said, it is crowed for happy hour!  I met a group there and we did get a table.  I will definitely give it another try for happy hour.  I would say the only part part is parking...It is down town."}
{"text":"Heather the bar tender is fantastic. She was super nice and helpful. The food was great. The atmosphere was good and plenty of tv's to watch the game. Definitely a place to stop at when in town."}
{"text":"I'll give this a 4 only because I typically reserve a 5 for more \"fine dining\".  But this place is great!

Here are the things I liked about it...

-Over the bar there are 6-8 very large screen TVs.  I came in on a night when the Pirates had a chance to clinch a playoff spot and asked if they'd turn on another game for me (I'm not local).  They had no problem with this.  And they were quick about it.  They also have subscriptions to many channels, so it wasn't difficult.  This said, if you want to watch a non-Pittsburgh team, this is the best bar in the city to go 
-I sat at the bar.  Wasn't too crowded on a Wednesday night.  Good service and friendly bartenders
-Very good beer selection.  All the basics, a few local brews
-Menu was typical \"pub food\" but they had a VERY wide range of selection of sauces for their wings to the point they compete with the likes of Buffalo Wild Wings in that regard.  I ordered the cheesy jalapeño at the suggestion of the bartender, and they didn't disappoint.  Their house made chips were also really good

I'll definitely go back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Even the management is rude. Told our grandmother and grandfather they weren't allowed to sit at a table because they weren't ordering food. That was the start of it. The bar is boring with nothing good about it the only reason we went was because of proximity to the hotel. How they stay in business no idea"}
{"text":"Service was wonderful. She was attentive and kind. However, it did not compensate for the laziness of the kitchen. My first batch of wings where served cold with an improperly made \"Giddy Up\" sauce which is a flavor I have all the time.... The server kindly apologized and took the wings away. A few moments later we were handed back the same batch of wings that obviously had been microwaved do to how soggy the wings had become. (Still with that mystery white sauce). I bit into the wing and even with the microwaving, the wing was bloody and raw on the inside. 

The manager came over once and offered to get us something else. After the initial lack of effort put into our initial meal, I declined as did my friend who was also uncomfortable with the kitchen. 

I won't be back to this Red Beards. I will still however frequent the Mt Washington location where the kitchen cares about what comes out to the customer.  



(This was not the first bad experience at this location, but it will now be the last.)"}
{"text":"Antoinette is the best hostess/waitress going. Great bar and great service from your you Alaskan chapter of Steeler Nation!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for happy hour downtown! They have different specials each day and great daily specials. It was $4 house wines the day I was there. I haven't eaten here yet, but am intrigued by some of their daily food specials like All You Can Eat Crab Legs on Mondays! There is plenty of seating at the bar and the bartenders have always been great. Convenient location to the North Shore and Cultural District."}
{"text":"Great local bar .. Madison is THE best waitress ever!!!! She made our experience at redbeards!!!! Quick with drinks, and had a fantastic sense of humor!!"}
{"text":"Eh, I wasn't particularly impressed with my time at Redbeard's.

The good: On Wednesdays all day, they have all you can eat wings and chips for $10. Great deal considering 10 wings off of their menu are $10 themselves. You can only choose one flavor at a time. You start off with ten and then receive them by 5's. For my first batch, I tried the honey bbq which was good (i love honey bbq) The second batch, I ordered the Redbeard's Signature sauce- sweet chili sauce, BBQ sauce & some hot sauce. I really enjoyed that sauce. Their chips are nice too and are seasoned with a litte kick of something.. can't put my finger on it.

The Average: Everything else. Our service really wasn't too good. She seemed to be new and we waited awhile to put in our order. In her defense, I do believe she was new  because she pulled out a list whenever we asked her what the craft beer options were. For drinks, we started off with a long island each.. terrible! Too much Sours were in that drink which literally can ruin the drink.. and it did. Also, at the end of the night we found out that each long island was $12. wtf?! $24 on 2 crappy drinks? We gulped the drink to get it over with then ordered 2 vodka and orange juice.. aka a tall glass of OJ and a splash of vodka. So in conclusion on drinks.. We spent $20 each on drinks  ($40 total) and didnt even walk out of there with a buzz. -_- Also, Bobby ordered the stuffed mushrooms with crab (appetizer) to eat. It was completely bland and both the mushroom and crab were not seasoned. It would've been completely delicious with a nicely seasoned mushroom and a tad of old bay on the crab.

The menu seemed large and had nice selections.. pub food plus some entrees. If we do stop back it will be for all you can eat wings.. and we will stop there. Totally disappointed with both the food & drinks for what the final bill ended up being :("}
{"text":"We went to this establishment because they said they'd change the tv to the World Cup. Everyone was excited about this... This isn't just our table but the other tables on our side of the restaurant. Joe (the manager) decides to walk over and change the game. His reason being ithat there was a Pirates game on. 

Someone just asked for the World Cup as I'm writing this and they said they were threatened with being written up if they changed the game.

Joe is a jerk and wouldn't even compromise or anything. 

One star. Our waitress Sydney is awesome. Joe is awful just plain awful.

Update: Dustin came in and changed the TV back to Fifa World Cup. He's awesome.. It only took 30 extra minutes of missing the game because of Joes selfish, unreasonable decision.   I'm giving this place a two star now instead of one.  Thanks Dustin."}
{"text":"Stopped in upon the recommendation of our hotel's front desk when we inquired about a family-friendly restaurant downtown.  
While there was no official kids menu, there were quite a few kid-friendly options already on the menu (I.e chicken tenders, grilled cheese, burgers & fries, etc.). 
Redbeards is set up with a bar on the 1st & 2nd floors...and tables surrounding.  While I'm sure it wouldn't be appropriate to bring kids there after dinner hours, the staff made us feel completely welcome bringing our kids in for dinner before the hockey game.  
Ordered some pretty basic lunch-type food (taco salad, flatbread sandwich, pretzel & chicken tender app, and a cheese-only hoagie).  The service was outstanding, and they were beyond friendly and welcoming.  
The only catch was...when our bill came, that cheese-only hoagie they were so nice to make for one of our kids...they charged us $10 for that!  In fact...we only ordered soft drinks (no alcohol), and the items mentioned above...and our bill was $60!
I guess that's the going rate for these downtown places...but for  lunch-type items...this still seemed a little steep.
Aside from that...the food was great, the service outstanding, and it had a relaxed atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend...just be prepared...it's not an inexpensive place."}
{"text":"Came to this bar on a whim; was hoping for a better atmosphere and was disappointed. My friends and I were looking for a place to relax and watch the baseball game and when we asked the server if the TV could be changed we were told we have to wait for the hockey game to be over. Even though there were 5 tv's showing the game with no one watching it. Sure no problem, then we asked another server what kinda of wheat beers they had on tap not only did she have no idea but she also did not know the prices to what she was offering. The menu did not have beers prices hence the reason why we had to ask. Then proceeded to stand around and gossip with the other girls, while the bartender threw ice cubes at the waitresses. I gave this restaurant 2 stars for their employees lack of knowledge before putting them on the floor, and not being very attentive."}
{"text":"Was less than impressed with Redbeard on 6th. The waitress took our order, brought the drinks and disappeared. After asking my husband how he was enjoying the nachos, he told her that he wasn't really. She told him that they weren't known for the nachos. After a while, i had to ask another server for our check. Mind you, there was only one other table occupied. After getting the check, we continued to wait to cash out. I finally got up to go pay. There was a bartender, two people at a table wrapping flatware and a waitress watching the pre-interviews of a preseason Steeler game, none were paying attention the dining area. I won't be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"I'm not even joking best fried pickles I've ever had. Also, our waiter Kyle was so helpful and had a great sense of humor. Go for the pickles, but stay for Kyle.

I can't say how good anything else is on the menu, except the sauerkraut and potato pirogies were also good."}
{"text":"Great little quaint sports bar !!!! Power play burger was just incredible a must have on your visit (if you like spicy of course) we'll return"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer after leaving a recent Pirates game early (it was cold!). 

Rather nondescript place, devoid of any personality--seems like they're going for an upscale sports bar vibe--but I think they just opened the week before, so I'll allow them some growing pains. Odd scene: they had sound on for Pirates game, then, as Bucs were two batters from closing out the game, they start blasting music? After Pirates game ends (as does the one song), they put sound back on for Pens game. Inexplicably, in last two minutes of that game, they again start blasting music? Weird.

Anywho, after a couple beers, my buds and I headed out into the night. Don't think I'd come back on my next trip to the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows I'm a sucker for all of can eat wings especially with the few cheat meals I have. I stopped in for lunch with my cousin and found out it was all you can eat wings for 12.99. The wings turned out to be just okay and they were missing my favorite flavor(lemon pepper) but the hostess was extremely nice and it has that great Pittsburgh atmosphere I love whenever I visit downtown. I will be back in a few months to try them again and try a few different flavors"}
{"text":"I am staying at the Marriott property down the street from this restaurant.  I enjoy when you can find a decent meal within walking distance of where I am staying. Tonight the Patriots are playing so I wanted a venue that would offer a healthy fare and televisions to watch the game. Red Beards offers this! I started with the chips, salsa and queso appetizer. The chips had the right amount of salt. The queso was a unique flavor and I really enjoyed  it! The salsa was more like a pico and was very fresh. I ordered the beef taco salad and was extremely pleased. The dressing was spicy on the tongue but flavorful. The presentation was very colorful and appealing.I picked off the jalapeños because I am not able to stomach those but they made it look really pretty. I ordered a cocktail from the menu which has pineapple juice and rum. It made me feel like I was in the Caribbean as I watched the patriots play. The person next to me ordered the French onion soup who said it was good. There were plenty of onions and broth. They also ordered the steak hoagie and they devoured it! It was full of meat but not a messy sandwich. Megan W. was my waitress and she was timely, efficient and very sweet. She met every request without hesitation or delay. The establishment is clean and comfortable. If I return to Pittsburgh I will definitely come back here! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a Pirates game last night. We chose it because it wasn't busy - we should have heeded the warning!

I thought we couldn't go wrong with a restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh because most everything we had was so good. Well this place was so bad. 

The only reason they get two stars is because they were friendly and it was clean. But that's as far as the \"good\" goes. 

We ordered some pretty basic stuff, and it took quite a long time to receive even though they were not busy. 

Taco salad - chicken was very dry and tasteless, the rest was just boring

Soup of the day - this was described as tomato soup with meatballs, \"like Italian wedding soup but with a red sauce\". All four of us are willing to bet money it was a can of spaghetti-Os!

French onion soup - also tasted canned

I rarely give bad reviews. But I would have liked to have known myself how bad this was. And the kicker is, it was expensive. Sigh

Live and learn"}
{"text":"Very good. I went with coworkers the day before thanksgiving. It was a Wednesday which is wing day - $12.99 for unlimited and they didn't skimp. It was no wait and food came out fast for a group of 8. One coworkers was a vegetarian and they were able to accommodate.
It was fairly quiet inside during lunch. Could've been that many people took off from work that day. That made it easy to hear and quicker service. I enjoyed a bacon turkey wrap with fries. The portion of fries was on the smaller side but still seasoned well and tasted good. 
Overall very good- basically what I'd expect from a burger place with god service and i had no complaints at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I were downtown to see a show and stumbled upon Redbeards after encountering a wait at the restaurant we had planned to dine at beforehand. Redbeards was busy on a Friday evening around 5:30, but they had tables available (they have two spaces, upstairs and downstairs). They call themselves a sports bar, and there certainly are some TVs, but the music was turned up SO LOUD that it made the place feel almost club-like. 

Anyway, from 4-6 on Mondays through Fridays they have happy hour specials, so we were able to catch the tail end of those... $2.00 off appetizers, as well as drink specials. The menu is mostly pretty standard bar fare. We ordered 3 appetizers (pretzel sticks, mozzarella logs, and pierogies), as well as a half dozen wings. Well, let me clarify...we attempted to order a half dozen wings. The music was so loud that it was hard to converse with the waitress (and ourselves, frankly), so she must've thought we just said a \"dozen\" wings, because that's what we were brought. Similarly, we tried to order queso sauce with our pretzel sticks, but I don't think she heard that either, because the dip accompanying the pretzels was definitely not queso. 

The food was solid bar food. The mozzarella logs were big rectangular hunks of fried cheese with a tasty marinara dipping sauce...who can't get on board with that? Frankly, I might eat all of my food in log shapes from now on. The pretzel sticks were soft and warm with just the right amount of salt. My biggest complaint about those is that I didn't care for the dipping sauce that accompanied them. I have no idea what it was, but it definitely wasn't the queso we ordered. Maybe a mustard of some kind? It had a really strong fake smoke flavor that I hated, although my hubby thought it was super tasty, so different strokes, I guess. The pierogies were also respectable. Not the best I've ever had by a long shot, but they were seasoned well and had plenty of fluffy potato and cheddar filling. I would've liked them to be a little more buttery and served with onions, but they were pretty tasty as is. Lastly, the honey mustard wings were quite delicious. They were perfectly fried, very meaty, and the sauce was sweet and tangy. 

Overall, we were satisfied with our food, especially since everything (except the wings) was $2 off because of the happy hour. If we had paid full price, however, I'd probably be less pleased, because the regular prices here are very expensive (both food and drinks). You're definitely paying a premium for the location. Note that if you check in on Yelp (at least as of the time of this review), you'll receive 10% off of your bill, but it's not valid on already-discounted food (i.e. happy hour) or any alcohol. Service was very prompt and efficient.

I'll probably return when I'm in the area during happy hour....I just hope next time they'll turn down their damn music! (Why yes, I do have a collection of children's frisbees that have landed in my yard, why do you ask?) :)"}
{"text":"Good food, but really not a REAL sports bar as advertised. A few pictures on the wall and 7 TV's doesn't make you a sports bar."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports.  Will show just about any game.  Great bar food selection as well.   Yum yum.  Vast beer selection.  So you will be comfortable and have a good time.  Not to loud either.  Enjoy one and then another."}
{"text":"Went there for the wings which were so-so. We had to wait forever for our food and then for  our check. Next time I'll just go to Quaker State and Lube."}
{"text":"We can to get a quick bite, prior to a show. For a Friday night, and all of the events going on this particular evening, i was anticipating a wait and a big crowd. 
It was busy, but not to walk packed. We were sat immediately. The service was quick and the server was friendly and attentive. The food came out timely and was good. 
The restaurant has two floors. A bar and dining room on each. It's kid friendly and clean for a bar. In my opinion, more so than their Mt Washington location.
We look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on recent business trip. Tried the \"Taco night special\", was informed it was a minimum of 4, so ordered although it didn't say that on menu. 
Tacos were small, very scant on filling, and pretty much flavorless.  Asked for hot sauce, Tabasco was only one available. Decided to try a cup of chili, as tacos weren't even close to filling. Chile tasted of green peppers and tabasco, no other flavors evident, near no meat either. 

Although door staff and waiter were very nice, I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"it's a cozy sports bar. Went for late lunch not to busy but was starting to fill up when people were getting off work. Food was good. I had turkey bacon wrap and sweet potato waffle fries. The waffle fries are good! Full bar and had a decent drink special.. Although looked like too many wait staff some were just standing around talking. Our waitress was kinda rough not amazing service but overall good place."}
{"text":"Met a group of people on a weekday late afternoon.   People in our group kept coming and going for a few hours, all buying drinks as we stood near the bar. About every 5 minutes one of the waiters would start harassing us because someone had either set a drink or laid a coat on one of the unoccupied tables or its chairs next to the bar.  He kept saying he needed those tables for people that may come in for food.  There's about 10 tables. Two had people at them. He never came close to needing the table.  Yet he harassed us for the 2 hours we were there."}
{"text":"Just way too loud for any kind of enjoyable experience.  Not the type of loud in which everyone is having a super fun time, just loud because of bad acoustics.  I'm really not into yelling at my dinner partners or the server and vise versa.  

The noise level tainted any other experience of food or service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped at Redbeards during Light Up Night.  At first glance, drink prices are high.  $5 Sam Adams was the special.  My girlfriend ordered a half rack of ribs and I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken.  When I received my chicken and cut into it, I was able to pull the breading off the entire chicken.  I took my first bite and the chicken was rubber.  My dinner came with baked beans and cole slaw.  The baked beans were as if they had been sitting there cooking all day.  Beyond dry, and well past the point of being sold to anyone.  

My girlfriends ribs were burnt, and the ones that weren't burnt had a fat cap that had not been properly cooked away so they were very chewy.  She had 2 ribs and a few french fries.  I ate two bites of cole slaw and a bite of my chicken and beans.  We notified the bartender that the food was not good at all and we would just like it taken off the bill, as we would just go somewhere else to eat.

The bartender called the manager and told him the situation.  The bartender came back over and said that they took 50% off of the bill.  I had a beer, my girlfriend had a glass of wine, I had a bite of chicken, and she had 2 ribs - our remaining bill was $32.  I found another bartender and had them bring the manager over.  The manager told me that he took care of our bill by taking half of it off since we \"ate half of the food, and that the ribs were fall off the bone tender, and my chicken was properly cooked.\"  I again told him the chicken was not properly cooked, it had a horrible consistency, and my girlfriends ribs were either burnt or encased in chewy fat, and I wasn't paying for any of the food but would pay for our drinks.\"

The manager took the food off our check, we paid for our drinks and left.  I won't be back with some of the other better options around Redbeards."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been to a show at the Benedum. We didn't get to eat before hand so we were starving afterward. We hopped in to this place and asked if their kitchen was still open. We were seated quickly and given menus. There was SO much to choose from. We ordered some wings and a wrap. 
The wings were goosed in a \"sweet chili\" sauce. I thought they would have a little bit of kick to them but they were very good. The wings were crispy and juicy. 
The wrap had turkey, bacon, cheddar cheese, and tomato with mayo. It was filled with turkey. It was very tasty. It came with a side of seasoned steak fries. They could have been abut crisper but they had great flavor. 
I would definitely go back and try other menu items. They had great food and great service."}
{"text":"Eh. This place is definitely not a destination for me when I go downtown and we only stop in when ... actually, I have no clue why we stop in. Maybe because we don't do Olive or Twist anymore?

Anyway, the beer selection is ok, the bartenders I had last time were awesome, and the decor is odd. It's so sparse, I feel like something's missing. Like, the walls need \"something.\" It's hard to explain.

I have not eaten here and don't really have a desire to so I'll leave food reviews for others. I guess if everywhere else is packed, try here?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick drink before a show.  The hostess was very nice and the place was kind of empty, so I was able to get a seat at the bar.  The bar was nice and clean and seated a decent amount.  They have a lot of beers on tap, a lot !!
I got my standard Gin Martini, which was very good and under $10.00.  Not bad for a place in the Theater District.  
Not sure how the service would be if the place was hopping but for me, on a Sunday afternoon, I sat down and had a drink in less than 3 minutes.  
The wait staff and bartenders were 20 somethings so I was privy to the trials and tribulations of a 20 somethings life, but... I found it amusing... kind of took me back to my 20's, well as far back as I can remember.  
I would go back again.  It was cozy and clean and they made a good drink."}
{"text":"I stopped into Redbeards for a few beers before dinner recently. I was overwhelmed with how great this place is!  They had excellent beer specials and extremely classy decor.  I'd like to give a special shout out to Kourtney, Who took care of everything I needed. Everything.  They have quite a few TVs, I think this place would be great to watch games at on the weekends.  Overall: great place to have a few!"}
{"text":"It's a nice hole-in-the-wall bar with a pretty good food selection. The happy hour prices are good, but only include a handful of ales (and I did not know that the beers I ordered were not on the happy hour list - my bad). The food is good, not great - typical bar food."}
{"text":"Redbeard's was definitely a great place to watch some March Madness basketball on big screen TVs and have good food at the same time. I had the tee time burger, which had a beef patty excellently paired with a fried egg. The waffle sweet potato fries were pretty tasty, and the server also was very attentive towards me. Overall, the experience was good, but there wasn't a uniquely different vibe that set this sports bar apart from many other good sports bars."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, service was slow. Many tables that came in after us received their food and finished before we even got ours. Food was good, prices were decent, just wish the service was better. Might go back but there a many choices to choose from in the area."}
{"text":"Was headed somewhere else but saw this place so decided to give it a try. Friendly bartenders. Small but had a long bar along one wall and a row of tables against other wall. 6 Tv's behind bar. After reading some of the food reviews decided to just drink a beer and head to my original destination."}
{"text":"Tried Redbeards today for the first time. The place was pretty busy but I was able find a seat at the bar. The bartender seemed friendly and energetic when he greater me. I was happy to learn that they serve raspberry ice tea and decided on the Ballpark Burger with a side salad after reviewing the menu. 

While waiting for my burger I took in the atmosphere. Six TVs lined the walls behind the bar; all on mute playing sports stations or TNT. The walls adorn Pittsburgh sports art. Contrasting that was the dim, almost too dim, lighting. It's hard to tell whether they're going for a sports bar or contemporary romantic feel. Of course I notice how well stocked the bar was and what a nice selection of craft beers that they have on tap. 

Oddly enough, my burger came out before the salad. No real issue for me but I think it does reflect a small hiccup in the kitchen. This was easily forgiven though by the quality of burger that was served. It was dense and juicy without making the bun all soggy. The bacon on it was thick and chewy, not that cheap, thin stuff that some places try pass off to cut cost with. The burger was topped with provolone cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato and pickle. Well worth the $11.00 they charge for it. 

The salad that I had afterwards was mostly lettuce with two slices of cucumber, two slices of onion, two cherry tomatoes and two pepperoncini's. In the corner of the dish there was some sliced up black olives... I had to wonder that if you were to put the slices of olives back together, would they combine to make of two whole olives? The southwest dressing that I got with it had a nice zest to it and everything on the salad was super fresh.

Despite some of its idiosyncrasies, Redbeards gets a big thumbs up from me. I felt I got a good value for the meal that I enjoyed and I wouldn't hesitate to suggesting it as a meeting place for the next ball game or show that I go to in the Cultural District."}
{"text":"I accidentally got a yuengling after our appetizer. I just want to leave here as soon as possible. I do not enjoy club music at 6pm with dinner. Esp when the sugar bowl is on... Put the football sound on!! You're a sports bar!!! 2 stars for the pierogis BC they were good. Our bill came to 27$ and we came here for happy hour. Tho they forgot to give us happy hour prices. The waiter did fix it.. To then not give us the drink specials. Our bill was 9$ over what it was suppose to be. Staff was clueless. Atmosphere is weird, like they can't figure out if they want to be a Buffalo Wild Wings/ a dance bar with quick bites/ downtown tailgate bar."}
{"text":"Great stop before attending the symphony this evening. The Little Man wanted to go someplace different for our customary before music meal, and he picked Redbeards. We were seated quickly, and when I explained to the server we had a concert to stt st nd in about an hour, he quickly took our drink and meal orders. The lad decided on the blackened salmon over rice with green beans, and I went with their hot pepper plate.
Great selections both. The boy really enjoyed his seasoned spicey dish, even insisting I try a bite. Wow - terrific! My peppers were hot and great, served with some delicious tomato pasta twists and garlic toast. It was all out in z jiff, but with nice presentation...and delicious all!
A quick and very reasonable bill (gee...that's all?) and we were at the hall for some excellent Beethoven with time to spare.
Well done...great service, great food, and at a reasonable price. It helped make for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying Ryan and Dylan (my two bartenders) are probably the nicest guys ever.  They were super nice and friendly.  So easy to talk to.  I felt like I've know them forever.   They made me laugh and were super attentive.  This bar is so nice to go to to just have a relaxing conversation.  I will come to this place time and time again.   If I could give it more stars I would."}
{"text":"Well I stand at the hostess station while she is busy talking. The manager comes up and asked if I want to sit somewhere....well yeah....I want lunch. The waitress comes over and I order....she returns with a flat soda....not a great start. 

No check to see if I want refills, but the wings were ok. I think I shall pass on additional trips.  12 bucks was a bit much for six wings and a drink."}
{"text":"It was a Friday night, so a lot of the restaurants we tried had long wait times but we were seated right away at Redbeard's. We ordered the salmon croquettes and pretzel sticks for appetizers. The salmon croquettes were dry and were really lacking in flavor, so I could only eat it after spreading the queso sauce on top that we got with our pretzel sticks to make them more bearable. That was the first croquette. The second one tasted weird, like a chicken nugget. The pretzel sticks were warm and the queso dip was a good choice to go along with it. I wish they didn't have as much salt on them though. I ordered the Early Tee Time burger, which comes topped with a fried egg, crispy bacon, American cheese, and mayo and a side of steak fries. It was a pretty average burger; I've had much better burgers with egg and bacon. Friends ordered the fish & chips and the garden salad and both more or less enjoyed them.

{"text":"Anyplace that has pierogies on the menu and brings me Mrs. T's frozen pierogies deserves a two star or less rating.  As someone who makes pierogies from scratch paying homage to my heritage, to say I was disappointed is an understatement.  I understand taking some short cuts here and there but I have a hard time believing in a city known for pierogies that some better local options aren't available.  

Other than that, the service was fine, we had a larger group and our waiter kept up pretty well and was very friendly.  Drinks and the rest of our food was okay but nothing to write home about.  If you want standard bar food and aren't fussy about sourcing or who makes it then here's your spot."}
{"text":"Dined here Saturday 8/6 for an early dinner. 
The wings were top notch. I got them plain, but asked for three sauces on the side: redbeard's signature sauce, jalapeño and cheese sauce, and a Horsey sauce that was the surprisingly best sauce.

Our server Cindy was perfect. She recommended the Horsey sauce and although I was skeptical about it at first, I was glad to have tried it. 

I also got an order of the nachos (pulled pork). While decent, the chips were salty AF. 

There is no question that I will return for more wings next time I need to eat downtown."}
{"text":"$7 for an IPA on tap. $6.50 for a cider. $4 for flavorless tortilla chips, salsa that wasn't much more than tomatoes and onion, and queso that was an unidentifiable mix of cheese and whatever else was lying around. $20 for bland \"nachos\" and expensive drinks...we will never go back. Awful!"}
{"text":"Came here after a Pirates game for a bite to eat and drink. Walked in, found an empty table by the bar, only to have a hostess come up 15 seconds later and place a reserved sign on it. Asked if there are more tables, were directed upstair. Found a few empty tables, took a corner circle 5 top. Sat down, same hostess comes up and asks how many people are in my party. I say 4, and she asks us to move tables again. Finally sat down and the hostess proceeds to place \"Reserved\" signs on 6 other open tables around us. An hour and 15 minutes later, they just removed all the reserved signs. Does this business not want customers? Putting reserved signs on all of your tables when Pirates games get out so you don't have to serve customers ? Awesome."}
{"text":"The bartender wasn't very friendly. Actually, just asked for my check and threw it at me! Classy."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way back to our hotel after a really crappy Steeler game and a big loss at the casino. Plus it was raining and humid. 

Waitress was awesome, very friendly and attentive. We ordered nachos with grilled chicken and stuffed banana peppers (weird combo, I know). They were both very good, the ingredients were very fresh!

I would definately go back, nice little bar."}
{"text":"Had a nice time. Food was very good and Nick the Bartender was always there to replenish my Coors Light when I ran out. It was nice and cool inside the bar and my Dad and I enjoyed are time there. Give it a shot you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"I went into this local pub close to the hotel I was staying and it is a pretty good Sports Bar. They have some good beers on tap and had a fairly decent menu. 

I thought the atmosphere was good and upbeat. The service was very good and it seems like a pretty good local hangout. The prices are resonable and that is why I have been back since my first visit.

I bet on gameday this place is crazy since it is just across the river from PNC Park"}
{"text":"We wanted to go to this bar on a Sunday before the kevin hart show. We made reservations a week before for 5 people. When we got there they had no idea where to put us. They said the upstairs was closed... But then asked if we wanted to go up there? We got upstairs and we were the only people in the room. We went at 3 to watch the game and it wasn't on one of the tvs with sound! They were watching ice skating. IT WAS THE LAST TWO GAMES BEFORE THE SUPERBOWL! We went there because it was supposed to be a sports grill. Once situated, we realized the vent above our table was blowing freezing cold air. We asked the bartender at least 3 times to please fix it. The waitress was horrible. Very poor service! Couldn't believe how long it took her to serve us when we were the only people in the restaurant. She brought us waters and then came back and asked if we needed waters? Literally within 10 minutes.  Two of us didn't even drink our waters yet. Our alcoholic drinks took forever. The food was cold and not worth it at all. We had more people join us and we barely saw a waitress. When she did come over she would walk past the table and not say a word.  WE NEVER EVEN RECEIVED HER NAME! She never once smiled. We complained to the manager and he told us they never realized they would be so busy? But for the first three hours, there was only us and two other tables? Her service was poor the entire time. We finally decided to leave... Our waitress put totally wrong drinks on our bill. Then we walked outside and were FOLLOWED BY THE MANAGER AND SERVER. YELLING AT US THAT WE DIDNT PAY ONE OF OUR BILLS! Totally embaressing. We all paid our bills and would never leave without paying. No matter how bad it was. The guy we were with, went to the bar to pay his bill. When they walked back into the restaurant to confirm that he paid the bartender said she never swiped his card!!! Like what the hell? Why would you take someones card.... Hand it back and never do the transaction? We will NEVER go here again. Totally ridiculous. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my boyfriend, since we both work downtown and like to try different places on our lunch hour. The food was ok. I received a different flatbread than the one i ordered. The one I got was fine, and, good thing, because I didn't have time to wait for another to be cooked for me. When I told the waitress (which I HATE HATE HATE complaining about stuff like this anyway, this is what years of working in food service does to a person), but when I told her, she didn't apologize or anything, she just sort of stared at me. And I still got charged for the item. I thought courtesy would at least mean you get your incorrect item half of, at the very least. That's what a lot of other places do anyway. 
Just sort of a ho-hum place. Boyfriend ordered a turkey sammy on ciabata bread, and it was nearly all bread. He complained about it being very bland and the turkey not having any flavor. 
For $25 for two people, we could have eaten at Six Penn, Cafe Amante... both of which have better service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Another downtown place within the Cultural District that's just meh to me. It's kinda more like a sports bar, sort of. Just always a weird crowd the handful of times I've popped in before or after a show. Just like others in the area it's more for suburbanites and yinzers. The food is ok. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Food was cold at all stages of the meal. Dip Trio and pretzel dogs (recommended by the server) were obviously microwaved, and not microwaved well. Stuffed peppers were out of a can, undercooked, and cold in the center.

Nice selection of draft beers. 

Server (very cheery!) told us to order appetizers before the end of the hockey game for a couple dollars off each, so we did!

I gave the server a credit card at the end of the meal. She brought me the receipt to sign, but not an itemized...so I asked her for one.

Sure enough, the appetizers weren't discounted. If she had brought me an itemized receipt and we'd noticed the mistake, I would have forgiven it, but the fact that she didn't AND there was the pricing difference made me feel like we were just getting ripped off, which is inexcusable."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we've gone here and had a bad experience.  The first time, my husband got the fajitas.  They came out cold, gave him two small slices of pepper, and barely a chicken breast.  He asked to talk to the manager and she gave him ridiculous attitude for complaining ( he never complains at restaurants) and was unapologetic.  We decided to give it another try.  For the Pirate home opener they said the \"special\" was a $5 Miller lite draft with a pirate cup.  We were still charged $5 for the special despite the restaurant not having the Pirate cup.  We asked about it (our waiter didn't even tell us) and he said \"it's been 2 months and they haven't come in yet\".  We then got our bill and were charged full price.  I would think again when going to this bar.  They have high prices for less than quality food and they have false advertising on their so-called \"drink specials\"."}
{"text":"Loud as hell... Didn't bother me until someone else mentioned it. But I can't even speak to the server or the person I'm with without having to raise my voice. It's not the music just voices. Lol
Went in on a Friday for happy hour. Super busy took a while to be seen and to get our drinks. When food came it was a little cold. Didn't really have a horrible experience but not the greatest. Happy hour prices aren't really that happy. The girl who was training to be server was very nice and polite, she'll do just fine!"}
{"text":"After tromping the grounds of Downtown Pittsburgh (including Market Square, Point State Park featuring Fort Pitt, and a search for the Riverboat Tour) on a remarkably humid Tuesday morning, we looked along Penn Avenue for something to eat. After passing an endless array of fast food joints and businessman-only haunts, we came across Redbeard's, which seemed to target us a bit better. Two words on the menu indicated to me we had made the right decision: Italian Quesadilla, which was as good and interesting as it sounds. Wife had a hamburger and fries, and combined with our drinks, found that we really didn't need to eat for the rest of the day, yet at the same time the meal didn't exhaust us."}
{"text":"The waitress wrote down our orders came back and asked me what I wanted again and I still got the wrong food. I had to go to the bar to get a beer because she wasn't coming to the table and she added it to my bill. A couple of us asked for water and never got them and it took about an hour and a half to get our food. I've never experienced such terrible service. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Ryan H.  Was a great server.  The large steak fries are awesome and they make a great burger cooked to perfection.  I didn't love the red beard sauce and that is because I don't like mustard if you love mustard go for it.  I would order without the sauce next time.  Why Ryan was so great we came in after the steelers game place was packed.  He said it would be better to get our whole order at once before the crowd grew and it did.  Saved us a ton of time.  Had a great experience."}
{"text":"This place serves a purpose if your looking for a cheap drink and bar food. They have quite a few draft beers.   The service is good but the atmosphere is pretty mellow and unimpressive.  I would only go back if there were no other bars in the area open."}
{"text":"I wanted to give an update. I had a hold on my card for about $23.27 from when I dined there with my fiancé & his boss with her boyfriend on 5/30/14. Hold remained for over a week. I called & initially spoke to a manager & after a week passed called again but this time I spoke to the general manager. The GM was a really nice man, he was to the point & quick to fix the problem. The hold was removed shortly after we spoke.
I can that the GM was not only polite but very apologic & was very quick to fix the problem. 

My fiancé & I enjoy this place & was really glad that they took care of the issue efficiently/effectively. We'll be back again soon. 
*Beware of those tasty moscow mules! lol*"}
{"text":"Madison was beyond great. She delivered grand service and offered great menu advice. I love her positive attitude, which was definitely hard to come by in past Redbeards experiences. Cheers!"}
