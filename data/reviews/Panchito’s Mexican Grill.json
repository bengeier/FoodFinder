{"text":"Great fresh Mexican food,  with a homey feel.  This place is worth seeking out,  as it's tucked away in a motel."}
{"text":"THE ONLY reason they didn't get 5 stars is because no one speaks english. Therefore if they charge you for an item you didn't get--tough cookies, you're paying for it!!  But, I cannot tell a lie. BEST Mexican food I have had since moving from San Diego! And that speaks volumes."}
{"text":"I would go here with my coworkers once a week for lunch because the food is great, quick service, and at great prices.   I usually have a small appetite for lunch so my go-to-order was the taco loco (one taco with rice, refried beans, beef or chicken, lettuce, cheese and topped off with guacamole) which was only around $4 and it filled me up! They also give out nachos in the beginning with a choice of sauces. The chimichanga is also delicious, and I usually always have leftovers when I order that.   This place is different from other Mexican restaurants in that they don't overdue it on the spices, every ingredient is fresh and simple and when it's all blended/put together it's a melody of awesomeness."}
{"text":"My go to Mexican place. Food is fresh and homemade and delicious. Salsa and Queso are always great and the chips are made fresh. There are always a lot of people there but the service is fast and friendly. Very friendly actually. Great folks and great food. For about 10 bucks you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Hole in wall Mexican - standard starters is chips, green salsa, red salsa, and queso. Margarita special was Delish! I usually get chicken enchilada with rice and bean - always satisfying. They have secret homemade hot sauce if you ask for it."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! I never write reviews but this place is worth the effort. The salsa was amazing and I didn't even eat the other three types that came with the meal. Great service! Inexpensive! Great staff! Clearance clean! Everything was fresh! You have to try this!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the facility clean. The waiter was rude.  Bad customer service ruined the whole trip.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Not good in my opinion. Sure, it is plentiful and cheap, but that is not really my first priority with food.   Went for lunch with a few friends and two of us ordered the barbacoa burrito. It was gross. Not only did it not taste anything like barbacoa, but just looking at the meat was gag inducing. It was gray and gelatinous. Not good at all.   Our waitress was very nice but also very incompetent. She brought out the chips and salsas, which are served in small carafes, but brought no bowls. She had trouble taking the order, she didn't check on us, never informed us that the checks go to the desk and you pay there - she just wasn't great.   Additionally, and everyone has their opinions, but I find the location to be pretty shifty. There are people in and near that hotel that don't seem on the up and up!  Park at your own risk!"}
{"text":"If you're a chips and salsa with margaritas girl, then this is the place for you.  They bring out several kinds of salsa plus queso when you first sit down.  Their food is okay.  But I love the variety of salsas and dips you get right off the bat."}
{"text":"Excellent little out of the way Mexican restaurant. It is inside the Clarion hotel but has outside access. Portions are large, salsa & queso are served for free. You can even mix your own salsa b/c they bring you a small bowl of pico to mix in. The meal was excellent and the place was nice and clean."}
{"text":"Looking for food while we were working around the area.  This is a Mexican restaurant inside Clarion Hotel.  The lunch is just around $10 with a soda or coffee, very affordable.  Dinner or regular dishes are more regular price.  The restaurant is nice and the food is not bad."}
{"text":"Very different pulling up to a hotel and knowing that this restaurant is here. When you walk inside the friendly staff greets you and gets you seated right away. It is a decent size restaurant with lots of tables inside. You get chips and 3 different kinds of salsa and they also give you a free dish of queso. Our second batch of chips came out fresh and hot. But seconds cost you a couple dollars. I'm from California it's hard to find good authentic Mexican  restaurants out here and this is by far the best I've had. Doesn't completely meet the whole home standards of Mexican food just didn't have that great great authentic taste but it's the best I've had out here. The tortas are HUGE. The waitress brought out my girlfriends plate and we had to ask if she got the order right. I had never seen a torta as big as the one we received. I ordered the chicken chimichanga and it was very delicious. A friend ordered the carna asada quiesdilla and that thing was huge as well.  The horchata was also very delicious. Very good prices and you get leftovers because the portion are so big. I took half my chimichanga home. For a carna asada torta and a chicken chimichanga and a big to go cup of horchata it was 15 dollars."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is a hotel restaurant that is amazing! The authentic food was amazing. Best tacos we've ever had. Drink specials were pretty great too."}
{"text":"This restaurant was right next to my hotel in Fort Mill, SC. I came in on a Tuesday, which happened to be $1 taco day! Seriously, some of the best Al pastor and barbacoa tacos I've ever had! Plus, the salsas that are served with the complimentary chips are sooo good- bright and flavorful. Had coffee and molten chocolate cake for dessert. I'll be frequenting here often when I come to SC for business."}
{"text":"They use deli chicken instead of real chicken. I could not stand processed chicken,even KFC has better quality chicken than this place. \"Chicken\" taste like rubber. The servers were not nice at all. Food takes a while also, the tomato salsa is basically like marinara sauce.  The avocado salsa is good and spicy though but everything else about this place just not worth coming back."}
{"text":"We finally found a great Mexican place in our area! After moving from Southern California, it's been tough to find a spot that measured up. This place has excellent salsa and guacamole, fresh chips, and flavorful fajitas. We were a bit concerned with it being part of the hotel, but definitely not disappointed in the meal and great service."}
{"text":"Had a stopover at Best Western next door. Not much to choose from in walking distance. Saw this place and was very skeptical about eating here. As everyone has said the outside does not make a good appearance but the food was wonderful.  Large portions and great prices. Was not real spicy, you could actually taste the food. Loved it."}
{"text":"Very good hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant. Great service, very friendly. And the beef tongue tacos were actually very good, and super tender."}
{"text":"If u're looking for Mexican, come here. If u're looking for great Mexican food, don't. The bright spot of the place is they greet ur table with a variety of salsa & quest dip. Everything else is down hill from there except the price."}
{"text":"We just left here. It was great! Excellent service, food, and prices.  We split the enchilada suizas, and the salsas were great."}
{"text":"This place is a tad more expensive compared to your typical Mexican restaurant, but it is worth it. They do not shove you into a seat and out the door like most Mexican restaurants do. We had great service. They really took the time to make sure we had everything we needed. All of the staff members were extremely friendly. The food was AWESOME. They give you chips, salsa, and a green dip (cilantro salsa) when you first sit down which tasted great. I ordered the La Unica Burrito without the red sauce, with beef, and a side of rice and beans. It tasted great. Rice was probably the best rice I have had at a Mexican restaurant. My boyfriend ordered the pollo fundido. He always orders this at every Mexican restuarant. He said he was disappointed that the cheese on it was shredded/melted instead of the cheese dip, so you may want to request the cheese dip instead. Overall a great experience. We sat at the bar and they let us put the game on we wanted to watch and gave us the remote to turn up the volume. I will go back for sure. We stayed at the Best Western and walked right over. Super awesome. We did both order margaritas. There was too much sweet and sour mix for my taste. I am just not a big fan of places that pre-make their mix with the alcohol already in it. They were not super strong, but not super weak either. I think next time I will ask for an extra shot in it though. Try it out."}
{"text":"Wow. What a hidden gem, what great service. We found this place on Yelp and given it's convenient location to my mother-in-law's house, we had to try it. The service was spot on- very friendly and efficient. The food was wonderful as well. What a wonderful surprise to be served not just chips and one salsa but chips, 2 salsas, and cheese sauce complimentary. I had 2 moist, tender lengua tacos, rice and beans. My husband had an asada torte. This was all served very quickly and tasted phenomenal. The prices were affordable. A great meal served with a smile and fast."}
{"text":"Ok. So, I've been back about 5 times since my initial review.    The good: the flautas are very tasty! The tortilla chips maybe the largest I've ever seen and they give plenty.   The bad: they stopped giving the cheese dip gratis. They don't have a license to sell beer on Sunday.  They dropped all beer specials. They seem to have product inventory management issues, almost always out of something.  The service is inconsistent, yet with the same staff?    Altogether, still very decent mex food for Fort Mill, with a few things to overlook but if it's about the food and not a lot more, try the flautas"}
{"text":"Occasionally find these jems in my travels, not a taqueria, a wonderful Mexican retaurante with the most flavorful sauces this side of Mexico."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Mexican food that I've tasted in the Charlotte area. Don't judge a book by its cover, they are the real deal! Food is fresh and authentic and portions are large. Price is very reasonable! Most dishes are under $10."}
{"text":"Took 2 friends with me for dinner here tonight (Sunday 4-6-2014). Everything was as good as it was when I was there last Tuesday. They finally got their credit card machine! Yay! No more having to carry cash!  Dinner was unexpectedly inexpensive tonight! All tacos were $1. The chicken tacos were juicy and well seasoned. Coupled with the free salsas, guacamole, and cheese dip, an unbeatable value!  All 3 of us left full and happy for well under $20 plus tip."}
{"text":"Queso, 3 types of salsa, pico, and a bowl limes arrived on the table as soon as we sat down. For FREE. Free queso? What!! That almost got them an automatic five stars!!!   We orders a ground beef chimichanga and chicken fajitas. The chicken fajitas were delicious and it was a huge serving. We left with a to go box that basically had more food than I even ate.   The chimichanga was only okay, it was filled with rice and I don't really like that, I would rather have just meat than rice filler.   The restaurant is connected to a Clarion hotel and the decorations and furniture just look like hotel lobby furniture- no big deal to me.   I'll definitely be back for the free queso!!"}
{"text":"I was reluctant about a restaurant in a hotel lobby,  but once again yelp led me in the right direction.  Good, authentic food. Only the first basket of chips are free, but they are huge and refills are only $1.25. Both our baskets were fresh and warm. The drink refills were a little lacking but I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 3 times hoping it would be a better experience than the last but it has yet to occur. This time was the last straw for us - we sit down and order a pitcher of top shelf margaritas...but no our waitress tells us that tonight is buy one get one free margaritas which would be cheaper so of course we take her up on that and still request top shelf. About ten minutes later with no drinks, the manager comes over and says \"So you have some questions about the margaritas?\".  We say no and repeat our order and she goes on to inform us that they only have pre-mixed margaritas. Well, that sucked but okay would have been nice if our waitress knew that and told us. So we tell the manager the pre-mixed is fine. About 15 minutes later we still have no drinks, which was odd since they were pre-mixed? I mean people who came in after us and ordered margaritas had gotten them already. So we ask our waitress if they were still coming and she informs is that \"it is not my responsibility\".  Um - you are our waitress, regardless if you can't serve us it is still your responsibility to get us drinks. Another 10 minutes go by and I ask our waitress to please ask her manager (who is responsible for the margaritas?) if our margaritas are coming - she does and the manager goes on to inform us that they were out of this pre-mixed margarita and we're making more (so much for pre-mixed, they might as well have made our top shelf drinks).  So now that we've been there 30 minutes with no drinks, our food comes out while we are still drink less. Mind you, the food is decent here but the staff and drinks are horrible. We do finally get our drinks about 5 minutes after receiving our food (it was also wrong from what we ordered). The margaritas were junk. It tasted like straight mix with no tequila. We are a group of avid drinkers and we left them all pretty much as we got them - full glasses. By the time we are finally ready to go and get our bill - we were charged for 4 margaritas. Um, hello? You told us it was buy one get one free Ms. Waitress. NOPE only if you get a small or something which our waitress never informed us about. We literally took her up on the suggestion of the buy one get one free with no mention of what size we wanted. So after 20 minutes of just trying to get it fixed the manager doesn't even bother coming over but passes along word we can have 10 bucks off. Pitiful service and drinks - I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a staff that knows what they're doing or actually know what their restaurant does and doesn't have or even if you're looking for a semi decent margarita. The food is decent though which is the only reason I can give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"This is the second time we visited, so the first wasn't a fluke.  This place is so good.  They start you with three salsas, all good but the verde is superb, and a little bowl of queso.  We had a barbacoa chipotle burrito and the bistec a la diablo, both delicious.  Last time we had some carnitas tacos, also slamming.  They bring a little sopapilla at the end which is a lovely finish."}
{"text":"I am traumatized now forever...my husband and I have always enjoyed this place but tonight at dinner when I drank my sweet tea I found at bottom of my cup a cockroach. I ran to the bathroom and lost all my dinner, showed the waitress...I had to go up to the manager and ask for my money back..he was sitting at the bar...and he barely even looked at me. This was the most disgusting thing that's ever happened to me.i am mortified"}
{"text":"I have no complaints, walked in and was greeted/seated right away.  Drink specials were very reasonably priced.  I had the Spicy Chicken Cali Burrito which is the #2 special on the Dinner Menu.  Good sized portion of food and the waitress checked on me at least five or six times.  This place is very family friendly also, I highly recommend this establishment to those of you seeking some tasty Mexican Cuisine."}
{"text":"Once again it was really good.  Had fajitas and bf had enchiladas.  Very good.  Salsas were awesome.  Only draw back is servers need more training on the process or sequence of serving.   They are very eager however their methods seem like they could be better.  Just deal with the language barrier.  It is a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but the floor , chairs, and tables were quite dirty. The table and napkins had crumbs and dried food stains. The basket that my nachos came in had some type of dried sauce on the rim. The rice was old tasting and consisted of clumps of older dried rice. But on the brighter note, the sweet tea was great and the Flautas were pretty good."}
{"text":"Despite the reviews, the food was actually good. There wasn't many people there which was a little discouraging initially. You get free queso and three salsas that were very tasty. I had a speedy Gonzales and my husband had the quesadilla Mexicana. Both entrees were delicious! Service was fast. No complaints here, will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Taqueria La Unica is definitely a hidden gem.  Don't let the run down location (connected to the Clarion Hotel) put you off because the food is crazy good here.  I drive past at least 4 other Mexican places to come to this one.  I tend to be a creature of habit at Mexican restaurants and get the same things.  However, I've tried several different things here and it makes me want to try more.  They have terrific authentic tacos here (most of which are only $1 if you come on Tuesday!!).  The carnitas and beef tongue tacos are my favorites.  The carne asada is so well prepared and the bean soup that comes with it is the bees knees!  I've also ordered the shrimp ceviche which was tasty and well seasoned.  I normally don't order taquitos as restaurants because they are bland, but the ones here have fantastically seasoned taco meat with a perfectly crispy tortilla.  While you only get one basket of chips for free, you get three different salsas to snack on while you wait for your food - a mild tomato, a spicy avocado green, and a spicy chipotle tomato salsa.  All of them are tasty and I'd put the spicy sauces at about 6/10 in spiciness (whereas the mild is about 1-2 depending on the day).  I think you can also get a free small queso with your chips upon request (it says so on the menu, but we only got it on our very first visit).  Their margaritas are pretty standard, nothing special.  If you order the $7 one, I've found that it comes out pretty strong if you like one with plenty of tequila.  Overall, this is some of the best Mexican food I've had in Charlotte.  While the hotel and the parking lot are rough-looking, the inside of this place is clean, bright, and not worn down.  There are plenty of tables here.  Service has been great and friendly on every visit so far.  I was hesitant to come here the first time because of the strange and run down location, but it was really such a terrific surprise.  Prices are average (most meals are in the $8-11 range) but the food quality is very good for the price.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  I highly recommend this place, especially for $1 Taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe that this is hidden by and part of the Clarion Hotel.  Best Mexican food, by far(!), that I have had my 4 months in Charlotte/Ft. Mill.  Salsas are incredible and the food is phenomenal.  Love finding a new go-to!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very authentic, and the drinks are reasonably priced and do the job  had such a nice time here. It's attached to a hotel so it doesn't look fancy and intimidating, but the inside is very nice and I think it's underrated"}
{"text":"Another hidden gem! Where is Taqueria La Unica been all my life!!   My husband suggested we come here for lunch, I'll be honest I wasn't thrilled at first. Taqueria La Unica is located in the dingy parking lot of The Clarion Hotel at Carowinds and The Best Western.   The inside of Taqueria La Unica is bright and vibrant. A few tables were occupied around Noon. We received complimentary Queso, Spicy guacamole sauce and salsa! So delish! I can't believe we received all three! Winning! The floors and tables are SUPER clean! Our waitress was great! She recommended quite a few options to us.  My first order of business, Margarita's!!!!! $7 bucks by the way!!! YASSS Please! The menu offers a great selection of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, tortas and much more. My husband and I decided to order tacos. I had four tacos....with no shame! Two Carne Asada's and two Al Pastors. The Al Pastors were my favorite! I LOVE Pork! The smokey flavor was life changing! The Carne Asada's were okay, the steak was a little dry. Each taco was perfectly crafted on a homemade corn tortilla shell. Topped with onions and fresh cilantro. My husband orders three tacos, two Carnita's and one Tripita (AKA Chitterlings). HA! He only ate half of the Tripita.   Overall we had a great experience, I definitely look forward to coming here again soon!"}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff. Food of really good and well priced. They get increasingly busy. If you go on a slow time you are in for a treat. If you try to go at lunch on a Friday, good luck. They will mix orders and will bring appetizers along with the main order."}
{"text":"Delicioso! Their 3 salsas + a queso dip is a delightful start to a meal.Good chips, too! We had quesadillas, both of which were very tasty. Can't wait to go back and try more.Decor looks like...well, the restaurant of a Clarion hotel, but the food rose above that."}
{"text":"Saw a feed on nextdoor.com asking about Mexican places and this one kept being listed so I thought I should give it a try.  We went for lunch on a Wednesday and it wasn't easy to find.  It's on the furthest side from the hotel entrance and doesn't look like much as you avoid huge potholes in the parking lot and ride past a hot water heater laying near the pool... but if you keep going, the food is worth it.  It's far better than Azteca / Don Pedros...  maybe not as good as Charandas in Ft. Mill or Mi Pueblo on Sardis Road, but for the Westinghouse / Carowinds crowd - this is the only place worth talking about!  I highly recommend trying it = inexpensive, fast service, delicious food  :-)"}
{"text":"I do not like to give bad reviews, but thanks to the manager/ owner of this place, here we go... For a Mexican restaurant, they had no way of making a top shelf margarita, no sweet tea, and I waited much too long for the drink I did order. The tacos were less than appetizing, and were very chewy. I understand now why the place was almost empty at dinner time. Upon leaving, my check, to my surprise, was unbelievable. Food cost was $10. 4 shots cost $42!!! I thought there was a mistake, but the manager insisted that shots were-no matter- $10 each. I guess someone has to finance his taste for Tacate, which he openly drank at the bar in front of myself and the sparse amount of customers. I specifically chose the hotel because this restaurant was conveniently located inside. Unfortunately, both the hotel and the restaurant will lose my company's business from tthis day forward due to the fact that the establishment chooses to charge upscale prices for less than mediocre results. The servers were great. I only wish that they worked somewhere as great as they are. Good luck, ladies... 4 tacos. 4 shots. = $42.50 plus tip I won't be back, and would suggest anyone staying at the Clairion at Carowinds to beware. Of you stay here, please do yourself a favor and eat at Culvers or the KFC. You will be very disappointed if you eat at this place!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service in my life, and I work on the service industry, servers taking shoes off and sliding on the floor, 15 min without a drink, branding hair in front of us and we needed drinks just awful"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican place. I had the enchiladas suiza. I picked the chicken and it was juicy, and perfectly seasoned. The guacamole was super fresh and delicious! I appreciated the green salsa that had fresh cilantro and avocado mixed in. Great place and highly recommended. The staff is pleasant and accommodating for other picky eaters at the table. The restaurant was clean and neat."}
{"text":"Picked this place just from Yelp and it worked out great. Don't let the ramshackle outer appearance of this place deter you from stepping inside. The service was fast, the complimentary chips and salsa were fresh and delicious, and the meal was flavorful, fresh, and very tasty.   A good place for authentic Mexican food at reasonable prices and generous portions. Servers have always been nice and helpful. The guacamole is delicious. Keep this in mind and you'll have a great meal here for barely more than you'd pay at fast-food Taco Store."}
{"text":"This is located within a hotel.  Don't let the exterior fool you, this is a great place.  Panchito's Mexican Grill is the old La Unica with a new name.  The interior is the same and the menu and food is the same.  The service is friendly and fast.  The food is better than the other chains in the area.  The only difference from the former name/owners are that I wasn't served cheese dip with the chips and salsa.  I'm not sure what happened, but this name change had me worried until I finished lunch here.  This place is still fantastic.  (It's strange too, I literally ate here a week ago under the old name.)"}
{"text":"Literally the best Mexican food that I've found in the Queen City. We are going to become regulars. Great prices and fantastic service. We wanted for nothing. We especially like the complimentary dessert."}
