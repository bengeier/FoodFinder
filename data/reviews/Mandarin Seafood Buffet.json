{"text":"How can I discribe it? The place never switch the variety around it was always the same. Came here 8 times they never switched the foods around. Food tastes like somebody dumped a bucketful of monsodium glutamate or MSG. Ughh! The only thing you could taste in their food was salt and MSG. The waiter at the front did not notice us until a full 2 minutes passed. That was when we said hello to the guy and he was like what there is people here? Better after renovation but still not good. You should skip it. The waitresses there especially Mindy was very rude and muttered under her breath bad words in Chinese (our family is Chinese that's how we know) to us when we were entering the restaurant. Hello! We are paying you money and this is the attitude you give us! So rude! There was nobody at restaurant when we were there on a Friday evening at 6:30. All signs point to Mandarin Seafood is a horrible buffet. Go to Kumo in Parma for the best Chinese buffet in Cleveland because Mandarin Seafood Buffet sucks! They also did not give us a 10%off when we had the discount card from a local chinese school (CCCCA) when we had it there to show the waitresses. They were like it is a holiday when it is actually the day after Thanksgiving. So rude and unfair we came out of there talking about what they did to us and how disgusting there food is. We came out of there half mad half disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Used be good several years ago but this time food quality and taste was low but the price certainly was not cheap.  We didn't eat much and still have upset stomachs,  Won't be back but I predict the place won't survive it's current form."}
{"text":"Saturday seafood buffet for 15.99 adult, 10 dollars for kids. Dinner consists of sushi, sashimi, crab legs, seaweed, lobster, clams plus other dishes. It is little pricy compare to Kumo in Parma, but again, don't have to drive 30 min."}
{"text":"Nice clean Chinese Buffet. The crab was cooked right. Really nice service. Food was not great but lot of options. Open, clean and nice ambience with lively environment.3.5 stars / 5."}
{"text":"I love a good Chinese buffet, and this is one of the best I have been to. It's your typical Chinese buffet food that you find all over the country, but this is a good one. It is usually crowded, so the food is always hot and fresh, the service good, and the food selection is quite extensive. No mongolian grill here though. If you like Chinese buffet grub, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Shockingly bad. It's shocking because this used to be one of the best chinese buffets around for several years. No longer living in the area, I came back here with a friend for lunch after hearing about the renovation.   A complete turn-around. The actual renovation is not very impressive. but the food took an extreme turn for the worse. Severely limited selection. Overall decline in quality (even for a buffet). several of my favorites were no longer served (butter chicken, chicken skewers, soft-serve). It really is a different place. i guess now they have a hibachi style buffet, where you make a bowl and pick ingredients and they cook it there for you... its does not come close to something like mongolian bbq.   Service was fine, slightly awkward. plates were taken from us literally while we were chewing the last bite. it felt very rushed, but of course the food was the absolute worst.  First time i ever left a buffet where i did not happily stuff myself."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese buffets in the area. The food is almost always hot and fresh and just the fact that they still have crab legs earns it four stars.   You are limited to five crab legs per visit, which is a bummer because they are usually perfectly cooked.  The interior is dated and the bathrooms are sometimes dirty, but these are easily overlooked due to the great food. Don't let the staff seat you near the water fountain.  It's very loud and not conducive to a relaxing meal."}
{"text":"Good fried fatty Chinese goodness.  Bathrooms are immaculate.  Staff is friendly.  Way way way better than golden corral in Macedonia.  They even speak a little English."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion this is the best Chinese buffet around. Don't get me wrong, there is way better Chinese food to be had in the area, but not in a buffet."}
{"text":"Compared to other Chinese buffets, I was not impressed.  The space is clean and modern, but unattractive.  There was less selection here than most Chinese buffets, and I felt like several of the typical dishes were worse than average (salmon was swimming in liquid, chicken and broccoli had very little broccoli, green beans were not as crisp).  Also the lunch price was a couple dollars higher than the places we usually go."}
{"text":"This place has no food.  It was dinner  time WTF. Left over from lunch. Don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Cold dry and tough food for supper.   I did not know it could be this bad.   Worst i ever had in my life.   Some had old soggy flavor.    I will not come back."}
{"text":"This used to be great.  They have started charging if you get more than 5 crab legs.... What is the point of a buffet?    Bathroom was filthy.  Food wad very tired.      Sad...."}
{"text":"Four stars as buffets go better than average quality selection of Chinese food is a little small but they have a nice sushi selection and a Mongolian BBQ deserts were good scoop ice cream and very nice pepperidge farms style cakes a little pricey 13.99 for dinner 1.99 for drink  but worth it for better quality food"}
{"text":"This used to be a great buffet but has gotten really cheap on everything.  The topper was when I got a fly served in my water.I showed the Asian waiter.The waiter took the cup,poured just the top of it off enough to get the fly gone,and refilled the glass with out washing in. I flipped. Never went back. A third world nightmare!"}
{"text":"I would give this zero stars if this option was available. ALL the \"hot\" food was cold.  Didn't try the sushi. Hopefully it was cold. Only one other person in the restaurant on a Friday evening early. Our friends ordered hot tea, and no one came back to see if they needed a refill. They had to go find a server and ask if they could have another cup. The crab legs(which I came for) looked like they were left over from baby crabs, cold, not hot, and only a few small legs available for the whole restaurant. The last time we were here they had crab legs in hot water,  which you had to wait at the serving area to get because they put out so few. Now they put out even fewer, but thy, I assume, are cold as they are not in a steam pan.   The pizza looked like it had been sitting for several hours. My husband said it tasted ok but the crust was like a rock.  He also said that the chicken in the chicken and broccoli was totally inedible.   One thing I had hopes for was the tempura. They had sweet potato, broccoli, and shrimp \"tempura\". I asked a server for some tempura sauce and she looked at me like she didn't know what I was talking about. So she went into the kitchen area and asked and came back to tell me they don't have it. She asked if I would like ketchup. NO!!!  On a positive note, the ice cream was cold (as it should be).   The price for dinner was $13.99 + beverage plus tax. Based on our experience this was $13.99 too much. The service is non-existent and the food quality poor.  We will NOT return.  For a better experience, drive I480 East to Streetsboro to Fun Buffet."}
{"text":"This place is actually very nice! The quality of the food is actually above average for buffet food, so the price (~$16 for dinner) was representative. The variety was what blew my mind. Delightfully surprised the entire night. The service was impeccable and polite. The bathroom sinks, YES, THE BATHROOM SINKS - simply GORGEOUS. A piece of art that is museum-worthy. Come for the bathroom sinks even if you absolutely hate asian food. It will end up making you love asian food. Yeah, dead serious. Better believe it.  Omid. Out. Drops mic."}
{"text":"The service was great, as was the food. I would have given a five star rating but, the selection of food was very limited. But the servers were very kind."}
{"text":"Avoid at all possible costs. And here's the crazy part the food was good so I hate to write that, but have you ever been to a place and feel while you're there that you are being taken advantage of? I went with five other people yesterday for Christmas. We had a reservation for seven and though they didn't close until nine the place was nearly empty except for one larger party than ours. After I tried their sushi which was surprisingly good for a Chinese buffet I went over to the steamed tables only to discover that just about everything was nearly empty and I stood there waiting and hoping things would soon be replenished, but except for a woman bringing out a few more ribs (which were delicious) and some General Tso's chicken nothing else was restocked and I swear the whole time we were there this was pretty much the case. Plus the food that was there like for instance the cheese wontons had been sitting there for so long they were at best warm though the ones I tried were cold. When going to Chinese buffets I know not to expect the world or even close to it, but when you're paying $13.99 I do expect at the very least the food will be kept stocked. Not only wasn't it kept stocked, but I actually witnessed the woman breaking items down and poof that item was no longer offered. Now it is seven o'clock and it is Christmas and people are still coming in and you are seating them so how can you just stop restocking the steam tables? They also have Hibachi, but only one of our party was lucky enough to catch this guy at his station. I waited and waited, even asked our waitress and she was clueless. They just didn't care. Oh and I had read in another Yelp review about how they try and quickly move you out which was odd when like I said the place was basically empty so it wasn't like we were taking up valuable real estate, but literally about forty five minutes to an hour into our meal the waitress came over and set all of our bills down and then kept hovering. Seriously? So you want our money and yet WHERE IS THE FOOD??? I just called to complain and the woman who answered the phone when I asked to speak to a manager had no idea what I was saying. Look there has to be at least one person who understands English otherwise how exactly does this work? Oh wait it doesn't. I will say again the little I was able to actually try was good, but to pay $13.99 and then find yourself scavenging for whatever is left after what they must deem their \"dinner rush\" is unacceptable. The desserts were no better. It was like no one cared. The cakes were either still defrosting or stale and when I asked for a spoon well they weren't stocked either. All the help seemed to want to do was sweep so I guess they could leave, but seven on Christmas or any night when you're not closing until nine is not even close to the time you should start closing down especially when you're still seating people. Avoid! Avoid! Avoid! MAYBE then (though I highly doubt it) they'll get a clue that they cannot treat people like this and stay in business for long. I guess this is why they've gone through several owners, from what I understand, over the past few years."}
{"text":"I go to this place from time to time since it's the only close buffet. The Mandarin never seems to have a good amount of food in the buffet. It takes forever for then to refill.   The food itself is generally good though. Nothing to write home about, but not worth avoiding if in the mood for a buffet."}
{"text":"check the green pepper slices if you try the stir fry station... many still has grocery store PLU label still on them.  we went half an hour before closing on a friday night and had the worst buffet experience ever.  The staff was more concerned with cleaning the floors with a foul dark liquid and glaring at us when we questioned the green peppers that had obviously never been washed.  Regretfully we didn't try the stir fry station until after the first plate of mushy dumplings and terrible rice... we asked for a bill and left quickly... we did not get sick... but it was a roll of the dice... would never go back... who doesn't wash produce???"}
{"text":"Ok, in some ways better than most, but is too expensive. I will scratch this one off my list. We use to come almost every Sunday. It's no wonder the place is empty in the evening."}
{"text":"Sadly, our meal tonight was a terrible disappointment.  None of our party of four had anything positive to say about anything we ate.  In a word, wretched.  I would give zero starts if I could.  I guess it's time to find a new buffet spot."}
{"text":"This is neither \"Mandarin\" nor \"seafood.\"  The buffet is very small.  One third is hibachi, one third sushi/gross sushi roll type things.  One third is dessert/fruit.  There is very little Chinese food, and what was Chinese was not good - cold, bland and boring.  Our waitress was the only high point of our visit.  Two of us ordered hot tea, and all we received was one cup of lukewarm water tasting of dish water.  Do not waste your money."}
{"text":"odd how lunch there can cost as much as a dinner for my wife and two kids at Bahama Breeze!!! Crazy right? I didn't think possible but I looked at the receipts and the Buffet lunch was as much as the Bahama Breeze dinner from Friday night...yikes!!!"}
{"text":"4 stars.  Why? because this is Cleveland. Most buffets suck, especially Asian ones! This one is pretty good.  Do what I do, eat seafood.  Don't eat too much fried crap, eat sushi if it does not look deadly, and lots of crab legs!  You will eat well for like 11 bucks or something like that. Oh yea don't make a habit of eating here or other buffets, gluttony is good only once in a while.  The other food is your typical Chinese buffet, lots of fried crap, mostly Americanized Chinese food items, and typical deserts including the jello and the bananas pudding and vanilla wafer crap that makes little kids fat! So come here hungry and wear your buffet pants."}
{"text":"Big difference of opinion in my family about this place.  To me, it's the low side of average.  My young person likes the sushi (cheap and abundant.)  My SO likes the quantity.  If you are very hungry, have a large capacity for eating, and are not too discerning, this place is a bargain. (For the wallet--it's bad for the waistline.)    The food is standard Chinese buffet, with duck.  There is lots of it.  Most (except sushi) is fried or heavy on oil--fills eaters up more quickly and cheaply.  The ambiance is pretty much dorm cafeteria, with all the clatter and mass-feed indifference you'd expect.    The \"servers\" are intrusive.  In a buffet, it can take time to finish so much food.  I haven't seen the place more than a third full any time I go, but I always feel as if I am being hurried along.  If the plate is still in front of me and not pushed to the side, if I am still eating from it, if I'm not glaring at employees in a chiding why-don't-you-take-this? way, I MUCH prefer not to be asked every few minutes if I am done yet.  I also dislike the employee laying hands on my plate as if to snatch it away before I've even had a chance to reply.    Mostly, the customers are what you would expect--people with young kids or big family groups, people who want to eat a lot (and who might consider not making a habit of that. . .yes, I have found myself among these, so no judgment here), and people not interested in conversation or a leisurely, pleasant dining experience.    Mandarin Seafood Buffet doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is--the Sam's Club of calorie consumption.  If you live in the area and are looking to chow down at a relatively affordable price, this is definitely the place to come.  Don't bring a date or potential client here, and be prepared to defend your buffet pickins' when the employees come around.  (Maybe there are not enough plates?)"}
{"text":"Actually I'd give 3.5 stars. The interior after the renovation is quite lovely. I'd call it minimalist/modern. There is far less seating now, so it appears almost too open. The positive spin on that is that it is much quieter now.  The food I tried was mostly good, but there are less choices since the renovation. They seem to have more cold items (sushi, not sure what the cold stuff is called). There are no traditional steamer trays now. It's pretty, white oblong serving dishes that are set on what appears to be a buffet-length heating plate. Consequently, the food is only warm, not hot.   Two frustrations that are easily remedied--there are no salt/pepper shakers on the table, so you have to ask; there is only a spoon and fork in the table service, so you have to remember to pick up a knife up on the buffet."}
{"text":"Maybe not the best but certainly worth a visit. The sushi was quite good as was the Chinese buffet. They even make sushi rolls upon request, not just the pre-prepared items. Nothing out of the ordinary but a good value too."}
{"text":"Overpriced for normal Chinese fare.  Plan on dropping $80.00+ for normal Chinese food for a party of 4. Crab legs are a joke. There are never any in the holder.  The people that work there circle your table like a hawk.  I would rather order Chinese take out and save $50.00."}
{"text":"The food is very good hopefully when they gain a bigger customer base because they seem new that they keep the food fresh"}
{"text":"This place recently went through a renovation and it looks great. They also added some additional stuff to the menu, there's a sushi bar and Mongolian / stir fry walk up both are great new additions.  Over all for a Chinese buffet I appreciate the selections and price. I generally stay away from buffets because they gross me out the thought that food is just sitting out and people serve themselves etc but this place makes my cut and I would recommend you try it before you knock it."}
{"text":"Look guys, this is Cleveland. Chinese buffets are not our city's speciality.   But if you want some fast, greasy Chinese food (let's be real, we've all been there), Mandarin will be just fine. You'll be seated within minutes and can be stuffing your face with noodles even faster. Sometimes you just crave some Chinese, and Mandarin will be waiting for you.  The space is newly renovated and looks fantastic. Inside, its absolutely huge, so you'll never wait for a seat. This buffet is broken up into a few parts: traditional buffet, sushi and stir-fry. Admittedly, I usually gravitate just to the buffet, where i'm a fan of the green beans, various noodle choices, and buttery crab dishes. On high volume nights, they'll have crab legs, oysters, and various shrimps. The buffet is super clean, and there's definitely this vibe of \"no one is going to judge you for how big your plate is.\" So if you're out with a burly man, let him go nuts and have a Game of Thrones feast. This is also an awesome place to go with a big group-- just call ahead to let them know.   Overall, Mandarin is a totally fine option for a Chinese buffet in the suburbs. You'll be stumped to find a better one!"}
{"text":"I went here for my friend's birthday. All the food looked really good and the selection looked incredible.  They even had all you can eat sushi.  But, to cut a long story short after one small plate I felt extremely sick and spent the rest of the dinner in their nice restrooms. If you could avoid getting sick its a good deal for your money ($13.99 for dinner). Be careful when dining to keep your food where it belongs."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed.  Not only did they raise their price by $4 a person on weekend, but they don't have about 50% of the food they used to have.  It's more seafood than anything else.  The remodel is nice, but I don't like how their buffet is set up now.  They don't have the double sided heating tables like before.  For two of us to eat with 1 drink, $36!!  We won't be going back.  Very sad cause that was my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"What you would expect at a Chinese buffet with slightly above average food quality.  I have my favorite Asian buffet that I usually go to, but one of my friends insisted that I give this place a try.  Variety is okay.  You have the typical Chinese buffet staples (General Tso's chicken, lo mein, fried rice, etc), but there were a few atypical items that I appreciated.  One was the roasted duck, which you don't always find in Chinese buffets.  The duck was reasonably moist and tender.  Another unique dish I liked was the calamari, which was served in big pieces, not the typical tiny pieces that you usually find in buffets.  The third was the Chinese vegetable dish which was mislabeled as string beans.  Most Chinese buffets put way too much oil into their vegetables.  The dish here had a little more oil than it should, but it wasn't overwhelming.  Positives and negatives for the Mongolian barbecue grill/sushi bar:  The Mongolian BBQ has a good variety of vegetables, but not a lot of sauce choices. The meats, however, were very lean.  In terms of sushi, not a large selection of nigiri.  The few rolls I had, however, were very creative.  Awesome part about the sushi bar - the sushi chef made me a custom item that was not offered in the buffet that night.  My go-to Cleveland Chinese buffet is still my favorite, but if my friends ask me to come here again, I'm in."}
{"text":"Food was awful. Crunchy rice. Tap water. Bad service. Told by server there was no egg foo young because it was lunch. Yet we were charged dinner prices. Had to wave the sever down to get refills."}
{"text":"i haven't been there in about a year and a half cause i moved to the west side........i seriously miss this place, the sushi was AMAZING AND FRESH!!!!! which is why i even go to china buffets period. I have yet to find a decent buffet in the cleveland/west side suburbs that matched the quality of this place. I went to a few buffets in lorain ohio and was disgusted and walked out hungry......man i miss this place."}
{"text":"My family used to come to Mandarin Buffet on a regular basis. It had been a while & since we were in the area, we chose to dine here again. The selection was terrible! I should have known better than to take sushi off the serving tray when it's been sitting out with no refrigeration. About 20 minutes after eating it, I was in the bathroom throwing it all up. We told the girl at the front, but she just told us it didn't matter how little I ate, I was going to pay full price. All she worried about was whether or not they had to go clean the bathroom (which they didn't). This place was great once, but I will never go back!! Nobody likes getting sick, but its even worse in a public restroom! My advice, drive a few more miles to Streetsboro & go to Fun Buffet. They don't charge extra for crab legs & the food is fresh!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Endless ceab legs and beer. Beer is a little pricy but tolerable. Good for family gatherings."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go here since we were visiting from out of town. We were greeted by a polite friendly hostess and she sat us down.  The food was typical of a Chinese buffet. They all must order from the same place or something because it was just like the places in the Chicago area. The big difference was the sushi selection which was pretty cool and not bad. They even had oysters. The atmosphere was good. It was quiet.   All in all I would recommend this place. Like I said before I'm not from the area so I really don't know of any other buffets. I enjoyed my time there so feel free to go there and chow down!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and ive been disappointed each time. I decided to write this review so that hopefully no one else will have to spend too much money to be disappointed.  Very limited selection.  You'd think that on Mother's Day the service and selection would be better then usual. For a second Mother's Day in a row i left disappointed.  They claim to have sushi but only have 6 ingredients with which they make it with. Sushi & Habachi staff aren't quite rude but far from friendly. I asked if they could make a cucumber avocado roll with the ingredients they had out for my girlfriend and they said they only make what was already out.  Only two types of sushi were refreshed while i was there for my 90+ min visit and two of the plates were empty the entire time.  Dishes on buffet table sit and aren't refreshed often. Staff pushes remaining food into piles to make it look fresh. Food was greasy and sauces overly thick and salty/sweet, respectively. Food is not labeled properly, orange chicken labeled as general tso's, and no ingredients are listed so good luck if you don't eat meat, pork, or have other dietary restrictions.  I wish the food was as nice as the decor.  Unless you have low expectations and the stomach of a goat id recommend eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"For a Chinese food buffet, this is terrific. The food is excellent with lots of choices. The restaurant is very clean and the wIt staff prompt and courteous. Definitely the best buffet I have found."}
{"text":"For Chinese buffets, this one is good.  Tastey typical fare but usually hot when brought out.  I love going here when they first open, so I can't really comment on dinner service.  I have never had to ask for refills on my drink because they have always been very good at making sure it's full and the staff loves talking with my boys, so my babies are always taken care of.  I can't complain."}
{"text":"A pretty good buffet, worth a visit. went on a Sunday and it wasn't busy at all. The only thing I dislike bout this place was the customer service, it took them forever to notice I was out of drink and they didn't speak well to customer."}
{"text":"When the food is good it is really good, but at times it can be not so good. It is best to arrive early as it can get busy around noon. They don't always refill the different entrees as quickly as they should and if you are in a hurry, that could be a problem. One of the better moderate price Chinese buffets. Recommend"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! Dont eat here, it is really bad! the temp is 90 degrees in here and and its 70 outside. Flys everywhere! The food well had to let my crab legs defrost before I even attempted to eat them. Who serves frozen crab legs! Save your money go somewhere else this place is REALLY  REALLY Bad!!!!"}
