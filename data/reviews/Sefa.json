{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant by accident on a snowy, cold evening - at least by Utah standards.  This restaurant is a hidden jewel.  You can tell that great care is taken in preparing the food.  The server (owner?) there was very kind, and you could tell she was excited to explain the menu and the dishes, and very pleasant overall.  I had the lamb shoulder and it was delicious.  The meat was soft and tender.  I also had some kind of rose water flowery drink.  That was delicious as well.  I thought that the portions might be small upon receiving the dish, but it turned out to be plenty.  

The ambiance was nice as well.  Although I was just having a business dinner, this would be nice for a romantic date.  Clean and well decorated.  The service is a step up from most fancy places, in my opinion.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Food & presentation-wise... I mean you can tell the owners/chefs TRIED to present the food, tables & overall ambiance of  the restaurant in a classy manner, however they did not succeed in doing so...

The food is \"meh\" (I really cannot think of a better word). Overpriced, overcooked and I found the portions to be rather small. The portion size wouldn't have mattered if I was experiencing quality food which, I was not. I liked their yogurt - but that's about it. The meat was so overcooked that it was gummy, I felt like I was chewing for hours!  

The restaurant itself is small (not crammed though), so although it has the potential to be an intimate sport, the strange air of the restaurant removes that potential altogether..."}
{"text":"Mais qu'est-il arrivé à cet endroit ? La qualité du service et de la nourriture laisse à désirer. Avec ma gang on a été moyennement convaincu. Serveuse inexpérimenté qui n'a pas su nous expliquer les plats. Agneau sec et tiède, mon \"mutancana\" était fade, soupe très salé, le vin moyen, on est pas resté pour le café et le dessert et ça nous a coûté cher (43$ par tête). Dommage..."}
{"text":"Fabulous turkish food in a high quality decor.
A great discovery, will go back!
Facing Renaud-Bray on Du Parc, north of Laurier.
Excellent value, must-try!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and tasty food (we had the coban salatasi, taze fasuliya, and the adana kebap). The presentation was great and so was the service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hesitated between a 3 and a 4 for this one. It definitely wasn't bad and I really like the menu. However, while the cook seemed skilled and well in control of his dishes, there's a huge lack of spice in every plate. The meat is cooked perfectly, its well presented and yet it's bland. We asked for 'something to spice it up' and they brought us yogurt... not exactly spicy! I'd like to come back but I'd be very tempted to bring along some salt, pepper and sumac! 

I enjoyed the mezzes and the mantis. Wanted to try the main course of eggplant, but it wasn't available due to the chef not finding any suitable eggplants at the market that day! I like the honesty of sharing that info and his decision making. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Our concerns when we walked into Sefa at 8 pm on a Saturday night to find only one table occupied were unfounded. This was a delicious meal. 

The wine list is Turkish wines, which I appreciated as much more interesting than the usual French/Italian/Californian selection. Unfortunately, there had been a delivery problem with the SAQ, but they had the Shiraz and it was excellent. A lot more depth and richness than you usually get with a Shiraz and a nice touch of smoke from the cask. 

The restaurant started us off with a complimentary appetizer of smoky roasted eggplant mixed with yogurt and garlic topped with fresh dill with warm soft rolls to dip.  The dip was perfectly balanced, especially with the fresh dill. 

We ordered boregi to start. It was described as a feta cheese pastry, but the cheese was a mild semi-soft sliced cheese. This was the only thing that was not perfect about the meal as it had not been heated enough to fully melt the cheese. Whatever, you really can't go wrong with cheese, pastry, and butter, and it was definitely tasty. 

For my entree I ordered the cold mezze sampler. Everything on the plate was fantastic, and I could have eaten a whole plate of all if it. The hummus was quite good, not unusual or remarkable. The smoky eggplant (which had been blended into yogurt for the dip) was topped with a drizzle of pomegranate molasses that added the perfect sweet and acid note for the silky purée. The stewed green beans were perfectly balanced with the tomatoes. And the spinach was the sleeper hit, heavy with mint and chewy-tender barley and topped with a dollop of divine thick yogurt.  

My husband had the lamb kebab, which came on a bed of flavored rice and served with a simple but delicious cabbage salad. 

The space is very nice, on the elegant side rather than aiming for hip. The service was attentive and solicitous but not overbearing. 

The price was reasonable for Montreal, about $70 for the food and one glass of wine each."}
{"text":"\"A flavor trip to Ottoman Cuisine.\"

Definitely will be one of my favorite spot in Montreal area. Lovely & authentic atmosphere, elegant, classy, chic with wonderful service, a delicious menu specially Hunkar begendi (Sultan's delight), yogurt soap, lamb tandoori and cold & flavorful appetizers. Rice pudding is just as great as I have been tried in Istanbul before like a home made taste. Tired of fast foods and unlimited numbers of French & North American restaurants, or just want to do sth else really \"different and fantastic\", head right here to his cute and orientalist restaurant. Definitely worth to eat in here. Everything was phenomenal !!!"}
{"text":"Not about the food:

The interior of this place is nice, light & clean with a small television playing a black and white movie, and some great Turkish music playing in the background.
The service was lovely, very attentive and friendly, we even learned how to pronounce the ?.
Prices are very reasonable.
The area it's in offers enough parking and after 9 it becomes free (yay).

About the food:

We started sharing the cold mezze taster platter, tasty stuff, all veg so not heavy and very flavourful.
On to the mains.
Since we ordered a coarser Turkish wine our lovely waitress suggested we'd try the lamb dishes, so we did, we each tried one (and shared some with each other too of course), very tender lamb and enjoyable traditional side dishes, a good choice for sure, and don't forget to order some yoghurt with your meal, yoghurt ALL the things!
We were stuffed, though our waitress said she has had some complaints about the portion sizes being too small, they're not, we ate our fill and then some plus it's Turkish food not an all you can eat Hungry Man dinner buffet (some people, jeez...).
We also got to try a little dessert called a?ure, a little fruity/grain mix of pudding and compote topped with almonds, I loved it a lot because I'm one of those people that prefers fruity desserts.
Oh and the yoghurt dip you get with your basket of bread is also amazing, so yes it goes without saying we will be back.

I'm happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"After living in Istanbul for 18 months, I can say that it is not always easy to find good Turkish food. This place is legit. I went with a group of friends, the service is a bit slow but they are super nice and helpful. We shared few appetizers and main dishes. My favorite is the meat stuffed in the melon. It is something unique that you won't find in other places and delicious."}
{"text":"Textures et nouvelles saveurs pour moi! Tout était réussi, des mezze au plat principal jusqu'au délicieux dessert. Bon service et beau décor, bien que la lumière devrait être légèrement tamisée."}
{"text":"Alrighty, so here is my 10 cents about this place. Undoubtedly one of the best Turkish restaurants in North America. Literally, I have tried so many but in terms of authenticity this surpasses them all. Smoked egg plant to perfection, and meat so tender that i tantalized my Taste buds. Service was great too. I highly recommend this place. Will definitely come back!! Cheers"}
{"text":"Finally a spot with good Turkish food with meat. I had a chance to try the lamb dish. It's same as the authentic one. My friends got kebabs, which were also good. I give 5 stars to the main dishes.

Mezzes can be up to the expectations of most people but they were still lacking some authentic taste. Thus I give them 3 stars for that.

Desserts: Their baklavas are quite good, Sutlac (baked rice&milk) is very good, however Asure has nothing to do with the original one. I was very disappointed that they didn't even use pomegranate in that. Don't get that one, you can easily satisfy your sweet tooth with the other two.

Good and chill atmosphere. I'd recommend it for the main courses. It they boost their mezzes I think it may be an indispensable spot in Montreal's food scene."}
{"text":"This really is the best Turkish you will find in  in this area. Excellently authentic food, great service and really nice atmosphere! Would def recommend!"}
