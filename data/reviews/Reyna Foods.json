{"text":"Ay Reyna's!  Where would I be without your taquitos?  This California girl, who hates driving, makes her way all the way to the Strip from Regent Square for the smell and sabor.  Thank you for always making my rice and beans on the veggie side of the grill, squeezing on extra límon, and just being buena gente.  ¡Hasta pronto!  *I'd give another star if the taqueros weren't handling money and food with the same glove-less hands..."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. The mini tacos were surprisingly pretty flavorless and not fresh. The tortillas were chewy/hard? and it was work to get through each taco. my fish tacos were supposed to come wih a creme sauce but there was no sauce and the tacos ended up being very dry because of that. My mans tacos came w rice and beans and lines but mine didn't and it took forever to get those! I'm hoping this was just a fluke but we left feeling bad that we actually paid money for that meal."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh. I mean I'll gladly love to be one-upped but til that day comes, best tacos in Pittsburgh! Tacos lenguas is always my choice. They have a very plush selection of Mexican groceries too. Oh and I'm a sucker for flash, so of course I love that spinning barrel they have up front with the blow torch roasting peppers. It makes the whole block smell wonderful!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie I don't have much experience with street foods. Pittsburgh simply isn't a big city for them (I've heard San Francisco is the best place for Food Trucks). Other then the occasional hot dog vender they are few and far between here. As far as I remember today was my first street food experience and that took place at Reyna's Taco Shack in the Strip District.  I've been told for the past three months by Kandace that they had the best tacos in Pittsburgh here. Being a fan of tacos, and Mexican food in general, I had to judge them for myself. The shack is staffed by a single man armed with two skillets and few ingredients. I ordered a chicken taco and a steak taco to mix it up a bit.   The Chicken Taco:  Kandace might be right. This was easily one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. Tortillas are something that can easily make or break a taco and these ones were excellent. They were obviously homemade and perfectly cooked. The guy manning the shack briefly grilled them on one skillet then transferred them on top of the filling for awhile. It really added to the overall taste of the taco. The chicken was shredded pretty thin which worried me at first because the chance of it being dry was greatly increased. I couldn't have been more wrong. The chicken was extremely moist and juicy. Perfectly cooked. This guy was a master of his craft. Each taco was topped with a good amount of sour cream, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and cilantro (which was a nice touch). They had three different salsa to choose from but I chose to eat mine plain. I'm glad I did. I could easily eat these tacos 2 or 3 times a week.  The Steak Taco:  Basically copy and paste everything I just said above about the chicken tacos. I did have one issue with the steak though. It was cut into tiny cubes which made some (not all) pieces pretty chewy. It wasn't as perfect as the chicken but it was pretty close.  The Rating:  Was it filling?: I had 2 tacos and was pretty full. I could have probably had another 2 but I normally devour tacos  Did I feel gross afterwards?: Not really  Would I go there again?: Yes 100%. I'd like to try a burrito or shrimp taco  Would I order it again?: The chicken yes. I think I'd opt to try something different before I got the steak again"}
{"text":"This place is full of all your packaged goods, I was looking for more authentic fresh foods like produce-chili,  meats and breads. Which they do not have there. Items are very overpriced and it reminds me of a tiny corner store with all the dusty canned goods that no one buys. The taco stand out front is ridiculous. I ordered 2 carnita tacos, and 2 PLAIN bean and cheese burritos and they charged me $20 for that (overpriced again) the burritos were $7 a piece- the lady said \"its because they are big\"...they were not very big. Burritos were super salty and the lady insisted on putting rice in them, which was a super bad idea. Rice was hard and not fully cooked. Then after they made the burritos they put them into the microwave to warm them up. The kids didn't even want to eat them because of the saltiness and hard rice. Long story short NEVER going back there again."}
{"text":"These are seriously the best tacos in Pittsburgh.  Prepare for mind to be blown.  Although they're not really an order ahead kind of place, their little street stand graciously packs everything up whenever our office descends upon them for lunch, tupperware containers in hand for ladling out salsa.  My personal favorite is the lengua taco with guacamole.  I haven't really shopped in the store much since it's kind of out of the way for me, but I'm told the tortillas are top notch, and judging by the tacos, I'm a believer.  All your tacos are belong to us!"}
{"text":"Being from LA, I was disappointed with the tacos. The Carne Asada was bland and didn't think this is authentic Mexican food but another street faire."}
{"text":"2 for 5. Banging tacos!  I really like the serve yourself taco sauces. Almost Every time I'm in the strip district."}
{"text":"I love the taco stand outside of Reyna's. I've tried all of the tacos that they have to offer and wasn't disappointed with any of them. My favorites are the lengua and chorizo, so when I go I usually get one of each.  Their homemade tortillas are also pretty delicious. Warming them up in the oven with a little oil makes them even more delicious.   They have a good selection of things in the actual store, including Salsa Lizano, which I had previously thought I'd have to order from somewhere in Latin America. And they have Guava Jelly, which is always absurdly delicious!   I would definitely go back here, even in the snow. Too good."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Im from LA, so id like to think I know a thing or two about mexican food and I can honestly say this place is a homerun! Great salsa, fresh tortilla chips, friendly owners and staff."}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant only, not the grocery store or the taco stand  If you want authentic Mexican food this is the place to get it in Pittsburgh.  Many people in pittsburgh think, Chiptole or Emilianos are Mexican... they are not those are TEX-MEX places... this is the same food you will find in Mexico and its delicious.  I have had many things here and i have always left happy. The waitstaff is very nice and attentive, from the person who greets you at the door to the waitstaff everyone is always smiling.   The food comes out extremely fast and they have great lunch specials.    They have an outdoor patio, but i always go downstairs, its nice and cozy and doesn't feel like ur in a basement... even though it essentially is.  If you have never been you are missing out, so give it a try."}
{"text":"Try the fish or shrimp tacos. They were amazing! Don't bother having the one with chicken. I thought that was quite bland!"}
{"text":"Just moved out to Pittsburgh from San Diego and I was so shocked to find they serve Carne Asada here. This shop is a life saver when I want to have some authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or if you insist do not order the blend 'Flautas', no taste. The menu states guacamole and refried beans. Instead All three orders on my table came w/o guacamole and a bed of rice. Asking the waiter if there was something missing she said no. When I asked about guacamole she said she COULD bring me some. That's fishy. And the price tag for the dish: $16. So if you are craving Mex go to Edgar Tacos 4 blocks down. You won't regret."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service .. I had to wait for more than an hour to get food .. Iam visiting Pitt and this place was not where I wanted to spend 2-3 hours of my time for food.."}
{"text":"The food is good although I think it used to be better. The customer service at the restaurant isn't all that great. I once had to wait for an hour even though I'd made a reservation. The taco stand is your best bet. I've heard that their homemade tortillas for sale are good, though."}
{"text":"The tacos here are out of control. They are literally like happiness wrapped in a delicious corn shell. All the meats are good, but I recommend the pork and tongue ones most strongly. You can customize these babies any way you want, but the default includes cheese, onions, cilantro, tomato, and a squirt of lime, which I tell you is life-changing. Don't forget to try the sauces, and don't be afraid to ask questions--the chefs are so nice!  When I interned in the Strip District, there would be days that I'd forget to pack a lunch, and even though it wasn't really a question, these tacos were always the answer. There is a reason why there's an ATM right next to this stand.  The Powers that Be want you to have these tacos."}
{"text":"Being originally from Arizona, I know a good taco.  The taco stand outside of Reyna's is GOOD.   The carne asada meat was tender, though I usually prefer a little more char. A friend i was with got the beef tongue, a little too eccentric for my taste, but he loved it.  Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the tortilla.  I am usually tuned off by corn tortillas, but theirs are soft, not dry, and don't fall apart as the taco juices seep in. In other words exactly what you need for a good street taco.  The best part is the taco barrista squeezes fresh lime juice on top of the taco as a finishing touch. It really puts it over the top."}
{"text":"Best tacos outside of Texas. The pre-made guacamole is to die for. The tub marked X-Hot, is actually HOT!!"}
{"text":"As far as Mexican grocery stores in the area, Reyna is one of the best, however with the large cavet that this is based on a Pittsburgh scale (I was reminded all too well of this on a recent trip back to Chicago, when we stopped by Cermak).  I recently stopped by for their street tacos though and was underwhelmed.  Likely because the ones at Las Palmas in Oakland are so good.  The portion size of the tacos was incredibly small for the price, like seriously three bites each for a little over 2 bucks per taco.  I had three and was still quite hungry.  The flavors were pretty good though, but even in the taste category, I'd give the nod to Las Palmas.  It is nice that they have a few outdoor picnic benches to sit at, though these can fill up pretty quick on a busy day."}
{"text":"I adore Reynas!  The selection of hot sauces, the quirky tzotchkes (sp?), the salsa, all are stupendous. But those tortillas...to die for!  Then you have their tacos!  Heaven!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos at the street stand. It's a toss-up between chorizo and chicken tacos being the best. Get them with everything on it."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh. I was just there and tortillas were being made. The guacamole is fresh and delicious. They offer many different sauces to please every palate."}
{"text":"Warning:  If you put one of his tacos on your head, your tongue WILL burrow through your brain to get at it. Not closed either."}
{"text":"I went to the outside little \"truck\" vendor and it was off the chart fabulous. They brought me in with the smell coming off the griddle and the corn tortillas were great, the lamb special was amazing and I got it loaded. I also bought the small container of guacamole which was totally on point for me.  I loved it. They had a small salsa bar and i didn't need it. I just loved this simple, nice and reasonable meal. Was so perfect for a beautiful day walking in the strip district."}
{"text":"Edgar's Taco stand right outside on 21st between Liberty and Penn is fantastic.  The marinated lamb tacos are the best, although the chicken and beef tacos are good too.  The fish on the fish tacos were overpowered by the ingredients, and if you can't taste the protein then it's best to skip the dish altogether.  The guac is really good, and worth the extra $1.  This is definitely the real deal, and they are delicious.  There's almost always a short line -- they seem busy all the time.  The few tables and chairs right next to the stand are mostly in full sun.  These tacos are best enjoyed when they are hot and fresh, immediately off the grille.  Grab them, scarf them down, and move on!  The flavors are great.....  Right next to Thin Man Sandwich shop which is pretty reliable as well!"}
{"text":"I have only occasionally bought groceries here, but oh my god, the taco stand outside is AMAZING. Yeah, the guy doesn't wear gloves and he handles money and food with the same glove-less hands, but frankly, who cares? I haven't been adventurous enough to try the lengua, but I really enjoy the chicken, mostly because it doesn't compete with the awesome flavors of the seasoning (never underestimate the power of salt, pepper, and lime juice) and the cilantro and the salsa and the cheese and ahhhhh;lsiuoietkhdfkljhdlkfhlk. I am starving just thinking about it. Go. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place should either become a taco stand or just shut down. I ordered the mole sampler for $17 and what I got was a slop bucket of mediocre flavors. The rice was completely soaked. The shredded chicken was chewy and overcooked. I wish I had 4 hands to give this place 4 thumbs down. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"The taco stand's lengua (tongue) tacos are freaking amazing. Great tortilla, super tender meat, and great flavor.  Love it."}
{"text":"The chicken fajitas were enough for two and served in a pineapple.  My friend's margarita poured 3 glasses and looked tasty.  Think I would come back here again, but will probably try some other places in the strip district first."}
{"text":"Where to begin, where to begin...  More often than not, I find myself staring at my computer screen thinking about how I am going to blast an esablishment. I don't rave about \"good\" food. I rave about amazing food. The type of food that I have dreams about. The type of food that makes me want to bring about a thousand dollars cash and gorge myself untill I need an ambulance.  The taco stand outside of Reyna Foods makes just that kind of food. Too often when we think of Mexican food, we think of a variety samey tasting, samey textured mixtures of ground beef, yellow cheese, beans, and tomatoes stuffed into a processed flour tortilla covered with a plastic sauce (I'm looking at you Emiliano's). Reyna's doesn't just break the mold, they hurl it at the wall, smash the pieces with a bat and then scatter the dust in a blast furnace. The tacos here are aboslutely amazing. Fresh ingredients cooked right there on an old plancha-style grill that has absorbed the flavors of countless meals and stuffed into fresh corn tortillas are a truly enlightening experience. I mean it.   The first time I went here was to just grab a quick snack while walking around in the Strip district. I saw they offered tongue as a protein choice and thought to myself \"What the hell, in for a dime in for a dollar right?\" Best. Choice. Ever. The first bite was like reaching the Seventh Level of Enlightenment. The Buddha said I could ask one question. After careful consideration I asked, \"Can I have another taco?\" After that I made a vow that I would forever be a loyal raving fan.  The tacos are assembled to your liking. I like mine with the works: the perfectly cooked meat on the warm tortilla then covered with queso fresco, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro, fresh lime juice, and sour cream. The flavors all play well together to strike a classical tune of a Mexican bolero on the pallate. As previously mentioned, I like the tongue. It has a wonderful richness and gameyness to it that I have come to love. My far less adventurous girlfriend stays with the chicken. They have other choices ranging from pork, to steak, to shrimp, to the ever popular ground beef (gotta please everyone I guess).  After you order your tacos, try one of the fresh made flavored waters there. The fresh lime water is always my favorite, and is there every day, but they also have hibiscus, watermelon and other flavor selections. My girlfriend got the horchata, a milk based concoction with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Or you could pop inside the Mexican grocery for a Coke hecho en Mexico. My favorite Coke because they use cane sugar, not HFCS.  The only downside is that they close right around 3:00 PM.  Come to Reyna's. The tacos are amazing. Do I really need to say any more?"}
{"text":"Absolutely delish taco stand out front... Fish, lamb, chicken, beef, carnitas! They serve them fresh off the grill with all the fixin's! They have serval fresh salsa and hot sauces too!   I love the food inside too! Great groceries!"}
{"text":"This review is for the taco stand outside of the store. EAT. THERE. ASAP. My bf and I were in town for the weekend and were exploring The Strip. We originally planned on eating at Deluca's since we'd read that it was the best brunch spot in Pittsburgh. After seeing the line snaking around the block, I flippantly said, \"I'd be fine eating some of those street tacos,\" and my bf quickly jumped at the opportunity to not have to wait in line for over an hour. Boy oh boy were we happy we changed our plans. We each had one carnitas (pork) taco and one chicken taco. They were succulent and amazing. I loved how the tacos had more toppings than the usual street tacos--cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. I especially enjoyed the tomatillo salsa as well. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, Reyna's will be my first stop."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go get some tacos from the day time taco stand at this place!! Best tacos I have had in Pittsburgh!! A great quick bite to have when you're shopping Sat/Sun morning or afternoon in the Strip District! The grocery store is also great, with many varieties of South American food products!!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of a place. Authentic mexican food. One of the best fajitas in the area. Salsa was homemade but lacked robust flavor. Sold $3.00 cokes without refills. The fajitas came in half of a grilled pineapple. Who does that?! Genius! A little pricey. Lunch for 2 without alcohol was $40; out the door for $50 with tip because the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"In town for trade show. This Is a first class authentic Mexican restaurant!! On the scale of Rick Bayless's places in Chicago. Salsa's (tried 4); mole's, enchiladas were super flavorful. I must visit!"}
{"text":"Reyna has the best sit-down Mexican in the city. I really enjoy the margaritas, which as quite generously portioned. I always try one of the fruit flavors, and ask for them \"less sweet.\" The bar staff is always accommodating to my request. The restaurant is pretty new, and the environment is nice. I love the Mexican pine tables and chairs, and the art is always a great conversation starter. The chip and salsa sample lets you try the best of the salsas from Reyna's. I normally go for the Chile Rellenos, but everything I had tried is well cooked, flavorful, and interesting. I have taken many guests here, and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just discovered their taco stand outside a few weeks ago.  WOOHOO!  Like the stuff on the inside, they charge just a bit too much (street tacos should be $2 max, not their $3/2 for $5), but they're excellent.  They even have lengua (tongue - tasty).  I haven't seen that since Buford Highway in Atlanta.  Probably not the best if you're from San Antonio or San Diego, but the best you'll find within 200 miles."}
{"text":"I was so excited to make it to Reyna, their selection is great. However when I brought home and opened one of the spices it had flies in it, another jar of pepper paste was one year expired and a bag of chilli sauce was expired since 2013. Completely unacceptable and disgusting to sell such expired food to your customers. Check the expiration dates on all purchase from here!!!"}
{"text":"This is a top-notch mexican grocery, albeit a small one. They sell corn and flour tortillas made on location that will change your life. They also make a variety of fresh salsas and dips. It also has a good selection of hot sauces and pre-packaged salsas. There is a small selection of produce to and other groceries you need but might not find at regular grocery stores. Overall a must-visit if you're making some Mexican."}
{"text":"We have no real Mexican grocers back home in Connecticut so this place made me giddy.  Huge drums of every kind of dried pepper imaginable.  Pinatas, sombreros and other toys.  Good selection of mexican cheeses.  The homemade corn tortillas were piping hot still.  People were buying the tortilla chips in bulk.  Only downside was the people working there, went out of there way to not be helpful.  Cashier says \"I'll be right with you\" and then says \"How are you today?\" and I say \"Great, thanks..do you have tacos?\" followed by her saying \"I'll be right with you\" again as I stood and watched her fiddle with the register for another 2 minutes."}
{"text":"Best tortillas in Pittsburgh - made in the store! Also a decent taco stand outside."}
{"text":"Reyna's Food saved my life!!!  Ok, not really.  As a recent transplant from Colorado (having been born and raised in New Mexico) I was really homesick for some actual Mexican food, which you can not get at any restaurant out here.    I was so excited when I saw the sign outside that advertised actual Hatch Green Chile (it's chile - not chili, people!).  It was pricey - but that's to be expected.  It was also very tasty.  I was impressed by the wide selection of Latino Foods, and while their tortillas aren't what I'm used to, they are quite good.  I'll be going back again and again!"}
{"text":"Surprised it took me so long to write a review for this place. Something to note: This is a review of their grocery items ONLY. I have never actually had a meal here.  This is my GO-TO Mexican place. I come here for their fresh homemade tortillas- corn & flour. If you come on the weekends, you can grab a bag while they are still WARM. How awesome is that?! I love their house made chips, they are incredible. I also ADORE their house made quesco (it's pricey, but worth it) and their house made salsas. I love Reyna Foods so much and HIGHLY recommend it for anyone who appreciates Mexican cuisine!"}
{"text":"I work across the street, so clearly my love of all things Mexican led me to become a frequent customer at Reyna.  The guacamole is by far the best I've tasted in the city and maybe even all time. You can get a small tub of it with a whole bag of chips for only 8$, which is definitely worth it. Seriously, the guacamole takes Reyna's above all the rest.  The street corner stand is phenomenal (as in every lunch break, this is my stop) and really considerably priced. Nearly everything in the shop is made fresh and the taste is to die for. Pittsburgh needs more taco stands like Reynas. Tops in Mexican food for the city without a doubt, and I feel like I'm well versed in the variety of Mexican throughout the city.  I couldn't leave out the burritos! Huge! Incredibly filling! I'd wait in a line around the corner for Reynas in any weather, no doubt about it. The store itself is filled with all kinds of foods that make Mexican cooking in the comfort of your kitchen easy."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the taco stand on a crisp, sunny December day.  YUM!! I had one solitary fish taco as I was running low on cash. But it was worth it. Put on some of their hottest hot sauce (which hit the spot), sat down at one of the tables and waded through the messiness. Consider me converted... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"loving me some beef tongue tacos.  tasty and refreshing."}
{"text":"I browsed the market itself, which was a bit smaller than i expected. i guess that what the market had were the things that one could find practically nowhere else in pittsburgh in order to make some decent authentic mexican/caribbean dishes. frankly, even though i only visited it a week ago, it was definitely not a very memorable store.  drink selections were lacking with little more than the usual jarritos.  i tried the taco stand outside next: while they said they offered empanadas, it was sunday afternoon around 1PM and the gentleman said that they had run out.  Frankly they take these ready-made empanadas and microwave them before serving them to the customer, so i don't understand why they coudln't have just gotten some more from the huge mound of empanadas i saw in the store just minutes before. but i was too lazy to ask. also, they microwave the empanadas on styrofoam plates....no comment.  the 1 taco for $3/ 2 tacos for $5 was probably the best deal that I could find in pittsburgh for some close to authentic mexican tacos as i coudl find.  They indeed pack your taco with a lot of the fixings, but in doing so, they don't realize that all the juicyness that comes from the meat (especially the lengua) causes the little corn tortilla to rip very easily.  i have not been any other mexican joint that serves these style tacos with only one little corn tortilla: they're always made with two corn tortillas with the presumed purpose of protecting rippage.  one star off for that.  The salsa on the side that was left out that was the perfect consistency of the type of salsa i like (non chunky) was somehow too dry.  this may have been due to lack of freshness.  if only it were fresher, it would have been a nice complement to my tacos. on the upside, they prepare the meat from scratch, putting a little blot of uncooked meat on their grill, while they prepare it in front of your eyes. that was a welcome difference for this joint compared to other taco joints.  all in all, compared to the other place in pittsburgh i've tried for tacos (Mexico City), I'd much rather come here.  closer, cheaper, and tastier. mexico city does not do mexican food justice."}
{"text":"This was our fourth try. We went to the basement resturant and had another disappointing exsperiance.  The chubby female bartender with the side shaves head was very rude. Even though we were at a table and had our own waitress. The bartender visited our table three times to rush us with drinks and to get our check. She over charged us for her very badly made drinks. The other staff, as always are very friendly and helpful. The food and drinks are very over priced for what it is. We will not be returning after this trip. We kept feeling like we should give Reynas resturant another chance, but this one is their last."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in the Strip.  Great taco selection and they are all delicious.  Laura W.'s review really sums it up."}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas. One of few places around who actually squeezes limes to make a sours . A huge array of salsa. Food flavored very well   Wonderful guitar music..  BUT , THE HUGE PARTY OF OVER 20 at 6-7.... Ruined our dinner. They were so loud the place shook. Other couples left also. Too bad they don't have a separate room for loud drunks What a disappointment, we left early and were tense"}
{"text":"Renya's is a great resource for a lot of mexican and south american staples.  While you do need to price shop a bit to make sure you are getting a fair deal it has a lot of things that you just can't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. They also sell some cooking utensils and other helpful things like Yerba Mate gourds and straws (bombia?) of which I was having trouble finding replacements. You can certainly find these things online but I think it is fun to go in and find Day of the Dead candles and authentic pinata's for a mexican themed party and also walk out with all of the food to serve as well. Plus, buy local...I guess...is it local...yeah, is it local if it comes from thousands of miles away??? Now I am conflicted. Moving on... I'm not sure if they still have them, but at one point I got some great plantain strips that I think are made locally. If you ask for them the staff is usually really great with helping you find them. They are called Callaloo or Callolo. Give them a shot, and they are wonderful with all the fresh made salsas they carry in the deli cooler by the registers. If you find yourself shopping with limited time in the strip district you should try the taco stand out front.  Of all the quick options down there this is the best one for a quick meal and the green sauce is incredible on everything (especially the tongue tacos)"}
{"text":"When I moved back to Pittsburgh from New York I found myself in constant withdrawal because I no longer had a taco truck on my block to satisfy my cravings.  I had pretty much lost hope in Pittsburgh until I came across Edgar's Taco stand at Reyna Foods.  These are probably the best tacos PIttsburgh has to offer.  The tacos are also picture perfect.  I have never seen such a beautiful taco.  Seriously.  For only $5 (plus tax), you can get two tasty and fresh tacos.  The ingredients are super fresh, and the tacos are prepared on the spot.  The actual taco is a perfect blend, and they are packed full.  I got the carnitas and pollo tacos.  They meat was not spiced as well as I wanted, and they were a little too mild for my taste.  There also wasn't any sauce/salsa/etc. out, and this lead to a rather mild taco.  However, I plan to come back for the full experience soon.  This is definitely the best place to find real deal tacos in Pittsburgh.  The staff was super friendly, and I can't wait to try the burritos as well!"}
{"text":"Only experienced the bar and was very satisfied with the friendly service! I will be back! Excellent margaritas too"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, went to Reyna today to check out the fabled tacos.  The were all that was promised and more.  Everything was super fresh, and the cilantro and lime make it special.  Really a treat."}
{"text":"The taco stand is pretty amazing. At $2.25 a taco (as of this writing), the prices are quite competitive with Edgar's around the corner. While the variety of tacos is a tad smaller than their competition, Reyna's is pretty standard as well. We basically end up deciding between which wait is shorter when it comes down to it, since the quality of tacos is more or less the same between both stands. No freshly made agua fresca here, but they often have a cool bucket of glassed drinks such as Mexican coke or Jarritos, which pair well with your tacos.  The grocery store is an added bonus (or maybe the taco stand is a bonus to the store?). While a bit cramped inside, they have lots of the standard Mexican produce, snacks, and drinks. Great place to shop or walk around if you are in want of anything for your fiesta or cocina."}
{"text":"It's not really super-convenient for me to go to the strip unless I have a plan and a few things I want.  Coming from Shadyside means I need to get in my car and drive, and I don't really like parking in the strip, and then it's always super-crowded on the weekends, etc. etc. etc.  But for a chorizo burrito from that taco stand? I would travel to the ends of the earth for one of those!   Reyna Foods is one of those places that makes me really wish that Pittsburgh would have a street food revolution.  Every popular part of town should have food carts.  They're quick, convenient, and delicious.  Reyna is hopefully a trend setter, and definitely a hard act to follow.    The folks who run it are always smiling, and are pretty dedicated to making sure you get your food exactly the way you wanted it.  I personally like my burrito \"con todo,\" except for sour cream.  The hot sauce they put on it? Fantastic.  A burrito from this place is a solid, high-density mass of stomach-filling bliss.  Another upshot is it's not like any other burrito you're going to get in town.  It's a great combo of fresh and rich flavors.    There are only two complaints I have, and there's only one REAL complaint I have.  The real complaint is that the line sometimes gets really long, and it takes a while to get served.  The fake complaint is that it weirds me out a little that they toss the burrito in the microwave for a bit at the end (seems like a Sheetz move to me,) but it really don't affect the quality of the food, so who cares?  As for the store itself? I don't really have enough experience with it to say much.  But try the taco cart ASAP!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Texas for a few years now so I'm jaded about Hispanic grocery stores.....  HOLY MOLEY  no really their guacamole is some of the best I've ever had in my life and the fresh tortillas kick ass here. Pittsburgh got a real gem in this store.   GO"}
{"text":"What a great find.  Best tortillas in Pittsburgh - my fiance and I were beginning to despair of ever finding 12-inch flour tortillas to make burritos (which we like to do way more often than our arteries appreciate), when a fortuitous series of events pointed us to Reyna's.  The cooler near the front of the store had plenty of 12\" tortillas of varying types, and some smaller flour tortillas, but none of the kind we wanted!  I asked one of the employees if they had any 12\" flour tortillas, and he led us to the back, where he opened up a large box, pulled out two packages of exactly the kind of tortilla we wanted, and said, \"How many do you want?\"    Now, that's my kinda place.  We proceeded to grab everything we'd need to make burritos that night, short of the chicken we already had at home.  And then, for good measure, we got a jar of roasted green chiles for another night's chile verde, and some pineapple-and-chili-pepper lollipops, because, where else in this city have we seen those???  I can't wait to try out the taco stand one of these days.  Reyna Foods is a quintessential Mexican grocery.  Hie thee hence for all your Mexican grocery needs."}
{"text":"Almost everyone is leaving a review for the taco stand outside of Reyna Foods which has nothing to do with this grocery store! The taco stand is owned by a different person, not by Reyna Foods. They may use their totillas but the food is actually made by Edgardo (the old Taco Loco owner) and recent owner of Edgar's Mexican Cuisine.   Reyna Foods does carry everything you need to make an authentic Latin dish (I know, I'm from Argentina and I can find anything here) but their prices can be high; like for example their empanada dough. They only carry brand \"La Salteña\" (from Argentina and the best brand out there) they are frozen though. I'm still hoping for them to get Goya or other ones (that wont come to mind at the moment).  They also have many argentinean brands of Dulce de Leche (I don't care if this one is pricey because as fattening as that is, and as tempted as I can get with one pot, I don't mind not being able to get it). And Yerba Mate, all of the brand from Argentina and Paraguay, and they also have them in flavors.  UPDATE (Dec. 2013): Reyna food has replaced Edgar's tacos stand and Edgar's tacos has been moved around the corner, closer to Pamela's on 21st Street. You can't miss it."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! I always get the fish one which is mixture of fish and rice. The corn tortillas are homemade and they have buckets of sauces on the side to choose from. The tacos are a little bit small and not very filling but it's fun trying out all the food stands down the Strip anyways. The tortillas can get very soggy though and hard to eat so I recommend getting a fork. But the tacos have great flavor, especially with their sauces."}
{"text":"If you are looking to open that Mexican cook book and try some recipes you will find everything you need here BUT you will pay for it! This place is extremely price gouging!   Some items you can't get anywhere else so I buy here. Cotija cheese ($8.50) a salty crumbly white cheese to top many a Mexican dish, Chorizo ($12.00) sausages that I open and cook as a mixture to add into egg chilequiles, and as a side to hueuvos rancheros. Note the $5 chorizo is not right, it's super greasy when heated up on the stove. It's meant to be dryer, salty, spicy. A great add in homemade adult macaroni and cheese too. Mmmmm.  The back of the store aluminum garbage bins contain all the dried chilis you may need for mole or your own saucey concoctions.   I especially love the bug candy! I love to give it as gag gifts! So would you like red, blue, or green hard lollys with a special surprise of cricket, worms, or scorpion! Haha. Pinatas adorn the ceilings and you can watch them make the tortillas from scratch. It's such a festive atmosphere that makes me miss my familia south of the border!"}
{"text":"This has always been my 'go to' place to buy the most awesome, authentic flour tortillas.  I always  bought them fresh, still warm at times.  I have often served them at my  home and have sent many friends to shop there. Yesterday, I raved about how wonderful they were to a total stranger and we both bought 2 packages from 'the fridge up front'.  I was so so very disappointed and if the person I 'sold' them to reads YELP, I apologize. They were dry and stale.  Steaming them made them somewhat edible, but..... Which leads to my next review.... I was so excited when they opened their restaurant as they sell  such tasty tacos on the street.  I have been there 3 times.  First off, THE  BEST margarita!  Food ok but service......horrible!!  The most efficient wait staff appears to be a 10-12 year old boy who has made our guacamole and aims to please.  When we were there over the weekend, the waiter outside  could do nothing more than tell us how busy he was and how he had to take the steps with each order. He got our salsa order wrong so needless to say, we left.  This makes me sad to write this. Did they bite off more than  they can chew?"}
{"text":"Reyna Foods offers a respectable selection of Mexican (as well as some Latin American) grocery goods.  I'm no expert on these genres of food, but I must say that the variety of hot sauces available is impressive to me!  A lot of the sauces come in decorative or comical jars, making for perfect little gifts for the hot sauce lover in your life.  (Everyone knows a hot sauce fanatic or two, right?)  The tortillas are really good and fresh, and I love that this place occasionally sells bagged Pittsburgh black and gold tortilla chips!  Always seems to be a nice selection of small and large piñatas here as well.  There are a lot of character piñatas like \"Dora the Explorer\" and \"Finding Nemo\" though--kind of weird/creepy, but whatever!  Reyna Foods is worth a stop for sure, even if you're not particularly into Mexican or Latin American food.  Nice people and fun things to look at."}
{"text":"Good: Mexican groceries in Pittsburgh Better: The chipotle tomatillo salsa, homemade by Edgar. Best. The taco stand.  Seriously, if you're here, get a damn taco."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is really cool. The paintings are so nice, and there's a Mexican vibe to the whole thing. It's also downstairs which adds to the mystique. TVs scattered throughout made it easy for my group to watch the World Cup, and everyone in the bar simultaneously errupted when (Germany) scored a goal. The one drawback to being downstairs is that phone service can be crummy.  The group I was with was about 25-deep, and it took the server a long time to take our orders, then to bring out drinks, and to bring the food. We had no reservation(technically we called in advance but Reyna lost the reservation), which may be why they were not so prepared. Despite this, they managed to seat us all together at a lengthy table.  Once the food and drinks did come out, I was super pleased with my order. I got lengua because it seemed unique and I liked that, as well as a chicken taco which was also delish. It came with a few chips and rice and beans which all served my pallet well. The margs were typical margs, with the pitcher being enough to serve 4-5 heads.  I'd return but only with a smaller group. Even though I didn't get the best service, the waiter was very energetic so kudos to him on that."}
{"text":"I have shopped here periodically over the last 8 years I have lived in Pittsburgh but after this last visit NEVER AGAIN! The woman working there was so rude I could hardly believe it. A gentleman came in speaking Spanish and she gave him attitude and even after he started speaking English she was still rude to him.  I accidentally dropped a small bottle of hot syrup ( my bad) I apologized profusely and felt so bad I bought a bunch of other stuff- even after the woman was really nasty about the whole situation. After I walked out I realized she charged me for the broken bottle without even telling me! I guess I should have just walked out without buying stuff. Its a shame because they are close to where I live but next time I'll take the trip to one of the Mexican groceries in Brookline."}
{"text":"This place by name is the Mexican Grocery but the Taco shack right out front is what I am writing about.  I tried both their tongue and pork tacos and they were both solid (I've had my fair share of tacos in Texas and Oklahoma).  The thing that really makes this place though is their fresh watermelon juice!"}
{"text":"I seriously enjoy shopping here. I cook Mexican-inspired meals a lot at home, and their shop carries some of the most authentic stuff for that purpose. Bonus: even though Reyna's is a specialty shop, they're not over-priced for a specialty shop.  Some highlights: Their tortillas (corn and flour) are made fresh daily in the shop. Bring your kids; they will enjoy watching the tortillas trolley on the conveyor belt. There is a variety of flavors, too. I enjoy the garlic and herb, AND they are only 80 calories!  Also, if you love tortilla chips -- or if you need a large quantity for a party or football game -- get the huge bag of them. You will never go back to Tostitos once you've tried their chips. They are the real deal. And the large bag is a great buy -- you can buy 4 bags of the On The Border Brand at Sam's Club for the same price and still not have as many chips combined as what you get at Reyna's. I got a bag of supermarket chips after having theirs, and the supermarket chips were so bland and tasteless in comparison.  Their salsas and guacamoles are fresh and vanish within hours of opening them. Buy more than you think you need. It will disappear.  I have yet to try the Taco Shack, but am curious to what they entail. I am sure they are worth it, and I know I will wonder why I waited so long to try them.  Also, the family that runs the shop are so nice and friendly! I have gotten in many conversations with them, and they are willing to help in any way they can. And they take pride in the products. That's the most important thing."}
{"text":"Chili di arbol sauce/salsa, La cacique mexican table cream, and some seasonings in bulk size for a great price are just some of the reasons why coming here is worth it! Great for a home cook looking to watch their pennies but put food on the table. The restaurant they have serves great beef tounge tacos too!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Pittsburgh from New Mexico and was excited to hear about this place. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I hoped. The cashier argued with my boyfriend over what kind of dried red chiles to buy, and harassed him when he was browsing the store (she yelled across the store: \"Are you done yet? I already started ringing you up.\"). The house-made corn tortillas were bland and only with the help of a guy running a nearby taco stand (who did not work at Reyna's) did we find the right chiles... The cashier had no idea what we were asking for.  Then there was the Hatch green chile fiasco. Shortly after arriving here, I was searching for Hatch green chile in the area and found out Reyna's would be doing pre-orders. Hooray! I ordered and paid for some online. The website said they would be roasting at the store so I called to ask about it. I was told in a very rude manner that roasting would only happen at the pepper festival, which I would have to pay $7 per person to attend, just to get my chile and get it roasted. Okay, fine. The day before the festival I called the store to confirm that my actual pre-order would be available at the festival. I was mid-question when the clerk on the phone interrupted me: \"What? ... Can you call back later, I'm really busy.\" WTF?  So I go to the festival to get my chile. The people at the roasting station seem confused when I present my pre-order receipt, but they eventually figure it out, telling me to come back later to get t because it isn't roasted yet. We walked around the festival for an hour then went back, and there is even more confusion over whether ours is ready. Finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile. Hooray!  Oh wait though. We get home and open it up and... Apparently they don't know how to roast it correctly. We bought bulk roasted chiles in New Mexico every year and never had issues peeling it before freezing it. This chile they roasted? It's somehow completely mushy and falling apart, but has almost no visible char, and it's fucking impossible to remove the peel. It's horrible.   So tl;dr - rude employees, both in person and on the phone. Little product knowledge. And absolutely no knowledge of how to roast green chiles, despite having a whole event around the chiles. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I haven't been inside the store itself...but the taco stand. Holy shpimoly. My friend and I were wandering around the Strip District and after just eating a huge meal at Vietnam's Pho, we were pretty full. But when we saw someone walking by with a super delicious looking taco, we wanted to try them, and we found this stand. OMG. OMG. I literally foodorgasmed. The tacos were really cheap-- $3 a taco, I think $5 for two? They were freshly made right in front of us, and they were soo flippingly good, me and my friend couldn't talk for a bit after eating them. DEF coming back here!"}
{"text":"I've been to the taco stand now!  Yaaaaaaaaaaay!  On our way out of town for the holidays, we needed a quick snackie and made a stop at Reyna's for taco deliciousness.  We got four - two chicken, chorizo, carrnitas.  YUM.  They were so fun to eat - messy, sitting in our car, hot sauce dripping down our fingers - who doesn't love street food?  Seriously, this is the only place I've laid eyes on in Pittsburgh that appears to sell tacos of this kind.  I kind of want to go back....like, now.  OH BUT WAIT.  Stop.  the churros.  On a whim, I ordered some churros real quick, and watched the guy pour the batter into hot oil right before my very eyes.  They floated around, browning and sizzling, then he took them out and put them directly into cinnamon sugar, into a paper plate thing, and then into my hands.  They were the best churros ever.  Love at first bite.  Love just watching them sizzle!   I think I want to try empanadas next time if I can tear myself away from the tacos."}
{"text":"La Reyna food market is the Pittsburgh go to place for all food Latino in the strip. Authentic wide variety of product and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The stand outside (edgars), chicken taco with everything on it, best ever."}
{"text":"\"Jalapeno tostadas...yum!\" That was a tip I shared a while back, let me go just a little deeper. That Hot sauce you found, loved and could never locate again? Reyna's has it. Biggest hot sauce collection in town. The same goes for BBQ sauces, any Latin ingredient you can think of, salsas out the wazoo, HANDMADE tortillas and tortilla chips so good they supply the best Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh, fresh salsas, scorpion lollipops (for your wild, still sweet self), loose beans, herbs and all sorts of goodies in bins in the back....including dried hibiscus flowers that I make my mango hibiscus daiquiris with!  Whatever you need, Reyna's has it. If they don't, ask...they do their best to get it! And don't miss the taco stand outside or the restaurant downstairs. Whatever Reyna's does, it's top notch!"}
{"text":"I lucked out today.  There actually were outdoor tables free and only a couple of guys in front of me in line.  So, this is my first experience at Reyna's taco stand outside their grocery in the Strip District.    I had 2 pork soft tacos with everything on them for $5.00.  That's a cheap meal and tasted exquisite!  What made then extra scrumptuous was the cilantro.  Oh, I love cilantro on my tacos!"}
{"text":"The website purported itself to have fresh inventory from its tortilla/tostada factory. When I walked into the store everything was dusty. Reminded me of the old corner stores of Mexico in the tiny pueblos that only hold on by pity because of expired inventory (but great selection of potato chips). I looked for said fresh tortillas and tostadas. None but broken tostadas were found. The lady working there wasn't even Latin/Hispanic... which was disappointing to me. She didn't even speak Spanish. She ignored me and socialized until I interrupted her conversation which she was none too pleased about. I inquired about where I would be able to find a meat product and she had no idea what I was talking about. Her friend that didn't even work there was more help and nicer but even she didn't know either. The selection was dismal and I was wary because it was so dusty! Out of all the list of things I was going to buy I only got the canned hominy corn. I dusted off the price... expensive. Not surprised. Explored a little more, got nostalgic at some of the products and then went to check out. The lady was rude the entire checkout. I thanked her on the way out. I don't know why. Never going back... might try the restaurant though, but reviews are 50/50 there too."}
{"text":"This is the only Mexican market that I'm aware of in Pittsburgh and they always have everything I need.  They have a huge selection of dried chiles.  The freshly made tortillas are awesome.  Whenever I stop in I usually always grab some empanadas from the deli case.  YUM!!  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"AS for the place, it is awesome!!  Fresh corn and flour tortillas are to die for, a little pricy, but there is no other choice in Central/WesternPA.  The Taco stand outside is awesome, it surely satisfies the cravings for tacos from a Taco truck in California, while being right here in PA.  It is in a tourist area, so regular mercado items are way overpriced!  Also I would give 4.75 stars, but not an option because it is owned by Americans and they are taking the big profits while the Mexican people doing all the work are probably getting minimum wage or less."}
{"text":"A superb Mexican grocery store. It's a great place to pick up fresh tortillas and chips. They carry large selections of spicies, sauces, dried peppers, beans, and rice. They also carry cooking supplies such as molcajates (bowl used to make guacamole). I like that they usually have house made salsas and dips to try at the front of the store. The final kicker is the collection of piñatas hanging from the ceiling."}
{"text":"I think this should be more like 1.5 stars. I got a 6-pack of tamales. They were more expensive than I would've guessed (I sort of had to, considering they weren't priced). First I open the package and low-and-behold this bag of six tamales, in fact, contains only five! The filling is fine, but the masa blows. It is dry and gritty. The preparation instructions seem questionable (microwave in a plastic bag? Really?). I'm saving the remaining ones for when I'm too drunk to care about anything. The tortillas are still worth it."}
{"text":"Not only is Reyna's market great, full of all kinds of dried peppers, cured meats, cheese etc... They have the most amazing taco cart out front. The line was crazy long but totally worth it.  Next time I'm in town this is a must stop!"}
{"text":"TACO SHACK. HELL. EFFIN. YES.  $5 gets you two pork, beef or chicken tacos. $3 a taco for chorizo or fish. They've also always got a special of the day... but all these little taco delights are special. Special and effing delicious. These are the freshest tacos I've ever placed inside my mouth. My tastebuds were singing in delight- or maybe that was just me."}
{"text":"I don't live in Pittsburgh, but if I did I would buy food from here all the time. I bought homemade flour tortillas and made fajitas with which to enjoy them. They were fluffy and fat and so delicious. I wish I could buy these tortillas all the time!  They had plenty of other specialty foods, so if you need some Mexican goods, this seems like the place. I really would love to try the tacos from the cart out front, too!"}
{"text":"A real taco in the 'Burgh.  Four stars would easily be five if their portions were just a tad bigger, but wow is the food here good.  Reyna has been satisfying true taco lovers with amazing tacos for awhile now and it finally seems that the rest of Pittsburgh has caught on.  There always seems to be a line of people salivating for the fresh ingredients and unique flavors that only Reyna offers in the Golden Triangle.  I absolutely love their beef tongue taco and their pulled pork version.  The salsas are fantastic and people are always mucho friendly. Do yourself a favor and eat your way through Pittsburgh's Strip and get one or eight tacos from the friendly folks at Reyna."}
{"text":"Even a NYer was telling me to get tacos here, so I did. Pretty good. Loaded more than I'm used to. They make their own tortillas which is respectable. It's fun to watch people order tacos here, this is a real taste of Mexico, and it seemed new to half of them. Pittsburgh is a great town because the vendors aren't afraid to give the people something real - they even have tongue.   That chinese food truck across the street though.... it's good, but way Americanized."}
{"text":"Two delicious tacos for $5.  Awesome!  Corn tortillas with your choice of the usual meats but also lengue (tongue).  Fish and shrimp tacos cost a little more.   Don't forget the great sauces -  the green is mild, one of the red sauces is very hot - just look for all the pepper seeds floating in it.  They were making enchiladas that looked great.    Go inside and get some of the chips from their chip factory or take some tortillas home for a make it your way, since you can put almost anything delicious you want into a taco.  Come eat tacos, Explore the store!"}
{"text":"This place is the go-to grocery store in the strip for everything Mexican. All the tortillas are homemade and created right in front of you. The shelf in the back has the freshest selection of tortillas, the ones we grabbed were still warm! They have great guacamole and an assortment of salsas and queso toward the front of the store, they even have some samples out if you're having trouble deciding between flavors. If you want to channel your inner chef, they have every fresh pepper you can think of and dried peppers in barrels to add some spice to any dish you're making. And if after all that shopping in the Strip District gets you hungry, they have a taco stand out front for authentic street tacos before going to your next store."}
{"text":"Vegans, lend me your ears.  I discovered today that the taco stand in front of Reyna's offers two types of vegan tacos!  Yes, I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw the word \"vegan\" on the menu.  Of course I ordered myself a carnitas burrito and my gf the black bean taco (also included rice, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and cilantro).   My gf could not stop raving about the flavorful beans and refreshing toppings.  She even hates cilantro but found herself liking Reyna's cilantro.  The other vegan option is SOYRIZO!  Yes, you heard me!  I was in shock when my gf mentioned \"That bean taco was so good I don't even want to try the soyrizo.  Just give me more of those beans!\"  So there you have it.  Even if you're not  a big bean fan, taco fan, or fan of the strip district - this taco stand is worth the trip.  Price is either $3/taco or $5/2 tacos.  Cash only.  On a side note, my carnitas taco was also really flavorful.  I can't wait to go back and try the other meats they offer."}
{"text":"Reyna's is not just a Mexican grocery -- it also carries a lot of products essential to making Caribbean, Latin American, and other such foods.  But in its heart and soul, Reyna's is primarily an excellent Mexican grocery store.  The fresh tortillas are excellent, the prices on the Mexican cheeses are literally a third of what inferior Mexican cheese costs at the supermarket, and the sauces and salsas are almost uniformly delicious.  Plus, if you're hungry, you can usually get a pretty decent snack here.  They have tamales/burritos/tacos/etc., and also dessert-type stuff like conchas.    This place is completely indispensable if you're at all interested in cooking even remotely-authentic-tasting Mexican dishes and you live in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I have been to the Burgh 3 times and I make sure I hit the taco stand up every time I am here.  Great authentic tacos and great prices."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican place! I got the enchiladas verdes which were a little too spicy for me but very good. My boyfriend got a steak quesadilla which was AMAZING! I wish I ordered it. Friendly staff and comfortable setting!  Been here twice... The second time I ordered the guacamole which they made fresh in front of u! We loved it and will order it again."}
{"text":"Reviewing the taco stand out front: the tacos are delicious, with the right blend of cilantro, onion, tomato and other goodies. Freshly made and worth the trip down. They are, however, pricey! $3 is at least a dollar too high for street tacos, imo. But then again, I'll still buy them..."}
{"text":"I ate a taco here in the snow. IN THE SNOW! I've eaten a taco here sweating my bum off. I\"ve eaten a taco standing up because there's no tables. This taco stand is so amazing that I'll pretty much eat a taco here during a hurricane....if those happened in western PA!   Does this not show my true devotion to these tasty little taco's! Ok, I lied. I like them so much I just do it up big and get a burrito. It's just a magic mixture of rice, cheese, salsa and lots and lots of lime. I'm into the shrimp burrito because i love me some shrimp. But really, any type of meat or a veggie choice is going to be awesome. Plus they are cheap cheap cheap!   Do me a favor and stop by this stand while you're out shopping in the strip, you will not regret it. Rain, snow or sunshine!"}
{"text":"The only place where I can get my taco fix while I'm in Pittsburgh?  Legit.  I always get two lengua tacos.  Lengua is Spanish for delicious, so that's why I always get two lenguas because that's double the awesome (lengua is actually Spanish for tongue, but I find lengua makes for some of the best tacos; super savory and always tender).  Take a fresh tortilla, warm it up on the grill, and top it with a pile on the lengua.  Yes, onions, cilantro and a squeeze of a lime wedge would be preferred, but I guess the Pittsburgh market prefers the lettuce tomato with sour cream deal.  The customer is always right.  At 2/$5, it's a bit pricier than what I'd expect a taco to cost elsewhere, but in Pittsburgh competing with other food vendors in the Strip, it's priced just right.  They also do chicken, pork and beef tacos as well as burritos ($5 as well), but if you're in the mood for awesome, do yourself a favor and get some LENGUAAAA."}
{"text":"Easily my wife's favorite tacos in Pittsburgh. Pick your meat and then it is filled to the brim with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and cheese. I kind wish they let me fill my own tacos, but it isn't really practical since they generally have a line on the weekends.   The grocery has the best tortillas, tamales, and salsa in town. I bought the jumbo container of their taco seasoning so I can imitate at home."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Mexican grocery in the strip, this is the place to go!  They always tend to carry unique vegetables needed for Mexican meals.  In addition they make their own homemade tortilla chips and salsas.  There is also a fun taco stand out front with great authentic corn tortilla tacos."}
{"text":"These are super good tacos, burritos decent too! Tons of lime juice, cheese and fillings. The market can be pricey but they have harder to find items. I go for the taco stand primarily. Top authentic taco contender in the burgh."}
{"text":"Yes, I went and had the tacos. YES, the lengua tacos. YES, I KNOW!!! They were good. Did you also know that you can buy homemade tortilla chips in hella bulk, along with any kind of sauce you can imagine? If you suddenly need plantains for a questionable contribution to a fireside potluck, you can get those here, too. I'm not sure what else you can really ask for in a Mexican food store. Nope, pretty sure they've got it all. Oh, if you buy a plantain that is pitch-black, or you find that your plantains at home have gone pitch-black, simply slice them open, place in oven, bake until warm and tender, then spread with guava paste (available at Reyna Foods). So the man at the counter tells me. True story."}
