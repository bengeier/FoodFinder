{"text":"One of the best Mexican food I've had in the GTA. The chef is also the owner, which helps explain the good quality food. The service was excellent and fast. Only drawback is that it is small so may not be able to accommodate large parties - call in advance."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've had good Mexican food and this place delivered. Don't miss out on the fried ice cream, it's probably the best I've ever had.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch. Prices were reasonable and service was nice and quick.  I had the fish tacos which were good, my wife the burrito. Also very well made!"}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING food!!!!!!!  Best in all of Aurora!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Plus the chef amd waiter are super nice and good looking. I finally found a place that serves amazing mexican food."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the place. Our server was attentive & kept things moving during our meal. They have background music & simple authentic decor made it feel intimate & authentic. Especially the glasses & dishes as they look like they came right from Mexico. The little wooded spoons to serve the Salsa Fresca on the home made chips was a perfect touch. We started with a Margherita & Mojito, both very tasty & fresh. The Black Bean soup came out piping Hot which is just the way I like. A large serving that could be a tasty meal. The Tortilla Soup was served in the traditional manner, rich, flavourful, yummy. Shared the Tacos (Carnitas) with green sauce & Chiles Rellenos. The green sauce was so fresh, great flavour. Seasoning was spot on but spice level could be upped a notch. We asked for some hot fresh peppers to add to our food which was good as my wifes 'heat' level is much lower than mine. A good solution for both our tastes. We needed a bit of time before ordering dessert as the servings are filling. Churos & 3 Milk Cake, another Yummy... Prices were fair, not expensive for what you get & market value for the drink prices. We're looking forward to returning to explore a few other menu items."}
{"text":"Great Mexican place. Came by for lunch. Reasonable prices and great food. So flavourful. Friendly service. They were celebrating their 1st year anniversary and even better lunch specials. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was beyond bland..they had drinks from Mexico which was cool but it doesn't make up for the lack of taste in the food."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant after a friend recommended it. We were there on a Sunday evening and it was quite quiet so didn't need to wait on a table. The food was very fresh and we enjoyed the mexican music while we ate. The kids loved their taquitos and burrito, with leftovers to take home. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I guess I have been spoiled with really good Mexican food living in the South. I was not impressed by this place. I got a margarita; not very good. And I got sangria; it was pathetic. My husband and I shared nachos and I could have made way better nachos at home.   Come to think of it I could have made better drinks too and saved myself $60. Won't be going back, and still in search of a decent Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Went early 4:30 but food was fresh and delicious! They don't have much of an alcohol selection yet but we weren't going for the wine! :) the tacos, churros, and tres leches cake were very good. Best Mexican in the aurora area hands down."}
{"text":"So far the best Mexican food in the area. I thought Made in Mexico was good, but this place has great food, is much quieter and has very friendly service!  The chicken enchiladas are awesome! Nice fresh salsa with chips for the table. Great value and great, fresh food!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican. I can't wait to go back. I had the enchilada and I really enjoyed it especially the side of Mexican rice. Very filling food. Chef was kind enough to visit our table to ask how our food was."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican in the heart of Aurora. Food is fresh. Very tasty. The service was great and the chef came out to introduce himself. Nice guy. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. Very authentic flavours that are easy on the palette and leave you wanting to come back.   The staff are welcoming and helped me pick a drink. The margarita and mojito's were great.   Try the three milk cake for dessert if you have room - dee lish."}
{"text":"Their food is good, it is a traditional type of a Mexican food. It is a little bit different from other Mexican places which was interesting. Since the place is small they have slower service and their hours are limited which is annoying cause we wanted to go but they were closed.The owner of the place is a polite gentleman who keeps asking everyone if their food is good or if they need anything. I and my husband really like his customer service. In total I would give them 3.5 but since I can't I rather to give them 4."}
{"text":"Well the decor was beautiful but the fish tacos left much to be desired. And although no fish taco I've had in Ontario even comes close to fish (fresh from the Gulf of Mexico), served at the roadside, there was one place around here that was pretty OK. Apparently I was in the wrong restaurant!  The fish were like \"fish-sticks\" in a soft taco covered with cole slaw and a really mild strip of sauce. Rice and black beans came with it, which I did not expect but would hardly call a bonus. There was one lonely Tostitos chip sticking out of it, which I dipped in and devoured but only left me craving more chips. Also just one little slice of jalopenia, for decor I guess.  Biggest complaint is that all the food is prepared behind a barrier wall out of view. Hmmmm, makes one wonder, what are they hiding? Sorry, I won't be back. I like to see my Mexican food assembled right in front of me....even if it was just take out! ADDENDUM: Hungry so I removed the overcooked inedible \"fish sticks\" and filled the tacos with rice and black bean sauce. Managed to get one down."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time tonight and was thoroughly pleased. It was a taste of Mexico with the authentic cuisine and environment. The staff was super friendly and hospitable. If you're in the area, be sure to stop by. I'll definitely be making a return."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant  We love Mexican food and this place is just amazing.  As Authentic as it gets.  We had the Tamales and Fajitas (beef) just as good as any 5 star restaurant in Toronto. My wife got 3 Margaritas and I had to stop her. Staff very friendly.  Chef came out and say HI, classy.  Tres leches cake best cake ever...  We are glad we found this Mexican place. coming back this weekend for sure"}
{"text":"Didn't like the food. Bland and boring. Small portion. Chicken was tasteless   Server was even boring. I could have made better fajitas and enchiladas. My husband wasn't full and he had the enchiladas. Wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Today we went for supper it was very good food everything was delicious and the service was great and we will be back again soon. This is the best Mexican place I ever tried."}
{"text":"I am leaving a second review which never happens!!! We came back and had the burrito and chimichanga This place is hands down the best Mexican  restaurant in York region. Made is Mexico does not even compare  to he authenticity of this restaurant. Neither does the Mexican restaurant on main street Unionville  in Markham.  The chef once again came out to greet every table and the place was packed. If your not from new market this restaurant is well with the drive and you will not regret it. If you are from new market that frequents another Mexican restaurant  you definitely need to make the switch to Dos Mariachis you will not regret it.  The staff here are so polite and it feels like your over at someone's house for dinner  I love it!!!! Compliments to the chef!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the cactus salad, my husband said the chicken burrito was the best he's ever had."}
{"text":"If you enjoy authentic Mexican - (not texmex) then you'll love this place. Pozoule soup is amazing and light and the portions aren't huge which is good because you can order 2-3 different things and share them family style.  The food took me right back to northern Mexico sitting on the beach. Prices aren't bad too. Service was great, chef came by to check on us. I wish they had tamales on the menu or al pastor but maybe they will soon. :)  Definitely try it. (Better than that place on Main Street for sure but equally as good as mexicanada for those who have been there)."}
{"text":"What a nice place for authentic mexican food. Went for lunch today and had the tacos. Very authentic and tasty too. The server was very amiable as was the chef that came out to greet a few customers. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place does not open Sundays as per their yelp page.   Came here from Markham for nothing.   Should have called them first I guess"}
{"text":"Took a while but decided to give the restaurant a second try. Service was friendly and food served hot. Ordered tortilla soup and fish tacos. Soup was flavourful. Fish tacos were ok, fish cooked perfectly but the accompanying slaw was bland. Service of pico de gallo and chips came out after we ordered guacamole and chips."}
{"text":"Lovely little Mexican restaurant with cheerful decor, very good service and good food.  I almost forget i was in Aurora, felt like a 2 hrs get away."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem. I usually don't do much Mexican food but decided to check out this place since the reviews were pretty good. Had a mommy night out and the food was pretty amazing. I had the chicken chipotle.. on point. A bit of spice but really really good. The environment is really relaxing and just a cozy place. The server was very nice! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place and very fast service. Complementary dishes were provided. Food was very good, a good place if you want decent food very fast and causal."}
{"text":"Overall scores Food : 3 Service: 5 Value: 2  I'll start with the good. The service is very friendly and fast. Ambiance in the restaurant is very relaxed and homey, with nice decor and pleasant Spanish music playing in the background. Overall it makes you feel welcome and want to stay longer. The chef even came out and greeted every one, that was a nice touch. I tried the margarita bull and it was great, maybe could use a bit more tequila.  Now the bad. We first got our guacamole appetizer and although the home made chips were ok the dip fell short. It was bland and needed more lime and salt. Then the entrees, we first tried the chilles rellenos, which sounded much better on paper. It was literally a few mushy balls of meat and peppers on top of lettuce and a side of rice and salsa. Taste wasn't horrible but the texture resembled baby food, for $17!!!. Then we tried the fajitas which at first glance looked appetizing and came out sizzling as promised, however as we started digging in we started to notice the flaws. The biggest ones were the fact that they covered it all with some tomato sauce, I think that should be an optional side. The second and biggest flaw was the beef itself. It was overcooked to infinity and tasted like it was boiled then blasted in the oven to give the plate the sizzle. I was very disappointed and had better quality fajitas at chain restaurants. To top it all off we found a long black hair in the pouch the tortilla wraps came in but we didn't say anything as we were just over it and didn't see the point.  Overall the bill came to $70 for two people. I honestly felt robbed and like it was very poor value. Seriously I have no idea how they justify it and look people in the face when they charge that much for what I consider to be cheap eats. Will I ever return? Doubt it."}
{"text":"i could seriously rant on about how much i did not like the food but honestly Id much rather compare it to mexican amigos, read their reviews and you'll catch my drift. not recommended"}
{"text":"Excellent!  After driving around the mall 5 times, I finally noticed the clearly obvious sign.  Thankful that I did, because I was just about to give up and settle for something that would not have been as enjoyable.  I had the soft tacos, and the server was perfectly happy to allow me to mix the three options.  I added a side of guacamole, creamy, smooth, buttery and delicious.  A touch of hot sauce and I was hoovering down the plate.  This is a very nicely kept place, cheerfully decorated and playing some of the best background music I have heard in a Mexican restaurant.  The server was extremely helpful, and the chef took a moment to come out and check up on my experience.  I was too busy stuffing my face to engage in conversation, so I might have appeared standoffish.  Top of my list of repeat visits!"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about this place. Price was decent for what you get. Food isn't bad. My only complaint would be the fact that the filling was so sparse. I ordered chicken tacos and there was 90% chunks of onion instead of the actual chicken. It gave off a cheap impression to me."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent Mexican restaurant without having to go downtown!  The Playa Cabana restaurants are our usual go to restaurants, but we always wanted something close to home. It was out first time visit to this restaurant.  We were a group of 8 (4 adults, 4 kids).  If you're looking for a really glitzy place this is not it.  However, if you're looking for great food and even better service, look no farther.  We had the guacamole, enchiladas, burritos, carnitas, fish tacos and chorizo tacos.  All phenomenal!  You can cater to your level of spice, which was great for us. The chef even brought out a special sauce for us which was a blend of Carolina Reaper/Trinidad Scorpion pepper....now that's a sauce!  The Bulldogs were great (not sugary sweet) and the desserts were equally good.   I've been to Mexican restaurants all over the States and in Mexico.  This place was on point and way better than Made in Mexico.  Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night,  loved the place very cozy, little mama papa place, great service food was really good. Loved the fish taco hubby ordered the steak taco but agreed that mine was better, beef was a little dry one advice wood be dim the lights a little & maybe a double door entrance, every time some one opened the door we were freezing, overall pleasant evening"}
{"text":"Bad customer service!!! My family of 3 went in at 6:30 tonight and was told by the waitress that they were booked until 8 pm and will not serve us because we didn't have reservations. I called and spoke to the same lady 15 minutes earlier but wasn't told that reservations were needed.   There were only 3 groups eating in the restaurant and at least 7 vacant tables. We requested if we could just order churros but the same waitress and the counter person said that they're too busy. Too busy with just 3 tables???  My wife asked to speak to a Manager and again was told that they too were busy. Even a churros takeout would have to wait until after 8 pm and they're not even sure if they can make it for us. I felt bad for my son who just wanted churros but all the restaurant staff made us feel discriminated and unwanted."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch before work at around 2pm. It was tucked away in a plaza, on first glance I really loved the interior, very \"Mexican\". Server was really friendly and was a pleasure to chat with. As for the food, we ordered the guac with chips to start which tasted really fresh and the chips were 5/5. For mains, we had the fish tacos and the chicken, chorizo and carnitas taco trio. The fish tacos were sub par and very underwhelming, same with the other three tacos, my favourite was the chicken tacos. Everything was just OKAY. Not sure if I'll be back"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give them a higher rating than my last visit in hopes that they improved but unfortunately it is not the case with my recent visit. My son and I ordered nachos to start. Very small portion compared to other places and it didn't taste so great. I ordered the enchiladas. They were ok but I felt like they must have been sitting out for awhile because it was almost cold by the time it was brought it to me. I ordered the 3 small tacos for my son. Chicken, ground beef, and chorizo. He ended up getting 2/3. Ended up with pulled pork instead of chorizo. I really had high hopes as this was my third visit. Unfortunately, I won't be returning. I gave them 2 stars because service was ok."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a New Mexican resto on the verge of opening nearby.  So when we dropped by this evening for dinner, I was pleasantly surprised that it was different than the other Burrito restaurants in the area. It is a quaint, family run business and it being Saturday night, had a mariachi singer/guitarist for the evening.   Sometimes these things border on cheesy but, in this setting this lovely man with a beautiful voice singing Spanish songs with passion, fit the bill.   We are here to eat though, so on to the food.  We ordered mojitos, guacamole and chips to start.  The drinks were well made and the guac was authentic as we have had in Mexico.  We ordered enchiladas and fish tacos which both came with refried and rice.  They both seemed a little bland buy we didn't leave any on the plate.  To finish we had a churro that was to die for.    The chef came out to speak with us and thank us for coming which was a nice touch.  The service by his daughter was lovely. All in all a very nice experience, one that I would repeat, if not for the mariachi singer, definitely for the churros!"}
{"text":"Best quality mexican restaurant in Aurora/Newmarket area. Nice decor seems busy, a bit pricey but enjoyable. Three enchiladas and negra modelo beer $23 w/o tip and tax. 5 stars if the wifi worked."}
{"text":"Great food, service and truly authentic Mexican food. Our new favourite restaurant in Aurora.  Well done!!"}
{"text":"Craving for some authentic Mexican food and decided to hit up Dos Mariachis, a popular local Mexican restaurant in Aurora. It is a cozy restaurant with fantastic food and service, colourful decors, and lively music playing in the background :)  My friends and I had a delicious meaI prepared by owner/chef Estaurdo and the kitchen.  We ordered fresh guacamole with tortilla chips to share, and it was delicious. Tacos were flavourful - you can order an assortment as well :) They all come with a side of rice and black beans. Fish tacos was decent, the fish does look like fish sticks but flavours are definitely there.  For drinks, we tried the refreshing piña colada and it was very creamy and tasty! One of the best coladas I've had. The Mexican Bull was served in a fish bowl with a mini corona beer bottle flipped inside it... this margarita drink was also very good :)   Even though we were full, we couldn't resist ordering dessert! Sugared churros with chocolate sauce were crispy good. I always love a nice hot and fresh churro. Tres leches cake was a bit sweet for me but my friends devoured it in seconds lol.  Overall, very delightful meal. We will definitely be returning again to try more items :)"}
{"text":"Mexican gem! Trekked all the way here from Richmond Hill to nom on some good Mexican food & great drinks!!!   Food: Appetizers- ordered the tortilla soup & the Mexican nachos. mmmmm it makes me hungry even thinking about it! Get both!! The tortilla soup is to DIE for. So rich and flavourful, with authentic Mexican flavours. Served with a side of avocado and nachos. The nachos give it a great crisp on the side and to dip, and the avocado if eaten with the soup makes it more rich and hearty. Rich and hearty is exactly what this soup is! The nachos are very good! Also recommend but you can't definitely not miss out on the soup.   Entrees- As a group we ordered 1 chicken enchilada, 1 chimichanga and Flautas. All were very good, flavourful and filling. The enchiladas were ordered with green sauce, very filling, saucey and full of chicken just like how they're supposed to be. Chimichanga was pretty big, packed, with savoury flavours. The Flautas were my fave because they were crunchy on the outside, 4 of them, made to a crispy, crunchy perfection! MMMM!!! If you like hot, ask for their hot sauce on the side (their hottest hot sauce), tasty but be careful there's ghost peppers in there! For all you heat fanatics I highly recommend!!   Dessert- ordered the tres leche cake. Wasn't a big fan. It was good, but got quite bland. TBH I've had better elsewhere :(  Drink- Mexican bulldog!! Served in a huge fishbowl! I always love going to Mexican restos with great big alcohol servings! Corona in a margarita! Yum!   Price- $$. Ranges from about $10 and upwards. Averaged about $13-15 from what I remember.   Service- Exceptional. Waitress was very attentive. After the meal was all over the chef/owner? Came to check up on us, see how we liked it, amazing! Well done.   Would 100% make the trek back here for Mexican! Not often do you find a really good Mexican resto! Must try!"}
{"text":"It was so great to finally find a good Mexican restaurant north of the city.  The food was very fresh and tasted fantastic.  They had a good selection of items on the menu as well.  We had the chimichanga and enchiladas and three milk sponge cake - all of which were amazing.  Service was great and the chef even came out to see if our food was to our liking.  It's hard to find a good authentic Mexican restaurant like this.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch today with my youngest.  They brought chips and homemade pico, very fresh, very tasty. I had the Pozole soup to start, nice kick, very good. For lunch, Flautas were my choice, nice presentation, food was flavorful and authentic. My youngest had the beef burrito, she loved it, I had some to try it, must say, was pretty darn good. This place is local, family run, and I dare say, best in region. We will be back to try other items on the menu, and maybe sample the margaritas!"}
{"text":"Dam good Mexican food. I would highly recommend the enchiladas, the chimichangas, and the churos. Very tasty food and very good prices. Definately a great place to eat at or pick up from. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"The portions are small with not a lot of filling for the price. The basket of nachos with pico de gallo was so small, we ran out of chips before we barely touched the salsa. Added gaucomole and it was an extra $8! Food was just ok. They try to upsell you on food and drinks."}
