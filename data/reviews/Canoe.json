{"text":"Very impressed with the view, ambience and service. The food left me with mixed feelings only because both the appetizers (foie gras, mushroom soup, seafood platter) and dessert (highly recommend the double milk chocolate peanut butter, blueberry cheesecake) were impeccably amazing, yet their entrees were 'okay'--simply no surprise. 

The kitchen and bar mixed up our orders twice where they gave us the wrong drink and for some odd reason, the mushroom side was bitter. Nonetheless, the server we had was amazing, and was able to fix the problems without any hesitation. In fact, he came back apologizing for the bitter mushroom after the kitchen staff tried it themselves (a note that I was shocked with). 

You can never go wrong with the view, 51 floors high with two panoramic views of downtown Toronto is always breathtaking. The server was amazing in his service and hospitality -- he exceeded my expectations when he went out of his way to help us take photos with the downtown background (moving tables, opening curtains, spotlighting). He was a professional server and detailed photographer. 

Definitely going again! Canoe lost a star because of its 'basic' entree."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent.  The view is outstanding and even the bar area is nice if you just want a few cocktails and bar bites.  They are closed on Saturday and Sunday for private events.  I had the wild boar and my husband had the bison ribeye.  We ordered mushrooms for a side.  For dessert we had the chocolate mousse.  The meals were expertly prepared and the presentation was perfect.  Our waiter was top notch.  Their bread is good and the cornbread is also very tasty.  Cocktails are very good (and unique) as well.  If you have not been to this restaurant put it on your \"must do\" list!"}
{"text":"I loved every minute of my experience at Canoe. 
We went for the Summerlicous dinner menu. 
I had the pork  main, cornish hen terrine app and ganache cake. Everything was impeccably plated as well as delicious. 
The service was spot on all night long and the view unbelievable. 

Be sure to order The DIll Pickle as your drink. I am usually a gin martini kind of girl but the dill pickle was perfection."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, every dish is a fun experience, and the view can't be beat! This is our go-to special dining place. We don't care that it might be perceived as touristy--we loved it."}
{"text":"good experience here coming for date night. Free parking under TD tower and wonderful ambience you really won't get elsewhere. Dishes were hit and miss I would definitely say the dessert was unimpressive."}
{"text":"Came for winterlicious lunch. Great view and service, awesome food! I had the salmon and my coworkers had the steak. We also tried all three options of the dessert, every one of them was exquisite."}
{"text":"I think my money was not worth spending at this restaurant, though the view looked amazing, we didn't get a chance to sit by the window. The food was only 5 out of 10, and the service was also not so great."}
{"text":"I love everything about dining at Canoe.  From the food to the decor to the view to the service.  Let me start first with the food, the caribou is amazing and every time I've seen it on the menu, I've ordered it without fail.  Other items that I've tasted out of the kitchen have been impeccably executed with flavours and textures that always keep you interested.

The decor is beautiful and the service is friendly and professional so you never feel like you're dining at the stuffy or uppity restaurant that the steep prices may imply.

My one recommendation is that if you want to truly enjoy your experience at Canoe, try to go outside of the Summerlicious/Winterlicious time as I've heard that the quality of the food can waiver when dealing with the mass volume of patrons."}
{"text":"I would love a window seat during a thunder storm!! 

I wasn't sure if validated parking was available for lunch... The website only mentioned dinner and weekends.

The prices were decent! A bottle of wine will run you up quite a bit. I made reservations online last week but wouldn't get a window table since it's made a month in advance. 

We started with the crab and tuna salad and the raw oysters. Both were great! 

Our entrees were probably less than ideal, my lobster clubhouse fell apart. The land and sea was a very small portion and was unfavoured. 

I would probably want to see the dinner menu myself. I would be unwilling to go during summer or winterlicious as you don't get to see the classic menu.

For dessert, I shared the chocolate torte and it was delicious!! I would definitely get that again :)

Hope this helps!

{"text":"I sent my parents here for their 30th wedding anniversary as a surprise, and it couldn't have turned out any better. Grace from the reception helped me coordinate all the details weeks ahead of time, from the pre-authorized payment form, table reservation request, surprise anniversary dessert, and taxi ride after dinner- she was amazing and always diligent with calling me back and keeping me updated. My parents were given a table right beside a window as requested, so that they could enjoy the spectacular view. They absolutely loved all the food, and said that the staff was exceptionally attentive, and went out of their way to make sure that the momentous event was perfect. They had the mushroom soup (best they've ever had, they said), the salmon, the lamb, the chocolate mousse, and and another tart. Thank you to everyone at Canoe for helping to make my parents' anniversary so special and memorable. They will definitely be back- next time with me hopefully! Cheers"}
{"text":"Went there first time for my birthday and I fell in love with the restaurant.. Great view of the city, great food, amazing service, couldn't ask for more. When I couldn't decide which wine I should have, the waiter brought 9 different kind of wine for me to sample and choose, I was thrilled ! Been there a few times now definitely my favourite restaurant in town."}
{"text":"loved it! and not that pricey for the quality of ingredients! i highly recommend the spice cake, it's unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Arriving just after the power lunch crowd, we still had to wait about 10 minutes for our reserved table at 1:15. 
Very busy restaurant. 

The decor was simple and clean and the views over the city are second only to the cn tower itself(then again you can't see the cn tower when you're in it)

We ordered the maple cured bc salmon gravlax, which was very succulent. The flax bread accompaniment was light and crisp. The smoke salmon garnish was wrapped around some greens and enoki mushrooms and was good but didn't outshine the actual gravlax. 

For mains we ordered the tortiere, and a special for the day, a striploin with a caribou and escargot ravioli garnish. Certainly a unique meal.

The tortiere was very heavy but nicely seasoned with the slightest hint of nuts. The pie shell was not crunchy but was very aromatic, strong enough to contribute to the beef flavour.

The striploin was cooked perfectly, and was cooked as is to get the pure beef flavour. The raviloi was al dente with a strong filling. The bed of mashed potatoes were very creamy. 

The service was good, but the food took a while to come out. When the bill came, I sincerely wished I had a business visa to charge it to, but it was a very unique meal with a special view."}
{"text":"Visited canoe on Saturday night for winter licious  it was again great food .. We also attended summerlicious which was by far better in the service department .. The last visit was above and beyond amazing the waiter was fantastic as was the manager who approached the table to introduce himself .. Not so much this time the service was the same as a milestones which to me is ridiculous.. 

Let's start off by the bread here is normally fantastic and mouth wateringly good. We did not get to find out till 20 min in we asked for bread since the waiter had no intentions of bringing us any .. The wine pairing terrible it was not very appealing and small pours less then 4 oz which is a big difference from the summer it was a very heavy and pleasing pour .. The waiter took our orders and never returned to follow up and or chat and ask how we are .. No manager visit even though he was in the kitchen lingering at the entrance .. Odd we thought and it was not super busy and I am not one of those whinny eaters .. The food fantastic duck pot pie as an app Great venison stew for main was the best of the three we all agreed as everyone ordered different .. And apple cake for dessert ! Stellar the cider on the other hand with the pairing gross !! Not much apple flavor and about 3 oz .. It's cider people come on !! 

So we left feeling rather unsatisfied food good that's about it !"}
{"text":"Visiting Canoe : Taste Maritimes
    What an experience. My faith and confidence in the so-called food experts and publishers in Toronto has been altered drastically . I also try not to blame this mishap due to a Monday 5pm booking. Yet I feel that the average diner has been misinformed and betrayed by the experts' malfunctioned papille (taste bud) on their tongues .
    Canoe, being on the 54th floor,has undoubtedly provide a wonderful view for diners. Apart from that, we find that the dinning room staffs were adequate but not outstandingly charming. Initially, in order to ensure a successful dinner outing, I visited Canoe and did a mini tour and was given a copy of the menu. Nevertheless, on the actual date,our waiter claimed that it was an outdated menu  and out goes my preparation. After considerable considerations, we decided on participating in Tasting Menu namely Taste Maritime and hoped for delightful surprises along the way.
    We started with \"Kiss the Cod\" and quite surprisingly, it felt like a dagger into our hearts. A small chunk of breaded fried cod was placed on a small folded paper plane using yesterday's Global mail with news about the Plane clash in Ukraine . Remembering Fish and Chips in the UK ?  Our jolly British folks either use clean  white or brown wax paper to wrap the fish and chips before wrapping it with layers of newspaper. The smell of newspaper print was very uninviting and having food with newspaper symbolized times in old Hong Kong when poor family could not afford to dine with table cloth.  Not too auspicious and a result of poor research.
    Second dish,\"Jiggs Dinner Terrine\". We were having a difficult time trying to comprehend what the serving assistants were talking about. However I did hear the word \"Enjoy\" at the end. At any rate,  a few pieces of miniature corn beef and vegetable were stacked together in a pretentiously artistic manner inside a square tile plate with a circular center. It appeared very uninspiring ,amateurish and normal. Our expectation of being \"Wowed\" had started to spiral down.
     Our waiter tried to build up our anticipation by describing where the inspiration of the third dish,\"Clam Bake\"originated from. However , the actual dish was simply a few clams and mussels, placed in a hot ceramic  container covered by a piece of seaweed . The assistants approached with a steamy hot kettle and poured hot water to soften the dried and over baked clams . It was alright and I manage to separate the sand from the clams while eating.
      \"Cloudberry\" provide a moment for us to recollect ourselves as we swallowed 
a spoonful of ...............berries. It was also the moment that I discovered that my special guest at the end of the table has no placemat the whole time. Fail.
      Whether we choose \"Hodgepodge\" or \"Meat and Potatoes\"  has already become insignificant.The whole group were totally demoralized by the first three dishes and all we anticipated was the finish line. 
      I've been to a lot of good restaurants in Toronto and thoroughly enjoyed many inventive tasting menu that offer adventurous yet balanced and pleasing food. In this particular visit ,we have mistakenly trusted the kitchen as they did not demonstrate any culinary skill nor did they provide any taste satisfaction.My trip to Canoe has been very disappointing and more so for my special guests that flew in from Hong Kong."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the tastes here.  I had foie gras with nuts and jelly for my appetizer and it was a foodies comparison to the PB&J sandwich.  So many emotions came together when eating this dish - my food journey had reached it peak and i wanted my mommy all at the same time. I had the braised short rib for my main and it was delectable, fillings and well presented.  I don't go to places like this very often and I would love to have this experience again."}
{"text":"This is just a short review based on my several times of dining out at Canoe.

Only Con - it is expensive, very expensive. But, I suppose that is what you have to pay to get food this flavorful at an upscale restaurante

Okay, with the negative out the way I will move onto the positives which is where my 5 stars come from:
FOOD -  AMAZING! One of the few restaurants where I have put a spoon or fork into my mouth, closed my eyes and was taken to another place. Exquisite combintation of flavours and textures. Just sublime. I remember, once for Winterlicious, I had some sort of salad scattered with crab or lobster and avocado veloute - divine. I remember, another time a while back, I had this apple crumble - sensational. I also loved the Alberta lamb and lentil dish.  
SERVICE - exceptional, extremely professional. 

Probably my favourite restaurant in Toronto. If I only had more money, I`d be a regular."}
{"text":"Took advantage of Winterlicous to go here for a prix-fixe lunch on a Sunday with friends.

The staff are super-friendly and very attentive so top marks for service.

We were seated at a table by the south-facing windows. The view of the downtown and lake from the 54th floor is fantastic! We watched planes take off from and land at the island airport.

Most of us had the Butternut Squash Soup for the appetizer. It was delicious and the sunflower seeds that were mixed in complemented the squash. The flavour wasn't too strong so it was some of the best soup I've had.

For the main course I decided to try the Vanilla Braised Rabbit with polenta and mushrooms. I can't recall the last time I had rabbit so I wanted to be a bit adventurous. I found that the rabbit tasted not unlike chicken (why do so many things taste like chicken, btw?) but a wee bit gamey. Now to be fair to the chef I'm certain it was prepared perfectly but I guess rabbit is not my thing. Perhaps I should have had the salmon instead, which some of the my friends had and said was wonderful.

I really enjoyed my dessert which was the Pear & Rosemary Bread Pudding with Maple Anglaise. The serving size was appropriate but to be honest it was so good I wished I could have had seconds.

Highly recommended! Note that Canoe is not normally open on weekends; check their website for the hours."}
{"text":"I ate dinner at Canoe with a group while in Toronto on business.   I had the 45 day dry aged ribeye, which was cooked perfectly medium rare.  None of the appetizers or salads on the menu appealed to me so I didn't try one of them.

The food was good and the view was fabulous.  I enjoyed my meal, but it isn't somewhere I just HAVE to go again."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant!!! It's my go to spot when I have someone visiting the city for the first time. Not only does it have excellent food but also amazing views. The best time to go is dusk so you can see the city change from day to night, request a table by the window and watch the world go by!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for their Summerlicious menu.  For $45 each, we got a delicious introduction to their Canadian cuisine with a view that can only be rivalled by 360 at the CN Tower (but their food doesn't come close to Canoe).  

The menu was seasonal and local where it could be and flowed nicely from course to course.  Despite the portion sizes not being massive, we were completely satisfied when leaving.  The three courses were each flawlessly executed and beautifully presented.  This was not a cheap dinner by any stretch of the imagination, but I definitely look forward to the next time we decide to splurge on a special event at Canoe."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Canoe for a date night. We heard pretty good things about the restaurant and decided to give it a go. The service was great (as expected for a high-end restaurant like Canoe) but the food sadly didn't quite live up to our expectation. 

We ordered a beef tartare and ceviche to start with and both appetizers were just decent. The fluke of the ceviche was bathed in passionfruit juice, topped with fried seaweed. The taste of the ingredients didn't go that well together and the beef tartare wasn't outstanding. We had the tea smoked duck breast and the pork with kimchi, chinese broccoli for main course. The duck breast was slightly overcooked so it wasn't very tender but we quite liked the sauce. The pork loin was definitely disappointing as it was literally just shao ro (those crispy pork that you can get at chinese barbecue stores). It cost around $45 for that dish and it was so overpriced for what it was. The meat was pretty dry too. We finished off the meal with a dessert - 46% milk chocolate with peanuts and banana cream. Again, it didn't leave a strong impression. 

So would we go back again? The bill came at $225 for two including cocktails (tax and tips included). With that price and quality of food, it's disappointingly a no."}
{"text":"I was enthusiastically recommended to visit, and it was great! Service was friendly from the moment I walked in. The lunch menu was good. I got the steak tartare and the tuna. Complementary bread was served. I think it was pumpkin seed, and I missed what the spread was. Steak tartare was amazing! There was bacon dust (!!) and pickled okra on it, among things. It was served with pretzel crackers. The tuna was also fantastic. Seared and seasoned beautifully. Squid ink mayonnaise and kim chee pickled veg on sushi rice. I opted out of dessert, but not sure that was the right choice now :) I had a great visit, would love to return for dinner or the dinner tasting menu. Oh. I forgot the view is just icing."}
{"text":"I didn't think canoe was anything special. Looking at the reviews and ratings I thought this was one of the best places to eat in toronto. I don't care for the atmosphere. Much too formal. We had about a dozen different waiters bring the different courses. The food was mediocre. I have had much better much cheaper. The view is nice."}
{"text":"Yes it was really five star good! We came here for the Summerlicious menu not knowing how truly popular the restaurant is (hey we're from Chicago) and were lucky enough to snag a table. 

We had walked around the financial district for about half an hour before we found the restaurant, and by the time we arrived we were all hot, sweaty and a bit out of sorts.For some reason we thought the restaurant was going to be ground level. A nice Torontonian finally clued us into the fact that it was in an office building on the 54th floor. 

We shot up a bank of elevators and into a dimly lit hallway ready for the Canoe experience. Imagine our chagrin when the hostess, all smiles, asked for our reservations. Thankfully some poor soul had canceled their table and within minutes we were ushered  into a beautiful mossy green and chocolate brown dining room surrounded by windows overlooking the lake and Toronto. As soon as were seated our drink order was taken and we were soon enjoying a very light and refreshing sangria with green apple. We were given a small bread plate with a dish of fresh hummus. I'm used to having a spicier hummus, so to me it tasted bland and I would have much preferred a bit of olive oil or a knob of butter.

For the appetizer my friend and I ordered the Holland Marsh Leek & Potato soup with marinated baby shellfish and chive oil. It was a cold preparation, extremely creamy, smooth and utterly delicious. The chive oil delivered an important depth --  but the shellfish was the star. (As I'm writing this, my mouth is literally drooling.) I definitely won the appetizer wars, as my husband ordered the New Farm Green salad with Nam Prik cucumbers, toasted sesame seeds and avocado dressing, and although it was very tasty, it could not compare. I think the bread stick in his salad was the star.

We each chose a different entree and each was truly scrumptious. My Wellington County Flatiron steak with smashed Cookstown fingerling potatoes garnished with corn and wild leek aioli, was beautifully presented and again -- delicious. The meat was extremely tender and so flavorful. My friend ordered the potato gnocchi which was also amazing, and my husband the Lake Walleye with crisp skin. There was no talking at the table as we were too busy eating, Our water glasses were always being refilled, and our server was unobtrusive but vigilant. 

We all ordered the Bitter Sweet Chocolate Terrine with vanilla marshmallow and strawberries for the last course and it did not disappoint. Seriously, if I could have picked up the plate and licked it, I would have. We savored our dessert, sipped our tea and coffee, and watched the fog roll in over the lake. Truly a spectacular meal and all for  $25.00 each (not including drinks or tip) -- could you ask for anything more?

Our server saw us perusing a map after coffee and was kind enough to give us directions to the subway (which is conveniently located in the lower bowels of the building itself) to our next destination."}
{"text":"Been here business lunch as well as romantic dinner with my wife. This place Is wonderful. The food is fresh and delicious. The menu changes up so you get a variety  of excellent options. The servers are attentive, knowledgeable and focused on making your dining experience exceptional. And, the view. Awesome. If you are in Toronto, you must go."}
{"text":"I didn't find Canoe all that great food wise - I had a mushroom soup which was really too thick and though I love mushrooms, the soup was way too mushroomy. I also had some fish which was bland and salty. The view is great and the service is extremely attentive as well. But food wise there are a lot of better places in Toronto for your money."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews on Canoe, I had high expectations. I left disappointed. The food was very bland and tasted quite dry. The service was excellent and the presentation of the food was beautiful, but if the food doesn't taste good, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Here's the deal: it's difficult to rate a place like this with under 4 stars, simply because its atmosphere alone can earn half of that score.

So, while I'm rating this place as 4 stars, I will break it down in 2 sections:
- Atmosphere: 5 stars
- Service: 5 stars
- Food: 3 stars
- Value: 4 stars (strictly speaking of summerlicious)

I had the Chilled Cucumber Soup, Rock Cornish Hen and Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse.
Could have skipped the soup, it was...badly executed.
The cornish hen was nice, but nothing spectacular.
The best part of the whole meal (oddly enough) was the dessert.

Overall, one of those places one has to experience at least once, but not necessarily because of the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing, and it was a great close to a wonderful (and recent) trip I took to the Toronto area. Firstly, the ambiance of the restaurant was great and they have beautiful views of the city that I was able to enjoy during sunset. I had requested a table view that they were able to accommodate when I made my initial reservation, so that was already a huge plus in my book. 

I have to give a huge shout out to our wonderful server who took care of us this evening, Terrence, who was very informed about food and wine. He was great and definitely made our dining experience all the better for my family and me. He was truly spectacular. 

The food was delicious too! For the appetizer, we got the Raw Bar option, which I would definitely recommend and was enough to split among our family of 4. It came with 2 different types of oysters, shrimp cocktail, ceviche, and tuna and salmon tartare. For my main, I ordered the duck, which was cooked to a tender and flavorful medium rare. 

The desserts we tried were also amazing! We split the panna cotta, classic butter tart, and the hazelnut chocolate torte. 

All in all, I had a wonderful time here and I will definitely be back the next time I visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"Been here couple of times.  The ambiance is nice and the view amazing.  The staff were great and gave us a walk through the kitchen.  The service was amazing.

The food is different but not exceptional.  It is over priced and for that amount you can do better."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? The quality of ingredients, creativity on the plate, and the finished product are always bang on. Great service, ambiance and view as well - this is a fabulous restaurant for any occasion."}
{"text":"My boyfriend at that time took me here for our anniversary. This place was absolutely gorgeous and if you get a window seat, you can overlook downtown Toronto.  The food was superb and the presentation was lovely, the atmosphere was super romantic and the staff were very knowledgeable, friendly and kind. It is rather pricey, but for a special occasion, it's definitely worth it. 

Note: The restaurant is a little hard to navigate to. The signage wasn't all that clear and we ended up looping a bit before we found ourselves there."}
{"text":"The price put a damper on the experience: the food reached beyond its grasp on a number of the dishes. But the view is breathtaking, the service was better than just good (friendly, knowledgeable, helpful), and the place indulges you if your looking for an impressive, ritzy night out. Sadly, I'm far more oriented to cheap quality than hyped pricey. I'd go back for a drink at the bar though!"}
{"text":"Our table was for a group of four 17 year olds during Winterlicious. Because of our age, we were looked down upon by the servers. We requested a window seat and once a table opened up, were refused to be seated there since it was \"for a larger party.\" The table could only seat 4 people. They insisted that there were \"more parties arriving later\" (It was already 2:30pm), even though plenty of other tables were available. Why did they say they would try to seat us at a window when we called in advance if they clearly had no intentions of doing so? Our server was rude, and again, alluded to our age as he called us \"kids\" while speaking to us. He often gave us eye rolls when seeing us do something that \"kids\" normally do, and even when he saw the tip, which was a gracious 15% from \"kids\" who merely have part time jobs! We came to this restaurant wanting to be treated the same as regular customers, but felt we were at Swiss Chalet, or something of the equivalent in terms of the service. We called in advance, and mentioned multiple times during the meal that we were celebrating a birthday, yet no waiters, hosts or dessert noted that it was for a special occasion. We had read previous reviews of their fantastic birthday service with the beautifully designed desserts saying \"Happy Birthday\", yet probably because of our age, they chose to ignore such a small request.
Nevertheless, the food was exceptional, everything was fantastic and cooked perfectly. This was the only reason why our overall experience was memorable. The portions were fantastic and the unlimited pork infused bread was to die for. I ordered the cod rilletes and was given the fois gras, however it was delicious so I did not complain.
The view is fantastic, although on the day we went it was foggy and not much could be seen clearly. 
I will probably return again during Winterlicious or Summerlicious because no matter how great the food is, I am not willing to pay the regular price for the lack of service they provide. Maybe next time I will bring some \"adults\" with me so I can get the proper customer service."}
{"text":"Went here recently for our anniversary dinner.
We ordered northern woods mushroom soup for starter, our mains were meat + potatoes and Alberta lamb.

- The food presentation was great and the portions were just right for me.

- The northern woods mushroom soup was amazingly delicious. I'm quite surprised it was creamless. 

- The beefs and lambs were perfectly cooked as well as very juicy and full of flavour.  

- Very romantic and classy atmosphere with a gorgeous Toronto's skyline view.

- Fantastic service!! The staffs were very friendly and courteous.  

Overall, this was a spectacular experience!"}
{"text":"If you've only got a few days in Toronto, it's definitely worth stopping by the bar at Canoe restaurant. It's on the 54th floor of the TD Bank building downtown and for a pricey drink you get a view that is well worth the money, overlooking the lake, stadiums, CN tower and Union station. I think the best part about Canoe is that the service is really stellar. They really make you feel welcome in an unobtrusive way, even if you're not super dressed up or look like you have money. I've been here twice now, years apart, and what I remember most are the views and just how lovely the service was.


 The bar isn't huge, so this wouldn't work for large groups. It's better for a quiet drink with a few friends, as you each sit in a stool overlooking a grand drop down to the city below."}
{"text":"The ambience was nice and the food was good too. Giving it 3 stars because I had really high expectations and the salad I got was subpar."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!

This place has all the new canadian style dishes done very well. The ambiance is great and the view is unbeatable if you sit near the window. 

Most of the servers are very professional and courteous.

But yes, this place is the place to dine if you want a fine dining experience at the heart of the city."}
{"text":"Canoe was a very pleasant experience when I was there. The waiter at our table was very friendly and nice and it felt that he had been there in that role for some time and took pride in his job. The sommelier made very good  recommendations especially since he knew we wanted to try some good local wines and I was pleasantly surprised. The views are quite nice but we were not seated by the window and the restaurant was quite crowded and slightly noisy. But for me it didn't take away from the pleasure of fine dining. The food was well prepared but did not stand out for the price range. But overall it was a great experience for Toronto dining."}
{"text":"Like the view of Downtown Toronto. The food and service is great."}
{"text":"I am very thankful for the concierge suggesting Canoe while in Toronto. At first i thought the restaurant would be all about the view and the food would have been just so-so. I arrived there without a reservation on a Friday night but since I was by myself I figured it wouldn't be too difficult to find a place to be seated. I went in to the lounge area and to my surprise it was not crowded and there were plenty of seats at the bar. I was greeted by the bartender and was offered a glass of champagne on the house since she had just poured an extra one. I decided to try the tasting menu \"Taste Canoe\" since it had so many wonderful items. The Amuse Bouche was a house cured tuna with some kind of infused apple. I had never tasted anything like the apple before and it was amazing. Next was an Iced Green Tomato Soup with lobster, ricotta and basil. This dish was presented by the Chef de Cuisine, John Horne and it was like no soup I have ever tasted. All the ingredients married well together and the Pinot Gris it was paired with was just perfect. Next was a Organic Yolk Ravioli with beef cheek, fava beans and asparagus. Once I cut into the ravioli and the egg yolked oozed out the dish was outstanding. For the main dish I went with their Tea Smoked Duck Breast with fois gras, toasted wheatberries, rapini and morel mushrooms. Wow, wow and wow this was a great dish! It was my first time trying fois gras and it was just perfect with the other ingredients! The desert was a wild ginger pana cotta with strawberries and  pistachio cookie. The presentation was wonderful but I am just not a fan of pana cotta. The bartender noticed I had only taken one bite and asked if I like cheese which I responded with a yes. She left for a moment and brought me a plate of two cheeses, crustini, honey and some jam and took the pana cotta away. Like everything else, the cheese plate was amazing. Needless to say I will deffinetly be back to Canoe next time I'm in Toronto. The food was amazing and the service was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Good food on the pricey side.  For special celebration, it is good!"}
{"text":"I was here for lunch with a close group of friends. I feel like everything amazing about this place has been repeated over and over already by others. All I can say is, impeccable service (they anticipated our every need), stellar view, and great innovative food."}
{"text":"Wir waren zum Lunch im Canoe. Nicht nur der Ausblick aus der 54.Etage ist fantastisch, sondern auch das Essen. Die Bedienung war auch sehr fix und freundlich. Wir haben es jedenfalls sehr genossen!!!"}
{"text":"Located on the 54th floor of the TD Bank Building this restaurant affords both beautiful views and marvelous service. Reservations are pretty much required if you want a table. At lunch time the crowd is mostly business people, while dinner is a bit more of a mix. While the restaurant definitely caters to wealthier clientele the menu prices are actually quite affordable if you want a special night out. And the food is incredible.
The service is probably the best I have ever had, unobtrusive yet attentive. While most of their customers are dressed to the nines we didn't feel out of place dressed considerably down the pay scale! 
If you're looking for a nice evening out, or for a relaxed long lunch with friends then I highly recommend this place. It's one of our favourites for our not so frequent girls get together."}
{"text":"The only thing disappointing about my experience at Canoe was that I didn't have room in my belly at the end for dessert.  And the desserts sounded simply amazing.  Dang.

We went for dinner on a Friday night for the late seating.  Everyone we encountered was friendly, gracious and helpful.  Our server (whose name I can't remember) recommended an excellent wine which went perfectly with the starter (which we shared) and our mains.

We started with the buffalo mozzarella with rhubarb and shrimp.  What an odd sounding combo!  But I have never had a more delightful way to begin a meal.  Since we were sharing it, they brought us each a plate with a half portion (so we wouldn't have to fight over it, they said). The presentation was very artsy, and that it tasted even better than it looked was impressive.  I wanted to lick my dish clean.

He had the char, which he described as a seemingly random blend of flavours which ended up working out perfectly.  I had the ribeye which was cooked to perfection and had a delicious sauce.  

I think considering the quality of food, effort in presentation and reasonable prices (for an upscale restaurant), this is definitely a great place for a special occasion or if you just want to go for a bit of a fancier meal experience."}
{"text":"Reserved! : Canoe Summerlicious

I know it's a late review... but here is my late summerlicious review on Canoe in Toronto. For those who haven't heard of Canoe in Summerlicious, it is by far one of the hardest places to book for during that time of the year. Basically you need an AMEX and need to call on the first day! It's hard to get enough that people sell out their reservations on redflagdeals! Anyways, a special person of mine was able to make reservations for Canoe on a weekend afternoon. This place has an amazing view, overlooking Toronto  I must warn you though, this place is kind of hard to find... besides that, Canoe is situated on the 54th floor of the TD Bank Tower. This place is one of the most accommodating restaurant because we were fashionably late for about an hour and they were still able to accommodate us  Now let's put this restaurant to the test! We all know these restaurants with amazing views usually have mediocre food... coming from Vancouver.. ( C Restaurant, Cloud Nine and Nu ) to name a few... they're good but not amazing. The view is nicer, let's just leave it at that .

Chilled Holland Marsh Leek & Potato Soup with Marinated Baby Shellfish & Chive Oil

This is one of the first cold soup I've had, interesting. Clearly the presentation is amazing and its quite flavorful and smooth as well. It also has a generous amount of shellfish inside it!

Pan Fried Great Lakes Walleye with Snow Peas, Rutabaga Slaw & Caper Horseradish Vinaigrette

Decided to try this because I've never seen this on the west coast menu back here in BC.  There was another option on the menu being : Wellington County Flatiron Steak , I took a bite out of it and I prefer the Steak more than the fish... maybe it's because I prefer other types of fish than the Walleye.

Bitter Sweet Chocolate Terrine with Vanilla Marshmallow & Barrie Hill Farms Strawberries

I must say I may be biased on this because I love desserts but this dessert is amazing! Its in between a mousse and a soft marhmallow and simply amazing! This dessert is definitely made with real chocolate and not cocoa butter or cocoa powder. The rich chocolate is paired nicely with the light vanilla marshmallow and of course , the strawberries!

Overall this restaurant has exceptional service, very accommodating to your requests, great presentation and amazing view of Toronto! I would definitely come back on special occasions because it was slightly pricey for an afternoon lunch for the both of us and of course, thank you for the amazing lunch and day in Toronto 

Results: This restaurant's food is actually amazing accompanied with great food and company"}
{"text":"I come here way too often. I'm not a snob, I swear. The food is always perfect, the staff is great, always willing to do something extra to make your experience better than before. I prefer their lunch menu over dinner. You can never go wrong with their mushroom soup, and liver. Yes, i said liver. It's been on their menu forever and for a reason. It's delicious. Their 40$ raw bar is a great bet for afterwork with their amazing cocktails. The bartenders are wizards!!"}
{"text":"We dined at Canoe this past week.  I agree with Talal's review in that the dishes are a hit or miss and I would not recommend to a foodie either.

The view is FANTASTIC! We had a window table facing south and I watched the planes land at porter as we ate.  I probably should have been watching my husband but when do you get a view like this again? lol

If you are looking for a romantic dinner this is definitely not the place you come to even though its ranked as one of the best restaurants.  The room is open, the tables are fairly close together and there is hustling and bustling all around you.  

Our waiter was fantastic! Very attentive, pleasant, and answered every question I posed.  When he couldn't answer one of my questions he called someone over immediately who could.

We started with the raw bar appetizer.  The platter looks large and intimidating but its not as much as it looks. The ceviche on the platter was incredible!  We were not told by the waitress who described the items that one of the sauces for the oysters was a hot sauce.  As I have learned my lesson this was before I sampled the sauces first.  Just dipping my fork into the hot sauce burned my mouth.  That's something that should be explained to diners.  The shrimp had a white cream sauce on them, whatever it was it was bland.  There were also 3 or so \"fish ball\" items.  They were dry for my taste but tasty nonetheless.  Overall I would say the platter is worth it.

My husband ordered the wagyu beef as the main.  We both agreed that the smoked tongue on the dish was AMAZING!  One of the best things I've ever eaten.  The beef however had the same flavour and consistency of any filet we have ever eaten.  I'm not sure what wagyu should taste and feel like but we were not impressed.

I ordered the lamb.  i was told by my waiter that it would be served medium rare unless otherwise instructed.  That was perfect for me.  It came well done. Not impressed.

We both did agree that the vegetables and potatoes that accompanied the mains were incredible.  I could have eaten a whole plate of the side veggies that came with my lamb.  In fact if I ever dine there again I would not order an meat.

We finished off our meal with the chocolate fois gras.  I was worried it would be too sweet as an appetizer, and hey, I can eat fois gras anytime anywhere. The fois gras itself is the best I've had outside of France.  The dish as a whole though did not work for me.  Fois gras just doesn't go with waffle.

Overall the service and view was excellent but when I pay $450 for a meal I expect medium rare to be medium rare. For that reason i would not return unless I was trying to impress someone."}
{"text":"Ignore the bad reviews! From the attentive, friendly, conscientious and thoroughly helpful service provided by server extraordinaire Giancarlo, to the magnificent view of the lake, islands, and CN Tower, to the delicious bread and complimentary cookies and tiny cakes, to the beautifully presented AND extraordinarily tasty dishes, my celebratory lunch with a friend was one of the best I've had in Toronto--and I've had many! I especially enjoyed the maple cured salmon + fogo island crab, while my lunch companion's pasta special with mushrooms and pickled rutabaga was deliciously rich. I can't wait to come back to taste other offerings on the menu! Bravo, Canoe!"}
{"text":"This was the best food from all my fine dining experiences in Toronto. Bravo!

Make sure you get a reservation. I went on a weekday (non special, no winterlicious or etc.) and the place was fully booked. Luckily, they had a decent table by the bar with a great view of the lake. 

I don't think you can go wrong on the menu. Everything was fantastic. Make sure you try the couscous option for the bread."}
{"text":"Honestly I was really looking forward to eating here. There's such a reputation and brand behind the restaurant - the only way I can describe it is its like buying knock off designer goods - looks the part but to the trained eye or in the case the palate its not. We spent alot of money at this place and I can honestly say everything ranged from weird but edible to good but same old. 

I really dont get why people are so drawn to this place. You can get more flavourful cuts of beef at the Keg and the appetizers were weird for he sake of being weird rather than being game changing. 

I wouldnt go back here - if you want good fine dining I recommend Centro, Mistura etc."}
{"text":"Two words: Duck Raviolo.  I am still dreaming of this dish.  I travel for the express purpose of eating (despite the fact that this concept usually elicits the reaction of \"seriously?\" from customs agents).  I am so glad I chose Canoe as one of those meals.

I chose the tasting menu (I am a sucker for them). Every dish was delicious, the service was outstanding and the wine was great too.  The view was so great that I even came another day just to sit at the bar and have a drink (cocktails are also delicious).  I even took home the menu to add to my menu scrapbook (only the really good places get this distinction). 

I actually found this restaurant to be very reasonably priced for the quality.  Perhaps because where I live, this is a normal price for a nice meal?  I definitely did not feel it was overpriced in the least.  Overall, this was easily in my top 2 meals for my entire Toronto visit.  I only wish they had a place in Chicago so I could come more often!"}
{"text":"Was here last weekend, and the food was d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s-! I had the foie gras to start, ordered the duck breast for main, and the traditional canoe tart for dessert. All three were amazing, service was good, and the view from the window was to die for.

A little pricey, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I came here two years ago for a winterlicous lunch on a Saturday. The service is impeccable. But the food is another thing altogether, let me tell you.

We got bread, and the bread was pretty amazing with a nice dipping sauce.

Pate appetizer - That was ok, nothing good to say about it nor nothing bad to say about it.

Polenta and Rabbit - Disgusting, disgusting. I couldn't even finish my plate which smelled like decomposing something. 

My mom got the lamb pappardelle - and that tasted almost as bad. She was forcing herself to eat it, it was soooo gross. Just had no flavor and smelled of lamb. 

Dessert was some kind of tart and that wasn't bad it just an average dessert nothing great. 

I don't know why our meals were so horrible. This was two years ago and I still remember the experience. Our waiter was a nice Indian guy, extremely polite and friendly. He asked me why I didn't like my meal and I didn't know what to say, I've never been in this position at a restaurant. 

I don't know how their regular food is, maybe they feed all the food they want to get rid of to the winterlicious people, who knows. But I could never back here again."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious and I was very satisfied with my meal. The wellington country flat iron steak was really good!

For desserts, I tried all three on the summerlicious menu. The one that really stood out to me was the bread pudding.

Will definitely return for winterlicious coming up!"}
{"text":"Based on the fact that I had my wedding reception here, my review could be a little biased but being an extremely picky customer I walked into the restaurant expecting to give it a four star rating and walked out with a five. 

The service was fantastic! what an amazing group of staff ! 
Spectacular view , probably one of the best in downtown TO. 
Finally but not the least, simple, quality food with an amazing wine list and an excellent bar! 

A great place to hold functions or even reward yourself with a quick drink at the bar on a Friday afternoon!"}
{"text":"My new bride and I went to Canoe for our celebration dinner on the first night of our honeymoon in Toronto. I chose Canoe because of the interesting menu and solid reviews that promised quality food and spectacular views of the city. The views were indeed incredible, especially from our table near the corner. The views were just the beginning of what would be one of the greatest dinner experiences either of us has ever had.

Our server, Ian, immediately greeted us with congratulations on our marriage and complimentary champagne. Shortly after, the manager greeted us and offered her congratulations. Throughout the evening the service from all parties was absolutely impeccable.

We started with the maple salmon candy, which is as delicious as it sounds. Salmon coated with maple syrup...uh...yes, please. Served with avocado, nori, and some sturgeon caviar, it was an interesting and delicious mix of flavors.  My only complaint about the dish was that it wasn't about eight times bigger.

I'm glad it wasn't, because had I eaten eight times more, I wouldn't have wanted to order a second appetizer. We went with the venison tartare, and that may have been the best decision we made during the entire honeymoon. Well...at a restaurant. Rarely would I use the word \"stunning\" to describe food, but this dish deserves such accolades. From the venison to the bacon to the peppercorns to the mustard seeds, every part of this dish was perfectly delicious and seemed to melt in our mouths before we had a chance to actually chew. We truly savored every bite, it was one of the most memorably wonderful things I've ever eaten. I felt as though I could have eaten a metric tonne of that stuff.

I'm glad I didn't, because had I eaten a metric tonne of that stuff, I wouldn't have ordered such a wonderful main course. Both main courses we ordered were equally delicious, she had the barley risotto, I had the wild boar chop. Her risotto was cooked perfectly and despite my well documented hatred of onions, the charred onions in the dish were actually very tasty. My wild boar was also perfectly cooked, very tender and quite flavorful. Portion sizes were perfect and the accompaniments were all delicious. My wife very much enjoyed the wine that Ian recommended with dinner.  

The desserts we chose were incredible, and the fact that they came out with \"Congratulations\" written in chocolate on the edge of the plates added a perfect touch of niceness and class.

The entire experience was thoroughly enjoyable. The service was great, the ambiance was relaxed and calm, the views were amazing, all of the food was delicious, every drink was just right. We couldn't have been happier with our dinner at Canoe."}
{"text":"Yummy, but not as good as Richmond Station.

First, the view is amazing. Loved the ambiance.

Our server was super cool. He was very patient with my friend who is... difficult and eccentric. 

We opted for the tasting menu. We started with this sort of bizarre amuse-bouche. An amuse-bouche is supposed to be one bite, this was 2-3 bites that tasted like deep-fried sushi with weird crunchy spidery leg things sticking out of it. It was hard to eat and overly kooky. We then had the lobster dish (so good) and the duck egg raviolo (amazing, I could eat this everyday). For the main course, I had the halibut in cocoa butter and she had the wagyu. My fish was amazing, moist and perfectly done. I was suspicious of the cocoa butter, but it was truly great. My friend's dish, on the other hand, was not great. The beef was tough and the presentation looked like a Super Mario Bros. landscape, blocks of meat and other things strewn about the plate. Meh. The crème brulée dessert was delicious though. And... the wine pairings were spot-on, very nice indeed. 

If I'm ever in Toronto again, I will definitely revisit. I might not get the tasting menu again though. I want to try their entrées."}
{"text":"Summerlicious 2014 lunch at Canoe was as amazing as every meal I've ever had there, and the service was spectacular. 

The hostess heard my wife say something about our anniversary (not planned on our part, Scout's honour!) and two complimentary drinks appeared, including a non-alcoholic cocktail for me. It was a strawberry-black pepper purée/juice and it was very tasty and completely unique.

The food was super fresh, tasted of the season and there was much complexity of flavour, which I love.

Some could complain of portion size, but it would depend upon your choices and how much you expect for a 25.00 Summerlicious special. 

I was completely satisfied with the salad, turkey schnitzel and chocolate/coffee cake, and, as always, the spectacular view, complete with window washer scrolling by...

rl"}
{"text":"I really do love this restaurant. They're expensive, yes, but the food is wonderful, the staff are various levels of good (ranging from pleasant & professional to really warm & lovely), the view is TDF and if you call with a weird request (one year for my anniversary I asked them to create a menu without prices like an old-fashioned 'ladies' menu') they're happy to oblige.
If you can squeak in during Winter/Summerlicious, do. It's super-difficult; they book up in seconds, but try. It's a great way to try a superlative restaurant for a low price. Otherwise, save it for a special occasion, but do try it. It really is worth it."}
{"text":"This Restaurant was amazing! I had hot Foie Gras with a chocolate glaze, homemade waffle, a marshmallow or s'mores flavored  fluff and blueberry coulis. The mushroom soup is also delicious with truffle flavor. The service was great with many friendly waiters who take the time to explain your beautifully presented meal. Ask for table near the window so you can see the incredible Toronto View. Great Treat especially for Tourists or a business lunch."}
{"text":"I was not excited to try Canoe.  I thought it was going to be an over hyped, over priced, pretentious, somewhat good restaurant.

I was wrong.

Every cocktail, appetitzer, meal and dessert we had was divine.  A party for my tastebuds.

And the service?  Amazing.  

I'm a fan.   I highly recommend, and I would most certainly go back."}
{"text":"A must-try - even if it isn't for dinner, try lunch!  Knowledgeable staff, amazing food.  Their black cod is to die for."}
{"text":"We came for Winterlicious dinner, so we were expecting it to be busy. Still, the restaurant did a great job in keeping everything well organized. The servers were very attentive and took time to describe what we were about to eat when they brought the food. Food was top notch! I got the Fogo Island Salt cod for appetizer, beef tenderloin / chuck flat for main, and sea buck thorn yoghurt for dessert. Some places don't really give good value for Winterlicious, but Canoe was definitely worth it! I would come back on any regular day / night."}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch with some out of town guests a few days ago. Hostesses more interested in chatting and giggling to one another. Service from our main server was good, however the general feeling we received from all the staff was a holier-than-thou attitude. 

Steak tartare (main course size) was excellent however the rest of the dishes were nothing to write home about. There are a lot of fantastic higher end restaurants in the city, not sure why Canoe always earns top marks (and I've eaten here many many times both for lunches and dinners). Perhaps the media writers suffer from lack of oxygen as the restaurant is literally up in the sky?"}
{"text":"Great lunch option for winterlicious. Recommend the lamb or beef dishes. Gorgeous view makes it a good choice for special occasions. $$$"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. The service and wine were great but the food was pretty average. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?  I got the steak special and it was bland and overdone. The polenta was good. That's about it. There are a lot of restaurants with better food in the city and they aren't as expensive. The view is pretty but I'd prefer to have amazing food and no view over a great view and average food."}
{"text":"We have been several times, and have not been disappointed.  The food is wonderful, the service is excellent and the view is spectacular."}
{"text":"Flawless service.  However the signature duck dish is overrated.  The venison tartar however was incredibly delectable."}
{"text":"Wow!! Went here for my birthday in early November. It was an experience I'll never forget. 

Had oyster appetizer, duck breast and fish for the main course and delicious cake dessert that actually had pop rocks in it. Don't forget to order a nice bottle of wine to wash it all down.

Everything was extremely flavourful and visually appealing just like you see on the Food Network. This was my first time enjoying designer food and it will probably be the last just because it was extremely expensive. Still, it's something everyone must try at least once in a lifetime for a very special occasion.

Very classy atmosphere along with a great view of the city high up in the air. I did notice it was very noisy and it was a Monday night. Don't want to imagine what it's like on a Friday or Saturday night.

In my next life, I'm going back!!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why they continue to win awards at Canoe.

Not priced as a weekly restaurant but definitely for special occasions.

Food and service were both top notch. in fact I would go as far as to say that the service was one of the best if not the best i have ever had. Well done!

If you go in the near future and you like white wines then try the Henry of Pelham 1998 Riesling. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I went to 6 different summerlicious events this year and Canoe gets the top rating. 

My list:
1) Canoe
2) Auberge du Pommier
3) Epic
4) Biff
5) Jump
6) Lucien

Why did Canoe top the list? It excelled on all three fronts:
A) SERVICE
B) AMBIANCE
C) FOOD

Even though we did not reserve a window seat, they obliged when we asked for one. Also, the waiter escorted us around the restaurant when we wanted to take pictures - even offering suggestions for picture locations.

The view was spectacular. I was seated right by the window overlooking the ACC and Hanlan Point (Toronto's Islands). For once, the food had competition: I kept glancing away from my dishes to look at the scenery.

As for the food, I have to admit that it did not make me scream in delight but everything was cooked just right (texture / seasoning / balance). Presentation was killer. The highlight for me was my dessert - it was soooo smooth and delicate. 

I plan to have my AMEX ready for the next *licious event!"}
{"text":"Great food and an amazing view - we highly recommend for a special dinner - make sure you ask for a window side table."}
{"text":"This is by far the best and most consistent restaurant i have ever eaten at. 5 stars on all points from food to service to ambience . It's corporate veneer could be intimidating to some but the service has always been friendly and inviting. The staff is young and enthusiastic about food. Canoe will make you want to learn more about good food ."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the restaurant for lunch on a weekday afternoon for summerlicious. We quickly ordered from the menu. Service was very pleasant but a little on the slow side. Food was good but it did not blow us away. We were slightly surprised by our own reaction because our expectation was very high. We enjoyed our experience although it was a bit of a let down in terms of food and ambiance. Maybe it would have been better if we had dinner instead?"}
{"text":"Manage to get a reservation for their Summerlicious lunch this year. I have been to Canoe before but always try to make use of their summerlicious / winterlicious deals. Service was great but I feel their normal menu tastes better than the Summerlcious menu. Even though you can't beat the price!
The view up there is great so definitely try to call ahead of time and make reservations for the window seats. But beware of foggy and cloudy days cause you won't see a thing...."}
{"text":"Went to Canoe for lunch on a Friday. You will definitely need a reservation, the place was packed. 
I started with the two tone romaine salad which had tons of parmesan cheese and prosciutto, and had actually anchovies (in my opinion the way a real caesar salad should be!). For my main I had the pasta special of the day, which was three large homemade tortellini stuffed with ham and cheese. The entire plate was surrounded with bacon (yum!) and was garnished with mandarins, pecans and the most delicious sauce ever! 
My overall experience was great, the waiters were well informed and attentive. The meal took about 1.5 hours in total and I enjoyed every minute."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends for their Summerlicious 2015 dinner menu. It was quite busy at that time and we arrived early, but we were quickly seated at our table (I also wished the lighting was stronger...but that is their restaurant design). I could not have foreseen it, but when I first saw the food I thought I would be hungry given the small portions (as more expensive restaurants usually give). The food was, however, very filling and savoury. The greatest takeaway from the restaurant experience was the view of the CN tower and city at night (amazing!) and the exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"Amazing food, view, wine, & service.  It is very pricey though.  Expect to pay around $300 for dinner for 2 people."}
{"text":"very simple. you wont go wrong with Canoe. if you like French food you will love this place. very romantic, amazing food, good service."}
{"text":"I went here for Summerlicious 2017.  This place gets BUSY!  When we arrived, we were promptly seated.  The table had a good view of the lake and a partial view of the CN Tower.  Shortly after being seated, our server came by and offered water.  

Complementary bread was provided, accompanied by a chickpea and hummus dip.  It was decent - the bread was fresh, but not warmed.  The dip was made well, but lacked a bit of seasoning.  

Fois gras parfait was great.  It seemed like a very small portion at first, but upon consuming it... I soon realized that it is not something that I would want to consume in large quantities.

Lamb shoulder was my least favorite dish of the 3.  It was deceivingly dry from what seemed to be \"end pieces\" and there was no textural element to the dish.  

Summer berry crumble was as expected.  Fresh fruits and a crumble that was well made.

Overall, the service was great, the food wasn't outstanding ... But if im going there based on its reputation alone, I expected a bit more."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed many breath taking meals at Canoe in the past, only because of winter or summerlicious. Summerlicious this year was particularly memorable due to our fantastic waiter.  Not only was our food amazing as usual, but the waiter we had treated us to complementary dessert wine and spent a lot of time at our table chatting and engaging us. 

It was different than any summerlicious that I have ever been to. Normally the staff is running around like chickens with there heads cut off. This waiter took the time to provide us with a true culinary experience. I had the Goat cheese queich with pickled veggies and the alberta beef. For desert I had the cheese selection, delightful . I left feeling full, surprised by the amazing experience I had and wanting to come back again tomorrow to do it all over again!

See you in the winter Canoe!!"}
{"text":"Irgendwie scheint mir Toronto zu liegen, denn nachdem ich hier meine persönliche Hotelentdeckung (Le Germain, Mercer Street) des Jahres machen durfte, habe ich auch den Genuss gehabt, ein absolut innovatives Restaurant kennen zu lernen.
Positiv: Sehr einfallsreiche Küche. Rentier etwa als Hauptgang perfekt zubereitet oder lokaler Fisch in einer hinreißenden Saucenkombination, spitze! Auch liegt das Canoe im 54. Stock, man hat eine absolut traumhafte Aussicht auf den Ontario-See (perfekte Location etwa, um einen guten Eindruck zu machen). ;-)) Zudem eine Bedienung, die sich echt am Gast interessiert zeigt und auf europäischem Niveau agiert.
Negativ: Die Weinempfehlung des Sommeliers war, nun ja, überraschungsfrei. Und: Das Canoe ist ein Restaurant, das sich ausnahmsweise nicht an nordamerikanischen Grundsätzen orientiert, das heißt, die Teller sind nicht überbordend voll gepackt, so dass sehr gute Esser auf mindestens drei Gänge kommen.
Fazit: Candlelight-Dinner in Toronto? Dann auf jeden Fall hierhin!"}
{"text":"Canoe is at the top of the 54th floor of TD building, and up until today I never realized what a gorgeous view it offers. I've always been seated to the right-hand side after entering the restaurant and definitely been missing out. I had the summerlicious lunch menu which is reasonable price compared to the usual. The appetizers offered was a chilled cucumber soup (I'm not a fan of cold soups), mixed greens (nothing amazing) and the sheep milk mousse (3 tsp of sour fluff, which was not anything special). However, the entree selection were much more satisfying. There was salmon (simply delicious, I love the seasoning on the salmon and the sauce it was drizzled in), the flat iron steak was cooked from medium to rare in layers (the potatoes that accompanied were amazing, even though I am on a non-carbs diet I could have eaten a plate full of that on the side), there was also chicken pasta which I didn't try and can't rate. As for the dessert, there was bread pudding (a bit bland and unsweet, not my cup of tea), mousse cake (I am not a fan of chocolate but I loved it) and a yogurt which I didn't try. On another note, if you order form the main menu, the foie gras is one of the best in Toronto, I'm an addicted to that stuff and always order it when it's on a menu so trust me it's good. lol. Overall, I had a good food experience but the mediocre service provided was disappointing. The servers did not add that personal touch... they didn't explain my food and they checked up on me once, and didn't inquire why I didn't touch my unsatisfying cucumber soup appetizer."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch during the winterlicious 2017, the food is great and service is professional. We would like to go back there again! The view of the Resteruant is super, Unfortunately we didn't get a window table this time."}
{"text":"After researching restaurants in Toronto with a great view, Canoe was one of the top and  indeed it does have a beautiful view ( unless ur back is facing the view lol) but i cant complain i went there for a birthday and unfortunately it wast mine. Make sure you request a window seat and arrive a bit early. 

I cant say that I was very impressed with the food,  expected more from a high end restaurant like Canoe. However the presentation was very impressive. I think if you are celebrating an occasion, this is a great place to come ( or if u want to impress a date). 

Personally i wouldn't  dine at this restaurant again but im glad i tried it at least once after reading such good reviews. The staff was very friendly  and attentive.

Overall, the atmosphere and spectacular view made it a great experience and that's why i gave it a 4 star rating"}
{"text":"great dinner - foie gras  / steak

but ive come here for lunch one time,
and its just disappointing,
the menu is not as fancy but of course the view is excellent."}
{"text":"not bad!
The view is good, only for 1 side though! Their food is pretty expensive and the quality is not crazy, in total not bad for once every few months.
AND Its LOUD! Very LOUD!"}
{"text":"Went to Canoe for Winterlicious. While waiting for our table, my husband had the Caesar at the bar and I got another cocktail, can't remember the name. My cocktail was good, but the Caesar not so much. 

We liked that they did seat us near the window as we had requested on the phone. It was a nice view even though it was foggy and snowing that night. We enjoyed the Winterlicious menu and the service was above average. However maybe it was because my expectations were so high (all my friends had raved about the restaurant), I thought the food was good, but not amazing. I would definitely go for the view, service and food, but unfortunately I was not blown away."}
{"text":"Canoe is the place to take your friends who are financial types.  They will feel totally at ease.  You can eat food that is unabashedly Canadian and enjoy expansive views of the city."}
{"text":"Well worth the Winterlicious price!

I came to Canoe on a weekday evening for Winterlicious. Everything I ordered was plated beautifully and had such unique flavours. I had the Fogo Island Salt Cod + Crab Rillettes to start. I wasn't sure what to expect from this dish, but the flavours and presentation pleasantly surprised me - this was possibly my favourite dish of the 3 courses. The cod and crab were cooked to perfection and paired very well with the roasted dulse mayo. 
For my main, I had the Ontario Beef Tenderloin + Chuck Flat. The preparation and presentation of the chuck flat surprised me - it almost looked like pulled pork and it was so flavourful! On the other hand, I thought the beef tenderloin could have used more flavour, but perhaps it is because the tenderloin is inherently less beefy than other cuts. 
I had the Hewitt's Yoghurt Verrine for dessert. The waiter recommended I mix all of the toppings with the and I did just that. The result was perfect mix of sweet and tarte. 
5 stars for the food. 

In terms of the service, they were very prompt and took the effort to describe all of our dishes to us. The only minor complaint I have is that our apps came a little too fast (maybe 2 minutes after we ordered) and we had to remind the waiter to bring us bread (he said bread would come first right after we ordered). 4 stars for the service."}
{"text":"Not very accommodating. Called twice to confirm i may run late for my reservation. Was assured it wasn't a problem but was turned away at the door. Very unprofessional for such a reputable restaurant."}
{"text":"Great sweeping views and love the open view of the kitchen here! Came here for summerlicious lunch and had a good time at the price although the quality of the food was  less than what I had expected from this restaurant - They were busy at the time, loud restaurant & the service was just average.

I tried the cornish hen terrine  , short ribs, schnitzel, chocolate mousse & panna cotta.  The terrine was easily the worst thing that I ate there it just tasted low quality.  The short ribs & schnitzel were both cooked well and good but again not up to my expectations from what I had heard from this restaurant, chocolate mousse was my favorite thing as the panna cotta was unremarkable. 

I would have loved to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt(because of summerlicious) and give it 4 stars  but I simply can't do it based on my personal experience.  If the quality of the food here isn't any better on the full price menu this place would be highly overrated & overpriced in my opinion"}
{"text":"I was in town for business with my parents and husband and we went here on our one free night. To start off, the views were great, especially during sunset. The ambiance is nice as well.

I had the burrata salad, followed by the lamb saddle. The salad was good, but the lamb was excellent. It was cooked to perfection & the cauliflower puree with it was just delicious. For dessert I had the chocolate & nancy's english mint. This was also fantastic.

All of the other food at our table was spot on - oysters, venison tartare, beef rib eye, and a couple of other desserts.

The meal was extremely expensive, but worth it. The only downside is that the wine is very overpriced, even for a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"Went for business lunch, service was great as usual, food was amazing, food came out relatively fast. Definitely on top of the list for lunch meeting."}
{"text":"Great view of the city, friendly knowledgeable staff, Food presentation was beautifully done. Should be giving them four stars, but the main course was smaller than my appetizer. Leaving hungry -1 star."}
{"text":"Expected much better service, being one of the top restaurants in Toronto... We went for Winterlicious and must say, the food was delicious, except for the stale bread. The waiter was not knowledgeable on the food or the wine, and was rushing. He also only talked to my husband and avoided me, which was weird. There was a hair on my husband's dessert and they did not do anything to make up for it, quickly changed the plate and that's it. We got one of the tables in the small dining room in the back and could not enjoy the famous view, one of us had to face a wall. This was not \"the Canoe experience\" I was hoping for. I might go for the food in the distant future but will not be returning for any of the \"licious\" events."}
{"text":"The best view in the city..... Mary Serniak would love it"}
{"text":"There's a lot to enjoy about with this place. The service was fast and friendly (albeit it didn't feel particularly sincere), the view from the 54th level restaurant offered an expansive view of downtown Toronto, and the whole place had a pretty nice vibe. My friend and I went out here for a 1:30pm, Tuesday reso and it was surprisingly pretty packed.

The food itself was pretty good overall. We tried a lot of things and some of them were great, some, pretty average. The cauliflower and broccoli was honestly a waste of money, it was cold by the time we got it, and it tasted like something you could make in the microwave. The special mushroom soup was pretty good, but it was just missing something. We also go the crab/salmon appi and that one was SO good. Honestly one of the best things I've ever tasted! I got the tuna as a main and that was also to die for. 

I found the service was friendly, but the several servers we had weren't around when we wanted them, and they were a little overly assertive with how they entered our conversations. 

So overall, good experience. Some food was great, some was just okay. The service was friendly, but a little overbearing."}
{"text":"Went to Canoe for Winterlicious this year, and the food ranged from average to great. 

1) Bread and chickpea and garlic puree - your standard restaurant bread, nothing to write home about, chickpea and garlic puree was like a light hummus, nice texture with a smooth consistency but lacked flavor.
2) Roasted Squash & Parsnip Soup  - great, nice texture and flavor, not grainy
3) Duo of Ontario Beef- not good, beef was dry and a bit over cooked, flavors weren't super duper, I saw that there was bone marrow jus for this dish and was pretty excited but tasting it was underwhelming, I tasted zero richness that I would associate with bone marrow, worst dish of the night.
4) Roasted Rock Cornish Hen - tried a bit of my friend's dish and this dish was EXCELLENT, great flavor and perfectly cooked, everyone in the table (n=4) loves it, so mad I got the duo of ontario beef
5) Olive Oil Poached Heritage Salmon - nicely cooked fish, but nothing to write home about, lacks a bit of flavor.
6) Spiced Chocolate Panna Cotta - very nice, great texture, and not too sweet
7) Almond Cake - the cake was a bit dry but the accompanying caramel ice cream was A+++, lovely flavor and the ice cream has nice little crunchy bits in it.

Food was kinda slow to come out but service was polite and non intrusive.

Overall, it was pretty good, some dishes met my expectations of Canoe but some were sore disappointments. Prob more like a 3.5 stars but I will round up cause of the great cornish hen which I know is hard to get perfect and it was pretty perfect and caramel ice cream."}
{"text":"Canoe
Birthday dinner for two. With high expectations we made reservations for a special meal. They accommodated our dessert request with a plate that was inscribed with happy birthday and a lovely sticky toffee pudding that was the highlight of our meal. 
I WANTED TO  START ON A GOOD NOTE BECAUSE THE REST WAS SO UNEVENTFUL!
Walking in to Canoe my impression is that this is a well worn site the floor covering is old and seems torn at the  door way ..The staff are dressed in ridiculous uniforms  that look dated ,the lighting is dim and not in a sexy way and overall the space and furnishings are really nothing special.The view is spectacular. We are seated at an awkwardly long table for two that makes us feel far apart, the room is loud so its not comfortable to hear my partner.
The service is very attentive and our waiter was accommodating  but made no suggestions to the menu.
We start with appetizers a dozen oysters and a venison TarTar The venison is described as being served with bannock  for those of you who get excited  by this yummy warm fried bread creation ..you can relax this version is a minuscule tasteless puffed cracker which i guess matched the tasteless cold venison it accompanied.
The Oysters were presented in a flurry of explanation as to the locale and quality of the mollusk but in reality they were not that tasty, rather average in size and the cucumber relish that comes with it, tasted off.
Moving on we are given a tasty iced granita to clear the palate..an unnecessary edition to justify the high prices maybe?
I order the Bison as a main. At 50$ I expect a spectacular cut of meat and veg I am presented with 3 small  uneven chunks of Grissel filled fibrous meat, the jus is barely there and the vegetable on the plate.. is ...I don't know what it is, its over cooked bits from the bottom of the roasting pan..potato? parsnip? hard to tell.
My partner gets a small piece of salmon nothing special not that tasty also with barely there vegetables i think there was a piece of parsley. All I can say is thank god there was bread on the table and a very nice bean based spread, because this meal was NOT satisfying. 2 glasses of wine and a Caeser and over $240.00.
Really Canoe? Do you think you can get away with this when there are such amazing restaurants in this town? I leave wondering, why do patrons put up with such mediocrity for such a high price?
Big disappointment! We wont be going back or taking our Government business clientele there any time soon."}
{"text":"Sadly my visit to #canoerestaurant was lack luster; see photo. Atop the 54 story #TD Tower in downtown #Toronto the 20+ year old establishment was unable to live up to its reputation. The decor bland and muddy saddled with an open atmosphere giving dinners the impossible task of hearing their company let alone the wait staff; who were by far the best part of the experience. Stringy duck Terrine, chewy pork tenderloin, and smores. If you don't care don't cook. Smores deconstructed for the \"win\". No graham crumble...? Fine.

#Summerlicious #TO we're not off to the best start but I'm happy #Canoe wasn't the finish line. #food #review #averagemikefoodcritic"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there on our first wedding anniversary and ordered a fantastic sparkling wine and tasting menus. To this day we still savour the memory. The service, food and ambiance were superb. The chef even wrote us well wishes in chocolate on our dessert plate."}
{"text":"Amazing view, very professional and attentive serving staff. Food is delicious, although portions are slightly on the small side for the price. Over all this place is great. If you have important meeting or date and want to focus on who is in front of you and not worry about the dining experience, this is the place. They are also really good for food alergies. Our waiter asked at the start, I mentioned no diary. Everything that I ordered from that point came dairy free and he even offered dessert options not on the menu that were dairy free. Very nice!"}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious and didn't think I would like it that much- I thought the portions would be small and the food pretentious. Not the case. Everything was delicious. Strong flavours which I love and great textures. The service was amazing and not too intrusive- Almost makes me want to pay full price...almost"}
{"text":"I travel alone on business weekly.  I am a foodie.  I am also accustomed to getting the traditional looks from the host or hostess when I walk into a restaurant.   No different this time from the full of himself host when he told me that perhaps they would be able to find a seat for me, maybe, in the bar.  This time though the very pretty hostess, who had the right to be full of herself but was not, took over, looked me in the eye and said, sir we can take care of you.  I sat down, had a wonderful view looking over the lake and the sky tower, had a very accomodating waiter and enjoyed a great meal.  Food was very well done with lots of varied flavors on the plate.  I splurged but one would not necessarily have to and my check was just over $100 for the few hours I enjoyed.  My rateing tells you to go, I hope my words are seen by the hosts for future training.  A business traveler dining alone can be a very good source of revenue for a business.  I will return and perhaps bring clients next time...  You'll enjoy the food for sure.  I think you will have a good experience with the service too, once you get to your table.  To the hostess that \"welcomed me and gave me a smile on the way in and the way out, Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went to Canoe for Summerlicious for few years in a row, this year the food is probably not the best I have tried but I wasn't disappointed.   It's just an absolute bargain for the spectacular view along with the quantity of food and services you get in Canoe.  Also, if you are able to book it on a weekend, your parking is validated for the whole day.  

* Chilled Cucumber & Melon Soup
- I like cucumber, so I find the soup very refreshing and delicious.  The best chilled soup I had in Canoe was the Chilled Summer Sweet Pea Soup with Buttermilk & Dungeness Crab.

* Potted Rainbow Trout
- I tried a small portion of this, it was ok but not very special.

* Tree Syrup Rubbed Bison Short Rib
- The ribs are tender and the meat do fall off the bones.  The taste of the Bison Ribs are more robust than the classic beef ribs.  However, personally I prefer the taste of beef ribs better than Bison rib.

* Hewitt's Dairy Buttermilk & Lemongrass Flan
* Sablé Breton
* Coffee Chocolate Gâteau
- Desserts are the highlight for me in this meal, I found the Sablé Breton the best one among the 3. In general, they are all pretty good."}
{"text":"I had the prix fixe $100 and was kind of disappointed. I went around November when they still had a thanksgiving-y theme going and picked the turkey (over the duck) as my main. I know turkey is generally lean and can be dry, but I expected more from Canoe, and immediately had \"Orderer's Remorse\" and wish I had the duck. Personally, this is the worst reaction I can have during a dinner - especially a relatively pricier one. Everything up to the main dish was really good, so it's a shame that my main overshadowed the rest of what was otherwise a 4/5 rating dinner. 

My favourite of the meal were the chicken soup and the scotch egg. The scotch egg came with a pate like dish, which I thought was very underwhelming but the scotch egg was delicious. 

Dessert was fun and creative but the dry turkey dish really ruined the meal for me. 

As with all the other reviews here, yes the atmosphere and service is amazing, but I cannot fairly give a 4 or 5 star rating based on amazing service. There is a previous reviewer that mentioned Canoe's inconsistent quality. We went on an extremely busy night so I understand that \"shi* happens\" - but I don't foresee myself giving them another chance any time soon, considering how many other great restaurants there are in Toronto."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. Great food and service, not to mention the view."}
{"text":"Nice view, average tasting food but with good presentation, good service, signature cocktails--not good"}
{"text":"I'm extremely surprised at the quality of the food.  First, the view is gorgeous.  You'll have amazing panoramic views of the CN tower and surrounding cityscapes.  The atmosphere at night is very chique.  Everyone is dressed up and there is beautiful low light that will make anyone look great on a date ;)

When the servers bring out your food, they'll take time to give you a detailed explanation of the dish.  It seems everything on the menu uses local ontario ingredients.

I had the hogtown pork dish.  It was phenomenal - the flavours are incredibly intricate yet not overwhelming.  Stacking the legumes, sauce and vegetables on the pork and tasting it all at once creates an overwhelming sensation of different flavours and textures.  It was quite honestly the best pork chop in my life.

The mushroom that I ordered on the side was a little too salty for my liking though.

Regardless the overall experience was nice, not pretentious, and incredibly tasty."}
{"text":"all optics, great view and a place to see and be seen,  food mediocre, much of ours was overcooked,  service was poor.  and it was not just our table of six, friends had a totally separate table and had the same bad experience.  if you are a foodie, toronto has good places to graze.  this is not one."}
{"text":"The location and view was awesome. 
I'm not so sure whether it is because we ordered wintericious menu, but the food itself was not so impressive. 
The most annoying thing is service. The server dropped the spoon and bread knife twice, and he explained nothing about the menu but to just tell us \"enjoy\". 
I'm strongly doubtful that I would visit this place again."}
{"text":"Fab from start to finish
Staff: 5
Food: 5
Atmosphere: 5

Oysters, Salmon, Cheese - all 3 courses were special."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome experience. I was pleasantly surprise they were opened on Sunday for mothers day, which happen to be my 1yr anniversary. Score! Canoe on weekend!

The service was exceptional, very attentive staffs. And, the food is spectacular. 

Starter: The fois gras with \"peanut butter\" and \"jam\". I appreciate the creativity but I thought the peanut was a bit overwhelming. The salmon was very moist and full of flavor.

Main: Tea- infused duck breast is the moistest and tastiest duck I ever had. It was a exceptional dish. Lamb was tendered as expected but the duck take the cake.

Dessert: Lemon meringue. The crust was abit too hard. But the lemon was just the right amount of tartness and sweetness.

Dinner for two with a bottle of  sparkling was about $270. Not bad for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing special, the decor needed a lot of improvement specially for fine dining, but the service was worse than everything. Our waiter was as snobbish as they come, it took him a good 5 mins to refill my wine glass, and then when the food came we asked for different knives because the ones we had couldn't cut through our steak, but the waiter responded \"what do you want me to do? these are our sharpest knives\"!!!! All and all the experience left a bitter taste in my mouth"}
{"text":"This place is always busy (and for good reason) so reservations are a must.  The portion sizes are about what you'd expect at any fancy restaurant but that's ideal for me since I usually end up taking part of my meal home when I eat out! The view is amazing.. and how can it not be when you're on the 54th floor, facing lake Ontario?  
There's a great selection of wines in all price ranges (from about $40/bottle to $2000! if you happen to have a little extra \"pocket change\").  And of course a nice selection of really original desserts.  Nice place for a dinner date, business lunch, or a birthday with friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic view. Amicble servers. 
Great and delicate food. Reasonably priced tasting menu"}
{"text":"So many years each visit after another and the restaurant is still one of my top picks.  Not to mention the view, the service and last but not the least its food consistently maintain its standard throughout lunch and dinner. Not matter why this is the rendezvous for those in financial district after work.

The Summerlicious menu is not spectacular this year but you have to say its presentation is fabulous.  I have a overrun meeting and cannot enjoy this nice restaurant fully.  So I can only have a very short and fast meal with the party members arrive much earlier and stay after I left.  Good for them.  I have to attend another meeting !

The BBQ Trout Escabeche is a few amuse-bouche of BBQ Trout on top.  It is dinky and sparsely spreaded across my dish.  Did it entice my taste bud - I am just too rush.  All I remember is the BBQ smell of Trout in my mouth.  Wait for the next dish.

The entrée is Bison Bavette & Short Rib.  I enjoyed the meat is cooked as per my expectation medium rare but my piece just got too much fat in it.  I admired the others having a perfect piece.  Am I that lucky

The dessert is the Hewitt's Dairy Buttermilk & Lemongrass Flan.  Surprisingly this dish catches my most attention.  Not only is the Flan soft as silk and melt in your mouth, the berry sauce actually gives it a boost.

It's time to run. What a waste not to enjoy more in the restaurant and with my parties !  Try it again next time"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype on this place.

Nothing wowed me, is it the far wall that was recently renoed, or the view of the gardiner expressway? or being on the 54th floor?  

for years I've heard about this legendary place.. but sadly I have to say it was not up to my expectations.

The food, main course pork tenderloin was melt in your mouth good, same with the butternut squash soup delicious, the dessert - a bread pudding was disappointing cold, tasted straight out of the fridge. . 

Food was excellent (portion a bit on the small side), price way above average, atmosphere a disappointment."}
{"text":"It was amazing.  I felt spoiled rotten by the service. My mouth watered for more after we finished the food.  I wanna go back today!  And tomorrow.  Oh, and..."}
{"text":"Part of my reasoning for selecting this restaurant was for the location - and I must say, the view of the Toronto skyline sincerely adds to the picturesque dining experience of Canoe. Best preparation of foie gras I've ever had. The restaurant décor was beautiful and modern, as were the food preparations. I sincerely look forward to returning again."}
{"text":"If you are like me, and had no idea where this place is, it is a pain in the ass to find. However, the service is very friendly, the view is fantastic, and the food is near as good as some of the top restaurants I've been to. Very good indeed."}
{"text":"A terrific upscale restaurant, I've enjoyed it every time I've been there. Excellent food, a terrific wine list, and impeccable service make this one of the best places in town."}
{"text":"Went here with very high expectations after finding luma a bit dissapointing. 

-Service was a bit sluggish and inattentive at times. Examples: it took the waiter 25 mins before taking our order. And after explaining to one waiter we dont consume pork we receive a bread basket that half of was a pork and potato bread. Also my mothers dessert had tons of gelatin. 

-One rookie error service made was serving our coffees before dessert (about 10 minutes before). it surprised everyone at the table but we didnt make a big deal out of it

-the food was decent, i felt like i should have been much more impressed though. i found some dishes much stronger than others. the smoked duck breast was phenomenal , yet the wagyu tri tip was very rubbery and underseasoned..Its odd that the dessert was the strongest course of the night to be honest. It wasnt that the meals were not enjoyable , it just didnt have the \"oomph\" we were expecting from one of canadas finest restaurants.

- the ambience is really nice, absolutely beautiful restaurant 


overall a nice place to go to impress. The service although a bit slow was not poor by any means. I just think the food needs a bit more oomph in certain areas, as mentioned some dishes are way stronger than others, that it almost feels like it was from a different restauraunt .

We all found the butter tart for dessert way too sweet , that was probably the only dish we couldnt really finish due to us not liking it. However the chocolate mousse, on hazelnut sponge cake wiht jasmine ice cream and the peanut butter banana angel food cake desserts were absolutely divine.. 

Honestly the food was just slightly better than lumas (minus the desserts, which were so impressve). Granted it was presented alot nicer and on paper sounds fantastic but the execution needs a bit of refinement. 


All in all a lovely evening, i would certainly recommend this place but perhaps not to a super foodie. personally i think its a bit of an overstretch to call this one of canadas finest , in my humble opinion.  I would most certainly give them another chance in the future."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant during Summerlicious and it was the best $25 dollars I've ever spent on a meal.

We went for the lunch menu and I ordered the green bean soup puree, with a medium done steak and dessert.

The green bean soup puree was very light and refreshing something that opened the palate for the fantastic steak that followed with a red reduction sauce.  The dessert was a fruit tarte which was given in the right quantity to finish of the meal.  

Will definitely be visiting this place again soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing views....of food!!. Yes it does have a great view but the food was great. We came here on our Honey Moon weekend. The service was spot on and the food was platted perfectly. We ordered the Maple Salmon starter. This was cured then torched on the outside. Great flavor! for our main we had the lamb three ways. Lamb was from Alberta and had amazing flavor and ate like butter. The pork chop was our second main and it had great fat to lean ratio and also ate very tender. Although it was a bit pricey, it is well worth the level of service and execution that you receive. You will be taken care of here and you won't leave hungry and in search of a pizza after dinner."}
{"text":"Canoe is one of my favorite restaurants in North America! Great food, staff and view!  Not inexpensive but not a total ripoff like some trendy NYC or LA foodie locales.  I have done a formal meal in a private function area as well as casual snacks and drinks in the bar.  Both environments are fun and fulfilling!"}
{"text":"Excellent views. Good food. Friendly staff. Extensive wine cart from all over the world"}
{"text":"A pleasant experience in our vacation. We come again! Tasty and great service. We have well filled us very. Unfortunately's goes back again ... Until next time!"}
{"text":"Possessing a refined ambiance with a view to match, Canoe truly deserves its well earned reputation among Toronto's top restaurants.  

Enjoyed the tasting menu in a medium sized group of nine. Staff were clearly well trained, took their jobs seriously, and possessed detailed knowledge on all that was brought to the table. 

The standout dish to several at the table was the Apple Cider Sorbet which, though when cut effortlessly with a spoon seems at first almost ephemeral, transforms in your mouth into a perfectly harmonious composition of flavour and texture dialled all the way up to 11. 

My single-star-lowering gripe is that though we said we were not in a hurry that evening, the kitchen seem to interpret this as though we wished to spend the entire night there. Our 6:30 dinner took four and a half hours to complete. 

Overall a very positive experience, would certainly recommend."}
{"text":"Un restaurant comme Canoe, c'est une fois dans la vie pour un grand événement. Situé au 54e étage d'un immeuble du quartier financier, le restaurant est tout ce qu'il y a de plus chic à Toronto. Vous y dépenserez une somme folle, mais que de souvenirs à la clef si vous êtes avec de bons amis. Envoyez paître le sommelier, il vous proposera un vin qui ira à merveille avec votre plat mais avec un prix qui ressemblera à un numéro de téléphone ..."}
{"text":"Food was good, view was amazing. Service was meh, not the best but passable. A bit overpriced for the food but it's more of the atmosphere and view."}
{"text":"I don't want to write this review because I don't want to be reminded of how delicious that Atlantic fluke ceviche was and I don't want to crave it like how I've been thinking about it non-stop for the past two days.

Canoe: you've all already heard it, so I'll try to keep this one short and informative. It was my birthday and they gave us a city view, which was beautiful. The customer service was professional and genuine. They were all nice people, except for our main server. I don't want to name any names but you know who you are, Rick. I'm gonna take a stab in the dark and say it was because of our age. Standing at 22 years each, my boyfriend and I were the youngest table that night.

Food was delicious. Some people may say it's overrated but they have a reputation for a reason. Boyfriend got the lamb (recommend), I got the tea-smoked duck breast (recommend) with the shared ceviche as a starter (10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND).

Not that we expected it or wanted it, nothing was brought out to commemorate the birthday, despite the insistence from my boyfriend that he told them a million times in the reservation. Maybe it's because we didn't order dessert? That's okay, I had a great time with great food and better company!

Note: having left a fairly generous tip, I'm hoping it didn't all go to Rick (but rather shared among the other servers as well) because he was kind of a word that rhymes with his name. Perhaps he was having a bad night."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place.  \"Local\" food served in the top floor of a high rise overlooking the lake and part of the city.  The waitstaff were very friendly and I liked the decor.  However, the food, although very good, does not live up to the hype of being the best restaurant in Toronto, unless you are basing on factors other than food.  This place is inventive and more of a culinary and visual treat than a place to whet your appetite. Therefore, I give only three stars. If you want a \"taste of Canada\", eat here. If you want to enjoy your \"food\", you may want to go somewhere else as this place is more for those in it for the experience (at least it must be as the food wasn't wow)."}
{"text":"Best desserts I've had in my life. Compliments to the pastry chef! I ordered the cod for the main dish, it was waay too salty for my taste. However, it was a good dining experience with great views. At the end however, the waiter input the tip percentage for us. I'm not sure if the tip percentage is already predetermined as there were a few other options but I found him pushy. He caught me looking at it and replied quickly \"it's correct.\" Shouldn't the customer be the judge of that?"}
{"text":"In the heart of the Toronto, on top of the city, with spectacular view and exquisite cuisine. Great customer service."}
{"text":"I have always found Canoe to hit it out of the  park on my 4 main criteria: food, drinks, service and atmosphere.

For this particular visit I was accompanied by my mentor so we enjoyed some excellent red wine and a seafood platter in the lounge area.  I have had cocktails here before, and they are legit, so if you are in the core and looking for good cocktails in a very impressive setting (54 floors above the street) this is where to come.

The platter was also excellent and included shrimp, scallops, lobster and noodles, tuna tartare and some oysters!  As would be expected the staff were attentive and knowledgeable, explaining where all of the wonderful good was coming from.

As mentioned, the atmosphere here was amazing. The restaurant is high end and it is apparent from all of the furnishings and the fixtures, all of which is of course underscored by the city view."}
{"text":"I went there for summerlicious.  The view was phenomenal but service was lowly for a restaurant of that class. 

Food:
Nothing to rave about.  The chilled soup was awful.  Tasted like someone put cucumbers into the magic bullet then poured it into a bowl.  To top it off when we got to the bottom of the bowl, there was a curly hair in it (VOMIT).  We also had some of the trout which was alright.  The main, I had the bison and short rib.  The bison was really good and cooked medium rare/rare.  The dessert was nothing spectacular.  Petit gateau was just 3 little chocolate brownies. 

Service:
The hostesses were friendly and escorted us to our table promptly.  When we found the curly hair in our appetizer we told the waiter and he said \"it doesn't change the taste of the food.\"  What an awful joke.  No one laughed.  Then he said \"just joking.\" He then apologized and the next course came.  Then we called the manager over and he told us he was aware of the situation and that he would give us some extra desserts.  The apologetic desserts were some white jello thing that tasted just as bad as the soup.  We took one bite and didn't finish it.  The waiter and manager were not very genuine with their apologies and the curly hair made me sick all dinner. I asked another waiter for directions to the bathroom and he didn't even look at me when he answered \"hold on, I'll tell you in a minute.\"  The tone and attitude from some of the people here is goddamn awful and they're just lacking basic human manners.

Ambiance: 
Great view of Toronto and romantic setting.  Restaurant's decor is lovely as well.

I don't think I will ever come back here.  This experience is very discouraging and the view or food does not make up for the poor service."}
{"text":"Holy hell the view is stunning here!  Not just the lofty Lake-view perspective from the top of TD Tower, but also the spectacle of the inner workings of its kitchen, which is visible from the dining room.  

The wait staff is also first-class.  Extremely professional and courteous though I sometimes could sense that they are screaming on the inside.  Perhaps it is because they must always maintain an atmosphere of calm, even in the face of fickle clientele and kitchen mishaps. 

Our dinner was botched when our waiter forgot that breadcrumbs were in the topping of the dish that my friend ordered (Sara has severely allergic reactions to wheat products).  Even though our waiter was informed about Sara's condition, she just didn't have the the FULL list of ingredients memorized--something that could have been mitigated with a quick fact-check in the kitchen.  

Apart from this small snafu, which had us eating at separate times, we enjoyed the experience with the staff.  Our waiter apologized a million times over, the food bearers were prompt to describe each dish in detail, and our coats were handled so smoothly that we hardly noticed their absence and return.  

As for the meal: the foie gras on my monkfish melted like butter.  But that's all I remember.  

It seems that the view, ambience, and customer service trumped my memories of the food!"}
{"text":"Canoe is the one place I'd say that has a very consistent quality of food and presentations.The staffs are well trained, the service is possibly the best I've experience in Toronto. 

Will go again like I did for the last 10 years."}
{"text":"Usually when I'm visiting a city I'm not familiar with, I like to check out which restaurants are the most booked or fit for foodies on OpenTable.com. I remember Canoe coming up and stating that it was Canadian fare. After looking at the menu I knew this was the place I was searching for. 

When you first get to the top of the building, you feel like you are part of an exclusive club, the space is very welcoming, airy yet intimate at the same time. There aren't as many tables as I had expected but that's usually a plus. 

We started off with a nice bottle of wine and the Seafood appetizer that came in huge clam. Everything on that clam was delicious and fresh. The shrimp, lobster and oyster tasted as they had just come out of the water 1 minute ago. I ordered the bison steak which was delicious and my dining companion ordered the rack of lamb. Nothing in this place was average. You could tell there was a lot of attention in the preparation of all the dishes that were served to us. Canoe is one of those places that you pay top dollar for but you leave with a big smile knowing you paid for what you got. This was a fantastic dining experience and any foodie that's in Toronto must try this place out.

#summerlicious 2017
The Famed Canoe. I've always wanted to come, and the closest I got was the elevator last time. So, this became my second pick for summerlicious this year, got lunch for $28 plus a drink on the side. 
It was a great day, when you look down you can see the city, blue lake, white sails, blue sky, skyscrapers... Seriously, the view itself was worth the price. The service was so warm and welcoming that I tipped entirely out of sincerity, not because I was obligated. The one thing I wasn't prepared for was the size of the meal, I've seen entrees bigger than all 3 courses combined here!! I'd say this was more of a culinary experience, than a place you'd actually wanna go if you're hungry.
Appetizer - duck liver parfait with roasted Ontario peach (4.5/5.0) I loved the flavor, I loved the combination. The peach was so good that I can still taste the freshness despite it's grilled. However, the flavor of the peach was so distinctive that it sometimes conflicted with the parfait instead of acting as one entity. But definitely fun, and very enjoyable:)
Main - braised lamb shoulder with pea puree (3.5/5.0) The lamb was cooked to perfection, soft and right off the bone. However, the flavor kind of fell flat, there just wasn't enough layers and complications. The addition of the pea puree was genius though -- I swear this course tastes like spring!! If you don't know what spring tastes like, go try this;)
Dessert - mint chocolate brownie (1.5/5.0) Again, rating is solely based on personal preference. Another person might have thoroughly enjoyed it, but for me it was just way too sweet and way too heavy. I did enjoy the single chocolate crisp on top, and kinda wished my entire dessert was comprised of that instead:(
Drink - stawberry vodka (2.0/5.0) I don't even know about this one... I think my drink was supposed to have vodka in it? But I didn't taste any alcohol, just the strawberries...? Well, at least it makes good pictures;)
Overall this was a great dining experience, and I would recommend this place anytime, to anyone. Everything was pleasant, the service, the ambience, the view, the music, the food...okay maybe not dessert. But still. The reason I'm taking a star off is because nothing particularly stood out, food-wise there weren't any 'wow' factors. Canoe is like the kid who always gets straight A's that when he does it again, no one is even surprised anymore. And that's what makes an A-list restaurant: quality and consistency:)"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long time. Amazing food and service, just a shame that we weren't seated by the windows for the view. O&B never disappoint!"}
{"text":"We came to Canoe to on Saturday night for a 7:30 reservation for 5 to enjoy our reservation for winterlicious menu. Only hiccup to our experience at canoe was having to wait 45 minutes for our window table that had been requested in advance,but while we waited we were shown to the bar area to enjoy a drink. The bartender was really knowledgable as well especially when it came to wines allowing us to sample few. When we were seated we treated to gorgeous view of Toronto. 
Our waiter was Radic but if your dinner service was horrible he goes by Peter. He was on point the whole night dealing with all the dad jokes at the table, and our questions about items on the menu. 
One person at our table choose the wine pairings, and said each one went perfectly with her courses. We tried all of the appetizers between the five of us were really impressed. For entrees three of us had the strip lion, and other two had lamb. Sign the steak will be amazing is when it doesn't require a steak knife! Dessert was my favourite part I had the pumpkin caramel cake it which was amazing. Only critique to the menu is one person at our table didn't like the apple dessert as it was quite the texture change throughout it. 
All and all Canoe made my 25th birthday celebration there one to remember! I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. The views are amazing, the service is spectacular, and the food is indescribable. There's really nothing bad I can say about this place. Maybe the price, but it's definitely worth every penny. I hear they do weddings, so I'm definitely looking out for this one."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our 3rd year anniversary. We first sat at the bar while our table was being set up since we came a little bit early. We sat by the window so the view was spectacular during night time. We got the seafood platter for two (half-sized) and that was SO delicious. It was fun to try each dish and pop a popcorn in to neutralize the palette. 

We then each had our own mains, equally delicious, paired with red wine. The service was impeccable, they knew when to give us space and when to provide service. They were genuinely passionate about the food that they were serving and making as each waiter/staff knew the ingredients, where it came from and how it was cooked. 

I highly recommend coming here for that special night with your significant other!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a definite must try. We Visited Canoe last night and was thoroughly impressed with the food, service and total experience. The view of the \"6\" from the 54th floor was breathtaking in the as the lights lit the city up beautifully and the overall ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant and laid back. 

The server was very attentive and well timed in his check ins throughout dinner. The servers' introduction to the dishes when they were brought to our table was a very nice touch and added another dimension to the service. Zero complaints about the service. 

Now for the pinnacle of the experience - the food. Came here with no expectations but was so impressed with the quality and flavour of the dishes. From the appetizer to dessert, every course  felt like a party in my mouth. The chefs do an amazing job of marrying different flavours; sweet, savoury, together in a dish. Every bite was different and a new experience. Definitely memorable. The menu is not extensive but definitely one of a kind. There are plenty of meat based dishes on the menu, so it may not appeal too much the vegetarian population, however the restaurant seems very accommodating and I'm sure would not have issue tweeking any dishes to meet individual dietary needs. It's something to try at least once in one's lifetime. The food was also nicely presented on the dish. Portions where very reasonable and food was filling and leaves you feeling content. The goat milk cheesecake is one of a kind!!! 

Only downfall is the price tag... A meal for two people will easily fall within the $150-250 price range, however you get what you pay for - a gorgeous view, great service, quality dishes and a unique experience. Perfect place to go for a celebratory meal with someone special."}
{"text":"Great view great location! Food is normally expensive here but we got a great deal during Winterlicious."}
{"text":"First, I have to comment on the service, because it was truly remarkable. For such a swanky place, the service was completely unpretentious. Rather, our server was friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and made both myself and my dining companion very comfortable. I had no feeling of stuffiness, which is rare for a place like this. And the view! As soon as the sun set, the servers lined up across the windows and simultaneously pulled the set of curtains up to reveal a stunning view of Toronto.

Now, on to the food. I regret not writing this review closer to my actual visit here, because I can't remember the names of the dishes I had, and the menu seems to have changed since my visit. I'll try to describe everything as best I can.

My amuse was a wonderful white fish mousse served with little chips, fresh green peas, and a drizzle of flavourful olive oil. While fish mousse is not a thing that generally appeals to me, this was so delicious. I would love to see it in a larger appetizer portion.

My partner had pristinely fresh oysters, and I had a lovely, creamy soup (I believe it was an artichoke base), poured over a meltingly tender slice of pork belly. I had seared duck with barley for my main- the duck was beautifully seasoned and cooked, but I found the grains slightly undercooked.

I had a small cake for my birthday dessert- it was delicious, but not all that remarkable as cakes go. 

Overall, this was a wonderful restaurant experience. Despite a couple of slight misses, the food was very much worth the price tag, and I would come back without hesitation."}
{"text":"I should start by saying I went last summer (new to yelp), but had to give my review on this great restaurant.

I am a student, so fine dining experiences are a rare occasion for me.  I decided to choose this location because I love a good visit to Toronto and who would want to see the gorgeous view on a beautiful day.  Additionally, the menu looked wonderful.

I reserved online a week ahead of time, requesting a window table with a view of the CN Tower and lake Ontario.  We were given the closest 2-seated table to this corner of the restaurant, so this was perfect.  The staff were wonderful to my guest and me, even with our young age - which is uncommon at more high-end restaurants (and immediately ruins the grandness of the experience).

As for the food.  It was delicious, and uncommon.  We ordered the special appetizer of the night, which happened to be a duck \"head to tail\" (more-or-less what they called it).  It was the best part of the meal.   I had a venison dish, and it was also lovely.  During the meal we had wine (not a wine-o, so couldn't tell you more on that), and I also had a whiskey.  Drinks were very good.

Overall, great dining experience, one of my best, and certainly my favorite so far (that view was wonderful)."}
{"text":"Went here for a wedding. Talk about top notch! Great service, all servers are experienced and really caring. I don't usually go to places like this, but very enjoyable, I didn't feel out of place. Also WHAT A VIEW! Great view of the lake, ACC and lots of major buildiings of T.O. Would go back again if I was rich. :)"}
{"text":"Disappointing both food and service, judged based on the menu price. Service is way too casual and unorganized. Our waitress seem to be uninterested.  Food wise, we ordered the raw platter and wagyu tri tips. Raw platter was interesting with a wide selection of sea food, all very fresh. Wagyu tri tip was not good. Three of us all ordered rare. The edge of the meat are cooked medium which can be understandable. The meat is not as tender and flavor is not there. The three thin slices of king oyster mushroom is probably the best part of the dish. Two of us did not enjoy our tri tip at all. Well one of us thought it was good. Possible variation in cut here, but unacceptable non the less in a restaurant like this. Waitress did not ask whether the meet is cooked to our liking. We lost interest at this point and only ordered one dessert to share. Ordered Date Crumble. It was ok. 

Ambience wise, the restaurant can be quite noisy. We arrived at 9:15pm on a Wednesday and the place is full. View of the city is nice in the restaurant. They have a nice bar with what seemed to be more friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went for my anniversary with my bf and ordered their Halibut and Beef Steak plate for dinner. Halibut was very soft and had no fishy smell. The steak was little touch to chew but tasty. They also gave us complimentary dessert with happy anniversary written down for us. Little too much of our server coming to our table asking us if we wanted a wine for our evening. We asked for a quiet dinner.. overall our experience was satisfied."}
{"text":"Unlike the many beautiful pictures posted by an unknown yelper here, my expectation about Canoe was unreasonable. 

First, I don't drink so asked if they have non-alcohol drink, waiter told me they had a peach, pear, and apple concoction as if it was the only option. I felt pushed because of the fact that there was the only one drink to choose for me (well is this waiter like this all the time when someone doesn't prefer wine? Or was it my bad hair after a busy Friday? Yes yes I didn't have time to make my hairstyle look different from a very simple up-do bun hair..!) but ordered it with a hint of apple cider vinegar for digestion. A glass of pre-made fruit purée arrived with the vinegar on top, not even stirred. So my first sip was like drinking 100% apple cider. Why? The waiter told me he poured one teaspoon on top (when I asked how much vinegar was in it out of the shock, and was asked if I would like without the apple cider then.) so I was told that I had to mix it well with the straw he would bring soon. Meaning my non-alcohol drink was pre-made and they didn't bother mixing and tasting before serving it. Being uncomfortable with what's happening, I asked him if he tasted it before serving it to me. He said no!! Wow isn't Canoe a highly reviewed restaurant in Toronto?

So we switched to a table in a different section in order not to see and tip the same waiter for the rest of the evening. But the second waiter was somewhat rigid probably because of what the first waiter's saying to his colleagues about our table. (So what?) We ordered seafood platter for two, tea-smoked duck breast, pan roasted Northern mushroom, and Alberta lamb. All were not memorable at all except fresh oysters with grated horse radish. Tea-smoked duck breast was disappointing. It was smelly at the end, maybe not fresh. Also the two mains tasted like they were cooled completely and then warmed up again instead of being cooled down after freshly cooked (because of the hard texture of the meat in both dishes even though they were supposed to be succulent medium rare). It made me miss the delish duck dishes I've had in Montreal restaurants such as PDC, Le Club Chasse et Peche, Le St-Urbain, Toque, Maison Boulud, etc. How I miss Montreal's great food!! Skipping desserts, we decide to tell all our friends not to come here unless they want expensive meals served by the pretentious and stuffy staff for the great view :P"}
{"text":"I heard Canoe was one of the best restaurants in Canada, so I just had to try it.  In addition, Canoe has a focus on regional cuisine, which draws me in like a moth to a flame.  Fortunately, I was already in Toronto :).  After actually dining there, I do hope that Canadian food catches on in Atlanta.  We already have a restaurant called Canoe, so they'll have to call it Rowboat.  Hey, a girl can dream.

Almost every seat in the house is great.  From the 54th floor of the TD Bank Tower building, you can see across the city.  What a sleek, cosmopolitan feel!  This is Toronto from its best angle.  Inside the restaurant, the decor is sophisticated and simple with a warm modern disposition.  

Canoe has a focused menu -- plenty of regional (or at least national) cheeses, seafood, interesting red meats, and seasonal veggies.  Here, the Canadian bent seems to make perfect sense and detracts from nothing.  The platings are just lovely.  One in our group had an octopus dish that was right out of Michel Bras' playbook.  I enjoyed a rather simple fish that was perfectly delicious, though I do regret not splurging for the tasting menu.  Seriously, when the chef has this much artistry and clarity, it's worth it.  Canoe's food was approachable even by those in our group with less of a fine dining focus, which speaks again to the talent and vision of the chef, Anthony Walsh.

Service was attentive and well executed, but most of all, the staff had a genuine attitude of pride towards the food they served.  It was easy to tell from their descriptions and mannerisms that they thought the food was amazing, and I'm sure that contributed to my judgement.

Yes, the food is expensive.  I'm sure the rent and ingredients are too.  At some point, when you're evaluating fine dining, it's art!  I'll always remember this dinner and hope to return for the tasting menu.

So, is Canoe the best restaurant in Canada?  It offers my favorite straight culinary experience in Toronto, with Opus being my actual favorite restaurant.  Restaurants with great views have a tendency to offer mediocure food and become tourist traps, but this is the opposite.  I highly recommend Canoe to both locals and tourists."}
{"text":"Canoe is the one restaurant that participates in Summerlicious that never fails to disappoint me. The food is always creative, fresh, and tasty. And the view is always nice, even if it's not nice outside.  The service is always excellent, and the decor of the restaurant is natural and pleasant. I'd be hard pressed to find a fault with this restaurant. I guess the most I can say is that it's expensive, but I think it's worth the price for the combined food and dining atmosphere."}
{"text":"Late review. Indulged here for dinner during Winterlicious 2014! I've never been here before that so I'm not sure how they are on a regular basis with a regular menu. Needless to say, it is on the pricier end. 

To start off, the ambience and atmosphere is lovely! Really nice for a special occasion - the view more than makes up for the corporate feel of the TD Tower. 

When we arrived (party of 4 - two couples), our table wasn't ready. They took our coats and suggested we wait in the bar area. That was fine. We grabbed a table and enjoyed the view while sipping on our drinks. They had 4 beers on hand and we ordered one of each. Nothing memorable, the usual Steamwhistle etc. 

We were then taken to our table about 15 minutes later. We were served an amuse bouche of bread and condiments - tasty but unmemorable. 

Here is what we ordered: 

- Butternut Squash Soup 
- Cured Rainbow Trout
- Pork Terrine 
- Roasted Chicken  
- Braised Beef Ribs/Steak 
- Carrot Cake 
- Three Milk Cake  (I think) 

The soup was alright - it tasted something like my mom makes at home; good, but nothing spectacular. The trout was sashimi style. I found the portion rather small, but it was tasty. Again, it didn't stand out for me. My SO was the only one who ordered the pork terrine, and I found it absolutely phenomenal! He said it tasted like fish or SPAM, but I personally loved both the texture and flavour and the accompanying fruity condiments. 

The roasted chicken was fabulous! I adored every bite - 2 of us got this dish and we both loved it. The chicken was so soft and tender, the sauces were flavourful and complimented the dish well, and the vegetables and I believe wild rice or risotto, were a nice touch. It was perfect! Again, the portion was on the smaller end, but alongside the appetizer, I was getting full by this point. My SO and the other diner got the beef dish. It came with a braised short rib and mashed potatoes. Wow. This dish was out of this world! We all loved the beef and it was done to a perfect medium/medium-rare. 

The carrot cake was perfect and my only complaint was that I wished the portion was bigger. The cream cheese 'icing'  they served alongside it was absolutely heavenly. My SO got the three milk cake, I believe. I wasn't a huge fan. It wasn't terrible, but it did not stand out to me. 

Service was flawless - our water glasses were kept full, the servers were gracious and unpretentious. One of them even noticed us trying to take pictures and offered to take one of the group for us! They were friendly and very precise - they cleared our tables with manners and skill. No complaints with them. 

Presentation was top notch. Everything came looking extremely pretty. Our only complaint was that we wished the portions were a little bigger. The two males in our group noted that they could go for another round of the entrees. I was moderately full - if my dessert had been even 1/2 a size bigger, I would have reached that mark. My other friend, who is a very light eater, was completely satisfied. 

All in all, I loved my experience at Canoe. I think I would definitely go back to try their regular menu, however, it is quite pricey, so perhaps for a special occasion. The entrees were quite truly amazing, and the desserts satisfying. The appetizers have potential, but could use some work. Maybe we are big eaters or it was simply Winterlicious, but I believe the portions could have been slightly larger. 

Definitely recommend this place though!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant if you're looking to celebrate a special occasion or just splurge once in a while. Each time I've been here the service has been exceptional; attentive (but not overly so) and very friendly. The space is clean + beautifully decorated and it probably has one of the best, if not THE best, views of the city. It's especially lovely just before sunset and into the evening. I find the portions are a bit on the smaller side given the cost...but then again you don't really expect to get a plate heaped with food at a place like this. What you do get though is delicious and beautifully plated. 

Despite the slightly smaller portions, you don't come to a restaurant like this solely for the food...although that's a big part of it. You come for the entire experience and with that in mind I would definetly recommend Canoe.

4.5/5"}
{"text":"Best best restaurant in Toronto!  Expensive but worth every penny and best food and service ever!  There is nothing like this. Also, best view in the city. I can't say enough good things. Wish I could afford to go more often."}
{"text":"Holy view, Batman!

My partner took me here for my birthday. It has always been on our list of places to go, but let's be honest - this place is expensive, so you need a good reason to go. For most people, it needs to be a special occasion.

Fun fact - my ears popped when I stepped off the elevator.

We were greeted by two hostesses who knew it was my birthday and wished me a happy one. Then we were seated right by the window with a view facing West of the CN Tower and the rest of the city (RBC building is beautiful at night).

Everything was as expected. The service was impeccable and the food even better. I had a Pimm's Cup and my partner had a very nice glass of red wine. For starters we had goats curd and steak tar-tare. Both were delicious and beautifully presented. Then for mains we had the duck breast and Alberta lamb. Both out of this world - especially the veggies. I think they may coat their vegetables in crack.

At the end of the meal we ordered caramel lattes which were also delicious (they can do no wrong apparently.) Then they brought out a small dessert with a candle melted to the plate that said Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce. Very nice touch.

The only negative I can really give Canoe is the bathrooms - they are very office building feeling (yes, it's actually in an office building) but I feel they could have a more luxurious vibe for the amount you are paying.

Wonderful experience and we will definitely be back to try more food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere can make a so-so meal great. In the case of Canoe, the atmosphere made the great food amazing.  Canoe is on the 54th floor in the TD Tower - making for a spectacular view, not to mention a great overall ambiance.

Worth coming to your reservation early and sitting at the bar to take in the setting.

Everything I ate was wonderful, from the artichoke soup to the tea infused duck breast. This is my go-to spot in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great, great, great...I mean, great experience. Yes!-Tha Yelp Daddy gets around!!! This restaurant towers downtown Toronto and the lights of the city brings this elegant restaurant to life. Canoe means romance to couples on a loving date, anniversary or a birthday. Canoe means style to those who are looking to unwind after a day or week of hard work. Canoe means socialize to those business people who are looking to expand their social communities for better networking opportunities throughout the city. For me, Canoe meant \"the grand taste of Toronto.\" Listen, after your ears pop from shooting 54 stories in a fast elevator, you will enter the dimly lit ambiance of a high-toned restaurant.

So, the location, yes...kinda confusing if you are using a GPA, so-MEN- you might have to ask somebody for better directions. The decor-classy. The city view- AMAZING!!!!-so take it all in. The service-outstanding, professional, kind and neighborly. The food-fully of rich flavors and incredible. The drinks-creative with unique twists. And the desserts-extravagant!! The price-It's worth the experience.

**Note:Great place to take your spouse to for a special occasion...Men-great place to propose to your girl-of course, if she is truly worth it. But if you are someone who's still trying to figure out what life is all about then this place might not suit you or agree with your cashflow.

So, check it...I ordered the b a b y  g e m l e t t u c e, which was really tasty. I also ordered the Tea Smoked Duck, which was really flavorful and I got the toffee for dessert-so, very good. This place is excellent-Tha Yelp Daddy approves!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to write many words since I don't think this restaurant deserves them. My wife and I have been here three times: the first was okay, good food, patchy service.  The second time was spectacular and lived up to the reputation. The third time, greasy food, horrible service and delays, absent and confused staff. Not worth the money.  At the price, every one of those three visits should have been pleasant.  Too unreliable, don't believe the hype, take your money somewhere where the biggest feature isn't the view.  You can get a similar view for much less in other buildings by riding the elevator to the top."}
{"text":"The portions are small. limited menu.. Was hoping for more from a Master Chef restaurant. Service was good!"}
{"text":"My fiancé's family took us here to celebrate our engagement. Great location, delicious food, and superb service. We started with the raw platter and the mushrooms. The mushrooms had a lot of flavor and the raw platter was AMAZING! If you love seafood I highly recommend it. I had the haskap sour for my cocktail and it was delicious--I could have drank 5, but stuck with one! For my entree I had the halibut, which was good. I LOVED the little pickles on top of it and the sauce. We had a dessert plate as well and I really enjoyed all of them. The service was great and quick. Our waiter was also knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Went for late-night drinks and snack (Seafood platter):

The Food: hands down the best seafood platter we have had. All the seafood was fresh, variety was good and portion size as well. We especially liked how it was displayed with foam, popcorn and little trinkets that added a fun twist on the order. Oysters, Shrimp and Ceviche were standouts! The wine pairing was also good and we ordered based on suggestions from our server. The dessert we ordered was honestly just a bit gimmicky and passable - we'd recommend just putting the money into adding a few more awesome fresh oysters to your platter! 

Service/ Ambiance: we did not get the terrific view of TD Tower since it was foggy that night but the restaurant was beautifully decorated, intimate and servers only bounce between a few tables - so we were waited on appropriately. Service was textbook: a little bit too formal for our liking (we prefer a bit more conversation/ friendliness) but cant fault them as everything was extremely formal/ professional. 

Our bill was about $200 for a bottle of wine, seafood platter and dessert - a bit on the pricey side but what you'd expect for the namesake of Canoe. Would recommend for an intimate, quiet date night."}
{"text":"Canoe was an extremely pleasant place to dine and the atmosphere was almost perfect.  I wish it were a little more quiet but I can't complain.  The food came out in a timely manner and the lamb chops were perfectly seared and still pink throughout the middle.

The chocolate financier was delectable and how on earth did they figure out that chocolate would be good with fried sesame crackers?  Perfectly orchestrated.

Truly a work of art."}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant in Toronto. Myself and my wife will come here every few months and have never had a bad experience. Heck I took my parents here two years ago and they still tell people about the spectacular experience they had here. The stunning views are matched on every level by the amazing food. Every bite tastes as good as the last. If you do plan on going here then I would suggest making an evening of it. Get dressed up enjoy a great meal and hit the restaurants bar afterwards for a cocktail. It is also worth mentioning that the wait staff is above and beyond anything else in the city. They are very well dressed and super friendly. I was able to have a chat with a host from Scotland that I really enjoyed. Go here and I assure you that you will be dreaming about your experience for the weeks to come."}
{"text":"My Husband took me Canoe as a surprise for my birthday and it was absolutely amazing! We were seated by near the window overlooking the airport and the view was breathtaking. We were able to enjoy the sunset due to the time we chose to have our meal. 

Moving on to the food, we chose to go a-la-carte since there were multiple options we wanted to try. We started out with a few cocktails and apps, one being the Venison tartare and an Albacore dish. All of which was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. We ordered the Lamb shoulder and Steak for main course, the Steak was amazing! So well presented and cooked to perfection. Our server recommended a great wine to go with my steak dinner it hit the spot. The dessert was equally fantastic but since I'm not a dessert person I won't go into it much. Also, I seem to have run out of positive adjectives to describe the food here. It's great! It's all great! The service is fantastic too!

The check matched the food and while I won't be making this a regular go-to i shall definitely bring people over when they visit :)"}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious and it was definitely over hyped. The ambiance and view were amazing (as expected) but the food itself and the portions were not great. As a 5'2 Asian female, I did not find the food filling at all. I definitely expected more from Canoe. Even though it was summerlicious I expected the rest of the patrons to be wearing more formal clothes, but there were many who just showed up in regular t-shirts and shorts. That being said, the servers were very friendly, and the food came promptly. Our server also introduced our dishes and pointed out specific parts of it which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"Visited them for Summerlicious last year and the recollections of the taste still have me salivating. The food was one of the tastiest I have had, the views were impeccable. It is located on 55th floor of TD tower, so the CN tower was right in front from our vantage point as well as gorgeous views of Lake Ontario. It is rightfully in Top 5 restaurants in Canada. The only thing that was a little lacking was the service, our server didn't seem very attentive. It may be because the restaurant was filled to capacity or summerlicious but the food more than made up for it.

I had a foie gras terrine, it was served with caramalized nectarine with complemented it really well; while wife had a salad. For the main course, I had Quebec magret duck breast while wife had a risotto. For desserts we shared a dessert with seasonal berries and a chocolate cake with mint purée. Everything was fantastic. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  The view was fantastic.  The sommelier suggestions for local wine were interesting.  The taste was different, just what I was looking for.  The fish was cooked to perfection and the sides were perfect.  Focused on bringing local cuisine to the table they really hit the mark.  When presenting entrees at the table, multi waiters served everyone at the same time."}
{"text":"This is a review of their Summerlicious menu. I found the overall experience lacking. I've been to Canoe for regular dinner service, and it shouldn't come as a surprise that the service was infinitely more attentive and warm. I'm not saying that subpar service is right at any time, but it's the unfortunate reality I've observed during Summerlicious/Winterlicious at various restaurants in the city. I was just expecting better from a restaurant that's touted as one of the best in the city. There should be some consistency across the board.

I had the Ontario bufala mozzarella, which was perfectly sharp and full of flavour. It was a good start to the meal. The Alberta beef strip loin was less impressive. It was bland and forgettable. The Valrhona chocolate ganache cake was redeeming. I haven't had a bad dessert at Canoe yet.

To be honest, I don't recommend coming here during Summerlicious or Winterlicious. Save it for a special occasion and hopefully they'll step up to the plate."}
{"text":"this place has always been my favourite with consistently amazing service and high quality food. beef short rib was especially good for summerlicious this year, although I found the other dishes I tried (the terrine and panna cotta) didn't stand out to me."}
{"text":"Great view and great food. Went there on my anniversary, the mushroom soup is great. I ordered the steak and cod. The cod was cooked well, very tasty"}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here. To say it was excellent is an understatement. The food was outstanding! The drinks were great! The hostess was able to get us in earlier as we arrived ahead of time. 

We were wished \"Happy Anniversary\" by no less than half a dozen of the staff and they gave us a special desert plate on the house.  

The service was top notch as every need anticipated, we didn't have to ask for anything! It was pricey but it was worth every penny. I highly recommend Canoe for any special occasion or special night on the town!"}
{"text":"While the service is wonderful and the food delicious - this to me isn't the most romantic place for dinner. It's quite loud and doesn't feel all that romantic... not really a place to get cozy. More of a place to take business colleagues. Trust the sommelier! They really know their stuff."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way.  The view is amazing.  

Our server was very attentive and gave us great recommendations for food and drink."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner during their winterlicious event. Warm ambiance and amiable and attentive staffs. The food was great. Tried the smoked salmon on wild rose cream and the venison roast with potatoes and berry sauce, but what I enjoyed the most was the pinna cotta with pistachio cream. Divine! My bill totalled 65$ with tip. Worth it!"}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious 2011 during lunch. It was my first time here and my expectations were definitely not met. 

At the doors, the front desk was very helpful and warm. However, after we settled down, the server was slow. It took a long period of time for us just to receive water. It felt unprofessional. 

It was much louder than I thought it would be. My boyfriend and I both hate noise, so it was not pleasant at all. Although we came at 2 p.m., the loudness lasted until 3:30 p.m. The meal was served slowly, we finished at just a quarter after 4. 

We ordered beluga lentil soup and clover roads duck rillette for appetizers. They were both very tasty, but the portions were small. The duck rillette tasted kind of like tuna though. 

For main course, we had slow cooked heritage salmon and braised alberta lamb pappardelle. The salmon tasted a bit plain, it seemed like any normal cooked salmon. 

For dessert, we had birch syrup pudding and niagara pear panna cotta. Both of us did not like the panna cotta and did not even finish it. I enjoyed the birch syrup pudding, but it was not the best. 

All in all, the atmosphere was a tad too loud and the food was decently tasty. I expected better, next time I'll probably come here for dinner but not for Winterlicious!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have had all year.  First the restaurant is beautiful inside with a very unique decor - think The Great Outdoors meets The Great Gatsby.  Then there's the view...  Our seats faced the CN tower and the lake from the 54th floor.  And the food matches the great, unique setting.  We started with the venison tartare which was the best tartare I have ever had.  To make it even sweeter it was served on an actual Moose Jaw.  Then there was the unreal salmon candy.  I was so impressed with these two dishes that we almost ordered another round of appetizers.  Good thing we didn't because we would have been too full for the rest of this delicious meal.  The entrees we chose were the pheasant medallions and the poached salmon.  Both were exceptional though the most delicious surprise was the fried halibut cheek that showed up on my plate.  Soooo good.  It all paired well with our Rosewood Estates Cab Franc.  We really didn't save room for dessert but we ordered two anyway.  We had a hard time deciding between 3 so our waiter threw the third one in free, another welcome surprise.  We somehow found our way to nearly clearing the plate of all 3 desserts and like everything else we tried - outstanding!  This was an exceptional meal from start to finish and I can't wait to come back."}

5 stars for the service 

we came here for lunch with my girlfriends. we probably looked a bit out of place in jeans and casual clothes.. as everyone was probably there for a business lunch. but the service was great. the sommelier helped us pick a glass of wine and then even suggested wineries for us to go to! great guy. we were seated right between the window and the kitchen which is probably one of the best spots. you can chose between watching the chefs and the beautiful views! here's what we ordered..

{"text":"An amazing experience from beginning to end. A true delight, and a shining example of the way a five star, upscale, formal dining room should run. 

I visited Canoe last night with a party of six. As we were dining with clients, a reservation had been made in advance for 6:30. We were seated right away at a large round table in the south-west corner of the restaurant, with excellent, picturesque views facing both south and west. 

Our experience began with a visit from the sommelier, who was, as his title implies, a knowledgeable expert in wine. We settled on a bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (the one which he described as being more \"mineraly\"), and a California Cabernet Sauvignon. I wish I'd taken down the names of the wines, because I want to make sure I pick up a bottle of each the next time I'm at the LCBO. Both wines were divine. 

Once we settled in with our beverages, the waiter arrived promptly to see how we were doing with our menus and to take our order. He took this opportunity to explain the \"Tastes\" menu, which we didn't partake in, and which I'm still not sure I understand. Nevertheless, I ordered the lamb, with mushroom soup to start. 

Our appetizers arrived shortly afterward, and in grand style. A crew of cleverly dressed all descended upon our table at once to deliver the first round of goods. How lovely that everyone receives their food at exactly the same time. The presentation for the mushroom soup was wonderful and unexpected. First I received a nearly empty bowl with a medley of sautéed mushrooms and a spoonful of some sort of heavy, seasoned crème. Immediately behind the first server was a second, carrying a kettle, and she filled the remainder of the bowl with piping hot soup. Once the temperature settled to something that wouldn't burn my delicate tongue, I tasted a delicious mushroom soup, not like anything I've had before. It was very mushroom-y (as one would expect), and seemed to been in more of a both base vs a cream of mushroom soup. 

So, for round two, the lamb. I had two small medallions of lamb, cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection, served over a medley of vegetables and lentils, and dollops of squash purée. The presentation was lovely, laid out in a straight line on a long rectangular plate. I think between our group, we ordered a good sampling of the menu, and everyone seemed very happy with their dishes. In particular, one who ordered the roast beef. She looked like she was in heaven. 

Next, someone at our table ordered a taster of rum for us to share. At first, I was a little unsure about getting into spirits, thinking this meant trouble, but I was in for a treat. The restaurant had 15 year old El Dorado Special reserve rum from Guatemala. It smelled like vanilla and caramel and tasted smooth, and sweet. (PS. This is a secret item, not on the menu.)

Round four, dessert. By this point in time, I was already full, and quite frankly, I probably didn't need dessert, but, as I told my table mates, YOLO. I ordered the date crumble. It was really nice. I loved the hand-turned Orange iced cream. My neighbor ordered the butter tart which was also on my radar, and he said it was really good. Only one person didn't love dessert, and she had ordered the chocolate and peanut dessert, which was actually my runner up, so I'm glad I went with the date concoction.  

Overall, a great evening was had, with great company and an excellent dining experience. 

Thanks Canoe!"}
{"text":"Being probably the most well known fine dining experience in Toronto, as a visitor, I made a mandatory visit and was left disappointed. The food itself is quite delicious and accents rare Canadian produce and flavours in expectedly small portions. The food is not the problem as the trout I ordered was cooked perfect. The duck breast was very tender and not overly salted, the Alberta lamb saddle also melted in your mouth. Finally, the beef tenderloin was again, cooked great with a lighter sauce making it a great entree. We also shared two appetizers beings first the venison tartar which was my first time trying game meat and I was pleasantly surprised. It was an interesting texture and wasn't too wild tasting if that makes sense. We also tried the baby gem lettuce salad and although very very small, it was refreshing and exotic with the egg. The desserts ordered were the butter pecan tart which I adored for a smaller but maple filled taste and pecans. Their crumble bits were also great. Also tried the date trifle and i didn't really get it but interesting with many little details. 

The main reason for such a poor rating is not the food or even the high prices but the service. Our server was not only absent most of the night. He didn't seem to care about our table at all. When he came to give us dessert menus he just placed it in front of us, not a word spoken. The bills is what irked me the most because instead of asking my dad to pay, he came by with a machine, stuck his hand out and waited, again not a word spoken and did the transaction with no emotion, questions or thanks. In my opinion, food defines a restaurant more than service but for this kind of fine dining experience, he made the entire night kind of a hassle trying to find him to order, get water or anything else. I wouldn't recommend coming at all because yes, it's expensive and in no way does the service live up to their expectations."}
{"text":"I went here for a business dinner - we had the corner table at the windows - a perfect view!

I ordered the Ahi Tuna salad which was incredible. Honestly, everything we ordered was incredible. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone from out of town because of the view!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant for a special occasion.  The views are magnificient, the atmosphere very pleasant and the food is inventive - and a tribute to Canada.  They have a 7-course Tasting menu for $100, but items can be added and subtracted on an ala carte basis - so we found it best to build your own menu.  We started with Pumpkin seed bread with lentil spread which was great. next we had fried foie gras with peanuts and lingonberries.  It was outstanding.  For entreees we had Venison with steel cut oats, which was tasty and tender, and Rhubarb-crusted sablefish - also an excellent choice,  We also had chilled asparagus, which was well- prepared. For dessert, the date toffee bread pudding was outstanding. All-in-all a great meal.  Pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"We were supposed to dine here our first night in Toronto; but do to flight delays, we missed our dinner reservation. Since the restaurant is closed on the weekends and we were just visiting for a long weekend, we opted for lunch on our last day (Monday afternoon). I'm so glad that we ended on a high note!!! Canoe was awesome from start to finish.

Food: 
Lobster clubhouse salad - the waiter suggested that I turn the lobster clubhouse sandwich into a salad. THANK YOU!!! It was amazing!! Fresh and light, but still had elements of a club sandwich. 

Steak tartare - good appetizer, very fresh, went well with the crostini and the house bread. 

Romaine salad - nice and light with fresh ingredients.  

Steak frites - quality of the steak was better than what you would typically expect for steak frites. I believe it was a filet. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned well.

Butter tart - WOW!!!! GLORY!!!! It was indescribable! The desserts were just outstanding. It's been a few days and I'm still thinking about cake, toffee, ice cream, etc. Pure perfection.

Milk chocolate peanut caramel - Yes, I will take two, please!!! The whipped cream, ice cream, caramel, peanuts and cake sent me over the edge!!! 

The wines by the bottle and glass were superb. We had a bottle of Pinot Noir from Oregon and glasses of Sauvignon Blanc from Niagara 

The room and view are worth coming here on their own. The service was great. 

I will definitely come back for dinner and lunch, if I find myself back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Toronto I love taking in the views of Lake Ontario and Cityline from the harbour, from the island and looking down from the 54th floor of the TD tower. With Summerlicious and PanAm games crowds, walk-in bar seating was perfect. 

Bar bites were reasonably priced and bar staff (Jane) was attentive and extremely helpful with recommendations. 

Bread with white bean and beet spread was hardy and a nice change to see something other than oils or fats with bread. Duo of Tartare of beef & salmon was a perfect portion of meats and baby bannocks. If there's foie gras on a menu I have to order it. The S'mores foie gras was a balanced combination of savoury and sweet. This starter is a must have when coming here. To finish something light the apricot  mousse from their Summerlicious menu. Stewed apricots with an airy mousse was smooth ending to my mini-tasting menu. With a glass of wine my bill with tip came close to $100. 

Highly recommend visiting Canoe if not for a full meal come for a drink or cocktail in the bar and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"Solid fine dining experience.  

Do I think the food on it's own is worth the pricing?  No
Did I enjoy the food and overall experience? Yes

This was my second foray to Canoe after a gap of a couple of years.  Definitely a business-like atmosphere and for these prices, this place makes most sense when on the corporate account.  But I do enjoy Canoe for what it is.  

The menu did feel a bit \"safe\" but you should find something you like.  I had the ceviche to start and thought it was ok, I've definitely had better.  The mushroom soup on the other hand was much nicer with a burnt rustic flavour.  The Alberta Lamb had some generous high quality cuts of meat and although the pieces of falafel on the side didn't blend perfectly, I still enjoyed this main course. The Halibut was nicely done but a bit on the salty side.  One thing happened after this meal, I woke up a bit parched which confirmed how much salt was used.  I know all restaurants do this to some extent but if the ingredients are fresh, you don't have to use this much.  The food is delish but not sure if it's Michellin level.

The atmosphere was energetic and nicely laid out in an elegant manner.  The bar was bustling, the view was awesome, and the service was excellent.  All these factors help solidify this restaurant at 4 stars IMO.  

If you have just 2 glasses of wine and a three course meal for two then it will set you back about ~$250.  I don't feel the need to rush back but I can see myself returning for special occasion in the future.  The sophisticated, power broker atmosphere is unmatched in the city."}
{"text":"Did the taste of maritimes for a friends birthday a few days ago and the cod and lobster tail tasted mediocre at best. The atmosphere, view and servers were amazing and that's why this over priced restaurant gets a three star. On food alone, it would have been a two star. 

Go here if u have money to blow and don't care what u eat. I much prefer small dinky looking restaurant with fresh and flavourful food compare to this restaurant.

I'm disappointed because I expected more"}
{"text":"Attended a private dining function In the private dining room.  The servers were top notch offering drinks and alternate non alcoholic drinks.  The view is incredible as always.  The hor d'oeuvres were plentiful and delicious.  My most favourite was this fried ball of mushroom risotto.   Our starter green bean salad was very refreshing and light and all the flavours were nice together.  Our main was a chicken dish with perfectly crispy skin and moist meat and peas and edamame below.  Dessert was fresh local fruit with creme fraiche and meringue bits.  All very nice together.  It was such a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"What a great experience - from beginning to end! The views were remarkable, the cocktails were fantastic. We did the tasting menu with the wine options SPECTACULAR! You know how some places are very strict about not letting you change anything on the tasting menu - well they let us! The service was exceptional! I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Foie Gras; Rockfish; side of wild mushrooms. All pretty good. Only thing that was really noteworthy were the mushrooms. Foie gras itself was good, but only very sweet sides to accompany (s'mores) - would have been a good desert actually. Rockfish was good, but prepared in fairly simple form. Still enjoyable. Wild mushrooms as a side was the highlight. Ambiance is very nice with obviously a great view."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite place in the city, and the deserving winner of Toronto Life's Top Restaurant Review.  

Eating at Canoe is like no other experience you'll ever have.  From the moment you walk in the door and are greeted by the hostess, to the expert mixologists behind the bar, to the service in the dining room, to the absolutely fantastic food prepared by their expert kitchen staff, it is worth every penny that you will spend.  And you can spend a lot of those pennies.

The food is expertly prepared and beautifully presented.  Canoe focuses on Canadian Regional Cuisine, meaning products sourced in Canada, and following, with a twist, some good old fashioned Canadian recipes.   Prepare to indulge in Oysters from the East, Caribou from the Yukon served with a classic Tourtiere, BC Crab, and more.

A fantastic wine list, with something respectable no matter how much you want to spend.  Even their house wines, custom blends done at Cave Springs Winery in Niagara, are a good choice.

While many people who have not enjoyed this restaurant may automatically assume a certain pretentiousness to it, once you step inside you will feel immediately at ease, welcomed by their friendly and highly polished staff."}
{"text":"Attended Dec 2014. Food and wine were superb. Had the Sirloin steak and some seafood appetizers. The steak was spectacular; and I don't say that very lightly. Very nice wine to go with it. Service and ambience are unmatched. If you've been to Canoe, you'll be familiar with the restaurant. Not much has changed. Canoe excels as an experience."}
{"text":"Came in March and had the tasting menu I believe it was (108 per person). This place is definitely quality over quantity. You do get small portions but the taste is phenomenal. The rabbit here was the best I every had, the oysters were interesting I never had them with foam before so it was the first and it was delicious gave it a different texture on the palate. The palate cleanser  was a bit strong for me and I wasn't able to finish. Overall the experience was great! 
The service is always attentive and nice, love the environment and overall feel of this restaurant!
The only downside is that I couldn't get the a window table when booking 2 weeks in advance, book earlier to ensure a spot!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting to go to Canoe for about 100 years and perhaps had over-hyped it in my mind. Yes - the food was wonderful - 5 stars. Yes - the view is incredible and the sevice was outstanding. Where it fell short of greatness is that it really felt like being in an office building with a bunch of suits grabbing a bite after work. Furthermore, if you're going to wash up before dining, you have to go down the hall to the public loo, with its buzzing fluorescents and puddled countertops. It really killed the ambience; great restaurants need to hit on all 5 senses."}
{"text":"Wow.  Wow.  That's all I can say about this place.

My fiancee and I are both foodies from San Francisco, and we have eaten at just about every great restaurant in the SF Bay Area.  Canoe would easily be a top restaurant in SF or NY City, if it were to move to either city.  The food was fabulous, and the service was both warm and attentive.  

And the view, holy cow, REALLY fabulous.  If you can only go to one high-end restaurant on your trip to Toronto (either for $$$ reasons or time constraints), this place should be high on your list."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the city. We were treated perfectly, the food was perfect (had the tasting menu), and I will surely go back the next time I have to opportunity. Our waiter Patrick was hospitable, friendly, and on the mark with wine pairings. Thanks so much Canoe!"}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary for dinner and it was amazing. We had 3 courses and each one was delicious. The flavours were to die for. The view of the Cn tower was phenomenal! The service was great. Our server was very helpful and knew the dishes inside and out. The hostess was friendly."}
{"text":"You'll be paying a lot of dough to eat at Canoe but at least they give you free bread.

We reserved a table requesting a window seat for a birthday. The host knew we were celebrating a birthday, the waiter gave us a free two bite dessert, and the host said happy birthday when we left. Our waiter was very friendly and encourages us to get up and take a view of the city.

The food was simply amazing. I remember biting down on a piece of bok choy and thinking \"how did they make this taste so good?!?!\"

Finally, you're paying for the view which is second only to the CN Tower revolving restaurant. Canoe however offers a view of the CN T so you can't go wrong with either.

Will come back when I make more money or if I win the lottery."}
{"text":"Note - this review is based on Winterlicious 2017 experience ($48 dinner).

Location/Service:
Located in the downtown financial district, right above the TD Tower on Wellington St.  Underground parking is available and is free when you eat at the restaurant - make sure you ask your waiter for a complimentary pass.

Service was alright - probably because it's Winterlicious, I don't feel the service was as top-notched compared to a regular dine-in.  The staff did explain what was being served, so it was a little nice knowing what we are actually eating.


Food:
Appetizer - foie gras parfait.  It was really a parfait style, a bit mushy and soft.  But strong foie gras taste and it compliments well with the pie crust.  I only wished there was more of it, cause the portion was pretty big.  Luckily I used some of the bread as a side spread.

Main - ontario beef tenderloin.  Cooked medium rare - juicy and not dry. The kale added a nice complimentary taste as it was a bit sour.  It would nice if the portion was a little bigger (cause I love to eat beef), but it's winterlicious - so kinda expected.

Dessert - sticky toffee pudding. Sticky indeed and very sweet from the combo of caramel and toffee.  It was still alright - there's a little bit of raspberry to offset the sweetness.


Overall I had a nice time at Canoe.  You really need to book in advance for winterlicious and they are a little strict with being on time.  But you get a really nice view, nice fancy atmosphere - and with party of 8 and a few drinks, it's quite enjoyable :)"}
{"text":"Arguably Toronto's most acclaimed restaurant. Unfortunately, with expectations set high, Canoe disappointed. I felt that most of the dishes played it too safe, putting them below the likes of Splendido, Scaramouche, and the now-defunct Colborne Lane in my books. Nevertheless, my experience was positive overall. Dishes were executed with near perfection and a couple of them are among my all-time favourites."}
{"text":"The best thing about canoe is the view.  Having said this, I have been there a few times for both lunch and dinner. I keep finding it to have great service with mediocre food at an outrages price.  For the price you pay, the quality and taste of the food just does not match.

At my most recent visit, I called a week in advance to make a reservation for a client who was coming into town,  I asked for a table by the windows and was told it would not be a problem.  Well, we did not get one even though we showed up on time, there were tables available and we reminded them again. Our server was fantastic and made the whole evening. But, as much as I hate to say it, the food was \"ok\" at best.

I have asked other friends who have been there and they agree also.  They will go back but you always feel that you have been had a bit when you get the bill given the quality and taste of the food.  Too bad as everything else is great.

There are just so many other places within 1 or 2 blocks that you can go for better food and far less money."}
{"text":"I came here for summerlicious with my boyfriend and were both really satisfied with the food. The steak I had for entree was a big hit for me. It was cooked perfectly to rare and the different sauce on the plate worked really well with the steak. I absolutely savored every bite. The chilled cucumber soup was refreshing as a summer appetizer but I enjoyed my boyfriend's salmon appetizer a lot more. The waiter was not as attentive as other high-end restaurant, but the food and the night view was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Canoe for a while, but since I don't have an expense account, I got my friend (and Amex holder) to call for reservations the first day possible for Winterlicious.

We went for lunch but hadn't come from work, so we weren't as dressed up as most of the rest of the clientele. No one batted an eye. (Granted, it's not like we were wearing jogging pants! We were just not in business wear.) The service, from start to finish, was exceptional. Everyone was warm, and more importantly, genuine -- these people actually like their jobs and clearly take pleasure in making people feel welcome. 

However, I am sure you are wondering...how was the food? The only menu option was the Winterlicious menu, with three options for each course. My dining companion had the salad to start, and I had the lentil soup. She described hers as \"AMAZING.\" My soup was good, but I am definitely not going to go to bed dreaming about it. 

For mains, she had the pork and I had the lamb. The pappardelle pasta was incredible. It was clearly handmade and perfectly cooked. My companion might be dreaming about her pork schnitzel tonight. The combination of flavours was exceptional. 

The desserts were also yummy: for me, the birch syrup cake and for her, the panna cotta. The cake had a fantastic ginger foam, and not ginger ale ginger: real, tangy, zesty ginger. Mmmmm.

As I said above, the service was just exceptional. I am not sure if they are just doing this for Winterlicious, but they gave each of us a package of spice rub (the one they used on their salmon main) to take home. And then they helped us on with our coats!"}
{"text":"Delicious, super friendly and attentive staff... professional waiters are the best... beautiful view.

Can it get any better?"}
{"text":"The food was slightly below mediocre. The service appeared to slow down on purpose for our table, because we were on Winterlicious, and the work lunch took 2.5 hours. The view is nice, but it would be quite a compliment to call this a good restaurant."}
{"text":"This is probably the most pretentious, rude restaurant I've ever visited.  After extremely rude treatment and then waiting for someone to take our order for ten minutes we ended up walking out without ordering anything.  If you're looking for a special dinner spot go to The George, it was amazing."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Took my husband there for a birthday dinner on a Thursday night. I made reservations on Monday so couldn't get a table before 9:30pm but we went there at 9pm and sat at the bar which has great views too. 
The table was ready by 9:20 and they gave us a cozy one with a great view. The food was excellent - especially the pork belly and the beef main courses. Dessert was the most decadent flourless chocolate cake with a very sweet birthday message piped on to the plate.
The service was impeccable and the wine selection pretty impressive. We were there till midnight and never felt rushed. My husband loved the surprise and I got a lot of credit for not much effort. Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"My partner took me here to celebrate New Year's Eve. This is my very first experience eating at Canoe and  I can say it's absolutely beautiful. Located at a level that allows you to see Centre Island, CN Tower, etc if you get to sit next to the window - lucky you. I didn't, but it was still a beautiful view from inside. Canoe also had an ice sculpture to welcome to new year outside their restaurant - very neat! 

For food, Canoe offers a set menu on New Years Eve. My partner ordered the wine pairing along with the menu.. For appetizer, I ordered a smoked salmon  while he ordered the french onion soup. The salmon came in a high dome glass - imagine beauty and the beast rose encasement. It was beautiful. The dome helped smoked the salmon and the servers only open it when its at your table. Salmon itself was quite good - but I was so much more amazed at the presentation. My partners French Onion Soup wasn't quite my thing. It was a bit sweeter than I imagine usual French Onion Soups to be. But he seemed to like it a lot. 

For entree, I ordered the elk, while my partner ordered the striploin steak. I have never tried elk before, so it was a new experience. I would say I liked my partners steak more. The elk dish didn't have as much flavor and juiciness. 

For dessert, we ordered lemon curd meringue  It was an interesting dish - I wouldn't say I would order it again despite my love for dessert

Service at Canoe was excellent - extremely attentive to your needs, so polite, quick, and really know their dishes well. I do admit that the price here is very very high. But for those special occasions, I guess it's good to experience something nice once in awhile."}
{"text":"Came into town for a short amount of time and had one lunch to splurge with my husband. Canoe delivered. The view (top of the TD building), the wine and the service were excellent...but the food stole the show. 

We started with tamarack farms tomatoes and the romaine salad and then enjoyed the halibut t-bone and the roast chicken -- both amazing. Cooked well, lots of flavor and not too heavy. 

Added bonus? Enjoyed some local wine along with our food."}
{"text":"I was just here for a private event over the weekend and the food was phenomenal! I was informed that most unfortunately, the menu we had was not available on their regular menu so I won't disclose what it was because it'll just make both me and you sad that we won't be able to have it again. 

I knew it was on the 54th floor but even so, the view was absolutely breathtaking when I actually stepped in. The sunset was nothing short of spectacular either. 

The service was exceptional, most notably managers Lee and Billy, who both ensured everything went as planned as well as accommodated some unforeseen circumstances and last minute requests. Thanks for everything!!!"}
{"text":"Winterlicious Lunch Review

The Booking process needs to be improved. I tried to call a number of times as soon as the Reservation window opened. I was not able to get through for a few days. It was a hassle. If the Reservation staff can not keep up with the surged demand during the Winterlicious period, perhaps they should consider allowing reservations via Opentable (as they do for the remainder of the year). I'm sure the choice to have people call in was made for business reasons, but as I said it was quite annoying. 

Nevertheless, apart from the Reservation process, it was a great experience. We were lucky enough to get a table by the window with a great view. 

-My smoked salmon started was okay. My wife got the sheeps curd, which was really good. Quite a gamey taste (like goat's cheese). 
-We each ordered the brisket for the main course. It tasted fine... could have been cooked a little more to make it softer I'd say. This was probably my least favorite course... it wasn't very inventive (in composition or presentation)
-We shared our deserts (panacotta and caramel/ chocolate pastry dish).., both were tasty

I'll probably return for the normal period for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Every food connoisseur's dream! As a Birthday present, my friend took me to Canoe and it was everything we expected.

Upon arrival, a host checked our coats before we were seated. The table gave us a great view of the CN Tower. Since it was after 8:00pm, we were really impressed with the city lights. 

For a Tuesday evening, Canoe was quite busy with 2 large tables of businessmen and several couples celebrating a romantic occasion. 

Service is above standard (you would expect it to be at those prices). An explanation of the menu was given, but we already knew that we wanted the Tasting Menu, which included:

- Amuse Bouche (the prosciutto melted in my mouth)
- Scallop Ceviche (refreshing and zesty)
- Artichoke Soup (perfect cream texture)
- Intermezzo (to cleanse the pallet)
- Main course - I selected the Char (crispy and savoury seared top was amazing)
- and a Dessert, Caramel Poached Niagara Pears (a bit sweet for my liking but satisfying).

A wine from Ontario or Quebec was paired with each of the courses.

Presentation of each course was beautiful, dainty and flowed kind of like scrolled penmanship! 

Even more impressive then the view was the timing of each course. Completed to perfection. Each time I set down my empty wine glass, a server was there to take it away, give us a slight pause/breather, and bring us the next glass before the next dish.

I am a big fan of small plates and trying different items, which is probably why I loved the tasting menu. Not sure how often they change it but if my wallet allowed, I would return for the next version.

We left Canoe feeling satisfied and in a blissful state!"}
{"text":"One of the best Toronto has to offer, continuing to stand the test of time. We did the tasting menu on US Thanksgiving and it was themed as such. The highlight was the pheasant done \"turducken style\". 

Gorgeous view, nice service and amazing food and plating, matched well with tasty wine. Not much else to say. Only complaint was maybe jazzing up the decor a bit. It's starting to look a little dated."}
{"text":"I am impressed by the starters, northern woods mushroom soup. The reason is the serving style is quite different, with the cook serves the soup with the kettle. Of course, the soup itself taste really good~"}
{"text":"Service is great. The salmon starter ( I forget the whole name of the course...)? is awesome."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, when we arrived, the greeters were very friendly and professional with the welcoming and bringing us to our table.  Unfortunately, even though we forgot to mention that we wanted a window city-view table while we were making reservations a week ago, we were still happy with the table we got.

The staffs were all very nice and attentive; every time my friends went to the washroom, they would come over and fold my friend's napkin and place it back neatly on the table.  They made sure our glasses and wine glasses were never empty!

Canoe offered us a loaf of bread and hummus to make sure that we're not waiting for our appetizers on an empty stomach.

All three courses (appetizer, main course, & dessert) had the right amount of flavor, resulting in a very delightful experience.  The portion may seem small, but don't let that fool you.. it's the arrangement and the way they put the food on the plate that makes it look less; at the end, all my friends were either satisfied or full.

On a side note, I really liked how they give you a brief description of the food/ingredients your plate consists of whenever they put it down in front of you!"}
{"text":"Canoe was everything I expected it would be, and more. 
This famous Oliver and Bonacini restaurant was all it's hyped up to be for me. 
I expected that it would be too busy to get in without reservations, but at around 5:00 pm, there was no wait, and we were able to get in without a problem.

I had a remarkable view of Toronto, and was able to enjoy it along with the sunset. 
The restaurant is well designed, in that even if you are not sitting next to window, you can still get a good view of the city. 

The table comes with a bread basket and a delicious spread, unlike something I have ever had. I ordered a main that is not on the current menu, a fish dish. I find most restaurants do not do fish well, but it was exquisite - succulent, perfectly seasoned. 
I can't recall what I had for dessert, but I remember I enjoyed it very much. The chef also brought out a free appetizer for the table, which was also delicious. 

The service doesn't lose any points either. Our server was attentive, efficient, informative, and always available.

I loved the atmosphere, the way the patrons actually took time with their presentation, the service, the food, and the overall experience."}
{"text":"The food and view are the obvious draws and the service is also excellent...just be sure to get a table near the window as I was disappointed to learn that we didn't have much of a view when we were sat. They also didn't move us when other tables opened up until the end but the food switched my mood as it was delicious. I went for winterlicious and had the parfait, beef short rib and sponge cake. Everything was beautifully prepared."}
{"text":"Did the tasting menu, one of the best tasting menu's I've had. I love they strive to use Canadian ingredients and the service is impeccable. Will be back. Also, one of the best views of the sunset in the city."}
{"text":"I went to Canoe since they participated in Winterlicious. I enjoyed this place very much. It is a classy place and has friendly people. I came a bit early so they sat me at the bar which was really nice. They seemed so busy that the bartender didn't even take my drink order and about 20 minutes later I was seated. The view of Toronto is gorgeous. I got the butternut squash bisque, beef tenderloin and for dessert chocolate pudding and everything was delicious. I finally ordered my Long Island Beverage and it was made to perfection. I would've given them a five stars but the bartenders are what made me take that back. Otherwise everyone is nice and friendly and I had a great experience."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Canoe and we decided to do the $45 Summerlicious dinner menu.  I'm usually not a big fan of summerlicious menus  as I've had poor experiences with service and quality in the past.  My dinner at Canoe definitely swayed me in the opposite direction!

We reserved the 5pm seating on a Saturday in an effort to avoid the potential chaos if we came later.  We were seated by the window with a spectacular view of the Toronto waterfront and center island.  Our waiter was extremely professional and friendly and cracked some jokes about the ensuing frenzy over the next 2 weeks.  I had the cucumber soup, wellington beef, and bread pudding.  Each dish was delicious, particularly the wellington beef, which was tender and juicy.  My partner had the tuna as her main and we both preferred the beef more.  We also added the $15 wine pairing chosen by their sommelier, which I would suggest for anyone as the waiter gave us generous portions of wine and they paired very well with my meal.

The restaurant operated like clockwork.  You could tell that they had prepared themselves well for the summerlicious rush.  Food came out quickly, but we were not pressured at all to finish our meals.  When the couple across us left, their table was cleaned and re-set within several minutes.  I spoke to our waiter a bit and was told they had hired extra staff including food runners and table-setters to keep their service levels up.  If you can get a reservation, for $60 with the wine pairing per person this is a must!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and the view was spectacular I can't imagine how it would look like In all bling at night:) the food was superb . I had the ricotta honey salad  as a starter and the steak which my very knowledgable waiter recommended I get medium rare . Both were fantastic . Service \"impeccable\" . I would go again for sure:)"}
{"text":"Definitely a great experience the last visit I had, but it was to be expected at one of the highest classed restaurants in Toronto. 

Came by here for my best friend's birthday, and we decided to have a good time and not hold back! Go big or go home right? We went for drinks, great food, and excellent wine!

The view was absolutely amazing, as it changed as the night progressed. From a wonderful sunset, to a bit of clouds and fog. It made for an interesting night view. 

First off, the summer cocktails were quite unique. From things with marshmallows to dandelions, definitely a unique twist to drinks. The wine was quite good, as we got a couple bottles of the 2027 from an Ontarian winery. With only a 149 crates ever made, Canoe has most of the crates. 

The food was amazing, which was to be expected. We started with the Raw Bar which included everything from octopus, and squid, to fish and oysters! Everything was very fresh and done beautifully. 
With the appetizers, our table had different things, but the highlight were definitely the Mushroom Soup. Very rich mushroom flavour, but balanced well with ingredients. 
For main courses, they were all very good, but the Trout and Lamb were definitely the top two!

The service was definitely great when we were there. They were extremely attentive without bothering, knowledgeable and resourceful, and helped out in any way they could. 
There was a mix up with our reservation at first with he host staff, but it was resolved on their end with apologies, so you can't be too upset about that. 

A great experience, but definitely on the pricier side. I would highly recommend it for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Canoe for a pre-dinner cocktail (or 2) and were lucky enough to nab a window seat. What a view!! It was fantastic being able to view the city and the islands from our bird's eye view, with delicious cocktails in hand.

Our server was incredibly personable and even wrote down a nice list of things for us to do while we were in Toronto. We probably could've stayed there the rest of the evening and been happy, but I'm a vegan leaning vegetarian and the menu was pretty meaty. So, since a girl's gotta eat, we settled up, but are left with really nice memories of our time at Canoe."}
{"text":"Went for a summerlicious lunch. I messed up the date of the reservation but they sat us anyway. I got to see all of the lunch menu dishes come out after I ordered. The best combination seems to be the white fish, the steak and the millefeuille."}
{"text":"Not worth the expensive price tags. I'd recommend Richmond Station over Canoe.

I came here on a lunch break after hearing all the hype about this place.

Ambiance:
+ Sweeping views of downtown Toronto including the CN tower if you sit at the high table by the bar or by a window table

Service: 
+Friendly and prompt service

Food:
+O&B bread served upon request- butter and bread was tasty and filling
+ b.c. pink shrimp + heirloom tomatoes- the tomatoes were the star of this dish but it was consumed in less than 2 bites (for $17, the stomach wanted more)

-Hungry Hungry Pongy"}
{"text":"I went in with a friend for evening drinks following a show. The servers were very friendly and we sat at communal table which was fine. Once we got our drinks we were kind of ignored and sat for a long time without being offered more beverages or the bill, which was the only negative."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Canoe. It's the darling of the Financial District; a \"must-go-to-if-you-haven't\" and as such a common choice for business meetings, team dinners, etc. for those on Bay Street and in the vicinity.

The first time I went to Canoe it was for Summerlicious (dinner). I would not recommend this having recently gone for a (regular) lunch and had a far superior experience. Perhaps it was my choices (duck terrine appetizer, steak as a main, and I believe cheesecake-esque dessert) but nothing apart from the dessert was particularly memorable. The terrine was a bit dry and the steak somewhat rubbery and more fatty than I'd expect. Dessert was great - light, picturesque, sweet but not overly so.

Lunch a few weeks ago was an entirely different story - I ordered a pasta special (it was tagliatelle with a lamb ragu). Superb - absolutely wonderful. Such rich flavours, and a goat cheese layer on top that paired beautifully with the meat and pasta. It was all so warm and melted together like strings of notes in perfect harmony. Dessert was, again, fantastic - I got the hazelnut torte which came with a few component pieces (a stick of torte which was chocolatey and nutty and altogether quite nice, a meringue of sorts that I can't say I loved but still found very creative and inventive). It was great and I'd recommend it easily.

Overall - I found this can be a bit of a hit or miss, but when it's a hit, it's really something memorable. Also - great view!"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious and while the food didn't blow me away the way I'd expect from such a revered restaurant, it was still a good experience. We were seated along the bench along the windows and had a clear view outside. It does feel a little weird to eat in an area that feels like it's meant for the bar, but the view was good and it was private enough. 

We ordered the strip loin and Alberta lamb, both of which were good. If I were picky and compared presentation to taste, I think presentation wins easily. However, all of the dishes were good at worst. My desert was easily my favourite.

The atmosphere was subdued and private. I liked the lowkey energy and maybe this is because I wasn't in the main dining area, but there wasn't the snooty vibe I'd expect from a place like this. 

I would probably come back for Summerlicious or Winterlicious. Based on what I experienced, it's a dependable restaurant. I have no doubt that their regular menu's prices feature more of the \"this is a famous restaurant\" and \"look at the view!\" premiums, so I'm not sure I'd come on a regular day. But for a special occasion, I can see why this place is a hit."}
{"text":"Hi and, good day to the staff, and, might I add that they were all nice, and, very kind but also the restaurant (TD Centre) is spacious, and, beautiful.  I enjoyed a brief talk with the front desk personnel. I also applied to their new restaurant Partegghio.  Have a nice day and, thanks for the nice reception at the entrance.  J.P."}
{"text":"Elegant resto, attention to detail is impeccable. Serving staff is top notch, attentive and classy. The food was amazing. Was there with a group of professional IT people and we were treated with white glove service. The menu was fix, so I did not get a change to explore a lot, however what I was served was \"Cordon Bleu\" grade. It's shameful that The Michelin critics do not travel to Canada, because this would be a two star if not three star Michelin rating. I will be back with my love, and we will explore all avenues of their menu...

Started with the Romaine Salad, served with Red Fife croutons, Thunder Oak Gouda, and house Creamy Garlic Dressing. 

For the main, I selected the Clodhammer Steak, with Charred Asparagus, in a Smoked Soubise Puree, accompanied with Chimichurri Potato Salad.

The Wine was delish, did not get a chance to grab the name. 

For dolce, I selected the Lemon Tart!

Tout était parfait!"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times for lunch and dinner during Summer/Winterlicious. Food is great, but I think I would only go there during Winter/Summerlicious period. The location is good, but view is not as good as expected as the window is not very clean."}
{"text":"Best meal in Toronto so far. Everything was perfect, some stuff was really unbelievable. Expensive, but it's worth for that special occasion."}
{"text":"Say it's your anniversary. Be surprised with a lovely table facing Toronto Downtown skyline. On the 54th floor.

First of all, their cocktails are great. Experimental, in the intuitive Bon Appetit magazine kind of way, not weird. Think combinations like: sage & pear & vanilla or berries and mint.

The tasting menu was good - lots of layers of flavor, and very well thought out. Five dishes, a palate cleanser and cute apple bites for the end. 

The mushroom course stands out most in my mind. Literally, the server came over and told me to take a moment to observe & appreciate what was on my plate. I'm glad he did it, I'm sure it took more than a hot minute to assemble it.
There were 4-5 different kinds of mushrooms, cooked in different ways. A thick creamy foam was poured on top. I don't even remember if there was a pasta or some kind of protein with these mushrooms. The only potentially odd thing was that I felt very much like I was eating a mossy, mushroom-y forest. Some people like that, some people don't. My boyfriend, for example, did not.  But I think the intentionality behind their dishes is what really counts. Plus, The fried maple leaf was awesome!

In general, a great place for seasonal fare, and if you don't forget the anniversary lie/tip, it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here on a recent visit. Had 3 courses and each course had a very nice and unique blend of flavours. The tuna and salmon were wonderful. The panacotta had some asian infusion flavouring. The view is nice and the setting is fairly decent though not as big as I would normally have thought it to be. Great wine list and half bottles if you aren't feeling too adventurous.....def will go back.....maybe during the day next time!"}
{"text":"This was my third Visit to canoe in the past 6 months and I was never disappointed
There was a reason why this restaurant was always on the Toronto top restaurant list. Personally, I think Canoe has a better food than Auberge du Pommier.

For the appetizer, I think soup was the best choice to go with. It was tasteful and warm, which was perfect for the winter. Rest of appetizers were also prepared nicely, but portion was small .
For main
 I like the pork better than Lamb. 
Lamb was cook perfectly. The meat was soft and melting in the mouth. However, the meat itself was lack of texture. 3/5 
Roasted pork was full of flavor, moisturized and tasteful. I was very impressed. However, the portion is relatively small compared to lamb. 5/5

Dessert
Pumpkin cake has cinnamon spice in it. So if you don't like cinnamon, do not order pumpkin cake. 
The rest of two desserts are both perfect finish of the day.

In addition, I highly recommend leaning post rose/red/white wine. It was really smooth wine. You are not able to buy this wine from LCBO. They are only sold winery or restaurants. 

Last but not least, it has a perfect view by the window and great service!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Amazing view. The place is a little hard to find because it is in the bank tower building. The view from the 54th floor though is amazing. There really isn't a bad spot in the restaurant. I would advise looking at the menu online before you go if you have picky eaters in your party. Lots of really interesting and different dishes but really amazing food! I had the halibut which was like butter and I highly recommend and the mushroom soup which was so good! They have a lot of great specialty drinks too. The desserts are amazing too! I tried 4 of them. It is very pricey but definitely a must if you can afford to."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves a michelin star. Honestly so much standards here."}
{"text":"One hell of a view.  And one hell of a stab at your wallet.  Great place to check out once in your life.  The dessert, drinks and service were awesome.  But then again, the view was so overwhelming, anything else was gravy."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and dinner and i have to say...i preferred lunch...the views were amazing and the prices very reasonable, especially for a biz lunch

I had the rack of lamb, and that was probably one of the best i've ever had. The lamb was done medium rare and very tender and flavorful. Portion size was just perfect as well. 

I also had the date pudding with passionfruit sorbet and it was delish! 

Great service; server heard me telling my lunch companion (visitor from SF) that the Niagara region was known for ice wine...and he poured 2 tasting glasses for us to sample- So nice! 

Great view of the city...it was a perfect lunch"}
{"text":"Plates are small but full of flavor, I really enjoyed my meal and the ambiance. My apple daiquiri was just perfect. Would highly recommend, the views are fantastic!"}
{"text":"We were here for a wedding reception and it was just perfect. They circulated ahi tartare, sliders, and spring rolls during cocktail hour. The tartare was fantastic; spring rolls were predictable. 

It's a very nice space for a private party. Good acoustics and flow from the bar to the dining room. The salads, main dish, and dessert orders were taken by a server and delivered promptly and at the right temperature, which is basically a wedding miracle. The chocolate fondant is impossible to \"try\". 

Great view and reasonable-sized dance floor. We were thoroughly impressed all around."}
{"text":"Stunning views of the city and staff are friendly and knowledgeable. We were there for the New Years dinner and had the three course tasting menu. Our bill for two of us was $500 which I thought was a little steep considering the wine we had was only $70. I think if this place was going to be a business lunch where your company could expense it, then it would be perfect. If you're going on a date, there are cheaper options for the same quality."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Canadian themed dining experience I have ever had.
The restaurant ticks all the boxes of high end dining experience - plenty of well trained, knowledgeable, friendly staff, sleek modern décor, impressive wine list, and of course, fantastic food.
If the intent is to create a Canadian epicurean delight, then they have succeeded in spades. The menu, while small, has breadth of choices that cover just about all conceivable bases - meatitarian, vegetarian, gluten free, vegan, whatever. The quality of the food is first rate, and even more impressive, they do it with almost exclusively Canadian ingredients. Local meats, vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, cheeses and so on comprise the menu in imaginative and delicious combinations. I managed to taste just about everything that our party of five ordered, and nothing disappointed.
Seared foie gras, beef tartare, fresh oysters, forest mushroom soup, steak tartare, fluke ceviche - all made with the finest ingredients and so delicious I considered ordering more before the mains arrived. But then the tea-smoked duck breast arrived, and so did the grain fed Alberta lamb, the filet mignon, and the St. Canut pork, with home made creamed corn, and I happily relented. Wow! The food was good!
And if you manage to save room for dessert, well, you can't go wrong with the chocolate hazelnut torte, the chocolate peanut dessert, or the roasted peaches. Yum!
And the strong Canadian presence in the wine list is filled with gems like the 2002 Speck Cab, Benjamin Bridge's Nova 7 or the 2009 Norm Hardie PEC Pinot Noir.
Kudos to the management team for creating such an outstanding Canadian dining experience, and to the staff for their flawless execution."}
{"text":"Incredible view.  Excellent food, portions well done.  Had tasting menu which was lots of fun and had the opportunity to taste a number of Canadian dishes.  Did find the place a little pricey."}
{"text":"Amazing view! Very classy and stylish. I enjoyed the food. Mushroom soup was my appetizer and it was yummy. My entree was duck meat, which was very good. Great service as well."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday evening for drinks before heading out for dinner. 
Yes, 38 $C for two glasses of wine is more then average, but the ambience is priceless. No need to say that their reds are good ones. 
The waiters were more than helpful in getting us a seat with views over the skyline as well as with dinner recommendations."}
{"text":"Came for lunch during Winterlicious 2017.

When it comes to Canoe, unless you're here for business or it's just another regular place by your standards, you'll probably be going tourist-mode, pressed up against the windows looking down on the world below you and into the horizon. Of course, with a camera.

Or perhaps that is just something I do, given that the other diners were well-dressed and I'm pretty much out-of-place. But it is winterlicious, you're likely to attract uncultured commoners such as myself that typically prefer to grab a lunch special from chinatown.

Everything is well-maintained. Kitchen looks really clean. Washrooms are top-notch, though they don't have any hand-dryers. Instead they opted for paper towels..

We were seated at the west corner facing the CN tower, so there were a lot of viewing options, whether it's out into the lake on the south side, or west towards Mississauga. Because it was daytime, and snowstorm was forecasted throughout the day, we had the opportunity to observe how the distant cities looked when there's a huge snowstorm falling down on them. It was quite a sight, and something you wouldn't be able to see at night.

Each dish comes with a wine pairing, if you would like to go that route.

All of the dishes I ordered were great. From the foie gras, to the chuck flat, to the chocolate fondant. The beef was so tender that you could literally pick pieces apart with chopsticks.

Service was good. Waiter walked over often to check up on things like water and feedback on dishes. Allowed me to challenge the dessert with chopsticks by limiting my choice of utensils. I don't know if this would be considered unacceptable, but for me it was all good.

I don't know whether winterlicious reflects regular service, or how amazing the food really is for those with more experienced palates (given that I see a lot of less than stellar reviews on the food), but for me it's pretty much up there."}
{"text":"I really wasn't expecting to like it here.  I was expecting it to be cold, pretentious and over priced.  Instead I found it was extremely warm and inviting. Yes, it's pricy, but for a special occasion and the spectacular view, it was worth it.  We did the tasting menu with wine pairings and I loved the variety and the luxury of not having to think about anything.  The dishes and the wines were presented with thorough explanations, but for some reason, I didn't find it annoying as I did at Lee.  It felt more like a conversation and less like a presentation, I guess.  On a few wine choices, I felt like maybe they were skimping a bit, but it was nice to try a variety of wines without having to commit to a bottle.  

In the tasting menu, most dishes included a wild variety of flavours.  But then when you reached the mains, it went all zen and settled for a kind of purity.  I tried both the fish and the lamb mains.  The lamb was wonderfully simple, but cooked with a perfection that really brought out the flavours.  I've never had lamb shank so wonderfully seared.  Another thing I liked about the tasting menu was the way they anticipated what should be next.  After a sweet dessert came a refreshing bit of sharp lemon custard and a crusty meringue, etc.  

I will return to this place when I have out-of-town guests that I want to show a really good time to.  The location and the expense will keep me from returning otherwise, but I'm very glad to have tried it, and really enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"I've always heard about Canoe and how great it is but it was below my expectation. Unfortunately we missed the view because it was foggy day with snow. Their timing was perfect and they set the table sharp on time. 
We went there for winterlicioues event. Kale salad was OK but poached salmon was not good at all. I only could eat it with drink. For the main food rib was good but chicken was very very normal. You can find the chicken in other restaurant as well. I believe the best part was desert. We tried both trifle and the cake and both were super delicious. 
While we still eating the desert before we asked for the bill, the waiter brought the bill. It seems that they wanted to kick us out. Anyhow, i think Canoe is overrated."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner tonight and the service was great too, the food is amazing and the view is fantastic I really loved this place !!"}
{"text":"It's great food amazing atmosphere and the braised beef tip is scrumpschous the service was great and an amazing view at the top of the TD tower"}
{"text":"Got seated 10 minutes before our reservation time - yay! But our night didn't escalate that much after that...
I asked for window seating in my reservation and was given a seat in the centre. We still had a view of Toronto but I wish they adhered to our seating preference, or at least notify us beforehand that there was none available for that moment. 

We were greeted by our waiter and he placed our napkins on our laps; I felt like a princess. 

The menu for the night:
- White wine - Pinot grigio
- Daily bread and chick pea spread 
- Coastal half dozen oysters
- Rabbit saddle 
- Risoni risotto 
- Screeched tarte au sucre 

I appreciated how our server poured both my guest and myself some wine to taste. At other restaurants, typically only one guest would taste. 

As for food, I had everything besides the rabbit saddle. The bread was warm to touch with a firm crust. The spread reminded me of hummus - why don't they just call it hummus? It was nice how another server continued to bring us more bread while we were waiting for our mains, which did take a while to reach our table. 

Oysters were oysters - they tasted fresh.

Risoni risotto - I enjoyed this a lot. It was different from other risotto dishes I've had as the rice was more flat and long. The risotto itself seemed to be loose. To explain, the rice would not stick together. However, I preferred this because it didn't make me feel like I was eating baby food. The kale crisps were divine - they were crunchy, thin, and added just enough texture compared to the star of the dish, the risotto. 

Screeched tarte au sucre - This reminded me of a creme brulee, but less sweet and less torched. Would have liked a bit more crunch on the top though! The crust tasted slightly undercooked but overall, good flavours in the dessert.

One thing that would've made my experience better is having the menus labelled for persons with dietary restrictions. I had to ask the server whether 'kohlrabi' was a meat. 

EDIT:
Another thing I forgot to mention was how I almost slipped 3 times while walking on the hardwood floor! Although I was wearing heels, I was able to walk in the lobby and to my car comfortably for 30 minutes. Unsure if my shoes or the flooring...but I vote for the latter."}
{"text":"I've only been to Canoe for Winterlicious lunch, twice. The first time made me want to come back for the second. So when I was in town for Winterlicious, I made a point to come here for another lunch!

I was super lucky to have found a reservation for lunch last minute on OpenTable, as they had been booked up, but with last-minute cancellations, reservations do open up. I did wish that we had gotten a table with a view (I put these in the OpenTable notes), but I believe those are more on a first come first serve basis.

The lunch menu this year was great, with lots of delicious options. To start, we had the foie gras parfait and the poached salmon. Both were very delicious and well-balanced. For mains, we had the albacore tuna and beef short rib. These were also pretty good - not the hugest portion, but decent considering it's Winterlicious. Finally, the desserts we tried were the molasses trifle and the berry parfait. These were also quite good, but not too memorable. Plating was very nice for every dish we had.

Service was all right. I wouldn't say it is outstanding, but it's certainly not bad. I don't expect too much for Winterlicious, though, I must say.

Overall, during Winterlicious, it really is a deal to come here for lunch, even with the price increase. They even validate for parking on the weekend. And you can't beat that view. If I ever find myself in Toronto during liciousTO, I'd definitely have Canoe on my list!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here in July for Summerlicious. This restaurant is exquisite. Definitely my favorite in the city. The food is masterfully prepared and will haunt you for years to come. The panoramic view of the city is spectacular. This is a great first-date place. This is a great place to have dinner and drinks with family and friends. This is a great place to take a client out to dinner. Canoe never disappoints. The service is excellent as well. Well done. Superb."}
{"text":"3.5/5 

Disclaimer: Solely based off the Summerlicious dinner menu. 

This is my first summerlicious experience so was surprised when I managed to land a reservation (for two). Came around 6 pm and was seated without any issues. Its too bad we didn't get a window seat because the view is truly phenomenal. 

As for the food, it was decent but I expected to be blown away given the prestige of Canoe. The fois gras (app) was my favourite of the set, with the caramel and ginger crumble giving a nice light touch. The strip loin (main) was cooked perfectly (med rare) but lacked flavor. The cheek was a tad dry but at least the side vegetables tasted alright if that's anything. The mint chocolate torte (dessert) looked way too sweet for my liking, but it actually tasted alright. Wish the portions were a bit bigger overall. 

Definitely picture worthy, wish it was more food worthy. Was nice to experience during Summerlicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"To celebrate my final night in Toronto, I decided to go with Canoe.  Despite inclement weather, we braved the stormy rains and headed over to the restaurant perched high in a financial building with an expansive view of the city.
Check in was a breeze and since we requested a view, the hostess kindly asked us to relax at the bar while she checked for available seating.  Our wait was brief enough for us to enjoy a few drinks before we were seated, which suited me just fine.

We started with a carrot, garlic & orange olive oil spread - the color was vibrant and the flavors were tangy and robust! It coupled perfectly with the warm pumpkin seed bread and the pairing was  seasonally appropriate.

Raw Bar:
Malay Oyster and Covel bay from New Brunswick
Tuna tartare 
Scallop ceviche
Shrimp with pear & red pepper couly
Kim Chi torched Salmon 
Jumbo shrimp salad 

The oysters were a big hit as expected as well as the tuna tartare and scallop ceviche. The Kim chi torched salmon, however, wasn't especially appealing to me. The flavor profiles just seemed a bit off and the salmon didn't taste fresh to me.

Rib Eye was divine! It was prepared beautifully with a nice crust to it and a warm pink and juicy center.  Coupled with the roasted mustard aioli, each bite made my mouth instantly water. The supporting cast of portobello pickles, crispy layered potatoes, and roasted carrots all added to the earthy flavor profiles of this impeccable dish.

Lamb was presented three ways: as a sirloin, rack and braised meatball.
The sirloin flesh was incredibly soft and cooked to an irresistible medium rare. The rack was lined with a fatty border which added a deep permeating flavor to the lamb. The surprise was a small meatball that was made with braised meat that was very tender and intensely flavorful. The accompaniments of Branson pickles, butterball potatoes, spring onions and baby turnips were nice but were not as successful in rounding out the flavors like the ribeye dish.

We ended the evening with some coffee, a warm butter tart with chocolate covered pecans, coffee soaked raisins, and a smoked vanilla ice cream.  The tart was sublime with a rich and buttery texture that felt like velvet.  I wasn't particularly a fan of the smoked vanilla ice cream as it left a fairly pungent after taste on my tongue.  But overall, it was a satisfying dessert that I would order again sans the vanilla ice cream ;)

Following the meal, we shared some friendly conversation with the server and had our checked coats retrieved.  The experience was pleasant with great service that wasn't overbearing or pushy with up sells and the food overall was mostly up to par with my expectations.

Would I come back again? Absolutely! 

Til next time Toronto...

Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto from Slave Lake, this dining experience was excellent.  Every element of every dish was perfectly crafted and meshed seamlessly together."}
{"text":"Feels like this place cruises on reputation alone. The tasting menu was thoroughly disappointing save for 2 items and the service was snooty, slow and uninterested(ing) much like their food.

The Good:

Rabbit Agnolotti was insanely pungent and aromatic with an incredible depth of flavour. The creamy sauce was so thick you could use to fuse popsicle sticks together and make a birdhouse. 

The Wild Boar entree had an asian-y seared pork feel to it with crispy skin protecting it's wonderfully soft, fatty bits. Real shame I didn't order this and got the Skate Wing instead.

The Boring:

Octopus Torchon starter was beautifully presented but lacked any sort of real flavour. It felt like eating a plate of texture. At one point my friend looked at me and said \"this feels incredibly President's Choice-y\" and I had to concur.

Amuse bouche was a small butternut squash soup and well it was whatever.

The Bad:

I chose the Skate wing just for variety sake and wow was I disappointed. They cooked it straight up with a bit of batter and man it was the epitome if disappointing.  The texture was rough and flaky at parts while being incredibly chewy once in my mouth.

-- 

Oh well, I'm glad I went, because at least now I know what it has to offer. I doubt I'll go back since the city has so much more to offer.

Hell they even screwed up my Rusty Nail."}
{"text":"Went during winterlicious. The view is beautiful , food was okay , display okay , service okay . Overall just alright. Might give it another go next time, just for the view ."}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the most exquisite dining experiences I've ever had
The wine selection is amazing
Ice Wine flights! Cave Spring Cellars!
The menu is far from ordinary but always incredibly delicious an the view-
Can't be beat
If in Toronto--go to Canoe
The best"}
{"text":"Sat at the rail overlooking the kitchen where I could watch and talk with the chefs. It was amazing to be able to watch the food being prepared, plated and be able to ask questions. The staff were exceptional knowledgeable as you would expect and tolerant of my many questions. The food was delicious and the overall theme for the dinner was very interesting. The wine parings were spot on leaving me with a few ideas for my own culinary adventures at home. The service was excellent from all the staff that we interacted with. Finally, the ambiance of the restaurant is hard to beat with the whole skyline opening up before you and glittering away in the early night while savouring a cappuccino. A very memorable  dinner with Margaret and my kids."}
{"text":"I've always heard that canoe is the place to try during winterlicious and absolutely loved it! I made a reservation for Saturday night ( they are open on the weekends for dinner during winterlicious) and we were seated by the windows ( I requested that). Such an awesome view of the city!

We ordered the kale and fennel salad, poached salmon and fois gras for apps, the halibut, Alberta filet and tamarack pork for mains, and the chocolate cake, poached pear and triffle for dessert. While the food was in small portions the flavour was unbelievable! 

The service was mediocre for the type of upscale restaurant it was ( it was not up to steakhouse service standards) but the food and view more then made up for it!


I would highly recommend taking advantage of winterlicious to try out Canoe!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars


My husband and I celebrated my birthday at this restaurant. We went for dinner on a weekday so it was somewhat packed with the \"business types\". I suggest booking a reservation ahead of time. After being ushered to our table, our waiter politely asked if we were celebrating it for a special occasion. I quietly whispered we were celebrating my birthday. That was after I realized I shouldn't have since I didn't want the \"birthday troupe\" coming to our table. But more on that later since this is first and foremost, a food review.

We started off with the Ingersoll Bufala Mozzarella for myself and Seared La Ferme Foie Gras for my husband. I thought my appetizer was good but when I tried the foie gras, I was blown away by the taste and texture. It tasted like butter, well, more like seared butter. I know about the controversy over foie gras but I honestly forgot about it after I tried the dish. Sad to say but I will definitely have this dish again (I will gladly give up shark's fin soup for this!).

My main course was the Acadian Sturgeon with braised ribs, cabbage and potato on the side. If I'm not mistaken, the fish was cooked in such a way that it was neither pan-fried nor grilled. It may have been slow-cooked in something just like how the Iron Chefs do it. The dish was a new experience for me and I loved it. My husband ordered the Dry Aged Ontario Rib eye. He wasn't as impressed with it as how I was with my dish but he did like it.

My dessert, which was the Rolled Butter Tart, was presented with a birthday candle on top and a discreet birthday greeting on the plate. I thought that was a nice gesture without being overdone. Like a true upscale restaurant, no birthday troupe came our way. This was a big relief.

Dining at Canoe is expensive but worth the experience. We will come back to celebrate other special occassions."}
{"text":"If you're trying to \"wow\" your girl or your significant other, take them here! On top of the TD tower downtown, the view at canoe is amazing. 

As one of Oliver & Bonacini Restaurants, yes it is quite pricey but definitely worth the fine dining experience it entails. I came here in July for a surprise date organized by my fiancé, we nearly had the restaurant to ourselves (we arrived at noon) and best seats in the house. For lunch I had a pasta which is no longer on the menu however I stole a few bites from my fiancés aurora chicken supreme with grits and kale which was my favourite of the two dishes. I love grits and the creaminess of it was like I died and went to heaven gurl! 

Definitely want to try going back during summer/winterlicious if available."}
{"text":"My husband and I managed to get a reservation at Canoe during Winterlicious on a Saturday evening.  This was my second time dining there, the first time was lunch with a colleague.  Both times I found the food to be fine, nothing exceptional.  Servings were on the small side although this was expected.  The service was efficient if not rushed.  Our desserts were in front of us after which came the offer of coffee."}
{"text":"Another day, another O&B restaurant. The experiences never disappoint. This is the perfect date restaurant for any fancy/special occasion. 4 stars for everything from the quality of food to the service to the absolutely jaw-dropping VIEWS.

If you're coming here for the 54th floor lookout, make sure you book a reservation weeks ahead. I tried booking a reservation a week ahead and I got the latest possible time slot on OpenTable (9:45PM while the restaurant closes at 10:30PM). Not complaining though cause when we got there it was super lively and definitely did not feel like we were having a late dinner at all. I called earlier that day before dinner to see if there were any cancellations for earlier time slots (there were none) and requested a window seat. To my surprise, they came through with one of the most beautiful views I've ever seen. We got a window table with a full view of the CN Tower facing the West end of the city. 

We started with the Coastal (half dozen) Oysters for our appy. In my opinion, it tasted like any other oyster dish at a fancy restaurant. There was nothing too TOO special about it. For the mains, we got the Pacific Gray Cod (so freaking amazing) and the Quebec Red Stag (even more amazing if that's even possible). I'm usually more of a salmon gal but last night I said hey, we're balling out on this restaurant anyways so why not change it up for once? Thank goodness I was feeling adventurous because that cod was one of the best seafood dishes I've had in my life. No regrets. Nope. Not even for the small portions we got for the price we paid. I don't even need to say much about the Stag because everything about it was just phenomenal. Some of the most unique flavours for both mains I've ever had. For drinks, we got the Melon Madness and Margarita Caliente. Both were good and heavily alcohol-concentrated. I actually felt tipsy after finishing the Melon cocktail. Both tasted like straight vodka the first 3 seconds and then give off a different aftertaste (watermelon for the Melon Madness and mint for the Caliente). For desserts, we got the Chocolate + Nancy's English Mint and the Hazelnut Chocolate Torte. I'm usually not a fan of mint but wow, I think I might be giving mint ice cream a second chance now. The mix of chocolate, white chocolate, and mint cream was simply delicious. I loved the toasted marshmellow bit for the Torte but the cocoa meringue was a bit too rich for my liking. I thought it was super thoughtful how the waiter had asked if we were celebrating anything at the beginning of our meal and drew \"Happy Anniversary\" in chocolate on both of our desserts. A nice touch. We both had the Caramelatte to finish off our meal and I have no other words other than this is a must try. Didn't expect much to be honest, but it was very creamy and sweet on its own without adding any extra sugar. 

Canoe was everything you'd expect from an upscale restaurant in Toronto. Service was impeccable, the ambience in the restaurant was very cozy, and the food is worth coming back for time and time again. Guys, take your ladies here. This is the safest and best choice if you've got the extra bills and want to spoil ya girl."}
{"text":"I proposed at this restaurant and she said yes. So that's an automatic 5 stars. Just joking. Even without the romance, this place deserves a 5 star.

Located on the 50th floor of the TD Tower, this place is a fine place to dine no matter how you look at it. 

First of all, the ambiance is great. You overlook the Toronto waterfront and see a good chunk of the city. The décor is nice. The service is attentive and staff are obviously well trained.

The food is spectacular. They have some pretty original dishes that combine exotic, high quality ingredients. We both had the venison which came with some fruits, cabbage, foie gras sausage, and a good cut of meat. All presented very beautifully on a plate. They serve you bread before the meal and it comes with a specially made sauce that is similar to hummus. 

I cant emphasize enough how good the service is. And I must say I'm generally not the type to care about service. I am quite used to Asian style service. I told them I'm proposing and asked a staff to help take a video. They complied. They gave us complimentary wine (sparkling), and a dessert plate with \"congratulations\" written in chocolate. On the house.

Of course, this is more of a fine dinning restaurant. Prices are not cheap but it's worth it. I would come more often if I can afford it. But currently it's a strong consideration for special occasions."}
{"text":"2017 Winterlicious Lunch Menu Review
Ordered:
1. Appetizer - Heirloom Squash Soup: Amazing Starter. Pumpkin season is over but hey, here's one fall delight that you can get to warm up on a chilly day.

2. Main - BC Keta Salmon (Lunch menu only): The Labrador tea cream is an impeccable feature in this dish. And is it just me or did you not feel like it has a bit of lychee taste to it? For all foodie lovers, slow down and savour this sauce while it dances harmoniously with the smoky wild fish in your mouth. Mmm, mmm, yum.

3. Dessert - Chocolate Fondant: All the chocolatey goodness come together in this dessert. It is less sweet relative to the Sticky Pudding option but is still better off to be enjoyed with a cup of java. C'mon, you prob will need that extra boost of caffeine to avoid hitting food-itis at work afterward. 

Service: Meh, could be better and I didn't expect much. You're getting a discounted 3-course meal at a fancy restaurant in Toronto's financial district. If you want better service, come during their regular times and order from their regular menu. Each course is served only when all patrons have finished the prior one. So chop chop, don't leave your mate(s) waiting! (Yeah, eating fast can be a struggle for a foodie)

Price: Stressful early booking (took two of us to get the table on the first day the reservation opened) and maybe a couple gym workouts for those trying to stay fit. Kidding, just enjoy meal. You're on the 66th floor with an epic lake view!"}
{"text":"I went to Canoe on Sunday for their Summerlicious promotion and it was AMAZING! The menu was definitely a \"best of Canoe\" menu which isn't usually the case for restaurants with Summerlicious promotions. I had the spinach salad followed by the Alberta beef sirloin and the chocolate ganache for dessert. My date had the lamb as an entree which was equally amazing! This place lives up to the hype and is definitely worth the price. Amazing service, ambiance (the view!) and food and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I can't say that my exotic meat was a 5-star experience in terms of entrees, however the foie gras was certainly good.

Overall, food wise I would probably have to give this place a 3-star. It didn't impress me much and it was fairly pricey. 

That being said, the view is absolutely amazing. Come during sunset, you will not believe some of the photos I was able to capture! The height of this restaurant along with its sort of 360ish view really gives you this amazing experience of seeing the smaller Toronto city airport, and all the high rises and the amazing colors during a sunset.

I think presentation was good, the wine was also pretty spot on ... but my entree was just disappointing. The game meat was tough, and the flavors were just not there. I may have had a better time if I ordered ... fish or something. Who knows, definitely a great date spot though!"}
{"text":"We went there for our anniversary.  Overall it was a great experience.   The service was excellent.  The waiter was very attentive and the suggestions he gave for the food were all very good.   At the end when we ordered dessert he even brought out an extra dessert as the one I had ordered we did not like that much.   The appetizers were good. I ordered the steak and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sat night at 10pm for 2 people. It was incredibly tough to make reservations, had to call 6 times because the line were incredibly busy, and even after the call is connected it's still a 20 min wait on hold to speak to a human. I understand the restaurant is Toronto landmark and will likely always be busy. All diners had to order from the $45 prixe-fixe Winterlicious menu.

For Appetizers I had the pork which was like a pate consistency and my wife had the salmon trout. Both were quickly served and were like works of art!

For Mains I had the chicken and my wife the strip loin. My portion was a bit small, with only 2 spoon of the 3 grain risotto would have wanted more. The strip loin was a good 6-8 ounces and was cooked perfectly rare.

For Desert I had the carrot cake and my wife had the three milk cake. Deserts were excellent. My date enjoyed the 3 wine pairing with each course for $20. As we were a late seating the noise level started to die down. The entire Western and Southern walls are glass offering breathtaking views of the city. The private dining spaces are on the Eastern part of the restaurant. The North side of the restaurant, diners can view into the expansive open kitchen. Our server Greg was wonderful and has been with Oliver and Bonacini for 13 years which speaks to how well they treat their employees.
Complimentary coat check and parking validation are welcome bonuses. They seem to cater to the business community, and don't rely on flashy decor to bring in clientele. Will definitely dine here again in future."}
{"text":"Canoe is one of the most coveted \"licious\" venues, so I was very glad to have been able to get a lunch reservation for Winterlicious of 2011. Now I realise that a lot of people say this is not worth the hype, and that might be true if you lay down a lot of money and not end up with a seat next to a 
window etc. 
While my group did not get a window table, our meal was still very nicely done with very attentive and friendly service. Even though this is a 3 star review, I was not unhappy with my overall dining experience, the food however was not as amazing as I expected.
My heart was broken a little when my rabbit entrée came out looking very \"rabbit-leg\" like and matters were not made better when it didn't have a lot of flavour in it either, served with a rather measly portion of veggies. 
But my appetizer and dessert dishes were very well done. 

Unfortunately the weather was not being nice to us and all we could see out the window were low hanging clouds and the occasional glimpse of neighbouring buildings. My sense of direction was totally blown when the side I thought was North turned out a view of the City Centre Airport during a break in the clouds. Would very much like to return on a nice clear day. 

Our server was friendly and did not at all give us a rushed feeling despite it being the peak lunch time. 
Depending on what's on the menu I would most definitely give Canoe a return visit!"}
{"text":"Canoe is a Toronto institution. The views at Canoe are gorgeous. You can enjoy great views of the CN Tower, the city and the islands during your mean. The open kitchen allows you to watch the symphony of energy that goes into preparing your meal and adds to the atmosphere. 

The menu plays homage to some of the finest ingredients found in various regions in Canada. The dishes (appetizers, entree and dessert) were all well prepared. The dishes were well thought out and flavourful. However, given the price and the other options in Toronto, I did not give Canoe full points. 

The service was attentive. It is the service that you would expect of such a ritzy restaurant."}
{"text":"All that is good has already been said about Canoe. The food was excellent (Steak Tartare app, Lamb loin for dinner) and the serve was certainly attentive. 

You are paying some for the name and location. Dinner for two, with a half-bottle and tip was close to $300. And it wasn't twice as good as the average place you can eat for $150. The view was great and I'm glad we went, but it's certainly not a place I think I'd be going to on a regular basis. 

The mix of dress was interesting too, three piece suits all the way down to jeans. Still have yet to find a place in Toronto that enforces a dress code."}
{"text":"I only ever went here for summer and winter licious - the foods were great, I think they were exactly the same menu for both season. What really amazes me about this place is their staff (just so you know I am being sarcastic). We were seated at the exact same location for both season and got the same waiter! HA! Both occasion I was with my boyfriend, the first time I went, my bf was wearing casual clothing (jeans+polo shirt) and got completely ignored the whole time by our waiter - as if I was the only one dining. We thought it was funny and wanted to experiment and went back again, this time my bf was business attire no tie - my oh my! same waiter, same spot - but this time, my bf was acknowledge almost right away. Isn't it crazy? because of that I dont think I would come back."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicous and the menu was great.  The appetizer was yummy and the main was good.  The dessert was not great.  Can't complain since the price for Summerlicious is much cheaper than it would be just ordering off the regular menu.  

The restaurant had a nice ambiance, great decor, and great view of the city on the 54th floor if you were seated at the window.  The waiter was great - my husband was not sure which glass of wine to order and the waiter offered a small tasting of the two types of wine he was trying to decide on. We never had or was offered that at other fine dining restaurants.  Our reservation was for 9:00pm and the restaurant was full."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of michelin star restaurants in new york and was far from impressed. I decided to give canoe a try for my anniversay and I couldn't be happier with the service I got. Our server had great attention to detail always looking for subtle hints that we were waiting or ready to transition to our next dish. 

We started with the seafood platter which had assorted oysters, prawns etc. Although I'm not giving this platter any justice with my description it was epic. Everything tasted fresh and amazing. 

The entrees were spot on and the dessert was delicious. Really appreciated the creativity of mixing bold flavors."}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend took me here for an anniversary dinner and Canoe didn't disappoint. I'm always weary of upscale restaurants serving just mediocre food but it's very much worth the price here.

We got the raw bar which was phenomenal - my boyfriend and I still talk about it. I had the steak and it was the best steak I've ever eaten at a restaurant. 

The service was also friendly and attentive. I'll admit, I felt a little intimidated as we are a younger couple but they treated us very well and with respect. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Perhaps not my cup of tea but overall experience was just mediocre.  I had booked a month in advance through opentable.com but had no option to select seating.  When I arrived I had asked to be moved to a window area but the place was all reserved already (any tips on how to reserve a window seat? Do I need to actually call in?).  The servers and host were very friendly.  They have free coat check so that is a great plus in the winter time.  The decor is nothing fancy and the ceiling was odd (not finished or they just expect no one to look up).  The seating was spacious.

The food was just okay.  Again maybe not my cup of tea.  The menu is concise and not too complicated so you can make your choices easy.  I ordered the lamb and it was very well flavoured and a good option if you are debating between the options. The pasta was less than impressive.  The ratio of pasta, sauce, and bison was too heavily shifted towards the pasta side.  Lastly I also got the mushroom soup which was flavuorful and great way to start the meal.  2 out of 3 isn't that bad but the pasta still lingers.

I wish I had the view as that is definitely one of the best features of the place.  Maybe if I do return I will try to get the view and that may elevate the overall experience.  I will write another review if I do come back.  

Overall, try if you want.  Try to get the view.  Perhaps you'll have a better experience than I did."}
{"text":"The thing about Canoe is, unless you are older and wealthy (or ordering above 300$) the service will be awful. I cam here for a special occasion after coming here for work events and several dinners with large groups, apparently if you come here and you are young even if you order wine and food. You will have terribke service! I loved it here in my previous experiences when I came with groups, so I chose to come here for a romantic evening.

We were not stingy on our food selection and we ordered wine, our waiter couldn't be done with us sooner. A tremendous disappointed."}
{"text":"First lunch for Summerlicious 2015. Had pottage of peach and corn cream soup, pasta (don't remember the exact name) and chocolate cake. View the perfect. It is such a nice day. If for summerlicious menu, I would recommend the corn soup, short ribs and apricot mousse."}
{"text":"If I didn't crave for a variety of different cuisines, and a change of scenery, I'd be a regular here. 

As expected, service, quality and atmosphere didn't disappoint, but (and this is an extremely minor suggestion to the restaurant) the chairs either need a wash or replacement. It's definitely not TTC level of cleanliness, but it's not exactly what one should be exposed to at this calibre of establishment."}
{"text":"Canoe never disappoints me. From the second I walk in with the view, even on a gloomy day.

Appetizer: Cured rainbow trout, nori, Taramasalata,
Ink cracker and seaweed persillade. 

It was a good portion for appetizer and the flavours were good.

Albacore tuna, at first when I saw licorice potatoe, I wasn't looking forward as I don't like licorice at all. I even asked if I can substitute.  However they told me that it's very light. The flavour was very unique and went surprisingly well with the potatoe. The holland marsh leeks was tasty and fresh. This plate usually have all the ingredients that I don't like but turned out well.

I find my mint chocolate torte was a bit dried so I tried my friends lemon tarte. It was much better. Again service was great, will come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic always, great view, open kitchen

Thankfully I am always a guest so I enjoy my meals even more!  :-)

Definitely a gem in Toronto and memorable experience.

I have dined here several times with small and large groups.  This place has always been phenomenal. Glad that it's in Toronto and not Vancouver!"}
{"text":"Review for Winterlicious 

YUMMMMM! 

In general, I am a little sceptical regarding Winterlicious at finer establishments after having a disastrous encounter at another top restaurant during a summerlicious (2 years ago). 

Service: excellent...very attentive and knowledgeable. Everything you would expect from such an establishment. 

The view: Wow! So gorgeous, breathtaking! 

Food:

I had GF bread and can I say it was out of this world! Served with roast vegetable puree; yum!

Pork Rillettes: rich and creamy, although I think I would have opted for the soup as the rest . Cider jelly added a rather interesting texture.

Roasted Squash and Parsnip soup was a hit with my friends.

We all had the Duo of Beef: my experience of this was good! Perfectly cooked....medium rare, served with braised beef which was flavourful. Caramelized braised onions so tasty. 

In dessert wise we tried 3:

Maple Gingerbread; extremely moist and the scorched creme anglaise was heavenly.

Chocolate pana cotta; creamy and perfectly spiced. Not too rich.

The winner was the almond cake and salted caramel ice cream...divine. I wanted to run to the kitchen and make off with the whole lot of ice cream. 

I had images of the ice cream and I in a Thelma and Louise style escape...only less death and more gluttony. 

Cocktails; have the winter sangria...think chilled mulled wine; super sexy!

Overall fantastic dining experience"}
{"text":"The view is one of the nicest in all of downtown Toronto. I suggest only going for the view and drinks at the bar. The food is not worth it. Been twice and both times the food and service were disappointing. Portions are tiny of course and for the quality, overpriced. If the food actually tasted good, it would justify the price. Steaks are chewy and tasteless. Is this a high end restaurant or the Keg? Waiters were subtlety rude and one even appeared flustered when we asked to order coffees after he brought us the bill. Sorry we changed our minds and wanted to order more. Unacceptable for a high end restaurant. Maybe they prefer to serve old money folks rather than young. Not going back."}
{"text":"Excellent. Fantabulous. Outstanding.
These are the words that comes to my mind when I think about Canoe. This place oozes with sheer class and panache.

We went there to celebrate our anniversary, and we had to do reservation one day in advance with a special request for a window seat. And they were gracious enough to give us a seat by the window overlooking the skyline. The view was breathtaking to say the least.
In the food perspective I loved the variety they brought in the menu. Actually this was probably the only place where we found Venison which actually is a rarity as most places are content with chicken, beef & pork.
So, we went ahead and ordered the Venison, though with little reluctance initially. But, boy!! The dish simply blew me over. We asked for Medium Rare and it was perfectly done with the right amount of redness inside and top of it, It came with an adequate portion of foie gras which was stupendous and the best we had. And I am not being generous at all.
The dessert was equally awesome with Happy Anniversary written on it and we loved this gesture.

Though, it is little bit on the pricier side, but at the end, each dime spent is well worth it and if you ask me, for any special occasion or celebration, this is THE place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our 9 year anniversary we had the summerlicious menu !! I had very high expectations for this place lots of friends have tell me that they've had their best meals of their lives here .... Mmm not me food was forgettable I ordered  the cold corn chowder it was ok my husband ordered the Bufala mozzarella also ok , for mains we ordered  strip loin and lamb which were ok nothing memorable dessert very disappointing I don't mind the small portions but nothing to have dreams about not worth the price even for summerlicious the only highlight it was Their sangria  !! But then again is not worth the price !"}
{"text":"Looks like a fancy beige cafeteria from the 70s. Seems to think it doesn't have to try to impress you. Food almost great but not quite there in the details. Skin on the fish was not crispy. 3 different waiters who all looked harried.  For the amount of money you spend it should all be just better."}
{"text":"Came here with a group last month to celebrate.  The service was very attentive and helpful when it came to describing dishes and wines.  Most of our table decided to order the prix fix menu with the wine pairings - overall a pretty good value.  (I think it was $150 CN per person)

The dishes themselves are quite small...but they're tasty!  The accompanying pours of wine were very generous...some of us at the table couldn't finish the wine!  It was interesting to hear about the origin of the foods, and why the chef created certain dishes.  This definitely made the overall experience better.  I could have had a more substantial dessert, but I supposed I could stand to lower my caloric intake!

4/5 stars for the size and balance of the food with the wine.

The view is very nice and just adds even more to the great experience."}
{"text":"this place is straight corporate, i brought my wife one night there and maybe i'm of the simpier folk o r at least good home cooking, and this aint...the  gave some weird salad, some weird pasta, and some weird meat, by the time you know it the bill was $250 for two, my wife didnt even touch her food because it sucked. and we went to another restaurant to eat after we left there... do not recomend...only if your boss on Bay st is paying....."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary for the first time and we were greeted right away. The decor of the restaurant is not as modernized as expected but it doesn't change how great our experience was here. This is probably the most funny thing that elevated our experience. There is a lot of people that work here, a lot of people with different jobs. So at one point we didn't even know who was our waiter and who was who. Everyone was really attentive and shared lots of details about each dish we had. We had the s'mores foie gras to the duck as the entree. It was so delicious and for the quality of the food the price was definitely worth it! I did request for a window seat since it was our anniversary but unfortunately they couldn't save it for us which is fine. But considering how much money we spent it would had been nice to sit with a view."}
{"text":"Overall the food was good but there isn't really anything I had that I would come back for.

So fancy this place doesn't have signage on the building.  Once you enter the building, you'll see a sign mounted to the wall by the elevators telling you Canoe is on the 54th floor.  There's a bar area that has a separate entrance from the restaurant area.  The view from the top is pretty nice and you can see the CN tower if you're sitting on the lower level of the restaurant.

This place has a great fine dining atmosphere.  The décor is classy and the chairs are comfortable.  When you get up from your seat, your napkin is magically folded and placed on the table upon your return.  There weren't too many things on the menu that excited me, yet I still wanted to try everything.  In addition to the a la cart menu, they have a tasting menu for $100/person.  Items on the tasting menu can also be ordered a la cart.  The food was good, with the foie gras and the side of cream corn being the most memorable.  I read great reviews on some of the desserts, but unfortunately they were no longer on the menu.  

FOOD
Raw Bar $72 - East and West Coast seafood platter (good for sharing 2-3 people) - There were about 10 different things to try on this platter, most of which I couldn't keep track of what they were.  I think a little labeling or cheat cheat would be nice instead of asking the waiter about each time again.  There was tuna tartare, salmon tartare, scallops with foam, popcorn (which you're supposed to eat after the scallops), shrimp, swordfish, oysters and salmon pate.  

Northern woods mushroom soup $16 - My friend didn't enjoy the truffle flavors in this soup as much as I did.  It was simple, good, but boring.  I wouldn't want more than a few spoonfuls of this.

Pan Seared Quebec Foie Gras $28 - lavender peaches, Ontario peanuts, and toasted bulrush brioche - The foie gras was done just right and tasted great.  I really enjoyed the peanut sauce with crunchy pieces of nuts.  The brioche was ok, but found that I rather eat and taste the foie gras on its own and then eat everything else separately.  You can share this among 4 people, but realistically, you'd want the entire appetizer to yourself.  Even more realistically, you should order 2 and have it as a main.

Tea Smoked Duck Breast $43 - Northern Woods mushrooms, pickled wild leek, rapini and 3 grain porridge - I went with the recommended medium rare and it looked beautiful.  I'm not sure if I was too stuffed to enjoy this dish by the time I got it, but it was just AOK.  

Alberta Labm $47 Strawberry BBQ ribs, roasted loin, eggplant, and sumac sheep's cream - My lamb loving friend that ordered this dish loved it.  I'm not a lamb lover and thought it was too lamby when I tried a bite.

Creamed Ontario Corn and Shallot Rings $8 - This creamy corn side was terrific!  It came in a bowl with a pile of husk on top.  I didn't even know you can eat husk and I didn't know that eating it could be so delicious.  One of my favorites of the night.

Desserts $12 - I got to try a bunch of desserts and my favorite of the bunch was the recommended butter tart.  The small scoop of ice cream was my favorite part on each of the desserts.
-Classic Canoe Butter Tart - smoked vanilla cream, flax seed, nougatine, rye and ginger ice cream.
-Milk Chocolate and kernal peanut - 46% milk chocolate, banana butter and caramel ice cream
-Chocolate Torte - Okanagan hazelnul, praline and ovaltine ice cream
-Roasted Niagara Peaches - Candied violet, chamomile, cream cheese and yoghurt mousse

There were many options for red wine by the glass but the only Cabernet Sauvignon was the Lotus Cab for $16.  It was pretty good."}
{"text":"You get a solid view of the CN tower and the lake, but the food here for Winterlicious at least, is just average. The presentation was nice though. If you're looking to sample the Canoe menu for cheap, try coming here for lunch for Summerlicious/Winterlicious. Three courses for $28 and a nice ambience isn't a bad way to get together with friends. Make sure you book ahead though, spots here fill up quite fast!"}
{"text":"Solid special occasion restaurant , went as a party of five for two senior birthday celebrations. Everyone enjoyed the view. Had the tasting menu with wine pairing for $160 approx per person , a bit too much alcohol for me, I had to give glasses away. Started with a lovely presented oyster that was ok but nothing fabulous, we are in Toronto after all. Pasta course was good , lamb app and venison main dishes were well done although there was a puff pastry rabbit thing served with the venison which had only a smear of rabbit stew in my serving, fellow diners claimed to have gotten more. Dessert was just so so, nothing special. It's good solid Canadian food and the location cannot be beat. Loved seeing the view in daylight and night with all the lights. One of our diners stepped away from the table and a course was served , their plate got covered by a cloche and a waiter stood by the table waiting for the member of our group to return and then lifted the cloche. Despite this level of service , the restaurant is not at all stuffy."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favourite restaurant in Toronto! I've been here 5x (and counting), each time I am never disappointed and my expectations are always exceeded. Pretty long review, but bear with me - such a great place needs a pretty detailed review to try and convince you to go! :)

My favourite things about this restaurant are:

(1) The fact that it's cuisine is \"Canadian\" because they source out fresh and local Canadian foods. 

(2) Menu is ever changing, I haven't had the same thing twice though I do have my favourites - but dishes can be similar with the same great experience for your taste buds. Broad wine selection (a bit pricey but thats expected) and great recommendations for pairings for each course. 

(3) Portions are not large, but they aren't tiny despite what some may expect from a high-end restaurant (especially for Winter/Summer-licious). The portions of each course are perfect so that you are satisfied (but disappointed its over; I always want their meals to last forever) at the end of the meal, but not overly full and bloated haha.  

(4) Atmosphere for both lunch and dinner has the perfect mixture of a classy & upscale feel but is also cozy & intimate. You'll never get tired of the view atop the 54th floor of the Toronto Dominion Building; breath-taking.

(5) Service is great, food comes out promptly with a description of each dish from the knowledgeable staff.

When reserving for Winterlicious/Summerlicious, I suggest that you get yourself an Amex or borrow (legally :p) someone's Amex number so that you can get a 2 day head start above the competition. Reservations can book up ridiculously quick, so even if you get a weird time to eat, consider yourself very lucky! If its possible, ask for a table near the side windows near the kitchen. You can see people hard at work in the open style kitchen and a lot more of Toronto in all its beauty. Though you can see more of Toronto during the day, dinner time is the nicest time to go because you can see all the buildings lit up. 

Although some see it as a negative, the substantial bill at the end is completely worth the experience you'll have at Canoe! It's not somewhere I'd go on a regular basis (once or twice/year), but I think that adds to how special it makes the meal & experience. So if you want to celebrate something special or to just indulge yourself, you definitely need to eat here! Save up, if you must but you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place has everything to make my birthday special...the wine, food and service was great. I had duck breast as main course which was well cooked with great flavors. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had read about this restaurant and was thrilled to have gotten a last minute reservation for a Saturday night. 

The first thing you notice when you are shown your table is the view- Hello Toronto! We were on vacation and decided to get ourselves something with bubbles in it. Low and behold there was local sparkling wine. Yes please. And that's rather the gist of Canoe- local, local, local. I should probably add delicious. The only problem I found was that everything on the menu sounded like you needed to order it...even the bread they start you out with was darned delish. We did try the mushroom soup and I found it to be a little salty. The salmon starter made me fall in love with salmon all over again. I had the strip loin- plate could have been reused I polished that sucker. My sister had the Sturgeon and beef cheeks. I'm a sucker for any kind of cheeks and these were gorgeous.

I should note too that service was really outstanding. It was a little slow getting our server to the table but once he could concentrate on us he didn't disappoint. He even went to far as to get us addresses of other bakeries and restaurants that we could enjoy more local delights. 

Such a great experience."}
{"text":"This was my third visit, the first with a small party. My previous thoughts had been that this restaurant had traded off its location.....and the rest was ho hum....

Well my view all changed on this visit. We had great seats where we could watch the sun set and we could see all the way from Billy Bishop Airport to Mississauga and the horizon. All great scene setting.

Our welcome was professional and pre dinner drinks were efficiently served. Excellent waiter attention followed where the fine line was well executed...splendid service.

The starters and mains were popular and all received 'rave reviews' from around the table. It was the case of 10 out of 10....in my experience a rare occurrence. The delivery of consistency is the fact that I most commonly feel let down over and here it was not the case. The red meats all came out exactly as requested, the fish too was perfect.....not tricked up either. Grilled fish that was served as outstandingly grilled....and the Pork Loin was described as simply devine....

It has a quality wine list that covers the globe.....

We did not venture into the desert menu as we had all had ample sufficiency...

A real restaurant delivering and performing at the high end......expensive yes, however you pay for what you get."}
{"text":"They forgot the petit fours (how do you forget?!).

Canoe isn't open on weekends. Or at least that's what the concierge told us, so we had a reservation for late Monday night. Nabbed a seat with a spectacular view of the CN tower. Good food but not spectacular, but really great view and good service. There is an open view of the kitchen in the back. And the chairs are fuzzy.

Had the tasting menu paired with cocktails (I don't think I've seen a pairing with cocktails before). Started off with ham for the amuse bouche with a rather mild but good nama nama sake. The cold poached hen was okay, but I'm not the biggest fan of that style of cooking. The fire roasted lobster was surprisingly sweet from the corn accompaniment, and I can't say I've ever eaten cattail before. I questioned the waiter where the lobsters were sourced from, but neither he nor anyone else in the kitchen was able to answer.

The pickerel was decent, and I really liked the mustard sauce. The dessert was rather underwhelming -- too much marshmallow! Like I mentioned before, the waiter forgot to bring us the petit fours.

I'd probably return if I were in the area, but the view accounts for a good chunk of that decision."}
{"text":"Lovely place for a special occasion or date night. Good views as it's in the TD tower and on some super high floor. Service is always amazing with the $$$ restaurants. You can expect small portions here and to be almost full if you get alcohol, appetizer, main and dessert. I'm not sure if they always switch up their menu but my recommendation would be the braised duck with pot stickers and the foie gras chocolate dessert - so good."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!

I was dining alone on a Thursday night and was ready for everthing I'd heard about this place.

At first I was sat in what was maybe not the best seat, with the water pitchers and register by my head and was starting fill with dread about the evening when no one came to bring water or explain the menu.

The Sommelier wisked into action and found me the most wonderful table in the center of the room with a view, and gave me a glass of champagne for my wait.

From there I went forth into the tasting menu with wine parings and was truly thrilled by each course. The scallop ceviche was astounding and felt as if it was just scooped from perfect waters.

Before the intermezzo the Sommelier toldme they were bringing me something special, again...for my wait.

They brought an entire extra course of their mouth-watering Fois Gras with a special wine pairing, which was something on the regular menu I was eyeing.

The Venison was cooked to perfection without any sharp flavours.

All in all, a prefect meal with a wonderful Sommelier, a talented and stunning waiter....and just a wonderful memory!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not really on par with other Prix Fixe wine pairing meals I've had. Canoe is located on too of the TD tower and the views were stunning. Its sister restaurant, Auberge du Pommier had better reviews but we opted for Canoe based on the views and were not let down. The ambience is a bit different, however. It wasn't as quiet as I was hoping for. 

The meal itself was interesting. I had their chocolate themed meal, which was unsurprisingly inventive. The chocolate wasn't overbearing, though it was a bit subtle with the venison.  Though the dishes were interesting, I just didn't feel that they were memorable enough to justify the cost. 

The wine pairing was hit or miss. I didn't care for some of the choices.  The other issue is that sometimes the wine serving didn't match up with the food. Sometimes we would get the meal and have to wait for the wine (though never more than 4 minutes). Nevertheless, the servers were courteous and relatively attentive. 

Overall, the meal was a solid B. The view was spectacular though the restaurant was a tad noisy. The dishes were interesting but didn't really feel worth the $100 and the wine pairing was pretty hit or miss and timing wise didn't coincide with the dishes very well. The service was otherwise good though."}
{"text":"The view here is great if you get a window seat. the food is pricey and not worth it, I'd rather go to a restaurant downstairs in this area with less of a view; but much better food. I always bring friends from out of town here for the view, but they are not amazed at the food. It one of those places you go once, just to try it and not return."}
{"text":"Terrance, our server, made our experience. 

My date and I are particular, sometimes too demanding, when it comes to diet restrictions, wine selection, seasoning etc. At no point did we get attitude, only impeccable service... and gorgeous views of downtown Toronto and Lake Ontario. 

Food-wise, the \"northern woods mushroom soup with balsam fir crème fraîche + toasted camelina seeds\" is highly recommended and has stayed on the menu since opening in 1995. As a gluten and grain-free vegan, I was offered a veggie medley (a mix of starches, pickled, raw), so satiating, I took half my main home.

We will return soon...."}
{"text":"Made a reservation but still had to wait maybe 10 to 15 minutes for a table, despite being after the lunch rush. A bit pricey for lunch, but it's expected for a dining experience of this caliber.

Service: Waiter was fairly attentive, although it took a while to take our orders. Was seated near a window, as requested when I made my reservation. View would definitely be nicer during the summer months. The waiter/waitress that brought each dish would explain what I was eating, a very nice touch!

Food: This was definitely more than just food, it was a dining experience. The complimentary in-house made bread with tomato puree humus was very fresh, as the bread was still warm. The maple cured salmon + fogo island crab appetizer was very rich, with the taste of creamy avocado and salmon tartare, but only very small portion of crab. The braised tamarack lamb was so tender it could be cut with a fork, although it was a little on the salty side. Each dish was also plated very beautifully, almost like artwork.

Overall: Amazing dining experience with a view, but make a reservation before-hand and kindly ask for a table with a view. Also, coat check is done before walking into the dining area."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a couple of weeks ago to celebrate a friend's birthday. The good: 1) The view from our table was awesome, and 2) the service was excellent. The bad: 1) The signage is seriously lacking, 2) the menu choices were lacking, and 3) the food was not good. I ordered a mushroom soup to start that was pretty horrendous. For my main course, I ordered the halibut. It was undercooked and covered in a disgusting green sauce. By the time I got back to my hotel room, I was actually sick. Honestly, the bread served before dinner was the best part of the meal. For the price, I expected something pretty special. The whole experience was terribly disappointing."}
{"text":"As a tourist, we wanted a meal with a view and were too last minute to book the CN 360 restuarant. I'm glad we made it here instead. Although I felt a little nervous walking in, that maybe it was going to be too pretentious and stuffy, our awesome waiter (who's name I have sadly forgotten!!) turned the night into one of the best dining experiences we have had. We had a table up on a dias with a view and were served our drinks promptly. We decided on the salmon appetizer right away but had some questions on the main dishes. Our server could not have been more knowledgeable and enthusiastic! He wasn't reciting anything either, he was just gushing about the food off the top of his head. The salmon was delicious and so was the aged ribeye. The lamb was a mix of many types of lamb and some were better than others but all were good. Our server recommended the bread pudding for dessert which is not anything we have ordered before but we really trusted him at this point so we went with it. It was the best part of the whole meal! So delicious, I comtemplated ordering another one! Every aspect of the dinner was meticulous with staff coming around to straighten silverware or refill waters instantly. The preserved cherry in my drink was house made in bourban from a local organic cherry and even IT was delicious. We made the right choice in Canoe for our special date night!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch last week to celebrate a birthday. I've been here years before but haven't come back since. The menu had a small selection of appetizers and mains but the food is outstanding. I had a mojito cocktail and it was a little strong but good flavours. We ordered the maple cured salmon and fogo island crab, burrata appetizers and for mains the halibut and the tuna special. Plating was exquisite and great pairings in taste and texture for each menu item. Loved the salmon and crab appetizer. Smoked salmon was prepared slightly candied and firm texture and went well with the crab and smoked avocado. Burrata was so soft and delicious and interesting squid ink chip. Halibut was amazing so fresh and seared just right and came with a crab meat spring roll. Good portions for everything. We had the chocolate flourless cake and English mint and this did not fail to impress either. My compliments to the chef and OB. Fantastic restaurant even after so many years."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them a better rating so i took couple weeks to really think about this place... but..... my conclusion...is this..

canoe was good
i don't think it lives up to it's hype tho
service was excellent, martini was good, food was good..
nothing to complain, but nothing really stood out i don't think.... i wasn't doing back flips nor having crazy desire to go back ..
The view was good, but i think the view from my condo in vancouver is far more breath taking... i wouldn't make this a regular spot.."}
{"text":"Located on the 54th floor of the Toronto Domnion Tower (TD Tower). I went into the TD Bank Tower, and was pretty confused because I didn't see the 54th floor. Turns out when I asked the receptionist, I'm not the only one who makes this mistake.

Heading up the elevator, Canoe was easy to find, we made a reception and were seating right away. The waitress asked if we were celebrating anything special, I'm pretty sure if we were there to celebrate they would bring out a cute little celebratory dish decorated with fancy words.

The atmosphere was definitely a business casual type of setting. We did not go during Winterlicious or Summerlicious, so we had the regular menu. We were served with warm bread with delicious oil. In addition, we were asked if we wanted more bread after. We ordered some coastal half dozen oysters, which were delicious. They were well cleaned, I didn't taste any sand in them.  

In between the appetizer and the main course, we were given a special small dish to cleanse our taste buds. It was really refreshing!

For the mains, I got the Canadian barley risotto. It was definitely a small portion, but I enjoyed EVERY bite of it. The risotto was so smooth and lightly chewy. The complimentary herbs and sauces mixed really well together.

We decided to eat dessert elsewhere, and even though we did not want any dessert, they gave us a complimentary bite sized cake which was also great quality food.  

Canoe is one fine Oliver and Bonacini restaurant with delicious food and a marvelous view."}
{"text":"Absolute gem of a restaurant! Food was amazing and the view was beautiful. 
Food portions were a little small but other than that, they tasted great and had very nice presentation. 
I ordered the Great Lakes pickeral and had the apple terrine for dessert.
The birch and sunchoke ice cream was PHENOMENAL and would return just for that! 
Service was amazing as well. Our server was constantly coming to our table to make sure everything was okay and even gave us small tasters (of duck tartare) before our meal came. Staff was super friendly and accommodating. 
Overall, it was a great restaurant and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Last week dined out on 54th floor TD Tower,Canoe restaurant.We ordered BC Oyster n foie gras as appetizers go with Champagne,ordered rockfish n Alberta lamb as mains,go with Burgundy Pinot Noir.What a wonderful dining experience. If you wanna treat someone well, pls take them to here. It has nice amazing view of Toronto and high quality food for us to enjoy it ."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  My wife and I were here for their 2018 Winterlicious lunch meal, and had a great time.  Server was attentive but not too over bearing. Appetizers were salmon and foie gras parfait, both were very good. For main course, we both had beef short rib which was done to perfection. It came with grilled brussel sprouts, red cabbage, and crouton chips. For the dessert, we had the praline cake and poached pear. My only issue for the entire meal was the pear, which i find overly sweet due to the honey dressing.

This was our second time to Canoe, and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely beautiful! A friend's wedding reception was in a private room and the view was perfect, as was the food and wine. 

It was great to try something new - duck, lamb, foie gras - no complaint from anyone in attendance!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Lemme just first start out saying. Gorgeous view of the lake, airport and Rogers center. It was so pretty, like Oh My Gawddddd. The venue is small, but intimate, dark lighting romantic vibe. The service was great. Loved our server, too bad I didn't catch the name after he said it twice, terrible memory. We were sitting right by the windows across Rogers Centre around 10pm. The city lights looked so nice. 

We stared at the menu for a bit. Didn't know what to get for dinner. Started out with few mixed drinks. French Martinis and Vodka Crans with 2 Lemon Waters. We finally picked the Great Lakes Pickeral with iron fist potatoes, seaweed or some dark green vegetable along with a tangerine sauce and another mustard dressing too. Loved the tangerine sauce. Tasted so good, I almost dipped my fish in it too often, finished so quickly :( lol They also bring 2 types of bread options on the table with orangey cheese sauce. It tasted sweet. The potatoes were cooked perfectly, I didn't really like the dark green Vegs.The fish itself, I haven't eaten fish for years and years, almost 17 except for that thin slice of snapper on my sushi few weeks ago. This was my first legit fish dish, glad I took my long awaited fish virginity at Canoe. It tasted pretty good. For whatever dish you choose,,ask your server to recommend the best wine for it. I don't know the name of the white wine we got paired with, but it worked well. 

For dessert, we got toffee custard pudding and \"something panna cotta\" (forgot the real menu names) Toffee one was amazing, tasted way better then the other one, side note, on my dessert plate, they wrote my name with Happy New Years! How adorable. 

Lovely dining experience, prolly one of my best:)"}
{"text":"We haven't dined at Canoe in 3 years and felt we were overdue for a revisit, to see if one of Toronto's \"old guard\", the flagship of the Oliver-Bonacini empire, is still shining in this new era of dining.  No surprise, they did not disappoint, and are not resting on previous laurels, they have kept up and will be around for decades.

Canoe's specialty has always been French/Continental cuisine featuring Canadian ingredients, and they always show excellence in its execution.  How do you top what was already a memorable experience last time?  Get the tasting menu! (which wasn't available last time).  For about what it would cost to order 3 courses (starter, main, dessert) we got a 7 course procession of food with a common theme and came with a nice lesson in Canadian history.

The theme of the winter 2017 tasting menu is \"Great Lakes - a culinary voyage through the history of Canada's iconic fresh waters\".  Rather than relying so much on exotic foreign ingredients, this was a nice way to experience locally sourced product at its best.  We started off with surf clams from the St. Lawrence River, then Georgian Bay smoked whitefish and roe, ramps, and cattail crackers, then a soup consisting of squash bouillon over wild rice, corn dumplings, and heirloom beans. An amuse-bouche of sweet wintergreen granita was an excellent, refreshing palate cleanser to set things up for the homestretch. For the main course, the venison was cooked perfectly -- rare, with highbush cranberries, beets, swiss chard, and rabbit pot pie (bite size like a potsticker!).  Dessert was in 2 stages, first a pear poached in mulled wine accompanied by buttermilk sherbet (which can be described as the best soft-serve ice cream ever), then the finale, a block of maple fudge wrapped in cotton candy!  Wow.  

Word of advice - don't expect the website menu to describe every course, as at least 2 of these courses were not printed.  Just order the tasting menu, sit back and enjoy the experience, carefully curated and mapped out by the talented Oliver-Bonacini team of chefs.  As I said before, definitely avoid Licious. See all those 3-star reviews here?  They're all Winterlicious and Summerlicious cheapskates.  You want the real 5-star meal deal, save up your money until you can get the tasting menu.  Don't waste the trip, Canoe is a destination to be cherished.  Why set yourself up for disappointment.  Come after dark and enjoy the city lights from 54 storeys up, or for a special treat, make a reservation at dusk and watch the sun set.   It's nice to see a restaurant that opened in the 1990's still going strong today and not losing any ground (or have to resort to Groupon).  Food trends come and go but classics never get old and Canoe is proof of that."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 3 and chose the tasting menu for the evening. The food was great, if a little underwhelming. I expected to be blown away by an inventive menu expertly prepared, and i found myself unimpressed due to my high expectations. If i hadn't gone in expecting a meal up to thus restaurants reputation I probably would have been far happier, but overall due to my knowledge of what the CAN deliver I was left disappointed. Fir those looking for a beautiful view and good food this is a great choice, and their East-Coast themed meal was a welcome experience in Toronto. Sea-food, fiddleheads, and Lobster...East coast at its best"}
{"text":"AWESOME food! 

Although I could not eat the oysters--I can not deal with raw oysters! 
I tried! 

You cannot get a better view--absolutely fabulous- at the top of the tower. It is an incredible view of the city!

Fabulous service!

This is a MUST in Toronto!"}
{"text":"May be the best restaurant in Toronto.  Views of the city make this a great spot for a visitor.  Food is beautiful, very well prepared.  Wine list is exceptional.  Restaurant visbly pleasing, wait staff on top of their game.  The only negatives - parking; it's a hike into the building; toilets are way outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 4.5 stars because of the location and ambiance.  This is very trendy and full of good looking people.  The view of the city is breathtaking so when you make a reservation, make sure you get a seat by the window (I unfortunately, didn't know that when I booked my table).

The food is presented beautifully.  I loved everything I ordered except, not so much the chilled cucumber scallop soup. But maybe my palate was not as developed back then (3 years ago).  I'll have to go back and try again.

Use the \"summerlicious\" or \"winterlicious\" program to get a great deal on a three course meal."}
{"text":"The service and location were excellent. I really enjoyed the mushroom soup and dessert (we selected four of the five). For the entrees, the portions are rather small and the flavors were not particularly noteworthy. In particular, the steak was undersalted - all in the party were in agreement with this."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary with my boyfriend at 10:30pm (final seating). We made a reservation a month ahead of time to guarantee a window table.  As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by extremely friendly servers and hostesses. We looked online ahead of time to see the menu, so we ordered before the kitchens closed. 

The atmosphere was amazing and the view was stunning. The place itself is really nice and fancy. Everyone wore suits and dresses in the evening. 

The food came within 10-15 minutes, decently fast, but in my opinion all of their menu is extremely overpriced. My boyfriend ordered the Ontario beef rib eye, and I ordered the northern woods mushroom soup with a side of pan roasted carrots. 

The steak was tasty, as were the carrots, but the soup was just strange to me. It's texture is very gritty and not very soup like, I did not enjoy it because of that. 

This place is nice for special occasions, birthdays, anniversaries, etc...or maybe if you're trying to impress a girl. ;)

Overall lovely experience, but too overpriced."}
{"text":"AMAZING date spot! The top of the TD at night (ask for a window-side table) has beautiful view of the city. We each ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings. The food was great, but what really made the meL in our opinion were the pairings. Most done with small output Canadian vintners you'd rarely find at the LCBO. Also, although not cheap, the price for set menu and wine pairings is definitely fair and not over-priced when compared to similar quality places. Also, just as others mentioned, the cheese plate was wonderful :)

If you're looking to impress the date, you can count on Canoe!"}
{"text":"Summerlicious success! 
Wonderful service, great food, amazing view. 

Food wise: My wife was less impressed with her meal (chilled soup app was apparently not great after the first few bites, and the sauce in the fried trout was spicier than expected and a bit heartburn inducing), but I was very impressed with my meal from start to finish. 
The Bison Bavette with Short Rib was great. The bison on its own was a bit meh, but when combined with the shortrib and some of the acccompanying vegetables was pure flavour magic. I had the Coffee Chocolate Gateau for dessert which was just a great way to end the meal. So rich, so tasty. The banana cremeaux was unreal and when mixed with the brownies was epic.

In review: If I had've paid full price for the 3 courses, I'd probably be more likely to give 4 stars and be more nitpicky... But given a table for 2 with a decent bottle of wine and tip came to a bit over $200, my expectations were fully met and 5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, so much I rented out the place for my wedding 10 years ago."}
{"text":"I understand that this is the place you take clients for business lunches to impress them and make them feel that you are slightly classier than them. And I think for that purpose this restaurant might be OK to a point. 

However this restaurant is \"classy\" in the Donald Trump way. This restaurant is more about the social games, and acting better than everyone else and less about the food. I noticed as soon as you walk in the wait staff are taking account of how much Gucci or Prada you are wearing. I also heard them mixing up other people's coats and simply explaining that it was a mix up, not apologizing. 

I didn't enjoy my visit here last week. The food was not that wonderful and the attitude of the service people detracted from my enjoyment of it. The view is nice, but it's not amazing. You don't have that great of a view unless you are sitting near the windows.  

I would take someone here for a business lunch here to impress them. I think the service people do put on a good show to make some diners feel that they are classy and at the top of the game, which can occasionally be useful. However as someone not entranced with the surface social games, I wouldn't go here for a romantic evening with a date or a relaxing family time where we feel taken care of."}
{"text":"A very special dining experience. The presentation is amazing, service is great and the food tastes almost as good as it looks. Only problem was that I mentioned in my reservation that the occasion was for a birthday which they totally ignored! I thought that wasn't really nice on their part but the wine helped me forget! It was a near perfect experience otherwise."}
{"text":"Took the hubs here for our anniversary and glad we came. Such a gorgeous view of the city while enjoying delicious creations. 

We asked for recommendations and they were all the same dishes we wanted to try. Everything was cooked perfectly and very creative compared to the usual preparations. Yeah, I'm talking about the S'mores Foie Gras and the Candied Salmon. Hubs loved the Wild Boar which was expertly seasoned and wasn't gamey. My fish had a good sear. Mushrooms...you have to get them.

Best meal of our trip. Canoe actually has a few other fine dining establishments beat in our book such as Jean George's in NYC, Guy Savoy in Vegas and Gary Danko in SF. Their price point is better, too."}
{"text":"The view is worth the money but not the food. Service was excellent but in general O&B restaurants quality are going down. Is the food worth my money? Nope. Is the view worth the money? Yes. Why people to here for dinner? Becuz of the name and the view but I can guarantee you what you are paying here you can get something a lot better with a cheaper price. Would I come back here again? Nope! Just better of going to CN Tower"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Loved the ambiance. Went there for Winterlicious and I absolutely loved the melt in your mouth rabbit and fowl pot pie.  The honey panna cotta was equally delicious! The next time I'm coming back here, I will definitely try to get a reservation near the windows. Even the view from where I was sitting (which was near the entrance) was beautiful."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I traveled to Toronto, from DC, for one of their birthdays.  We chose this restaurant, based on amazing reviews and surely, it didn't disappoint!  The staff were incredible professional and friendly and their wine knowledge was outstanding.  In addition, they took very special care of our girlfriend for her birthday.  Between this and the beautiful views of Toronto, it is one of our favorite go-to places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We came to Canoe to top off our trip to Canada. What a way to end!! We got the 7 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. Not cheap at $150 a head but to be honest every mouthful and sip was worth it. This was hands down one of the tastiest meals I have ever had. The wine pairings were excellent and our server Kevin was fantastic. This was an expensive evening but a very special one. Make sure to ask for a window seat when you reserve a table and take in the exquisite view of Toronto from the 54th floor of the TD building!"}
{"text":"This is one of those rare times when the taste and presentation of almost every single item we ordered far exceeded the already-fantastic description on the menu as well as our expectations.

Now, this was over a year ago, so I don't know if they still have this same dish, but the foie gras dish we had was paired with pumpkin-seed muffin (among other things). Best pairing I've tasted for foie gras to date, tied with the cotton candy foie gras at The Bazaar in Los Angeles.

From our waiter's suggestion, I went with the caribou. Great choice, as it turns out to be some of the most tender meat I've ever had.

Ohhh, and the bread. It came with a hummus and olive oil dip that my boyfriend just could not get enough of.

Maybe just we got really lucky with what we ordered... in which case, thank you waiter for the wonderful suggestions.

To top it all off, what a fantastic view!"}
{"text":"We visited canoe on a Tuesday night and ordered:

1. Cured hamachi
2. Venison tartare
3. Pork loin (seasonal menu)
4. Lamb

The bill amounted to roughly $160 with taxes, before tips. 

The dinning experience was very enjoyable overall, nice ambiance, attentive waiters, comfortable seating and great view. The food on the other hand was very averaged not quite worth the price paid. The venison tartare was unevenly mixed, resulting in bites that were salty and bites that were under seasoned. The tartare also lacked a hint of acidity (perhaps due to the uneven mixing that lead to all the pickles and capers being in the same bite). The cured fish was quite nice, but also a bit on the heavier side, could use a hint of acid as well.

I was really not impressed with the cook on the pork, it was slightly over (approaching well done) despite being a bone in chop which are supposed to be very juicy. The vegetables paired with (Chinese broccoli) didn't quite make sense to me. There two sauces from the dish also happened to be the same ones as the ones on the lamb dish... 

Overall, I've had much better food for such a high price tag and I don't really recommend canoe for a full priced dinner."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this restaurant after reading many reviews from other yelpers. I was a little underwhelmed by the service my family received. Our waiter awkwardly greeted us by coming to our table, looking at us and then after 20s said hi. I'm not sure if he was disappointed in seeing an oriental family because of stereotypes and thought we weren't going to order a lot or not tip him the standard? We had questions about the raw bar and he gave off the impression that we were just going to order 1 for six people, because he seemed surprised when we continued to order the entrees. Throughout the service our waiter did not seem to want to engage with us. 

The gentleman that came out with the raw bar blanked out a few times describing the different components to us. Even when you go to lower-scale restaurants they have everything practiced to perfection. The female waitress who offered us more bread seemed a little judgemental when we said yes, which made it uncomfortable. I'm not sure if they had bad experiences with oriental families in the past but I don't think we should've received a borderline discriminatory service because of that. 

Aside from the wait service, the hostesses, the atmosphere and food are top notch. It's a very spacious restaurant for the small space they have, and almost every table there has a view of the city at night. The raw bar is a MUST try! All the different items are incredibly tasty and fresh. The popcorn is also a great palette cleanser. As for entrees we ordered the duck breast, rib eye, lamb, salmon and were all very impressed with them. I do think my favourite item is their warm bread with chickpea spread though. The desserts are alright, order the panna cotta for a unique experience."}
{"text":"Amazing view.......it reminded me of the late windows on the world...
Yes, I understand it's only half of the height, but when it's this far up into the sky, the type of the view is pretty much the same. It's also aided by being so close to the CN tower. It looked as if you could just reach out and touch it.

Awesome food, the food was worth at least 4 star. I just had to bump it up to 5 stars for my overall experience.

So, let me start over from the top. After a week of incredibly tiring work I had to drive up to Toronto from NJ for my cousin's wedding. That's 1100+ miles of driving in 48 hour period. I was tired and in pain by the time I got to the restaurant. The open bar definitely helped in easing the pain, but seeing family and friends in one awesome room was a huge plus. 

Now I just need to take a vacation to recover from this trip......."}
{"text":"Been here 4x and food is always consistently top notch. Best view of the city, and service is 5 star. Lovely atmosphere, a bit corporate which is understandable. This is a tried'n true top restaurant for toronto. parking is validated after 5:30pm and make sure to park in 66 Wellington building- there are 2 TD towers which may confuse someone new to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and the food is sensational. On a clear day the view goes on forever, truly amazing. The menu is limited and the chef is outstanding, likely one of the best in all the Toronto. If you're coming here I assume you are already mentally prepared to spend about 100 per person. I went with my family and let me tell you, it was def out of my budget range. But the food, oh the food. Divine. From the salad to the risotto to the wine to the dessert, all of it was amazing. It is a place you should experience for a special occasion if your wallet allows. Why not 5 stars? I feel sad that so many will not be able to go because the prices are so high."}
{"text":"I travel to the Toronto area around once or twice a year, and this time I decided I wanted a bit of a splurge for dinner.  Having considered many other higher-end places, I I figure I can go to good French and Italian restaurants in the bay area, so decided on Canoe due to its \"Regional Canadian\" cuisine.  

My coworkers and I got in a bit early for our reservation, so we went to the bar area, which had a really good view of the city.  We had a bit of a wait and was seated after our reservation time, but the service once we were seated was very good.  We considered the tasting menu, but decided that we can get a bit more variety if we just ordered a la carte and tried each other's food.  

To start, we got the oysters, appetizer sampler, and sweetbreads.  The oysters were fresh and really good, as good I've gotten at other places, and the appetizer platter was also good.  However, the sweetbreads were fantastic!  For my entree, I got the suckling pig, which was good, though I was slightly disappointed that the 3 preparations did not include pork belly.  I had a small taste of my coworkers' entrees and the poultry dish (squab or quail?) was the best.

The highlight of the meal for me was the fabulous cheese platter...they have an all-Canadian cheese menu and I got 7 different cheeses!  My favorites were the unpasteurized goat's milk cheeses from Quebec, I guess the lack of pasteurization really does makes a difference.  Since these type of cheeses are illegal in the States I'm really glad to be able to try them.  The portions were plentiful, and they provided a lot of bread, nuts, fruit spread and honey to go with the cheeses, so I had enough leftover to eat the next day.  The cheeses were just so good that I didn't even want to try the desserts my coworkers ordered.

For wine, I had a glass of a Canadian rose bubbly at the bar, followed by a Canadian reisling for appetizers, Argentinian malbec for my entree, and Australian tawny port-style wine for dessert (good thing I wasn't driving!).  They were all decent and reasonably priced, and went well with the food.  The service was overall good and well-paced.

Sure, it was a bit pricey, but I thought this place was worth the experience (I would have paid for the cheese platter alone!)  I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a splurge meal in Toronto."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Lunch 2015.
 
Here's the long and short of it: Dessert, drinks, and a beautiful view redeemed the experience, somewhat. Otherwise, utterly forgettable (but prettily plated!) food - nothing outstanding for the perceived calibre of the restaurant.

Appetizers (decent)
Potage of Peaches & Cream Corn

{"text":"The deal here is the chef's table, and while that intimacy is going on: the awesome views compete in a sensory duel with what you're trying to eat.
They served up some dishes, doling out it,  some foie gras, some sweet lamb, some insanely melt in the corner of your mouth cheese from Québec that yet knew it could be cool at any border.

All of it: rife with life. 
Look at Michael U.'s review for a rational explanation."}
{"text":"Fabulous option for business travelers eating alone - had an appetizer and entree sitting at the bar.  The soup presentation and earthy mushroom flavors were a perfect antidote for the wintery weather.  The bartender's recommendations for wine pairings were spot on and the views of the night skyline added to the ambiance. Highly recommend this for foodies !"}
{"text":"On my latest trip to Toronto I was heading out in jeans and a sports jacket...went up to canoe for a drink and left.  Now I remember...if you're not in a suit, don't bother going!  I will stand by my review on the food, service, and atmosphere, as long as you are dressed up!  Very few no-tie's even.

3 stars this time only because I didn't feel welcome and left before a drink."}
{"text":"I finally went! Not sure why we hadn't been there before. I really loved it. The service is OUTSTANDING and what we ordered was great.  We didn't order hot dishes so I can't say if it's good, but the seafood platter was good. I ordered dessert and they decorated it very nicely for me since I was celebrating my bday. We're definitely going back. Can't wait to try their hot plates."}
{"text":"I have to say the best restaurant I have been to so far is Canoe and it continually has been so for the past few years. Canoe has great service, friendly staff and \"foodie goodness\" food. Haha. It is a place where you can pick anything off the menu, no matter what foreign names they use and still know the food will be good. With an exception to the watermelon soup - I am not a fan of that at all. 

I highly recommend it because the restaurant itself is very nice and provides a scenic view of the C.N. Tower and lake. It is a good place for dates, lunches/dinners with your boss or coworkers. To get the maximum experience, I suggest when making reservations to ask for a table next to the window, preferably facing either the C.N. Tower or lake. Optimum times to eat should be in the afternoon/evening, during the sunset."}
{"text":"Licking my fingers just reminiscing about the buttery Quebec foie gras that I just had for dinner at Canoe Summerlicious 2017. The yuzu, ginger crumble and stone fruit were the perfect accompaniment to this sublime and unique dish.

As always, Canoe Restaurant is top notch, fantastic and possibly one of the best restaurants in Canada.  It totally deserves all its critical acclaims and merits.

Canoe always has been my IT destination for licious despite the reservations are so hard to make (dialing 300 times or being on hold for one hour) but it was totally worth it in the end. I highly recommend to go there if you have never experience this excellent restaurant before.

The restaurant provides top notch professional service and high quality dishes  using  Canadian local ingredients. And don't forget the breathtaking and beautiful views of the city. 

Parking is validated in the evenings from 5:30 pm and during the day on the weekends.

I am very happy that City of Toronto and @liciousto for having Canoe as one of the participant for the yearly Winterlicious / Summerlicious programs where Torontonians can benefit prix a fixe three-courses lunch and/or dinner."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday and we were both blown away. The ambience, the staff, the view, and most of all the food lived up to our very high expectations. The pork was the best pork I have had in a very long time. My wife salmon was delicious. The bill can add up quickly but it is worth every penny. I highly recommend this restaurant if you need to impress your guests or treat your significant other to a great night."}
{"text":"Remarkable dining experience with a fantastic view! Had my first meal in Toronto here at Canoe and it sure left an unforgettable experience.
Their steak was tender, juicy and cooked just right; I can say the same thing for their venison as well!
The cream soup was also delicious!"}
{"text":"YAWWNNNNNN....
Restaurant and menu are so dated. Execution was poor. I've had comparable food on a cruise ship. That should tell you how lame this place is. 

Came here for valentine's day. I should've known that it would be a prix-fixe menu. It was fine but I was really looking forward to trying their foie gras, I had heard good things. Also, the hostess and the rest of the wait staff were friendly and down-to-earth.

Waiter took an exceptionally long time to bring our menus. After that took an even longer time to come and take our orders. He was apologetic and nice enough though. He did try to make amends by seeing if the kitchen would cook me some foie gras on the house (apparently they didn't have any in the kitchen that night) but it is unacceptable on Valentine's Day when you are paying so much.

The cocktail I ordered was delicious however. I can't remember what it was called unfortunately. 

Food was very slow to come out, presentation was cute, nothing spectacular, and nothing I haven't seen at restaurants that cost half as much. The menu was boring and seriously left something to be desired. The waiter accidentally brought me the same dish twice (not complaining, but simply commenting on the experience of the servers). 

Seriously though, the food was unimaginative, bland, and incredibly over-priced. 
Toronto has so many more interesting, creative establishments that you could frequent, unless that is, you have no taste and like to throw around wads of cash just to eat at one of the 'best' restaurants in the city. Honestly none of the things that I had experienced would have been an issue had the food been good, which it wasn't. 

Would I come back? No."}
{"text":"Due to the hype to one of the most sought out restaurants during these 'licious events, it has been a year or so before I was able to land myself a reservation. 

With a table of 8 during a Sunday lunch, we were seated by the window side. Woot! Though the weather was cloudy, it was a spectacular view of the city, especially by the Harbourfront. I can just imagine how it must look during sunset. 

Appetizers: 
Chilled Holland Marsh Leek & Potato Soup, marinated with chive oil and baby shellfish - This appetizer won me over right from the start. It was a cold preparation, with a smooth, creamy, and rich texture. The baby shellfood added a seafood element to it, which made it was one of the most delicious soups I've ever tried.

Wellington County Flatiron Steak - Beautifully presented. Medium rare, tender, and melts in your mouth. Definitely top notch.

Dessert:
Canoe Pecan Tart - Probably the most disappointing dish of the afternoon. It was served with a scoop of Vanilla icecream, but I couldn't distinguish the pecan tart from the ones I can buy at a store.

The waiter consistently made his presence known, but also knew when to come in at the right time when we needed something. 

Overall, fantastic service, beautiful ambience, top-of-the-line quality food. It definitely does live up to its hype. Will definitely be back for another 'licious round."}
{"text":"While the service was 5-Star and food 4-Star, the experience left much to the imagination. I think this place is more suitable for business affairs or men going with men to dinners, etc.

Not incredibly romantic atmosphere and the layout is too cafeteria-esque.

On the plus side, the Caribou from Yukon was out-of-this-world and the Sommelier was very helpful and fun to converse with.

I'd recommend this place for large parties or business meals. Nice wine list too. Pricey night out not worth it for an intimate affair."}
{"text":"Came here on a scattered storm night and bf was able to see the lightening with the most amazing view. 

The food and service was exceptional.
Had a reservation last minute and they were able to accommodate us even after we changed the timing twice.

Had the aged pork and was surprised with a side of blood pudding. I've always wanted to try it since Andrew Zimmern is my best friend (he just doesn't know it yet.) 
It was perfectly balanced with a hint of spice notes such as clove or cinnamon I believe. 
The pork was perfectly cooked. 
If I could eat the bone, I would.

Bf had the fish (forgot the name and type) and was extremely pleased. I took a nibble and it immediately melted in my mouth. 
We were both super pleased with our choices. 

Over all--
Modern, clean, great view, delicious food and lovely wine. What more could a girl ask for?"}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Toronto. The food, the atmosphere, the view, everything. There's nothing here that isn't near perfection."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Beautiful view from the 54th floor.  The food was very delicious. The seafood was very fresh. The meat very tender. Wonderful presentation. Professional and friendly service. Went there when it was very cold outside therefore, the option of parking underground of the building was a was a great advantage."}
{"text":"Among one of Canada's most sought after restaurants, Canoe is located in the heart of the financial district on the 54th floor.  Its reputation, location, view, and menu is the reason why so many flock to try Canoe.  At times you have to book well in advance, in my case with Winterlicious I'd booked a reso for 2 with myself and the bestie Ilona Ioanna G......2 Weeks ago!! 
Well worth the wait! the staff were extremely polite, and had sound knowledge of the menu, and its ingredients...which in my opion is KEY!!
For starters we both order french Chateau du Trignon Gigondas Rhone 2007 which was a light medium body which in tune, complimented our meal.
Our  appetizer was a 5/5 as their Pressed Maple Braised pork (like a pate) was deliciously prepared dressed with mustard, heirloom beans on the side, topped with puffed wlid rice!
The mains!! we both ordered their Ontario Strip Loin medium rare, but more on the rare side, served with short ribs and cheesy Alliston potatoes!! just delightful!!
In the end I ordered their three milk cake..aka Tres Leche! beautifully presented with caramel creme and vanilla mousse.
HOWEVER the special lady had a bland dessert, which I agreed.  Their Wild Rice pudding was bland, and the appricot didn't do justice to offset the blandness. however our waiter was able to compliment her with a lovely glass of dessert wine...compliments of the restaurant!! Going above and beyond the customer's need to set the expectations of this notable place was exhibited! Im impressed!! Probably the best O&B restaurant besides Auberge du Pommier."}
{"text":"Definitely make sure you have a reservation here in advance! Food, drink, and service is beyond great here. Ive been here many times! Most recently had the Qualicum Beach Scallops - which are to die for, and the Derby Manhattan cocktail is one hell of a cocktail - meaning amazeballz!"}
{"text":"Food is great, and presentation is wonderful. However, I felt a bit dissapointed with our waiter. He was distracted, busy and took an awful lot of time to even come get our order. Even then, didn't do much of a good job attending to us. 

Overall, a nice place, pricey, but good for occasions. The atmosphere is a bit \"stuffy\"."}
{"text":"went there with my mum yesterday for dinner,the lamb and berry tart is so good, starter is OK , overall a fancy place to go."}
{"text":"I was told to go here and expect an incredible view and very good food.  We ended up getting a pretty good view and incredible food.  Even though our seats weren't the best in the house, we immediately had the feeling we were at some place special from the moment we walked in.  A quick glance around at our fellow diners revealed very well dressed couples and various representatives of the wealthy and fabulous set.  The service was definitely top notch and the food was fantastic.  I would highly recommend it as a special occasion or as a treat for out of town guests."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, floor to ceiling views of Toronto, bartender advised that on a clear day you can actually see Niagara Falls from here.  I went for a cocktail reception and generally you would think the apps would be somewhat boring, untrue!!! The apps were sooo good, fall off the bone beef rib, Lobster in Mason jars, yum yum yum goes my tum just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Canoe was a good place to take your SO or your parents to dinner. In terms of quality and pricing, i was happy with the food and service and price. However, it would not be the best I've had in Toronto. The food was tasty, but I felt like they put a crumble on everything. 

We had the tasting menu and it came out in a timely order and the servers were very attentive to our needs. Unfortunately, for the price, i had to compare this on the level of other restaurants at this $, hence i docked off a bit for service.

Food: 5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Price point: 4/5

Overall, 4/5."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!!!! This is what fine dining should be. The food was creative and absolutely delicious, the restaurant ambiance is spot on and the servers are not pretentious. I will most definitely come back here. 

A note to Yelpers: you might run into some snobby/rude diners here as it's frequented by Toronto's rich scenesters... I had one drunk business man tell me (while I was exiting the restaurant) that he \"guesses my life has meaning as a physician, compared to him being an investment banker and having a Ferrari\".... Yes.... when you need someone to perform life saving emergency surgery on you, let's see if my life has meaning compared to yours!!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than Canoe. I've eaten here twice, and both meals were top-notch.  The stand-out for me was the beef. It was SO tender that I was able to cut it with a butter knife. I remember that everything else on the plate was delicious, too... but, the beef...the beef!!  I've also had the salmon, which was fantastic. I continue to be impressed with the care that goes into Canoe's food, both in taste and presentation. Be sure to try the butter tart for dessert. 

In addition to the great food, Canoe boasts one of the nicest bars in the city.  Grab a drink and enjoy the Toronto skyline (go in the evening to check out the sunset!)"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend, tonight, actually. Made a reservation about a week ago and it was already pretty full (considering its a Wednesday!). 
I had asked if we could get a table by the window and they were kind enough to set us up by the window. And I highly suggest asking for a window side table given that it has an amazing view of toronto (located at the 54th floor)!! 
As soon as we were seated we were approached by our very friendly waiter, and throughout the course of the night I think there were about 5 different wait staff who had served our table at some point. They were all very friendly and considerate. 
We ordered the venison tartare, the 7oz rib eye steak, and the lamb saddle. The tartare was, oh my god, delisioso! The portion was a little tiny (we shared between the two of us) but oh I wish there was more!!! To be honest I think the rib eye was better than the lamb, it was cooked to perfection and the sauces were amazing! The lamb was great too! Just not as good... if I had to choose one I would choose the rib eye the next time. 
Lastly we had the canoe butter tart. It wasn't crazy memorable but it was pretty good. I would want to try the other desserts on the menu next time! 
It's a great place for a date, a place to celebrate something, or just for an after work fancy meal. Make note that I said \"fancy\" because it is. And the bill will reflect that as well (Tartare, steak, lamb, dessert, and a bottle of wine approx $200+tx). But if you appreciate good food and service it's well worth the price."}
{"text":"Came here for my staff Xmas dinner. Was really looking forward to coming here and was disappointed witht the food. 

The place is a bit inconvenient to get to, the underground parking tries to trick and force u to do valet, even thought they offer validated parking. So be careful when entering. 

Service was great but expected for a high end restaurant like this. View was spectacular, but request a window seat. 

I'm not going to get into the food since I didn't find it oustanding for such a renowned place. I will posts my pics other than that I don't feel like wasting my time detailing the food, taste and description of it all"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for dinner last night. I don't usually go to places this expensive, I was really amazed. The food, the service, the attention to detail. I felt a bit outclassed when we first went in but everyone was so great I felt comfortable soon after. Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious $28 lunch. The food styling is out of this world! The salmon and the sheep milk curd taste odd but the Alberta Beef Brisket is WONDERFUL. Best beef I've ever had! It is so tender that your knife just glides right through and it melts in your mouth. It also tastes great, no wine taste or tomato or strong spice taste, everything just blends together. So sad it's not on the regular menu. Hope they'll bring this back! Would come back just for the beef if they have it!"}
{"text":"Canoe is a big...disappointment!
I've been there once and never want to come back, because the food just wasn't good at all. It's kind of surprising because I've heard a lot about this restaurant and was super exited to bring my mom here for her birthday. 
I ordered Caesar salad and risotto, my mom and my uncle both got steaks. The salad was okay, but risotto was blended and didn't have any flavour. My mom and my uncle both had complains about steaks, so they didn't finish them.
The only good thing was the view, but we couldn't see everything because of the fog."}
{"text":"Amazing Views at the top of TD tower. Modern take on Local Canadian cuisine, with an emphasis on locally foraged food. 

Saw a number of vegetarian dishes, but my hubby wanted to do the tasting menu. As most places do, the restaurant suggests all parties do the tasting menu (as to avoid one person eating while another watches etc), which could have been problematic, but the waiter actually talked to the chef and came out with vegetarian versions of everything on the tasting menu for me. It was pretty close so that when they brought out the soups they had to mark which one had the seafood with a small shell for the staff. The food was amazing

I got the accompanying wine tasting which was okay, as I prefer more full bodied reds and they featured local ontario wines (in line with the restaurants mission), the cocktails were fabulous. Service was great, and if you can get a table by the harbour/lake the view is amazing. 

As expected this restaurant is very hot, and very booked early out.  get a reservation as much in advance as possible"}
{"text":"nice scenery, great food."}
{"text":"I LOVE CANOE!
Went here last week for Winterlicious 2011 - worth every penny!
We sat at the Kitchen Rail and it is seriously, the best seat in the house.  You catch all the action in the kitchen, plus the views from out the windows, and you can even score a free appetizer on the house like we did when we were there (HAHAHA - ok, I can't guarantee everyone will score a free app, but we did).  Started out with a beautiful arugula salad, followed by the pate parfait deliciousness.  Then came our entree of the lamb ragu pasta which has big chunks of chestnuts and toasted croutons.  Dessert was this heavenly chocolate tart with caramel underneath - it was all just magnificent.  Service was top notch - completely down to earth.  Chef John runs the kitchen like a bad ass.  Mr. Oliver himself sat at the kitchen rail and had his meal 2 seats away - it was pretty darn cool.  Last thing I'll say about Canoe is that next time, I'm getting the lobster club.  That is clearly the #1 thing flying out of their non-Winterlicious menu and it looks amazing!  We'll be baaack!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here for summerlicious lunch after what I heard from friend, yelp, angels (not actually). This place is actually just as great, or even better than what they all say.

This place just pops when you first get to the top floor of the TD Tower, or maybe it's just still your eyes from the elevator that took you there. Either way, as soon as you step out the elevator; you can tell that the restaurant will meet and exceed your expectations. The hostess are extremely friendly and welcoming. As I got seated, someone came and placed the napkin on my lap for me. I mean who even does that?! I felt so pampered and it's not even been 5 minutes.

LUNCH:

My friends eventually came and for lunch I got:

1. Potted Rainbow Trout
Radishes, Tender Shoots & Pumpernickel 

Very unique. Loved it.

2. Canadian Bouillabaisse
Coast to Coast Seafood, Chimichurri & Profiteroles

It was basically clams.. honestly I wasn't too impressed. But don't worry, there's definitely a reason why I still put canoe as 5/5.

3. Sablé Breton (vegetarian/local)
Vanilla Roasted Plums & Caramelized Osprey Bluffs Honey

BEST. DESSERT. EVER. Although Canoe doesn't have the largest portion, i felt like this was just the perfect sized. The plums were sweet and was covered in a nice plum sauce as well. The bluff was perfect; kind of like a cheesecake, covered in pistachio cream. It was heavenly. 5/5 (but really 10/5).

Overall it was quite a nice experience. The view was stills spectacular even though it was raining outside. It looked like we were dining inside a cloud. I expected a little bit more though, a but more spark and magic from the restaurant. My friend highly suggested that dinner is much better and my boyfriend really wanted to come to Canoe so I snagged a reso the next night with him.


DINNER

My friend had also suggested to request a window seat for the reservation. As me and my boyfriend arrived at the restaurant, the hostess sat us in the smaller, more intimate room right by the window. It was the corner too so it was quite enough for us to have a conversation; probably the best seat in my opinion (:D). 

I can't even begin with the view, it was around 8:30pm with no cloud in the cloud, but a pink background with an almost-full moon. The view was like from a movie. The only thing that was terrible was that I forgot my phone to take pictures... But it was the first time my boyfriend didn't feel embarrassed that I used his phone to take pictures.

1. Arnold Tipsy (13). ;Dillon's Gin, Limoncella ; Lime & Pink Jasmine Iced Tea

Gotta say, this actually did get me tipsy. Even before our appetizers came. It hits you when you drink it, but it's nice, summery, and refreshing. 

2. Aurora Chicken Terrine (local); Holland Marsh Leeks, Scrunchions & Wild Gribiche

The chicken was soft with bits of herb inside. It was so beautifully plated with small bits of veggies on the plate. I'm not too much a fan of pickled vegetables which seems to be what I've been getting at a lot of the summerlicious meals. But at Canoe I would eat it over and over again. 

3. Bison Bavette & Short Rib (local); Heirloom Tomato, Watercress & Crushed Alliston Potatoes

This dish. Oh. My. This. Thing. I can't. Just get it. Meat. Gah. Mmmm. The meat just falls off the bone. The sauce. Dat sauce.

4. Sablé Breton (vegetarian/local); Vanilla Roasted Plums, Pistachio Mousseline & Caramelized Osprey Bluffs Honey

Yeah I got this for dessert. Again. Like I said, it was heavenly. It wasn't even because I didn't want to try the other desserts (my friends at lunch got the other two), but I just had to taste this one again. it was plated a bi differently, but still magnificent. The taste was of course, magnificent as well, or more because of the beautiful view... or the alcohol. 

All in all, my summerlicious experience at Canoe was one of the best experiences I've had at any restaurant. Everything was perfect at the right moment and the dishes were inexplicably amazing. Of course it's pricey, but I'm already excited for my next trip here whenever that might be."}
{"text":"A dream of a restaurant I wish we could frequent.  Lovely views, attentive service, creative plates which are full of flavour."}

My bf ordered:
Pickled Atlantic Mackerel
Cider Brined Ontario Pork Loin
Hewitt's Dairy Muscovado Panna Cotta

My order:
Baby Gem Salad
Braised Alberta Lamb Shoulder
Kernal's PB+J

I'm not a fan of mackerel so I didn't try it. The pork was super soft but it has a strong pork taste which I'm not a fan of (personal preference). The Panna cotta was delicious, rich and creamy. 

Salad, nothing special besides colourful presentation. The tiger blue cheese was pungently awesome. The Russian dressing tastes like wasabi. 

I LOVE the braised lamb shoulder dish! It was so soft and juicy and delicious. The lamb shoulder melted in my mouth. I could eat that everyday. Everything on the dish was perfect and each ingredient complimented each other. 

The kernels pbj was good too. The mousse was soft and light which I liked. My tongue was tango'ing with my dessert.

Overall I am very impressed with Canoe despite being super duper busy during this time of the year. I would love to try other dishes but I'm pretty sure they're fully booked :/

Oh and who said fine dining will leave you hungry still? I wasn't hungry until around 10pm."}
{"text":"Canoe is an amazing dining experience, easily five stars on an absolute scale.  But, Canoe is also about as expensive as it gets - the tasting menu with wine is $150, and my friends and I spent about $200 each total, so relative to other restaurants in that price range, I have to bump it down to four stars.  

View was beautiful, ambiance was very nice (classy, a bit romantic).  Service was impeccable, albeit a bit pretentious.  Our server was nice enough to offer us a personal tour of the kitchen, which was a unique experience.

Be sure to make reservations and explicitly request a table by the window.

I didn't enjoy the Beef Tartar, but that's not to say it wasn't well done.  I personally found it to have too much pickled taste and too much horseradish.  

For mains, we shared an \"oatmeal\" venison and dry-aged ribeye; both cuts of meat were good, but not what I expected, but the 'dressing' and presentation was spectacular.  

Dessert was the best part!  The sticky toffee date pudding was truly spectacular, easily five stars, and the only t hing our stubborn waiter would actually recommend.    We also had the strawberry pave with almond foam (it's in this season, it seems) which was very light and a perfect way to end the night.

Ate with @Jess C. so check out her review as well.  She's a bit harder to please than I am tho.  I'd definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Updating my past review for Canoe - I still give it 5 stars!
Service was excellent. Our waiter was very friendly and courteous.

Drinks:
White wine pairing (Forgot the name.. haha)

Appetizers:
S'MORES FOIE GRAS
(graham cracker crumble, chocolate sauce and toasted marshmallow cream)
So far I still think Canoe makes one of the best foie gras dishes in Toronto. I've tried other ways of making the foie gras dishes at Canoe before and it never disappoints! Always very delicious.

Mains:
WAGYU TRI-TIP
(smoked tongue, king oyster mushrooms, purple potato + bacon chive jus)
Highly recommending this! So glad they didn't take this off the menu - out of all the dishes I've tried so far, the wagyu beef is the most tender and delicious one :)

ONTARIO LAMB DUO 
(roasted loin + olive anchovy rubbed lamb ham, rosemary artichokes, fresh shelled beans)
Such a cute display. The lamb was very tender (each meat was a different part of the lamb).
The veggies paired with it were also delish!

GRASS RUBBED BISON RIB EYE
(green tomato, horseradish greens, pickled cauliflower, tonka bean + k2 Milling grain pakoras)
The meats were amazing - but I didn't really like the pickled cauliflower. A little too sour for my taste. Other than that, everything about this dish was wonderful.

Dessert:
CLASSIC CANOE BUTTER TART
(smoked vanilla cream, flax seed nougatine, rye + ginger ice cream)
We were actually trying to order the dessert that we got last time but chose the wrong one haha. BUT! It was a good \"mistake\" because this was DELICIOUS!! So yummy!! 
I loved it - especially the ginger ice cream!! It was a lovely combo with the flax seed nougatine (if only they had more of this! :D)"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner and we did the 'Taste Maritimes' tasting menu. Overall, the atmosphere, the service, and the plating contributed to a phenomenal experience, but the food left something to be desired.

To drink, I had the Dill Pickle martini. Overall a very good drink; a bit sweeter than I expected, and you can taste the dill in the aftertaste. 

The tasting menu consisted of 7 courses with two options to choose from for the main.

1. Kiss the Cod: 
An amuse-bouche consisting of deep-fried cod-tongue served with a carrot purée. Overall, a cute dish, tasty but nothing memorable.

2. Jiggs Dinner Terrine:
 I really did not enjoy this dish. It was a corned beef terrine garnished with mashed peas, carrots, a sort of sweet jelly, and a slice of what seemed to be biscotti. Plating was beautiful but the flavours to me did not work at all.

3. Clam Bake: 
Again, beautifully presented dish. A mix of razor clams, mussels, seaweed, and a sort of foam presented on a bed of shells. The server than came and poured some sort of hot broth into the heated dish and made steam go up. Presentation was great, but the taste was nothing unique.

4. Cloudberry
A palate cleanser before the main course. It was something like a sour pear gelatin. 

5. Hodgepodge
The main dish. Consisted of a piece of cod and lobster tail with a cream sauce and vegetables. The cod and the lobster were very well cooked, and the dish was pleasant overall.

6. Baba au Screech
Definitely the highlight of the meal. This dessert consisted of lemon sabayon, poppy seed cream, fennel pollen meringue, and two sponge cakes. All the flavours worked perfectly; the dots of cream varied from tart, to creamy, to sugary. Great dessert.

7. Chocolate Potato Chip
I wouldn't really count this as much of a course, but to finish the meal, they gave us each a chocolate covered potato chip to finish the meal. It was good, but left my stomach feeling kind of greasy.

Overall, it was a great experience. The food didn't blow my mind, but the atmosphere, pace of the dinner, and the service made up for it. We got to see the sun set, and there was plenty of time for conversation between courses. Would definitely recommend just for the experience.

3/5 for the food
5/5 for the atmosphere"}
{"text":"We went to Canoe for dinner at the end of the last December. 
View from the restaurant was just gorgeous.  Our waiter was a great server.   We just liked whatever and whenever he did for us.  Food presentation was wonderful.   All food  and drinks that we had were more than our expectation.   Definitely, we would like to go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Amazing and completely 10/10, every time we have been here. Some luxurious places do not always hit that 10/10 point, but if you want a guaranteed perfect setting for an evening out, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"There's no question that this place has an absolutely spectacular view.  It's a perfect spot for a date, or a special dinner with friends or family.  

The service is incredibly friendly and professional.  They really know how to treat you well.  One of my friend's meals came right when he left to have a cigarette.  Originally they put a top on it to keep it warm, but since it took awhile, they brought it back to the kitchen and made him a new plate on a rush basis.  It was completely unnecessary but so kind of them to over that.

They have an incredible list of wines that pair well with the food.  The waiters/waitresses are well educated on which wines go well with what dishes.  The food is also incredible.  The presentation, the flavour combinations, the textures...all delicious.  A great place for upscale Canadian food."}
{"text":"delish. lunch reservations for summerlicious. seated right on time, great view of the CN tower from our table and great view of the kitchen from our table as well. The kitchen was fully staffed and clean looking, very cool concept of open kitchen, they're so clean they have nothing to hide. We got our water, drinks and orders in perfect time. The waiter was a very courteous french-english girl. She described our dishes to us before we ate them and everything was sooo delicious! All the food came out on time and in perfect temperature. I had the Capon and it was mouth watering. The dessert was a chocolate fudge cake with caramel sauce... sooo good they put gold flakes on the chocolate. Go here, its expensive but at least you're getting what you paid for... every penny!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious with few friends. We had 11:30am reservation and were the first to arrive. They had big glass windows and beautiful view of the city. After taking a few pictures, we settled down on our tables and soon the place was packed with customers. Surprisingly most of them seemed to be Asians.

Had the fole grais parfait for appetizer l, braised lamb shoulder for main and berry crumble for dessert. The parfait was nice. The lamb shoulder soft and tender. Perfectly cooked and did not have a strong gamey flavor. The berry crumble was good as well with lots of content."}
{"text":"Amazing place, top notch food, great view. One of the best restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious.  Was another great experience.  I got the smoke salmon salad as appetizer and it's so far the best dish I have had this summerlicious.  The salmon was soft and tasted good.  The veggies and sauces added many different flavours to the dish and went well with the salmon. 
For main I got the tuna dish. Overall I thought the dish was average.  The tuna was more over cooked than I would like.  Also it had a strong fishy taste too it. The other components to the dish was good but nothing stood out.
For dessert I got the berry crumble.  I liked the crumbles and there was a good amount of berries.  Didn't like the liquid was in the bottom of the jar. After mixing the liquid with the crumble the dish started looking unappetizing."}
{"text":"I have to say Canoe lives up to its expectation. I had been saving this restaurant for a special occasion, but at the same time anxious around the hype and expectations as a top restaurant in Toronto. My first advice is to request a table by the window. As one would expect, service is impeccable and the wine selection very good. We skipped the starters and instead ordered three main courses for two people. My favourite main was the tea smoked duck breast. We also ordered the pacific halibut and the tamarack lamb, which were both delicious. We were so full, but had to try at least one dessert. Canoe's most famous dessert is the hazelnut chocolate torte, but we opted for the rhubarb cheesecake at the recommendation of our server. It was good, but the cheesecake was covered with a layer of white chocolate which is too sweet for my taste. For those seeking an insider experience, Canoe has a few \"bar seats\" with a view into their kitchen. 

Tip: For an experience that won't hurt the wallet, you can also stop in for a drink at the bar - same awesome view of the city!"}
{"text":"Went there for a cocktail and spectacular view with my friend. Amazing! Will definitely book a table for dinner there to try the food next time."}
{"text":"Amazing and possibly by new fav restaurant in Toronto.  Killer views and exquisite food and service.  Modern, clean, and delicious.  The highlight was the reserved maple syrup tasting!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was average. Presentation average. View is amazing of downtown Toronto, but the overall eating experience is average at best.

Not worth it for the price! (fortunately I didn't have to pick up the tab while I was there!!)"}
{"text":"First we were given table away from the Window but my girlfriend asked for one and we got it.  Amazing views. Night is better since you don't get to see the dirt and grit of Toronto. 

Food here is to die for.  Everyone should eat here at least once, so they can put the food in other Toronto restaurants in perspective.  Local, farm-fresh ingredients - you can taste the freshness in the mouth.  

If Canada had Michelin-starred restaurants - this one would be so."}
{"text":"I don't really see what the hype is all about. I recently had dinner here for a special occasion and have been super let down. The service and the environment at Canoe was superb, but other than that there is nothing really special about it. With the overpriced food, that comes in rabbit portions. Unless you feel like coming for a $60 piece of prime rib the size of a Babybel... It's just funny as I have never been to a restaurant that will break the bank and leave you hungry."}
{"text":"Their food may be good, but their technology is completely busted.

Cannot purchase a gift certificate online.  Too many errors/problems to list.  Calling them for help was useless.

Contact Us form on their website is also broken.

No way to email them."}
{"text":"This is strictly a review of their winterlicious menu. 

First off, I want to point out that the service was spectacular and that we had the most amazing view of the CN Tower--It really made the lunch something special! However, I do admit that the food left something to be desired. Nothing was inedible, but nothing was especially great either... It was decent meal, but nothing to remember--at least food wise. I had the pleasure of tasting everything on the winterlicious menu, so here is my take on all of it:

APPS

Lentil soup: great! Warm and comforting. The turkey was a nice touch. Personally my favourite starter, but a soup is a soup is a soup--if you know what I mean. (3.5/5)

Baby Gem Salad: Fresh, tasty dressing, the purple potato chips were fun. Nothing too special. One salad came with a strand of hair in it though, oopsies. (3.5/5)

Pig Cretons: the crouton like bread thing that came with it was fabulous, everything else was eghhh (3/5)

Mackerel: tasted like it literally came out of a tin. (1/5)

MAINS

Lamb: horrid; I'm not much of a lamb person though (N/A)

Pork: well cooked but terribly seasoned. The only redeeming aspect of this dish would be those delicious mustard greens (2.5/5)

Croquette: like canned fish fluffed up, deep fried, and put on a fancy plate (1/5)

Campanelle: HALLELUJAH! Delicious delicious delicious-- the pasta was fantastic, but again, was it because all the other dishes were mediocre? (4/5)

DESSERTS

PB&J: super decadent, reminds me of a chocolate bar (3/5)

Panna Cotta: quite good, the Panna cotta was great but I could have done without all the mess around it (3.5/5)

Pumpkin cake: like every other pumpkin tasting thing imaginable (2.5/5) 


They gave us bread and hummus to start, and I also ordered their pineapple mint juice which was alright. The wine pairing was 32 dollars extra, but if you got the pork, they gave you cider to go with the main--which was not great, to be honest. We were informed that we could switch it out before hand for a nice glass of wine and we should have. 

Although the meal was meh, I do want to return on a non-winterlicious day to get a sense of what the restaurant is like without all the hoopla. Give it a go if you have the money, it's really a bargain for a three course meal."}
{"text":"Gotta go there for the tasting menu with wine pairing. 7 course meal and incredible wine pairing. The food is to die for. Staff is very polite and attentioned to details. Pricy (with tip for one it cost me $220), but eh, we only have one life to live! Plus the view from the 54th floor..! Must try."}
{"text":"We decided to visit Canoe at the last minute, so with no reservation, we had dinner at the bar, but what a treat!
Located on the 54th floor of the TD Bank Tower, the view is amazing.  The restaurant is very stylish and our waitress was simply perfect, offering recommendations when asked and even answering a few questions we had about the city, since we were visiting.  
Everything we ate was delicious.  We shared the Beef Tongue Poutine (with tiny pieces of beef tongue, perfect to add depth to the dish), The Chicken Confit Drumettes (that melted in your mouth) and the Classic Canoe Mini Tourtières (the perfect balance of sweet and salty).  The Chocolate and Squash Dessert was as yummy as it was beautiful.
In the end, we were glad to be seated at the bar since we were facing the Ontario Lake, and it was quite an amazing view while enjoying  superb food."}
{"text":"Canoe is in a class of its own in the Toronto culinary world, and the reasons are apparent the moment you walk through the door and into the warm, open, subdued, chic \"modernized woodland\" space.

Owing to its name and its pervasive \"Canadiana\" motif, it'd be easy for the décor to veer towards some kind of twee Pierre Berton homage, but it's sufficiently restrained to balance bright playfulness with elegant maturity.  (Incidentally, the same is true of the food!)  Our table had a spectacular view of the city, particularly from my date's side of the table.

We opted for the \"Taste Maple\" tasting menu and were almost uniformly impressed.

The \"duo of sockeye salmon and maple cured salmon tartare\" was an elaborate montage incorporating a delicious lively radish purée and little bits of pickled sea asparagus.

The \"tree syrup glazed frog legs\" were not such a hit.  Surprisingly, they were fried in a thick, floury batter à la General Tzo's Chicken, and painted with an equally thick glaze.  The frying process cooked the delicate meat to the texture of overdone chicken.  The glaze was intensely sweet with no discernible maple flavour.  Consequently, the legs tasted neither of frog nor of tree.  The parsley root purée, though, was divine -- I could have eaten a bowl of it all by itself.

Both the mains -- maple & miso glazed b.c. sablefish // pork with maple casoulet beans -- were excellent.

The dessert, a cornmeal cake with maple syrup and an oatmeal icecream with the most interesting texture -- recognizably ice cream-y yet ever so slightly gritty and floury, sort of like a pulverized oatmeal scone -- was just fantastic.

Service was impeccable and friendly.

Although it's not yet in quite the same league as places like Gary Danko, it deserves its exceptional status in Toronto, and I would certainly go again, particularly for their next inventive tasting menu.  I hope Canoe stands as an example of what it's possible for a restaurant to accomplish in Toronto, and as proof that there's a burgeoning market for \"food as art\" in this city."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great ambiance and stunning view!

My boyfriend heard many great reviews from his colleagues and had decided to bring me to Canoe for dinner to celebrate our anniversary. The interior of the restaurant looked very modern and upscale, with large windows showing Toronto's city lights. Our waiter was very attentive and informative, describing the menu items in great detail. The appetizers and main dishes we ordered were beautifully presented and tasted very delicious. And to top it all off, our waiter brought us a pretty plate of small desserts wishing us a Happy Anniversary which was very nice. 

We had a lovely experience at Canoe, from the beautiful night view to the exquisite food. Canoe is definitely a great place to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and other special events."}
{"text":"Excellent service (Radek is the best), spectacular view, and great food. This restaurant is great for special occasions or important business luncheons. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came to Canoe yesterday for Summerlicious.  It was really crowded and noisy during our dinner.  Overall, the food was great but I felt that our dinner was a bit rushed.  I don't blame Canoe because they were probably trying to get rid of us to get the next dinner crowd going (and obviously cash in as much as they can during summerlicious).  Our Server did not take the time to go over the meal and I think it would have been nice if they did.  Either way, I kind of didn't expect a restaurant like this to treat their summerlicious clientele the same as their regular clientele (non-summerlicious folks) LOL."}
{"text":"Super fancy restaurant, with the price tag to go with it, and a spectacular view of Toronto. This place is filled with business dinners and couples celebrating a special occasion, and then there was me with my coworker trying to use our per diem to cover half of what this meal would cost.

They have a tasting menu for $100 per person, but you only get 3-4 courses, which is not that great of a deal; I've eaten at restaurants in the Bay Area that are Michelin starred for just about that, but with more food. I suppose you're paying for the magnificent view and ambiance.

My coworker and decided to get 2 appetizers, an entree each, and dessert. I think this was the better way to go, since the 2 appetizers that we got to pick off the menu were the highlights of the meal and you'd be amiss to not get these. They started us off with 2 different types of warm bread, and a chickpea spread that was really good.

Beef Tenderloin Tartare ($24) - One of the best beef tartares that I've had - it was fresh, well seasoned and the pretzel toast (like a very thin bagel chip) was good. There were only 3 pieces of this pretzel toast, so make sure to ration it properly. Pricey, but worth it if you're here. I would get this again.

Pan Seared Quebec Fois Gras ($28) - This is the best foie gras I've ever had -- not that I'm an expert in foie gras, but this was delicious. Don't think about what it is, or how bad it is for you and just get this dish - it's amazing. My coworker and I were both raving about it. Great flavor, and a great pairing with the fruit, peanut sauce & roasted peanuts. Expensive, but I'd get this again and recommend it to everyone.

Walleye ($38) - The fish was just good, it almost tasted like a fancier fish and chips - the outside was crispy, and it was sitting in some tartar sauce with little pieces of potato gnocchi. Don't get me wrong, it was good - but not mind-blowing, especially at that price.

Flourless Chocolate Cake ($12) - If you love chocolate (like I do), you'll love this dessert. It had a praline mousse about the width of a poker chip, and some weird praline bread that was tasteless. The chocolate cake was dense and rich, and paired well with the sauces drizzled on a plate, and hazelnuts.

The meal was about $120 per person (my co-worker got two drinks and I got one drink), so it was pretty expensive. I thought the best things were definitely the beef tartare, foie gras, and the view. Not sure if I would come back here again or recommend it unless you were on an expense budget or you were taking a client out. I think there are better places to eat in Toronto for less, but this is certainly an experience or good for a special occasion.

They will validate your parking in the lot right next door to the restaurant - FYI!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed for my summerlicious lunch reservation on Monday.  The male server was not friendly at all.  When I sat down, I waited a long time before I got his attention.  I told him that I was in a rush because of lunch hour and asked if I can get everything fast.  The first course, salmon tartare tasted good.  The second course, east + west coast fish cake was blend and tasteless.  I only finish a quarter of it and was already 45 mins into my lunch with no server attention.  After I waited and waited, I asked my server whether I can pack everything to go including my dessert.  Then, he made a comment saying that if I only knew you have 20 mins, I will.........come on, I told you I was in a rush when I sat down.  I waited for another 15 mins and the restaurant manager came and said they ran out of take out boxes.  My server didn't even say sorry or apologize.  When I ask for the bill, not even a thank you :( If they want to run this restaurant as high end, they really need to train their staff properly and teach them what customer service is all about.  Dislike!"}
{"text":"(First time dining in T.O., so I'm shaving a star off for sake of the competition I haven't met yet. I'm also not a hardcore foodie, so I'm going to skip the 6 paragraphs about how this food may or may not have asserted my place in the universe.)

Appetizer was the northern woods mushroom soup, the main was the Ontario beef tenderloin w/ side of pan roasted northern woods mushrooms, and some gin cured duck breast I nicked off my wife's plate, because, hey, family style or get out.
Desert was the classic canoe butter tart, and premium Canadian cheese for social nibbling.

In short- had a great time; Excellent service, succulent food (two of the party had a great chuckle at the show put on for the Fogo crab and the P.E.I. Cow's cheese, as they both lived minutes away from both), and a fantastic view."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.. the atmosphere is incredible. You sit 40 stories up in what feels to be a mash up of modern and rustic design.  The kitchen is open to view so you can see all of the chefs diligently making their next meal. The menu is eclectic but everything I tried was incredible.. if your in Toronto you must try this restaurant or you'll be missing out."}
{"text":"Apparently it's hard to get a reservation at this restaurant during Summerlicious. But a friend of mine and I called on the day of and took a cancelled reservation (lucky us!)

So this restaurant, perched on top of the TD building, has spectacular view of the city. Just as well, their lunch menu is quiet the steal--$25--compared to their usual prices. 

The ambiance is a fine dining experience, but the waitstaff/ servers are very polite and tried to make conversations with their clients. This is not a snooty place. 

Food-wise- i ordered chilled cucumber soup, pasta on chicken broth and for dessert i got hazelnut chocolate cake (Divine!). I tasted the steak as well...and I'd have to say..the steak was the BEST steak I've ever had. Maybe I never order steak enough..but it was by far the best I've tasted in Toronto. 

So if you want good service, good food, beautiful city views..go to Canoe :)"}
{"text":"By far one of the nest summerlicious deals... normally this place costs $100+ per person, and during summerlicious you pay less than half of that. In addition, the views are awesome and food is super tasty. The summerlicious portions are very generous, I got short ribs and it was so big I felt like Fred Flinstone eating this big piece of meat! I recommend going for the $45 dinner because you get your $30 parking reimbursed! Whereas if you go during the day (weekday) you pay $30, plus $28 per person for lunch... so might as well do the dinner or go on a weekend. I'm sure by now all the summerliciouses are probably booked, but be early for winterlicious!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited for our 7 year anniversary and we had an amazing time. We were going to get oysters when our waiter recommended the mini raw bar which wasn't on the menu. It was literally AMAZING! I would come here just to have a drink and share the mini raw bar. It consisted of oysters, some lobster, tuna salad, shrimp, scallops and POPCORN. We also had the duck breast and the venison as our mains. To be honest they were great but the raw bar really took the cake. For the price comparison I would choose the raw bar. Lastly, our waiter was really friendly, made amazing recommendations and made some great conversation at the end. Overall, a great night and place."}
{"text":"I love Canoe. It's perfect for a special occasion or a date. 

Food is great, high quality but simple and classic dishes. We had the foie gras and oysters as appetizers, lamb, halibut and salmon as mains and the date crumble and chocolate + kernel peanut as desert. all VERY highly recommended. 

Service is great, our waiter was friendly and made some great recommendations.

The view is my favourite thing about Canoe, try to come around sunset - it's beautiful. 

All in all, if you want to treat someone, take them to Canoe."}
{"text":"Good attention to reservations.Wonderful table with a view( perfect) Madding somewhat older crowd;consistent neither the tab.Staff balancing frantic with friendly.

Expensive. Billed for the tough lamb.Noisy.
Night out for the folks.
       Not again"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and the view is great. You can see a bunch of Toronto & Lake Ontario. The service from my waiter & sommelier were wonderful. I went with the tasting menu with wine and I'm glad I did. Everything was perfect! The bison two says & the tartar \"sandwich\" with onion broth are still on my mind. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone going to Toronto. I also learned a little about Canadian wines!"}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant with outstanding views of downtown Toronto and the CN tower.  Service was impeccable and the food was spectacular.  I had made a reservation 2 months in advance and they were able to accommodate my requests.  I definitely would come back to Canoe for another great experience.  The wagyu beef was tender and delicious.  The cocktails were great, the spicy peach was delicious."}
{"text":"We came here in March and didn't get to see the great view everyone's talking about because it was dark and rainy. I was sort of turned off by the ambience. My boyfriend and I came by ourselves and were seated very closely to another group of people. It seems only the bigger tables get any kind of privacy. It was kind of loud.

We both got the tasting menu with wine pairing. The food was really great and fresh. Maybe if this was my first \"fine dining\" experience, I would've been blown away. But the service was so mediocre. We were waiting around quite a bit and the servers didn't really seem to care.

The overall experience wasn't terrible but I wasn't really blown away either. I just expected more from \"one of the best restaurants in Toronto.\""}
{"text":"If you want an AMAZING meal with an AMAZING view, this is your place! Impeccable service, fabulous presentation and a wonderful desert to cap it off. It is pricey but with every penny!  I had the rib eye steak and the butter tart for desert."}
{"text":"One of the finest dining experiences I've ever had. Everything was flavorful, and those flavors were memorable. Plus, the view of the city and the lake is a fantastic setting, and the service was excellent. Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Canoe is a great place for their atmosphere being on the top of the TD tower with a 180 view of the downtown Toronto.  I came here for summerlicious dinner.  The first course was the Ontario Bufala Mozzarella.  This dish lack a bit of seasoning and tasted rather blend as mozzarella doesn't normally have any flavour on its own.  The crab topped on the mozzarella was very sweet and fresh and the walnut were toasted nicely with great crunch.  This dish lack the acid require to make the overall pop in your mouth.  The next course I had is Alberta Beef Strip Loin.  This dish portion is great with two giant pieces of strip loin topped off with braise short rib which added more flavour to the dish.  The potato is by far the best on this dish.  It's nice and crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  The last dish was Valrhona Chocolate Ganache Cake.  This dessert is very rich.  It tasted more like truffle than a ganache.  The dark chocolate is very overpowering.  I would have love it if there was a hint of sweetness to balance the richness in the chocolate.  Overall this was an average meal which for this price point during summerlicious is fair."}
{"text":"This review is very long overdue. I had come here for a friends birthday, making this my second visit here.

The venue itself is just awesome. When you get off the elevator and first go to your seat you can't help but be in awe of the view of Toronto. I highly suggest coming here in the evening as on a clear night, all the lights of Toronto dance in the night.

You can easily spend a lot of time here just chit chatting and enjoying the food and the view.

At no point in time did I ever feel \"rushed\". It's hard to describe, but some restaurants you sorta get that feeling that they want you out. Like when they keep on hovering around your table and after every sip of water they refill it. Or every two minutes they come to ask you if everything is ok. 

I dont deny that the meal here is on the pricier side but there are a few things to keep in mind. The cost also includes the view, service and the food which is always consistently good. What sets this place apart is the service never seems to fail me.

There are some newer \"trendy\" restaurants, that are also on the pricier side but totally can fail you on service. With canoe, if there are any misgivings whatsoever I dont hesitate to politely bring it up, and I trust that everything is then made right. 

There's a reason canoe has been around this long, because they really do know the word \"consistency\". Coming in here you know your getting what you pay for. The newer restaurants are trying to go on bulk, and sadly can be a bit hit and miss. Not with canoe though.

If you want a fancy date night, I would definitely recommend you consider Canoe. Any place where people can get married in has to have good quality right? Yup, a lot of people have weddings here!"}
{"text":"The cleanest meal with the best view during our 4-day trip, so we're happy we ended our visit here, glad to fork over $140 CAD even with their credit card reader snafu. It was Summerlicious and the nice staff handled people in shorts well. They were unfortunately slow to take orders and get bread, and despite the # of reviews and their high rating, the name is not search-friendly."}
{"text":"Ok, guys.....
This is my 1st review and I'm not really a good writer so please be easy on me. ^^

I was be able to get the chance to make a reservation for their Winterlicious 2014.

Me and my GF had high hope since we read all the good reviews from various sources.


We had following dishes - 

App : 1. Cured trout - it as not too salty at all and trout and other ingredients/sauce
all mixed beautifully... My GF was very satisfied.Creme Fraiche eased strong flavor of picked veg and the fish and created a good harmony.

2. Pressed Pork - I really loved the richness of pressed pork and wild 
mustard was a great choice to go with it..the only disappointment was wild rice.... since it's been puffed in a way like rice crispy and lost it's own scent and 
flavor.... I was expecting it to taste stronger. ^^

Main : We both chose sirloin dish.

Me - Blue ( love juice so much and did not want to loose any!) GF - Med-rare ( we had to return this to cook more because for my GF, it was a bt undercooked but they replaced the dish without any hesitation. )

Gherkin Sour cream.... never tasted it so wondered how good it will be....
the result? - it was superb~!!!! My blue was juicy and full of flavor!!!!!
I was smiling all the time!!! little side of Braised ribs ( although it could not contain it's original form) added little twist and again, mixed with juice and sour cream, it helped to create layers of different taste on each bite!  - it was interesting to feel how the taste changed when I try different ratio of those 3 components.

Dessert -  This is where I had to drop may be 0.5 stars ..... 

I had  3 milk cake and GF had Carrot cake. My cake was rich and flavorful.... but little dry.....I was expecting to taste more moist in them.........

GF's Carrot cake...... it was her birthday so they decorated the plate with cute message and a candle.. but it was also dry......she told me the taste is amazing but as she chew more..only the dryness remains... May be they were outside for a long time?

each dish came with candid walnut and peanuts on the side - Again, tasted great but because cakes were dry...........It did not mixed well as a whole dish.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Will i go there again? Defiantly... Was it worth the money we paid? Of course. Will I recommend this restaurant to friends and others? YES!

In overall, we had great time and each dishes were unique and tasty.
Desert was not up to what we expected but we did not order a la cart.
As a Winterlicious restaurant, Canoe did better than few other places
which we been through and it's location - top of the TD tower - with beautiful view outside really satisfied both of us.

(Don't know how to include pics so I just attached them at the photo section.
 Please see them before you make any  judgement! ^^)"}
{"text":"Great view of CN tower and Lake Ontario.
I sat in the bar area facing the windows. 
Had the seared foie so amaze and the \"risotto\", which was made with an orzo so a tad surprised. 
Service was fab. 
Would def love to come back. Reso is def needed for dining area and specify view seating."}
{"text":"Really great food with an awesome view. 

I had the cured arctic char to start, followed by the BC skate and octopus. 

The cured char was amazing. I had never had ikura roe before, and it is fantastic. Salty, sweet, and light. The entire dish was balanced and fun to eat. Sometimes I would taste on thing at a time, other times I would blend the flavors together. It was tasty no matter what.

The BC skate and octopus was great as well. This was my first time eating skate, and I was surprised at the mild taste and flaky texture. I eat octopus often, and this was a great dish for it. It was great to have it served without a ton of paprika or red wine taste. Definitely a dish for those that love octopus.

The service was great as well. Exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Also, if you sit towards the back of the dining room you get a view of both the lakefront and the open kitchen."}
{"text":"As a food-loving, enthusiastic tourist, I love places like Canoe. The menu highlights local ingredients, the view is phenomenal, and the service is wonderfully friendly and attentive. Although the price is a bit high for the quality of the food, the overall quality of the experience more than justified the cost. 

The service is top notch. I ended up dining alone, as an hour's worth of fog in Philadelphia had managed to snarl air traffic on the eastern seaboard for days - stranding my intended dining companion outside of Canada. Alas. Everyone I encountered, from the hostess to the bussers to my waiter, was incredibly friendly and attentive. My waiter, hearing that I was visiting Toronto for the first time, even gave me a crash course in Canadian geography - using the stunning view as a visual aide. Bonus!

The food was very good - classic offerings, but often with a local twist. I started my meal with one of the day's specials, a lobster bisque. It had a very different flavor from a standard lobster bisque - almost pumpkin-y. It was definitely seasonal! There was a generous portion of lovely, sweet lobster meat. For my entree I had the beef brisket, which was very tender and had excellent flavor. The serving size was very generous. My waiter suggested that I try the rolled butter tart for dessert, describing it as something that \"every Canadian kid eats.\" It was lovely! A little messy to eat (I really should have ditched the fork and picked it up with my hands), but delicious. I am jealous of these Canadian kids. 

In addition to the service, the real standout at Canoe is the ambiance. The restaurant is located on the 54th floor of the TD building and has great views of the city of Toronto and Lake Ontario. For someone visiting from out of town, this is a definite highlight (honestly I thought the view was better than that from the CN Tower!). If you're a native to Toronto, I imagine you'd only come here for something you could put on an expense account - I was surrounded by very professional-looking people in very nice suits, so my guess is that this is where they get most of their business. But if you're in Toronto for a visit, a lunch at Canoe and a chance to eat while overlooking the city would definitely not go amiss!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place for years and finally tried it for an anniversary dinner.  Not horrible but really just Meh.  Nothing stood out from the service to the food.  Nice view...but that's about it."}
{"text":"Very good food. Phenomenal Service. Phenomenal location at the top of the tower. 

However the campfire egg and the flour-less chocolate cake made this worth remembering. Two of the better dishes of my life."}
{"text":"We went to canoe for dinner.  Good food and service. Ambiance was nice. I would suggest going earlier in the day so you can enjoy the view and sunshine, but the nighttime view is nice as well. Expected a bit more flavour in the food as well as more variety. Dessert was great."}
{"text":"Just okay...very pricey and showy but felt the food could have been better.

I think it's more of a tourist destination so people go for the view."}
{"text":"I do not even know what to say. Yes. This was the most expensive dinner I have had in years. Dinner for two was $350.00 with tax and tip, modest bottles of wine and one dessert. 

That being said, it was an outstanding dining experience and worth the price of admission. My only complaint about the restaurant is the noise level. Canoe is very loud. My wife and I split the Canoe plate as a first course. The Foie Gras was good, and easily the least successful part of our dinner. The Lobster Salad, Salmon Tartare and Filet were beyond reproach.

My Caribou saddle was easily the richest, most tender steak I have ever eaten, my wife's Lamb loin was quite flavorful in a way that cuts of Lamb in restaurants often are not.

The fig and date pudding, which we ordered on the advice of our terrific server in lieu of cheese (which he also loved) was an outstanding dessert. 

I was wowed by the quality of Canadian wines we had with our meal. 

Truly an experience to remember."}
{"text":"Canoe is another Toronto favorite and definitely one of the top restaurants in the city. 

I've come here for a date, a business dinner and with my family - it is that versatile. You can always rely on the service, food and the incredible view of the Toronto skyline / waterfront. 

TIP: If you're on a more casual date, grab seats at the kitchen and watch the chefs prepare the food - amazing experience.

FOOD:
- The raw bar is sublime and a specialty of the restaurant. If you can handle it, eat this.
- ** the menu changes but there is usually a foie gras option and you should have it **
- Have something truly Canadian as a main: Venison or Sturgeon for instance. There is usually something with maple also - do that!
- Have a sweet Canadian wine with dessert (Inniskilin is a personal favorite) - and opt for one sweet and one cheese platter. You won't be disappointed.

WINE: No words needed; this is one of the best wine lists around and you'll find what you want. Sommelier is also always helpful with choices and I'd leverage him/her if needed."}
{"text":"Private dining with a smaller group.  Service was excellent.  Servers efficient friendly and helpful.  Attentive without being overbearing - a very fine balance that they accomplished.

The meal was a tasting menu with wine pairings, with appetizers before hand.

Chef explained each course personally and his understated enthusiasm is infectious.  We were each looking to taste the highlights he spoke of - outstanding.  Unknown fish and spicy prawn dish were favourites! 

Sommelier was friendly and knew her stuff explaining each wine, why it worked with the food and had a clear enjoyment of her profession.

Thanks to both for the extra suggestion on wine pairing Turkey and the extracurricular lesson on the art of French fries!"}
{"text":"1 star for each dollar sign + 1 star for putting us as high up as the CN tower!  

My cousin had her wedding here and it was truly fabulous fancy experience!  You know the food is unique, when the table was mesmerized by the SALAD.  Wellington beef was delish.  Try their trademark pink lychee drink (u can ask them to spike it for u!) which all the relatives (even the aunties) loved.    

May have been all the romance in the air, the breathtaking view...spending 7 hours up in Canoe, the world looked so much more beautiful than when we had to finally come down to Earth (sappy, I know!)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once for summerlicious and once another time. The staff was really friendly. For summerlicious, we requested window seating when making reservations and a few people entered our space to take photos of the view but our waiter compensated us with free caramel lattes and free scones. Also, he gave us an extra appetizer for free because ours was a relatively smaller portion. Out of both times I've been here, I would highly recommend the calf liver (not on the summerlicious menu) and I would also recommend the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. I've tried 4 different desserts here and this sticky toffee pudding puts Moxie's, Bella Notte and any other sticky toffee pudding to shame. Best dessert!"}
{"text":"My partner was sick after eating oysters here.  I enjoyed some dishes, but the soup was blah.  I've had better fois gras, but it was OK.  The steak was again, just OK, but not filled with the scrumptiousness one would expect.  The duck was nice - they managed to get it right and filter the 'gameyness' that duck can often possess. For spending as much as we did (4 bills), we expected not more, but a lot better.  There seems to be a 'hype' for these places that don't often live up to their self-proclaimed reputations and this restaurant is no different.  Would I go back? Maybe for a drink or two and to enjoy the decent view, but not for a meal.  We called the restaurant to tell them about our negative experience with the oysters - they were less than apologetic and the lady who I spoke to said all it takes is one.  True, but I didn't expect that one to be sitting on a plate that costed what it did.  That's fine.  I'll just tell others about the experience, over and over."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.

Generally places that are expensive are at a distinct disadvantage because your expectations are so overinflated (in both extremes) based on the high emotional investment that people place on their experiences there.   There's also generally a great deal of buzz surrounding these restaurants from foodies and social climbers.

Canoe's no exception.    

I arrived not knowing really what to make of the place.   Half my friends telling me that it was \"a once in a lifetime place\" and that I'd love it while the other half say that it \"wasn't that good\" or \"not worth it\".   Strong and polarized viewpoints to say the least.

So, I decided to do a weekday lunch there.   The crowd alone was worth the price of admission.   It was like a Harry Rosen store where all the mannequins were animatronic.   Very much a boys club... but sprinkled with a few beautiful women along the way.

The service was absolutely outstanding.  Top notch all along.   Friendly and prompt without seeming in-your-face or annoying.

The food.  In the end, I was pleasantly surprised.    The steak tartare appetizer was particularly stellar.   Presentation and flavor was tops.  

Definitely worth a drop in."}
{"text":"Yes its beautiful, the menu reads beautifully, the wine list leans heavily upon local (great if you like) but the service lacks the polish and finesse one would expect at this price point.  We enjoyed the prix fix  tasting menu without the local wine paring and opted instead for a mid priced bottle of Bordeaux (celebrating an anniversary.) 

The servers could use a little culinary 101, which is easily applied if and when the management sees the necessity (like now perhaps.) 

 I enjoyed the number of tall toques bobbing around the kitchen upon the heads of the line cooks... maybe it's my San Francisco food snobbery shining through but a bit more attention upon the food would be better served for all .  Looking for advise? Save the dough and go have a cocktail in the bar area with high backed chairs while enjoying the magnificent view-"}
{"text":"I went to Canoe for Summerlicious last year, it's expensive, so this is probably the cheapest way to go for the experience. Food was decent, portions were better than I expected. Friendly service, and great view. I originally thought it'd be a bit of a stuck up place, but it felt more like a cafe, which at least I found comfortable. However, I went in the day time, so maybe the night experience is a little different.

Considering how many tall buildings there are in Toronto, it's surprising there are not more of these types of restaurants."}
{"text":"I loved, loved, loved this place!

I went last night because it was my birthday. Not to sound like a broken record, but it is on the 54th floor of TD Tower. This means that the decor of the place is obvi beautiful and the clientele is composed of business people. You get a nice view of Toronto from the window. Reservations can be made on the Internet, which makes things more convenient. I had a reservation for 7 PM and requested a window seat. Both my reservation and request were carried out. I found the service to be excellent and the food was great!

Come here for a special event... and don't forget to ask for window seat.

{"text":"This was my first time to try their summerlicious lunch. It was $28 for the 3-course lunch which included appetizer, main course and dessert. I selected fole gras parfait, braised lamb shoulder and mint chocolate torte as my three courses. I didn't like the fole gras parfait at all so that I asked the waiter to see whether he could change to rainbow trout for me. The waiter agreed so quickly and he wanted me to have an excellent experience in Canoe! The braised lamb shoulder was really soft and easy to chew. The sauce was fit with the lamb which made it taste perfectly. The mint chocolate torte was made of rich dark chocolate. It was perfect when eating the chocolate with the mint cream. 

The view was amazing where you can see CN Tower, Harbourfront and Ontario Lake. The environment of the restaurant was so high class. The service was very good. But the food portion was too tiny! If you more focus on the food, I will recommend you go to try other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Went for 2017 Summerlicious.  This is our 4th outings during the last seven days for this year Summerlicious.  
Overall I would rate food at 4 of 5.  Clean and refined tasting, good presentation, nice portions. Menu selections were also good. 
However, service from our server was at bare minimum and average. 
Didn't ask me if we wanted cocktails, wines or even coffee!
So I also intentionally forego all of the above...so save me a few $$!
That is just fine with me because I already have a great wine collection and 2 nespresso machines at home.
My other observation is the serving and greeting staff has a bias to seat Asians away from the preferred window seating areas and to offer the bare minimum level of service. 
I traveled extensively in North America and at times to Asia and Europe and has an expense account so I wont make an effort to return or recommend Canoe to my clients or colleagues. The competition is fierce so let it be."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to Canoe for a very long time, and finally got a chance to go for lunch this week. I was very excited to try their Summerlicious menu. My review is based on the three dishes I tried, which are as follows: 
Chicken terrine: 
A cold pallid rectangular cube of an grayish item was served, which looked like pate to me(I enjoy pate), but as I broke into it, it tasted and looked like processed canned meat, like spam. (Small disappointment) 
Pasta with summer legumes:
The nice and professional server brings over a bowl of white pasta, with steamed lima beans and perhaps four snow peas, and that's it !. The pasta perhaps had drops sunflower oil as seasoning. This dish was extremely bland and I cannot fathom how and why this made it to the summerlicious menu. (Biggest disappointment)
Dessert: 
The food till this point was so disappointing that I didn't expect much from the dessert. The bad food parade continued with the dessert because my vanilla pudding, which had a fancy name, seemed to have too much vanilla extract in it because it tasted slightly bitter. 

The restaurant does have a good view, and very professional service, but the dishes that I tried for Summerlicious 2014 were all utterly bland and thought less. The bison that I my co workers had looked good, but in my opinion if you par take in summerlicious then every dish should be delightful. This experience replaces Canoe as a small  wedding reception contender from my books.

I initially gave this place a star, but because of the service and the view, the service, and the complimentary bread and tasty hummus I will bump it up to a two star!"}
{"text":"I love Canoe, mainly for the view, but also the food is incredible and the service is down to earth and personable. You are really made to feel special when you go to this restaurant. The venue is incredible. The wine pairings are always top notch too. It's a great experience!"}
{"text":"If you're ballin' on a budget, this is not the place to be!  If you really want to go, better come with a GENEROUS friend with a six-figure salary otherwise it could be an awkward moment when the bill comes!  

They have an extensive wine selection from different areas (ie. Napa, Ontario, France, Italy, etc.).  Surprisingly we got a really good Chardonnay from the Ontario area, recommended by the sommelier, AND it was reasonably priced.  

Canoe has a breathtaking view of Toronto because its nestled atop the TD Bank Tower.  As expected, service was top notch and the food lived up to the hype.  We ordered several dishes and shared it family style.  Everything we had was magnificent but the dish that stuck out the most was the Steak Tartar and Foie Gras!   You MUST order this!  

Definitely wouldn't mind coming back for dinner to see the view of Toronto at night!  

Money well spent!"}
{"text":"I love going to canoe because of the quality of food and service they offer. Today was no different. I came here for their Winterlicious lunch with four friends. Initially there was only four of us but we had a last minute addition and they were accommodating. 

For starters I had the Maple Mustard Pork Rillette (local) Kozlik's Mustard, Hen's Egg & Gherkin. I've been having rillettes everywhere this Winterlicious (smoked salmon, duck). So far this one edged out all the others. The hens egg was a REALLY nice touch!!

For the main I had the Ontario Strip Loin with Northern Woods Mushrooms, Layered Potato & Birch Onion Marmalade. Although it was nicely cooked I wasn't a big fan of the strip loin. But everything else was exceptional. The mushrooms were amazing! I need to learn how to make the onion marmalade because it was so damn good. Everything together was like a symphony. 

For dessert I had the Heirloom Carrot Cake (vegetarian) with Cream Cheese Mousse & Red Bean Orange Sauce. The carrot cake was soft and moist. Just the way I like it. I couldn't get enough of the cream cheese mousse. The red bean orange sauce felt like it was overpowered by everything else which was unexpected since I thought it would be the most intense flavor on the plate. Overall the plate was really good and not too sweet. 

I also had the wine tasting and our server was more than glad to make substitutions. The timing was impeccable. As soon as we finished one course the next course arrived within minutes. Although it's quite hard to get reservations around this time I HIGHLY recommend going here."}
{"text":"We went there for Summerlisous  dinner. Everything was perfect. The view, the dishes served the service and the wine paring.  The had wine paring selected from Canadian wines. I don't know much about Canadian wines but those selected were great and matched perfectly with the dishes"}
{"text":"I had a lovely birthday dinner at Canoe. My boyfriend had mentioned it was my birthday when making the reservation and we had a fantastic table looking our over the lake. The servers and the manager all said happy birthday to me, which was also a nice touch. I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant - upscale but very comfortable, and fairly quiet so good for conversation. I felt more relaxed as soon as I sat down. 

The food ranged from good to amazing. The salad we had to start (green bean with pea shoots and watercress) was one of the best salads I've had in a restaurant. The combination of ingredients and flavours was very unique, and it was perfectly dressed. We also shared the smoked arctic char which I thought was just okay (not a ton of flavour, and a tiny portion). Our mains were excellent - I had pickerel and my boyfriend had pork. My dish had a large piece of fish and the sides were well-chosen, made for a good combination of flavours and textures. We also shared a side of broccoli rabe and japanese asparagus which was decent. For dessert we shared the butter tart which was delicious (and happy birthday was written on the plate in chocolate, another nice touch). 

Overall, we had a great meal and good service. I'm leaving off a star only because at the price point of the restaurant, I was hoping to be blown away by every dish which wasn't quite the case. Regardless, I would definitely recommend Canoe for a special occasion and would love to go back some day!"}
{"text":"Great view! Canoe is on the 54th floor in the TD Tower, and  It made our already delicious food even better.

The menu is really interesting, and is executed very well. I forgot what I had, it was a fish I had never had before, and it was great. The rice and brussel sprouts were tasty too.

For dessert, we had a salted chocolate concoction filled with a caramel sauce that was to die for. 

The drink list is good, and the wines we had were delicious. The service was really great - nice, professional, courteous, friendly - just really good. 

When dinner was over, our server, who knew we were from the US, offered us \"ice wine,\" which he said is a local after dinner custom. I'm all for trying to live like the locals, so I had a glass. Whoa, holy sweetness! Apparently, ice wine is made by freezing the grapes on the vines, and then crushing them into wine. Something to do with the sugars and frozen water end up making the wine very, very sweet. So, when in Ontario, try the ice wine. I won't be ordering it again any time soon, but I appreciate that  learned something about you, Ontario."}
{"text":"Normally when they tell you its a restaurant \"with a view\" from a high floor of a building that is code for saying the restaurant only exists because of the view. This is NOT the case with Canoe.

Not only is Canoe a beautiful space with a fantastic bar scene on a high floor but more importantly the food is fantastic.  My wife and I went there because of the Yelp ratings and being lovers of fine dining were hoping for the best and Canoe really delivered.

Canoe uses phenomenal meats and produce, if you can get the caribou get it. The cheeses the desserts and the wine pairings they suggest make it great but also approachable. The wait staff that we had were so helpful and our questions and interest in the food was appreciated by the chef who came out to talk to us.

We loved Canoe and will be back when we have a chance to return to Toronto."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a great place to be- the ambiance was great, waitstaff very knowledgeable, and the food fantastic.  I would go back just for the view though - what a great compliment to such a special place."}
{"text":"I came with 2 other friends and had a really great time. I think the most impressive part of the whole experience was the service and the artistic plating. Also, finding many unique ingredients that you rarely see gathered on one plate. In general, the lighting is dim but the atmosphere is lively, even late at night, probably because of Winterlicious.  

Among the 3 of us, we tried almost all of the items in the Winterlicious menu. Among the ones we tried, the salt cod and crab rillettes for starter, the tenderloin for main, and sticky toffee pudding for dessert were the best. The others were delicious as well but these just suited my taste buds the most. I also tried the spiced ice which was an iced tea with a slight kick. All 3 of us were suckers for fresh warm bread, and the servers kept us happy by bringing more baskets and indulged our request for balsamic vinegar along with their spread.

This place is very fancy and great for that special occasion you'd want to remember for a long time."}
{"text":"Note that I didn't actually eat at Canoe but this is my experience making a reservation for Winterlicious 2018. 

Canoe may be the one restaurant that I constantly get raving recommendations on their exquisite food, but unfortunately my first encounter with them was extremely unpleasant. I called to make a reservation, and was content if I couldn't get a table because I know how popular Canoe is. However the receptionist on the phone was either unprofessional, unhelpful, or hates her job. It was like pulling teeth when I tried to get information from her, and she did not sounded like she cared or tried to offer any solutions to solve a problem. 

I also didn't get a reservation at another Winterlicious restaurant, but the receptionist there was welcoming, made sure I was informed, and tried to provide a solution to my problem. 

It seems like people that visit Canoe during their usual occasions receive great services, and not so much when it comes to Winterlicious/Summerlicious. If that is the case, Canoe, you would be much better off not participating in these events and save the time of your customers from going through these horrible experiences. 

If my first encounter with a restaurant already leaves such a bad taste afterwards, I am very reserved on whether I would be visiting this place at all, regardless of how exquisite their food is."}
{"text":"The service was incredible, the hostess and waiter were so welcoming and kind. Besides that the view is breathtaking! I'd love to have dinner here during sunset or in the evening it must be even nicer then.

Now, onto the food! I came during winterlicious for lunch.

For appetizers I tried the foie gras parfait. It was hands down the highlight of the meal for me. It was wonderfully rich and silky, the mouth feel was just dreamy. The sweet and tart jam and the salty buttery pastry along with the grapes offered wonderful contrast from the foie gras.

The fogo island cod rilette was interesting. It's a very tart, tangy dish. The plating is striking. The fish is very soft and topped with pickles and cauliflower. The pickles are very sour. It's quite refreshing.

For the main course I tried the salmon and the beef.

The beef is amazing. It was melt in your mouth tender and just dreamy to eat.  The plating was beautiful with the bright orange puree and vegetables contrasting from the dark shiny beef.

The salmon was interesting.  It was a tad dry when I got it but the skin was delightfully crispy. The contrast between the lentils, fish and skin was quite nice.

Dessert was wonderful. The flourless chocolate cake is incredible rich and silky. It's delicious! The yogurt verine is lovely as well. The yogurt is silky and has a rich mouth feel. And the tangy sea buck thorn berries offer a lovely tangy burst of sunny flavour that contrasts nicely with the mild and creamy yogurt.

Overall I'd recommend the restaurant to a friend and definitely want to go back. The plating here is definitely among the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful, that I've seen."}
{"text":"I received a gift certificate for the Oliver & Bonacini sister restaurants and thought that it was a good excuse to try Canoe.  We went here with my friend for her birthday on a weeknight and not during a 'licious event.  We came early and chilled at the bar as we waited for our tables.  I mentioned that it was her birthday when I made the reservations and they made a good effort to say 'happy birthday' several times during our visit.

We enjoyed the blood orange and passion fruit & lychee fruit juices, because for some reason we were avoiding alcohol that night.  The bar was impressive and fully stocked.  The view was stunning, I would say arguably on par with CN Tower 360 since you get to actually see the CN Tower, which is the most beautiful building in the Toronto skyline IMO.

The restaurant is small, and full on a weekday surprisingly.  We opt for the tasting menu and were not impressed with the food.  I was expecting mediocre food based on prior reviews, but I would say that it doesn't even meet the mediocre standards.  We started with a small butternut squash, maple cream soup.  Then it went downhill.  We had a pork, foraged pickles and bacon jam.  It was disappointing, even the bacon jam couldn't save the dish.  I like how the restaurant tries to offer local options, but was not impressed with the spock or the elk dish that we ordered.  It just didn't come together very well.  Also, all of the dishes were served very slowly - apps and dinner felt like it took 2 hours.  I did not like the spacing of the meal.  We started to get really tired and eventually decided to pack the dessert to-go.

If I get another gift certificate, I'd go to Oliver & Bonacini or Bannock."}

Thankful went for lunch only!

{"text":"Do you like to cut your steak with a butter knife and have it melt in your mouth? I sure do. And that is exactly what you will get here if you order your steak medium rare. Hmm, so full of flavour, so amazing. The memory makes it hard for me to concentrate on writing the rest of this review, but here I go.

The others I dined with had other delicious looking and smelling meals. I barely noticed because I was so absorbed with own. A general silence feel over our table when everything arrived because of the presentation and aroma, and it continued as everyone enjoyed their food.

Before and after the meal, we were also impressed with the view of the city. I recommend going in the evening when the city is lit up. Very pretty.

What added the little extra to make this place a 5++ stars, was the service. They were there when needed, and unnoticeable when they weren't.

The whole experience was memorable and worthy of repeating...many many times."}
{"text":"Pretty much paying for the beautiful view of Lake Ontario, not the quality of the food. Atmosphere and environment of the restaurant is gorgeous and service is amazing. Great spot to try out at least once or on special occasions."}
{"text":"I came as a guest for a corporate event on a Tuesday evening - we were in a private room which faced south and looked out to the lake. Unfortunately it was a bit off to the East side so we were not able to get a clear view of the CN Tower - great view regardless.

The evening started with drinks (wine, cocktails, and even beer - essentially anything from the menu) - we were served the Biff's wines, which were not bad, but not impressionable either. This was followed by a dinner (3-course meal with choices for each), where Cavespring wines were served (orders from the drinks menus were also taken).

For the appetizer - I had a spinach and quinoa salad (quite refreshing and just enough dressing - I just wished they had mentioned it would be served with a sort of goat cheese/cream). I went for the baseball cut strip loin (medium rare_ for my main and thought it was done well (though I may have gotten lucky - a friend also ordered this but had a bit too much fat on it than desired). There were lots of positive reviews for the stuffed cornish hen, which was stuffed with foie gras and grains. Finally, I chose the Canoe classic butter tart for dessert on the wait staff's recommendation, not much to note here.

The service was good - I would say less impressive than that at Auberge du Pommier (but there may be a difference between dining with a small group vs. a big corporate event).

All in all, I had a good time at this restaurant - similar to my views for Auberge du Pommier (another O&B spot), I would say the selling points are the ambiance and service. Would be best to come here for summerlicious or winterlicious."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Canoe, absolutely love this place. The atmosphere and the staff are phenomenal. I cannot get enough Of the view of Toronto. 
High quality food, amaizing dessert!"}
{"text":"Canoe is a \"top table\" literally, not just figuratively; on the 54th floor overlooking Lake Ontario, it doesn't get much better. 

And Canoe doesn't rest on its laurels - it's always working to stay \"on top\", and it shows. The cuisine is \"new Canadian\" and takes pains to use so, so many local ingredients. As a visitor, I'm looking for these exact things when dining out: locality, authenticity, and great tasting food, and Canoe never disappoints.  Even if you have dinner plans elsewhere, I'd recommend stopping in for a reasonably-priced cocktail ($12 for a Moscow mule, and a huge selection of manhattans starting around $13) with one of the best views of toronto. 

The critics love Canoe, and I do too."}
{"text":"Canoe is pretty much everything I expected it to be. Yummy food, good service, great view and a perfect place to go on a special occasion or to treat yourself to something nice. If you can go at lunch time the prices are a bit cheaper, and the menu is also completely different. The only downside is that they are usually only open Monday-Friday.

If you are worried about Canoe being a place with small over priced portions and you'll walk away feeling hungry do not despair, as this is a place where the bread keeps coming. I think our table of 2 went through 4 baskets of complimentary bread with black bean spread. The artisanal bread was fabulous. Crunchy on the outside, and soft in the middle.

My girlfriend and I both had the beef short ribs with whipped potatoes, sauteed kale, sugar beets, and pickled sour cream. The beef was very tender and falling off the bone. The flavours were wonderful. The dish seemed to have little yellow beets on top of the short rib, with a couple large red ones on the side. My only complaint is I could have used more whipped potatoes, but then the dish wouldn't have looked as nice. In the end, I have no regrets ordering the short rib.

For dessert we both had the red velvet cake, with sweetened cream cheese, smoked marshmallow ice cream, and salted chocolate ganache. The smoked marshmallow ice cream is definitely what caught my eye and made me order it, but the element that brings it all together is the salted chocolate ganache. It makes sure everything isn't just sweet on sweet, and overall the dessert wasn't too sweet to begin with. It was also a very pretty plate, and a decent sized serving for a dessert at a \"fancy restaurant\". The dessert was definitely worth ordering.

If you are coming from out of town, and want to save a few bucks on the CN tower, the view from Canoe is just as good, and they have a bar area you can sit at and grab a drink or something to eat while you're there."}
{"text":"Based on Summerlicious, I found my new special occasion spot. Beautifully decorated with a huge sitting space and an amazing view of Toronto, this place serves contemporary food.
However, service could be better. 

They start with bread and hummus (they called roasted chickpea something), and they will refill it if you ask for.  Drinks selection was pretty good, particularly cocktails.

Funnel Pickled salad to start with, was a perfect combination of fresh crisp veggies, sweet and sourness. For mains I ordered Risoni Risotto, they were delicious, perfectly cooked. For desserts, I and my hubby shared a Summer berry crumble & Flourless chocolate cake, both were delicious with generous portions. The ambience is really romantic and the view from 54th floor is gorgeous.

My husband ordered Foie Gras Parfait for starters, Ontario braised lamb shoulder for mains. He loved both of them, mains, in particular, the juicy tender lamb with distinctive flavours, well cooked.

The only thing we were not impressed was, service, proper attention was not paid to us, we had to call our server many times for water or cutlery, we would have preferred a little more interactive server.

But Yeah, I am visiting them again, may be we get a better server this time.

We parked at 145 king, a reasonable parking nearby."}
{"text":"Sitting on the 54th floor of the TD building, this place is a definite go-to for its view. During the day, you'll have a nice view of all the buildings and the lake, as well as the boats out in the lake. At night, you'll have a nice view of all the buildings, the lights, and the CN tower lit up. I've been here for dinner and for a private event, with the service being great both times.
 
Of course, the taste and the presentation of their food are both great. For dinner, I had their Summerlicious menu and even though the serving sizes seemed small, it was really filling. For the private event, the servers walked around offering bite-sized foods to us--mini burgers, samosas, etc, and even those were cooked to perfection and still nice and hot when they served it to us.
 
So overall, there's really nothing to complain about this place, except that the prices are on the expensive side. It's a great place to go for business lunches/dinners or just to get a few drinks after work."}
{"text":"I have only visited this premium restaurant during summerlicious and winterlicious.  Canoe is apparently the \"best\" restaurant in Toronto.  Although best depends on your taste buds.   The decor and the windows looking out onto the CN tower and lake ontario is amazing.  It is definitely a date spot made to impress the ladies.   

This is Canadian fine dining.   The food is prepared and looks like art.  The service is amazing even for those of us on a summerlicious/winterlicious cheap menu.   Although I personally wouldn't come here on a regular menu, it's dooable on special licious events.   The best deal is a licious lunch menu which will run you at around $55."}
{"text":"With my crazy schedule for TIFF (30 films in 6 days), I didn't have much time to explore the Toronto food scene, but I did have one evening where I had time to go a little farther away from the theater and actually sit down and eat at a semi-leisurely pace. However, with two whole hours to kill, four days into my schedule, I was also tempted to just go back to my room and take a nap... I'm so glad I didn't! Everything about Canoe was amazing!

Service: I sat at the bar since I was dining alone, and didn't want to take up a table by myself during a peak season. The bartenders were both friendly, offered great suggestions, and were attentive despite the nearly full bar area.

Beverages: Wine selection was excellent with a large selection of California wines, but since I was in Canada, I decided to try a canadian wine. The tawse growers blend pinot noir was delicious.

Food: I was torn between the duck and the mackerel and lobster with corn grits from their specialty seasonal corn menu. I asked the bartender for her favorite and while the duck is one of her favorites, the specialty menu is only offered for a limited time and is where the chef really shines. I went with the mackerel and lobster and was not disappointed. For dessert I tried the Butter Tart Wedge. I was about torn between the Butter Tart and the Red Velvet Cake, but as the bartender pointed out, the Butter Tart Wedge is a traditional canadian dessert and much lighter than the you-can-have-variations-of-it-anywhere cake and I still had two films to see later that evening. So the wedge was a good choice for not falling asleep during a screening. And the wedge was so good! 

View (from the 54th floor on a clear day at sunset): priceless.

I left feeling full but not stuffed and was able to run off to my next screening. If I go to TIFF again, this will definitely become my must-visit restaurant."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the hype that killed reality. I had high expectations for this restaurant but the food and presentation honeatly did not live up to it. 
Went there for dinner and the main course (duck breast) was decent but I have definitely had better, more flavourful and tender duck breast in the past. The dessert just tasted awful...
Some good things about Canoe, the environment and service was top notch. Definitely a good first date restaurant, but not a foody restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for their summerlicious menu. The food is great but could be amazing or bigger portion for that price. My picky cousin, who went to some Michelin starred restaurants, claims that food is 6-7/10. The service is great, servers were friendly and always know which order is yours, the knife that I accidentally drop was picked up in a minute. It's a great place to come with a family to celebrate something. However, portions could be bigger or the food could taste amazing."}
{"text":"this was my first meal in TO, courtesy of my fiancee, and it was indeed memorable. rarely does a restaurant with an incredible view have unforgettable food-- Canoe does both. i can still taste the soy glazed cod (i think); the root vegetables and rich broths were all from local ingredients, which was a epicurean welcome to Canada! this is an excellent place for a business lunch or a place to take visitors with refined palates."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our 4th wedding anniversary. I've been to high end restaurants before but she hadn't so I wasn't quite sure how this was going to go.
My family has a lot of dietary restrictions and I was in constant contact prior to our reservation to find out what our options were. We ended up opting for the tasting menu which was a great choice on our part and we were ever so grateful that Canoe was able to contour to our dietary needs.

Route to the Rockies

Okroshka

I was taken aback by this dish. I wasn't too sure how to eat it. The wait staff were really knowledgeable and were more than happy to indulge our questions about the food and how it is supposed to be envisioned. After a quick discussion we decided just to dive in and we found that all the components worked best together. The seasoning wasn't over powering and I didn't find myself disliking anything that was put forward on the dish. I cleared the entire plate.

Rye Whiskey Trout Gravlax

I've never had gravlax before! So I was really excited for this dish. I found the use of maple syrup to balance out the smoked salmon was well utilized and balanced for the dish. Once again, another success, this dish was also cleared.

Watermelon

Palate cleanser. Great watermelon!

Yellow Pickerel

This was the only dish I was a bit disappointed with. There were so many aspects in terms of textures and flavors that I think I got lost along the way. The fish was cooked perfectly, but I'm just not a fan of Pickerel and it's texture. I pretty much cleared out this plate too though. Can't leave any stone unturned!

Vinartereta

This was such a cool dessert. The Nordic cake that it came with was such a welcome surprise. I would never have ordered Mustard Ice Cream and it worked really well with the rest of the dish. I never in a million years would have thought I would have liked it so much!

Flapper Pie

The flapper pie is more of a bite than it is a pie, but it was a great way to end such a special meal for me and my wife. I can see us come here again for a meal.

I think it's a great sign of a meal when you clear each and every plate. I felt service was slow at times but I feel that is done intentionally. I got to talk to my wife more than I usually do and made the most of it. It also let me take the time to process and digest what I ate and I appreciated the wait times at the end of it.

This was a steep meal. After everything said and done, for the tasting menu for 2, drinks, tax and tip, it came out to about $300. Worth it for the evening, just not for every night!"}
{"text":"I've worked downtown toronto on and off since 2006 and finally got to go to Canoe and it was very good. 

I went for lunch. While its an extremely business crowd, the view makes up for it. You get a great view of toronto and a sure way to impress the people you're with. Had the foie starter, which was very good and the lobster club sandwich, which was okay, but nothing special. They have great service and had a great meal here."}
{"text":"Went here for our 10 year anniversary. Amazing food, so flavorful and the presentation of the food was beautiful. The ambience was classy and the view from the restaurant was gorgeous! Our seating was placed to over see the lake and the CN Tower."}
{"text":"No tldr on this one. Read it. Haha. One of the best tasting menus I've had in Toronto, and with the best view so far. I went for a birthday date and they did not fail to impress. They seated us right by a corner window with the CN Tower right behind us. I heard once that we feast with the eyes before we eat with the mouth, but that related to Japanese food and how beautiful it generally is. This got us started us down the gastronomic journey before we even had our first drink.

Sitting at the bar was a great way to wait till our table was ready. I called in early to make sure they'd have a birthday surprise as well. They were very accommodating the entire time. It's also a plus that I didn't have to wait 2 months for my reservation, like other places that shall not be named. 

Now the meal, it was a while ago but still fresh in my memory. The mains were game meat but didn't have a gamey taste at all. Everything tasted refined and well planned out. There were some innovative dishes and some simple but great dishes. The portions and pacing were also wonderful. If anything was lacking it's probably the dessert. It was good but definitely not up to the level of the rest of the meal. Kind of a sad way to finish it. But hey, they change it up all the time apparently. 

The most creativity was at the start of the menu, and the main was simple and fulfilling. The result was like a book with a great catch at the start, a satisfying climax, and moderate denouement. Kind of reminds me of the \"his dark materials\" trilogy. Read it if you have time. :P 

The company was also great so that probably makes my review a little skewed. For now this one and people's eatery are some of my favourite tastings in Toronto. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A terrific place to have dinner. Excellent services. Excellent food. Always such a pleasure to dine at Canoe."}
{"text":"Canoe is one the city's most popular restaurants and it's easy to see why. With an unmatched view, cozy ambiance, and great food, it's a great place for a date night or special occasion. The price tag makes it a splurge, though. Luckily, I managed to get a reservation for Summerlicious, meaning we got a 3 course meal for the fixed price of $48. The presentation of the food is well done, and the food itself is delicious. I especially loved the cheese burrata! The desserts were both a bit lacking however. Our main dishes also could have been better...I actually preferred my starter to the poached salmon."}
{"text":"Went for Summerlicious lunch. We got a table near the window with a gorgeous view of the lake and Toronto Island. Service was quick (given our reservation was at 2pm). 

Overall, it exceeded my expectations given the mixed reviews I've heard about summerlicious. 

Appetizer: salmon tartare. My favourite part of the meal. Fresh raw salmon with creamy wasabi/horseradish sauce and veggie. Being a sashimi lover, I I could eat it all day!

Entree: fish cakes. Hearty portion and well seasoned but nothing out of the ordinary. I tasted more bread/carbs than fish. 

Dessert: ganache cake. It may seem tiny but it was super rich and filling! Reminds me of a (fancy) tootie roll. Everyone at my table got the cake and liked it. 

Will come back for its original menu."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place a solid 4.5. This restaurant is a perfect choice to celebrate a romantic evening and/or a special occasion. The ambiance is terrific, the service is exceptional and the food is really good. My favorites for the night is the duck dish and the toffee dessert. If you order these options you should be very happy with the results. The fish is a good option if you want something light and healthy. I recommend trying the toffee dessert if you're looking for something sweet... you won't be disappointed! Again, service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"food is good but not filling! especially for the price...if you are into artistic foods and unique ingredients you will like this place. 

The view is amazing! I would rather come here for the view and cocktails rather than lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"IT WAS SUPER AWESOME! 
We went for winterlicious lunch, and it was absolutely fabulous. 

The Ontario strip loin was my favorite. It had all the right combinations of flavors, sweet, salty and creamy. 

My friend loved the Niagara Walnut Tart. It was the best tart we ever had. It wasn't super sweet and tense like tarts at Starbucks. It was light, fluffy and awesome. She was so sad when she got down to her last bite. More she said, give me more!

Now let's talk about the view.  
We were sitting at table 13, even though it's an unlucky number. The view was fabulous. We could see the frozen Lake Ontario and the planes landing at Billy Bishop Airport. 

If I had to choose one con about this experience, it would be the service. It was good, but it wasn't fantastic for a high class restaurant. I wished that the server would say what the dishes were when serving. Also don't get the tea, it was way over priced at $6.

Overall, we had a great experience. Will come back again :) 

P.S tip: for winterlicious make sure to book at the very least, 2 weeks beforehand. We booked 2 weeks beforehand and only got a sitting for 2pm, but it was still amazing."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant a while ago. Book reservations a head for a window seat. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Friday night.  When you first enter there's coat check. The hostess and staffs were really friendly. 

We ordered the foie gras, seafood platter and some steak dish. The foie gras was pretty good. 
The steak was ok. The seafood platter was decent. Although the oysters were provided by oyster boys. They weren't the best ones. 

The dessert we order was some chocolate cake. The cake was really dry and hard. They ice cream was good though. 

Service is great, They let you test both wines before you order. 

The food is honestly not that great. It was expensive, your pretty much paying for service and the view. 
We went around sunset so you can see the whole view of the city and the sunset. You can see the cn tower too. 

They validate parking for you."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place more but didn't live up to the reviews. Being from NYC it reminds me of a place that gets hyped up to tourists but the locals know it's overrated. 

The ambiance is top notch but the food was pretty standard. Got the lamb and while it was presented nicely it really didn't have any flavor and was pretty average. For what this place is supposed to be that was disappointing. 

On the plus side, again the bar is great and the cocktails are on point. But if you're in town for a visit I'd think there are better places to spend your $ on."}
{"text":"Food was ok....I get way people come here..its for the ambiance and the views...It is a great date place but food is sub-par at best."}
{"text":"I've been to Canoe three times now and each time has been a great experience. Service for the most part is decent, they are attentive to the table and food comes at a decent pace.

Food wise, this is their strongest point. Each of their dishes are plated professionally and also taste great. My most recent visit was for their 2016 Winterlicious menu. The beef Wellington from their entree menu was kind of a miss as the meat wasn't the greatest. Otherwise the appetizer and dessert were delicious.

Canoe's location is also really nice if you have a window seat. 

If you drove down and parked in the TD tower, you can get parking validation from them before you leave."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the experience! It's a really upscale restaurant that I think any fine dining restaurant trying to step up their game should follow. Canoe showcases some of the most delicious, interesting meals, excellent high-class service and a one of a kind view.

The restaurant is located on the 54th floor of a TD building in downtown Toronto. You're already higher than most buildings within the view so you could see the go train station and even the ACC depending on where you sit in Canoe. Canoe is located at the corner of the building so the corner area is the most popular for the view because you'll be surrounded by beautiful cityscape. You could also see into the kitchen at the many chefs at work, it's awesome to see.

The service was great there is a lot of staff around, even when you get off the elevator whom are offering to take your jackets and direct you to the restaurant. They took care of us pretty well, always asking if we needed anything or answer questions about the menu, etc. They were super polite and really respectful, even though we were probably the youngest ones in the restaurant. It's just great when you're young but you're treated the same as everybody else.

Finally, the food was super delicious, most of it had rich flavour that in the moment the only think you could think about is the fantastic meal you're indulging yourself in."}
{"text":"We went there to spoil ourselves, the view is simply beautiful. Servers are extremely attentive and polite. I ordered dinner to me and my girlfriend a main course and an appetizer, we didn't really love the taste of the appetizer but overall the food was delish... amazing experience overall-"}
{"text":"High rise dining is where it's at. 5-stars for my 500th review! 

My boyfriend treated me to a spectacular evening at Canoe to ring in the new year (a day early). If you're in search of a special occasion dinner, this is it! The view overlooking the city is spectacular - the city a-glow along the lake. 

The menu is simple, but robust offering an array of meat dishes and well thought out prairie tasting dishes available a la carte or as a prix fixe 5-course dinner ($100 per person).

The space is beautiful, subtle attention to detail - let's talk about those velvet chairs! The staff was as attentive as they come and well versed in the menu details, pairing options - a fine dining experience through and through.

On our menu for the evening:
- Martinis: Hendricks gin, with a twist and olives. Perfection and also paired nicely with the oysters
- Oysters: among the freshest I've had and mega briny 
- Prairie tasting - trout with pierogi and cabbage in broth: a rustic dish that just needed a touch of salt to bring out the flavor. The cabbage was an unusual standout. The broth added a wonderful element to the trio of items on the plate.
- Matsutake risotto: like a warm blanket of love. I savored every last bite of the dish. The earthiness of the mushrooms with the velvety texture of the rice made this a complete meal and a worthy dinner entree.
- Dessert: chocolate cake with banana butter. Oh my, that banana butter was the shining star of that dessert. So light and fluffy! Like whipped bananas.

This is a place you want to hunker down and savor the evening for a few hours. And be prepared to throw down some $$$. Live a little."}
{"text":"Great view, interior decor was okay, kind of expected a bit more.  We ordered the venison and the sturgeon, both came nicely plated as expected.  Food tasted good, interesting ingredients.  Won't really fill you up though, talked about getting a 3 piece at Popeye's afterwards, luckily there was bread there. Expensive for what you get but its really for a once in a while experience."}
{"text":"The food's a little over rated. Steak was good, however I prefer myself a nice Keg steak at half the price. Great view of the city and the lake, if not for the food, the view is worth it. Just don't go after sunset, the lights reflecting off the window's block the view."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday / Christmas celebration. The whole experience was great. Started with pre drinks at the bar and being seated at a beautiful round table by the view of the city before our reserved time. Service was top notch and the food was delightful. Started with oysters and s'mores fois gras. It was a little weird to have waffles and chocolate with it but the marshmallow mouse was nice and so was the fois gras itself. The rest of our dinners was amazing and the dessert was my favourite! Grape tart made with a cheese centre and a pistachio ice cream. Drinks were great too. very pleasant experience :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful third time visit to Canoe. This time dinner with two companions. We all had cocktails--one Pomegrante spritz, one warm apple cider with spiced rum, and my Ginger Lemon beer! My Ginger Lemon beer had the right amount of ginger kick and sweetness. The Spiced rum cocktail however tasted a bit watered down and no rum taste whatsoever. 

Two amuse bouches and one appetizer (S'mores Foie Gras). The amuse bouche was a bison carpaccio with marinated raddish and some other stuff. It was a tasty bite but missing a bit of acid. The Foie Gras was strange, with white chocolate and toasted marshmallow. I only tasted the foie gras and it honestly tasted like ice cream with a tiny bitter aftertaste of foie gras. In my opinion, ruined the foie gras, ha! My companion said the rest of the dish was good. 

I had the Charcoal risotto with smoked onion, heirloom carrot, celeriac and picked turnips. The risotto was cooked well, just a bit over al dente, which I prefer but delicious nonetheless. The Eage's Nest cheese was more fragrant or pungent but less sharp than Parmesean. Delicious! My companion had the Tea Smoked Duck Breast. He was nice enough to share. The duck breast was perfectly cooked-moist. The haggis was surprisingly tasty, with different textures and a bitter aftertaste--which I enjoyed! My other companion had the ivory salmon. 

All in all, a wonderful dining experience. As always, the view was spectacular. Also, we had no idea diners can actually sit next to the kitchen, so this will definitely be my next seating at Canoe! 

One negative note--we were all a little bothered by the rudeness by the waitress at the end of the meal. She gave us attitude about asking for separate bills at the end. In my experience, most waitress ask beforehand, because honestly, the customers shouldn't be the one keeping track of how the bill is paid, that's your job honey!"}
{"text":"Canoe is excellent. The raw platters are amazing and definitely the highlight. Service can be a B instead of an A sometimes, but the food is always top notch. My wife and I enjoy this whenever we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. Did the tasting menu....nothing disappointed. All what you would expect from a high end restaurant. Pricy, but worth it."}
{"text":"APPETIZER:
The deconstructed beef tartare was like a grab bag of random pickled vegetables and strange jellies. Maybe it's just too fancy for me.

ENTREE:
For the main, I split a chocolate oatmeal venison and dry aged ribeye. The oatmeal actually went really well with the venison because it was soaked in this delicious sauce. The venison on its own was well cooked but the sauce/oatmeal mixtured needed to be more well integrated. The chocolate sauce didn't work with the venison.

I've had much better ribeyes in the past, but I preferred this over the venison because of the sauce flavor. 

WINE:
I ordered an Argentina Mendoza wine, and it was pretty affordable - only $60! I thought the wine choices (in general for Toronto) are extremely overpriced and lacking in variety. While I had plenty of choices, I typically find a much more extensive wine menu at fancy restaurants like this.

DESSERT:
Finally, I ended with the sticky toffee date pudding and strawberry pave. The toffee date pudding was actually the highlight of the evening. It was delicious, not too sweet. I was surprised to like this because I typically hate toffee puddings; it is made and presented in a whole new way. I would recommend.

The strawberry pave reminded me of a strawberry sorbet popsicle. Pretty but wouldn't get it again. It's topped with a ton of almond flavored foam too - not a fan.

Beautiful view, beautiful food presentation, and very well cooked. But the flavors didn't wow me and I wouldn't return given the steep price tag. If you are coming, make a reservation and call ahead to request a table by the window so you can enjoy the view."}
{"text":"I went here for a pre-christmas dinner with my family and we weren't disappointed. The food was excellent, the service was incredibly attentive and very knowledgeable and there were absolutely no complaints about anything I ate.

I ordered: Seared la Ferme Foie Gras to start, Prairies Venison as my main and a tart that i don't think is on the menu anymore. All were excellent - the one thing I can definitely say about this restaurant is that it was an experience in and of itself. The skyline was beautiful, the service fantastic and my tastebuds were definitely stimulated.

I do have to say that although my family is seasoned at eating at high end restaurants, I found it to be a tad stuffy. I wasn't terribly comfortable and it felt almost a little too perfect. Six months prior we had eaten at Forte, and while that was a completely different dining experience, I would choose to dine again at Forte before choosing Canoe.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone celebrating a special occasion, entertaining business guests or otherwise, but I think it just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie I had the stomach flu and was sick before I came here so I have to try it again.  With that said the service here was unbelievable.  Everyone was very friendly, on point and it was just great service.  

I came here for summerlicious.  The reason I deducted a star was because of the beef.  I order my steak usually blue or rare.  They told me they only had med-rare to med.  I figured it wouldn't be too bad, so I went for it.  One piece was medium and it wasn't bad. Great flavour :) but the other piece was well done, no pink at all and it was just too disappointing for me to be able to give this place the full 5*.

Great atmosphere. Great service.  Amazing drinks!!! Really amazing! And food not bad except that beef.  

I have to try it again though, when I'm not sick.  Maybe it might be better no beef though.  Ooohhh the dessert was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely breathtaking view of downtown Toronto! I went here for a Summerlicious dinner and was pleasantly surprised. We chose the hen terrine and the crab dish as our appetizer, Alberta strip loin and prairie lamb for our main, and apricot mousse and berry tart for dessert. Everything was beautifully plated and tasted delicious. Most of the dishes were lightly seasoned so you really taste the quality of ingredients being used. I finally understand what Canadian food is. I really enjoyed the complementary bread as well. Service was fast and professional."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I went with a few friends and one of them was a pretty challenging diner (she was pregnant lol). They did an excellent job accommodating when we unilaterally asked them to change a dish in our tasting menu. 

The one thing I was disappointed with was that for dessert, they served me sorbet and fresh fruit. I feel like they could have done better. 

Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Went here last Tuesday based on a friend's recommendation and during summerlicous. First got here late but was seated without any problems. The food was alright, wasn't expecting great wow factor but non the less ok. The wait staff was busy the whole night but did not check up on us but its ok when you are serving with lots of guests you tend to check up on us once in awhile. One of the food items that i ordered the pork belly is generally the same as the Chinese Pork piece so I was thrown off at that when i saw it. 

As it was just for summerlicious may not come here again for the food but for the wonderful scenery as it was from the 54th floor of a busy downtown establishment."}
{"text":"I went to Canoe for lunch and tried their Winterlicious lunch menu (2014). This is what I thought:

Appetizers:

Soup--too sweet and you could not taste the ginger. It needed a touch of citrus, or the ginger for that matter. The croutons were nice and crispy though. 

The pickle dish (too lazy to look up the name)--really small portion. But it was tasty. 

Mains:

My friend and I both got the steak. It was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and I loved the pea puree. The mushrooms were also delicious. My friend did not want the potato, so they substituted it for an array of vegetables. They were incredibly accommodating. 

Desserts: 

I have never been a fan of the desserts at Canoe. They always taste so pedestrian. But they do look nice. I had the carrot cake and it was plain ol' carrot cake. It was on the dry side too. My friend had the rice pudding and it was too bland. Not sweet at all, and I am not even a fan of desserts that are sweet. The rice was also a little hard. Unless you like your rice \"al dente,\" you may not like this dish. 

Overall, the main alone would have me coming back for more. And you can't beat the service. The staff was excellent!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 4.5. 

Service was 5/5, ambiance was 4/5 and food was 4/5. Our server was great - friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and detail-oriented (my napkin was always folded when I came back from the ladies room). Food had good flavour and fair portions (we did the 7 course tasting menu). However, I just can't warrant a perfect score for food as something was missing. Can't quite pinpoint it. Deducted one star for ambiance because we really wanted a window seat to enjoy the view of downtown, especially because this was our first visit. This isn't a huge deal because it was a busy night (even for a Wednesday!), but I felt like more effort could have been put in to accommodate our request. I did make this request early in advance. We sat in the middle of the restaurant on a raised platform. It was cozy, but wasn't crowded at all. Nice, but again, wish we got the window. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and happily celebrated our 2 year anniversary :)"}
{"text":"The difference of going for lunch vs. going for dinner is night and day, literally.

The only reason we were able to get a table is because others cancelled. Seems to be fully booked on weekends.

The view is amazing, especially at night.

The duck was about a 4-star dish. I tried foie gras for the first time because it came with the duck and that was the dish I wanted, and if all foie gras tastes like this I'm never eating it again. I thought it was supposed to be this amazing stuff that was worth torturing ducks for. Not so much.

Their sweet cherry bourbon cocktail was AMAZING. I had three. I could've drank that all night non-stop. It was delicious! Fresh house-made sour mix (with fresh lemon and lime), simple syrup, cherry bourbon... It was perfect in every way.

The salmon appetizer was also very delicious.

The chocolate dessert also was amazing. So delicious.

This restaurant is really great for dinner. It's a very romantic setting. The view is amazing. Service is professional, attentive but somewhat robotic. A couple of times I had to ask for my drink or more water but usually they were great.

Overall, awesome experience. Great place. I'm glad I gave it another try."}
{"text":"This is for a visit from a few months ago. They had a special on a fish that was cooked by smoking it in a special log housing.  It all looked really cool,  but tasted incredibly bland.  It cost around $45 for that dish and I feel like it was not worth the money.  

The scenery and service is amazing,  but I was extremely disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"Many of my friends have been raving about Canoe, so I've been waiting to go there and try it out myself. I was really excited about their menu and especially wondered how the restaurant would add the Canadian twist in their food. I was somewhat disappointed that nothing to me seemed Canadian (Yes, the ingredients were from many parts of Canada, but isn't that the case for most other fine dining in Canada?) The food was good, but not amazing especially with the expensive price. The view of the restaurant is stunning and the service was good. Overall, it was a good experience, but I don't think I'll be going there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I enjoyed Canoe.  It is elegant in design and concept, however it isn't worth the hype (or price tag). Not to flaunt, but I have eaten at some of the most sought after restaurants in the world and have had my mind blown by many.  Some would throw Canoe in the same category as your Jean-Georges and David Boulunds. They would be wrong.  I found some tremendous execution issues and was even underwhelmed by many dishes. Like I said above, this restaurant is elegant in concept, but this is where it ends.  Foie is enticing, but not when it's paired with one note accompaniments. Duck is exquisite, but not when it's under salted. The food is good.  But it's not 5 star, Michelin Caliber good."}
{"text":"DO NOT EXPECT MUCH BUT THE VIEW! 

Horrible experience recently! Their welcoming staff is friendly, but SOME SERVERS are NOT! We have received such an attitude from the guy who served us. He seemed so unhappy with the orders we made and the time we \"took\" waiting for our friends! (He shouldn't care at this point at all!)

What was up with him we have no idea, but it shouldn't worry us at all...

Giving me a hard a time with desserts by saying that i ordered it too early and why haven't i got a main course. And it wasn't in a friendly way of talking to me for sure! 

Anyways, i can go ahead with all the details, but place like this one MUST have at least friendly and caring servers.... Especially for the prices they charge,

Bad,bad,bad experience...."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for Winterlicious. We made reservations for 9pm, but had to wait extra 15minutes. Service was decent, but food was only decent. The Albacore Tuna was good but the rest of the meal was only mediocre. I would probably come back for their regular menu to have the full experience."}
{"text":"Food is pretentious and subpar. View is awesome. Good spot to impress a date who is not so serious about food. P.S. never go during season-liscious times..."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best restaurants I've ever been.  The location on top of a financial tower provides a spectacular view of Toronto.  The staff was attentive and meticulous about their service and describing each of the 6 course tasting menu that I've had.  Chef was accommodating towards guests who are vegetarian.  The food was spectacular, I really couldn't ask for anything better.  Highly recommended, great value and awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Had an incredible experience here eating at a table overlooking the kitchen.  Start to finish was perfect.  I chose to have the tasting menu, which was amazing.  
I would highly recommend eating overlooking the kitchen as this was a highlight for me"}
{"text":"I've been to Canoe on numerous occasions, but each time I'm less and less impressed. 

It's definitely a great spot any foodie should check out at least once for the view and pretty decent food. I'd suggest during a licious time so you can enjoy some menu highlights and a 3 course meal. 

The ambience is great - just as special as I first remember it. Unfortunately this time I did not get a seat with a view due to the high volumes of winterlicious diners. However, the staff are very courteous, friendly and attentive. 

I was not particularly impressed with this year's menu, in particular the kale and fennel salad appetizer which was in essence a ball of kale which was quite bitter. 

The main halibut was quite delicious, and the winter trifle dessert was amazing! Each course got better and better. 

In all it's definitely a spot I recommend visiting at least once, but perhaps not for a repeat visit. There are other O&B sister restaurants that have better quality food. If Canoe wants to be an iconic food spot, they need to step up their quality and menu."}
{"text":"Out of 4 times that I have been to this restaurant only one have been really good, the rest are easily outshined by much cheaper places in town.

For one, the cuisine is a hit and miss, no steady reliability. Last time I only enjoyed an appetizer but wasn't impressed by either main or dessert. Add to that a server showing up at every inappropriate moment like during a toast, an embrace or while my mouth is still full with food and I can't really answer his question unless I swallow everything without chewing it first. Another time service was so slow that birthday girl was all ready to leave before the birthday dessert arrived, no apologies followed the awkwardness of the moment. Personally I'd go somewhere else where your money is better appreciated."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite high-end restaurants.  It is a foodie`s paradise.  The view from the 54th Floor of the TD Bank tower can`t be beat.  The service is always exceptional and the food is very good.  

I am sucker for foie gras and it is superb at Canoe.  The presentation is beautiful - the plate looks like a work of art - almost too pretty to disturb.  

The wild mushroom soup is incredible.  It has been on the menu for years and for good reason.  It is creamy and rich tasting but has not butter or cream in it.  I`ve also had the steak tartare, gravlax and oysters during other visits and all were good but the foie gras and the mushroom soup are my favorite by a mile.  

The lobster clubhouse is, surprising, not one of my favorite dishes.  It is just so so for me but it seems to be a popular dish.    I have had the brisket and the sea bass but I tend to order one of the daily specials.  

We shared the sticky toffee date date pudding which was good but not great - mostly because I am not a fan of passion fruit as I find it to be overpowering.  

The service is second to none and I always leave feeling well taken care of."}
{"text":"I made rsvp a few days in advance to dine at Canoe on the Thursday that recently passed, and I have to start by saying I was NOT impressed with the wait time, and management. My party of 2 arrived about 30 minutes before our rsvp time. We knew we would have to wait until 7:30 to be seated but we ended up waiting until 8pm to be seated. I also requested for a table by the west window, and understood that we would have to wait a bit.... The hostess told us since we were early our table was suppose to be ready by our actual rsvp time.. But even after 7:30 passed it was always \"it'll be 5-10 minutes\" which turned into almost an hour basically. 

So enough about the wait. Let's get straight to the real deal. Our server was super nice, and provided excellent customer service. He explained everything and anything we weren't sure about on the menu. 
 
The wait time for our food was long too.... But I guess it was sort of worth the wait? Amazing view of the city 

We got the east & west coast selections (I forget what it's called on the menu; appetizers) and it was SOO good. I got the salmon (decent. Nothing special) , and he got the beef with potatoes (he said it was average). The portions were super small... & if it weren't for the huge appetizer dish we probably would leave with a stomach not full. 

I would probably dine here again. Pricey, but worth a try!"}
{"text":"Just an update. Had another opportunity to visit Canoe for dinner during Winterlicious 2012. My experience was great, from the time I called in to make reservation to the time I left (and of course the time in between). The staff were very accommodating and suggest I make a reservation for an inconvenient hour and then call to change later, as they do have last minute cancellations. The service was superb as were both our meals. The view would've been better in the afternoon, but you're allowed to walk closer to a window and enjoy the view (or at least nobody said anything to us).

There was something good on every plate! The starting bread was interesting but nothing greatly appealing. The cauliflower foam on the mushroom rillette (although the plate was missing the gribiche, I think) was delicious. My date's salmon was \"alright\" but many of the sauces adorning the plate were quite remarkable. Both our plates of duo of beef were fantastic, but lost a few \"points\" with salty parts. The brisket and flank were phenomenal and cooked to perfection, which is medium rare. Lastly, we got to try all three desserts thanks to our waiter! The cheeses were fantastic (but not worth it when you have the other options). My date loved his pana cotta, I found it meh. I loved my birch syrup cake but I think the bacon caramel might've been a tad too burnt, my date found it meh.

Wine pairing was a bargain. Total date was $160 (including drinks and a generous tip), what a freaking deal! Sorry no pictures this time :("}
{"text":"I Came here for Summerlicious dinner. 
It was my first time here, so I had a high expectation due to the positive reviews and high reputation. 

The service was good. Our server was attentive and helpful. Great view and nice presentation of the food. I like the open concept of the kitchen. 

However, the food was horrible.
My bf asked his steak to be cooked rare. It came out well done. We rarely send our food back but this steak was just inedible as it was so dry and tough. Our server apologized and brought us a new one. It was better, but not worth the price. The quality was just not there, which was very disappointing. The steaks I buy from Costco tastes 10 times better than this.

Moving onto my dish, I got the Pork Sirloin which was also very dried ans tough that my index finger was in pain from trying to cut the damn meat. I could easily say it was the worst and cheapest quality of meat Ive had at these high-end restaurants. 

The 2 stars goes to our server and the desserts."}
{"text":"Full review in blog, highlights below:

Our first round of food arrived with my friend receiving the \"Mushroom Soup - no creme, no butter\" and myself the Paillotte de Chevre with Walnut and Honey.  Tasting only a bite of the Mushroom soup but listening to Heather ooh and ah about it with each bite we inquired how exactly this porridge-esque concoction was made and we were told that it was essentially a mushroom stock that they use for some of their other sauces with a puree of marinated pan seared mushrooms blended in.  Thick, succulent - the very essence of the mushroom.  My option was certainly a more heavy choice and featured thick round of ashy yet unctuous cheese similar to Humboldt Fog atop a crispy piece of cracker crust and topped with a single almond and lavender honey.  Served warm and slightly melting the flavors of this dish melded flawlessly while the addition of the frisee, beets, and flowers served to add a vegetal component  to the dish.

Arriving next our next course consisted of Applewood Smoked Duck Breast with Lingonberries, Salsify, and Spiced Walnuts for my friend and the Foie Gras with Sunflower Root, Pumpkin Muffin, and Walnut Pickle for myself.  Taking only a single bite of my friend's duck and salsify I will say that the rare meat was delicious and she very much enjoyed the dish.  On my side, the foie was a beautifully cleaned piece-albeit small for the price-and the accompanying components were interesting to say the least.  Crisp and woodsy the Sunflower Root was a nice balance in texture while the balsamic pickled walnut was the very definition of savory.  Small and sweet the a small piece of baked sweet potato and a pumpkin-pumpkin seed muffin graced the left side of the plate and the whole plate showed a unique progression in flavors from sweet and soft to unctuous and creamy to crunchy and savory.

Our third courses were decided on late but turned out to be our favorites of the afternoon - for my friend the Steak Tartare with Potato Chips and Pepper, Onion, and Yolk and for myself Yarmouth Lobster with Yukon Gnocchi, Crispy Sweetbreads, Creme Fraiche, and Preserved Lemon.  As I don't eat beef flesh I skipped the tartare but was told it was \"amazing.\"  As for my dish -without exaggerating this is probably in my top ten dishes of the year.  Flawless potato dumplings with a firm exterior yielding a creamy melt-in-your-mouth center were absolutely laden with fresh butter poached lobster and crispy pan seared sweetbreads while the whole dish was then topped with a creamy sauce of sweetened lemon and tangy crème fraiche.  Half expecting the characteristic flavor of the thymus to overwhelm the delicate lobster I actually found that the lemon/crème/chives admixture served to mellow the sweetbreads while drawing forward the lobster's sweetness.  A wonderful take on \"surf and turf\" featuring two ingredients I'd have never thought to pair - the bite I spared to my friend led her to a resolution to return for a full plate of her own in the future.

After such a sublime meal and great service, Greg's suggestion to \"tempt\" us with dessert really didn't require much effort - we ended up ordering two.  Starting first with the Dark Chocolate Truffle Cake with Sour Cherry Compote, Chantilly and Pistachio Ice Cream. A dark chocolate ganache well tempered in its decadence by the sour poached cherries and creamy Chantilly crème plus a dollop of smooth ice cream that tasted very much like salty Pistachios atop a pistachio cookie crumble - plenty of textures, temperatures, flavors, and nuance.

Our second dessert - again a contender for top 10 of the year, this time in the sweets category.  Sticky Date Pudding, Whisky Sauce, Cherries and Apples, Bacon Toffee Brittle, and Creme Fraiche arrived in a large bowl and really didn't \"look\" to be anything special - at first bite however, looks didn't matter one bit - looking up at Heather I realized she agreed.  Steamed through and appearing to be somewhere between a custard and a bread pudding in texture the date flavors simply melted in the mouth while the whisky sauce ascended to the palate creating a flawless blend of spice and heat with the sweetness.  Further enhancing the experience were diced pink lady apples and sweetened cherries smoothed out by the crème fraiche.  Finally, adding texture was the Toffee - a creamy butterscotch with potent top notes of salt and pork that paired beautifully with the whisky sauce and the pudding both - to call the mélange of flavors well thought out would be the understatement of the year.

I have to say I definitely \"get\" the appeal of Canoe and despite the fact that some may consider it to be a bit too \"businessy\" I personally found every aspect of the execution to be calculated, refined, and full of finesse - if I lived in Toronto this would definitely be my destination to impress out of town guests and on my next visit I fully intend to return for the nightly tasting menu."}
{"text":"If you've ever talked to anyone who eats in Toronto, it seems like everyone has ate there except me. When I say I have never been there people look at me like I'm from another planet. So the opportunity presented itself to eat at Canoe. And it is worth the odd stares.

I would recommend to anyone that hasn't been there to at least try it. Although it is expensive, it is not as outrageously expensive as I thought. Lunch courses are between 20-30 which isn't that bad. What will make your experience more expensive is if you order an appetizer ($10-$20) and of course alcohol.

Most of the stuff on their menu includes words I don't know the meaning of. Shows my high end dining knowledge. 2 of the 3 in our party ordered the specials of the day. One was a pasta something something, I had some beef of some sort, and the 3rd dish was perch. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food and all the flavours mixed in. I don't know how many ways you can cook a roast of beef, but somehow the slices of beef I had were amazing.

What I like about high end restaurants is that when you get your nicely presented dish, there seems to be more \"filler\" stuff then there is actual the food. You look at it and go \"that's it\". Yet after you eat the dish you are satisfied. It seems like at the lower end restaurants you have to eat a lot to be satisfied. Maybe its just me.

I was impressed with the speed of their service. We were sat down, ordered, ate, and paid the bill in about an hour. They were extremely prompt with things and I'm sure they make an effort to get people on their way back to work.

Put 5 stars on the board for this place."}
{"text":"I came to Canoe for my 1 year anniversary and I have to say that it surpassed my very high expectations. My boyfriend and I were seated right by the window with an amazing view of downtown Toronto. We were offered various complimentary starters including bread with an amazing olive oil and spices dip along with a fish dish of some sort (although the food on this plate was literally the size of a penny lol). For my main i ordered the lamb which to be honest I thought would be fairly small but was actually a fairly generous portion. This was probably the best lamb I have ever had. For dessert we had various sorts of ice cream that were very nicely plated. Overall, Canoe was everything I wanted and more. Definitely a great place to come for a date or special occasion. We had at least 4 different servers taking care of us throughout the night and others constantly coming and filling our drinks. Although this is more on the expensive side it is definitely worth it. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant with such a nice view on Toronto, the quality of the food is more than commendable. However, mixing and merging a little bit of so many different flavors in a single plate for each meal can result in an overwhelming experience and, eventually, deprecates the core ingredients (or perhaps the herbs and flowers on the plates are not all to be eaten...). Deserts are (just) OK but (and) much too small.
May go back for the view but, in fact, not that much for the food."}
{"text":"This is by far my best dining experience! We opt for the 67 tasting which got better with every course. The chefs did there research when preparing this tasting. Our waiter did a great job presenting and explaining every course. The view from our table enhanced our meal."}
{"text":"What a view!  Great choice for our first lunch in Toronto.

Retro seventies decor.  Service was amazing.  Attentive.  Friendly.  Somewhat made up for the disappointing food.

My husband and I ordered from the Summerlicious menu.  

Romaine & Endive Salad.  Thunder Oak gouda, toasted seeds & roasted tomato vinaigrette.  Blah.  Bland.

Chilled Summer Sweet Pea Soup.  I'm not a fan of cold soup.  My husband ordered the pea soup.  Wow.  It was cool, refreshing, creamy with the minted Hewitt's Dairy buttermilk.  The small pieces of dungeness crab added a subtle seafood saltiness.

Tree Syrup Glazed Beef Short Rib.  This was horrific.  I make braised short rib as my specialty.  So I know a good short rib.  You should be able to eat it with a spoon...should be that tender and fall of the bone.  Not here.  I was sweating trying to cut it with a steak knife.  I had to send it back and I NEVER send food back.  It came back exactly the same.  TOUGH.

Strawberry Panna Cotta.  Lychee ginger consomme & basil.  Light.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  Loved.

Perhaps, it's the Summerlicious menu that needs work."}
{"text":"I've been to Canoe several times but this is my first review of this restaurant.  I've always came at lunch and I remember the food being excellent.  My bestie had her wedding at Canoe and I have to say it was the best wedding food I've ever had at any weddings I've been to.  If you're looking for a wedding venue book Canoe.  Also my bestie told me the cost was reasonable compared to other venues downtown.  My review this time around is for my birthday dinner.  Canoe is located downtown at the TD plaza on the 54th floor.  The views are amazing of the Toronto skyline.   When you walk in you can have your coat checked.  Our main server was a little cold and unfriendly. But the other staff from the front desk, greeter, coat check staff,  water refill staff to the food servers were all extremely friendly throughout the restaurant so it offset our main server's grumpiness so I'm still giving them a 5 star anyways.   When the food was brought out the food servers took their time explaining what each item was on the plate.  The presentation was top notch. We started off with the complimentary fresh bread with hummus dip. So good! For starters we got the mushroom soup which was a little bland but still good.  I guess it a good thing it's not too salty.  Then for our entrees we both got  the smoked duck dish.  I had mine done medium my bestie got hers medium raw which is how it's served.   I usually get medium well and it was perfect.  If it's too well done the meat becomes tough and dry.   For dessert I had the chocolate + Nancy mint dish. So so good and perfect portions because we were full but still wanted to try the desserts there.  Overall I was extremely happy with my meal. One of the best Birthday meals I've had for my Birthday month.  It's quite pricy, our bill came  to close to $200 for 2 people and we didn't even order alcohol! So if you drink it would be a lot more.  Coming here for a special occasion is a great treat!"}
{"text":"Canoe is a beautiful restaurant, with amazing service. The view from the restaurant is absolutely incredible. The service is impeccable - attentive and informative, but the servers are careful not to rush you. My mom and I came for a late lunch during a weekday, and our server did not pressure us to leave once the lunch rush cleared out. We were the only people left for quite some time, and we didn't feel awkward or as though we should leave although they were closed after lunch service. 

I've been here twice - once for a special lunch and once for dinner. The last time I was there I had a soft cheese appetizer, and for my main I had a delicious fish dish. For dessert, we had Canoe's version of a butter tart, which was honestly one of the most amazing desserts I've ever had. I was upset that I shared it with my husband! All of our guests were extremely happy with their food. 

When we came for lunch, I had a mushroom soup to start and the lunch special, which was a fancy meatloaf. My mom had the very popular lobster clubhouse, which neither of us were overly impressed by. I thought it was pretty bland.

Canoe has great food, and is the perfect place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Great view and nice atomsphere. This is the place for you if you have firends visiting from out of town. Took my in-laws there and we had a great time. Decent wine selection as well."}
{"text":"I went here last week for my anniversary. We had heard recommendations prior to making reservations, and we told we should request a nice table. I did, and mentioned it was our anniversary as well. I honestly didn't think we would be accommodated as well as we were! We had the best view in the house, overlooking all of Toronto at night, it was perfect. We decided to share two appetizers; his choice were the 
Ontario oysters, which were really good but didn't compare to what we have in BC, still really good though! My choice was their p&j style foie fras which was incredibly interesting and delicious! For our entrees he chose the lamb and I the duck. I did not try the lamb as he did not want to share with me, but it looked amazing! The plating and presentation was perfect, and he said it was the best dish he ever had! My duck was OUT OF THIS WORLD, so much flavour, so much creativity, really outstanding! The whole meal was innovative and nothing like what we have in Vancouver, it was so refreshing to try few flavours! And I cannot forget to comment on the service, impeccable, prompt, informative and friendly, even the manager came over to introduce herself at the beginning of the meal, and brought us over a \"happy anniversary\" dessert with wine! Such an incredible experience that we will never forget! HIGHLY recommended!!"}
{"text":"First time I tried Canoe, had a fantastic experience. So suggested this place for a Customer meeting/Dinner and was totally disappointing. Only good things to write about are the drinks, Wine selection and the View (being on the 50+ floor giving a great view of the city).

Food was mediocre and service was outlandish for this fine dining restaurant. Had to keep calling the waiters attention to refill wine, water etc. At one time asked the host to find our server and all i got was a clueless expression with an answer \"I don't know who your server is\". Definitely not a sign of an establishment training their staff well. Overall for the price paid, this was not a good experience."}
{"text":"A friend met me late Friday while I was vacationing in Toronto.  After a full day's work and traveling for a few hours, all he wanted to do once in the city was have an amazing dinner.  He is a wine snob, so I went to Yelp and searched restaurants nearby with an extensive wine list.  This restaurant came up and sold me when I saw that it was on the fifty-fourth floor.  Yeah, I'm that easy.
I tried calling ahead for seating, but was told they were not taking any reservations and we could come down and try to find seating at the bar.  After showing my friend Canoe online, he said, \"Let's just go.  We'll get a table.\"  Well, he wasn't lying.  They were able to get us in even though I informed them we weren't able to make a reservation.  The view from my table was amazing.  The city lights twinkling, the CN Tower, the view of planes taking off and landing at a nearby landing strip prompted me to say, \"Even if our meal is terrible, this view is absolutely worth it.\"
We had a couple cocktails while my friend looked over the extensive wine list.  He decided to go out of his comfort zone and go with a Canadian wine.  He let the server know what his favorite American wine was that was on their list and asked for a recommendation from Canada that was similar.  The sommelier came to our table at that point and suggested one of the most delicious chardonnays I have ever had.  We actually ended up ordering this wine two more times during our trip.  The Cave Springs CSV.  I should've brought some home.
Then we began the culinary adventure... we were brought bread with a pumpkin spread.  It tasted fresh and was a wonderful treat for Thanksgiving weekend.  I started with the beef tar-tare and my friend had a lobster dish.  My beef tar-tare was so delicious and the lobster I tried was pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of lobster so I may not be giving the dish it's due.  
At this point, my friend was so impressed that he decided to get a recommendation on a red wine (his favorite).  Before our bottle of chardonnay was finished, we had a bottle of red there for us.  Honestly, I don't remember what it was and it surely wasn't as good as the chardonnay; but I prefer white wines.
Compliments of the restaurant, we received plates of the mushroom risotto.  I hate mushrooms.  I LOVED this risotto.  I've thought about it at least once a week since then.  Our entrees were just as amazing as the rest of the meal.  I had the lamb and he had the venison.  Lamb is one of my favorites, when done right.  This was done expertly.  My friend ordered the venison at the recommendation of our server.  He informed the server that he's from Texas and hunts, so venison is on his plate often.  The venison was delicious enough for my friend to bring the server and Canoe into his circle of trust.  
This restaurant is a must if you are in Toronto.  The food, the wine, the view!  My only recommendation is music.  We could hear everything the table next to us said and I'm sure they heard every inappropriate thing we said after all that wine.  A little more music to drown everyone else out would make this place perfect!"}
{"text":"My date and I tried the tasting menu paired with wine. The experience was excellent and our server was incredibly knowledgeable. Our bill came to a little under $400 so be prepared to shell out those clams, but for the meal and service it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Overrated. Overhyped. Overpriced. The only good thing about this place is the view. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Love the Canadian dishes that they served when I went. Food was local and the braised short rib was just melt in your mouth delicious. 

Atmosphere was very much suits and dressy.  Lots of networking dinners and business casual lunches held there. The view is also great even on a foggy day."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Toronto. The chef de cuisine, Ron McKinlay, is one of the most down-to-earth coolest people I met during my visit to Toronto. Ask him about where they get their rabbits for the hare cannelloni ; )

Tasting menu is about 140 CAD (including tax and gratuity). Here's a quick rundown:

-Crispy jerusalem artichoke: The artichoke has similar texture/sweetness as a dried date
-Caramelized onion broth with bresola, tartare on celeriac crisp
-Hare cannellonil: a masterpiece
-Main: choice between Coho Salmon and Bison Rib Eye
-Celeriac + toasted hay sorbet: such a unique and sharp flavor
-Beetroot mille-feuille
-Cedar pate de fruits: a little candy 

5-stars. must visit. enought said."}
{"text":"Best meal I have had in a long time 
Had the prawn chowder, oysters, beef tenderloin, and duck. With the milk chocolate salted caramel desert and the berry crumble. 
The flavours were amazing. Best steak I have ever had. Prawn chowder was so tasty. Prawns 4 ways. 
There's a reason this is a 5 start restaurant. Will be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"We came here once on a special occasion with friends of ours. We actually came during winterlicious and it was fairly busy. I recalled the portions were tiny and the bill was as big as Texas. Not worth going to unless you're willing to pay $100 for 2 for a 3 star meal. Nothing to rave about, sorry Canoe. I thought I'd be jumping for joy when we got a reservation to dine here. Pro-tip: Be ready to call a dozen times during winter- or summerlicious."}
{"text":"Had lunch there on a weekday. Server was professional and prompt with service as expected. Their wild mushroom soup was amazing! My main was trout and it was slightly undercooked to the point I found my fish to be cool in the middle. Otherwise everything else was perfect including our dessert. They could work on their coffee though, not the best tasting coffee I had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious 2015 to celebrate my father's birthday and had a great experience. While I have been to Canoe before (Winterlicious 2014), my family has never been nor do they frequent fancier dining scenes as Canoe. 

As always the view was lovely, our table had a view of the lake at sunset and the highway at night which was a plus. 

Overall, I enjoyed their Summerlicious menu a lot more than their recent Winterlicious one. As an appetizer the stand-out was the buffala mozarella with crab, though the portion was small it was packed full of summer flavour! The chicken terrine was meh, not great and their spinash salad with goat cheese and walnuts was nice but not memorable. 

Our party of four ensured that I got to sample all the entrees and hands down the salmon was the star! Tender and perfectly cooked paired with a creamy polenta was delicious.  My father would contend that their beef strip loin dish was the best, he says the potato fry they had on was so good that he didn't even tell us so that he didn't have to share...overall all of us enjoyed the entrees. 

Dessert - wise I had the summer berry streusal tart that was great as well. It had great texture that changed as the cream topping soaked into the granola and the tart. It was refreshing and a sweet-tart ending to the dinner. My brother had the chocolate ganache which was just pure chocolate that I found too sweet but he liked it - chocolate lovers convene on this dessert. 

Overall, the selling point and reason that I will look forward to returning, is always going to be the service. Canoe never fails to impress in terms of service. Our server was attentive and charismatic and even brought out an extra birthday dessert for our little shindig. My family and I left feeling very pleased with the experience!"}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious on a Saturday night and loved it! The view was great and the food was even better. I had the poached salmon as the appetizer, tamarack pork for the main, and poached pear for the dessert. Dessert was my least favourite and that says a lot when talking about winter/summerlicious menus. The dishes were all very very well seasoned and cooked -very soft and tender. I compared the menu between dinner and lunch and they were almost virtually the same, with lunch being priced 20 dollars cheaper - meaning lunch is basically a steal at that price point. Nevertheless, I can definitely say the meal lives up to the hype. Despite finishing dinner before I finished my wine, they did not attempt or make any gestures that made it seem like they were kicking us out considering they were fully booked. Very classy place."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious and had a 5:30pm booking. A lovely window seat and food was good :) I had the foie gras parfait which was delicious. My friend had the poached salmon which she wasn't too excited about. We both had the beef fillet and mine was good but friend found her rib to be too fatty but otherwise very tender and juicy. For dessert we both tried the winter trifle. It was great! Kind of felt like a dessert but breakfast too....I know strange way to describe it. It was lighter than the cake ganache and I saw some people not finish their cake....winter trifle is great if you like fresh berries and meringue! :) Food portions are a little small but that's expected at fine dining and their sunflower bread is good for in between courses"}
{"text":"So disappointed I wasted $45 + tip & tax on a summerlicious dinner here.

What I ate: sweet pea panna cotta (best part of my meal, but still somewhat bland), fried Great Lakes perch (unseasoned, tiny portion, and flavorless), buttermilk & lemongrass flan (also pretty meh). 

The service was great (even though literally every server I saw, except one, was a white male... why?) and the view was beautiful, but wow, what a tragic waste of money."}
{"text":"I've been here on a number of occasions my family and friends for dinner only. I always start off with the mushroom soup and a salad for appetizers and lamb or pork for my main entree. I've only had dessert at Canoe once, which was the Soft Chocolate Financier- I found it to be disappointing. The drink menu is pretty small, but if you have a drink in mind, you can always let the staff know and they'll try to make it for you- I like their Spanish 75, it was a nice twist from the French 75! Apart from dessert being lacklustre, everything else at Canoe is always perfect."}
{"text":"This one is just FANTABULOUS. So far my favorite restaurant in Toronto. 
It is very difficult for me to find a restaurant's all three courses starter main and dessert are delicious. 
Canoe did it!
Excellent starter. Mushroom on toast. I wish I could have this dish again but it seems like this one only offered during summerlicious. 
Main course I ordered pork, fresh meat and cooked so well, juicy and tasty. 
Dessert is mint chocolate cake, I am not a fan of mint, but this cake's mint makes me love it. 
Will definitely recommend my friend to go there. 
Hope they would add mushroom on toast on the regular menu!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Canoe fully lives up to both the value, service and creative ingenuity that people, I think, should expect from a restaurant that boasts as high-end an atmosphere and image (and of course price point) as Canoe does. There are plenty of restaurants that charge as much as Canoe in Toronto, but I am not sure I have been to one that does everything from start to finish as well.  

The food, while delicious, is probably also at least in part unfamiliar, something for which I'm willing to shell out extra cash--you're not just paying for the execution of the food but for the excellence and sophistication of the menu and for a new experience. I took my friend for her birthday and we both had the \"Taste 60th Parallel - Land of the Midnight Sun\" tasting menu. It was a brilliant meal!  

The starter, \"unknown fish,\" was soft, accompanied by a thick cream and caviar to provide great variety in texture.

Next was rabbit agnolotti--fresh, tender pasta, along with foraged mushrooms, caribou moss (the \"caribou\" qualified is just the name; it's straight-up moss), and some emulsifying creaminess.  

Entrees: my friend got the arctic char, which had a delicious crispy crust on it, and I got the wild caribou, which was juicy, perfectly seared, and had a rich gaminess to it.

Dessert: \"Frozen Tundra\"--a totally crazy but amazing dessert. Wild honey mousse with berries encased in an inukshuk-like construction of sweet roasted-marshmallow-flavored shards (no idea how they created these--they looked like pieces of very thin Styrofoam).  I'm not a dessert person but this was out of sight.

The meal was finished with a taste of sweet-and-salty chocolate bark with a woody-flavored jelly on top. A great way to finish off an amazing meal.  The chef or team who put this menu together (not sure if it is John Horne, the exec chef) is outstanding; not only was each dish incredible but all of the courses felt so well planned in terms of variety of flavors and textures. Both my friend and I left feeling we had really been given a new experience.

Of course Canoe offers safer options, which are also excellent and come with their own innovative touches.  But if you want relatively familiar food that attacks all the right mouth-feel satiety buttons (fat, sugar, salt, etc.), you may not feel like you've gotten your money's worth re: food at this establishment--and there are plenty of other places that will push those buttons at a lower price. 

I'd be remiss if I ignored service and ambience. The staff here are for real. They're great at what they do and maintain a great balance of being approachable but professional. You feel taken care of and they always go the extra mile. The view is famous at Canoe and it never disappoints; the general atmosphere is unpretentious and warm. You feel like you're at a high-end restaurant (shout out to the super fuzzy seats--I was petting them all night) but unless you're in your sweatpants, you won't feel like the expensive lighting is judging you. 

Alright, that's enough fawning over Canoe for one day! If nothing else, my enthusiasm speaks to the quality of the experience there. If you want to go baller for some exciting and genius fine dining in Toronto, Canoe will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Amazing view, service was just ok, food was good but overpriced for sure. The duck breast was a bit chewy; the lamb was good but can be a bit more tender; the pork was really nice. Considering how many good reviews this place has received, to me it has definitely been overrated except the view."}
{"text":"I had my first Canoe experience during Winterlicious 2015, and had dinner here on the first night of Winterlicious. There's no question that the restaurant is beautiful - although we weren't seated right by the windows, we all got a glimpse of the Toronto skyline as we were walking in, and it was absolutely breathtaking at night with all the lights. Service here was also great (as it should be!), as the servers were very attentive and took the time to chat with us and tell us about each of the dishes as they brought them out.

While all of that was great, of course the part we were most excited for was to try the food - and I would say the Winterlicious dinner menu definitely had some interesting looking items and plenty of appealing options! To start, I ordered the smoked salmon which had pickled garnishes, pumpernickel crumble and wild rose cream. The smoked salmon was as expected, very delicious, but this appetizer didn't wow me. I liked the way the smokey taste of the salmon mixed with the sourness from the pickled garnishes, and the texture of the pumpernickel crumble added to the dish as well. However, the wild rose cream didn't really taste like anything, so I was a little disappointed. I tried some of my friend's rabbit + fowl mini pot pie, which had chestnuts and cranberries, and again, while it was perfectly fine, I didn't think there was anything special about it.

I knew immediately when I came in that I had to try the wild rubbed venison roast for my main, just because. The dish came with smoked onion, mini potatoes, and berry mostarda, and is cooked medium rare by default, which is usually how I prefer my meat, and I think if it was cooked any more i.e. medium, I wouldn't have enjoyed it. The venison wasn't too dry or anything, but I suppose the meat is just naturally a bit tougher than steak. Overall this main was good, but there was nothing like super unique about it (besides the fact it was deer meat, it didn't taste that much different from steak) or any of the items on the side. I tried a bit of my friend's sirloin tip steak though, and that was really good. It's a really thin piece of steak, so they can't cook it any less than medium, but it still ends up being super moist and juicy and really delicious. Would recommend this!

For dessert, my friends and I all ordered the osprey bluffs honey panna cotta, and quite honestly it's a good thing we all had our own, because it was sooooo good that we would have been fighting over it otherwise. It comes with vanilla poached apricot, pistachio cream and orange scented tapioca, and everything about it was just fabulous. The panna cotta was just sooooo smooth, and then that pistachio cream as well was so velvety and smooth and amazing. If you like pistachio, you would love this. The tapioca was also kind of a fun addition to the dessert. Each component of the dessert tasted great on its own but also amazing blended together. Perfect way to end off the night!

My overall thoughts about Canoe were mostly positive although also a little bit mixed. I would definitely say the food is good, there is no question, but would I pay the full price to go here on a regular day... probably not. MAYBE for steak, but nothing else really \"wowed\" me, and especially given that the portions aren't very big, I can't really justify the price. (Would rate the food 3.5 in terms of price-for-value.) That being said, I definitely would love to come here again for Winterlicious or Summerlicious next time! I think when it comes to Canoe, it's definitely all about the experience, and I will say that I did enjoy mine!"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I ate in Toronto after landing early morning for a weekend trip. I had heard that Canoe was not open on weekends, but fortunately my friend and I could get a table for lunch on a Friday. 

Ambiance: 5/5
Gorgeous views of Toronto, stylish and beautiful decor in the restaurant.
Service: 5/5
Everyone here was super friendly which added to our great experience here.
Food: 5/5
It was my first time trying \"New Canadian\" food and I was pretty impressed. Every dish we had was bursting with flavor and plated beautifully. We had the potato/leek soup and shrimp/heirloom tomato salad to start, and then I ordered the chicken for myself, which was extremely rich in flavor and on the sweet side. I didn't have room for dessert, but saw that the people sitting next to us had a goat cheese cake that looked absolutely delicious.

I will be coming back to try the dinner tasting menu as soon as I'm back in TO!"}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious lunch ($28 + tax and tip) on a weekday - wasn't too busy. Service was excellent. Began with a cinnamon lemonade - it was interesting, kind of tasted like a Christmas lemonade. To start, I had the sheep's milk curd. It was plated beautifully, but the portion was in reality very minuscule. It tasted pretty good, the cranberries with the nuts and soft cheese really came together to form an elevated flavour combination. For my main, I had the baked blue sea bream. Again, small portion, but the fish was cooked perfectly, with a crispy skin, and the mustard aioli was on point. For my dessert, I had the panna cotta. It was very light and refreshing, the pistachio cream was really good - not too sweet, true to pistachios. I also had some of the butter tart, which is apparently Canoe's special dessert. The ice cream was great, but there was some weird jelly on top that did not add to the tart at all. It was a pretty avant garde dessert, and I'm a butter tart traditionalist so I didn't like it much. Overall, it was a great lunch, well worth the price! Canoe is definitely a safe bet for Winterlicious, year after year. Oh, and of course the view is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Went during a business trip and they were able to accommodate a party of 6 on short notice in a packed restaurant. The view is insane. We had a corner table and I couldn't stop staring at the CN tower. I enjoyed the lamb, but had a taste of the duck also- both incredible dishes."}
{"text":"Note: This review is based on Summerlicious 2017 - Dinner Menu.

The parking is free when validated. Good start! The atmosphere at the restaurant is very nice and date night-worthy. The view is great so try to get window seats. The service was mostly fantastic with a few exceptions. A very friendly server helped us take some pictures before we went in. Our main waiter didn't really seem friendly though, but he wasn't rude at least. He wasn't very attentive and never asked us how the food was, but he probably wouldn't have liked the answer.

Now on to the food, which I thought was kind of disappointing especially given the price point. Hopefully, it's because it's a Summerlicious menu, but I have had good Summerlicious experiences before so that's really no excuse.

Appetizers: 
Mushrooms on toast: Actually pretty delicious even if a bit simple - 4/5
Watercress vichyssoise: Nice presentation but honestly nothing special about the taste. Cold soup sounded more interesting that it actually was - 2/5

Mains:
Beef strip loin + cheek: My wife got this one. I tried a sample and felt bad for her and tried to share my dish with her to spare her from this dish. The strip loin was super dry and flavourless. I can't believe they let this one out. I usually like beef dishes in general but this one was very, very bad. The mashed potatoes were good though. - 1/5 (would've been 0/5 without the potatoes)
Heritage pork loin + belly: Pork belly was pretty good. The rest of it just tasted like ham. The veggies were nothing special. - 3/5

Dessert:
Mint chocolate tort: Seemed like a brownie with some mousse. Nice presentation though. - 3/5
Lemon tart: Pretty yummy actually and good presentation. - 4/5

Overall, the food was hit and miss with many misses especially that god awful strip loin. The presentation was top notch throughout the meal, but really the taste should come first and it didn't."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, good service and decent food the view was great. The server was very informed on the food and helped us select items that would cater to our taste buds. I enjoyed my visit and will surely be going back."}
{"text":"Had the tasting menu with wine pairings. Our table wasn't ready right away so we had cocktails at the bar first. A bit annoying since we had a reservation.

Loved the cocktail that started the wine pairings. Everything was prepared well, but I can't honestly say that anything was the best I ever had. I can barely remember what I ate.

The view and service were great, as expected. Our waiter was very friendly and personable.

Overall, a good experience, but it'll cost you a pretty penny."}
{"text":"So, it wasn't my money, so I didn't really order with regard to cost.  Which makes it nice at a place like this.  Very artsy presentation of unique dishes in a great atmosphere/view.  Was perfect for the business dinner I was attending.
The food would rate a 5 star, the service/speed of food would be a 3 star, which gives it an average of 4 stars.  
I had a wonderfully prepared caribou steak dish that had a number of interesting root vegetables and chocolate nut combination surrounding.  Very nicely done.
Good wine and a great view of the lake/city.  Would recommend for an upscale meal or date."}
{"text":"My first time at Canoe was two years ago and I was a big fan of the view but not the food. More recently, I came for winterlicious 2018 and thought the food was much better than it was two years ago. I started with the poached salmon which was surprisingly large in portion and went really well with the mustard. My friend had their foie gras and I thought it went nicely with the berry sauce. I then had the beef short rib and thought that was good but not exceptional. For dessert, I had the poached pear, which came with a spicy sauce. It was good but wish I had gotten the trifle instead. 

They were really busy but service could be better. Our mains took a really long time to get to us and we saw others that came in before us get served first. We also found an eyelash in the food and they dealt with it professionally."}
{"text":"Canoe, I hear many things about this place. Coveted, overly hyped, and ... how they sell moose. I would like to know if the third one is true.

I like the concept they are Canadian and I like the idea of them selling moose (unverified).

So I made a reservation after two attempts.  Went for summerlicious on the first day and it was perfect. Amazing, their buffala mozzarella and the semialfredo."}
{"text":"Great places to take a loved one or ones for a special occasion! The view is spectacular if you have a window table and the food is exquisite.  Layers of flavours and ingredients not commonly used at your average restaurant.  Portions are on the smaller side as expected with fine dining. Service is excellent.  Must reserve a table but we managed to get in on the same day.  So if you have some extra cash and want a great dining experience with a beautiful view you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"SO THIS IS WHAT CANADIAN FINE DINING IS... consider me a fan! I came for Winterlicious 2018 and my experience here was nothing short of amazing. 

//TIPS//
Canoe Winterlicious reservations are known to sell out fast, so if you want in, plan for it! Check their website for info on the day and time that they will begin taking reservations. You can call their reservation hotline or book online.

//THE FOOD//
The server started us off with a basket of their complimentary daily bread, sunflower bread with a delicious chickpea spread. They even offered to bring another round as we waited for our orders!

APPETIZERS
Québec foie gras parfait (5/5) - being that it was my first time trying foie gras, I've already fallen in love with how Canoe does it. Extremely rich and buttery taste with delicious fruity flavours and texture from the pickled apple & oats.
Sunflower oil poached salmon (4/5) - awesome portion size and the dish's flavours were simple but done to perfection. The squid ink chips were a neat touch! 

ENTRÉES
Braised tamarack pork (5/5) - every component of the dish was amazing &  unexpectedly very filling. The pork was still moist, had excellent pull-apart meat texture,and I practically licked the plate clean from the sweet cider jelly sauce! The lentils, crispy sweet potato & brussel sprouts complimented well too.
Alberta beef short rib (4.5/5) - my favourite part of the dish was the short rib! The seasoning was on point and the meat was so soft. Especially liked the combo with the creamy chestnut purée too. 

DESSERTS
Birch syrup + molasses cake (4.5/5) - dense spongy cake with just the right sweetness and loved the hazelnut praline and chocolate sheet texture.
Winter trifle (3.5/5) - I enjoyed the layers and the cream. The meringue adds a nice crunch but I found it a tad too sweet with everything.

//THE ATMOSPHERE//
Located in the TD Bank Tower, once you enter the building, there are elevators that are labelled for a specific range of floors. Canoe is on the 54th floor & there are touchscreen tablets that will allow you to select it so it'll bring you directly up! Stepping out, there's an area that separates the main Canoe entrance (turn right), restroom (left), and bar entrance (straight ahead).

Upon arriving for our 9pm reservation, we were ushered to our seats after waiting ~10 minutes (which was fine by me since I got to take pictures with the iconic Canoe sign haha!). We were also offered coat check.

Our table server and food servers throughout the entire night were extremely pleasant, not over-bearing, and eloquently attentive to all our needs. 

The view at 9pm was already pitch dark and the city line was illuminated by all the skyscraper window lights. I would recommend dining during the day time or sunset to get a more spectacular view!

//OVERALL THOUGHTS//
The food quality was 100% worth the price and the immaculate service was the cherry on top. Everything was cooked to perfection and I'm a huge fan of how Canoe mixes the flavours and textures that embody Canadian fine dining !"}
{"text":"Summary: a fancy restaurant with unique food and super nice view.
Portion: pretty good
Taste: unique and over the top
View: awesome!
Service: good

We went to this place for winterlicous, it took my friend a lot of troubles but we got the reservation during winterlicous. Canoe is definitely one of the most popular restaurants. It is expensive during regular reason and winterlicous 3-course lunch definitely it is a deal. This review is for 2017 winterlicous.
I basically took what the waiter recommended: cod for starter, beef for main, toffee pudding for dessert. Definitely the best value!

Each dish is good in both terms of look and taste. Located in 54th floor of TD tower, view of this place is fantastic as well. I would definitely come back if I could get a reservation during summerlicious or winterlicoius again."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've been in TO for the longest time and still haven't been to canoe. Finally I'm here, maybe it's for the best. At the end I kinda know why this make so many people's favorite restaurant. The vibe is great, love the environment, it's clean. Have dinner here with my wife and in-laws, the chocolate foie gras was just explosion in my mouth, leaving me wanting more, I mean I order two plates to share, but that's appetizer isn't helping me improving my in-laws' impression of me. The steak was cook to perfection, lastly noted the dessert was really good... leaving me wanting even more... I will come back again... to pig it out... at least this time will be without watching eyes of in laws."}
{"text":"The views of Lake Ontario and the city aren't the only awe-inspiring things about this phenomenal restaurant. Nestled on one of the top floors of the TD Bank Tower, Canoe offers uncomplicated Canadian cuisine in an equally simple, yet sophisticated setting. The meats are fresh and the dishes are unique, the service is impeccable, and the ambiance is just as appealing as the food. Our waiter made some excellent suggestions for wine pairings, which definitely enhanced our meal (and overall dining experience). I highly recommend Canoe, and I'll definitely be back during my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Canoe for Summerlicious 2017 and we were excited to return because our first time was exceptional. 
This time was a huge disappointment! 
We were early for our reservation and thankfully we were seated right away without any issues.
Our waiter approached our table after being seated for a few minutes and offered us waters.  
He promptly returned to take our food and wine order. The waiter wasn't rude, but definitely just doing the bare minimum. No conversation or rapport, just took our orders and didn't check on us to ask how our food was at any point. Came by to refill our wine glasses without a word. Even though it's summerlicious I still expect some service, especially at an establishment such as this. I was still hungry after a three course meal!
Appetizer - heirloom tomato salad - 3/5 
 - favourite part of the three course meal
- light, balanced flavour, fresh 
Main Course - beef strip loin and cheek - 2/5
- bland, absolutely no flavour, beef cheek similar to liver 
- portion was ridiculously small 
- only points they got was for the presentation 
Dessert - summer berry crumble
-overly sweet
-nothing special, seemed like something I could throw together at home
-tried to eat it but left most of it

Overall my experience was less than stellar and certainly below 3 stars, food and service considered. I'm giving this review three stars  because the previous time at Canoe - service and food were exceptional and I raved about it for weeks."}
{"text":"Came here for a staff Xmas party at the end of November. The view is spectacular and the staff were excellent and very attentive. The food was very good though not everything was a home run. 

We had an assortment of finger food to start. The beef sliders were fantastic! They had a hint of truffle oil and were cooked nicely medium. They were a little awkward as finger food but delicious nonetheless. The samosas and lettuce wraps we had were ok but nothing special. They brought out sour dough bread but were able to also bring out some corn bread for one of my colleagues who is gluten-free. The corn bread was to die for and was so good that we got an order for all of the tables!

My entree was grilled tuna that arrived quite overdone. The staff were very accommodating and quickly got me a new one that was cooked perfectly though overall was not as tasty as the smoked and pressed chicken that my colleagues ordered. 

The butter tart for dessert was fantastic, warm and gooey though not particularly special as far as butter tarts go."}
{"text":"If you want fine dining, do not look any further. The presentation was memorable as well as the beyond edible tasties. 

We walked in around 9PM on a Friday night and asked if there was a table open. We were told that normally you have to make reservations months in advance, but there was a table for four open in the bar where we could enjoy the full menu. The view in the bar is just as fabulous as the main dining room, so it turned out that we got lucky. 

The artichoke soup was out of sight! I also had a salad that had a quail egg, sardine, and eel. Sounds odd I'm sure to some, but it was delicious! 

You're foolish if you don't check this place out."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Have always chosen their tasting menu option and enjoyed every dish I've tried - though I wouldn't classify any individual dish as memorable. However, both times I've been here, my favorite item was an appetizer play on sweet and salty: foie gras incorporated w/ a sweet element (s'mores in one case and, I think, a molasses and carrot cake in the other).

The restaurant itself is stylish and offers great views of the city. More of a \"hot spot\" than an \"intimate atmosphere\"."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of co-workers and it was a treat. We had one really amazing appetizer - the duck \"Tongue to Tail\" a gorgous dish with exceptional flavors. However, the bufula with the spot prawn fell flat and was so disappointing. Didn't even taste good.

For my main I had the sturgeon - tender and delicous fish that sat on a delicious beef cheek. Surrounding the fish is mashed truffle potatos that were mousse like. My mouth was in heaven!

Dinner on the spendy side but the view alone is worth the visit -perfect for a romantic dinner date or just cocktails at the bar."}
{"text":"Excellent view if you get a window seat. It really makes the experience much better.

The food is good... I'd hope so, given it's so overpriced!!!! Definitely better than the food at the CN tower, but I wasnt wowed!! Best place to go if you can expense your meal!!!

Big disappointment - this is a top-notch restaurant and it still doesnt have their own in-house sparkling water. What the heck!! Most high class restaurants serve their own sparkling water now, doing their part for the environment and offer better tasting sparking water at reasonable price. What a let down!!!"}
{"text":"Did the tasting menu with wine pairing here with a friend, it was such a treat.

The view is spectacular, and the food was extremely well executed. This is definitely fine dining, and some courses pushed the boundaries a bit for my friend, who wasn't used to this style of food, but was overall well recieved. I did the vegetarian tasting menu, and was blown away by the choice of ingredients and preparation.

The wine pairing took it to another level, what a skilled sommelier. He took a lot of time to answer our questions, and obviously has a passion for his work.

All of the staff were very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday recently, he had never been, I've been once with the family. 
The service was really good. Our glasses were always full and our server did not treat us any differently even though we weren't ordering from the full price menu. The downside of the service; we were sitting near the kitchen where we could witness the manager \"speaking sternly\" to one of the busboys every time he did something \"wrong\". While I understand that he wanted the service to be perfect, he should not have done it within sight of the customers.

Food was quite good though not as good as I remember last time... Could have been perception or simply what we ordered. We had the Summerlicious menu, he got the flank steak which was really tender and flavourful and I had the salmon which was buttery and flakey but nothing exceptional as far as salmon is concerned.
My dessert of bread pudding was so so but his frozen yogurt was better. All in all, the meal was very good but not worth it if I had to pay the regular menu prices! Still definitely worth trying! I kind of wish we had gotten a window seat but regardless, the view was nice!
Oh... And their summer cocktails were delish!!!"}
{"text":"The experience of eating at Canoe is definitely worth the amount you are paying. You are able to see the entire city from up here. Also, there is a great view of the lake and the CN Tower. When i went, we had a window seat during a thunderstorm. It was extremely cool to see the lightning  and storm creep up on the entire city

The food presented is delicate, delicious, and different. If you want to come here for Summerlicious, make sure you call the first thing on the first day. The place books out insanely fast. 

Good luck and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just celebrated my birthday here last night. This is my second time at Canoe, first being two years ago at Winterlicious where I wasn't so impressed. However, last night was a different story. Canoe makes me believe again in food that takes you to a magical realm of wonder and exploration. If you take away the glamour of the Mies van der Rohe building (for architecture buffs), the beautiful view on the 54th floor, and place me in a warehouse with the same staff and food... I would still be satisfied and rate it 5 stars. The food and warmth of the staff was that good. The highlighted dishes my boyfriend and I favoured are the Smores Fois Gras as a starter and Wild Boar for the main. Thank-you for making my birthday memorable, Canoe!"}
{"text":"Canoe was absolutely fabulous! The food was exquisite and delicious, and went their for a lunch time birthday celebration. It was just as special as if we went at night and the view is phenomenal. The waiter was attentive and we actually brought my one year old and surprisingly they were super accommodating. They brought some crayons and a booster seat for her which for a high end restaurant makes me give Canoe five stars. Not many high end restaurants accommodate children but Canoe went above and beyond. Thank you! Great food, great eats, and phenomenal service - worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"Summary...

Service, 5 A+ stars
Food, 4 stars, nothing special though. Fancy and beautifully presented.
Atmosphere, 5 stars, was 4 tables full when we went in (Thursday 6:45pm) and very busy when we left (9:00pm)

I like :) Definitely a good place to impress someone. Will return if I am employed and wealthy.

My friend, employed and wealthy, took me here for dinner. Pricey-est place I've ever been too! Ever ever! 

View was magnificent. Better than the 360 restaurant! Food was presented beautifully. Service was amaaaazing. The waiters come out to explain each dish and drink we ordered. Our waiter was so courteous. Our napkin was folded each and every time we return to our table. At the end of the night, the girl who took us to our table remembered that I had a job interview before the dinner, and she wished me luck. I appreciate that too. 

My friend said that their menu changes all the time so that is pretty cool. 
===============================================
The Menu...

For Starters, we had the froie gras, my first time. My friend, a lover of them, enjoyed them a looooot. The waiter knew to split them for us, which was SO nice of him. Anyways, so the froie gras... mmm, not for me! Glad I tried though. I liked the peanuts on this dish, but not so much the peaches from Niagara... My friend liked and ate everything on his plate, and on mine haha.

We shared a plate of beets, which I didn't really eat because I don't like beets.. We also shared the Northern Woods Mushrooms. This came in a little pot, and it was soooooo adorable. Absolutely delicious but I think my mommy can also make this... minus the spice, which I wasn't a fan of anyway.

I had the Sturgeon on Truffled Potato. The fish was great, no doubt. The potato was yummy too, but together with the fish, it was... different.

My wealthy friend had the Ribeye & Marrow Tortellini. He loved the tortellini, and the steak was nice. 

For drinks, I had the Greektown cocktail and I didn't like it, so my friend sent it back for me and our waiter took it off our bill. Awww :)

Conclusion...

Beautiful place, spectacular food presentation, very caring waiters, and expensive. For incomeless people like me... expensive is the key word unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious. The view was spectacular but the food was underwhelming."}
{"text":"If you are filthy rich come eat here because  this place is super pricey,and the food isn't anything special, in my opinion i loved everything service was perfect all was fantastic but for some reason i didn't  find my self fully satisfied with this place, probably because i paid 450 $ for only me and my colleague,the sad part was that 30 min later i was hungry again. It's worth a try if your a foddie :)"}
{"text":"Wow!  We came to Canoe for our anniversary and did one of their full tasting and wine paring menus, it was outstanding!  The service was probably the best I've ever had, the food was remarkable and the wine parings were spot on!"}
{"text":"What a great place in a dazzling setting serving interestingly exquisite offerings....go here to propose....anything! Our city's diamond."}
{"text":"I went to Canoe on a Saturday and it was fantastic! This is one of the better Oliver & Bonacini Restaurants.

TIP: I reserved table #38 after reading an article on the most romantic tables in Toronto ( http://www.toronto.com/article/602554--t-o-s-most-romantic-tables ) - apparently it had the best of the best of views and sparks quite a few marriage proposals. I think the view made the experience.

I ordered the Yarmouth Lobster and it was absolutely delicious! I ordered it as a main and it was more than filing.
Would definitely go again though it a full dinner there is obviously quite pricey."}
{"text":"Situated high atop the TD Tower the journey from the underground parking to the 54th floor was definitely worth it. Thankfully they had many signs making parking and locating the restaurant easy.

We arrived on time for our 8pm reservation. FYI if you want a window side table inform the hostess when booking your reservation to ensure you get one. Our table wasn't quite ready yet but the hostess offered us another table in the center of the dining room however she said the couple occupying our table would most likely be another 10 minutes as they had paid there bill already.

Thankfully it was a short wait and the hostess kindly led us to our window side table. All three walls bordering the restaurant were floor to ceiling glass windows creating a breath taking view of the night sky and the lit up city below.

We started off the evening with two glasses of deliciously bubbly prosecco
Followed by the house bread which was smoked pancetta potato bread severed with a butternut squash and garlic puree
We absolutely loved the bread crunchy exterior, soft chewy interior, & nice smoky flavour from the crunchy bits of pancetta and the butternut squash spread was a delightful alternative to the standard butter. Needless to say we devoured the entire loaf.

After one glance over the menu I knew exactly what I wanted

Alberta Wagyu Beef Tri-Tip - Tree Glazed Short Rib, Raclette Potato Croquette Rapini & Birch Onion Marmalade
The entree was beautifully plated like a work of art show casing the main attraction of three perfectly cooked medium rare hearty portions of  beef. The beef was juicy and tender & well seasoned but that short rib knocked it out of the ball park. Loved the sweet glaze on it. The potato croquettte was like a gourmet tator tot extra crispy crunchy exterior enclosing a contrasting creamy smooth potato puree and the onion marmalade is my new favourite flavour of marmalade

We also got a side of the Pan Roasted Northern Woods Mushrooms which were served in a cute little cast iron pot. The mushrooms had a wonderful earthy nutty flavour, some of the best shrooms I've ever had!

Finally for dessert

Red Velvet Cake - Salted Chocolate Ganache, Sweetened Cream Cheese, Smoked Marshmallow
Again beautiful plating, the cake was a good sized portion unfortunately I did find it a bit dry, thankfully it was sitting on a pool of cream cheese which gave it some much needed moisture. I also loved the salted ganache which was a nice play on the sweet and salty combo. However the best feature on the plate was the smoked marshmallow ice cream - the flavours were spot on! I could of been satisfied with the ice cream alone it was that good!

Overall I have to say Canoe definitely stands out as a world class restaurant from the spectacular ambiance and breath taking views, professional and courteous service, to the illustrated plating and innovative & creative cuisine it just hits all the marks. Definitely an experience worth checking out!

FYI If you park underground in the TD Tower parking lot, obtain a parking voucher from the hostess to redeem for free parking"}
