{"text":"I recently went here for a weekend brunch date. Until then, I'd never heard of this place and my date suggested it. Vendome who? where? was my response.   We made the trek to Sunnyside, parked in residential only parking(it's Sunday, shhhhh) and proceeded inside.   What met us was a quaint room that brought back memories of cafe's in NYC. Great room, decor and the aroma of the various foods cooking really made us feel comfortable.  A valuable lesson for you, don't get there too late like we did(2pm) on a Sunday. So many of the brunch items were sold out and we had limited choice. However, what we were able to order was excellently prepared and very tasty. I have to say I think I have a new favourite cafe for a quick casual meal.  It is cafeteria style, you place your order at the counter and they give you a number to put at your table. Service was fast and efficient.  I'll be back, there's many other menu items  I need to explore.  :)  8/30"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I discovered this place because of the giant line up and I had to try it out. We went as a group of 4 and we ordered waffles, 2 eggs benedict  and a beet salad. We all were very pleased with our meals I also was very happy to see a nice crispy focaccia bread instead of the classic english muffin for the eggs benedict. Everything was presented nicely and the food was delicious!  Definitely would come back:)"}
{"text":"I love breakfast. Like...loooove breakfast. I could eat it for every meal of the day. I am also a lover of good music, vintage furniture and cool architecture, so naturally Vendome is my new favorite breakfast place. The servers were well educated on the menu and recommended the eggs Benny which was amazing, and I also had a very well made cappuccino, it was so good I was sad when I saw the bottom of the cup :( haha. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I rarely give a 5 star but this is my favorite for following:  Coffee is delicious and done beautifully. Latte, mocha, matcha etc  Their food is pricey but delicious. The breakfast poutine is my favorite along with the mac and cheese. Their desserts too..mmmm.  The atmosphere. Inside has many different areas to eat with fun decor and comfy banquet. The patio is great.  The location ..close to Kensington  but lots of street parking but also close to the container park with street art.  Always a great place .any time of day!"}
{"text":"They've just gotten better!  I went back on the first day they reopened and got an Americano. Still amazing! I love their espresso and they are so good at what they do. They use a traditional espresso machine rather than the modern day push button type, and the richness and flavour of the espresso comes through. It's just so delicious!  I'm so pleased to see that they have all the same favourites on the menu, and a few new items I can't wait to try (biscuits and gravy!!!!) I had the salmon benedict today and I have to say it was better than I remember. The soft poached egg was done PERFECTLY.   The space has the same character and charm as before but it is brighter. Floors are refinished, benches are removed with a new one at the back of the restaurant. There is a new bar style seating area near the food prep. All the wall decorations are right back where they were before. Honestly, if you weren't a regular here I don't think you'd even know exactly what they changed but to say that it just looks and feels more spacious.   Also really great to see that many of the same staff are back. That is saying a lot for this restaurant because the turn around for this type of industry is massive. They are clearly passionate about this place and love working together as a team.  Welcome back Vendome! I wish you just the best success in the future. You are an absolute gem in not only this neighbourhood but in the entire city."}
{"text":"The Vendome is a cross between a coffee house and a lunch place. It is very artsy but, at the same time, neither pretentiously so nor uncomfortable. The food is exquisite. I had a butternut squash soup and a beet, goat cheese salad. Absolutely delicious. But don't expect big portions; remember it's an artsy place. Other pluses I noticed were good coffee, clean restrooms and nice decor. Parking is going to be tough. There are a few spots out front but mostly it's a walking destination for local Sunnyside and Kensington residents. The LRT Sunnyside station is just a block away so that's a possibility too. All in all, I can't think of anything that could be done to improve this place. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A very cozy cafe spot in Kensington - perfect for a casual breakfast or brunch. I had the Chicken Club and it was delicious! The coleslaw was nice and creamy. The only downside was that the portion of coleslaw was super tiny. That said, still the best brunch place I've been to since being in Calgary. Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Quasi-literate affectation seemed to be a required character trait for at least 68 percent of the customers while I was there. Could be me, though. You'd think they're all trying to enact EatPrayLove, instead of Babette's Feast. Anyway, the service was perfect. They got us a table asap. The place was packed, so events took time. Which gave my lovely and I space for good conversing. Waitress got our orders to us as soon as the cooks were done with them -- a big plus. If prep time is quite a while I don't care, so long as the food is at me when it's fresh-ready! Now the down side first -- I will avoid the breakfast skillet until they upgrade the sausage. I'm not paying uptown prices for mechanically separated no-name meat product which smells and tastes EXACTLY like those pork-tubes that Lido throws at you. Everything else in the dish was fine. There may have been subtle flavour combinations yet I couldn't tell because everything that made the dish was straight-out mugged by what smell-tasted like Cisco/Safeway/Cargill meat product. Ruined the dish. Believe it. Good news? the jam/compote of fruit was fresh and (on that day at least) good. Some day I may go back just for toast and jam. Worth checking out if you're in Sunnyside, just be warned about that dutty sausage...  P.S. -- the coffee is to be avoided. There is a coffee-roaster around the corner from Vendome. If the owners were actually trying to maintain a good cafe, instead of the appearance of one, they would get their beans roasted fresh AROUND THE CORNER. Doesn't take a rocket scientist..."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of Vendome due to the reviews I saw on here. I don't see what the fuss was about. I've tried it twice, and was not impressed. For the price there are far better places than this for breakfast. I can say I like the idea that you lineup and pay first, and they bring the food to the table, as well as the coffee was good, and you can serve yourself water. The first time i ordered the Skillet Frittata and it had no taste, the second time I ordered the Open Faced Sausage and Egg Sandwich. Eggs weren't done well, toast was impossible to cut through, sausages were cheap stampede bfast style, and there was no side at all, for $10.00 it was a tiny portion, and I had to eat an hour later. I think the toast was a bit soggy because they forgot my order, and I ate 15 minutes after everyone else - no apology either. My friend who had the Ham and Cheese croissant said it tasted great and his fruit salad was mediocre for being full sized ($6). Some of the fruit was pretty brown/soft. My other friend had the same issue as me with his panini, the bread maybe wasn't fresh? I don't think I'm willing to give this place another try, which is too bad because I love the interior of it, and how comfortable it feels."}
{"text":"A great cafe to grab a coffee and/or breakfast. But you should probably get the breakfast, too. The bacon sandwich is amazing (the bread is on point) as were the waffles."}
{"text":"We are breakfast junkies amd like to try new places. Today this was it. It looks nice but you cant fill your belly on looks alone. I have read the reviews and i cant say i had the same experience. It took 40 minutes from the door to the table. Then we had to wait for our food. Another 15 minutes. I have always wanted to try a breakfast poutine and gave it a go. With two poached eggs - MEDIUM - on top. What a mistake. There was very little cheese and no \"gravy\" other than the hollandaise. I can live with that. My egg yolks will do the job. But wait...they're HARD. Let me say that i LOVE breakfast and would be happy if that was the only meal i ever ate. I bust a gut every Saturday. I left this half eaten. On the upside i didnt have to be rolled out of the place but i will not be back. There are SO MANY better places i have not been disappointed with. Rant over."}
{"text":"Salted Caramel French Toast.... just order it. It always looks exactly like the photos, every single time. It is simply delicious. Great presentation and flavors.  I am a coffee snob, and this is one of the few places in town where i buy the espresso and coffee beans because the coffee is THAT good! Cappuccinos here are delicious.   This is a take-away/cafe style establishment. Once you get your food and drink, no one really \"waits\" on you because you pay and order at the cash register. I have seen a few negative reviews because of this, but it's just a different type of eating establishment."}
{"text":"Located in the Kensington neighbourhood, this cute little restaurant thrives. It's busy for a reason - it's good! They allow you to order half sandwiches which is perfect for a small appetite like mine! I got the Italian sandwich with a side of butternut squash soup. So creamy, so butternut squash -y, it was the least we could do to order another bowl to share."}
{"text":"Our favourite brunch place! A gem away from the hustle and bustle of Kensington. Have tried almost everything on their menu - waffles with fruit+cream, duck confit, paninis, cakes and the lot! Haven't been disappointed by anything after 4-5 visits. Add to that a cosy atmosphere to chat / kill time or a nice little patio for the summers.  And extremely reasonable prices for everything!"}
{"text":"The level of service at this place is abysmal. They have renovated it and still not managed to find a way to deliver effective service. The staff is rude, the food is of average quality, for a similar price point you would be better served going to Vero Bistro or Chefs Table, which are located in the same neighborhood and are of far superior quality. The coffee at the roasterie is by any standard way better. Frankly, the only reason I believe this place is busy is that it gives off a pseudo hip vibe and as result people are somehow willing to suffer through what is a relatively terrible experience.  We live a block away from this place and never set foot in it."}
{"text":"Hands down this is my favourite place in Calgary for breakfast! The first time I had the eggs benny I was blown away at how delicious it was. They are always really busy, but the service is consistently friendly and bubbly and I love the atmosphere. I moved to Toronto and I must say I really miss coming here for the food, or even just an americano. 5 whole stars."}
{"text":"Vendome is officially my new favourite spot. Walking in, you get a sense of being in a quaint European cafe. You order at the front and take a table ( if you can find one) while you wait for your food. It may be on the slightly pricier side as far as the menu goes but they serve quality eats nonetheless."}
{"text":"Vendome café I had a lovely evening at Vendome Café on Thursday evening. I had the CHARCUTERIE, which was a selection of salami, Prosciutto and a pate. I could not finish the whole plate and I think it was meant to be shared. My friend had the roast asparagus & poached egg with parmesan lemon vinaigrette, which she really enjoyed. The relaxed ambience and live music made for a delightful evening. The servers are great and made me feel as if I've known them for years. I will definitely try to make it a Thursday night tradition!"}
{"text":"My hardest review to write so far. Three stars because this is a 2 star & a 4 star cafe in different aspects. A super busy spot on the weekend, they pack too many tables into the space, making it cumbersome for all but the most svelt of eat-in clients. I'd rather they remove a few tables and the line-up was longer. We came because of the much ballyhooed French toast bites.   You get seated, then order at the counter, then return to your numbered table with drip coffee in hand if you ordered one. This kind of system can work well, such as at Famoso, where the waitress was very attentive, and there is ample space to move about. At Vendome, our \"waitress\" brought us the food and my cider (nothing special), but never came back to check on us. No drip coffee refills either. I contorted myself to leave the table and tracked her down to get a glass of water, as there was no self-serve station in sight. I used waitress in quotes because with the given high client to server ratio, she is essentially a busboy who brings food. Not her fault, they should have had more wait staff.  It may seem like a small thing, but it's important for the waitress to check how everything is. Served on cream cheese slathered grilled bread, my gravlax was very good, with perfectly cooked deep orange yolks, zippy red onion shards, briny capers, a great hollandaise and a dusting of smoked paprika. Four plus stars.   The French toast bites on the other hand were for the most part quite dry on the inside, not moist and custardy. The roof of my wife's mouth was raw from chewing the bread. The caramel sauce was all puddled at the bottom rather than draped over the bites. Inedible? No. Enjoyable? Also no. Two stars at most for spendy bread either inconsistently prepared, or all the other reviewers are crazy.  What saved Vendome from a lower rating was the waitress gave us a complimentary lemon tart to go, and an apology for the French toast as we were leaving. Not that the lemon tart was that great (tasted and felt like powdered curd), but it's the thought that counts.  Vendome: physically awkward and understaffed when busy, sincere server, some food stellar and some subpar/inconsistent."}
{"text":"This quaint little coffee shop located right by the Sunnyside train station is one of my favorite indie coffee places in Calgary. The food is locally sourced and the ingredients they start with are very good quality.  You'd almost expect this place to have a menu similar to Lazy Loaf and Kettle or Higher Ground, but the menu is surprisingly sophisticated. The flavours of the soups are deep and rich, complex and delightful. More than once, I have stopped a conversation with a friend to say, \"Oh my God, this food is good!\"  It can get very busy in there, so I recommend going for an early lunch or going during the off-hours."}
{"text":"Egg Benedict mushroom and hash brown!!!  Delicious Benedict on top of thin an crispy bread but the hash brown was cold and dry!!! Not sure if I will order the hash again ... just left me a bit tad disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, had a half order of the classic eggs benedict... perfect size!  A lot of sitting room (inside and out), we were lucky and there was not a long line-up when we arrived on a Sunday, but as we were eating the line actually went out the front door."}
{"text":"I just had a very public love affair. With my cheesecake. I gazed longingly at it through the glass. Even reached my fingers towards it a little as I remembered how much I love, and miss cheesecake. Then I read the sign. Hallelujah, this love would not go unrequited! I could let this gluten-free taste treat enter me. And I did. It had all the texture and flavour of a regular cheesecake with a wonderful pressed crumble for a base then a dense filling, just slightly sour (as it should be) topped with a layer of dark chocolate sweetness. I could not talk and eat at the same time as it deserved all of my attention. In between (love) bites I sipped on my ginger ice-tea and basked in the sunshine on the patio.  Like many passionate affairs, it ended too soon. Unlike many passionate affairs I can go back for more. ;-)"}
{"text":"I visited Vendome the other day for lunch.  I love the location close to the Sunnyside C-Train station, and the building itself has great memories for me (cinnamon buns from Heartland Cafe were my second-year university hangover cure!).  Now, it's a little bit more upscale, and managed by the folks who also bring us Teatro, a downtown restaurant.  When I entered there were three people ahead of me in line.  It took them quite a while to make up their mind (\"What do you mean I can't get a half order of French toast?\") and pay.  That gave me lots of time to check out the menu and decide on the marinated beet salad.  It advertised red and golden beets, Fairwinds Farm goat cheese, and \"artisan greens\" or something.  I placed my order and asked for a slice of focaccia as well.  The girl looked a bit confused and said, \"Do you want a side of toast?\"  I don't usually think of focaccia as being toast, so I just said, \"Whatever it takes to get a piece of focaccia with my salad.\"  She confirmed that it would be a side of toast.  As a drink I had some of their homemade lemonade (there's a strange price and size differential between to stay and to go lemonades, though in retrospect I think the extra four ounces for twenty cents actually gets you four extra ounces of ice).  I got my lemonade and my number, and took a seat.  As it was often hard to get seated at Heartland Cafe, I was pleased to see Vendome had additional seating.  So I sat, and I sat.  For more than fifteen minutes, actually.  I don't know what they were doing in the kitchen- growing the beets from seed?  Other people who came after me were served before me, and the clock ticked on.  Luckily I was not in a hurry, but I don't think twenty minutes is a reasonable amount of time to wait for a salad and side of toast in a not-busy cafe.  When my salad came it looked good, although a bit small, and I was glad I had ordered the \"toast\" too.  The salad had small pieces of beets, a few slivers of raw zucchini, pieces of carrot, two or three pieces of cherry tomato, a little bit of goat cheese and some \"artisan greens\" (is it official that \"artisan greens\" = \"Earthbound Farms Spring Mix\"?).  It was good, but not big enough to be filling.  The focaccia was unusually thin, and the toasting had dried it out.  I lived in Italy for several years and I'm not sure this would have passed any Italian's \"focaccia test\".  It came with a little pot of something... considering it was served with a savoury salad I'd hoped it was tomato chutney or something, but it was actually berry jam.  Good for breakfast, not really appropriate with my  lunch.    Overall the meal was passable, but not memorable.  I would return again and give something else on the menu a try, but it won't be a top lunch stop for me."}
{"text":"Well I was finally able to try the Cafe after it was closed for renovations.  I heard all kinds of good reviews but they must describe the place before it was renovated.  The food is well presented but it was obvious that it was sitting around because it was cold when it arrived after a long wait.  The place wasn't very busy so there is no excuse for cold food, not that there ever is. Not sure if I will be back.  it's obvious it has a following but we will see if that lasts."}
{"text":"My new favourite coffee shop in Calgary. DeVille is a close second.  If I'm in the Kensington/Sunnyside area, I will ALWAYS choose Vendome over Higher Ground. It's quieter, there are less hipsters, and I'm almost always guaranteed a table to do work. Win. Win. Win."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Calgary.  When I lived in Sunnyside I used to frequent Vendome a lot more as I was only a few blocks away but now that I've moved to the southwest I will still occasionally make the trip.  They have great specialty coffees and they're vegetarian eggs-benny is to die for (but come early on the weekends because they sometimes run out).  I've also tried a few of their sandwiches, scones and french toast all of which were just as delicious. Great atmosphere and decor as well."}
{"text":"This cafe is located just off the busy streets of Kensington. It has the charm of a neighborhood cafe, and has quite a big patio for the summertime. They do not have table service, but the cashier and food runners are usually quite friendly and helpful. I had the blueberry waffles the first time I came, and they were delicious. Definitely a good option for those with a sweet tooth. The second time I came here, I had the Classic Eggs Benedict. It was good, but not the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had. I love the atmosphere, and will definitely return as I'm desperate to try the Salted Caramel French Toast!"}
{"text":"Perfection , has driven many to insanity . However in the case of Vendome Cafe , a five star rating is deservedly earned. The food is pretty great, the menu is extensive and the coffee is pretty banging. The place has a great vibe , it really reminds me of a  cafe I used to frequent on the Upper West Side. Beyond the fantastic atmosphere and food , what really makes Vendome standout is the staff. Simply put , their rad."}
{"text":"Had the turkey club sandwich and it was pretty bland. Potatoes that came with eggs Benny were super dry and hard. Would not go again"}
{"text":"I first discovered Vendome last winter when we ran out of breakfast places to go in Kensington.  We were sick of Lido, Nellies, Kensington Pub and whatever other cafes the cute neighbourhood offered.  We were just sick of them -- but we had heard there was a lovely little cafe around the corner that we should try out.  I am so glad we did.  Vendome is truly a gem in that side of the city.  Beautiful breakfasts, a wonderful heritage building that is SO cozy on cold winter days, and really sweet staff.  I also enjoy that you can get a coffee to go when you finish up breakfast.    They have homemade artisan bread, homemade preserves, and incredibly fresh eggs.  You know the kind that have that extra yellow yolk?  Mmm.    I can't wait to go to Vendome again in the next couple of months.  It will be a really nice treat."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a friend.  It's cafeteria style, so orders are placed and paid for at the front, then you're given a number to place on your table, and they bring out your food when it's ready.  I got the veggie eggs benny and a soy latte, and enjoyed both.  My friend had a breakfast skillet and regular coffee.  She was not so impressed with her food (found it bland and overcooked), although enjoyed the coffee.    A couple issues I had were: -Though we did order/pay separately, the lady taking our order knew that we were together, and so put us together on one table number.  Great.  I would think that would mean our food would come out a the same, or at least similar times, right?  Not so.  My meal arrived around 15 mins before my friends.  Wanting to eat while it was warm and fresh, and assuming hers would be out shortly, I started eating soon after it arrived.  I was nearly finished by the times hers was delivered.  That length of time delay didn't seem right to me. -I suppose maybe this is par for the course in a cafeteria style place, but apart from dropping off the food, there seems to be no service at this cafe.  No quality check, no clearing plates or cups, no coffee refills unless you go up and ask.  And it was not particularly busy while we were there (plenty of empty tables the whole time). -Was quite noisy.  Plates and cups being loudly stacked or placed into the dishwasher.  Music seemed a bit too loud for easy conversation or getting work done.  Overall I thought the space was nice, and my food was good.  However, with the details and service lacking, and many other good dining options around, I don't see myself rushing back."}
{"text":"This place is more hype than actual substance. I've been a number of times, both pre- and post-renovations. Although aesthetically there are a few (minimal) upgrades to the look and feel of Vendome, the service remains essentially clumsy, with a confusing ordering system, a cluttered blackboard menu difficult to read, unappealing-looking baked goods, average coffee, uninterested staff, and a congested entrance due to customers waiting in a long lineup to order.  In addition, the menu choices are just average for a brunch place, although on the pricy side. For a breakfast for two, consisting of two espresso drinks and two dishes (typically an order of eggs benny, and an order of waffles), we would end up with a $40 bill. Neither the food, the service nor the atmosphere are memorable in any way  The icing on the cake for me was during our last visit on an early Sunday morning, where I decided to stop over to take a tea latte to go before hitting the road. We beat the crowds as the shop was not busy yet, however upon ordering the lineup started building up. As it turns out, I had waited for over 10 minutes for my tea latte and still no sign of my beverage, while orders continued to come out for customers that had ordered after me. Unsurprisingly, they had forgotten about it! I had to ask the barista for it again, and the barista proceeded to prepare my beverage and deliver it in an annoyed manner.  I've given this place enough tries and I fail to find a reason why I should come back. Don't think that will happen, given that there are plenty of wonderful bakeries, coffee shops, and brunch places in the Kensington area alone."}
{"text":"Amazing space, great staff, good food. The lineup isn't quiet as bad as I was expecting from past reviews, and I was delighted by the ambience - low key, elegant, and welcoming. They were even playing my beloved swing music - which is guaranteed to put me in a good mood even in the morning! We both ordered Eggs Benny (mushroom with lemon cream and ham varieties) and asked for our eggs well poached. Unfortunately, we got them very undercooked, and had to send it back. However the staff was super-understanding and polite, and the second attempt produced what's probably the most delicious eggs I've ever tasted (Seriously, why doesn't everywhere offer free range eggs yet?). The rest of the meal was good (nice hash browns, good bread for the bennies, etc.) and they make a decent chai latte. Only issue was the price - as much as I enjoyed Vendome, $40 for breakfast for two is just too much, especially if it isn't out of this world amazing :("}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Vendome and suffered while they were closed during their renovations! The french toast is absolutely divine!"}
{"text":"By far my favourite Cafe shop in Calgary!!  Favourite Dish: Butternut Squash Soup!   I recently discovered this hidden gem right beside the Sunny Side CTrain Station in the Kensington area. Upon entering this cafe my first impression that it was a bit crowded and rundown, but super cute! It had an upbeat, yet relaxing ambience.   On my first visit, I decided to come here with a friend to study. Of course we got distracted by all the food options!  I ordered a Duck Confit Paini and the Butternut Squash Soup. My friend ordered the Free Range Chicken Pot Pie. I'd have to say we were both completely satisfied with our meals. The soup was perfect! It wasn't too sweet nor too creamy. In fact, it was SO irresistibly delicious I had to come back two days later because I had an intense craving for it! I also ordered the Beet Salad on my second visit and of course, I was definitely pleased with my choices.   The cafe is unique in that you order and pay for your food at the counter and you are given a number. Once you have chosen a seat after you have ordered, the staff bring you your food. I wouldn't call the safe waiters or waitresses, but they did make the effort to ask me how the food tasted after I had my first bite. I was definitely impressed!  Price wise, every item is less than $15 so it is definitely affordable! The quality of the food is definitely worth the price. This is especially true when you're comparing this place to a Starbucks/Good Earth/Second Cup.   I will definitely come back for more Butternut Squash soup! YUM!!!! And of course I would definitely recommend this place! :)"}
{"text":"Blueberry Bran muffins still warm moments after they open. Usually sold out shortly thereafter. If your lucky enough to frequent this place early morning it is the only real time to go. They serve up a decent cup of joe as well !! Had the eggs benny here once, and at every other place in town that everyone raves about. Unfortunately I cannot tell the difference between any of these breakfast places. They all taste the same to me. So my advice is stick with the Blueberry Bran and a tastey coffee to go and head out for an early morning walk !!!"}
{"text":"I go to the Vendome frequently, as it is conveniently located at the Sunnyside C-Train Station.   The coffee is great, as is the food. The Chicken Club is absolutely delicious, as are the White Chocolate Raspberry Scones."}
{"text":"Right by the c-train station in Sunnyside, plenty of street parking nearby, pretty quiet location but just steps from 10th St and Kensington Ave. Located in one of Calgary's heritage buildings, it get lots of light and has a great patio. Décor is rich and funky giving the place has a warm, hip vibe. There were all kinds of people: students, seniors, suits, sisters, etc. Not a huge menu. Perhaps this café might be better suited for grabbing a freshly baked treat than a meal. Paninis are dry, which is odd because they are at the same time soaked with mayo and saturated with cheese. Roasted potatoes were soggy and needed seasoning. The food is why I am only giving this place a 3/5 - if you mess up sandwiched and potatoes.... I will return to try the baking, especially because my espresso was perfect.  Service was fine and dandy. I read a previous review about the café getting another till, but this is not a Starbucks. The pleasant, neatly dressed staff and timely service were a-ok. Great location, great vibe, great coffee, but food needs improvement."}
{"text":"I love Vendome Cafe for its sunny-side atmosphere and more importantly, it's amazing food. I've eaten here a few times with family and friends trying a new meal every time. Everything is delicious. Keep it up."}
{"text":"i am in love with this place. it is so charming and adorable. a little busy, but worth the wait. duck confit sandwich is absolutely on point. mmm i want to be there right now."}
{"text":"Fun place, good food. Probably the best hollandaise sauce I have ever had. One word - BUTTER! My only gripe is that you have to pay a dollar if you want a second cup of coffee.   Come give it a try."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go in Calgary for a casual lunch.  Vendome Cafe is a great places to meet up with friends or spend time catching up with something good to read.  Vendome offers much more than food that you normally find at the typical cafe.  One of my favorite items is the Duck Confit Panini.  You will not be disappointed!  Look forward to going back the next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Vendome embodies everything wonderful about Sunnyside; a cute, little approachable place with sunny windows, nice staff, decent lattes and excellent food.  I like it here, the atmosphere is relaxing, and I feel slightly teleported into a small town that's suspended somewhere between the North American west coast and Europe.  This is a popular place with the Sunnyside folk, so on the weekend expect a long line and a slightly longer than average wait for the food. They also frequently run out of egg benedict. I am one of the lucky ones; I've tried the eggs benny and it's pretty darn delicious. So it makes sense that they run out.  Overall Vendome attracts an eclectic clientele while serving better than good food. Last time I was there, the server, three strangers and I discussed whether or not it's cruel to eat duck because ducks are cute...   See you there! T."}
{"text":"I love this place for brunch. The French toast item has recently changed... Nonetheless still absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The wait to order food was way too long!! The food wasn't anything extraordinary especially after lining up for over an hour just to order!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, Euro pastries and great breakfast for weekdays or weekends"}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing little building, fantastic food and great ambience. I've had the spicy tuna sandwich a few times now and have to say it's the best I've had anywhere, and then tried the Caesar salad on my last outing which was interesting - and good. The salad was basically a couple fresh romaine leaves with fresh bacon, cheese and a cooked egg cracked over it. Wasn't sure I was going to like it at first but after one bite I knew I made the right choice and will def. be trying it again.  I'm not a coffee guy, which this place would be great for, but I am a sucker for the old style orange so-dee-pops they have in the glass bottles.  Seating is always a touch tight, but once you try the food you forget about it anyhow. :)"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere located in sunny side just shy of Kensington. The food here is top notch. Breakfast staples taken to the next level."}
{"text":"Love this Cafe! One of my favourites in Calgary. Yummy food and great atmosphere. Sweet staff as well."}
{"text":"I've always tried to limit my five stars ratings.  As my college professors always said, \"If I give you an A+ how are you to improve for the next time.\"  But I'm all too happy to bring out a 5-star rating when it absolutely deserves it and Vendome definitely does!  The best part of this cafe is the service.  While most joints under a year old have a rotating stuff of less than grateful baristas, Vendome has been able to maintain an amazing staff that is always courteous, polite and genuinely kind.  Saying things like, \"Make sure you come back for your free refill\" adds that extra piece of customer service all but lost in the service industry.  The food is also out of this world delicious.  Every meal is made specifically for you and if it isn't, it certainly looks like it.  My mouth is watering right now just thinking about their paninis.  Is it weird if I go back more than once a day?  If you are visiting the Kensington/Sunnyside area, don't go for the obvious choice of Starbucks or even Second Cup.  Walk the extra block and check out Vendome.  You'll probably see me there."}
{"text":"Food's excellent. Favorites are Duck Confit Panini, and Spicy Tuna Melt Panini. The soups are usually good and the coffee--I only order dark roast--is good, although I'd prefer it a bit stronger. The grainy mustard aioli that accompanies the panini is good, but really rich--so dab sparingly. They should be putting the slaw in a bigger tub 'cause it's really good, but almost tauntingly spare.   I have a couple of pet peeves about this place which prevented me from giving it full marks:  - the open kitchen is noisy--mostly from plates being mercilessly banged against each other--in the sink, while plating, stacking...so I usually try to retreat into the inside area with the hanging shades  - speaking of this area... There are a lot of black surfaces--black planks on the display window, black upholstery, black shades, a really funky antique black klieg light at the end--and the thing with black surfaces is that u need to constantly dust and wipe. In the morning light, it's unforgiving. There was almost a half-inch thick coating of dust and lint on the hanging shades on top of our tables I couldn't help thinking some of it was landing on the food. It's called a vacuum, folks. Use it.  - the staff--most of them, not all, to be fair, are not the warm, affable kind we Calgarians are used to. They do the job, albeit, in blasé fashion"}
{"text":"First time trying out the new cafe in the old heartland cafe location in a visit back to Calgary after five years.  I was underwhelmed.  Great atmosphere and good service but the price for the food was just not worthy in my opinion.   I paid $12 for waffles.  One waffle cut into four small pie shapes.   The fresh homemade whipped cream with vanilla in it was great but unexpected as it wasn't on the menu.  The maple syrup and blueberries were good.  My friend had eggs Benny for $15 and again a small portion for the \"full size\".  The flavour was acceptable but needed more holland aide sauce and the eggs weren't cooked as ordered.  My chai latte tasted like a powdered mix.   I don think I would go back on my next trip to Calgary.  So many other great breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the fact that you can get half a sandwich! Vendome is a great addition to the cafe scene in Kensington."}
{"text":"I will not be returning to the Vendome Cafe'. I was looking forward to trying it after the many great reviews I have read on Yelp. I guess those reviews are outdated. We arrived and paid (and tipped) in advance. (That is their system). The first few blunders - over filled and spilled drinks, no saucer for my companions t-bag were awkward but forgivable. Then, over a 30 minute wait for the Salmon Eggs Benedict and that arrived cold. The waitress did not check on us and by that point I had enough of this place. My latte was uninspiring so only drank 1/2. The chocolate cake was just okay."}
{"text":"I just enjoy this establishment so much. It feels very Euro in it's decor and a little leaning to the hipster side of things. In the summer the patio outside is just fantastic with the sun shining down on Sunnyside. The food is usually spot on with interesting and fun menu choices and great coffee. It does require some patience though. Weekends are insane here, very crowded... not really my cup of tea as i am not big fan of long lines and waiting. Service can be a weeeee bit on the slower side of things from time to time. During the week days and evenings is the best time to go."}
{"text":"Vendome Café is by far, the best place to go to for the most delicious eggs benny ever! Not only are they famous for their bennies, but they always have the best deserts as well that they always change up, as well as so many other good menu options as well. They have breakfast, lunch, and some dinner items, but in order to really experience Vendome, you need to go there for their breakfast! They are a little bit expensive, but most private cafes are like that anyways, and in the end, the money is completely worth it. Instead of an English muffin, the eggs are served on top of a Panini, which is significantly easier to cut and it makes breakfast so much more enjoyable vs. fighting with your English muffin every time. I always have the salmon eggs benny, but I've also had many of their items as well and I have yet to be disappointed! The food is honestly amazing. If you go on the weekends, be sure to get there bright and early, especially in the winter, because due to the café being so small, it's guaranteed you'll have to wait outside and line up, no matter what the weather is like. In the winter, it's such a cozy, warm place to be, and it creates a home-like atmosphere, and in the summer, it's really sunny thanks to all the windows, and it's very bright which is always nice. The only thing I don't enjoy about Vendome in the summer is the amount of flies and wasps that are all over, due to the door always opening and closing, but I can live with that. The staff are always so nice and the food comes out exactly how you would want it. I'm so glad I discovered Vendome about 2 years ago, and I don't plan on taking my business anywhere else! :)"}
{"text":"Vendome is an adorable, trendy, and casual cafe in a great neighborhood.  It is the only restaurant we stopped in on our way from Calgary to Banff.  Based on the crowd, you'd think you were sitting in a cafe in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  That's usually good news when it comes to a restaurant.  Where the hipsters are, there is usually fresh \"foodie friendly\" bites.  The tomato soup was delicious.  It was clearly 100% homemade.  The grilled veggie panini was a great partner to the soup.  Spend all day there with your Mac (pcs discouraged ;) ) or drop in a for a great lunch."}
{"text":"I came back here with a few friends for brunch and we had their Caramel French Toast with whip cream. It was delicious!  This was my first time eating a meal here. I always come here for coffee. I love the feel and vibe here much better than Higher Ground. I'm going to start coming here more often for their breakfast and brunch.  Overall, best coffee shop in Calgary."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the top five brunch places in Calgary. The mushroom egg Benedict never fails you."}
{"text":"Our new favourite brunch place in town! The traditional benny and the breakfast poutine were delicious and their little patio is great. Super fast service. Ice mocha was super tasty but their drip coffee was really weak. Can't wait to go back to the all their tasty looking deserts and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food is still satisfactory at best. My friends and I went during lunch time so it was busy. My friend and I came early and sat at a table better suited for two. Instead of waiting for a larger table, I politely asked one of the staff if we could pull another table to make room for 3. The staff sharply replied \"I don't care.\" I know this is a hip place but I found his reply particularly crass. Anyway, I considered that piss-poor service. I ordered a sandwich and honestly, it felt dry and old. Nevertheless, I was full.  My recommendation is that the staff need to really reflect and review on customer relations. Specifically that guy who told us he didn't care. Perhaps he needs to start caring how he talks to customers before he loses his job? Just saying that it's a pretty tough economy out there right now!"}
{"text":"Like this place to go and meet a friend at. The food is good they changed the chef so they are still working to make the menu better or how it used to be but generally a good place to go meet a friend."}
{"text":"Went to the Vendome because when we walked by on the way to the Greek restaurant yesterday I saw they had all day \"Breakfast/Brunch\".   Inside it's a quaint little coffee shop type atmosphere.  I loved the mochas (tasted like really velvety luxurious hot chocolate with espresso!). I had the French Toast w/Caramelized Bananas and a side of bacon, and the man had a Fritata which came in a cute little baby cast iron skillet.   We loved everything, and will be back for more. I felt the prices were average for the quality of food provided. You should check these guys out."}
{"text":"Not my first choice by a long shot, which is a shame as it is the closest place for us to walk to! They take your money and order before knowing if there is somewhere for you to sit and eat. Atmosphere is good, staff is pleasant. Food has been good. I like their bennys and butternut squash soup. Boyfriend had the yogurt parfait which was not sweetened at all and didnt come with the option to sweeten. Coffee is good but not remarkable, and if you just want a coffee, expect to wait a lot longer than other places in the area."}
{"text":"Having taken over the old Heartland Cafe location, Vendome Cafe had big shoes to fill and I'm happy to report that they have more than delivered.  Located in Sunnyside, Vendome is an artsy cafe that serves up healthy, fresh and most delicious meals.   Brought to you by the folks of Teatro, it's no wonder that the food is presented so perfectly and tastes so darn good.  Aside from ordering breakfast and lunch, you can also order espresso drinks and gourmet goods. Their cinnamon buns are especially delicious!  Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly.  A perfect cafe in a perfect location. What more can I possibly say?"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop with good food and coffee. Tried different coffees and teas and all have been good. I've tried meals and snacks and most have been really good. Recommended."}
{"text":"Enjoyed brunch at Vendome cafe. Only thing I don't like about the experience there is having to order first and have the food come to you later. I would much rather have the option of ordering at the table incase there was something I want to add to my meal"}
{"text":"I love Vendome Cafe, the food and atmosphere is amazing.  I typically go here for brunch on the weekends and it is always very packed however I always seem to find a spot.  Best brunch in Calgary :)"}
{"text":"As a Calgary visitor, I was on a mission to find the best espresso and Americano. Thus far, after trips to Starbucks, Kienna, Euphorias, Analog I failed with each serving flavorless watery concoctions until I arrived at Vendome Cafe. I'm happy now. When I visit Calgary again, I'll skip the others and come directly to Vendome."}
{"text":"I revisited Vendome just to see if the Crab Eggs Benedict was available that day, as I had missed it last time. And lo and behold, they had it! I ordered, and went to my table to take a seat.  When the meal was brought to my table, and I dug in, I was in heaven. This is was probably the best Eggs Benny I've had in Calgary so far. The crab meat was a bit spicy, and meshed deliciously with the perfectly cooked eggs benedict and hollandaise sauce. Absolutely mouthwatering.   Love love love this place. I wish every brunch/breakfast place was this good. Pricey yes, but SO worth it!"}
{"text":"Good food. Slightly pricey, but great ambience."}
{"text":"A quaint little cafe in Kensington! Don't let the small building fool you, it's way bigger on the inside. Everyone working there was great with recommendations on the food for someone who's never been there before. The butternut squash soup is one of the best I've ever had! You gotta try it. Creamy, velvety, and full of flavor, even a little crunch from the green onions. The next time I come back, I'm getting the French toast. It looks so decadent that it has to be considered dessert for breakfast. Speaking of desserts, if you like lemon, the lemon meringue tart was like biting into a sweet lemon. And the coffee, fo'getaboutit. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu (but get the latte."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Vendome for a late lunch it was amazing .. If you are passing through Sunnyside .. and you want  great food .. this is the spot .. great service & terrific food .."}
{"text":"Go here for breakfast. Stay for lunch. Or don't worry about it because you can order breakfast until 3pm!   Have had breakfast and lunch her and nothing is a bad choice. Greta coffees. But their London Fog is to die for. Order one to stay, then get another one to go.  Just so good!"}
{"text":"We visited this small cozy cafe for a quick late lunch and study / post-exam session before an early supper.  There was a variety of items including breakfast until 5pm, some between-breads, desserts, lunch and hot meal options, as well as a variety of drinks.  Initially there was quite a line up at the ordering counter but we did  find some space in the other room and sat ourselves.  Atmosphere:  4/5  I really like the Kensington area in Calgary and the cafe had a good nonchalant feel.  Customers were free to seat themselves then order at the counter then the food is brought to your table. Great for sitting alone to work or meeting others for a quick coffee or lunch.  It was not too loud or quiet.  There is some street parking across the street which was handy and the train is close.    Food: 4/5  I had the Thai noodle salad bowl with peanut sauce on the side and a house blend herbal tea.  It was good overall.  Reasonable portion size for what I was looking for and reasonably priced.  Service: 3/5  Our orders arrived within a reasonable time and the area was overall kept clean.    Price: 3/5  Reasonable  Overall I would come back again.  I like the overall atmosphere of the cafe, this part of town, and the various food options regardless of time of day; would've loved to try some of their other menu items as well!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch today and the cashier wasn't all that nice, we had forgotten it was order at the front first and then sit down with a number. She wasn't helpful or pleasant on guiding us on the dining procedure...  We ordered two bennies, classic and mushroom. Our order came to $41 with two brewed coffees and a cookie and we still tipped $10 even though we felt service was mediocre at best. We went up and asked if one of us could have a coffee refill but the girl said we had to go to the back of the line and pay $1. When a girl clearing tables walked by I asked if we could get the coffee before we were done eating and pay later when the line shortens and she was nice enough to bring some to our table.. The flow of the line seems backwards as you order at the till and the ppl in line seem to have to move out of your way so you can pick your coffee up at the other end of the counter.. food arrived quickly which was good and was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Really good coffee in a nice location in Sunnyside.  The only downside is the early closing times and often lack of seating space on the weekends."}
{"text":"The eggs benedict came cooked with hard eggs.... Tasted terrible.  I may give it another chance and try the place again, but advice is to specify that you don't want your benny hard boiled because the clerk never asked."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite brunch place in the city! the food is absolutely delicious (the blueberry waffles make my mouth water just at the thought of it) and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The place is very clean, even down to the bathrooms which are exceptionally well kept. The atmosphere is delightful, bustling but never too noisy. the lay out is cozy - even though they have a lot of space, the layout makes the entire place feel more intimate and homely. They have flowers on each table, which makes my day every time! out of ten, I'd give this place a hundred. That's how great it is!"}
{"text":"Meh... I was super excited about this place based on reviews.  First thing the line. Absolutely ridiculous an hour seriously. Why not sit people and take orders instead of having one line for people who are hoping to sit for their breakfast and those who want coffee to go??? I assume that this supposed to make a good impression as if this place is worth waiting, well it's not that special.   I was very impressed being asked how I want my eggs Benedict. I opted for soft. After waiting another 30 min after ordering, I was served completely well done eggs. As if you place hard boiled eggs on top. I was looking for a waiter I ordered with to point out that this is not what I ordered and to be fair I tried it and it just didn't taste right so I would not enjoy my 16$ breakfast. To my surprise, the guys said that I can have dessert on a house. Nice gesture but what about my breakfast I asked. He said if I want new portion than I will have to wait as if I joined the line?!   As far as I know the cook overcooked my breakfast and I should not be penalised. So seeing my disappointment he offered to give me money back. I thought OK I will take my money back. One of my friends spotted that he was getting my money from the tip jar. I felt slightly bad about it but then hey, what's the point of asking how you want your eggs to be cooked? And with all respect, after waiting 1 hour and 30 min, a slice of cake didn't sound like a treat. I was annoyed and extremely hungry. Won't be back for sure."}
{"text":"When I'm too tired to cook and want a quick bite this is where I head.  Their chicken club toasted sandwich is such good comfort food.  I also love the duck sandwich which I never thought I'd be partial to.  My only disappointment with Vendome is the type of soy they use, it's so high in fat I get stomach cramps every time I've had one of their lattes (the first time I thought it was just a bad latte then it happened a second time and well I'm not trying a third).  It would be a perfect five if they could bring in some light soy as I just can't drink their regular stuff."}
{"text":"Flavours right up there, pleasant free vibe, and great homey presentation... Have been there some... Lattes good, food nicely-prepared and somewhat off the map, positively.  Cool staff, and quiet neighbourhood where traffic not an issue.  Would return more often if lived closer..."}
{"text":"Love this venue.  Great place to meet for coffee - and be sure you will be tempted to order something from their menu!  Located across from the LRT station in Kensington, a block off 10th street.  Street parking is always available, if free spots taken, there is always room in the metered spots.  Dessert cooler located at the till and is very tempting.  Highly recommend the Macroons - all flavours are tastely and I can hardly ever resist!  I have tried the Soup Of the day - awesome.  Many other menu items on my list of things to try!  Althought there are always people, usually still able to find a table for 2.  Only negative for me has been that the shairs are uncomfortable.  Need to meet a collegue or friend for coffee - this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant part of the Teatro Group, just that alone is a guarantee for good, quality food.  I brought hubby here last week and it was my first time after their renovation.  We arrived just after 10am and it was pretty darn busy, but from waiting in line to finishing our meals, the whole process took just an hour.  Since I was craving for something savoury, their duck confit waffles appealed to me right away while hubby got the duck panini, and I also got a side of their house cured gravlax because I wanted to try it.    My meal was so good.  Waffles were fluffy, duck confit was flavorful and tender, and the creme fraiche plus blackberries just complemented everything together so well! I've never had their duck confit panini before, but after taking a bite out of my husband's it was very hard to put it down - especially with that amazing truffle aioli! He enjoyed it immensely too.  The gravlax was a generous portion and wasn't too salty but I wish it was served with the appropriate condiments.  Vendome is definitely one of those nice, somewhat upscale yet casual at the same time kind of place.  It remains as one of my favorite breakfast places.  I highly recommend anyone to give them a try."}
{"text":"Duck confit, tuna melt , Italian paninis are so delicious, and come with a little dish of slaw or potato salad. Butternut soup is one of the best, thick and creamy and full of flavour. I enjoyed the pasta dish with shortribs, it was cheesy and rich. Next time I'll try the caesar salad, which looks really good with bacon.. I wish they wouldn't sell out so much though. Good teas (Mighty Leaf) for pretty cheap, about $2.50. Keep up the great work. Only complaint is that Vendome is way to popular. Lineups are long."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. Has a nice patio and tons of seating. My wife and I went to work on our computers ($20 in patronage over a ~2.5hr stay, judge accordingly). We found out about Vandome through some list of Best Cafes to Work in. It wasn't at all good for thoughtful work. There were very few power outlets, many loud conversations by 20-somethings and some of the most sanity-piercing music I've ever heard. I'm probably just not the target demographic. They have lovely food/drinks, a cool space and basically are doing everything right, at least, for a certain crowd."}
{"text":"Vendome has opened again! I had heard many rumbles about this hidden gem but the last time I checked it was closed for renovation. So I guess I'm visiting Vendome 2.0. I heard they have crazy lines so I choose to visit it during an off time during the weekday. We ordered the Salmon Benny and The Waffles and 2 lattes. I'm a coffee snob so sometimes I will eat somewhere and go to a tried and tested place for my coffee. This combines my love of coffee and good breakfast food. The Salmon Benny was divine and cooked perfectly, the waffles was tasty too man I love that marscapone whipped cream. I'm definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Vendome is a great find in the quiet neighbourhood of Sunnyside.  A local favourite, they have a cozy atmosphere and delicious food.  I've been here a number of times, opting usually for  a coffee stop or late brunch/lunch.  The food is fantastic- paninis are always a safe bet, as are the main dishes for the extra hungry visitor.  Treat yourself to the cheese cake, its fantastic!"}
{"text":"When I'm in Calgary, I go here a lot to grab a bite to eat, do some work, and relax. Service is fine, albeit a bit slow, but the food is always excellent. The atmosphere is peaceful and airy, great for focusing on something or meeting up with friends. I went here a few weeks ago, and tested some of the new items. The new mac and cheese on the menu is particularly tasty, with a nice kick of black pepper in the sauce. I had the lemon meringue tart for dessert. The meringue was perfect, but the crust of the tart was a bit too firm. Other desserts I've had, such as the creme brulée and macarons, however, are very enjoyable. I'm not a coffee junkie, so I just drink water and can't speak to the caffeination. There are always a few minor quibbles, but by and large, my experiences here are very positive. My one note on operational proceedings from my last visit was that the restaurant closed at 8 PM, which struck me as a bit too early, especially when it has to compete with Higher Ground. Again, quibbles, but the big picture is good."}
{"text":"Cute Cafe to have a coffee date with a friend. Weird hipster vibe from the staff though. Get the impression they don't want to be there. Suggestion, smile a little and don't channel the Daria vibe too hard.  Had their carrot loaf which was pretty tasty and their coffee.   Would go again to try something else."}
{"text":"the Duck Confit andwitch and fresh salad with blucheese was amazing"}
{"text":"Vendome is reopened and it's wonderful! Missed the food here and the coffee too.   I don't know what they did but somehow it's never a big problem anymore finding tables. Perhaps because the patio is opened? Maybe they are bringing food out faster? Maybe the line up is so long that by the time you order, some people have ate and left already? I don't know what it is but at least I am not fighting over tables with people anymore and glaring at people with their laptops out with one coffee at their table.   One thing I'm sad about is they got rid of their salted caramel french toast and replaced it with bread pudding. The bread pudding is good but the french toast was better.. Please bring it back!   Also could you please change the colour of the writing on the blackboard for the menu... It's pretty but the blue is impossible to read.   The place always is lined up so go early if you don't wanna stand in line for 20min."}
{"text":"Vendome Cafe was, without question, my best dining experience in Calgary, and I'll go so far as to say it's among one of my most enjoyable dining experiences. period.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Kensington is, in and of itself, one of the coolest neighborhoods out there, so that bakes in some trendiness by default. Even so, the interior of Vendome Cafe matches the appeal in the surrounding area, and while the lines can get long, fast and friendly servers make for a comfortable experience. Seating is diverse, and the clientele ranged from young people to families seemingly returning from church. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  First up: Smoked Bacon Mac n' Cheese ($12.00): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg&select=1UEQ2w1YwAtFaTsYgGBkVQ  Second: Salted Caramel French Toast ($12.00): http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg&select=sA6rXeMQFmT-lP-H_VcF-A  Sizable portions, fair prices. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Oh... oh my. Let's throw in some context here. For the past 18 months, I've lived in Dallas, Texas, which I'm inclined to crown as royalty on the global mac n' cheese circuit. I've probably had twenty or so different varieties of mac n' cheese in Texas, and the dish I had here at Vendome gave each and every one of those twenty dishes a run for their money. This was magical. Perfectly cooked with a consistent smoked flavor throughout, the crunchy surface was a cherry on top of the best of cakes.   The french toast was fantastic as well, and the uniqueness of cutting up the bread prior to (baking?) cooking it was met nicely with the whipped cream and caramel. Delicious. Dual Stars Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Amazing. Yes. Star Granted."}
{"text":"The waffles are my favourite. I've also had the French toast as well, and the croissants and muffins. Always busy on the weekends but they manage to move things very quickly for a small venu. It is an order first at the counter, get a number, and have the food brought to you set up. It seems to work very well. Just when you think you'll have no seats because it is so busy, a table will open up. Overall, one of my favourite cafes in all of Calgary. I visit frequently."}
{"text":"Fantastic latte and very good breakfast panino. Extremely elegant interior for a small cafe. Quick service, with the latte brought when ready, then the sandwich. My only complaint would be that they used dark blue on chalkboard for some of the menu, which is hard to read. Fair walk from downtown, but very nice if you follow the riverside trails."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Loveeeeee Vendome Cafe! I think world peace would be solved if every neighbourhood had a place like this around the corner! Vendome is a hidden gem in Kensington. It's a few blocks off the main track, in an unsuspecting old corner store shop.   This place has it all: funky atmosphere, amazing menu, fun service, great selection (take away & dine in), etc etc. Really, I can't say enough great things things about this place.   The menu is sooo unique. The chef clearly put a lot of effort into making deliciously paired foods into funky fun meals. There is something for everyone here!   My only one wish is that the barrista was a tad faster, but it's well worth the wait for the yummy coffee!   Vendome, please come to my neighbourhood very very soon!!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious, the best in calgary id say. The environment is nice, its always filled with stylish hipsters and old people, I always bring girls here its such a great experience although pretty pricey for a cafe."}
{"text":"Thinking Venodome (owned by Teatros) would be too trendy for the more hippie leaning yuppy residences of Sunnyside, I was pleasantly surprised after several visits for brunch and coffee. Venodome fits right into the neighbourhood.  Venodome took over from where the Sunnyside staple cafe Heartland Cafe left off. Although Heartland had a more rustic feel it was actually not very laid back. Venodome has class, great food, and good coffee. The atmosphere is easy going and friendly.  My friend always has the breakfast classic which is simple (eggs, bacon, hash browns if i remember correctly) but it's well spiced and fairly substantial. I'm a fan of the spinach and cheese croissant--the croissant, flaky and crispy on the outside, moist and on the inside, is quality and the cheese is strong and flavourful. I despise when a sandwich is made with cheap cheese. Venodome uses quality ingredients.  It's quite busy on weekends around lunch so try getting there before or after noon. Unfortunately it is closes early everyday. What's with cafes in Calgary closing at 5 or earlier?"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Yelp reviews or I never would have found out about this location!  Incredible food, ambiance, service and patrons. 5/5 stars for every aspect of this quaint, quiet, lovely cafe with food you can taste the love in."}
{"text":"Today I went to Vendome for the first time, and I was delightfully surprised. First, they have a lot of vegetarian/pescetarian flare. Along with that, the food itself was incredibly good. I ordered the mushroom eggs benedicts which was awesome. I also had a chai tea latte. My SO enjoyed the ham eggs benedict. We really enjoyed the food.  I will definitely be heading back soon. The food was awesome. The only thing is the place is insanely busy and it can be challenging to find a table. Just something important to remember."}
{"text":"After getting my rental car, I decided to drive around Calgary looking for a place to have lunch and kill some time before returning to the airport to pick up a friend.  I had Vendome Cafe bookmarked since my last trip to Calgary and brunch food sounded amazing to me.  What a cute little cafe/coffeehouse!  Just what I needed, coffee.  You order at the counter then find a seat.  For a Friday afternoon around lunch time, there were plenty of seating.  Looking at the menu, what stood out to me was the Duck Crepe--confit duck crepes with rosemary whipped chevre, sautéed leek, carrot, and port wine cherry sauce...yes, please!  Nothing is more satisfying than confit duck with goat cheese.  Unfortunately, I was informed that they were out of the duck crepe.  I asked the server what she recommended and her answer was \"it depends on your preference\", she came off as kind of rude.  I ended up defaulting my usually, Classic Egg Benedicts. That tomato jam is what made it stand out compared to all the others I've had, the acidity/sweetness cuts through the richness of the Hollandaise sauce. Delish!  Good coffee and wi-fi, you could definitely kill time at Vendome Cafe for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. The food is always delicious.  It's a bit annoying to have jostle for a seat as you order at the counter and then they bring it you.  You can tell they use quality  ingredients as flavours and textures are always amzing.  And they serve breakfast late into the day.  You pay a bit more but it's worth it because the quality is there.  The apple caramel dessert is decandent.  I like the staff and the vibe too."}
{"text":"This place is a beaut!  Beautiful, lively atmosphere and lovely decor. There was a line-up nearly out the door, which is always a good sign!  It took a little while to get to the front of the line, but the food came out relatively quick. The duck confit panini was divine! My boyfriend had the Italian panini, and it was delicious. The sandwiches are all goodness, no wilted lettuce, no burning hot tomatoes.  The iced tea was home-brewed and über refreshing.   The cafe itself was hot, very few windows open, and a bit loud, which kinda adds to the atmosphere.  I am definitely going back for brekky, though!"}
{"text":"I heard about Vendome's reputation as one of the best brunch spots in Calgary during their renovations. When they reopened I was eager to try them out. As of this review, I have had brunch at Vendome twice. Both times, the line to order wrapped around the bar to behind the front window seats. The wait isn't too long - about 10-15 minutes. Both times I went, I ordered their gravlax salmon eggs Benedict (it was that good!) and Mighty Leaf jasmine tea. The hollandaise sauce is rich and buttery, and the portion of salmon was generous. I also loved how they changed up the traditional English muffin with toasted panini bread. My only qualm is their macarons were not fresh when I had them. They were rock hard and could not be eaten without breaking one's teeth."}
{"text":"Love, love, loved it.   After reading the reviews from my fellow helpers, I had to give this place a go. After all, I'm the type of person who can eat breakfast food for any meal of the day!   For those who don't know, Vendome is situated on a quiet street in Sunnyside. It inhabits a quaint building and is presented in a manner that combines class and coziness.  Just like their big sister, Alforno, they have a system where you pay for your order up front, then find a space to sit in their dining room. I ordered the duck confit waffle and an iced vanilla chai latte. It took slightly longer than average to arrive, but it was absolutely worth the wait. The waffle was crispy, light and well accompanied with butter, syrup, duck confit and a poached egg. Having never tried a savoury waffle before, it was delicious!  If you ever get the chance to swing by there, you have to try it out!"}
{"text":"First time visit here for brunch. Different kind of system than I'm used to where you order and pay first then you get seated. Not a fan of it to be honest, giving a tip before you get your service doesn't make any sense. Also didn't really like it when a staff member asked the people in front of us if they were eating in and size of table needed then skipped our group and asked the ppl behind us the same question.   We ordered the mushroom benny, duck confit waffles, \"French toast\" bread pudding, and lasagna. Reasonable wait time for the food but after it came to our table zero service after that until the staff wanted to clear our plates. Another reason why I don't like paying/tipping up front. Don't expect refills on coffee. Water was self serve.   The food was tasty, ambience was ok but it seemed liked there was some poor air circulation in the restaurant. It was busy so the place got hot and stuffy."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast cafe. I'm not a coffee drinker, however, I am a London Fog connoisseur.. And I am obsessed with the light taste of lavender in Vendome's version of this classic warm beverage!  When we first tried their breakfast menu, I ordered a large breakfast poutine and it was far too much for me to enjoy alongside a large London Fog. I now know better and order the half sized version of the Ham Breakfast Poutine. My partner switches it up depending on what time we go for breakfast (a few select items on the menu are not available until after 10am). I do remember trying his waffles one morning. Divine. If you're not a fan of anything sweet, I'd avoid the waffles.. But seriously.. DIVINE.  To go? Lemon Tart! And by later, I mean, as soon as I get to the car. Because I just can't let it sit that long in my lap without taking a bite. And after one bite, I need another. If you're a fan of lemon meringue - take at least 3 to go! ;)  I cannot say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"More often than not there's a wait but it's well worth it. I've been here a few times with Mini and each time was better than the last. On our most recent visit we had the breakfast poutine and the berry waffles. I wish I had ordered the full size of the poutine because it was just SO delicious.  There's really nothing to recommend because it's all good! Come with a book in case you have to wait!"}
{"text":"Now that our office is close by this has quickly become one of our favourite shops.   Whether grabbing a coffee on the way to the office, having a sweet treat break or moving a meeting from our office patio to a coffee shop this is the shop of choice. Delicious food and coffee.   Only downside is often there's no tables free. Always quite busy"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and atmosphere. Fairly large for a cafe but still very cozy. Great service and good coffee. Presentation of food is excellent and the eggs benedict is wonderfully savory. A little pricey for a cafe, but an excellent choice for a late breakfast!"}
{"text":"I am always impressed with this place. The wonderful aroma will lead you to this place if you happen to walk near by. They usually have quite the line up out the door but it's worth it. For lunch, I got my usual duck confit panini and my lunch date had the salmon benny. Half way through, we swapped dishes. Glad I could stop by this place before heading out of YYC."}
{"text":"Gets super busy, but I love that you dont have to stand and wait, they will bring the food/drinks to you. Its a funny space, one 1/2 is always much warmer than the other. We went for a mid-afternoon snack, the spinach and mushroom croissant was delightful! I had a mocha and it was so delicious. I love how friendly the atmosphere is, and I loved running into old friends in line."}
{"text":"I came here based on a rave recommendation from a friend. Perhaps I should've tried something else. I'm not an eggs Bennie person so I got the ham and cheese croissant, waffles and butternut squash soup. The croissant was okay. Waffles were tasty, though I did not care for the toppings and they were kinda rock hard. Butternut squash soup tastes like anything out of a tetra pak. When we were done we smelled of smoked meat. My hair stinks, my clothes stink. Parking is hard to find. No real special drinks are offered. Orange juice is out of a bottle. Tea is tea. Sorry, I wanted to like it, but after experiencing some other very awesome breakfast places I can't say I want to go back. :("}
{"text":"Stopped in one Friday for lunch with my boy. He had the whole wheat blueberry waffles and I enjoyed the half order of eggs benny. Everything was spot on. The baking goodness behind the counter made it difficult to decide what to eat. Everything looked and/or sounded amazing.   We enjoyed our meal, the service was good and we left with our bellies full. No line ups when we were there and we found a table right away.  Another bright spot by Kensington that we will return to."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  Stopped here for breakfast, and had an amazing meal.  The breakfast poutine is like crack, and the full order can feed 2 people easily.  The duck confit waffle was good, but stopped short of being amazing.  The duck was a little dry and underseasoned.  But I'd go back!"}
{"text":"If not the best Brunch /cafe in Calgary, definitely in the top 3.  Try the coffee and you will know what I mean!! It's located in a lovely part of Kensington and has a great outdoor patio during the summer.  Must visit !!!"}
{"text":"What's not to love? Just off of the Sunnyside train station, in a charming old brick building. The coffee flows freely and the food is outstanding, from light yogurt parfaits to decadent french toast.  There is one hinky thing though. Every time I leave Vendome there's a lingering smell in my clothes. It isn't the pleasant aroma that surrounds you when you're in the cafe, instead it's a weird-not-very-nice-sitting-in-a-hot-car-with-a-box-of-pizza smell. Vendome's awesome enough though that I go back all the time."}
{"text":"I LOVE Vendome!!!  I've been dying to try this cute little cafe ever since I heard Raissa R. talking about it. French Toast bites? I'm in! While driving in the area one day, we decided to pop in for lunch.  Initially, I thought the place looked very small, but once we saw the extra seating around the corner, we were relieved to find a free spot! We ordered beverages, and I had the Chicken Pot Pie while Josh had a breakfast dish of some sort. I fell in love with the menu - so much to choose from, and I love that they're licensed, so I'll definitely be popping in for some cheese & wine next time.  My pot pie was absolutely delicious, and Josh really enjoyed his meal as well. We couldn't finish due to the huge, gooey cinnamon bun we had first (what? we were hungry...) but I will definitely be back. It's pricey, but worth it. Love!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, seating, and decent food. A very popular spot I've been told in Calgary and I can see why. I would definitely be open to coming back. Only complaint is that it is a little pricey for what it's worth but had a good experience overall. I'd come with a small group or even by myself actually."}
{"text":"Come the place with friends. Lovely store, nice decorating, meal is good which I tried a French toast and steamer. But it's too small for it's tons of customer lo."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Vendome and  I had got the banana French toast and a latte. The wait time for food is reasonable. My toast was good and filling. My latte on the other hand was more like a cappuccino and the beans tasted like very low quality beans. They definitely need to work on there coffee. It was fairly busy yet we still were seated right after we were done ordering which was nice. I just wish the cashier gave more guidance on what happens after we order."}
{"text":"This may infect be my new favourite breakfast place in Calgary. It's located in the Kensington area which automatically makes it super trendy and the interior is adorable!   The latte we ordered was probably one of the best i've had in a while, I was actually pretty chocked that I had agreed to share some with the boyfriend... I wanted this thing all to myself, it was that good!   Our food came pretty quick, you go up to the counter and order and then they bring it right to your table. I had a half order of eggs benny which was the perfect size for me and the boyfriend had the salmon eggs benny which he said was AMAZING! I also had the luxury of ordering freshly squeezed Orange Juice, man was it good. I haven't had fresh juice is a long time!   Overall I would most definitely come back to this place. I've heard it can be a cute little place to hang out in the evenings with a glass of wine and some great live local music so I will most definitely be back to check that out!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this for a long time. French toast at Vendome. Not just French toast, but French toast for lunch... or lupper? It was 2 pm.  I've heard good things, but I wasn't quite sure what made this French toast so great. After all, some batter, some good bread-it's really not that hard. When my plate of fried bread and batter (that could make a great pun for a French toast place... \"It's our bread and batter!\" the slogan could read) showed up at the table, it was this mound of neatly sliced bread squares, lightly battered, and drizzled in syrup with delicious pockets of cream cheese and whipped cream around the edges. I expected them to be overly sweet, but they were not. Instead, each bite was a delicate balance of lightly crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. A mouthful of that dipped in a bit of the side dressings had my eyes rolling into the back of my head. It's that wonderful.  Beyond the French toast, I'm a fan of Vendome. I love the other room away from the main coffee bar. I just wish I could find room to sit in it! This is one busy little spot just off the beaten track in Kensington."}
{"text":"Vedome is basically like a second home to me. I love it here! Their drinks are beautifully done, and their salmon eggs benny is the best I've ever had. I highly recommend it. A few weeks ago I went to go get breakfast there, and was heartbroken to see that they're temporarily closed until March. I cannot wait till they open again so I can have one of their delicious Eggs Benedict's, Macrons, and Americanos!"}
{"text":"So here is my 3rd review... Still no bacon, coffee tastes like water and cost for breakfast was not what I expected! I'm digging in now!!   So verdict is waffles good, breakfast panini good, but hash browns not same as before!! So I think I am moving on!! So my second visit now, didn't feel like making breakfast so I searched and searched for best breakfast in Calgary. But I decided to give Vendome a second try, to my surprise my waffles& drench toast have changed!! I order French toast( now bread pudding) with blueberries , salted caramel , and whipped marscapone. With a side of bacon... No bacon???? Maybe they're out but that is a big no no I'm my books!! So French toast is good very filling! Coffee is okay I ordered med blend, and it is organic!!  Very retro place, Tuesday at 10am not too busy and a beautiful day to sit on patio! I'd say it's a good place for breakfast, never tried lunch or dinner! They  have live bands Thursday evenings, and serve alcohol. So give it a try, nice spot in Kensington check out across the street it is very cool!!"}
{"text":"I have only ever come here for brunch because they have awesome breakfast poutine and a vegetarian croque-monsieur (they call it the croque vert) that I love. You order at the counter, take your number and sit down, and they will bring your food out to you. They have recently expanded quite substantially and now there is a ton more seating! Don't be intimidated if the line is out the door; it moves quickly and since their renovation it's unlikely you won't find seating! Most of their food also gives you the option of choosing a full portion (if you want to pig out) or if a half portion (if you have some self restraint).  The breakfast poutine is super rich. The half portion looks small but it is very filling. The spinach version has soft potatoes drowning in hollandaise (i.e. delicious fat) and cheese curds (i.e. more fat) and spinach - so you don't have to feel bad about all that other stuff.   The croque vert is probably one of my favourite sandwiches and I've never seen another place do croque-monsieurs. Also, it's just cute to say. Croque-monsieur! The bread is super crusty and buttery and the roasted vegetables are done perfectly and everything is smothered in some kind of amazing sauce.  Their coffee is alright but the food is definitely the main draw for me. Will definitely be back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the food Vendome.  My lady and I had the blueberry waffles and the standard: eggs, toast and bacon. I also got a dirty chai latte and she got a latte with pumpkin added - tasty."}
{"text":"I used to love vendome a lot, but once they took down the french toast i really liked from the menu after the renovation, i didn't come that often.  And i was surprised the air circulation was still bad and it seemed like more flies flying around than before. I hesitated to drink the water (self serve).  I ordered tuna poke and my friend ordered a ham poutine. we both thought those were just okay. But i really like the macaroon,prefect size, sweet but not too sweet & rich flavour."}
{"text":"You must visit this quaint neighbourhood Cafe! Looking for an new place to try we found this recommended on Yelp and the reviews were dead on.  Great west sw facing patio. Old wood floors creak as you walk. Pictures of various people are fun and interesting. The display of many pastries and desert options make a return visit a must. I will try their Lemon Tarts next time. On a very busy Saturday we were served in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the Salmon Eggs Benny. Pause... Hands down the best I have ever had, and I'm 44;)  My wife had the Salted Carmel French toast and it was awesome. The bananas were a bit mushy and a side of bacon made up for the missing protein.  Fun loud atmosphere in a quaint friendly Cafe. Put it in your calendar."}
{"text":"First timer here and would go back in a heartbeat! Tasty chai latte and fresh croissant with cheese was stand out.  Slight downsides/observations where the noise level between the speakers which was fine but also a lot of kids with devices and volume on max, a little much. The wait time (25 mins) as well as some staff coming off underwhelmed/over it (unfortunate as the other staff was friendly/open)   Overall would recommend however and def return for more."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a couple of years ago, and it was so great that I came back again on my most recent visit to Calgary. Tucked away on a little side street, this hidden gem is definitely a place to try. The London Fog latte was smooth and delicious. A little small for the price, but really it was so good that I don't even mind.  I had the turkey club panini, and boy oh boy...crispy and delicious! Very simple turkey, bacon, avocado, and mayo with some cranberry aioli to dip the panini in, which was a great complement. No fancy pants stuff, and it doesn't need it. They give a nice amount of avocado too - I've eaten at places before that really chintz out, but not here. They also gave a little ramekin of macaroni salad on the side which at first I giggled at since it was tiny, but it turns out it was the perfect amount. The eggs benny was a different twist on the original and comes with a side of roasted potatoes. Instead of an English muffin and back bacon, it was focaccia and prosciutto. Yummo! I hope I will return to Calgary again so that I can come back to this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to really add anything to all of the 5-star reviews so far. It's in a neat-o locale, the coffee was good (par for the course as far as price is concerned), and, the menu is pretty great too.  I will take away a star for the sloooow service, but whatever, they're friendly.   I do like the building itself. It's sort of the thing that feels like there should be a lot more of in Calgary. Older Heritage building and all that."}
{"text":"Best eggs Benedict in Calgary! They always have new drink creations to try with my brunch.  This is my favourite breakfast spot in Calgary."}
{"text":"25 min wait and 25 open seats. The staff couldn't care less if they were hipsters debating a band they hadn't heard of. Had the eggs Benny soft...as a rock. Toast damn near broke a tooth. I'm 230lbs and left food on my plate. I can't wait to never come back :)"}
{"text":"We came here specifically to try their two YYC Hot Chocolate Festival 2018 entries - the spirited Dutch Hot Chocolate and the Salted Passion.  They were both delicious, but for me, the Salted Passion was the standout.  Also tried a breakfast sandwich that had sausage in it.  It was huge!   And delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, or maybe it's not that hidden! I came on a Saturday evening and although they were out of numerous menu items (which is a good sign because that means they have more fresh stuff!), I ordered the half open faced tuna sandwich and beet salad, it was delicious! It has a nice laid back atmosphere and seating outside on a beautiful day you escape the gentrification of Calgary and get a nice Portland like hipster vibe. I have to say the service could be improved slightly but to compensate the food and ambiance were worth it!"}
{"text":"Very.l cute brunch spot. Have been meaning to try this place for a while. A little confused when we first arrived with the ordering and lineup. So you wait in line then place your order. The seating is self seating if you can find a table. My husband waited in line and I found a table. They give you those little numbers and you place them on the table for them to bring your food and drinks. We ordered a white orchid tea, cafe latte and the full eggs Benedict. Busy place, when we left there wasn't a line so if you can wait to eat around 2pm you'll be good for a table without a wait on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Items Selected Apple Oatmeal Muffin Breakfast Poutine with Ham, Hollandaise, Quebec Cheese Curds and Hashbrowns French Toast Bread Pudding with Bananas Foster, Whipped Mascarpone, Nutella Carrot Walnut Cake with Cream Cheese Icing and Spiced Apple Cake with Salted Caramel Icing  Located in a part of Calgary known as Sunnyside, the demeanor of its mixed staff of youthful baristas and clerks fitting that name well, Vendôme Café is so-called for the building in which it is situated with a touch of flare imported from the town in Central France, an all-day sort of eatery ready to please patrons whenever they choose to stop by.  Filling two adjoining rooms with seating for perhaps sixty, the long bar, coffee counter and kitchen occupying the majority of one half with an overhead menu plus a display of pastries, it was just after 7:30am that I trekked through snow to enter the front doors, a pleasant fellow happy to offer his opinion when asked which led to a five-part order.  Taking pastries to the table while items from the kitchen were prepared by another young man, the white walls and bright lights casting off slate and wood with flowers softening the feel, it was with bites of a dense yet moist Oatmeal Muffin chock-full of Apples and Cinnamon that the meal got underway, the Carrot and Apple Cakes tasted later equally well-crafted with each featuring a good bit of added sweetness by way of their respective icings.  Covering a wider variety of menu options than one might expect based on kitchen size, each item prepared with great care and expedited speed, it was perhaps ten minutes after sitting down that two substantial plates were presented, the piping-hot porcelain filled with crispy Potatoes, squeaky Curds and creamy Hollandaise pairing well to sliced Ham while the 'French Toast' was decadence defined as day-old Bread soaked in Custard was sliced thick and presented as a leaning tower with layers separated by boozy Bananas and Nutella beneath a snowcap of fluffy Mascarpone Cream."}
{"text":"Cute Cafe!  The atmosphere was super great. The place was full but we were still able to find a table for four on a Saturday afternoon. We were able to find free parking only a block or two away which was a great thing! Love being able to go somewhere without having to worry about parking mayhem.   Loved the decor and the style. The bathrooms were super tiny but at least they were there! They had said all the food was local I believe. We had a cream filled cupcake and the caramel apple crisp. The crisp was so delightful!   Drink wise we had the drip coffee, Americano, a vanilla latte, and a cappuccino. The cappuccino was a lot stronger than expected; had a real pow! The drip coffee was locally roasted and we considered it better than average. I really liked that they had a serve yourself water station.  I'm excited to go back and try more of their food it looked so wonderful and well-plated!   We noticed a sign for live music which sounded so great!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and very good service. Poutine, panini and waffles were very delicious and hearty. Tea/coffee were well prepared and quick even during a busy time. Atmosphere was busy but felt cozy. The outside temp that day was around 19-20C: fantastic for Fall/October in YYC. Inside the temperature was a little warm even with fans going- I can't imagine what it would feel like on a hot summer day in there! Overall great dining experience. ?"}
{"text":"Probably the best French toast I have tried in Calgary and the eggs Benedict were delicious too!!... It is normally very busy.. But is sooo good, that I would wait all the time I need to, just to have those French toasts again!!.. I really liked them!.. I recommend arriving early and be patient ..."}
{"text":"Delicious salmon egg benny for breakfast! It was a nice change that it was on a panini bread versus the traditional English muffin. The salmon was delicious, thick fresh slices of pure goodness. The hollandaise sauce was also tasty. Topped with fresh delicious herbs. My partner and I shared the full order which was around $16 I believe  - great portion for sharing!   We also tried their tiramisu for breakfast. It was around $6-7. A little overpriced but it was really delicious as well. Maybe just a little bit too sweet.   The restaurant had a nice interior design. The service was great too. There's free parking on the streets outside. We will definitely come back to have breakfast/brunch again in the future."}
{"text":"Ah Vendome you had me until the very last second!  I was killing some time between jobs and stopped in here to grab a London Fog. The carrot cake looked delish so I grabbed one of those two. The woman at the cash was really friendly and I was happy to show up just at the right time when there was no line.   The drink took a few as the couple of people that arrived before me had their drinks in the works. One great thing about the barista's technique was that he got the tea bag steeping for a bit while he made some other drinks before adding the milk to my fog. Most places just throw the tea bag into the hot water and it only has time to steep while the milk is being steamed.  The one thing that kind of ruined the whole experience for me was that the barista ran some drinks out to some patrons and when he came back he ran his hand through his hair before pouring the steamed milk into my cup and handing it over. Hair and food service never mix. This isn't something that would prevent me from making another visit, it just rubs me the wrong way and makes me wonder about other food handling procedures."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Vendome? I have checked in here 9 times (and probably been here double that), so it's about time I post my thoughts.  The first time I came to Vendome I had the Salmon Eggs Benedict. Ever since then, it's been hard to try anything else. They have been nearly perfect: Every. Single. Time.  There was nothing quite as satisfying as coming here on my way home from University to enjoy a good meal and a drip coffee while reading a book. Order at the front counter and then take a seat; your food will be out shortly. If you want water, there's a table to serve yourself in the east sector of the café (it's hard to explain what it's like; sector is my best attempt).  I love that Vendome is active on Twitter (@VendomeCafe), but wish they posted a bit more. They're right next to Sunnyside station, so access by transit is no problem (notwithstanding transit issues, which is another review entirely).  If you're in the area, check out Vendome. If you're not in the area, find a way to change that, and then refer to my previous point."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch and espresso drinks, huge lines all the time including middle of the day so you know it's good! I like the pay and then be seated method which is efficient, and this may be a result of that but it's not much for service after you've gotten your food is my only complaint. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Although I keep hearing great things about their Butternut Squash Veloute I seemed to have skipped it yet again. One day I will get the soup that got away but in the meantime I finally took Nessa to try Vendome Cafe as she's been on this breakfast/brunch grind for the last little while. We tried the Breakfast Poutine with Ham, it was great except it had all the cheese enclosed in the mountain of potatoes and then needed up being too much cheese the oil from the cheese ended up breaking the hollandaise sauce while we were eating. Now I'm all for the cheese as much as the next person but as a foodie I do believe there is such a thing as too much cheese. Sadly it just made the dish too heavy. I recommend to share it with someone! Also got a half order of the Bacon Breakfast Panini. Deeeeeelicious! Bread was soft yet crispy and buttery (focaccia?). Just the right amount of white cheddar that glued it all together. It wasn't too strong so it was perfect in the panini. The egg patty had some kind of herb in it which complimented the her bed bread the was it's enclosure. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, I wanna say tarragon but I'm sure I'm wrong. Either way, it was subtle and inviting... To put more sandwich in my mouth. Lol  The panini was just a great balance and the beginning of our wonderful meal. Maybe it was the weather cause it was also beautiful outside! My better half had the Salmon Benedict. We both agreed that it was very well constructed, definitely some TLC given to the making of these open faced mounds of glory. Served with their own \"Vendome Hash\", which are chunky hash brown potatoes sautéed with some fried/caramelized onions and sweet bell peppers. Aside: I might add that the Poutines are also made from the Vendome hash. Back to the superstar of this dish, the benny! From the bottom to the top, with a generous helping of hollandaise, the salmon Benedict was amazingly balanced. It wasn't heavy but decadent, definitely not soggy but full of texture. The bottom of the bread had a crisp to it that was a perfect accomplice to the soft, buttery and rich egg on the top. The salmon was a good cut, nice and fatty that just melted in the mouth. There was still a bit of texture to the salmon as well which definitely stood out as a perfect \"in between\" of the two textures on the top and bottom.   The service was good, as always. Quick as well but just be aware when dining that Vendome is setup to be very much cafeteria-style. So you don't typically have your attentive servers in this environment. Don't get me wrong there are servers but it's all DIY. You walk in and order at the front counter, either dine in or take out. Drinks, desserts and your mains all done up front. If you've chosen to dine in you take your number to a table and the servers tending the floor find your table and serve you. Water and various other dine in items (cream, sugar, napkins to name a few) are available on a self-serve basis. If you aren't sure what/where something is the staff are very friendly and are pretty good at helping making a decision, just be mindful of the trove of people behind you as it does get busy during lunch and weekends. From my experience there is only one to two people taking orders at a time, one register, and you don't want to be \"that guy/girl\" holding up the line. Best to do your research or come hungry with a craving ahead of time.   Thanks for reading!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Tasty waffles but uninspiring compote. Benedict not available before 9 then limited after that. music system boomy. Lots to like but a lot of small annoyances"}
{"text":"I LOVE the atmosphere of this little place. Bright modern decor & the food is fantastic. Very tasty and homemade tasting dishes with fresh ingredients.   Live music many Thursday nights for a $5 cover. Well worth the night out as they get some wonderful acoustic shows. The only thing is that you need to arrive early for these as only one portion of the restaurant has a good view of area where they set up.The other seating area is around the corner near the front entrance which makes it difficult to enjoy the show if not seated on the main area as we couldnt even really hear much of it over there to even enjoy at a distance. But overall I love this place!"}
{"text":"Nice brunch place in kensington area. I really like the decor of the place, it is quite open and well lit with outdoor space.  The line up wasn't bad when we went and I wanted to try everything on the menu. We settled on the salted caramel french toast, waffles and eggs benedict. Everything was good and the portions are quite large. I think I only got through half of the french toast before I started to feel way too full but it was still worth it."}
{"text":"Cute cafe situated in in the hip Kensington area. Cozy and modern on the inside and while it seems small when you get in, there is another side of the cafe just around the corner. Like any old cafe, it's self-seating and you order from from the till and are given a number. It wasn't too busy on a Friday afternoon and while there was spots on the bar, we waited a few minutes and some tables became available. I love the marble countertops and fresh flowers that are at every table.   They have a selection of pastries, coffee and, of course, a pretty good menu to choose from. I was particularly peck-ish that morning and got half of the turkey brie sandwich as well as the butternut squash soup and side salad. For it being only half a sandwich, it was a pretty decent size! It came with a cherry jam and trust me a little goes a long way. The sandwich itself was alright but it was obvious that it was prepared much earlier in the day. The butternut squash soup was delicious and I could've definitely eaten more of it and the piece of focaccia bread it came with was soft and perfectly toasted. The mixed green salad was standard and had a touch too much dressing, but overall it was fine. My girlfriend got the croque monsieur and butternut squash soup and she also agreed that the soup was delicious.   I love the ambiance of the place and seeing people either catching up with work or catching up with friends. The staff are incredibly friendly and efficient and I can definitely see myself returning in the future to grab some coffee and try out some of their tantalizing treats next time (um hello nutella croissant)!"}
{"text":"My favourite almond milk chai latte in town!  I could say more...but why? Why mention the quaint atmosphere, fantastic service and plentiful street parking?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals in Calgary! I love this café! Super sweet baristas. I got the soup of the day (spicy sausage & eggplant, comes with side butter toast), which was perfect. We also got the breakfast poutine with ham (simply amazing), and the classic eggs benedict. All delicious!  For drinks, the chai latte was incredible. Smooth, rich and not overwhelmingly sweet! The coffee is good, but try the lattes. Finished our meal with a tiramisu, which was good but probably best if shared."}
{"text":"I've gone to Vendome for a lunch a couple of times on the recommendation of my man John Gilchrist. He describes it as a popular place for the \"stroller brigade\" and he's not kidding. Yoga moms galore! Both times I've gone, it's been totally full, despite being on a quiet corner in Sunnyside. A good sign. The inside is tastefully decorated with nice artwork.   At Vendome, you order at the counter and then they give you a number to place on your table. They have a collection of delicious paninis and more hearty fare like short rib pasta. The first time I went was during \"Svensanity\" when Sven Baertschi was making his big-league debut with the Flames last year. My friend was happy that we could temporarily christen it \"Svendome\". On this occasion, I had the short rib pasta, and every morsel was magical.  The most recent time, I ordered a Chicken Club House panini but they were out so I settled for The Italian panini. It was delicious, and accompanied by a mouthwatering mayo/dijon mustard dipping sauce. My wife has the Spicy Tuna Melt, which came with some sort of fruity dipping sauce (strawberry?). Sounds strange, but the flavours were a perfect match and it was fantastic. She also had a fruit salid, which had a vanilla honey coating that was very yummy.  This is the place to go for a delicious latte, for an iced Americano on a hot summer day. Here's hoping that next year Sven can keep the Flames hot, and the yoga moms can keep (S)Vendome hot."}
