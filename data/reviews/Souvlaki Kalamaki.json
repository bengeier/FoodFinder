{"text":"Food here is great! So glad this place is finally open. I had the Chicken Kalamaki. You have to order tahziki on the side; it doesn't come with the combo meal which I found odd."}
{"text":"Have been passing by this store since before they've opened and was excited to get authentic gyros in the neighborhood. I got the chicken gyro wrap and was not disappointed. Portion sizes are huge especially for the price. Food is delicious and very satisfying. The owner and staff are extremely friendly and really make the experience. The tzatzeki sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! 

My work team stopped in for a quick lunch today and we were not disappointed. You get salad, fries, pita, and chicken with delicious sauces for a great price. The plate was huge! We had a lot of extra food! The staff are super friendly and the restaurant has such a great atmosphere. 10/10 am coming back!"}
