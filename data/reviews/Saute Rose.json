{"text":"My fiancé and I were walking around the area on a trip to Toronto recently, and, getting hungry, decided to stop here for lunch. We both love pasta so we figured we'd try it. We split an order of tortellini with rosé sauce and it was bland. We still ate it but we definitely weren't too impressed."}
{"text":"BEST Italian food ever!!! Love their marinara sauce, I always ask for extra and guess what they don't charge extra for it"}
{"text":"I don't normally write for small fast food places like this, but this place is just exceptional. Great food for very decent prices. 

I've been coming here since my university days and  although the prices have gone up (like everything else, everywhere), the portion sizes remain very generous and quality has not suffered. The owner has always been polite and friendly and service is always quick, even with a line up. 

My favourite is the \"create your own\" where you get to pick your own sauce, pasta shape, and toppings. The take out portion is in one of those big black plastic containers and is usually enough for 2 meals for a small person like me, and all for a pretty reasonable price of about $12 (for 2 meat toppings and a veggie topping). They have other items on the menu like risotto (not bad at all!), pizza, and salad I think? 

I really recommend it if you are around and looking for a quick but hearty meal. It may not be truly authentic Italian, nor is it mind blowing cuisine, but it's really darn tasty!"}
