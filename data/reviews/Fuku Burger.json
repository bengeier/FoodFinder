{"text":"We went here very late and very close to closing after a show at the MGM. We were staying across the street and this was just what the doctor ordered in the middle of the night after imbibing in lots of beer and dancing. The staff are super friendly and the food is an array of super fun flavors and toppings. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is really good, the hamburger patty melted away with each bite. I got the spicy burger but I substituted the cucumbers for mushrooms which was no problem. I got the Jazz fries with it and the sauce compliments it well. This is a new Las Vegas staple for me when I come into town. The restaurant is in the back of the Hawaiian shopping plaza. Can't really see it from the strip with parking in the back"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here forget about in and out this is real flavor great service and very clean"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I thought fusion meant you take the best of 2 cuisines and the flavors complement each other not overpower.  I couldn't taste the burger part due to the overwhelming use of sauce.  The 2 stars is only for the fries with gravy and \"crack\" sauce which was good but not amazing.  There are plenty of other burgers on the strip worth trying first."}
{"text":"Great Japanese style burgers, with a smiley service. We had the awesome spicy burger with home made jalape√±o sauce and a delicious and generous katzu chicken burger! Not a tourist trap!"}
{"text":"A chance encounter led to an unbelievable eating experience. Fuku burger creates burgers with a Japanese twist. I got a #2 beef burger with teriyaki, wasabi mayo and finished/ crispy onion strings and a fried egg. My wife had a #3 beef burger/ apple bacon, pickled red onions, red ginger, Japanese BBQ sauce and wasabi mayo. Also love the fries. Great way to mix cultural foods. Collin is a unique guy and told us about the food truck experience that led to this hole-in-the-wall restaurant. ENJOY."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I finally tried this place out last night.

Every time I went to first Friday I always wanted to try the fuku burger truck just never got a chance to. 

The actual restaurant is located in the Hawaiian Market place on the Las Vegas  strip. I usually avoid the strip while living in las Vegas because I like to avoid drunk obnoxious tourists lol. 

When we arrived the cashier was very friendly asked us if we had questions etc. The menu is simple but very detailed. 

I got the #4 kinoko (mushroom burger).  I was kind of weary of the pickled red ginger. I love the stuff but just on rice lol. I was actually amazed at how well the ginger complimented the grilled shitake mushrooms. 

My girlfriend got #2 Tamago (egg) burger she said it was amazing. 

There are two different types of fries one has a sauce and the other just seasoning. Both were great the dried fries was better. The one with the sauce was great in taste but really salty.

If you tip they give you Asian jelly stuff in a tube lol  the guys were really nice they tolerated my girlfriends obsession with ketchup lol

Overall I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"I must say that I am very impressed with the deliciousness of the food and the extreme friendliness of the staff. My wife and I got two burgers and an order of fries for carryout today for lunch (7-23-2015). She ordered the mushroom burger and I got the spicy burger (I forget the clever Japanese names). Both burgers were absolutely bursting with flavor and the burgers had a really good crunch that must have been the perfect sear. I thought the flavors were excellent and the value for the meal was great.

We have had Bobby's Burger Palace and Bachi Burger during this visit to Las Vegas. I find both the other places to be very good, but I must say that Fukuburger will be a place we will return to for each visit to Las Vegas due to the VERY friendly staff and the absolutely delicious burgers. They can hold their own against these other hipster burger places and I wish that had a place like this in socal! Great job Fuku Burger on ALL accounts!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and the fries with crack sauce are out of this world.  If you are looking for reasonably priced burgers on the strip this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We are Vegas local and have been a Fuku fans since they serve out of that burger truck. This is just the worst experience ever because of the poor customer service at this new location. Their operating hours on yelp listed to be closed at midnight on a Saturday night. We got there at 11:20 and they told us they are already done for the day. I mentioned to them the operating hours on yelp, but the guy just did not care at all. During the whole conversation, he stayed in the kitchen and just yelled to us that they are done for the day without any further explanation or an apology. I work in the industry myself and I totally think that the situation would be way better with a simple apology and better attitude. Is this the level of guest service we are providing to our Vegas tourists? 

Again, this is only a review regarding the service, not the FOOD!"}
{"text":"I had a #4 today and it is my go-to burger place on the strip when I want something but don't have the money for a high price place. Jimmy makes it the best by far and Bri was a total sweetheart at the register. I love the nicknames they give you!!"}
{"text":"My husband loves him some Fuku Burger. We first discovered it when a friend brought us to a food truck festival in Vegas about 8 years ago. We are from SD and always tried to catch their food truck when we were in Vegas. We've gone to their Hollywood location a few times before it closed down (boo hoo). 

We stopped by this location on our way out of Vegas for lunch. Service was top notch- guys at the counter were friendly and quick to greet. We asked for some extras and they brought them right out to us. We ordered two Tamago burgers and jazz fries. We ordered our burgers medium but they came out well done. My husband was slightly disappointed his egg wasn't runny and burger was well done. It wasn't the drippy, juicy mess he's used to from Fuku. But it sure didn't stop him from eating the whole thing. Jazz fries were delicious as usual. 

Parking was free in the lot once we mentioned we were going to Fuku Burger. It wasn't crowded on a Sunday afternoon. We paid $22 for everything which is a steal on the strip. I'm sure we will be back next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and fastly prepared. Our server was probably the most friendly and helpful person we've encountered in Vegas. Answered all our newbie questions. Tons of fun! Music may be a bit loud outside."}
{"text":"This place is awesome . First time ever having fukuburger . My husband ordered the #5 spicy burger and I order the #6 crispy chicken which by the way is bigger than the bun . Also used a groupon coupon which made it a better deal . Defiantly will be coming back."}
{"text":"Had gotten there at 1am and they were closed despite Yelp saying they were open till 2:30am"}
{"text":"I read all the hype about Fuku Burger and was really excited to try this place out on my Vegas trip. Maybe my expectations were really high, but the burgers were good but did not wow me. And I don't think that that I would go out of my way to grab a burger here again.

I had the buta burger and my other half had the kinoko burger. We asked for the burgers to be cooked medium and medium rare but the burgers came out well done. But that's alright, over cooked is better that under cooked. I also heard other customers complaining that their burgers were also well done. I also had the jazz fries which I thought were nothing special, but tasty. Brown gravy and mayo makes everything good, (thinking loco moco), I'm from Hawaii but grew up in Japan and know these combinations really well, is the owner from Hawaii, or have local connections? Flavors seem kind of \"Hawaiish\" or local kine with a Japan twist. Also, just to throw it out there I had a lychee slurpee that was 12 bucks without any alcohol in it. That's almost how much Fat Tuesday charges with  alcohol in it. I thought that was a little bit expensive. I did have them add a tequila shot which was 2 bucks extra after finding out there was no alcohol in it which I thought was reasonable. 

 IMHO  I think I might of went on a off day and would like to try Fuku Burger again, I especially like the burger wrappers with all the cool stuff written on them. I can read Japanese and thought it was funny and creative thinking as hell, only if you all can all read the s**t that is written on the burger wrappers LOL :). Oh and I think the burgers and fries are a great deal but the slush or slurpees are over priced, Oh well, it's Vegas."}
{"text":"Hung out at Fuku on Saturday and Sunday talked with Colin he's cool guy....BEST BURGER HANDS DOWN...never mad it to Fatburger,  and don't care....Fuku BURGER  with those amazing fries...loved it...from ur TX buds...."}
{"text":"We parked at the wrong lot & had to pay $5 for parking! 
The frys were fresh, delicious & plentiful.  Our two burgers however were disappointing.  Both had a strange taste which I hope was some kind of seasoning and not \"on the verge of spoiling\" beef.  There are so many great burger places (like Fatburger) just 1 block away, that I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Burger was a bit messy but everything else was spot on. Great meat, buns and texture. Very unique flavouring and ingredients. I can understand why it beat Gordon Ramsay's burger for best in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I rarely eat fast food nowadays, but if I were to choose one place to eat. It'd be Fuku Burger at this location. I've never eaten so much Fuku Burger in the span of two months. I usually get the Tamago Burger (Egg Burger). The egg was unbroken and the crispy onion strings were marvelous. Each time always gets better. But my last one was the best. Complements to the chef, Matt or \"Trill,\" whom also built the burger. I'll be returning here soon."}
{"text":"We got the Buta burger and Tamago burger and split them so we could try both. They were unbelievably good. Same with the Jazz Fries. Amazing food. Customer service was great too. I love the interior, including the Kazushi Sakuraba figure!"}
{"text":"Burgers were good. We had the tamago, Buta, and the katsu burger. Buta burger had a blast of flavor. Honestly, I couldn't really taste the tamago after having the Buta. The katsu was exactly like donkatsu but on a burger. My kids liked it. Jazz fries were great. Never had anything like it before. Staff was so friendly. Parking was $5 in the lot closest to the Hawaiian Marketplace but if you show them your receipt they reimburse you. Great tip from a Yelp review."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers on the strip. I had this the day I checked in and I wasn't disappointed. I loved the Asian flare. The ginger made it. The fries were great but didn't stand out. The burger did. I totally would go back in a heartbeat. I loved the location, the staff, and the food!"}
{"text":"I am all about the holes in the wall and excellent flavor. This place is that exactly. On the strip so walking distance if you are looking to escape the casinos its in a strip mall winning a game of hide and seek. When you walk in, don't focus on how it's rather unkempt and a bit dirty, the menu is excellent, I wanted to try everything. I had the spicy burger. Delicious! The fries were good but they give you a itty container of ketchup that may be homemade, it was very good. So you may want to ask for extra. 

Food: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Venue: 2/5"}
{"text":"Went there with my family. Little bit small but big enough for 7 or 8 tables. Cashier was friendly. You order your burger, go sit, and then wait until they call your name. The burgers and fries were good. When I was looking at the menu, I only saw about 10 items or so on the it. Would give them 5 Star if they had more options. Hopefully they'll have more items on their menus later. The price was reasonable. $48 for 4 burgers, 2 fries, and 3 drinks. Overall, this is a good place to get some different kind of burger twist/fusion. I would go again."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find this burger place! It was a Friday night at like 8pm and the place was empty- it looked kinda sketchy too, not gonna lie. 

The menu is simple and straight forward. Service was fast. I had the spicy burger and it was deliciously juicy! The beef was rich and the sauces they used were amazing. I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Last time I ate at Fuku Burger it was at the LINQ. It was a great location in the center of everything. My favorite part was the drummers they had outside. Since then they have moved. Last time I ate there I got the fuku burger and a bubble tea. The atmosphere is great, however I'm just not a fan of the fukuburger and only ate about 1/4 of it. The bubble tea was good, but it was overpriced and took forever to make. But I have since been updated that this isn't part of the actual fuku burger. Other than that I don't have many other complaints. It is either your type of place or it's not. The fuku burger is reasonably priced with a decent selection to choose from.Last time I ate at Fuku Burger it was at the LINQ. It was a great location in the center of everything. My favorite part was the drummers they had outside. Since then they have moved. Give it a try if you want something new!"}
{"text":"First of all, parking is $5 at the lot for Hawaiian Marketplace which is not the fault of Fuku (pronounced foo koo BTW).  The burgers are reasonably priced at $7.99 which kinda made up for this little inconvenience of dodging pedestrians who want a death wish ignoring any safety precautions.  There is parking validation so be sure to ask for it!

Hubs and I shared a Tamago burger where the patty could have been bigger and the bread was a tad dry.  Does not come with fries but you can get one order and share it. Flavors were good though.  We got the fries with gravy and crack sauce.  I was guessing the crack sauce is mayo with somethin' spicy like Rooster.   I was close!  I like the size of the fries, not too skinny and not quite steak fries.  Crispy on the outside in order to hold up to the sauces and not get too soggy. 

We showed up late afternoon after the mad lunch rush, so no waiting for us and plenty of seating.  The place has a fun casual vibe with interesting anime type of art on the walls.   It's also fun that you can give them a crazy name and they'll call it out. They guys who work here are friendly and laid back.     

This is a fun place with a bar up front.  I can imagine the vibe would be fun and different at night.   So if you're in the vicinity of Hawaiian Marketplace, recharge yourself from all that walking and try these burgers.  They're really good.  Also, from the other reviews and the response from management, it seems as though he really does care about feedback and customer service.  I would recommend trying these burgers."}
{"text":"So my husband and I have been wanting to try this place since we first heard about them and their food truck. I will have to say i am glad i bought a groupon because it was not worth the money. We have defiantly had better! I had the chicken katsui sandwich and it was so over cooked! i couldn't even eat the last few bites in fear of breaking my teeth! My husband ordered the Fuku Burger, he said it was good but he has had better. The best thing we ate was the fries and the crack sauce. The customer service was ok, and the place was clean so those are pluses. We were just disappointed because of all the rave we heard about this place to be let down by just ok, and over cooked food. I am not sure how they were selected as one of the top burger places in Vegas i just don't see it, i would take a 5 guys burger or in n out burger over these sandwiches any day!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken katsu sandwich and it was drenched in grease. The chicken was super greasy. I'm only giving a 2 star because I liked the sauce & the fries...utterly disappointed. However my husband enjoyed his burger."}
{"text":"Probably some of the most flavorful burgers and fries I've ever tried. My son and I both had the Tamago burger with bacon. It is an explosion of flavors. The Jazz fries have the best tasting gravy I've tasted in a long time. The best part is the price!! The burgers are all $7.99 each!! That is unreal for burgers on the strip!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend. The service outside at the bar was sketchy. So we proceeded inside where the young man at the register was more than accommodating. I had the garlic fries with extra crack sauce and the barbecue bacon burger medium. My burger was cooked perfectly, when I bit into it it was heaven. The bacon was crisp the barbecue sauce was a tad bit heavy but nonetheless the burger was delish. The garlic fries were okay as was the crack sauce. Would recommend this place based on the burger alone."}
{"text":"Went here for late dinner with friends and I ordered the tamago burger with jazz fries!! I thought I had died and gone to heaven!! Absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We used to have one in LA. Please come back to socal. The food is great. the texture and flavors all come together. Ordered the tamago burger and katsu burger with jazz fries. The staff are educated and passionate about the food and experience. Keep up the great work. To marcus who was absolutely the best guy behind the counter. Personable, friendly, and genius burger maker."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant the food is always great and the service is awesome, I also like playing the board games they have here . Really nice experience."}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE burger joints in Las Vegas!!!! It comes super close to Bachi Burger, and I still need to try Holsteins. But omg if you want an amazing flavorful burger with so much NOM come to Fuku Burger!! I freaking love it. It's super tender and juicy and the sauces are amazing. If you're a sauce person like me this is the place to go. Im just knocking a star down because I wish they had a different location other than this one at the Hawaiian Market place, or their food trucks. It gets difficult tracking down the food truck sometimes and this restaurant location doesn't have easy parking.. I followed some tips to park in the parking lot behind it but the dude wouldn't let me unless I paid $10 -_- which blows. So, my BF and I ended up parking all the way at Planet Hollywood and just walked over, which was quite a walk :O hopefully they figure out a better way with parking for the locals. But if you're on the strip already, I definitely recommend to come and try them out!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little permanent installment of a popular food truck in Vegas. The quality of the meat was awesome with the right amount of fat content to give it the flavor. 

Asian fusion burgers with fun ingredients. I had the mushroom burger and would defiantly recommend it. The fries were unique and crispy with nice seasoning. I loved the banana ketchup it was like a fruity fry sauce. 

I'm glad I made the walk to enjoy a quite and delicious burger. If your thinking of a burger in Vegas don't waste your money and time going to one of the trendy spots at the casinos, go to Fuku."}
{"text":"Was just browsing on Yelp for some affordable eatery and saw Fuku. We decided to pay a visit and it definitely reached our expectation. The burgers looked fulfilling-ly appetizing. I ordered a Tamago with some jazz fries. The dripping yolk in Tamago is the ish. Then the cute cashier suggested adding Sriracha to the burger... and my goodness. You have to eat the jazz fries quicklythough; otherwise they'd get soggy. Cute cashier and good food? No complaints here."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers in town, hands down. I've been eating at Fuku since 2010, back when you had to track the truck to find them. I'd gladly do that all over again, but I was super stoked when I found out they had a physical location. The Tamago burger is a MUST HAVE. Thanks Fuku, you rock, never change."}
{"text":"Used to be you had to be lucky enough to catch the food truck to get this delishishness!  They popped up on Groupon so we went there for dinner last night.  

My friend and I both had the Tomago, which is their yummy burger topped with a fried egg make sure you ask them to fry it hard if you don't want it clucking) and fried onions.  We split a fry because the burgers are huge.  Not sure what all is in their crack sauce but it makes the fries even more amazing.  They should bottle it.  

The restaurant has a prime location at Hawaiian marketplace.. Right on the corner.  Next to Chili's. Didn't seem very busy.  Children must eat in a roped off area away from the outdoor bar and may not dine inside.   Shouldn't be brining your kids to Vegas anyway.  But that's none of my business tough.   

Would have given five stars but there is no restroom.  Restrooms are important. Especially when you have a bar. 

Oh. If you park, the nearest lot is $5.  Either that, or some smart, enterprising dude is sitting out there in a vest, getting his hustle on.


**Apparently, I was wrong about the restrooms.  I seem to recall the common restroom from years ago but thought maybe I was remembering incorrectly.  I'm so sorry!  I thought I saw a sign on the door that said no kiddos!  I stand by my belief that they shouldn't be here though :).  Thank you, Colin, for the clarifications Definitely will return!!!**"}
{"text":"Not only reasonably priced for anything on the strip, but the burger was one of the most flavorful I've had. Period! They clearly season the meat/make their own, doesn't taste like a plain burger; you could get it without sauce and be happy.  

The staff is super friendly, very attentive, and I like how they ask for a creative name for your order. (Think of things you'd like yelled several times, have fun!)

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was  a fan when they were just a food truck and im even more of a fan now. This location is great for them, its spacious, booth or table seating. You order at the counter and pay and then they ask for a silly nick name for your order. I got the #2 burger \"egg burger\". Ive never tasted anything like it, The crispy onions and eggs are what made the burger unique and delicious all at once! I got the jazz fries, Personally i LOVE them, my bf on the other hand thought the sauce was a bit too sweet. The service is great too, cashier was friendly and made suggestions on what to order when we asked. If your looking for something quick and easy at the strip there is no better place to go! Maybe just a delicious burger, still the way to go (:"}
{"text":"Tried their tamago \"egg\" burger it was very good and the fries too! Love the service and staff were fast and friendly. The theme is very creative and animated. The location is a bit of walk from their old location which was surprising to me."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!

For a burger place located on the Strip, with the addition of toppings included in the price, Fukuburger is a solid burger at a very reasonable price. Each burger is $7.99. They have five, and also one chicken sandwich also priced at $7.99.

The fries are on the pricey side though, at $3.99 for plain with dipping sauces, and $4.99 for the Jazz fries with all the fixings.

They also offer a loco moco style burger $7.99 and a Naga dog for $8.99, though these don't seem to be the main draw here.

We tried the #3 Buta (bacon) and #4 Kinoko (shiitake). I was afraid the teriyaki sauce was going to be too sweet like so many Americanized Japanese places, but they used a more authentic tasting sauce that is more salty than sweet, though you can definitely taste the sugar. The Kinoko had a tad too much sauce which made the bottom bun soggy. But I really loved the buns. Very soft and fluffy with an almost smooth yet slightly sticky feel on the outside. If you're familiar with Asian bakery rolls, this was very similar. And the buns were toasted nicely on the inside for some nice light crunch.

Both burgers were good. I preferred the mushroom, however bf preferred the bacon. Next time we will try the tamago. Another person in our party tried the #5 karai (spicy) and he said it had a decent kick to it.

Staff was very courteous and orders came out quick.

They do ask you to give them a funny or fake name for your order though. Have fun with it and don't be uptight.

Only minus is you have to go outside to the Indian buffet's building to use the bathroom. They don't have their own. These burgers are messy so you will need to wash your hands afterwards. The bathroom is in serious need of an update.

Oh yeah, easy parking at Hawaiian Marketplace lot. Just tell the attendant you are going to eat at Fukuburger and he won't charge you $5 to park there. You get two hours free. Just show your receipt when you leave. Just make sure not to toss your receipt!"}
{"text":"The chicken Katsu burger is a personal favorite! I drag all my friends along with me whenever I'm craving fuku and with their New Location on Jones, the easy access to this delicious burger joint makes me want it more!! Definitely a must have"}
{"text":"Omg this place is so freaking amazing . Like I went for round 2. Orgasmic . It's a must try after the club. No regrets guaranteed! !!"}
{"text":"This place may as well be called F-U burger because that's the way they'll treat you as a paying customer. They have no regard for their customers and will call you disrespectful and offensive  names just because you don't like their food/business and/or don't give them a 4 or 5 star review. Even if this wasn't the case, there's no way this place deserves 4 or 5 stars anyways and here's why:

First off, the tables are super dirty. There was no clean table in sight...you have all these employees but not one can take the time to wipe down tables every once in a while? I've worked in the fast food industry for many years and this would've never happened at any establishment I've been affiliated with. Our group had to clean off tables ourselves to just be able to sit and eat. 

The burgers are greasy and juicy, which isn't a bad thing but they do not have a restroom or sink for customers to wash their hands at after. This is ridiculous. What kind of place doesn't have facilities for paying customers? Especially a restaurant? I can't imagine the employees have to leave the store just to use the restroom so there is no excuse for not having a facility for paying customers to use. 

Their prices are also pretty steep for a hole in the wall walk up burger fast food joint. If you get a burger, fries and a soda for 1 person, it'll set you back somewhere in the mid teens. Sure the burgers and food are decent but what is this Gordon Ramsay's? If you're going to charge these prices, at least have a cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing location, like other similarly priced casual dining spots on the strip

Never have I been so offended with a food establishment in Vegas and I will no longer do business with them in the future. What a shame because the food was pretty decent. My visit on 6/4/15 will be my last."}
{"text":"Fuku opened up a restaurant joint here at Hawaiian marketplace and i am so glad they did! No more chasing the truck around town to get my fix. Their burgers are always delicious, juicy and very tasteful. Whatever you've read, heard of seen about this place is definitely true! It's the spot to eat, chill, have a drink or two with friends. Even though it's on the strip it's extremely easy to get to. Parking is very close and safe. 
Love the place and the customer service is no doubt top notch!"}
{"text":"The egg burger is DELICIOUS!! Got a great deal on groupon so we decided to try it out. It was soooo good! Will definitely be going back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Went there at 10:30pm on a Tuesday and had chicken Katsu burger, spicy burger, and fries. Had a groupon for $20 which covered entire meal. They also had 2 for 1 beer special which I chose to partake in. Overall very good play on hamburgers with and Asian twist. Would highly recommend to at least try once."}
{"text":"We are big fans of fuku burger and have eaten at the truck many times , the restaurant was still good but I have to say that the place felt dirty and just off if that makes sense , the staff is super nice and all but the whole experience wasn't all that great . The food is very tasty , me and daughter had the Tamago#2 , so messy and delicious , my son , we call him beast , had the chicken Katsua, Tamago, and the jazz fries. I thought the fries were good but would get them just plain without the gravy next time and just dip in the Crack sauce.  Next time I'm going to try the fukumoco#!"}
{"text":"Came in to fuku burger today with high hopes and they were highly met. I've only had a burger from their truck once before at foodie fest and I have to say it was pretty amazing. 
Today I ordered the tamago (egg) burger 
And I have to say everything flowed together perfectly 
The egg was perfect not too crispy and the crispy onions with teriyaki sauce was just absolutely on the spot 

The staff was friendly, the environment was very artistic, music brought a smile to my face due to all the oldies. 

Overall my experience was awesome and I will definitely be coming back to either the restaurant or the truck."}
{"text":"Great burgers on the strip! Very reasonable and extremely satisfying. Burgers are perfectly sized.Inside or outside seating. Friendly staff. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Where the new Fuku burger disappoints me is their prices.

Inflation inflation inflation

That's usually the theme of restaurants near the strip, which is why I usually avoid that area like the plague. So when they opened another Fuku near china town off of jones and spring mountain (previously the location of where white rabbit was) I was hoping they'd be a little softer on pricing.

Don't get me wrong, Fuku is good, just not worth $14 for a meal, or $9 for a burger good. When I think fast food, I think cheaper. I can get a full meal at in-n-out for half the price. 

But the pros to Fuku is the fun and flavor of the place. Parking is relatively easy, and you can't help but love the idea of having a funny name for your order be called out. Seriously, I much rather pick up an order with pride at the name of \"scrotes-mcballstein\" than just plain ol' customer number 76..

Their tomago egg burger is really simple but full of flavor, its a must here and it's the only reason I suffer the consequences of $9 a burger.. Their buns are also pretty soft and fluffy to bite into compared to most burger places.

Fuku is fun place to grab a snack if you don't mind paying a little extra for fast food, but when I think fast food, they're usually the last option I think of. Maybe if they didn't fall into the escalated price game, I'd consider giving them a better score."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice months apart and I see there are a lot of good reviews so someone obviously likes these burgers but not me. 

There is way way waaaay too much seasoning for my personal tastes. It wasn't natural. I like flavor but this is something else altogether. 

Also I have a problem with the ground floor eating area. For such a wet eating experience, I don't want curious tourists gawking at my messy face. No no no!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries when you're in Vegas and on a budget. Burgers are well seasoned and cooked to desired rare level. Garlic fries are crisp and the seasoning is good, the crack sauce that comes with is a great addition. Also, bonus is that they play great old school hip-pop and rap to go with your dining experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go here after finding their groupon. Plus we were looking for someplace unique since we are vacation. What a great little place right off the strip. The staff was fun and friendly. I ordered the tomato burger (fried egg) and my husband got the buta burger. We also got the garlic fries with the banana ketchup sauce. Sooooo yummy! This place was not a disappointment and exceeded all of our expectations."}
{"text":"A great burger while I was in Vegas and looking for a cheap and quick lunch. The flavors are packed in and the staff are friendly. However the burgers are a little salty for my liking."}
{"text":"Fukuburger has been a local favorite since the inception of their food truck. I can't help but be thrilled that they have opened this location. I hope it works out as their burgers are amazing. Whether you are a tourist roaming the strip for good eats or a local in search of something delicious, Fukuburger can fill that void. The Tamago is a classic favorite with a perfectly runny egg and fried onion strings. Burgers are perfectly cooked with the perfect balance of Asian fusion. I recommend trying each of their burgers if you are visiting more than once. They have flavor profiles that will satisfy whatever you're in the mood for. Spicy, pickled, classic, amazing! 

Another must try is their crack sauce either with garlic fries or crack fries. Don't forget to tip, as they do have tip jelly!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good-- I ordered the mushroom burger. I was disappointed however that they advertise banana ketchup with their garlic fries and they didn't have it (I even asked before ordering to make sure). It was a little thing, but the staff didn't seem aware of it which led to a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Best Burgers in Vegas! My husband and I had the Tamago Burger and Buta  Burger. What can I say it was DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously great burgers and fries! I highly recommend hitting this spot if you love burgers. Such a interesting twist on burger fare with Asian influence!"}
{"text":"I remember those late night food craze when Fuku Burger was still in food truck form, parked somewhere on Spring Mtn Rd. in Chinatown. Now look at them...they got themselves in a restaurant  building. \"Started from the bottom now we're here.\" =) Congrats!

Their burgers are still just as good as when they had their food truck. I always get their #2. Tamago \"egg\" burger. I make sure it's well done every time and they always cook it to my liking. My boyfriend got the #3. Buta \"pig\" burger and he thoroughly enjoyed it. 

I really like the size of their burgers. It's enough to satisfy and please your tastebuds but small enough you don't feel like a fata$$ afterwards. Also, you will have enough room in your stomach for their Jazz fries!!!! OMG....for those of you who have a weakness for potatoes or French fries in general, this is a must. Their gravy mixed with their \"crack sauce\" poured over lightly seasoned French fries....mmmmm....I'm salivating as I type this.

Fuku Burger is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace plaza just right after MGM Grand Hotel. Park in that $5 parking lot and Fuku burger will reimburse you. Just show the parking attendant your receipt and you get your money back. Plain and simple. So happy they're located at a restaurant. Now I don't have to stalk their social media pages to see where their next truck stop will be at. I will DEFINITELY be back. Who wants to go on a Fuku run? Let me know. I'm down to come along with ya!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place while in Vegas, because I figured I could have a burger anywhere. Well, I still ended up here and I'm glad I did. Fukuburger was definitely good.

What makes FUKUBURGER unique is the Asian inspired combinations in the burgers. It makes it different--but in a good way. Only of course if your palette is open to new things. I guess you wouldn't be a true foodie if it isnt. 

I had the KARAI SPICY BURGER, and let me tell you, it really IS SPICY! It definitely made me sweat. So if you don't plan on sweating while eating, do not order this. BUT if you are a fan of hot and spicy food, this is delicious and a great choice! But you've been warned on the spice/hot level. Again, I wish I didnt eat this with a group of coworkers and friends. Was a bit embarrassing sweating and constantly patting my head with a napkin and drinking soda.

The burger meat itself was delicious too. The other flavors they add on didn't take away from being able to taste the meat. It was cooked perfectly too. I believe the lady taking the order mentions they are all cooked medium? 

Now it can get a bit pricey when you add on fries and a soda. So expect to pay at least around $10 per person. The fries are good too though. They are seasoned and come with some dipping sauces that top it off. 

So definitely worth a shot. Like I said, it's different--but in a good way. Not the usual burger. Some may not like it, and that's fine. But if you are open to try new things and fusion of flavors, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"The place came highly recommended.  We ordered the loco moco and  the buta burger and the food was just so so.  The service was excellent.  The place was empty and very run down.  Maybe it was an off day but there are much better places for burgers like Shake Shack."}
{"text":"There are a lot of different burgers in Las Vegas, but FukuBurger has got to be the best for these reasons:

- Good cooks:  the burgers and fries here are always cooked well.  Never overcooked or rubbery, and super juicy and flavorful.
- simple menu: they stick to what they do well and excel at it.  Burgers and fries with an Asian twist.
- fun and whimsical: getting to choose your own fun name when they call you??? Amazing!!! This practice is typically frowned upon at Starbucks.. But it's celebrated here!

Do not miss: Jazz fries, and add an egg to your burger.  It will change your life!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first, but I was instantly converted! The Fuku burger patty was perfectly cooked and the bread was toasted to perfection! I'll definitely come back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here midafternoon with a few friends. Delicious Fuku moco with a juicy burger and great sauce. Perhaps adding some seaweed to the rice to add flavor? Anyways the place was clean, the service was great and prompt. Also got the Jazz fries which was a way too much food for me but it got devoured nonetheless by friends. Might wanna try the hotdog next! The burgers looked delicious too.,"}
{"text":"Congrats on the continued success!!! Still the only place in vegas to get a killer burger and not lose your shirt in the process. Inexpensive, made to order, and top notch. Fuku never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"Came w/ friends on a recommendation by one of the workers & ordered the #2 \"Tamago Burger.\" The burger itself is marinated in a sweet \"fuku\" sauce, very unique and light and & full of flavor. Topped in thin, seasoned, crispy onions complete with a sunny side up. Basically love from the first bite. Staff was very friendly, especially the girl w/ grey highlights who took our order & the chef is phenomenal as well. Perfect after a drink, but make sure you come in before 12 if you're on the strip location of Fuku."}
{"text":"I came to Las Vegas for a weekend trip with some friends from San Diego. After a friend recommended this place, we went. I ordered a Tamago burger with a medium soda and the guy charged me $23.23. When I asked for my receipt, the bottom chunk was ripped off and I told him it was fine. I didn't realize how expensive this place was so I had high expectations. 

When I got my burger, the guy forgot to give me my soda so I was pretty annoyed at that. What annoyed me even more was finding out that the guy overcharged me for my meal. Apparently, a burger and a drink shouldn't even cost that much. 

I came to this place on Saturday night. After driving back to San Diego the next day, my boyfriend called the restaurant. Long story short, they got down our number so that they can call us when the manager was ready to speak to us. After waiting for a bit, they didn't even help us. The lady just told us she wasn't sure who was working the day before because she wasn't there like okay, and? 

She didn't ask for my information to look for the copy of the transaction, even when I had the receipt in hand. Instead, she told us she couldn't help us, offered to call back tomorrow, and then she hung up.

Worst customer service ever.

(Btw, they didn't call back the next day.)"}
{"text":"Don't trust the reviews: this place is terrible! 
I really wanted to love this place but it fell short for many reasons:
- Restaurant was dirty; floors not well washed and tables full of trash
- Food was extremely salty the garlic fries for example had no fresh garlic but instead just over seasoned with garlic salt
- Burger as another yelped mentioned - all you can taste is the sauce
- Lastly prices were high. $4 fries not worth it. 

I had the mushroom burger, garlic fries and a drink. My friend Nick got the one with the egg. Both of us were disappointed. In-N-Out did a better burger. 

The one kudos I will give them was that the staff were friendly and I loved the fun nicknames. 

If we were drinking wandering the strip this place may have been fine. Sober... Not so great."}
{"text":"Best Burger spot on the strip AND in the west coast. Tamago burger and jazz fries is fire especially with extra crack sauce. Good atmosphere, great food, what else could u ask for. Good sh** Fuku Burger! From LBC to tha LV for this."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 12pm.
The last time we were here, Fukuburger was at the Linq, now they are at the Hawaiian market.  It was pretty quiet when we went, and not many people walking around. 

The restaurant was pretty quiet with only one table of customers. 

We ordered the Buta burger and kinoko burger.  Both had ample amount of toppings. The mushrooms on the kinoko burger were very good and flavourful.  I did find both burgers were greasy this time, making the bottom bun soggy when trying to pick up to eat.  

The cashier girl was very nice, and service was pretty good.  

Definitely worth trying if you like Asian fusion."}
{"text":"I had a burger with bacon?
Loaded fries with sauce all over.  

Sorry, not that memorable.  I was looking forward to trying this place when they were just a food truck(couple years at least).  It was ok.

I would like to return here or try the food truck and give them another try someday when I'm back in Vegas.  :)"}
{"text":"It's a decent burger.
The chicken burger is pretty good.

I had the tamago burger and it was just as good as any quick burger in its price range. I guess the word \"tamago\" made me think of the japanese omelette that I get at sushi places, so I was expecting more of a \"japanese\" flavor to the egg. Nah. It was just a normal cooked egg.

It's a good daytime place to stop that's easy on the wallet and great for filling your stomach."}
{"text":"I don't understand why I get food poisoning everytime I eat Fuku burger now. It was my favorite joint for awhile until the last time( may or June) I got food poisoning from the bunta burger( a burger that I always gotten before) at the truck. I've decided to give it a try again recently at the restaurant. I got my \"favorite burger and fries\" the bunta just like last time and the fries. The next day I had the worst food poisoning that lasted a whole week just like the time at the truck. So much for being my favorite burger spot that I hyped up about a lot to many people. Bachi Burger is probably the best alternative for this. Even tho it is pricy they will always serve you with a better quality of burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Yelp pretty much guides my restaurant choices, and I have to say, once again, my fellow Yelpers did not disappoint!! We stopped in here while having some huge yards from Fresh Grill. Fuku is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace on the strip. We had the Fuku burger and it was phenomenal!  The garlic fries are incredible, and that crack sauce is pretty addicting. Since everything tastes \"phenomenal\" after a few drinks (let alone half a yard), we decided we had to come back and make sure it was really THAT good!  (That, and we wanted MORE! Lol) I have to say, the service was as great as our first experience and the food really is delicious. I definitely recommend Fuku for a great burger and excellent service!!"}
{"text":"There is something seriously wrong with your taste buds if you didn't have a mouth orgasm after eating their Jazz Fries!!! You seriously need to stop eating all that spicy food or stop smoking or something, because damn I want to bathe in a bathtub full of that sauce. I ordered the Jazz fries along with the #2 Tamago Burger to go. The fries were just wow, living in L.A. I've had burgers of this type before, but they just perfected the fries and the sauces on it. The Burger was thick but not too thick to make you feel gross but it was cooked well, while still a bit pink in the middle like a burger should be. The onion strings, with the egg and the sauces made a damn good combination. I can't wait till the next time I'm in LV so I can get a different burger. 
Other than the food the service was great. It was nice to see a bunch of young people working here. They were all very helpful. I also like the fact that you can actually see the kitchen, so you know its clean. 
The place is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace and has a bar outside so you can get a drink with you food if you want. 
If you want new, different and interesting type of burger and fries if not, or if you don't think this place is amazing then just take your simple ass over to Chili's or Bobby Flay's to get a burger."}
{"text":"3/28/15  8:38 PM It's pronounced \"Foo koo\".

  It's a soft opening for the new restaurant location inside Hawiian Marketplace.  They have tables outside & inside.  Food was fantastic as always, this would be a great locals hang out.

  Burgers run $8, and fries are $4.   I got a number 4 Kinoko \"mushroom\" burger protein style no Wasabi  :)  Boyfriend ordered a number 3 Buta \"pig\" burger.  The juices that come out of these burgers is so delicious. You must try dipping your fries in the Crack sauce.  It's scary to try new things but we've been following their food truck for a few years now. I'm glad I tried it & now we're big fans. 

  The cooks thought my outbursts were hilarious when the \" I'm in love with da cocoa\" song was on.. they uh, cheered me on I think? I've seen every spoof video on YouTube & I thought it'd be funny to sing along.. We enjoyed the play lists they had & I got excited when the \"whip it through the..\" you know, I did the Emeril Laggase \"bam\" motion at the bar.  They were rolling.

 Always good times, music & fast service. Positively the best time we had all night just hanging out on the strip, not gambling.


Update 3/29/15 9:25 PM  Again. Service was amazing we caught them just before closing up shop here. I was floored when one of the cooks came up to ask how our food was tonight.  I replied,  \"Juicy\". I loved how locals treat locals. If tip you get Tip Jelly (reminds me if jello?).. Mine was strawberry flavored & I didn't take a picture but they cool your mouth off quickly.  Neatest thing ever. Is there no end to the smiles these guys bring?  :)"}
{"text":"The burgers taste delicious and jazz fries love it. The only problem is that they need somebody to wipe the tables.  That's why I don't give them 5 stars. It was not busy when we got there and all the tables look dirty. We sit down and we clean our table. 

But beside that the food is amazing! In my top 5 burger place."}
{"text":"I actually like the location on Spring Mountain a lot better! I've been to plenty of the locations and that's even including the ones in California. I think that the burgers here are okay and I've had some visits that were better than other's. The Jazzy fries or Jazz fries are so good! Tamago burger is one of my favorites as well as that Hot Link that they serve here! Prices are fair and in line with the rest of the other Burger Joints around town."}
{"text":"We went here while in Vegas and I looked up bomb places to eat. Came when we were drunk after a pool party and it was AWESOME! It hit the spot for sure! We got a #1 & #2 with fries & extra crack sauce. DELICIOUSNESS. We found it even more entertaining that you have to use a \"funny\" name when your order is called. Outside bar area has bomb music but drinks are weak. This place was so good we brought all our friends here before going back home. They loved it! We ate at an expensive sit down in Vegas and it sucked food wise. This was affordable and so gooood! 

One of the cashiers had a crap attitude the last time we went. Like she was miserable & hated her life working there she didn't even crack a smile... Until someone complained and called her out and her attitude changed quick. Every other employee was super cool tho!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to get here for a while when down in Vegas. Should have come sooner! Had the Tamago Burger and Jazz Fries. The burger was really good, but those fries with excellent gravy and their 'crack sauce' (Japanese mayo and a hint of spicy rooster perhaps) are worth the trip alone. 

I showed up on a chilly 10:45pm evening as their only two customers were leaving. They could have easily said they were shutting down, but didn't. The host/server was super congenial and made me feel welcome; like he was grateful to have another customer for the evening, rather than annoyed he had to stay open. Even had the chef come out to say hi! 
Go to Fukuburger, you won't be disappointed.

New location coming on Spring Mountain and Jones-ish? Soft open maybe next week."}
{"text":"FUKU BURGER. I pronounce it wrong, but I like it!

We decided to check out this burger place, due to a Groupon we purchased, which was $20 off the bill for $11. We are burger aficionados so thought this could be a good place to eat.

After our first full day in Vegas and further exploration of The Strip and other hotels like The Bellagio, we planned to visit FUKU Burger.

When we arrived it was very quiet, only a handful of people in the restaurant and nobody sat outside. The place is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace, a little food court area next to Chili's on The Strip.

I went for the Karai Burger, which was the spicy burger with habe√±ero kabayaki, which had a nice layer of guacamole and pickled cucumbers. The burger was nice and fresh and complemented well by the avocado. Maybe too well as the flavour overpowered the taste of the actual burger. My girlfriend opted for the Butu Burger, which was with bacon, cheese, pickled red onions and ginger, covered with a subtle BBQ sauce and wasabi mayo. Both burgers were very tasty!

The staff were friendly and you order at the counter similar to In And Out Burger but then the food is brought to you, whether you are inside or outside.

We shared a portion of fries, which were standard quality and the soft drinks are refillable, so good for taking a drink on the go. Most places in Vegas, or even the U.S. have refillable soft drinks.

Overall we were very satisfied with the food. It certainly filled the burger craving that I had :) I would recommend this place for anyone who fancy a good burger, fries and a drink for two for under $25. It is the perfect location for anyone staying in The Strip.

See this review and more on my blog: mcrphil.blogspot.co.uk"}
{"text":"This review is for the Fuku Burger truck on Fremont. My husband presented some art pieces down at Fremont Country Club on the corner of 6th and Fremont last evening and we were emerging with our items from the back door to the parking lot when the Fuku Burger truck emerged from my foggy, starving tired eyes at 11:30 pm. I put my car lights on hazards while we loaded up and I staggered over to the truck to say: how long are you open? Staff confirmed we had til 3am to make our choice. Thank goodness.
While we got things organized we ordered burgers. Oh my gosh. We scarfed down the Pig Burger with the bacon and sauce and it was delightful! Eating in the car rapidly was not ideal but the food was so wonderful!
I cannot wait to try more because we had to skip the fries at that late hour, wanting to have some normal sleep unruffled by our gastric wanderings. But next time we are ready!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for the second time and this is definitely one of the best burger spots around! Amazing Katsu burger as well if you're not into beef. Awesome service as well!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace.  Indoor & outdoor seating.  I went to use the bathroom & as I approached the restaurant, a guy blared out \"Drake's Baby Momma\" on an intercom.  Lol where did that come from?!  I fell in line with my girlfriends & found out that they call your order by nickname.  Haha!  Better start thinking of a clever nickname!

Tamago aka \"Egg\" Burger = Furikake, teriyaki & wasabi mayo, crispy onion strings, & a fried egg - De-licious!  The patty was thick & juicy, the bun was toasted & buttery, & all the fixings were great!"}
{"text":"Finally, a physical location! I have always had the worst luck with the truck. It seemed like I only ever had that fuku craving when the truck was off for the day. Now we have a cute little location tucked into the back of the Hawaiian Marketplace. If you don't see it at first it's to the back and your left. The new restaurant comes complete with an outdoor bar that you can place orders at, if you are 21 and up. Otherwise you can pop inside to the cute new restaurant place your order. Same great service and food as the original truck! FukuBurger is a MUST try if you're on the strip!

The Kinoko and Buta burgers are easily some of the best burgers in town, and you have to have the jazz fries.. It's just not optional."}
{"text":"Well this is the third brick and mortar Fukuburger incarnation I have been to. The first was in Hollywood, next the small Linq/FAME food court version, and now we are here.. in the Hawaiian Marketplace. Despite the great food, the first two locations didn't last long but heres to hoping this one survives. 

Fukuburger is probably the best (and for me the only) reason to visit the Hawaiian Marketplace, an oddly located and mostly defunct shopping complex in front of Polo Towers. Despite the questionable location, the food has never been better. Five burgers and a chicken sandwich are the backbone of the menu along with a variety of sides. I had the Buta burger which is essentially a bacon cheeseburger and the jazz fries with crack sauce (fries covered in mayo and gravy). The Buta was delicious with fresh crisp bacon and the tangy fuku sauce created a great contrast. My friend's chicken katsu sandwich featuring a panko crusted chicken fillet and shredded cabbage is worth getting as well. The fries were not bad but all of the sauces made the fries a little soggy. The menu is reasonably priced ($7-9 for entrees and $4-5 for sides) but portions could be a little bigger. 

The restaurant though not as flashy as their old Hollywood location is still inviting and well appointed. There is a large patio area with views of City Center across the street along with plenty of spacious booths inside. On the downside they do not have a full bar and parking can be a little complicated. Overall a great edition to the Strip; I just hope people know about this spot and are able to find it. 

Also remember to tip and get that tip jelly!"}
{"text":"A quarter size moth floating in a sauce of Fuku mess 
Stick to what you're good at (food truck) and close this restaurant. 

Filthy ambiance: An element that's so important to any restaurant, especially one that's right off the strip. Heavy water stains from the misters that coat the machines and counter tops. Dirty seats that look like they came from Goodwill. Overall a bar that just doesn't look appealing enough to even purchase a simple beer from. The music inside has constant profanity and it's so loud I can't even hear anyone speak.

Poor customer service: Such a crucial part of any small business but when your staff doesn't smile nor look happy serving (girl with grey hair) who does that reflect? I've experienced so many small restaurants who's staff is genuinely happy and provides above and beyond customer service. Who's fault is that really? The management failing to lead by example or just the team member not giving a _______.

Drenched patty: I guess when it comes to eating burgers everyone has their own style. I guess that's why so many people rave about the sauce which IMO is drenched and soaked. It's a burger floating in sauce sandwiched between two buns. Then to top it off you have a QUARTER SIZE MOTH hidden as a surprise for me. =X"}
{"text":"The boyfriend saw that Fuku Burger was the #1 burger place on their website so we wanted to check it out. I've eaten there before at the older location over a year ago. This location is located inside the Hawaiian Marketplace. We parked in the pay parking in the lot across the street ($5) although we found out later that we could have received validation if we told the guy guarding the lot in advance. I ordered the spicy burger over rice (with no bun) and it was cooked perfect and tasted great. The boyfriend ordered the Fuku Moko. He thought his was just ok, nothing special. Also I was pretty disappointed in the \"Garlic\" fries. It tasted like the grease was old or something and gave the fries a weird aftertaste and I didn't taste any garlic. I think for two people you should receive more than two tiny little sauce containers. The white crack sauce is pretty good... but you should at least receive a normal size 2 oz portion. 

The place is pretty small and I think it might be nice to check it out when it heats up and you can sit at the outside bar. Our table was clean, but when the boyfriend grabbed the Sriracha  bottle it was caked in oil and grime and who knows what else. Someone really needs to make sure those bottles are cleaned. While we were eating the TV's were both on an infomercial. We asked the girl behind the counter to change the channel. She and someone from the back changed one of the TV's but then each TV was on a different channel but both had the volume on, so it was actually worse. I don't know it was a pretty slow night and there was only one other group, I think they could have done better by us. Especially since you pay at the beginning and for $35 plus $5 tip and you have to go get your own food, drink and clean off your own table.... I'm just not sure why I should be tipping."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the burger. 
5 stars for the friendly service.
Kinda hard to find. Next to Chilis on the Las Vegas Blvd strip, near Coca-Cola and M&Ms World. 

I thought this place was going to be more like JapaDog in Vancouver. But all their meats are beef products. Would be nice to see a kurabuta (pork belly) patty or derivation thereof."}
{"text":"10/10 simply delicious and different! It's a Japanese fusion burger restaurant. There are only six options for burgers but the 3/6 that my friends and I tried were all delicious. 

I had the karai (spicy) burger. It was more of a sweet and a slightly spicy taste which went very well with the cabbages. The bun was sweet and crunchy at the bottom. My friends greatly enjoyed their mushroom and egg burgers. 

GET THE FRIES WITH CRACK SAUCE. I had it yesterday and I'm still thinking about it. The Crack sauce aka their mayo is seriously addictive. It goes so well with the crispy outside, soft inside fries. 

Will definitely visit fuku again the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"A few of us didn't feel like eating at our employee dining room so we walked over to Fuku Burger to try it out.  The spot was very trendy with cool paintings on the walls.  Ordering was easy as 1, 2 3.  I was contemplating between the Katsu Chicken burger or the Naga Dog.  I asked the cashier which one was more popular and she mentioned the Katsu Chicken.  I ordered it. 

We didn't wait too long before our order was ready.  We were all surprise to see that there were two layers of very cooked/deep fried pieces of chicken katsu between the buns.  There is no way I could eat the burger with two chicken katsu patty so I removed one from the burger and shared that piece with others.  I managed to finish my chicken katsu but yes, it was very greasy and it was over fried.

Service was good and food was ok.  I may return in the future to try other items."}
{"text":"Fine burgers and good company is a must on the strip Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Awesome menu and good service. Really easy to get to, hidden gem in the Hawaiian market in front of Polo Towers. Only thing is, the actual size of their burgers are pretty tiny. So after I ate its deliciousness - I was still kind of hungry. Also, their fry sauce is yummy (crack sauce, I believe), but they over season their fries heavily so tell them light seasoning or none at all. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I walked through a mile of margarita-swilling, yard-of-beer chugging tourists to get to this place. And it was worth every step. 

This little hole in the wall, somewhat hidden amidst the theme restaurants and cheesy chains, offers a limited menu that is anything but limited on flavor. 

I ordered the Tamago, or\"egg\", Burger, which features a tasty patty, sweetened with a teriyaki sauce that gave it a crack-like quality (I mean, if I ever had crack, it would be this.) Topping this deliciousness was delicately fried crispy onion straws and a fried egg. As a side, I ordered the garlic fries and they do not disappoint. 

So if off the beaten path is your thing, walk the gauntlet, embrace the odd, and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries! Tried the katsu burger on Thursday, went back Sunday for more. The jazz fries are fantastic and the owner was a champ!"}
{"text":"Had the #2, Tamago aka Egg Burger!
All-beef Fuku-patty with furikake, teriyaki and wasabi mayo, finished with crispy onion strings and a fried egg.

It was literally finger licking good!  From the very first bite, I knew it'd be awesome as the egg yolk started to run down my fingers.  If you like teriyaki creations this is the one for you.

The ninja fries were good as well... make sure to ask for \"crack\" sauce on the side.  The regular garlic fries were okay as well... not the greatest but will satisfy your fry cravings.  Come here for the burgers!

Service was excellent for a order and sit down place, the girl at the front came to check on us several times. Located in the Hawaiian Market Place... parking is a hassle here but if you're staying or visiting the strip it's a quick walk."}
{"text":"We just came back from this burger joint and I feel I have to write a review. The burgers were amazing! I had the bacon burger, the patty is quite thick, seasoned well with the most delicious sauce. The bacon was crispy yet light, as it should be...not like other burger restaurants that give u thick and chewy bacon--if I wanted thickly sliced pork belly, would  I order bacon? My hubby had the mushroom burger and the mushroom they use is so flavorful it really enhances the beef patty. I really like that they use quality meat and you can see there's care and thought put into every single ingredient. All that for $7.99 each, sure hope they make some profit out of it. Oh the garlic fries r tasty as well.
My son is a chef in a high end restaurant and for lunch they charge $18 for a hamburger, it was thicker but not even as juicy as Fuku's, I had to put mayo on my designer burger at his restaurant.
Go try Fuku's, you would not be disappointed. What great value compared to McDonalds, Dairy Queen and Wendy's."}
{"text":"Ive been to just about EVERY Burger Spot on the STRIP this place is fricken insanely GOOD, PRICE  FLAVOR , VALUE all amazing!! FRIES with Crack Sauce omg and the #3 with an Egg f#$?! ... Do yourselves a Favor come here!!"}
{"text":"I've known about Fukuburger since they made a special truck appearance on season 2 of the Great Food Truck Race.  But even with me flying in from SF for vacation several times, I never really got around to searching for their truck.  Now that they have their own brick and mortar shop right on the Strip and with added publicity that they have just been voted as the Eater Vegas's No.1 Burger Joint (http://bit.ly/1Kpkj2S), I had to check them out!

I visited their store right for a late lunch so the place wasn't too busy at the time.  Great for me since I didn't have to worry about a long wait time for my burger.  One thing to note though is that I just had a Dole Whip Float at Pineapple Park beforehand, so I was less than moderately hungry.  I basically went with ordering the Kinoko without any fries.

Kinoko -- http://bit.ly/1GbHAPw
\"Mushroom Burger\" w/ All-beef Fuku-Patty, grilled shitake mushrooms, pickled red ginger, teriyaki, and wasabi mayo
The Kinoko Burger is just amazing!  It's just full of umami flavor extracted from the mushrooms and pickled ginger.  The burger was cooked just right and it was the perfect size to satisfy my burger craving.  The presentation was slightly messy, but wasn't too difficult to keep together.  Overall, let me say that I've tried a lot of burgers, but I think it's one of the best burgers I've ever had!

Though I've only had one of their burgers (as I stated being one of the best), it's just enough for me to warrant a return visit to FukuBurger next time I go to Vegas.  Judging from the taste of their burger, I can see why it was voted Best Vegas Burger Joint.  I'd love to come back to try their other burgers, plus their hot dogs and their Jazz Fries. Is the Kinoko my all-time favorite burger?  It's pretty damn close, but I still enjoy Bachi Burger's Kiki's Burger just a bit more.  But the bright side is that FukuBurger is a cheaper burger option than Bachi and plus it's on the Strip which is very convenient.  A much deserved 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Tried the buta burger, tamago burger, & jazz fries. Everything was very good. Super flavorful burgers. The sauce on the Jazz fries was fantastic! I'll definitely be back!"}

We stumbled upon this place on Yelp and decided to give it a shot. First of all, they give 2-hour parking validation at Hawaiian Center (which is the next parking entrance after MGM in LV Bldv) and I parked at Aria just to find that. The food was EXTREMELY tasty. I've never had such unique burger experience in my life. This is the street burger version of Umami Burger, no joke. Will come back again."}
{"text":"So I finally got to try Fuku Burger. We went there for lunch the other day. They opened a bit late due to an unforseen problem and for my patience, I was give a coupon for a free burger :) ...the staff were friendly, upbeat and helpful. Good jojo, there. I ordered a Tamagu Burger, cooked medium with well done egg and the hubby went for the Buta Burger, cooked medium as well, both with garlic fries. My Tamagu came on a grilled bun with lots of crispy onion strings. Could not get enough of them. My husband kept stealing them from my plate.

Here's my burger verdict. The Tamagu was ok. The patty was cooked well done instead of medium but it was still ok. Would have wanted it a little jucier and not crunchy. The Buta Burger was ok too.. Hubby ate it all and he ate half of mine. He said he preferred the Tamagu. The garlic fries were freshly cooked and crunchy. It was a little salty for my taste. A serving is enough for 2 people.

By the way, instead of a free burger, they gave us the fries for free. Not bad.

Not sure If I'll go back but I suggest you give them a try at least once."}
{"text":"Everything you hear is true -- absolutely amazing burger and yes you MUST try the Jazz fries!! Fresh cooked to order and incredible complex flavors that come together perfectly! Try the Tamago or Kinoko if you like shiitake mushrooms. And the staff is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Food - 4.5
Service - 4.5
Value - 4.5

We really enjoyed our Kinoko burgers here the other night.  Ingredients were fresh, tasty and high quality.  The teriyaki sauce was slightly on the heavier-side as far as taste was concerned so it may be worth asking them to put less on it or have them place it on the side.  

Service was good once they realized they had some customers waiting the counter, but we had to yell a few times until someone noticed (it was a slow night there)."}
{"text":"Fukuburger. Try saying that without offending someone.

It's a bit of a shame that this awesome little burger shop is kind of hidden on the strip. It's located in the Hawaiian Marketplace, an area I had no idea existed. It's definitely worth the trip.

The first thing I noticed was that the inside was cool. There's a lot going on on the walls, this sort of anime art on the walls. It seemed like a great place just to hang out. They also had a few TVs going on and wasn't too busy. Also, the music was on point. They were playing Drake, Big Sean, Kendrick Lamar etc. 

The other awesome thing was when you order your food, you give them a joke name they have to call out when your order is ready. I went with the ever reliable, \"Tig Ole Bitties\". I thought that was a fun touch to the standard fast food affair. 

As for the food, the Tamago \"Egg\" Burger is their #1 burger and I can't argue. You can never go wrong with a fried egg on a burger and the crispy onion strings added a nice crunch and saltiness to the burger. The wasabi mayo added a touch of heat but wasn't slathered on there.

The Buta \"Pig\" Burger was also great. It's a lot of meat as it's a burger patty with smoked bacon and BBQ sauce and the wasabi mayo. Again, it was a ton of meat and flavor. Definitely felt like I got my money's worth with the burgers.

You also shouldn't skip the fries when you are here. They have CRACK fries there, and yes, they are fantastic. 

We spent probably over an hour in there just relaxing and eating this delicious food. Also, they had American Ninja Warrior on the TV and we got into it. Even the people working there got into the show as well. That's just a mark of a place that doesn't take itself too seriously. Providing good service and having a fun time as well. 

When the people working there are having fun, you are bound to have fun as well. Get a burger here! Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Food and customer service was good. Place was empty and we couldn't find a clean table. We found one with some salt spilled so we cleaned it ourselves. $30 for two seems a little bit expensive but I will still be back"}
{"text":"Foods good as always. Not a fan of the location. Not the easiest to get to. As well because of the location the prices are obvisously more than they should be. Don't get me wrong this is still a really good burger. Just not worth the effort that it takes to go to the strip, park, and pay more than you should. If you are a tourist and right there it is a must try. Outside of that there are burgers that are the same or better with less hassle of strip that offer more meat for a better price point."}
{"text":"Yummy cool burger options! This is a hidden treasure and the guys are so polite. I will be back on my next trip to VEGAS!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Friendly staff! Good prices! 

I recommend the number 2 (Tamago Burger) 

You can tell the staff takes pride in their food, and they should, because it is delicious."}
{"text":"Fuku is my favorite type of sloppy gourmet burger. As in a little less fancy and a little more street. Hai. 

Where In N Out is my husbands daily go to, Fuku Burger is mine. 

These are Asian-fusion burgers, specifically Japanese, and they are damn good. Mind you I'm half Japanese and half hamburger. But really, I prefer Fuku over the more expensive gourmet fusion burgers out there besides Bachi. Totally different animal even though it's not. If you know you know. The point: be prepared for the sauce. If you're a plain hamburger purist, as in no cheese please, I am one of you and this is not that kind of place. You are not coming here to taste a distinct beef patty. 

The Buta burger is my pick because it has bacon. If you're not familiar with Asian flavors or fusion, I'd suggest you go this way or to the Fuku (the plain). But do an egg if that's your thing (\"the Tamago\") or the Karai if you're a foodie, especially a burger foodie. That's a thing right... or is it just me? 

Whatever you do! Do not freak out and take out the pink pickled ginger god damnit. Do you hear? Do you copy? My husband tried to do this the first time he tried Fuku and I nearly divorced him. Seriously. So stubborn. I know it sounds weird. Even when you know what it is, it sounds weird. I mean pickled ginger on a burger? But you have to trust the concepts here. Plus you can always trust the Japanese when it comes to the American burger. As if they cannot fathom that they didn't invent it themselves, they translate it the best. 

You can't get these kind of burgers at these kind of prices around here often. Especially near this location. My favorite burger for under $8? You got me for life. 

Sober or drunk, I can't get enough. This is the spot since they validate parking at this location. 

The Jazz Fries are a must; that special Fuku sauce is murder."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick/cheap late lunch close to hotel on south strip and this place checked all the boxes. The magic is in the sauce. Hint of soy was an unexpected and awesome surprise. Get the spicy burger if you like it hot. Fries with crack sauce were solid as well. 

5 stars for taste. Loss of 1 star because they have no bathroom..? Was looking for a place to wash my hands after a messy burger and nada."}
{"text":"Started from the bottom, now they are here. 

Food truck spot that now has a permanent location in the Hawaiian marketplace. The food is a little greasy but I enjoyed their burger and fries. I had the Buta burger and I love ginger, so it was a fun touch to Japanese-up a burger. 

Everyone there was hilarious. They played good music, so honestly, we stuck around and chilled long after our leftover fries had grown cold. It was also amazing to watch a couple of super blazed dudes come in and want to order the entire menu. 

Why is the Hawaiian marketplace the saddest place on the strip? It is kind of dead, especially in the back area where I went to go to use the bathroom. It just needs to fill up a little more with businesses and people need to actually walk off of the sidewalk and venture further in to find stuff."}
{"text":"Nothing gets me like a good burger with a runny egg, which was exactly what the Tamago Burger ($7.99) offered. Initially, I thought of a fully cooked eggs like an omelet when I heard tamago, but thank goodness for pictures as it's actually a fried egg on your burger. On top of that, it comes with furkake and fried onion strings. The patty is juicy and thick while all of the ingredients were packed into the burger. It wa so good and definitely fills you up. I also added an order of garlic fries ($3.99), which comes with ketchup and their special crack sauce. I dripped my fries in both sauces, which paired well with the crispy fries.

The downfall was that they did take quite some time for our food to be ready. In addition, they do this interesting thing where you use a funny nickname for your order name. Unfortunately, I'm not very creative in that department and neither were my friends, so that left us with blank faces and awkward silences as we were trying to come up with a nickname for our orders."}
{"text":"I CAN'T BELIEVE I NEVER WROTE A REVIEW FOR THIS OH MY GOD. Anyways while my gf and I where here on vacation last June (I know super late review) we stumbled upon this burger place! Where I also happened to break my sunglasses before entering :*(. It has been awhile but I still remember my first experience here and it was amazing! The staff are so cool and definitely love the energy they have! Always feels like a fun atmosphere as you walk in, which is a great thing to have being on the strip! Their menu wasn't large from what I remember but the pictures can make you drool. I wanted to eat every burger that I saw because it looked delicious. I ordered the Buta Burger I believe and oh man I was in heaven. Nice sloppy burger and the flavors that came out. I could die and be alright after eating this burger! 

Definitely DEFINITELY will come back when I go back to Vegas this June!"}
{"text":"Great service here. This place is laid back and serves unpretentious burgers done right. The employee I talked to seemed pretty excited about the work they were doing and made gave us great recommendations for what to order. This is one of the few places on the Strip that I'll come back to the next time I'm I'm town.

Check out their simple menu. We had the tamago (egg) hamburger and the katsu chicken sandwich. Huge portions and great service! Oh, and tip the guys over there if you can. They deserve it!"}
{"text":"It's wonderful to be able to enjoy Fukuburger at any time of the day/night. My experience at this location was MUCH better than my last visit at the short lived Linq Fuku. My burger was cooked perfectly, juicy and delicious. Togarashi fries were on point and the service was fast and friendly. Parking is not the most convenient, I still wish they would open a stand alone location off the Strip.  I think the SW part of town would be perfect."}
{"text":"Alright.. it's Fuku burger.  Honestly, I don't really goto many of these food stands while I'm in vegas, but this got such high marks I had to go and check it out. 

It was the summer, so I wasn't really a huge fan of walking 2 casinos over in the heat to visit here, but it's not their fault.  

I've actually been here twice.  I like it, but it's not really worth the detour honestly.  The burger is a little on the pricy side and to be quite honest, I really prefer Shake Shack at NYNY.  The jazz fries are kind overrated. Don't understand the hype.

I've had 2 of the burgers here.  The Karai (spicy?) and the Tamago.  Honestly, nothing super memorable.  I definitely preferred the Tamago, and if I came here, I'd probably order that one again (but honestly, I prefer Shake Shack or In N Out... these non-traditional burgers really just aren't my thing... if you really wanted to go asian style, at least do something like mosburger with the rice patty buns).

The price is reasonable I guess.  Anyways, there's my 2 cents."}
{"text":"Great Burgers!!! Gotta try the Buta-Burger and the fries with Crack Sauce is addicting! A must try while in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"First time in Vegas and had no idea where to eat.  Randomly found Fuku Burger walking down the strip. Hands down the best burger I have ever had.  You have to try the garlic fries and the naga dog.  It's off the chain."}
{"text":"We parked at the Aria and ended up trekking across 3 foot bridges to get to the Hawaiian market where FukuBurger is located. Good parking option is not obvious, so location is definitely catered more toward strip foot traffic. It was hot, and the seating/bar area outside the restaurant was totally empty, with no staffing at all. We almost thought it was closed before realizing they also had seating inside. The cashier at the counter seemed preoccupied with something as we walked in Sunday around dinnertime. Not much customer service. They don't have their own restroom, you have to use the one inside the oddly empty and creepy Hawaiian Market, which also houses a random Indian restaurant. We got the Buta and the Kinoko. The burgers were decent, though I was a little put off by how rare the meat was. I usually like my burgers done well or medium well, but we were not asked and given a choice in this case. The Kinoko was slightly over-sauced and salty. Also got an order of garlic fries with crack sauce and banana ketchup. The fries were not garlicky at all and tasted pretty underwhelming. Ketchup tasted just like something out of a Heinz bottle, not sure why they call it banana ketchup.  For the amount of trouble it took to get there, I'm not sure we'll visit again."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I got the Tamago aka \"egg\" burger, Kinoko aka \"mushroom\" burger and the gravy fries (forgot the name).  Everything about this meal was so good! I'd definitely come back more than once!"}
{"text":"Yaas Fukuburger, yAaaaAaas!

I originally knew about Fukuburger back when its location in Hollywood was still around. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to give it a try in California because it closed down.

Flash forward to a couple of years later, in preparation for a quick trip to Vegas. I stumbled upon Fukuburger's locations after a quick food search on Yelp.

We decided to go to the location in the Hawaiian Plaza, conveniently located near MGM Grand on the strip.

I decided to order the Tamago burger with a side of jazz fries. Even though we ate here for dinner, it is easy to imagine just how popular Fukuburger is as a late-night joint.

The Tamago burger is stacked with crispy fried onions, plenty of delicious sauce, a perfect ooey gooey fried egg and a hearty beef patty. Soooo good. The jazz fries were also crisp and SO tasty with the combination of gravy and \"crack\" sauce.

It's a must-have when you're in Vegas. Crazy good."}
{"text":"Damn good burger and fries. I think you will like this place. It's pretty clever inside and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"was there last night for a quick bite, friendly staff, burger is maded from scratch, with ff it is a bomb, also hoka there, great atmosphere will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I really liked the types of burgers offered.
 I ordered take out for my family from the online menu: the Tamago, Buta and chicken Katsu Burger ... Along with the Jazz & Garlic Fries ... I was super bummed when I got there though to see there was a FukuMoco ... Because I sooo would've ordered that for myself. I'll have to go back again soon, because seeing that made me not really want my burger. Please add it to ur online menu. My family was a bit bummed too because they would've wanted to try it as well. But I'm the pregnant one who was so sad to have missed that on the menu. I know now. So ... Next time for sure."}
{"text":"FukuBurger? Say what?
 
   This review answers the what concerning one of the newest burger establishments to land on the Las Vegas Strip. It is based from the dining experience we had here on a late April Sunday evening. 

   When you hear the sound fuKu, it conveys a vulgar word instead of a culinary accomplishment. Fuku is a positive word in Japan that means \"lucky.\" FuKu Burger is really Lucky Burger. Preceding and concurrent to opening their brick and mortar location on the Las Vegas Strip, the FuKuBurger food truck has been delivering this lucky burger to Las Vegans. When it came to my brother and I, Yelp had delivered this lucky burger to us through highly acclaimed ratings. Being up for a highly acclaimed burger experience, we'd give it a try.

   FuKu Burger is the lucky burger that is an anchor in an unlucky location. It sits in the highly vacated Hawaiian Marketplace which is an island of calm between MGM Grand and Planet Hollywood. The fact that Hawaiian Marketplace is an island is calm might be a contributor to the sundry of available tables on a patio overlooking the heart of the City Center.

  There are two seating arrangements. They are either inside or outside. Being that it was a nice evening we decided to sit on the patio taking in the people activity along the Las Vegas Strip with a backdrop of the City Center. My complaint about the patio was the loud and borderline obnoxious music blasting overhead. The noise had an aggressive beat that stole from the dining experience.

   The service was friendly. At the time that we were analyzing the menu, which pretty much is six different burgers, a hot dog, and two styles of fries; the woman at the outside bar was personable and knowledgeable. Because FuKu Burger is self service, the interaction with the staff is minimal. In similar fashion to its name, it is self service with a unique twist. When we ordered, the lady encouraged us to give them a nickname. After a few minutes of sitting in the patio enjoying our beverages, she'd call out, \"Smiley,\" my brother's high school name.

   The highlight of my FukuBurger dining experience was the Kinoko aka \"mushroom\" burger with Jazz fries. I could of ordered the Buta \"pig\" burger, but I love my mushrooms. The Kinoko burger was a palette of culinary art between two perfect hamburger buns. The mouth watering beef burger was the canvas for melted American cheese interspersed with shitake  mushrooms, strokes of wasabe mayo , teriyaki, and strands of pickled red ginger. The Jazz fried that are sold separate complimented the unique burger. The crack sauce and gravy were the unique ingredients that elevated the taste.

    In a way, FuKu Burger is the lucky burger. At least on Yelp. After my experience enjoying a unique and tasty Kinoko burger and Jazz fries on the Las Vegas Strip on the patio overlooking the heart of City Center, I have added one more to FuKu Burger's cannon of highly-acclaimed rated reviews."}
{"text":"I love fusion places, this is a great burger place with an Asian taste. I got the Mushroom burger. The burger was cooked perfectly medium and juicyyyyyy. The bun was soft and flaky. The mushrooms were cooked perfectly and the toppings and sauce all came together to make an amazing tasting burger, but one that you've definitely haven't tasted before! 
You walk in order and sit down and wait for your food. Service was fast but we were the only ones there because it was about 11:00."}
{"text":"My wife and I really liked FukuBurger.  It is probably a good thing I don't live near a FukuBurger because I would eat there far too often. 

My wife had the #2: Tomago burger, I had the #5:  Karai and we shared an order of the jazz fries.  Both burgers were great and the fries were very good.  I was enough food that we couldn't finish all the fries.

I've seen some reviews complain that it is a little pricey for burgers and fries, but frankly it is really not that bad for a place on the strip.  We paid A LOT more for meals on our trip to Vegas that we enjoyed a lot less."}
{"text":"Asked for the most flavorful burger, and got the tomanga burger, probably spelled it wrong.  It was pretty good. I am a burger connoisseur, I come to Vegas to try burgers. and it was pretty good.  My only wish is more of that asian flavor would be in the burger.  I had to get pretty deep into the burger to taste that asian flavor.    Anyways I will definitely comeback to try the other burgers.  Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon so we decided to stop in for lunch this past Monday.  It's located in the Hawaiian Marketplace. Parking is $5!!  However, someone else's Yelp review said if you tell the lot guard you're eating at Fuku he won't charge you and you just have to show a receipt later?  Anyway, with the $5 parking, the Groupon kind of washes out, lol.

However, the food is so worth it. I've only ever eaten Fuku to go, so I've never been able to experience a fresh off the grill burger and OMG it's amazing.  I got the tamago burger and the egg was cooked exactly how I love it, runny as you bite into it.  I love how the burger is so freakin' juicy but the bread never gets soggy.  There's some sort of magic to that.

People rave about the crack sauce, but i don't find it especially interesting.  I love the garlic seasoned fries dipped in ranch or ketchup. So yummy!

The place is small and bathrooms are a bit of a walk into the main building, but it's clean and and the booths aren't crammed together.  The service is okay as well.  The music is really loud so it's hard to have a conversation without yelling, but we didn't mind."}
{"text":"Yummy! Glad we found the new location. Got the burger with the fried egg and was super yummy. Defin get fries with crack sauce"}
{"text":"It's nice not to chase the truck around town. Got here on the second day of soft opening. Nice decor. High tech menu board. Simple menu of five specialty burgers and a few additional items. Went with the Kinoko Burger because of the mushrooms and teri sauce. Flavor was spot on. Fries were crispy. Food took a while to come out but it was worth the wait. The owner, Noel, is a friend. Was nice seeing him there. Good luck, Bro. Nice job! This location is on Jones in China Town in front of 168."}
{"text":"The burgers I had were really tasty. Best  japanese fusion place I have ever been too. The flavors are bold but don't take away from the meat. I think it is much better than bachi burger and cheaper. Ask for more crack sauce on the side for the fries. You won't be sorry. I am from Philly, and it is on my top burger places, if not the top. Delicious and affordable. A must go if you are a burger fan and open to non-traditional flavors."}
{"text":"Awesome burger. Got the Karai and it was EPIC!  Our waitress was Sabrina and she was fantastic - and smoking hot. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and wanted to give it a try. The guy at the counter who took our order was super friendly and helpful. We ordered the Tamago burger and Jazz fries. Both were delicious!! Wish this place had a location in California."}
{"text":"The Fuku burger is impressed that burger meat have some secret receipts I guess, like it."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after hearing about it for a long time. I am simple when it comes to Burgers meaning I don't like a lot of toppings so I can enjoy the taste of the meat. I ordered a cheeseburger medium rare and fries. The burger was close to well done and not much flavor. I was happy with the size of the burger and the bun but the meat was nothing I'd go back for. I did like the fries as they were crispy and nicely seasoned. With Bobby's Burger Palace and Shake Shack across the street those are much better choices"}
{"text":"The Kinoko Burger was great.  I would have preferred a bit more ginger but the wife loved it.  Hint, order the small size drink because refills are free.
Update:  I was just informed, ask for more ginger (shoga) next time at no extra charge, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Dont know whats all this hype is about. I didnt enjoy my burgers. My burger tasted nothing but the sauce itself. For the price you pay, I dont think it is worth it at all. I ordered that Karai Burger everyone was crazy about but eh, yeah it was spicy but whatever. Too much sauce and it gave me a headache. The actual portion was pretty small too.

Boyfriend got the first burger which looked like a traditional burger and it was just OK. 

With the not so friendly price and ridiculous parking situation, I dont see myself coming back here again. I rather go to Gordon Ramsey Burgr. The restaurant itself wasnt too big either. It had about 4-5 booths and that was it. Menu had about 6-7 different burgers with 2 french fries option with some Hawaiian fusion dish with Loco Moco but was named differently. When I walked in during lunch time, there was only one person waiting for his burger. It was so empty that I had to question myself why did I come here because I was so annoyed with the whole parking. I could have walked yeah but I stayed at Palazzo and there is no way I could have walked all the way from there. Thought about parkinf at the Miracle Mile Shop and walk but my legs were too tired from walking so much the night before.

The girl working at the counter was nice though and thats the only reason why I am giving this place a three star rating."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food.
2 starts for the value.
This review is for the new location on Jones which isn't up on Yelp yet.

Went to lunch with a coworker, we had 2 burgers ( they were great) 2 jazz fries, 1 bottle of water, & added bacon to one burger, total $34.00.

The burgers have great flavor but aren't that big to justify $7.99 each. The fries are good, but I'm not sure why some people rave about a little gravy and flavored mayo being drizzled on them is that big of a deal?

Doing the math, they must have charged about $5.00 to add bacon to the burger?"}
{"text":"Was going to take pics, but it looked too good to delay sinking my teeth into - maybe I'll grab some next time -- because there DEFINITELY will be a next time!

Crispy buns
Cold veggies!!
Perfect amount of Teri taste
HIGH quality beef! Thick patties
Staff is SUPER nice."}
{"text":"Words cannot express my happiness in finally sampling the tasty concotions of the Tamago burger.  Ok, just imagine a nicely-cooked burger with fried onions, furikake and a runny egg.  Now, add their famous Jazz fries?  It's a wrap.  By far the tastiest burger I have had in some time.  The service was wonderful, the servers were fun to talk to and when you drop a buck in the tip cup, you'll get yourself \"Tip Jelly\".  Not to mention some nice smiles from the servers.  

My buddy got the regular fries, a tamago burger AND a katsu burger.  REALLY......I was floored.  

Try it folks, good food and you know what they say, you get what you paid for."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, including a fantastic veggie burger. Get the habanero sauce. The staff is friendly and down to earth."}
{"text":"woah delicious stuff. I liked the Jazz fries a lot more than the Fuku fries or whatever they were called. we came here twice during our last visit and both times were great. very friendly staff and no problems at all. liked the spicy burger, the chicken one was alright, and the egg burger was excellent. you can get an egg on any of the burgers for $1 more."}
{"text":"Just go! If you're visiting Vegas and wanna opt for local food and culture and steer from all the fancy overpriced bloodsuckers on the strip, FUKUBURGER is a top priority on your bucket list. :)"}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp and also stumbled upon the outdoor lounge/hookah bar next door. I believe they work together ? Very conveniently located next to each other :) My friend and I ordered the fuku-burger and the hot dog. The burger was really juicy and flavorful however I was not too fond of the onions in it. The hotdog/sausage was really good but a bit too spicy for me to handle. Next time I would love to try their jazz fries and the tamago \"egg\" burger. We also got the frozen daquiri at their bar outside. We mixed all their flavors together. I believe there were 4 flavors. We ordered the smaller size one and added two shots of rum. It reminds me fat Tuesday's but more of an Asian touch to it due to their flavors . It was really good! Got a nice buzz, would definitely order again :)"}
{"text":"SO glad I chose Fuku over all the overpriced dining options while in Vegas!
The service is exceptional and coming from LA, I love me some Asian Fusion food!
Had to get the jazz fries since I am addicted to poutine and this seemed similar, as well as the chicken sandwich.
Fries were good, but nothing like poutine, just fries with gravy. Still, they were very good, as well as the chicken was tasty as well, still would have preferred white meat over gray which was a bit of a turn off.
The guys had burgers and fries and loved them as well.
Prices are fair, so are portions, one of the best values and most unique and tasty flavors on the strip!
Love the vibe of the place and that the cook came to check on us.
Love the margarita pitchers they sell here, keeping mine as a piggybank for my son at home.
While this would not have 5 stars in LA, here is was a memorable meal and one of the funnest dinners we had while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oh man was this burger amazing!

Just got into Vegas from the airport and was craving a burger -- found this place and it was perfect. The burgers are strange but delicious, the fries were also amazing. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Fukuburger moved to their new place in the Hawaiian Marketplace close to the MGM and the Planet Hollywood. I think this location is much better than their old location at the Linq. 

They have outdoor seating with an outdoor bar where you can order food as well (if you're under 21, you have to order inside). Indoor, the decor was Asian pop art-inspired with upbeat music, which gave the place an urban feel to it.

The food is an Asian-infused take on burgers, which gives the burgers a unique taste. I had the tamago burger (a burger with an egg and fried onion crispies) and it was the best tasting burger I've had in a while. The burger patty itself was juicy and savory, the onion crispies made the burger crunchy (sometimes the crunch makes things taste so much better), the sauce added a certain tangy-sweetness to it, and the bread was crispy, yet soft and edible. PERFECT.

Staff acted like she was trying to force being nice to us, but that didn't matter because the food was still bomb. A must go."}
{"text":"This place is legit! We ordered the Buta buger (miso-glazed bacon, BBQ sauce, ginger), Karai buger (cucumber, avocado cream, spicy mayo), and the garlic fries. The burgers are of very good quality meat and are charred to perfection. At first, the combination of ingredients doesn't sound like they'd work, but they absolutely do. Very good balance in the sweet, salty and spicy. Good job. The fries were fried to a perfect crisp and the seasoning was very good. 

Service was splendid and price was fair. This is one of the better burgers I've had in the past few months which may not sound very impressive to most, but if you knew how many burgers I eat per week, you'd understand. Please do not hesitate to give them a try."}
{"text":"This joint has a lot of stars. Location is superb. Across Aria and Cosmopolitan. No table service. Only have 2 beers selection. Budlight and Mondelo. Which sux big time. They need to clean the place. Not really in a good shape. But, the Burger was excellent!! I will miss it for sure. I picked with mushrooms and ginger. That was one of the best burger in my life. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Buta-Burger was perfectly balanced with the sweetness of BBQ and the tartness of ginger. Fries were great, had good seasoning. Never had Asian Fusion done so right! 

Come here if you are looking for something new and tasty. Our server was super sweet on top of everything."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Please brave the parking situation and make it out here. You'll be happy you did! I recommend the katsu burger, tamago burger and don't you DARE skip on the Jazz fries."}
{"text":"Never in my 7 years of reviewing my experiences on Yelp have I ever encountered any business owner who is so unabashedly unprofessional that it would warrant a review such as this. I'm aghast at the owner's response as I didn't mention things in my initial review like unclean tables, or dipping napkins in our water cups to clean our hands, as I gave this place the benefit of the doubt that this wasn't their norm.

My original 3 star review, along with the addendum that I added as a response to the owner's comment on my original review will be at the bottom of this piece.

What happens when you combine the petulant entitlement of a spoilt millennial, a startling lack of ethics, and unbridled hostility? An experience at Fukuburger.

I grew up in a family that owned a b2b produce company that spanned multiple generations. They supplied restaurants & grocers with produce. I also had to go through multiple food business courses at UNLV's hotel college for my minor. This program is rated neck & neck with Cornell for the top program in the country. I understand how food costs are determined & I understand purchasing. I also understand that no two customers are alike and that matters of taste and value are subjective and unique to each person. Ex: bun cost. I don't eat them, therefore, where they're made is irrelevant to me.

Anyone who has attended a US public school is familiar with a bell curve. In grading, some people will fail, some will ace the class, but the majority of people fall somewhere in the middle. They're not bad, they're not exceptional, they're simply average. From my profile, anyone can see that my reviews follow a statistically natural bell curve. Most of my experiences are neither terrible or so exceptional that I proselytize for them. Such was my initial experiences w/ Fuku.

While the owner tries to silence dissent by throwing around baseless accusations of racism and resorts to a favorite of tyrants everywhere - libelous character assassination, he fails to address my values as a customer. 

Quizzically, the owner believes that stating his restaurant's & clientele's style is \"racist.\" This place doesn't serve rustic, country fare. It's a place that has a tatted, suggestive menu girl, hip hop on the speakers, sports on TV, & Asian pop art on the walls. Saying it is urban and reminds me of the pop/hip hop ABDC show is no more racist than calling a place a hipster hangout or biker dive bar.

I believe strongly in the principles of freedom of speech, information & dissent. I believe in standing up for truth, regardless of the slings and arrows a business owner throws. Customers have a right to express average experiences.

People should know that the owner hypocritically lectures me on my review ethics despite dating a former Yelp intern, and he violates the TOS by offering meals, free of charge, to those who write positive reviews, as evidenced by his owner comments on other reviews that have been flagged. No wonder his avg. is so high. I don't know who he's friends with, or why he's so offended that he felt the need to go on the warpath, but nothing would surprise me. I don't advertise that I review on Yelp to businesses, nor have I ever accepted compensation in exchange for a favorable review. My reviews are trustworthy.

May this 3rd business shutter like the other 2 locations.
--------------
Original review: This place is the definition of hype. I've had their food truck fare and was meh about it. Gave them another chance and went here on 6/4/15. I had the butta burger along with fries. Nothing about the food warrants these prices, especially because everything is ala carte and will run in the midteens for a burger, fries and a drink.

Okay, so everyone here looks like they're from ABDC & it has an urban SoCal vibe. The food has artistically drizzled mayonnaise atop it. Whatever, the flavors are lacking and the value just isn't there.

***edited to add - don't worry, I won't give this place another dime. Apparently commenting on the vibe or clientele  is racist, even though Yelp has such things \"hipster\" vibe ambience option. Owner is resorting to petty attacks because his feelings are hurt because of a 3 star review, not a 1 star, a THREE star review. The food was bland to me and not a good value. Not everyone is going to be an \"omg I'm a fan\" of the business. Maybe the other locations would still be open if I alone thought that the prices weren't justified but that's not reality."}
{"text":"We stopped in on 11/24/2015 for dinner. After reading reviews, I see that the parking fee would have been refunded if a receipt was presented. Management: why not inform your customers of this perk? It would have added to our experience.

The food was great and the service very friendly. I had the Kinoko and my hubby the Fukuburger. Both were cooked to perfection, juicy and delicious! We will definitely be back, great food!!! We will recommend to our friends and family."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because of the Groupon deal. Ordered the Buta burger, the Kinoko burger, and the fries w/ banana ketchup and crack sauce. Fries were good, and burgers were OMG delicious. Prices are great for Vegas, and service was A+. The young lady at the counter was extremely friendly & professional, and even went out of her way to throw our trash away for us. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the fries. Although the fries and crack sauce were good (not great, but good), the \"banana\" ketchup tasted like nothing more than regular ketchup, so I was a bit disappointed by that. But the burgers were possibly the best I've ever eaten!! Definitely will consider coming back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stopped here cuz it looked cool as I was hanging by the LINQ. The concept seemed brilliant, but the food didn't deliver. I just realized it's been almost a year since I ate here, and forgot to write a review since I was utterly disappointed in the burger. The togarashi fries were OK. I'm okay sticking to Bachi or in n out. 

One extra star for service. They were cool peeps."}
{"text":"Im a big burger fan and was recommended this place for best burgers on the strip.

We tried the Buta Burger and it was REAL good. Perfectly juicy and had a great teriyaki-ish taste.

I'd skip the fries though, they were just average, and the Jazz fries with gravy were just alright.

The crack sauce is great though, almost like a sweet mayo sauce.


For under $10, I'd say this place definitely has one of the best burgers around - and this is from someone who has eaten at most of the notable burger places in NYC.

If you're looking for more expensive gourmet burgers over $20, head over to Holsteins across the street for something fancier."}
{"text":"For those of us who are looking for a great hamburger served with a twist of flavors that work wonders in your mouth, that's a definite place to go."}
{"text":"Server was courteous, burger was served fairly quickly and presented nicely, but meat was lukewarm and flavor did not jump out. 
Across the street was Bobby Flay's burger joint. We ate there last night and for a $1.50 more than Fuku I had one of the best burgers in my life. 
Also, Fuku, if you want to know how to serve a hot burger, stop by Smashburger. 
They have this mastered!
So, unfortunately, I do not recommend Fuku."}
{"text":"I am currently in Las Vegas for a DJ convention, and was looking for a simple, chill restaurant that had wonderful service, welcoming hosts, and amazing food. Fuku Burger delivered all this and more, with the topper being a Japanese-inspired joint that spoke volumes to my nerdy anime-loving soul. Walking in, the walls are decorated with rectangular Japanese portraits that are reminiscent of Gwen Stefani's \"Harajuku Lovers\" series. The menu was simple to read, understand, and to select food from. The Kinoko burger with mushrooms and pickled red ginger was juicy with the right amount of tangy crunch--and gone quickly, as it was excellent. The fries with the accompaniments of their notorious \"crack\" sauce and sweet ketchup were perfectly seasoned and I couldn't get enough of them. Above all this, the staff, led by Elise and Marcus, were wonderful to chat with and made sure this Midwestern man was welcomed. And, I was. I love restaurants that focus on keeping it simple, and this one made me feel right at home. I highly recommend Fuku to anyone, and I hope many will spring up in Chicago and abroad. Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Two Words. Crack Sauce. 

Seriously. Wife and I ordered three portions of the fries with this sauce. We are usually pretty healthy eaters but these fries + sauce were amazing.

The staff here was also very friendly. I don't eat red meat and they were able to make me a chicken sandwich that wasn't listed on the menu (they only have one chicken option). The sandwich was HUGE and only priced at $8 bucks. Not a bad value on the strip!

I can't wait to come back to get some more crack fries. I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Came in town with some newbies, walking the strip and stumbled on Fuku.  Ordered one of every burger and some fries with gravy and crack sauce.  Everything was cooked to perfection and exploded with flavor.  Service was incredible.  These guys are doing something different, I like it."}
{"text":"Great Japanese/Hawaiian take with seasonings and sauces on a well-dressed burger. I've had the Tomago (egg) Burger, Buta-burger (3 types of pork), Kinoko (mushroom) Burger, garlic fries, and Jazz fries. Everything is good. The inside counter service is a little confusing. The new location is ok. I like the old one at the Linq. It has a pop Japanese Hawaiian surf/skate anime feel to the decor and it's pretty small inside. 

T-shirts are $20. 

The bar is very limited. The alcohol drinks must be taken separately on the outside register. The explanation is a little vague. Burgers are a little pricey for being a small joint without wait staff or real dish ware. There is a wifi network named \"fuku burger guest\" but there is no password. When I asked about it, the young woman says \"I don't know it\". With such juicy saucy items, it wouldn't hurt to hand out wet napkins with the orders. 

It's trendy. If you can get in and out of there quick, it's worth it and tasty."}
{"text":"I don't do this very often but it's getting a five just for the food.

I was skeptical when we came here. We went inside and it was barren and told to go back outside. We sat at the \"bar\" (an empty, non stocked bar). Our waitresses half heartedly made us come up with \"clever names\" despite our groups general reluctance. I thought the whole place was just dumb.

Then the food came! A Japanese twist on burgers! Miso bacon, pickled ginger, wasabi mayo, and Japanese bbq sauce! Who knew a Japanese burger could be so great. And at $7.99 it beat Bobby Flays burger joint across the street. We split an order of crack fries (enough for three guys). They were covered in sauces that I can't name but were worth it. Everyone in my group got a different burger and everyone loved t (I want the burger with egg next time)

Our meals also came with a Japanese jelly candy for dessert. It was a long gooey straw and no one wanted to try theirs first but once we all did we liked it.

The owner was friendly and came out and talked to us giving us lots of not \"the strip\" or touristy ideas for to have fun in Las Vegas.

If you want a fine dining experience don't come here but don't let the paltry decor (they just opened) or the awkward waitstaff (they'll learn) stop you. The food was great (literally unbelievably so as i was annoyed my group picked this place since I thought it would suck.)"}
