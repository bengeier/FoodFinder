{"text":"extremely friendly server. very patient with explaining prices and dishes + recommendations.   saag paneer and shahi paneer were awesome. great portions for price.   would def recommend their tiffin service for international students nearby. ridiculously cheap for the service.  will def visit again"}
{"text":"A decent restaurant in the north Etobicoke area. The food was fine. Their in-store service isn't that good, so home delivery or takeout would be a better option.   We went for Chana Tikki, Veg Kurma, Tandoori Roti, Amritsari Kulcha Combo and a Gulab Jamun. Chana Tikki and Veg Kurma was good. Tandoori Roti could have been a little better as it was burnt at many places, especially around the edges. Amritsari Kulcha Combo was good, and so was Gulab Jamun. The food, overall, is fine but no wow factor. We also had a chai once we went to their restaurant, but it wasn't really good - had to leave it there itself.   The ambiance is very restauranty. They have a decent seating capacity with about 6-7 booths. However, the cheap Punjabi pop music playing on the TV and a gigantic mood killer. The service was a little slow. The second time, when we ordered, we went for home delivery instead of dine-in.  There is a limited parking outside the restaurant but the plaza adjacent to it has a large parking, so that can be an option as well.   Overall, I would avoid going to this place - but still a decent option for takeout or home delivery."}
{"text":"There paratha combo is good. But their Hakka Chinese dishes are horrible.  I ordered Manchurian with rice combo.  After 15 Mins wait I was given a big plate of Manchurian and jeera rice  The Manchurian was uncooked probably they fried it in hurry so it  was uncooked in center and had kalonji seeds (its added in Punjabi curries not Chinese dishes)  Rice that accompanied Manchurian looked like stale (a day old) rice. I updated them that Manchurian was uncooked so they did not charge me for that but I was very disappointed and decided not to order anything  Their speciality is north Indian food so parathas, veg curries aregood so stick to that do not order chinese food or you will end up getting disappointed and frustrated."}
