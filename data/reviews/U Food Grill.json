{"text":"I was so happy to see healthy food in an airport terminal that I overlooked something that should have been a show stopper. The woman behind the counter had on rubber gloves and every single finger tip on her gloves was busted through due to her super long fake fingernails so the gloves were useless. On top of that she wore the same gloves while handling money, making unfries, and making smoothies.   I guess it should be no wonder that I had to use an AIRPLANE VOMIT BAG that day. A couple of hours after eating I got really queasy. After being miserable for about an hour, it finally came up and I suddenly felt better again."}
{"text":"Whoa, is Cleveland Hopkins suddenly becoming health-conscious or something? Every time I turn around, there's another healthy airport option. Excellent!  U Food is located in terminal B and is one of very few options in this area. But it's actually really good! A grilled chicken sandwich, very large and on a susbtantial roll, with mixed greens, slivered almonds, and some yummy dressing? Sure! The fries are baked, not fried,and they are surprisingly great. Not just \"airport  decent,\" but really good on their own merit. Same thing with the smoothies. They are on the same level as Liquid Planet.   This stand actually leaves you feeling somewhat energetic and happy after eating the food, as opposed to lethargic and terrible about yourself because you caved yet again to airport food. I would highly recommend.  Only complaint is that the service is lackluster and a bit slow."}
{"text":"Why is it that when you place an order you suddenly become victim to  the lame, inept, useless employees behind the counter. The cook was on the phone, with the manager mentioning that  the next cook is going to be late because his car got stolen. She was pissed off that she might have to work till 5:00pm tonight. All this in ear shot and view of the 3 customers that are waiting for food.  What really makes this bad is the food sucked! Chicken fingers, unfries and water"}
{"text":"Great healthier option in my go to terminal of CLE.  I have not tried much of their food, however when I get that early flight out their smoothies hit just the spot."}
{"text":"4 stars for the wonderful selection of smoothies, fresh juices, and all this in an airport when grabbing a meal can be a task.   I swear they have smoothies that are like meals in a cup too; super thick and full of all the good stuff your body deserves before getting on a long flight back to the motherland!  I'd recommend this to traveler who is on the go and needs a healthy boost! But do beware, they are a tad on the slow side which is a pain when trying to rush onto a flight. They tend to get busy as well so bring your \"calm\" side to line; you'll need it."}
{"text":"This chain food joint has the looks, catchy smoothie names, but that's really all it has going for it. After flying for the past two weeks out of Cleveland Int'l, I finally jumped on the food options here. My recommendation? Steer clear of all food here.  PROS: + Smoothies: get the only star here. They use real fruit and you can add additional boosts which is always a plus. Tastewise, I'm happy.  CONS: - Food: wow oh wow is it terrible here. I ordered a \"panini\" and observed in silent horror as the kitchen worker put what looked like Oscar Meyer prepackaged sliced ham into a microwave to heat up. The resulting product I took back to my gate resembled a total fail (soppy, mushy inside with nuked tomatoes and ham), and upon tasting, I threw it away. Please trust me on this when I say you can do much better at an airport than eat here. - Service: I swear the past two times I've been here, every, I mean EVERY, worker looks and acts if they hate their job so damn much they're just dying to let you know. And honestly, if you're going to have this hip, chic, healthy brand image, it doesn't help when your workers look like death. Call me silly, but when the workers at a \"healthy\" food joint have that terrible of an image, I start questioning the quality of the food I'm getting. Seriously cash register girl, lose the 'tude or go work at McDonalds where I wouldn't care how you treated me as long as I got my food quickly.   Hungry? Go to the bar one gate down and grab some greasy bar food rather than wasting your appetite and money on UFood. If you want something light, then I would say drop by UFood for a smoothie, just don't be too surprised to see the terribly unhappy cash register girl yelling at the even more unhappy smoothie girl to make your damn smoothie."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the previous poster.  I was really hungry while on a flight delay and made the big mistake of ordering here.  Poorly prepared food by workers who looked like they wanted to be anywhere but here.   I ordered the Better Bacon Burger with fries and ended up throwing it away.  The bacon looked like it had been cooked weeks ago and the burger meat would have broken a tooth.  Nice posters though, they get 1 star for the marketing posters."}
