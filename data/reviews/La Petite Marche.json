{"text":"Enormous portions, fresh food, nice ambiance, beautiful experience!  Thanks! :)"}
{"text":"The place is very nice and Original . The food is tasty and they are generous with portions."}
{"text":"Selon moi et mon conjoint, un des meilleurs brunch en ville les fins de semaine. Très bon, service très efficace.  Par contre, si vous rechercher un endroit calme ce n'est pas la place car, c'est grand et remplie de monde a pleine capacité.  A refaire et refaire."}
{"text":"Holy delicious! Great espresso, great vegetarian breakfast selection! Really cool atmosphere. You should definitely eat their crepes."}
{"text":"On Monday for lunch, this place was packed! Food is served authentically French with nice presentation."}
{"text":"Went there during a break between client visits. Food was good, waitresses were nice. I loved the bathroom wall heh The place isnt fantastically designed but it has character.."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, excellent menu and fast service. Seems that there are new owners, and the woman made a point of coming around and checking that we were enjoying our meal, which we really appreciated. It also was not overly crowded and had an unpretentious but still classy atmosphere. I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Nous allons déjeuner régulièrement à ce resto. Le service est toujours rapide. Belle portion de fruits. Vous devez absolument essayer les crêpes elles sont un peu sucrées avec des graines de lin."}
{"text":"This truly is a gem in Montreal. Cozy ambience, reasonable prices, and most importantly - great food! Everything you can possibly want  for breakfast and brunch. Crepes are to die for they hardly need the maple syrup accompanying them. Staff can be more engaging, but with food so good, who wants to talk? I recommend this place for all my out of town friends who visit."}
{"text":"Solid brunch! We tried to go to L'Avenue which apparently had rockstar reviews on Yelp but the line was winding around the corner and we were bordering \"hangry.\"  I have never been one to wait for hours in a line to eat acclaimed food; though I consider myself a wannabe foodie, I cannot tell the huge difference between five star-wait-3-hours food and four star-don't-wait-but-still-damn-good food.  There are diminishing returns at a point.  Anyway, we wandered into this place, which is cavernous and huge.  Sort of maze like layout which makes me think it was built and then added on to over the years.  Casual tavern type atmosphere. Told to sit anywhere we like so settled by a small table near the open porch (the porch itself was packed on this fine July day).  Tried to decipher the menu with my high school French and settled on the 2 egg breakfast.  A steal for Montreal.  2 eggs over medium, a generous helping of fresh fruit, toast, country potatoes and bacon, coffee, and OJ for something like 8 bucks.  Totally refueled us for our marathon trek up Mount Royal and back around town for the rest of the day.  Friendly service with no pressure (almost wish there were some pressure) to pay the check (which you do up front).  Most customers appear to be locals, French speaking.     I recommend this place if you're looking for a friendly local place for pretty standard brunch fare at a more than reasonable price and don't want to wait hours for the gourmet stuff."}
{"text":"Depuis que j'ai découvert La Petite Marche, c'est l'endroit où je préfère aller avec mes amis pour bruncher en semaine. C'est un endroit sympathique, accessible en métro et les assiettes sont généreuses."}
{"text":"j'adore la petite marche! the food is tres delicious, and everything on ur plate is fresh and full of flavor. gets really busy on the weekends, but the wait is worth it. the staff is usually running around and sometimes hard to get a hold of but only cos its so busy. the patio (though tight) is wonderful to sit at on a warm day, but the sunroom inside is equally nice.  lots of variety on the menu, mainly eggs bennies, crepes and omelettes. portions are huge, and they come with a lot of sides: sauteed mushrooms, seasoned roasted potatoes, bacon, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, foccacia toast! and the most perfect poached eggs! around $16 per average with coffee/tea/juice  must try: poached eggs on foccaccia with smoked salmon :)"}
{"text":"We had brunch here and it was a typical French restaurant. We like seating outside.  We ordered the following: Egg Benedict with spinach (egg and the sauce on top was just alright- had better, I can taste the water residue from the making of the egg) Egg with sausage (good) Egg with bacon (good) Crepe with chocolate (ok) Bagel with cream cheese (ok) Each of the meal had fresh orange juice and fruits (these were very good)"}
{"text":"I have fond memories of La Petite Marche because I was taken here by an old friend before I had even moved to Montreal. We were seated outside on their lovely little terrasse and I was perusing the menu with difficulty. After all, it was in francais, and I am, much to some people's dismay, a whole lotta anglophone. As I people watched the babes passing by on a lovely summer day, my cafe au lait soon arrived and it was the size of my head. Glorious! Thankfully, after consuming this delicious brunch bevie, I still had room for my ginormous breakfast. Holy moly...eggs, fruit, meat, toast...it's goodness all over the place! Since my first encounter with LPM, I've returned many times...to sit outside and enjoy the lovely weather, or inside to adore the gorgeous artwork that adorns the walls. It's really quite a beautiful spot on the bustling street of St. Denis where happy people succumb to the age-old dilemma of eating large amounts of food because their eyes are simply bigger than their stomachs. And, amen to that!"}
{"text":"Reviews are all right.  Great wait staff.  Great Food.  No matter what you order, whether it be crepes or an omelette comes with fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, ham, potatoes, bread, eggs.  all very fresh too.  strong recommend."}
{"text":"Ambiance moyenne. Nous n'avons vraiment de serveuse.. Peu personnalisé. Manquais de sauce dans mon bénédictine. Pas à retourner"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in Montreal. Cozy , cute & lots of natural light in or a cute patio for the summer . Fast service. Often packed . Go early"}
{"text":"The brunch plates were big and beautiful but we experienced very poor service (part of our meal was forgotten and our food arrived lukewarm). I'd probably give this place another chance...eventually."}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant for breakfast in Montreal  though it can be much better. The blueberry crèpe i had wasn't extraordinary with frozen blueberry.     And there was no french toast on the menu ( it's really a must for a breakfast restaurant in Montreal!). And there were just a tiny quantity of maple syrup with the crepe (try Universel restaurant on Peel street for french toast and lots of maple syrup!).  The service was ok but they don't fill our coffees and i had to ask for a refill to have more coffee.  Not bad but you can find much better breakfast restaurants in Montreal !     Bon un restaurant de brunch sur le plateau, disons que je n'ai pas été émerveillé par la qualité de la nourriture, bonne mais plutôt ordinaire, j'avais commandé une crêpe au bleuets elle était bonne mais les bleuets était clairement surgelés.   De plus il n'y a pas de pain doré un incontournable et vous avez droit à seulement une petite quantité de sirop d'érable (essayer le restaurant universel rue peel pour du sirop d'érable à volonté, de l'excellent pain doré ainsi que des toasts fourni avec le repas).   Et le service est ordinaire il devrait laisser du café en quantité suffisante sur la table si les serveuse ne passe pas régulièrement au tables car j'ai du demandé d'autre café.  Pas mal mais loins de la qualité des autres endroits à déjeuner à Montréal."}
{"text":"Beaucoup de monde à l'heure du brunch le dimanche, la queue n'est pas très bien délimitée, c'est un peu l'anarchie... Une fois installés, c'est mieux.  La nourriture est bonne mais les seules formules existantes n'ont pas d'alternatives végétariennes.  Bon service et le petit jus d'orange servi gratuitement est apprécié.  Pour 15$ le menu je me serai attendu à un peux mieux."}
{"text":"I used to like to go to La Petite Marche for breakfast, but in the past year or so, I started thinking that there are many better places to go. I think the quality of the food went down in the past year or two. Although their breakfast deals are pretty cheap, it gets quite expensive if you order items à la carte, and the quality of the food is disappointing. The baguette bread is not real baguette :( and the rest of the food is just OK, no more. Espresso drinks are fine, though. The place is quite big, so it's a good option for groups that are not too picky about the food. The bathroom downstairs has such a strange setup (two toilet bowls side by side in the same room?!). The decor is nice, and if you get to sit on the patio or near the windows, you can enjoy the light outside. Whenever my friends ask me to meet up with them at that place, I go eat there... but I won't be the one who picks that place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Good service and large quantity of food for the price. The ingredient quality was lacking a bit and service fell apart at the end."}
{"text":"It's going to feel awkward standing in one doorway after another, feeling in the way of busy servers looking for somebody, anybody to tell you where to sit. You'll be tempted to tap someone speeding by with a tray in their hands to ask for a hostess in  what feels like three big houses stitched together to make the restaurant that is La Petite Marche.  Worry not weekend bruncher, they see you and they will get you tucked in at a table so you can have a long, leisurely brunch consisting of so many wonderful flavors - just for you.  *If you can talk your way into the skylight room do it - great light and adds to the whole experience.  Lots of menus will be handed to you, look for the brunch menu. Order some crepes that come with (deep breath): Eggs bacon ham sausage sauteed mushrooms baguette fresh fruit maple syrup coffee  No kidding. Sound like too much? Mais non. Just a little taste of everything on your plate. It's sooooo good. Noise level can be a little high, it looks difficult to maneuver a stroller through and tables can be pretty close together. The food is completely worth it. Bring a friend to catch up with and enjoy this hidden gem."}
{"text":"The way French brunch should be. The way all brunch should be. New Yorkers think they know brunch. I thought I did too. Then there was this. This is a game-changer. Like brunch itself is a game changer.  You need more game.  Eggs Benedict. Fresh OJ. Beautiful people. This place should be a song. Who has Pharrell's number?   More stuff."}
{"text":"Meh. You get what you pay for, I guess. Average food for a cheap price naturally draws huge crowds for the Sunday brunch... But honestly... They even decided to put tables in the basement to accommodate more people...  The service is always fresh and pretty but also hit or miss :)"}
{"text":"Super traditional breakfast with delicious tiny mushrooms. Not a great place for dinner on the other hand..."}
{"text":"Didn't like the experience at all when I've been with a friend. Food was very average, the service was very slow, on top the waitress wrote the wrong order and the newer one took another half an hour to be served even if wasn't our fault. The worse part is that it was an early morning in a Sunday and the place was not even busy, if it was I would understand having a so slow service and average meal, sausage was swimming in oil :("}
{"text":"J'ai pris le hamburger à l'autruche. Quantités très généreuses pour le prix et c'était très bon. Le seul petit bémol est pour la serveuse ... Elle ne savait pas ce qu'ils avaient en cocktails et elle m'a demandé 2 fois si je voulais des frittes ou de la salade, pour finalement l'amener des frittes ..."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Wednesday morning. This place is in the Plateau district and is heavily French-speaking. Regardless, I managed to order a benedicts dish and it was really tasty. I'd come back again. Recommended."}
{"text":"Bon, classique, rien de fou, rien d'exceptionnel Mais rapport qualité/prix un peu en défaveur de la qualité  On y reviendra pas, y'en de meilleurs pour le même prix autour"}
{"text":"J'ai testé cet endroit trois fois, une fois pour le brunch, pour un verre et enfin pour le souper.  Le brunch était bon mais pas beaucoup de choix pour les végétariens. La terrasse est agréable pour boire un verre. La fois suivante j'ai pris la pizza pesto et j'ai été déçu, trop de tomates séchées à mon goût et on en sentait pas assez le pesto.  Au niveau du service c'est assez mitigé, les serveuses ne sont pas forcément aimables et souriantes.  Je garderai cet endroit en tête juste pour aller boire un verre mais pas plus."}
{"text":"Nice place for brunch, quite spatious, I was under the impression it was going to be smaller (probably because of the name La \"petite\" marche). It has a nice big skylight, so lots of natural light inside. It is cozy and has warm decor inside. I also remember a brick wall and some nice mozaique tiles on the floor. We were a group of 8 and we had a lot of fun, the place gives you this nice vibe. I had the spinach Benedictines, it is the only reason I go to any place for brunch, to get Benedictine eggs. Liked them a lot. The portions are not huge like other places, they are just fine. I would say it is a very decent and solid place for brunch in Montreal, not awesome, not the best, but I'm pretty sure I will come back."}
{"text":"Went there twice - Once for drinks, once for lunch.  Staff is nice. Beer is cold. food is good."}
{"text":"Thanks for yelp, I found this awesome brunch place on my last trip in Montreal.  Great brunch menu French menu ONLY, staff speaks English Everything is good on the menu Spacious, no wait  Worth the visit if you are in Montreal  Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Really not a huge fan. I've been here 3-4 times. Each time I'm a little underwhelmed. There's just nothing that stands out that I can comment on. Nothing's bad, don't get me wrong. I just can't give it 4 stars.   The building itself is super weird. Have a good look around. Everything's been built and renovated by an amateur. Electrical plugs without covers, unfinished ceramics, holes in the drywall, etc... The owner has no attention to detail. It's been the same for years now! Everything feels like an unfinished project."}
{"text":"Looking for breakfast spot,this place recommended by a local,we were chatting  with. The menu,and the clientele were both French. I took that as a good  sign! Started with the bowl of latte which was yummy and huge! I opted for eggs Bennie and  Salmon,my wife choose the blueberry Crepe. Both meals were fantastic. They both came with bread and a  Breakfast sausage, bacon with a large bowl of fruit salad,Everything was very  fairly priced.Kudos to our very sweet  waitress for her patience with our Lack of french!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast place in Montreal. Food is fresh, yummy, colorful, i just really love it all. I used to work around the corner so I grabbed take-out at least 3-4times a week, sometimes for bfast, lunch or dinner. As good as it gets."}
{"text":"So I was looking for a good brunch place near the Le Plateau-Mont Royal area, and Yelp led me to this place. Let me just say that the portions are HUGE. For around $18, including tip, you can get a hearty breakfast of eggs, toast, potatoes with herbs, a bowl of fruit -- cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, strawberry, grapes, oranges (more fruits than I've eaten in a loooong time), sausage, bacon, smoked salmon, a coffee, orange juice, etc. And this is just one order.   The food was all well-done, but rather unremarkable overall. But for the value, it simply cannot be beat. Service was cordial and attentive. No complaints -- the food was well-executed, just nothing particularly exciting. Overall a solid brunch spot."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch.  I had the crepes with cheese and mushrooms, with a side of great fresh fruit.  Everyone at our table was quite pleased with their selection.  Great setting and good atmosphere.  Lots of seating available, so good for groups."}
{"text":"Short trip to Montreal and this place was recommended to us by a friend/local.  The service was nice and the food was very tasty.  Kindof exactly what you want from a Montreal brunch."}
{"text":"Très bon brunch !"}
{"text":"Bon   déjeuner    goûteux     ayant   beaucoup   de  saveur  !!!   Je  vais  y   retourner  c'est  sûr"}
{"text":"There is something both pretty and ramshackle about La Petite Marche (watchout for that small step) with it's narrow, romantic wooden terasse on St Denis, wooden details, successive rooms opening with columns, theatrical inner space, cozy corners with benches... Directly across from the National Theatre School and full of food and drink at fairly student-friendly prices, La Petite Marche often hums with the young, focused, inspired energy of a highly competitive arts school.  The plates are bountiful, bright, fresh and filling, perfect to sit and graze on through from breakfast to afternoon. The menu is several pages of fairly standard Quebecois cafe food done with heart and a big spirit. Tasty on several levels."}
{"text":"Terrasse sur rue tout de même agréable au soleil, ambiance  désuète qui a pourtant son charme. Pour sûre, Super breakfast place, je conseil les ufs bénédictine, un régale!!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm the odd ball out if everyone gave it such high reviews but I really wasn't impressed. There was nothing healthy to eat on the brunch menu so opted out for a coffee instead (which was not fantastic). The service was super slow. For the people who did eat at my table, they were not too impressed either. I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant on Saint-Denis, perfect for breakfast or lunch.  Large indoor seating area, and quaint little patio, perfect for sitting on a nice sunny day.  The food is quite good, and served in very large portions, and at prices that are easy on the wallet.  The service from our waitress was excellent & friendly.  This place is probably worth 4 and 1/2 stars - check it out!"}
{"text":"Beau décor! La bouffe est très simple et abordable! On aime y aller pour la simplicité de l'endroit et sa qualité!"}
{"text":"C'était ma deuxième fois ici et je pense que ça sera ma dernière, Montréal a beaucoup d'autres places pour les déjeuners, mieux qu'ici. Vieux décor, service moyen, bon pour les familles et l'âge d'or."}
{"text":"Endroit de prédilection en semaine pour des rencontres d'équipes. Le service est rapide, les cafés sont bons (sauf le latte deca qui goûte le brûlé) et les repas copieux nous remplissent bien l'estomac ! Serveuse très souriante et aimable. Même si nous restons longtemps, nous ne sommes jamais dérangés par le staff."}
{"text":"Grosse deception. On m'avait vanté le mérite de cette place... Et bien je ne le recommanderai pas du tout à mon tour. D'abord, une qualité des aliments vraiment mediocre: ca goute rien. Enfin si, l'omelette avait un gout de lampe à petrole. Sérieusement... Un peu de respect pour nos papilles ! Les fruits, les oeufs, le cheddar... Rien de valable. Et cerise sur le gateau, le service etait juste deplorable. Un bonjour du bout des levres, pas un sourire, pas un au revoir. Bref un echec total."}
{"text":"Très belle place et très grande donc plutôt bruyante. Le service était très efficace. Le choix permet de répondre à tous les types de mangeurs."}
{"text":"Quand je vais à un resto comme La Petite Marche, je suis garantie de voir mon chum se rouler les yeux parce qu'il sait que le long menu veut simplement dire que je vais avoir de la difficulté à faire mon choix. En plus d'y avoir de nombreuses options, autant pour les amoureux du salé que du sucré, les ingérdients sont toujours frais et le pain baguette a une croûte croustillante juste comme il le faut.  Mon seul point faible est qu'à chaque visite, j'ai eu l'impression d'avoir à attendre longtemps pour me faire servir, et même pour qu'on me dise simplement bonjour et que l'on me demande si je veux quelque chose à boire en attendant de prendre ma commande.  Ils se reprennent lorsque les repas arrivent parce qu'ils sont remplissants. Pensez à mettre des pantalons qui accommoderont les bons gros brunchs!"}
{"text":"It was a monumental mess!!! Not necessarily because of the food, but for service as well.  We were a group of about 16 people. We made reservations in advance so you'd figure that they would be prepared for us right? No so much. They got our orders all messed up and gave us a ton of attitude all while speaking to us with a condescending voice. The food came out barely warm. I ordered an eggs Benedict with asparagus. The english muffin was super greasy. The yolks hard as rock. The asparagus overcooked and the sauce way too salty. I am not recommending this place. There are many , many other great places to go get brunch in Montreal and surroundings!"}
