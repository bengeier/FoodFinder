{"text":"5 stars for the food- i truly love the food here, everything is delicious and the margaritas are too good to not get  5 stars for the service- any and every server I have had has exceeded my expectations! wonderful people! There is one bartender there, I cant remember his name, he is maybe in his 30's, definitely heavier set guy, mexican and i think he wears glasses; I don't enjoy being served by him, I've overheard some sexually inappropriate comments coming from him concerning other paying customers in the restaurant. I find this highly offense and unprofessional, it makes me extremely uncomfortable and I also wonder what comments he has made about my body sexually. All of the hostesses there are nice, friendly and full of smiles, except one, I dont know her name either. She is mexican, and last time I was in there she was handing out food, which was new, considering she is the girl who never smiles and makes it seem like it's a painful task to seat me. She always glares at me, never smiles, sighs when I let her know how many people are in my party and lazily walks us to our table. However, every other hostess I have ever come across here is all smiles, courteous and just as friendly as the servers.  A couple bad apples can surely affect business, I know I avoid going to this establishment on certain days due to those specific employees. I have even mentioned something to the General Manager who simply replied, \"That is just who they are.\", with a smile on her face, like it wasn't a big deal and walked away. I was highly shocked, but with her attitude and lack of concern for the company, explains why those couple people act the way they do."}
{"text":"The Arriba Mexican Grill off Bell Road is fantasic, but this location is closer to home so I tried it out.  We sat in the bar area and weren't greeted for about 15-20mins. No big deal, we order our drinks and that takes about another 15 mins to arrive. The server brings drinks to the table next to us and drops the entire tray of drinks and the lady behind me... I'm not talking a little water. The poor lady is covered in drinks. The server immediately apologies and runs off leaving the spilled drinks all over the floor and table. I kid you not that spilled mess sat on the floor for 30 mins before ANYONE came over. No manager came to apologize to the lady right away and all the did was give her a free appetizer! Terrible customer service, the manager addressed the lady as \"the one who got drinks spilled on\". How about you learn some manners, sir!   Anyways, after 50 minutes of sitting there we finally see our server again to take our order. The food came and what do you... it's super crappy tasting! I'll take my $50 for 2 people and go else where... like the Bell Rd location. This place sucks, so bad."}
{"text":"If you love spicy food this is the place for you. I always feel like a get great service everytime I come. I bring my family often because We always enjoys the food, spirits, and service."}
{"text":"Maragarita's as big as your head.  Spicy, affordable food. Convenient locations thorughout the valley.  Only woarning is to not go on Sundays.  KIDS EAT FREE on Sundays and apparently that equals, parents don't have to pay attention to how annoying or obnoxious their kids are being."}
{"text":"If you like it hot, this is your place. It is a bit pricier then other Mexican restaurants but the portions are large and don't taste like it was frozen and just warmed up... cough, cough Macayos! Great specials on the happy hour menu. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere and the hatch chilies are their staple. The salsa is great and the bean dip is a nice change with the chips."}
{"text":"I will NEVER eat at this location again!!!!   My daughter and I were eating our chips and salsa waiting on our food and a giant cockroach fell from the ceiling onto our table. My daughter screamed and I grabbed my purse and we ran to the front of the restaurant. We waited for a few minuets as even though we didn't receive our food yet I still didn't want anyone chasing me down in the parking lot. Finally a woman who I am not even sure was the manager came over knowing what had just occurred and didn't even apologize. She wanted to know if we wanted to sit somewhere else........UH HELL NO!!!  All she had to say was they had already called Orkin....Oh...and you know....it's summer.....Well it's summer at my house too and I don't have Roaches falling from my ceiling!!!!  This was no big deal to them. Clearly they must have an issue and this must be an everyday occurrence. GROSS!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The MAIN REASON I'm doing this review is to recognize a WONDERFUL WAITRESS named LETTY! She is ALWAYS on her A game! She is super efficient, very organized and comes at just the right times. She remembers us and knows what we get. She is very friendly and even when this place is busy, she never forgets to please every table she is serving. We never leave here disappointed when she serves us. I can't say that for the other servers! I had a girl named Maritza or Marcela I think and she left us dry while flirting with a table of guys 2 tables away! Very disappointing and it wasn't the first time she's helped us.  And for Lara, we've had her several times. Today was the worst, hence this review and why it's necessary! She forgot to place my order so my family got their orders except for me, on time anyway. She was helping a table of 8 and it's not even busy in here! The manager is friendly and every time she sees us she comes over to say hi.  Other than these two who have ruined our experiences here, the food is still good. The price is right. And if your lucky to get LETTY then you have a great experience here."}
{"text":"We went here because we were looking for another restaurant and couldn't find it. The parking was a little weird. We accidentally got on the highway trying get into the parking lot.  To start, the hostess a flat out cunt. I honestly think calling her a bitch would be giving her credit.  The server didn't arrive at the table for close to five minutes. The complimentary chips and salsa/dip didn't arrive until after he took our order for nachos. He recommended we try the new New Mexico Red Chili sauce on our food with chopped chilies if we like spicy food. We took the bait. I'll admit, the niceness of the server almost redeemed the cunt hostess.  The food was bland, however spicy and not bad, but not good either. We drove way out of way to find a restaurant we couldn't find and ended up here instead. Needless to say we won't be returning. The cunt at the front door and the food left a bad taste in my mouth. The server is the only reason I give Arriba a second star."}
{"text":"Food was ok, Would of had a better experience if the big black roach wasnt making his way up the wall behind my sister. When we told the waitress about the roach she went and killed it with a napkin and then asked us....that didnt ruin anything for you guys did it???"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  After making a reservation for 2:30 we were told they were busy and we would have to wait for a table. We were offered a table in the dining room but were told it would still be a small wait, we wanted to watch the playoffs so asked how much longer if we split into the two open booths. The general manager Allyson Howell then stepped in and said there would be a wait do to the big party just sat. I asked how long she said 10min, we said that's fine we would wait. We were sat about 10min later. The server came to one table but not our other. After waiting awhile we asked to talk to the manager which was Allyson Howell. We said we had been waiting and she said, I told her (pointing to me sitting at the other table) that there would be a wait. I replied yes a wait to be seated not to be served. That clearly made her upset and she said back I told you you would be waiting. I once again stated why did you seat us then. She then said if you like you can leave. Really? I'm being asked to leave because you are backed up? Mind you I am there with my sister and brother in law, our 3 kids, and my husband. My sister said to her is this really how you are treating your customers as the manager? She said all of you get up and leave now. So now I ask for a refund of a gift card I purchased for the prior week. She refused and said we must leave restaurant. At this point she left to the back of the restaurant. I had asked to speak to her again since our party had left. The server said she would not come back out or give us her managers name. My sister and I eat here every Monday. When I call to order to go the employees know my name by what I order, this is how often we come here and have never been treated this way!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, friendly people, accommodated a family member with a service animal and were very nice and attentive! Excellent food, great flavors, fabulous margaritas"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and food was decent but poorly managed and horrible service. We got there at 4pm on a weekday and it was not busy at all. Servers were standing around and we sat for at least 15 minutes without anyone coming to our table. Our server showed up took our order and disappeared again until we flagged her down for our check. Would not be back"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant just a few days ago.  We were very pleased at the service, the food, and the price.  I have really been surprised at some of the reviews for this restaurant on Yelp, as our experience seems to have been better than some others have had.  I got cheese enchiladas, which came with rice and beans, and it was delicious!  The chips were fresh and the salsa was not bad.  The menu is packed full of New Mexico style mexican food, so you should expect that.  I am new to Arizona, and this will be a place I definitely want to go back to.  I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews on here, but we were more than satisfied with the food, and the staff was very nice and prompt.  We give it four stars and recommend you give it a try.  (And stay away from El Palacio, in Chandler, as we ate there tonight and it was horrible.  I have another review for that place)."}
{"text":"Lame service, lame food.  Our server admitted on several occasions, while taking our order, that she was simply just not paying attention.  \"I'd like the blah blah blah with a side of blah and--\"  \"Oh wait what??  I was totally not even, like, paying attention!  Sorry!  Could you, like, repeat your order??\"  Not even kidding.  I was a server for a very long time, this is simply unacceptable!  Then the food came out, very lack-luster.  Nothing exceptionally bad, but not even good.  I grew up in Phoenix, I know good Mexican food, this is NOT it.  It gets more than 1 star because my margarita was strong.  I will NEVER go back there again.  If in the East Valley, I will take my business to a Fili-B's before I step foot in this Arriba's again."}
{"text":"Food here has always been amazing but over the years it seems they've fired their cleaning staff who gets all the stickiness off the menus and the seats, and hired chefs who can't even produce a truly cooked tortilla. Disappointed."}
{"text":"This is our last visit to this location...once again, very sketchy, slow service, while being made to feel like we were an imposition upon our servers' time. Food was just ok, while our 3 year old got the $4.99 kids meal of mac and cheese with fries...Kraft mac and cheese. Yup...and when the grub finally showed, it was only warmish. And how long does it really take to get the check after saying we are ready to go? Long enough to write this amazing review, apparently. We have never had an experience like this at the location on Camelback, so that is why we gave this place a last shot. One star, just because the burrito had a bit of heat and flavor."}
{"text":"Husband and I loved this place when we first moved here but the service, food, and cleanliness has completely declined. The hostess that seated us \"Alex\" was either having a really terrible day or just really hated us the minute she saw us. My husband is never one to complain so when he said to me that she was acting like a b**ch I was glad it wasn't just me. We walked in around 630 pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't even busy. At first no one was even at the front counter to greet people. Then when \"Alex\" did finally come she stared at us like we were an inconvenience for her and my husband said 2 please and her response was 10 mins is the wait. So my husband goes to the bathroom I sit down in the waiting area and she calls out not even a minute later our name and looks around like there is a ton of people waiting when I was the only one sitting there so I get up and say yep that's us and she tells me to follow her and then I get a command of \"sit here\" and then she walks away. The rest of the night she kept walking by us with this annoyed look on her face. I felt bad and angry because it was my husband's birthday and he was really looking forward to coming here. I guess we will have to take our business to the one in Goodyear and hope for better customer service."}
{"text":"This was a nice little mexican restaurantt.  Had good food.  Menus were large and plentyful.  Price was reasonable.  Staff was friendly.  Can't really complain about it."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place, two out of the 4 plates that we ordered were not that great. The chips and salsa were good and so were our drinks. One plate we ordered was a burrito and very dry, the 2nd plate was a chile relleno and it was mostly cheese and grease. I think it has potential and could be great if the cooking was changed up a little bit. Our server was great even though it was a bit of a wait before he got our order."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place!!! The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all awesome in my book. I had the chicken fajitas, whatever it is that they season their onions and peppers with is by far the best I have had in a very long time!!! I can not wait to go back and try all of their other amazing looking dishes. I recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location two times, the first time I believe they had only been open a week, so the service was so so.  The second time the server was very attentive and friendly.  There chips were fresh and not to salted like some others are. They give you bean dip which is bland to me, but the salsa was good, not loaded with cilantro.  I had the trio of enchiladas(chicken,cheese, and beef) beans and rice.  The enchiladas were good I really liked the red sauce it had a good flavor.  My husband got the tacos carbon after realizing he missed there Taco Tuesday special (it ended at four pm).  His steak on the tacos had a good flavor but were a little dry.  Overall we enjoyed our meal.  I've eaten at many mexican restaraunts, and you could do a lot worse then Arribas."}
{"text":"My Finance and I have gone to Aribas for the last year at least once a week. . . Until now. This restaurant is making us deathly ill!!! It seems like their supply for chicken must be contaminated be because last Sunday it made me sick, and tonight we are both sick again. Stay away from this restaurant, do NOT get this sickness!!!! It is no fun!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to drink margaritas $2 during happy hour. Sarai was awesome she kept them coming."}
{"text":"Absolute horrible service. 16 minutes on hold to place order to go. Food took 20 minutes longer on top of the 15 minutes I was told it would take after I paid of course. Called in to talk to manager once we got home as food was wrong and cold. Hung up on after waiting on hold for 20 minutes. Called back and placed on hold again. Drove to the restaurant and walked in the lobby still on hold only to find all the hostesses standing around. Got nothing but attitude from them as they knew they were guilty of purposely putting someone on hold to talk to the manager because they didn't bother to check an order before it went out the door to make sure it was right. After finally speaking with the manager and explaining what happened they only took exactly what was missing and what I brought back in with me off the bill despite all the inconvenience. No gift card, no let's make this right, nothing.  The female manager we spoke with was great however JD was a complete waste of time. Don't waste your time at this location. All the other Arriba's I've been to In The Valley are good however it seems by the reviews on this place this is a theme. Will never be back"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to go!  They have stopped brewing their tea and now use the fountain tea. Yuck!  We have also noticed that they are now watering down their salsa and bean dip.  The service is usually good - just wish that they would go back to quality tea and salsas!"}
{"text":"The hostess was really nice and friendly but as soon as we sat at are booth are waitress was so rude you can tell she just hated her job.. She took forever to come take are order . I ordered the taco salad with chicken (special order) asked for no tomato or onions. Food comes out really fast and I start mixing the salad a little bit I notice a couple tomatoes no big deal... eat a little bit more a whole layer of tomatoes ( even told her please make sure there is no tomatoes or onions ). She checks on Us once and i mention the tomatoes and I show her the plate of tomatoes I have now all she could say In the biggest attitude was I'm sorry We get done eating and we don't see are waitress again for 20 minutes she is no where to be found she finally showed up with are check and makes a comment by saying she tried to prices are things the best she could and then proceeds to say \"homeboy is hungry this is a lot of food\" .. (she is referring to my boyfriend)  like really you are basically calling him fat -_- RUDE! defiantly going to be a while till I go back"}
{"text":"We love going to this restaurant for lunch or dinner.  The chips, margaritas and food are Deliciouso'"}
{"text":"The meal starts with some really good chips served with a selection of 3 different salsas and a bean dip.  But, that's as impressive as it gets.  The main plates are more about quantity over quality and I felt like the prices were high compared to similar restaurants.  The service was fine, but I just wasn't taken with the food and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I had my mom's surprise 60th birthday party at Arriba in Goodyear on Saturday, October 1.   I rented the patio and had about 30 guests.  Everything was great!  The food was wonderful as always, and the service was outstanding!  When I arrived to start decorating, the patio was set up exactly how I wanted and the staff was so accommodating with my last minute requests.  I would like to say THANK YOU to LaRae, Damon & Rana!  They were a pleasure to work with during the planning process and especially the day of the party!!"}
{"text":"I normally love Arribas however this particular location has terrible customer service. My husband and I were sat, then 15 minutes later we were still waiting. No chips, no drink order, nothing. Meanwhile there were four employees lingering at the hostess station laughing with their phones out. I overheard the people behind us complaining about the service.  We walked out, the group at the hostess station didn't notice."}
{"text":"We used to love this place. We would get the nachos, .99 margaritas and split an entree. It's gone downhill so much. The food is now disgusting, service is horrible and the place is filthy. It smells like a toilet. Next time you're in a booth at the bar, look at the corrugated metal."}
{"text":"On the weekends, Arribas is the best kept secret in Gilbert for breakfast.  You can't beat the Bacon and Eggs for $5.99 http://www.arribamexicangrill.com/imx/menu_items/breakfast/breakfast3_big_r1_c1.jpg  Two eggs, two strips of some the best country style bacon you've ever had served with country potatoes and two buttermilk pancakes.  My wife swears by the Huevos Rancheros Stacker.    While Denny's and IHop are backed up outside with standing room only to wait 30-45 minutes, Arribas usually has no waiting mostly because people don't think of them for breakfast (weekends only), However, even with breakfast, they greet you with free chips, salsa and the best bean dip in town.  Relaxing mariachi music playing in the background in a relaxed Mexican Cantina setting to start your weekend off right. They also brew several of their own beers including a really fine tasting Pilsner that goes great with Cardinals games! http://www.arribamexicangrill.com/microbrews.php  If you have kids, they have a deal for kids under 10 on Sunday with a parents meal.(Check the menu or call the restaurant for details) http://www.arribamexicangrill.com/breakfast_menu.php  All in all a great weekend breakfast!"}
{"text":"After waiting 10 minutes for our server to approach our table on a very slow Tuesday night we ordered our drinks and entrees. My husband a taco salad and I wanted to try something new so I went with fajitas. Whenever I see fajitas coming out they are engulfed with steam and you can hear them coming, well not my order it was barely hot. The beans tasted canned and guacamole was awful. We have been going to the one in Phoenix and Scottsdale for years and always loved it. It seems like the food and service is going downhill fast!"}
{"text":"On a scale of 1-10 , 10 being great , this place gets a 3.   Food is not good , location and interior decor are good.  I will not be returning ..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before, and it's never been great, but NEVER has it been this bad.   The first thing I want to mention, is that I have very little tolerance for heat. As in, their regular salsa that comes with the chips is on the 'just-a-bit-to-warm' side.  Started the night with mini-chimis. These were OK texture wise, but a small dip into the sour cream obliterated all pretense of flavor.  My Grande Margarita arrived sans alcohol. I didn't order a virgin, but there was either no alcohol in it or so little that there was no sign of buzz on a 6 hour empty stomach.  I ordered the Carne Asada, which normally comes with salsa and hatch chilies. I asked for them to hold the hatch, however a few bites into it - when it finally came out -  the intense heat hit me. I rolled back the cheese on top to see a healthy serving of hatch underneath. Yeah, no. Half my virgin Grande Margarita later and the heat finally started to subside. To boot, the steak had been boiled and over cooked. When we informed the waiter, he was very apologetic and removed it from the bill.  My partner ordered the white sands chimichunga with a side of hatch. (yeah he's a heat nut) Since it's fried and smothered with sauce, it was fairly obvious that it had been sitting awhile given it's sogginess, lack of temp and the beginnings of film on the cheese.  My son's grilled cheese and fries were hot. (painfully hot actually)  The waiter was nice but food was poor and service was very slow, which is why I'm listing at 2 stars.  If you MUST have Arribas, spend the gas and head to the one in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I am boycotting Arriba's.  Why the two star review?  I love the food and the attention to flavor in all of their dishes.     The Food:  * * * * (four stars) The Abiance -* -* (negative two stars... yes, the ambiance is that bad after the closure of the patio)  Why am I boycotting Arriba's?  I need to yell, so pardon the ALL CAPS .   MEXICAN FOOD IN THE PHOENIX AREA IS DESERVING OF A FREAKING PATIO DURING THE WINTER SEASON!  They had an awesome patio on which my wife and I would sit on two to three times per week, drink margaritas, I'd have my chile verde burrito with charro beans and just sit there in Sonoran heaven.  BUT THE FREAKING BONEHEADS ENCLOSED THE PATIO!  THE INTERIOR OF THE RESTAURANT IS DARK, REEKS OF DIRTY MOP WATER AND IS DANK!!!!  The patio was the best thing, besides the food, that Arriba's had going for it because it was relaxing, awesome for a leisurely early evening dinner and for post-meal cocktails.  I haven't been back since after I discovered that they enclosed the patio.  :-( :-( :-(  ROOKIE MOVE, guys. :-( :-("}
{"text":"Very poor service when we went in. It wasn't very busy but we waited after being seated,  and waited  patiently, until my hubby got up and went to the restroom and saw three servers and a manager just standing around and came back to the table to find  a server STILL hadn't come by we decided to leave  When a server waited on a table near us and left without saying a word to us, it's pretty bad.  There's a story for each side,  but I don't know what theirs would be cause they were slow enough to have people stand around.  We went down the road to Macayos. Much much better experience."}
{"text":"Terrible queso. Do not order it. The service was very slow and food took forever to come out. It was decent when it came, but we couldn't enjoy it due to the wait."}
{"text":"After reading the previous reviews I had to check it out myself.  I was craving Mexican and this was close by.  I was skeptical.   I walked in and was greeted promptly and I sat at the bar, as I was dining alone.  Was served chips, salsa and bean dip, complimentary.   Both were great!  Food was really good.  Service was amazing.  Dominic, the manager, personally introduced himself to me and made sure I was satisfied.  Hillary the bartender took good care of me since I was dining alone. She made sure that I got plenty of attention, and took her time to explain some of their dishes to me.  I had the enchiladas and they were amazing.  The house margarita is 24 ounces and only $6!  Very tasty and hit the spot to cool off my mouth from the spicy sauce on my enchiladas.    I would bring friends and family here anytime.  Pork green chili is soooo good!!! Yum!!!  I recommend giving it a try.  Sounds like they are under new management and I am literally shocked at the difference I experienced vs the previous reviews."}
{"text":"This Mexican grill stands out from several others in the Goodyear area.  The menu has several unique Mexican items and includes much more than typical enchilada, tacos and burritos.  I like to try different Mexican cuisine and recently tried the Carlsbad stuffed chicken.   It was a unique dish I had not previously encountered.   Two backed chicken breasts with fajita fillings between them smothered in a great cheese sauce.  Served with rice and choice of beans the entrée was huge and was almost more that I could eat.   My wife had the Peco enchiladas stuffed with chicken and sour crème.  They were large, overhanging the rather large plates.  We usually do not do desert but chose to try the Double Chocolate Chimis served with mint a very large scoop of mint chocolate ice crème and generous whipped crème.   This desert was only $5.99 and was more than enough for two of us.   Had we had this in San Francisco it would have cost at least $25.   The food was great, plentiful and the atmosphere and décor of the dining rooms was very well done.  I was very impressed and pleased and will definitely  return.  (The house margaritas were very fairly priced also)."}
{"text":"The older lady bartender had 2 other guests and was primarily interested in talking to her co-worker at bar.  I ordered the beef and chicken combo fajitas. The beef was beef in namely. Disgusting dry shriveled up pieces of sorta beef. It's not like these fajitas were cheap either. They were like 14 bucks! Apparently their 99 cents Margs don't contain any tequila. Don't bother with this rip off of a place"}
{"text":"My nachos looked good but they were not good. My nachos were cold :-(. Everyone was friendly and attentive but the food was a waste of time & a waste of money I would have been better off eating at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This is the typical Mexican restaurant that serves Americanized Mexican food. Food was decent and would probably give it four stars but my waitress didn't understand English that well and my order came out wrong.  Steak fajitas were good but nothing. Special. Cool atmosphere and affordable prices"}
{"text":"YUMMY................ Polla Con Queso"}
{"text":"Go here for the happy hour...$1 margaritas!! M-F 3-7pm & 9pm - Close  Tortillas and salsa: good, you get 3 types of dips Food and service was ok...nothing too spectacular  Decor is cool but it is quite dark in here making it sometimes difficult to read the menu.   Would def go back and sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend  this wonderful Mexican  restaurant the only one I go to when I have the cravings for Mexican food and I sure would invite my friends to come with me as I know they won't be disappointed this is a great place I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I arrived at 9:10PM last night (4/24/13) with my husband.  There were 3 cars in the very dark parking lot.  We then went inside and waited and waited.  We saw a young man in the back and then he disappeared never looking our way. After several minutes of waiting, we left. Why state you're open until 10PM, if there isn't any one up front to seat you at 9:10PM?"}
{"text":"Food was pretty bland. Had cheese enchilada, beef taco, chicken taco and cheese crisp with beef. No real flavor to any."}
{"text":"This place was horrible from the moment we sat down. The only thing that was good was the chips and salsa.We were there on a Sunday noonish and it was not too packed our server only had one other table. There were 5 of us and only 1 set of silverware and had to ask about 6 times for extra silverware and napkins! Our drink order took forever to come however our food came out right away! All I can say is the microwave was not working right because most of our food was really hot on the edges and cold in the middle! Also after asking several times only two of us ever got our drinks refilled! The waitress also kept stacking our dirty dishes up at the end of the table and never took any of them away!  One person in our party also ordered desert, mini-apple chimmi's with ice cream, they're were 4 total and two of them were ICE cold and the other two were hot but cold in the middle! It had been awhile since my wife and I had been to this location before and had good memories of good food and service! Doubt we will return to this place again!"}
{"text":"Hello, I just went into your Phoenix location on Chandler Blvd. about an hour ago. I ordered a chicken quesadilla as part of my order, to-go. I got home and there was no chicken in the quesadilla. I called the restaurant to inform them of this. I was told I had to bring the food in in order to get a replacement. I went out of my way to go to this location, so I was far. I asked if I could get a rain check for tomorrow and the manager said no. I have a picture to prove that I wasn't lying I'd like to send you for proof. I believe your management staff were not cordial or understanding. It is bad service to do this without giving the customer the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Never will I come back. Gave this place a second chance and the service was WORSE than the first time! I sat there my second time for 15 minutes plus with NOTHING to drink TWICE! Literally NOTHING. Had to ASK both times for something to drink while the manager chatted with other patrons about how this wasn't a busy night for them. Service was awful both times and worse the second. I highly discourage anyone from going here."}
{"text":"Went for lunch this afternoon. I got the Tuesday lunch special. Two ground beef tacos rice and beans. All for $4.99. Great price for as much food as I got."}
{"text":"Tried the fish tacos and they were delicious!  Service was also very good tonight!"}
{"text":"I use to always come here when visiting from Chicago.  This last couple times I came here the service was terrible.  The most recent time we had to wait 15 mins for a table when there were plenty available, ok maybe short staff.  When we got to the table they took our order pretty quick.  We noticed two waitresses on their cell phone texting while we were eating.  It took forever to see our waitress again.  It was very cold inside, we should have eaten outside.  There are plenty of good places to eat in the area when I'm here.  Now I freed up a spot on my food agenda for next time.  No more chances with this place."}
{"text":"Heard this place had the best pozole in Phoenix and it did not disappoint!  A little small, but the right amount of kick.  Homemade flour tortillas were great and we added a side of jalepeno bacon.  Very tasty.  Price just a bit high."}
{"text":"I went here to check it out and have the microbrewed beer, and I'm just glad my stomach still works. They have to have the worst beer I have ever had in my life, and I have had over 190 different bottles of beer. I had the pilsner, and I knew from the start that it was going to be terrible. It came as a cloudy medium dark gold color. Pilsners are supposed to be light gold, clear, and crisp. This was the exact opposite, and I thought of it as a confused hefeweizen.  After I mangaged to choke that down, I tried the amber ale. The color was pretty good, so I was hoping this would be better. NEGATIVE. It had no aroma, and when I went to taste it, it tasted just like the pilsner. I had my girlfriend try both the beers too, she also agreed with me.   Bottom line, don't ever try the beer there."}
{"text":"A typical chain restaurant. In the city of Phoenix, there are way better Mexican places that are not chains. I would go elsewhere.  DO NOT GET THE MICROBREW BEER!!! I had the Pilsner and the Amber, and they both tasted the same. I have consumed over 190 different bottles of microbrewed beer, and I was stunned to see that a pilsner tasted the same as the amber. Also, the pilsner was cloudy, which is the opposite of what a pilsner should be. Pilsners are clean, clear and crisp with a thin body. The pilsner I had could be described as a confused Hefeweizen."}
{"text":"Who knew that Arriba brewed its own beer?  When I walked in, I immediately noticed a growler in a display case.  Looking around a bit more, I found a room with steel tanks and brewing equipment.  Arriba offers 3 homemade brews.  I had the Pilsner and it was so-so - not worth taking a growler home.  Still, I'm intrigued enough that I *might* go back just to try the other two.  The food is okay.  At least the place is kid friendly.  It's hard to go wrong with quesadillas and the kid's menu has several options that appeal to children.  I like spicy food but didn't find that here.  Even the \"spicy\" salsa failed to live up to its name."}
{"text":"I have been to different locations and this location is always the worst. The food Arriba serves is good but if you modify anything they will get it wrong. The service here is incredibly bad (I have worked for at least a dozen restaurants) from the hostess, servers, bartenders to the managers. The service is so slow and I never see anyone hustle. The queso fundio and fajita quesadilla (hot!) are great."}
{"text":"Good food but don't show up after 9pm. The entire staff is focused on the clock. Instead of enjoying dinner your in their way."}
{"text":"Had a lunch special - 2 ground beef tacos, rice and beans.  Ehhh - taco bell type tacos, beans were okay, rice was good.  Probably would have been better had we ordered off of the menu instead of the lunch special.  Waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for good New Mexican food! ! Exceptional service, GREAT DRINKS! !"}
{"text":"Our first trip there, it felt like a humid jungle inside. Bartender forgot to put sour mix in my husband's margarita. Second trip there, we didn't even get to be seated...Any place that won't let you bring in a Happy Meal from McDonalds for your picky eating kid, just lost a customer. Ridiculous !!"}
{"text":"Arribas is me and my hubbys 'place' :) the staff is friendly, the food is yummy (not authentic Mexican but very delicious), the price is reasonable and the place is clean including their restrooms."}
{"text":"I have eaten at arriba several times over the last few years and its usually the same.first of all,I don't know how the hostess even still has a job.she's rude,never smiles or says hello when you walk in.she just looks you up and down and says \"how many?\" In a monotone voice.when its always just me and my boyfriend.what are you blind?then she always no matter what, manages to seat you directly next to the table with screaming kids and babies even when the restaraunt is empty.and she always picks the smallest most cramped 2seater in the house.I understand if it's busy that it's her job to seat according to the flow of the restaraunt,but even when it's dead she does this.we have to ask to switch tables everytime we go there.and no,I have never done anything to piss her off.don't even know her.I just recognize her cuz she's been there forever.anyhow the food is usually pretty good.the bean dip is excellent.the service usually always sucks though.you have to wait forever for drinks and refills even when its not busy.I did actually have 2 good severs there once and was impressed,but usually when I go,I expect bad service.there's even worse service at the bar.I've actually have sat down,got ignored and had to say \"hey can I get a drink\"again,it was not busy,so no excuse.the bartenders always too busy watching t.v. to acknowledge you.also,most of the servers look like heroin junkies.no lie,missing teeth and everything.no wonder the turnover rate is so high.but I will say the foods not bad."}
{"text":"I've  Lived in the Phoenix area since 1977 and have tried many Mexican food restaurants all over the country. If you want some great Mexican food, you'll need to try Arriba's. Once you sit down, you'll get tasty, hot tortilla chips, flavorful salsa and bean dip. My husband & I normally order a carne asada burro, chicken con queso, chicken burrito and cheese crisp. Everything is made to order, so if don't like green or red sauce, you are good to go. I like their chicken dishes because the chicken has flavor and is not mushy. I hate going to a Mexican restaurant  & find their salsa is a can of tomato sauce & some red pepper flakes - you won't find that here! We go to Garcia's (marginal) amd my kids like Casa Reynoso (I'd rather eat dirt!) and I hate that I waste my money at these so-called \"authentic Mexican\" restaurants when you can find much better food! Give Arriba's a try! We go to the Arriba's in Chandler at least once per month and have always had great service."}
{"text":"Typically I don't like to write negative reviews, just because I grew up working in a family restaurant as well as worked for other chains. My experience tonight was very unpleasant. My girlfriend and I came in and we hadn't realized they had changed their hours, so in advance being there 30 min before they closed I get it. My bean dip came out ice cold, I asked for them to warm it up, our waitress grabbed it and brought it back and just kind threw it. Also, didn't get any refills on any of my drinks and I did order a appetizer of fundido dip and well it came out slightly warm/room temperature. The chorizo on the top was cold and hard as a rock. She didn't even ask us how everything was so far.. The chips were also just cold and very chewy they weren't cooked fully. My dinner, came out well room temperature/warm. My girlfriend meat was cold, looked like it had been hanging out on their grill in the back. When I walked into the establishment it was very humid, and like I said originally I'm pretty good and reasonable when it comes to the food industry. Overall, I have been in the same situation before and of course I would be a little bothered but I always gave my best effort and made sure everything was still a pleasant experience as well as the food being up to par when I worked in the industry. We are guests and paying for the food, the least you can do is make sure we are enjoying our dinner ? I was still very polite saying \"thank you\", \"please\", our typical manners we all are shown growing up. She just walked away, dropped things off and tossed them. So plot twist now.... I use to work for the company a couple years ago so I'm well aware of how things are prepared and how the flow is at Ariba's Mexican grill."}
{"text":"Never again. We got to the restaurant at 9pm and sat in the bar area. The waiter acted like they were closing down already, even though they don't close until 10pm. We planned on going for reverse happy hour, but I was still charged full price for the margarita I ordered. I even made sure to ask if it was happy hour. When I ordered my margarita he pointed out that he had already cleaned his bar and washed the blenders so I felt like I couldn't order my drink blended. I could understand if they were getting ready to close but they were still open for another 45 minutes! I felt like I was bugging the waiter anytime I had to ask for something. Terrible service. I won't be back. Oh and whoever said the chips were good... I've never had chips that stale in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Fish taco included a sardine sized piece of fish a lots of Cole slaw and pico. Two obviously production tortilla to finish the taco. Two tbs.  Beans. Good margarita s though."}
{"text":"Not good for vegetarians. They put meat in EVERYTHING. There is nothing like getting a \"vegetarian\" meal to find meat chucks floating in the sauce. In addition, every time I eat there I get sick. Seriously, the chain Mexican food restaurants need to be banned from Arizona. There are so many great authentic Sonoran Mexican food places around town, the chains just ruin it. Unfortunately none of them are by my house, so I am forced to try these crappy chains... When will I ever learn?"}
{"text":"Very POOR Service: We just left Arriba's my wife and I sat at the bar for 20 minutes I asked the manager if the bar was open and with the attitude tells me he was taking care of a customer that he'd be right with me so my wife and I left. I will say the Arrowhead Arriba's staff is very good."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Waiter refused to place my appetizer while he was taking drink orders. I placed an order for the queso and never received it. I then ordered to fish tacos which were horrible. After about 30 mins after leaving I began to become very sick. I definitely received food poisoning. If you want to have the worst service and food come on in!"}
{"text":"I was craving fajitas for lunch and figured I would try Arriba to go.    So to start with the good - the staff was friendly and I did not wait long for my food.  That's about it.  The bad - I ordered the Santa Fe Fajita Salad which cost $12.99 (including tax).  The salad was not inedible but it certainly was not a $12 salad.  The Salad portion was what appeared to be bagged iceberg lettuce salad (the kind with carrots and red cabbage).  The meat was ok but rather bland and the guacamole was clearly turning brown.  There were hardly any peppers or onions to speak of and one large piece of onion turned out to be the thick, impossible to chew, piece of onion skin.  My food was bagged not boxed - in a bag the was puffed up with air in order to keep the bag from lying directly on the food.  Only after I started to eat my food did I realize how this might have been achieved and I tried not to imagine an employee blowing all over my food to inflate the bag. Unfortunately that thought was too much and I set the rest of my overpriced salad aside.  Also don't expect a fork or napkins in your to go order if you do decide to take your chances.  There weren't any."}
{"text":"I went to Arriba last night with my wife and another couple.  I have been to this location a handful of times and always had the same result.  The food was okay but the main problem here is the super slow service.   It took us nearly two hours to eat dinner here.  It took forever to get our chips and salsa.  It took us nearly as long to get our drinks.  Forget about refills.    When our food finally arrived we asked for an additional plate but never got it.  I asked for a water when our food came out and got it after I was 3/4 done with my meal...and I do not eat fast.  Our waiter was friendly but hardly ever checked in with us.  When we asked for the check he said he would bring it in five minutes.  His five minute deadline was not met.  I don't think I will be eating here again.  I have given them too many chances."}
{"text":"I must have had the best food on fri night..best server..I forgot to ask his name dark hair  maybe Eric??I asked to have a take home box  ..He even brought a small container for the really good salsa.."}
{"text":"We arrived about 8:30pm. Blake was our server. He was very friendly and efficient. The biggest thing my husband and I are searching for is a nice Mexican place where we can east chips, cheese dip and salsa. This is the second place we have tried in the Gilbert/Phoenix area...all I can say is try , try again. My husband's comment was \"this is the worst enchilada I've ever had.\" The burrito was just very bland, as was the salsa(the salsa is hot also). The place is not horrible, its just plain and flavorless. Another server who had overheard our conversation suggested for the best queso and salsa...\"your house. Seriously, homemade salsa and queso is not going to be topped.\"  Oh well....we will keep trying."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I never take the time to wright reviews this is the second one I have ever done. The service for the evening started out very well for the decent sized group that we had. It was busy in the restaurant for a Friday night but we got our order with in a decent time. Now after that is when things changed. The first thing I noticed, but was ok with was the price of the food for what you got. I ordered the carnitas and it tasted good but the amount of food was pitiful for the size of the plate it was on. It was mostly garnish and decorations. After we were done eating we stayed to talk and have drinks for probably about an hour and no one came by our table to pick up our plates or offer to get us anything else. Our table was packed with dirty dishes. So after an hour I final flagged down a waiter to get some help with picking up the table and to order desert. At this time of the evening the restaurant was pretty empty so no excuses in my mind. It took another twenty minutes to get our desert and they still hadn't cleared the table. We asked for the check at this point. Our group had two items removed from our bill that were mistakes and our waitress could not get her computer to divide the check with items being removed so she handed us the check to figure out who needed to pay for what. This is when it got even worse, we look at the check for the first time to see what we owe and the bill was like if an army of 20 people just ate dinner. They charged us for every scoop of sour cream and guacamole that they never told us would be extra, and didn't remove what they said they would from the bill. I could go on and on. It took another 45 minutes just to get the bill correct only to pay a little more than half of what they originally charged us. They cleared the table while we figured out the bill finally ten minutes before we left. One of the worst services I have ever received."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Can be short staffed which leads to longer wait times but once you're seated servers are pretty quick. Delicious if you're looking for New Mexico food."}
{"text":"Spicy hot is a very subjective thing. Arriba's dishes are made with Hatch chilis from New Mexico. For the lightweights, they have a heat scale next to the chili items. They can't make their food too hot  for me. Everything I've had here has been good. Service is usually good, but have had a couple of issues with the service in the past. I've been to the Chandler and Scottsdale locations."}
{"text":"It's sad to witness the demise of this formerly great Mexican restaurant.  We had stopped going to the Camelback location over a year ago, after the food quality took a nose dive, and we saw baited mouse traps in the dining room.  Thought we'd give it another try with family new to the Valley- this visit was the last nail in the coffin.  Bad service, waitress didn't know how to pre-bus our table when subsequent courses arrived- several un bussed tables sat for over an hour near us.  Not sure what happened to this chain, but it's really a shame- RIP Old Arriba."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here for a late lunch. We were seated promptly and the waitress that served us was attentive and nice. The food was not very good, though. I doubt that I will return."}
{"text":"Well tonight was our last night of visiting this establishment. I moved here in 2006, and up until now this has been my favorite(!) Mexican restaurant. I'm talking birthdays, celebrations, anniversaries- this was the place. But no more. For the last couple of years, service has gone downhill, and shows no sign of improving. Tonight was the final straw. Yes, it is Friday night. Yes, it was at the end of happy hour. Taking all this into consideration, it was awful. The server was clearly in a hurry, and when we werent ready to order immediately, she showed a little attitude. She did say she would be serving us with another server helping- although she was the only one that came to the table. My husband ordered a margarita, and while we were merely 15 feet from the bar, took 15 mins to get to the table-AFTER we had to remind her. That was when we next saw her. Then when our food came, it was wrong. She told me she had ordered it correctly, and I believe she did, but it came out wrong and frankly I was afraid if I sent it back, well, I wasn't sure how long that would take. That was not her fault, but after our visits over the last few years being less than desirable, we're calling it quits. Someone needs to fix the FOH, food quality is good, just poor management for quite a while now. Too bad Arriba's, we miss the way you used to be."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times and there food is always amazing.  Along with margaritas for two, they're regular margaritas are delicious.   Chips and dip included."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on Thanksgiving. We go here all the time but won't be back. We have eaten here on holidays before and they have always honored happy hour and lunch specials but not this time. We went there for turkey enchiladas but didn't see a sign advertising them so we ordered something else. After we done eating, come to find out that they did have turkey but never would have known because there was no sign. Salsa was horrible. There was a drunk guy in the bar singing loud and out of tune. They kept serving him beer. Very annoying. Several customers complained. Our server Rebecca was in outer space somewhere and it was obvious that she didn't want to be there. Terrible experience. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Love the New Mexico style food!  Best chili rellenos, salsa, enchiladas since NewMexico! Very nice atmosphere too. Will definitely bring out of towners here for GREAT mexican food."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my grandparents (who are EXTREMELY picky about where they eat) and they absolutely loved it! The costumer service was awesome and we were helped the second we walked through the door, seated immediately, and got our food very soon after ordering. The food was phenomenal as well and I was very pleased with how flavorful my grilled chicken breast was."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years but this last trip was just disappointing. We had a large party (and we called ahead since there were 15 of us.) They basically sat us in the isle to the bathrooms and kitchen.  The poor waiters kept bumping into our chairs to get past us. And the people seated in the booths on the other side of us had to wait for us to stand up so they could get out since it was so tight.  I asked for a drink menu and was told they were revamping it and there wasn't one available, so asked a couple of questions and ordered something.  Didn't receive what I ordered but our waiter was new so figured oh well.  He was also very slow in getting back to us so I got tired of waiting.  Got the bill and the drink was $9.  For a drink...that wasn't what I ordered and had not been told a price on.  Yes, I should have asked. Learn the hard way I guess.  99 cent Margarita would have been better. Service was very slow, food was mediocre at best. Prices seemed very high for the quality of food. Staff was friendly thank goodness."}
{"text":"I will only come here for the house margaritas. I'm not a fan of the food here."}
{"text":"The food excellent and the service was superb. Sara our waitress was very attentive. Thank you for a most enjoyable dining experience!"}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars for this place I would. They have a serious cockroach problem and once the head cook found one in the carnitas and just picked it out, threw it away. I've never lost my respect for such an establishment. The managers are clueless and don't care about the service as they just want too \"chisme\" together constantly. The bartender with the glasses is a rude, pervert who I've seen inappropriately grope on the staff. The day girl bartender has no idea what's she is doing behind the bar, and probably only got the job because she's the managers best friend. If you want to get sick and be served by people who don't give any cares about you then go ahead and be their guest."}
{"text":"I love Arriba Mexican Grill.  I get the White Sands Chimichanga literally every time I eat at Arriba.  The chips and salsas are delicious.  The Pollo Con Queso and Posole are also super tasty.  I go to school in Tucson and every time I come up to Phoenix to visit my family I HAVE to go to Arriba!  Also, since there is no Arriba in Tucson I like that I can purchase jars of Arriba salsa to enjoy while I'm not in Phoenix.  I would definitely recommend that everyone tries Arriba Mexican Grill."}
{"text":"Today was the last time I give this dump my $. Placed a To-go order, had to repeat my order at least 3 times to the moron they placed to answer phone. I only ordered 2 things and when I got home one of them was missing the jalapeno dip that's the center of the dish! Not ok. And the mini chimis I ordered tasted like they were wrapped in uncooked tortilla.  Overall, service is awful. Food quality has clearly declined. And forgetting pieces of a meal is inexcusable when your paying for it ! Never again."}
{"text":"The margaritas and chips and salsa are always perfect. The entrees are not consistent along with the service."}
{"text":"Service is getting pretty bad and going downhill fast. Server today had an attitude, they must be getting them from the women's prison early release program. It seems like we're asking them for a huge favor when we want another margarita. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I like that they give you a bean dip with the chips! I had the enchilada plate which was mediocre but I enjoyed dinning here and I will return to try some other plates."}
{"text":"The server apparently forgot to bring out our appetizer, but he was a nice guy in general and of course removed it from our bill, so no harm no foul. Mistakes happen.  The Hatch Chicken Especial was definitely worth it. The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their meals. The house Amber was also worth trying."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Always the best service & great happy hour. Enjoy $2 margaritas & cheap eats. One of the best hidden Mexican joins around Phoenix. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Muy mas caliente, but my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. It's not swanky, and sometime you can feel like they're rushing your through. But the food is savory and very, very hot."}
{"text":"Our first time here, gotta say the food is great! I got the chimichanga plate and I loved it.. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Went to this location because we were meeting friends from out of town.  I eat to the Camelback location regularly so I thought this was a sure bet.  It was a shocking difference.   The food and service was terrible.  The restaurant wasn't busy, as a matter of fact we were the only table in the section.  Our server was slow, forgot to bring beverages, and our orders needed to be sent back several times because they were incorrect...by a long shot. They weren't even special orders!!   Red beef enchiladas are not the same as green chicken ones. The food they did get right was just terrible.  It literally tasted like canned food which is not what I expect from this restaurant.    The MOD did comp the 2 meals we had to repeatedly send back which was fair because they had to leave before getting their food.   I was still upset about the experience 2 days later and called them to talk to the manager.  He seemed sincere in his apology and offered to refund entire meal.  Well, it's been 5 days and no credit back to my account.  This place is a mess. Try the Camelback location but stay clear of this one!."}
{"text":"Bean dip was a bit on the wild side if you know what I mean; as well as the queso dip. Server forgot the sour cream that I ordered on the side. With that being said, I ordered the Arriba pollo con queso, and let me tell you what, it was delightful. The chicken was tender, juicy, and it was topped with a delicious jalapeño cream cheese. Arriba Mexican Grill has trully achieved something many restaurants stride to obtain, but few ever attain."}
{"text":"I feel terrible that I forgot to do this sooner. My wife and I had dinner here sometime about a week ago and had THE BEST service possible, I hope I'm getting his name right but think his name was Aaron. This awesome server could not have possibly given us better service. Friendly, attentitive, and professional! We will continue to visit this location as everytime we go the food and service are awesome!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for Mexican food. I did enjoy their salsa and bean dip. I had ordered a burrito with rice and beans, with a soda. My tab came up to about $21. Again a bit pricey, but I did enjoy the meal I had with my 2 other girlfriends.   Would I come back here, sure why not, if I'm going for an occasion.   But if I wanted to get my Mexican-food fix...I'd rather go to Filiberto's or some other place."}
{"text":"Awful food and service.  Waiter kept calling me \"chief.\"  Chips are good but food quality and temperature were very poor. Really disappointing"}
{"text":"Great place if you like mushy, soggy, undercooked mexican food.  The tortillas are terrible.  You can find better at frys.  The enchiladas suck. The cheese inside wasnt even melted. The chili relleno plate, my favorite mexican dish, was soupy!  How the hell can chili relleno be SOUPY???  Literally when i was done there was an inch of juice on my plate.  Oh and drink your soda slowly because it will take 30 minutes to get refilled."}
{"text":"Horrible!!  If your still curios, keep reading.  Been to this location on two separate occasions.    First time, soon after they opened.  We were seated in the bar area.  Drinks and chips came out quick and that was the best part of the night.  I had to flag down our waitress several times to get a refill.  Chips weren't refilled.  Although at the door leading to the patio were about 6 of the  \"kids\" that refill drinks and refill chips just standing around not doing a lick of work.  Our dinner took about 1/2 hour to come out, and it was just eghhhh....  i chalked this experience up to grand opening issues.  Waited about 3 weeks before heading back.  This time around it was 9pm on a Saturday night.  Again we were seated in the bar area.  One of the appetizer plates on our table had a thick glob of dried cheese on it.  The hostess took it back and then brought me a \"clean\" plate.  As she approached i saw her scraping something off it.  She dropped it off and and i pushed it to the side and walked over to 3 empty table before i found plates w/ no dried on food on them.  They must have issues w/ their dishwasher albeit human or machine.  We sat there for 15 minutes, in that time, no one ever took our drink order or ever  brought chips or water.  As I looked around, again there were people standing around by the door leading to the patio doing NOTHING....just standing around chit chatting.  At this point i had enough.  As we walked out, i turned around and decided to speak to the manager.   When he finally came out, i told him that we had been there for 15 minutes and no one took our drink order, that he had a staff of people standing at the door doing absolutely nothing.  He kinda of just stared at me w/ a deer in the headlights look.  He never apologized, just stood there looking around.  As you read other posts about this location, you will read about the other service issue.  You would think this place being so new, they would want to hit it out of the park with every customer that walks thru their door.  Save your aggravation and money and head down the street to Manuel's or Macayos!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Arriba's on Chandler and 48th St today for dinner. We've been to Arriba's in the past and have received great service and good food. Today was one of the worst experiences Ive had in any restaurant because of the lack of service from our server. She didn't give us her name and can only be identified as African American and middle aged. She approached us without a greeting and asked for our drink order. When she brought out our salsa we all chimed thank you and she walked away without saying anything. She brought our food over and didn't say a word and not once asked us how we were doing. We had to ask the busser for more beans and a to-go plate because she was nowhere to be found and trust me, it wasn't because it was a busy night. When she came to drop off the check she put it down on the table without even a glance at anyone, as if the sight of us offended her. My family is Asian and my boyfriend is Hispanic and when he went to ask her for a working pen (because she left us one that didnt work) she was kind to him and even called him \"sweetie\". I'd like to think that we progressed more as a society, but in this circumstance it makes me believe that we received such poor service because we were Asian. We were polite the entire time, not complicated, and not loud at all so I don't understand why she treated us so poorly when we came to this place to have a good dining experience. I am hesitant to continue my business at this establishment if this is the kind of people you hire."}
{"text":"I am very surprised at the bad reviews for this place. Me & my husband have been here 3 times & have been very much satisfied with the food. We always get take out so I can't review on the service, but the hostess up front is always nice & cheerful."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me, it wasn't my choice. I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY, especially green chile. When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.  When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said, \"Well, we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican\" and walked off. What?!?!  The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction. I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no. Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation, had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.  I'm far from being a vegetarian, I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it. Also, I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan, maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...  I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.  Iceberg lettuce, slimy greens, cooked onions and bell peppers, mushy tomatoes, half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck.   If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips, guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy.  I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it."}
{"text":"Tried breakfast here, and was not disappointed. I had   Huevos Rancheros Stacker   Two eggs, green chile and corn tortillas, stacked New Mexican style. Served with beans, country potatoes, two buttermilk pancakes and flour tortillas.  And a Strawberry Margarita. Everything was great."}
{"text":"Was so excited about having hatch green chili, turns out, it don't have the same blend and favor like New Mexico's restaurants. So it will be awhile before I go back, sorry."}
{"text":"Personally I used to love coming to this place but it definitely went downhill on the food I got was cold and literally seemed like it was just microwaved. service was good although it definitely could've been better!"}
{"text":"Been sitting at the bar for over 15 min. I have had 3 servers come make drinks for there table without anyone addressing me at the bar. It memorial day and I came here to drink. Horrible mistake. Horrible service. If I could I would shank the owner for being unpatriotic"}
{"text":"I love the hot sauce here and the bean sauce you get with the chips. It's very reasonably priced and the food rocks. I don't think I've ever had anything bad. The wait staff can be a bit slow at times but that's only when really busy. Super friendly too!"}
{"text":"I love the margaritas here! We love going to just relax and have a drink and maybe even watch a game. Salsa and dip were great and ended up asking for multiple bowls of it lol... Our server was great when we took our out-of-town family there and were great working with all 8 of us..including asking for more bean dip :)   The margarita for 2 was very good, not full of mix or too strong.. I will def get this again."}
{"text":"A pick up with many items missing.  Including tortillas for tortillas for fajitas.  Would of been excellent but couldn't drive all the way back for tortillas n sour cream defeats reason we had it pick up"}
{"text":"Horrible food, no way comparable to other mexican restaunrants in the valley.....   Food didn't taste good at all"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place!! ordered a burrito with ground beef. not only was it full of grease it was pink in some areas. I asked for chicken and had it to go. I heated it up and found raw chicken inside. no joke. not only did our waitress not apologize,  either did the manager who brought out my to go food. Should not even be in business."}
{"text":"WOW !!! finally a good Mexican restaurant in AZ ...really? Just good food, with a \"kick\" fast friendly service. We are so happy to finally have a place to eat Mexican food in AZ. We drive all the way from Surprise AZ to this location, worth the trip. Wish they would open one in Surprise! Thanks finally for Mexican food worth eating.!!"}
{"text":"This place has been consistently delicious.   For authentic mexican cuisine (not a on the borders fan) this is the best place for food.   We have had the White sands chimichanga, regular chimichanga, taco plate, the pollos bowl, taco salad, even tried fish tacos once (was not disappointed), green chilli burrito, and all sorts of cocktails and on tap home brewed beers.   The servers are always polite, place is always clean. Food fresh to order and comes out quick.   We have been going to Arriba's as our favorite hmm I want to eat out tonight.   Best by far that the spot is easy to get in, get a bite and get out without too much headache.   Great place for a family get together and trust us the flavors are exceptional.   I've never gotten sick from it, never get sick of the flavors they are able to stuff into their plates, all come with sides of either black, refried, pinto beans, spanish house rice and usually some salad and salsa. Request Guacamole freshly home made for an additonal charge ( it is really delicious) the margaritas and fresh chili smells bring out what is best about this location."}
{"text":"I have been to Arribas only 3 times in the past 3 months and will continue to eat there, I have a flavor for spicy and the  Hatch Chile Sirloin has always been my favorite as well as the chips and dips before the meal. I read some of the other reviews for this restaurant and am surprised how quickly people are to criticize pricing of a soda (free refills) or not liking a free bean dip, I tip based on the customer service I don't bash a company because someone may have had a bad day, I know I'm guilty of not always being on. I just wanted to defend or voice my opinion to these people that think themselves perfect, this is a really cool place to eat."}
{"text":"Posted hours: 10:45am. Doors are locked at 11:15 and no one picks up the phone. Hopefully this means they are out of business because this place has gone so far down hill"}
{"text":"Me gusto mucho !!los meseros muy amables y la comida muy rica con mucho sabor Mexicano un muy buen lugar para unas buenas Margaritas riquísimas y grandes también ..."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I ever had. Decent price. Only down side is that they need s new bartender. Can't really make a good margarita."}
{"text":"If you love micheladas and beer save your money and time. who serves beer over ice!? And if the beer had just a bit more head in it I would have had to buy the bartender dinner. Service was bad to top it off. So If you want high priced Taco Bell and ice in your beer then Arribas Mexican Grill is the spot for you."}
{"text":"So far this is the best Mexican restaurant I have found in the Phoenix area.  Once you are seated you get chips, salsa and bean dip (which is some of the best bean dip I have had at a restaurant)  The rest of the menu is very typical for a restaurant of this style but the do have really good nachos and fajitas"}
{"text":"Tacos al carbon were very good. Our server was on top of it! Nick great job and recommendation. We'll be back whenever in town again."}
{"text":"Today's experience was awful! We used to love coming to Arribas, but today we have decided to go no more...It started with the not so welcoming greeting, followed by the immediate change in language as they discussed who they wanted to attend to first-us who arrived first, or the party of 5. Fortunate for us-not so much for them-we speak Spanish! Next it was the catty sizing up of myself and my 2 teen daughters and the smiles to my husband and 3 sons as we were walking to our seats, followed by the dirty table setting when we were seated (silverware covered in hard caked on food). They brought us all the requested water, and when my 7 year old asked for more water we took the lid off if his kids cup to discover it was filthy! Some kind of dirty black residue was on the inside wall of the plastic cup-I thought this cups were all new??-it was almost like a thin layer of dirt or soot. When we addressed it with out server she looked at it and acted like this was not the first time she had to exchange a dirty dish (not including the afore mentioned spoon covered in hardened food-like shredded chicken). Once the food came it was ok. We used to come to Arribas regularly because the food had great flavor and quality. Not so much today. At one point my daughter had ordered some enchiladas and bit into one to find a bone. Normally I would have let it go but from the time we walked in until then it was such  a bad experience. We told a our new waitress (I think there was a shift change between us being seated and getting out food) and her response? \"Well animals have bones, so\" whith a shrug. We're not dumb. We know they have bones; I guess I was the dumb one for assuming we wouldn't be dining on them. The only good thing about our meal for seven was the happy surprise that kids eat free on Sundays."}
{"text":"While I understand that this is a chain restaurant, I still think there are much better Mexican food places to go to than Arriba.  This was my first experience with Arriba Mexican Grill. I ordered the Chile Colorado. The menu designates this as a 2-chile (fiery) dish and to me it was mildly spicy (1-chile or snappy according to their ratings). I was supposed to get rice, beans and tortillas with this and when it was brought to my table, there were no frijoles negro nor tortillas. I pointed this out to my waitress. She apologized and said that she'd be back with them right away. About 5 min later, she walked by the table with no beans or tortillas in sight and asked her about them again. She forgot.  By the time I got my beans and tortillas, I was done with my dinner!!!  After paying for my meal and going up to the front, I asked to speak to the manager about this horrible situation (I waited to complain to the manager because I didn't want my food tainted by something - seen it done too many times when I worked in a restaurant). I told the tale of experience to the manager and it fell upon deaf, or unsympathetic, ears.  I WILL NEVER EAT, DRINK OR STEP INTO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"I am a first-time visitor to Arriba Mexican Grill. Overall, I was disappointed in the food. I would like less salt (a preservative) and fresher food, with an additional focus on fresh herbs and spices.  Arriba offers complimentary refried beans, salsa, and chips. The chips were okay. The salsa and refried beans were okay.  The waiter brought a sample of pozole (I was excited to see it on the menu), and I decided not to get it as it was way too salty. (While it was disappointing that the pozole was so salty, it was nice that he offered a sample.)  I asked which tacos he suggested for me, street, fish, or Tacos al Carbon. He suggested the Tacos al Carbon at $13.99. He said the meat used was fajita meat. We also had Nachos Supremo ($11.99). My tacos al carbon had nice tender meat, and nice tortillas, nice pico de gallo, lots of iceberg shredded lettuce, lots of shredded cheese. The meat was tender, but way too salty for me. I ate one and had had enough. I ate another as the dish was so pricey and I hated to waste it. I could not eat the last. Overall, this dish was overpriced and lacking in quality. The Nachos Supremo were a generous portion and good (not too salty)... ground beef, pickled jalapeno slices, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, chips.   We finished with a fried ice cream with chocolate sauce. I liked the cinnamon chip in it best. The ice cream was frozen very hard and there was no warmth to the outside coating (I think it was prepared earlier and refrozen). The outside coating was unpleasantly chewy (rather than crisp) and reminiscent of soggy corn flakes. I think Arriba would do better to prepare this item fresh.  The only item I would get again would be the nachos (but I would only go here if someone else with me really, really, really wanted to go). I mentioned to the manager that I thought the pozole and the tacos al carbon were overly salty. She said she would check into it. The waiter later mentioned that we had a discount (it looked to be 20%, which was a nice surprise).   I think many Mexican places have too much salt in their foods. I love pozole and tacos, but without so much salt. They taste fresher to me without all the salt. Most Americans get too much salt in their diets. Maybe this was an anomaly. I hope Arriba considers lowering salt content overall and using more fresh herbs, vegetables, and spices (likely more costly than salt). I also would like to see less shredded cheese and iceberg lettuce and more interesting lettuces...and maybe smaller amounts of more interesting cheeses.   The waiter kept my water glass full which kept me satisfied. He seemed to allow us a leisurely pace and did not rush us. My companion felt he'd forgotten us a bit. He was gone for long periods (perhaps he had a large table area or had side work to do). Overall, service was decent and friendly.  On the way out, I noticed beer brewing vats. I was told Arriba brews their own beer. That sounds interesting.  Hmm...on the way in, the staff at the counter ignored us for a bit, occupied with their thoughts or tasks, perhaps. It would have been nice to have a greeting, followed by something like, \"I'll be with you in a moment.\""}
{"text":"This was the first place my husband to me out to eat out when we started dating, OMG I loved it. The staff is always extremely nice prompt at this location, we enjoy their food and I epically am in love with the 99 cent margaritas they are the best. We always have a wonderful time here new and old memories."}
{"text":"WORT SERVICE EVER!!!!!! I guess it depends on the staff we had been there a few times never had problems the last time we went there the service sucked they even discounted half our bill cause we had to complain so much. We will not waste our time at THIS LOCATION ever again. Try the BELL and ESTELLA PARKWAY locations, they are also very beautiful locations."}
{"text":"Food...it's not the best Mexican in the world but it's pretty good. The portions are generous and everything seems tasty in a good way. Skip the steak fajitas and order a ground beef chimi instead. Kids meals are generous and they always seem pleased. Bean dip w/ salsa is quite good.  Ambiance....it's ok. Nothing to write home but always clean and cool. It can get a little crowded on the weekend.  Staff...for the most part friendly. The manager can get a little too talkative.  Verdict....for the price it's quite good. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Should not even give it one star. My food was undercooked and bland (what I could eat). Our server was rude, disrespectful and completely incompetent. I cannot believe how bad the service was. We waited 20 min for water. We asked for salsa 6 times and had to wait 30 minutes for salsa. Never ever going back.  I warn all of you to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"This was meal one in my 3 day visit and AZ Mexican food tour. I had a lovely dinner with my brother, aunt and uncle at Arriba's.  I wasn't thrilled but here is the lowdown: Chips... 4 stars, they were crisp and warm good salsa and bean dip.  Service  3 stars, the server was informative and friendly but she forgot my uncle's extra hot salsa and he didn't get it until 1/2 way through the meal.  Food 2-4 stars, my green corn tamale was just okay, it was dry and lacked the \"corny\" flavor that I was after.  My uncle really enjoyed his Chile   Decor.. 3 stars, nothing to write home about but okay.  I agree that it didn't seem very clean.  If I have a choice I would choose a single store mom and pop in the future."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my boyfriend on a whim; neither of us had been here before, and he thought it looked good, so I agreed. WOW, was I impressed!! Super nice service, very speedy and efficient. For lunch, I had their spinach enchilada plate with refried or pinto beans and 2 chicken taquitos. The taquitos were pretty good, although not distinguishable from taquitos I have had at other Mexican restaurants. What really blew me away, however, were the beans and the enchilada. SO tasty and fresh, and the flavours can't be beat! I will most definitely be back sometime."}
{"text":"There are better places to get Mexican food here in the valley. GO THERE! The waitress was moody and not helpful... we had to literally take a fork and knife to the salsa to cut up the tomatoes. The quesadillas were awful. They were out of Mexican beer. WHAT!?! They rest of our party was just 'okay' with the food. The food is pricey for what it is. Then... They messed up our bill! It's our second time in. Bc I believe in second chances. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great Service Logan... just move back to Arizona great food great beer great  service"}
{"text":"We have eaten here before and it was decent. This time we placed a to-go order. I was specific on the phone when I placed the order. When I went to pick it up, the gals at the front said that the kitchen didn't understand and gave me too many of the fluatas I ordered, but I would not be charged for them. When we got home to eat the food, most of the order was incorrect - items missing, wrong meat, and wrong type of tacos. Additionally,  I was charged for the \"extra orders\" that the gals said I would not be charged. I called the restaurant and spoke with Ivan, the manager. He was rude and argumentative. After putting me on hold several times, he said that I would \"probably receive a credit\" but he would call me back. He never called back. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Is the food good? Um, not really. Is the happy hour good? No - It's great! Listen,     $.99 Margaritas and half price appetizers is a fabulous deal when you have a large family or are on a budget. And don't forget all the chips and salsa! This probably isn't the place to go when you're looking for authentic Mexican food. However, if you don't want to cook and don't want to spend a ton of money, Arriba's Happy Hour is the way to go!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. The White sands chimi is incredible. Their margaritas are also awesome. The staff is very friendly and on Sunday kids eat free. I'm going again today."}
{"text":"Weekend Breakfast Review Only =  Came here Sunday morning after church and getting complimentary chips and salsa immediatly after sitting down definitely calmed my inner hunger beast.  Next came the coffee, oh the coffee, so delicious with a hint of hazelnut or vanilla, I meant to ask what it was but got too engrossed in my Huevos Rancheros I forgot.  These were definitely some of the best Huevos Rancheros I've had at a restaurant. Beans - good, Potatoes - good, Sauce - delish!  I was so stuffed half way through I had to take a small break to get those delicious looking pancakes in, and they are goooooood pancakes.  Great meal on all levels, the waitress was super nice too, so much good food for the money and so many other delicious looking options on the menu, I will definitely be back, loved it!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've had. Had a chicken chimichanga and it was fantastic. Definitely coming back next time I'm in town from Colorado."}
{"text":"On Friday, I went to Arriba with my wife, mom and young daughter for a mexican dinner.  We were promptly sat, greeted and ordered our drinks.   We ordered guacamole as an appetizer. I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of guacamole that we received.  Always a good start to a mexican meal.  Our food came out within 15 minutes of order. I had the triple enchilada plate. I enjoyed my enchiladas (beef, cheese and chicken). The plate was big and flavorful.  I could have gone for another enchilada!   The most disappointing part of the meal was the rice and beans. The rice/beans didn't have the best taste and easily the most disappointing part of the meal.  Not sure if that is the normal taste or just had an old/bad batch.  Service was very good.    Arriba is very kid friendly and a festive atmosphere.  Not the best mexican food, but slightly above average, close to home, affordable and nice atmosphere. We'll be back for these reasons.  3.5"}
{"text":"If you like your food spicy, you will like Arriba!  I know it is a chain, but it is a local chain, and they are very consistent!  They have the best spinach enchiladas around....they are amazing!  I also love that they give you bean dip and two different kinds of salsas with your chips.  The menu has pictures of everything, which makes it very hard to choose, but I usually stick to a few of my favorites.  They also have really good lunch deals like Taco Tuesday (99 cent tacos) and Chicken Chimichanga Thursdays (just $1.99).  The food is always hot and fresh, and they have good beans...which is always a benchmark for me!"}
{"text":"My husband & I met our friends Matt & Brooke here for lunch yesterday afternoon, so we could give them a present since I missed her baby shower the week before.   We met them there & the salsa/bean dip & chips were already on the table, they also ordered a side of guacamole. This was only my 2nd time here & the boys 1st so we had a hard time deciding. Brooke loves this place so she already knew what she wanted before we got there. We all liked how there were pics of each item on the menu. We finally decided; Nick ordered chicken tacos, Matt ordered a beef chimichanga, Brooke ordered beef & chicken enchiladas & I ordered the Arriba pollo con queso (a specialty item). We all enjoyed our meals, except for Matt. His chimichanga had ground beef in it. I told him he should have got shredded, it's so much better!  Service was a bit on the slow side, which seemed odd for the place being practically empty on a Sunday around 3pm. But our server was nice & he always made sure to refill our drinks. Our total (plus tip) came to an even $80, not too bad but a little steep for lunch.   Overall, we'd come back. Curious to try their beer that they brew right there in the restaurant & the desserts looked tasty as well."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars I could!  Listen to the ratings, we should have. My husband has been in the restaurant marketing business for over 20 years. So we said, how bad could it be?  We aren't from the area & wasn't sure what else was around.   To start the only way to fix this place is chuck the cooks, staff & managers!  The food was absolutely the worst tasting, sorry excuse for food that I have ever eaten in my life. We have eaten at hundreds of restaurants over the years, & I would rather eat at a White Castle then ever eat here again!  We were seated promptly and our waitress was kind. The chips and salsa were ok. It also came with refried beans that were, \"stupidly hot\", to quote my husband. The salsa was not as spicy but didn't have a lot of flavor. I don't mind spice as long as it's flavorful. This was not!  The menu has ratings of peppers, 0-3. I guess if you count Hot/Spicy as a flavor, this place might be for You.  The waitress informed is that she enjoys spicy food but 1 pepper is all she can handle & typically only orders 0 pepper meals. She only orders 1 meal & felt it is the best, I regret not picking it!  I ordered the sampler meal, my husband the shrimp fajitas. Let's start with his meal. The nice thing it had 12 shrimp, they were fairly small. The grilled onions and peppers were cut small, cooked to death, & then spread over the plate so it appeared larger. It came with a side of rice, 3 tortillas & a bowl of sour cream, guac, & tomato's. When scraping the shrimp & veggies into a pile there was enough to fill ONE tortilla shell including the guac and sour cream. Price=$16.99!    Now onto my disaster. 1 tamale, a rolled taco (cut in half), 2 mini tacos, some other rolled thing (cut in half), & a blue corn tortilla bowl filled with refried beans. The tamale had, literally, a teaspoon of meat down a crack in the middle. A teaspoon of meat was a theme on my plate. The corn part of the tamale was not moist & the cheese they melted on top had very little flavor!  The fried rolled taco was next. Minuscule amount of Meat=No flavor a little crispy but mostly soft and squishy!  Two mini tacos: Mostly lettuce, 2 pieces of diced tomato's & again the teaspoon of shredded meat substance. meat was dry & had a jerky-like texture. Finally I  came to the other rolled thing on my plate. It resembled the rolled taco but used flour tortillas instead of corn. So it had that puffy, crispy look. I saved it thinking, \"That looks good, I'm gonna wait til the end to eat it.\" YUCK! Ate the first one (reminder it is one whole one cut I half so you feel as if you have two). After the first bite I covered it in guac and a cream cheese mix that came with it....didn't help. It was slightly, & I mean SLIGHTLY crispy in the outside & soggy gross inside. Pulled the other one apart, wondering what was in it. After unrolling this piece of garbage i found a tiny, that is a generous measurement, amount of what looked to be chicken. I picked it up with my thumb & forefinger to show my husband; my fingers touched the portion was so small. They had wrapped the tortilla 4 or 5 times around making it appear larger, this only added to the slimy, smooshy texture on the inside. Needless to say, I didn't eat it! The refried beans in the  blue corn tortilla was actually decent & had a nice flavor. The rice on my hubby's plate was alright but was about the size of a small scoop of ice cream. Price=$13.99 NOT worth it!!    Service: the food, actually, came out rather quickly. We went without anything to drink for a good ten minutes as we watched the wait staff walk back & forth chatting. Our server appeared to be the only one working. I a asked for extra lemons & some ketchup before the food was served. She promptly forgot but remembered without me having to remind her later. (Ketchup? You ask. Hey the food was horrible, it needed help!). After that she actually did well with keeping our drinks filled & asking if we were alright.  For service I will give her a 2. All others stood around chitchatting when they should have been filling empty drinks. Trust me, the restaurant was not busy & there were plenty of people standing around doing nothing.   We paid $40 for two of us & have eaten $6 dollar meals that stomped this place into the ground!  We should have talked to a manager, but had a 3 hour drive.....we were just ready to leave!    We will NEVER EVER eat here again & you can guarantee we will tell everyone how absolutely, disgusting their food is!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time as we purchased a Groupon.  We ate here for lunch.  The menu is huge, and while great it was really had to decide what to have.  They serve chips, salsa, and refried beans as a starter.  The salsa tasted like Pace out of a jar and the refried beans tasted funny.  The entrees were subpar - we've had much better Mexican food other places.  We won't eat here again, even if we have another Groupon offered.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Only two stars cause kids eat free. Poor greasy food. Dirty and bad service. Save yourself and eat somewhere else. One star for free kids food which was very great and badly cooked and one star for the balloon animal. Don't use the bathroom. Don't order anything. Wash heavy with tequila."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The hottest Hatch chile I've had in this state.  Much hotter than Los Dos Molinos in my opinion..."}
{"text":"I recently visited this Arriba and let me say, I have never had such a horrible experience in my life. My girlfriend loves cheese, I would say she's somewhat of a connoisseur, so she ordered the queso fundido. The waitress was great, she lit the plate on fire creating a cool little show, but when we ate the cheese I nearly threw up!!! The cheese tasted rancid and sour. I thought maybe it was the everclear they added to create the wonderful light show, so we asked for a new plate without the light fire show, but when we tasted the new replacement queso fundido the same rancid taste filled my taste buds. I ordered the cheese covered chimichanga and although it tasted alright, the meat inside was not cooked completely. It's as if they threw it in the microwave for 3 minutes. The food literally took 5 min to come out from the moment we ordered it. I feel that had alot to do with the poor quality and taste of the food. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Simple Review....Gross....Not \"Mexican\" food at all and I will not ever go back... You couldn't pay me to eat that food again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have always been fans of Arriba but they drove us away as customers. We hadn't been back for a few months because of how bad our service had been but the food and drink was usually worth it. Let me tell you that is now sub-par as well, aside from the Margarita that was for 2 and fairly priced, the waitress didn't card us and proceeded to call us Kid's/Kiddo's the remainder of our visit. I work in the restaurant industry and would NEVER serve Kid's or Kiddo's a Margarita for two. Also no waters were given to us until requested. I ordered the Carne Asada and it came out looking good, until I started actually eating it, the carne was piled on top of a HUGE slab of red cabbage, gross. The waitress asked my boyfriend if he wanted Guacamole and Sour Cream making it sound like it was included in his meal so he said sure, the bill came and $1.99 for sour cream, and $2.50 for guacamole.... Holy hell they don't even give you more than 3 tablespoons of the stuff. Concern for the customers wallet is not there and we just had her pay for it with her tip, I don't think I've ever done that to anyone before. I do not recommend this place to ANYONE, unless you're just going for drinks and some chips and salsa other than that avoid this place entirely if you enjoy good service, friendly atmosphere, and good food."}
{"text":"Chinese fodd is my first choice. But recently I had tried Mexican food at Arriba Mexican Grill.  Food was great, the corn is exceptional. The atmosphere is unique and fun. The drinks are overpriced in my opinion and you can only have spiked juice."}
{"text":"First and foremost....great food and BETTER margaritas so much so we had them cater our wedding reception. Paco (manager at the 16th & Camelback location) and his team did a fantastic job and all of our guests raved about the food. We will be using them again for our next event.  Sherry and Corey"}
{"text":"We expected the same experience we have always had today. What a mistake. The 30 minute wait turned into an hour, the place was busy so we were patiently waiting. As we were waiting we were treated to one of the servers waking through the waiting area saying very clearly \" there's too many white people here\". His next trip through he clearly said \" you are all too happy and you are getting on my nerves.\". We prayed he would NOT be our server. We stood the whole time observing the dirty uncleared tables within a few yards of us. When we asked after an hour about our place we were informed we had already been seated....really? There were 6 of us within 6 feet of the front desk, our name was never called. The only bright spot today was the hostess who was mortified and truly apologetic. After we were seated we waited, and waited some more. The server was sweet and really unattentive. We stacked our empty dip and chip containers while countless employees walked past us, some of them chewing food and finally one offered to clear our empty dishes, we were still waiting to put in our food order. The food order was correct, but the warning about the \"very hot\" plates was completely unnecessary.  The apparent manager is completely out of her element. Not once did she do anything except rush past us, we did not observe her speak to a single customer. The table busser moves at a snails pave and it appeared that no one is trained in the art of customer service.  We have always enjoyed this place but we would need more than a sweet hostess to get us to go back."}
{"text":"The chicken picado is delicious.   If you are old enough,  ask to sit in the bar area.   Brianna the bartender is by far the best server there,  she will take care of you.  When you order your meal ask for the charro beans they are awesome instead of the normal refried beans you get with most Mexican type meals."}
{"text":"Overall, it's a pretty nice place. The food is nice. The atmosphere is nice and makes me smile. The staff are very nice... BUT, what really puts them over the top and makes me give them 5 stars is their lunch special. You get food for like two big meals for the price of half a meal during that time. Also, they're very generous with hot and mild salsa and bean dip with your chips while you wait for your food. You can even time it up to where you are there for the lunch special AND happy hour (coinciding between 3 and 4 I believe). I've gotten lunch, a margharita, and left generous tips for almost less than $10 all total and was more than satisfied. Always a good experience when I go there for the lunch special."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Affordable and delicious. The green hatch chilies are hot and flavorful. The service is always fast and accurate. I've been visiting this location for years and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was horrible!   We have been coming to the restaurant for 6 years. The last 4 times we have been at the restaurant have been so disappointing. I think I will find a better place!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed and embarrassed!  Brought out of town guest to have dinner. Our waitress was very unfriendly and service was bad!"}
{"text":"My mom and I have frequented this place for a few years now. Their lunch specials M-F are totally worth it. (Mainly Enchilada Monday and Chimichanga Thursday). If you're ordering for dinner, most of their items are a tad pricy in my opinion, but not to the ridiculous end. Their margaritas are HUGE and delicious (especially if you splurge for the Cabo wabo one) and their bean dip is to die for! I definitely recommend this place and if you're going to get something enchilada style, go with the green sauce!"}
{"text":"Yikes...I'm surprised this place is still in business. We went on a Friday night around 7. Maybe 1/4 of the place was full. The waitress took our drink order right away but then took about 15 minutes to come back for our order. We finally placed our orders and waited and waited and waited. Took nearly an hour to get our food!! No sorry, no I'll check on it for you, no manager giving a crap, no nothing!!  Food finally came and it was actually pretty good. But due to the service alone and lack of management not helping out we will never go back. On top of it all the horrible serving waitress had the nerve to add 18% gratuity on her crappy service!!  Their are way to many better restaurants in Scottsdale to ever have the need to go back to this mess."}
{"text":"Our first time to this restaurant and my wife ordered a mixed salad. The waiter told us there would be several different ingredients in the salad. When it arrived it was just lettuce. We had to ask for some tomatoes and carrots. Unless you are looking for a place to drink only (the drinks we saw coming to other tables were huge) the food portions were less than desirable."}
{"text":"I live in walking distance to Arriba's and was so excited to give it a shot. I mean who can really beat $.99 margaritas right? I went with a close friend. The food was okay, decent, not real mexican food but I wouldnt complain The margaritas were AWFUL. They tasted disgusting and I'm pretty sure there was no alcohol in them at all. They really need to step up the drink game, especially in downtown phoenix.. Just gross.."}
{"text":"As another reviewer wrote, have never had a bad experience at Arriba's.  My wife and I first visited the Glendale restaurant around 12 years ago and immediately proclaimed Arriba's to be our most preferred Mexican restaurant, to this day!! And, we are from California!?  Have yet to find a better Mexican restaurant, anywhere!  Love the Hatch chilies!!!  And the foods flavor is superb!!  Found out they do Hatch chili roasts in late summer (as well as is done in Cali) but will make it a point to visit again at that time!"}
{"text":"After 2 visits to this location I dont think I will be back, Very inconsistant food quality and service. Not helpful with problems. I have eaten at other locations with better service & food. Also a side note that all food served in Gooyear has an extra 2% tax on top of the 9.8% sales tax."}
{"text":"Decent Food, Average Service, cheesy decor but killer margaritas. Arribas Margaritas are like a half liter in the largest martini glasses in town. I know why people go there. Its not for the the average mexican fare its definately for the fact they can order one drink and sip it all night long.  I do like the fact that they serve a very good bean dip with their chips. Free anything is good in my opinion. I will add that they have the worst advertising and product photography and it probably scares more people away than gains new customers."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love to go to Arriba whenever we feel like we want to go out to eat and don't want to take a chance on the food being subpar.    This past weekend not only was the food delicious, but additionally the service we received exceeded outstanding.  My mother had bought us a 40$ gift card for a date night out, and upon arriving to the restaurant we asked the waitress to check the amount of money that was on the gift card. After checking she returned telling us that the card had never been loaded, and was thus empty. I called my mother to see if she still had her receipt, which she did. She proceeded to call the restaurant and talk to the new general manager, Dan, who was kind and generous to all of her inquiries. He recognized that a mistake had been made and comped our entire meal, as well as giving us the number of the card that was supposed to have to original 40$ on it.   The food was spectacular as always, and will Dan's intervention the meal was a complete success, I cannnot wait to return to this location as I'm sure we will have an amazing time."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican food place in phx, I always overeat and have plenty of leftovers the next day. I highly recommend the hatch chile cheese crisp for spicy addicts who like to cry while eating. Great priced margaritas always also. Nom nom nom.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this Arriba's location about a week ago.  We are regulars at this location because of my love of their shrimp and scallops enchiladas.  My boyfriend is not a huge fan but he humors me at times.    We get seated and he orders enchiladas with red chile.  Our food comes out and his enchiladas have green chile on them.  He looks at me to double check and make sure he had said red chile and I tell him that I heard him say red chile.  It's not a big deal and so we tell the waiter.  The waiter says he thought we had said green chile but is very nice and takes it back to the kitchen to have them change it.    As I'm starting on my meal, we hear arguing from the kitchen.  We hear someone yell in the kitchen, \"I wrote down green chile but that guy out there is saying he said red chile.\"  After hearing this, we don't really feel comfortable staying at the restaurant.  We call over the manager and explain what happened.  He was very nice and we offered to pay our bill for our drinks and my dish but the manager told us to not worry about it and that he hoped we would return.    We just didn't feel comfortable staying and eating after hearing the arguing from the kitchen concerning our food. It made us feel unwelcome and as if they thought we were at fault for what had happened.    I come here mainly for the shrimp and scallops enchiladas, which I absolutely love.  In the past few years, I have noticed the quality of the food decline.  The shrimp/scallop enchiladas used to come out piping hot with lots of cheese and covered in a rich cream sauce.  The last few times I have been to the restaurant, the tortilla has been dry, no sauce, and it looks like they just slapped two pieces of sliced cheese on top of the enchilada.  I have been very disappointed.    All that being said;  PROS: great chips and salsa               usually great servers                managers have been very pleasant and accomodating  CONS:  decline in food quality                hostesses are not very friendly                menus always feel very oily  I think that we will probably try a different Arriba's location in the future."}
{"text":"Asked if they had a sour cream sauce enchilada. Received enchiladas swimming in a cheesy sauce, swimming to the point I can't find the food.  I removed an entire salsa bowl of sauce, and the entire plate was still swimming in this not so good sauce.  The rice was covered in it as well as the beans and the salad.  When the server returned, I told him it was inedible.  He said:  Ok.  Would you like another margarita?  When the check came, I told the server again that the dinner was inedible.  He said;  Okay and walked away.  He removed my full plate of food from the table and took the check and payment away.  I left a tip for his service."}
{"text":"A group of us typically meet at the Arriba's in the San Tan area and have never been disappointed, however, it is quite the drive, as I live in Ahwatukee.  My boyfriend and I decided to visit the Arriba's on Chandler blvd. The hostess was less than welcoming but we did get to sit right away.  The server seemed to be displeased to be at work and was very short with us.  I unknowingly put my hand in a cooked onion/pepper that was left in the booth, so clearly it wasn't wiped down between guests.  Our server forgot our appetizer, but I mean, things happen and I would let that slide anyways, since the chips and salsa are always delicious anyways.  Our drinks and water came out right with the food.  I ordered vegetarian fajitas and got a skillet full of onions and I think 3 green peppers.  My boyfriend and I vowed to never go to that location again."}
{"text":"Very slow service. We didn't get menus for 20 minutes and no food for 40 minutes after sitting down. Once the food did come the server was obviously high on hard drugs. He was shaky, eyes glazed over, and acting very odd."}
{"text":"This was one of the few places we found open on Christmas day and we went for dinner. Even though the place was packed and there was a line out the door, we were seated in less than 10 minutes and the service was excellent.  Having lived in New Mexico for about 5 years, I've learned a lot about green chile. I've also learned that more often than not, when you visit a restaurant serving green chile outside of New Mexico, their idea of \"hot\" is what we would call less than mild in NM. So, I was pleasantly surprised at Arriba's when I ordered a two chile dish (1 chile being mild, 2 medium and 3 hot) and got what I'd hoped for. Personally, I can't handle anything beyond medium when it comes to green chile unless I'm so sick that my taste buds are numb (which is when hot green chile is ideal). However, i was there with two people who like their chile VERY hot. One of them ordered a 3 chile dish and the waitress looked at him suspiciously (he's a pastey white guy, not one you'd peg to be able to handle spicy food) and asked if he'd ever had green chile before. He informed the waitress he was from NM at which point the waitress smiled and understood. Less than 10 minutes later my friend's eyes were watering and he had a big grin on his face. It was good stuff.  Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed by my margarita. You would think that this giant concoction (they come in those really huge margarita glasses), the entirety of which I finished, would have at least caused me to slur a word or two by the end of the night...but, alas, I didn't even get a buzz."}
{"text":"Great Hatch spicy Beans, Queso Fundido is hot and spicy love the spinach enchiladas. It's pretty good food."}
{"text":"Came to Goodyear four years ago enjoyed their food.  What happened to their quality  And service? We ate their March 2016  Will never go back! Did not enjoy the food or service Ray"}
{"text":"Great Carne Asada.  Pretty rad that they have Hatch Green Chilis from New Mexico, and an entire portion of their menu dedicated to New Mexican food, as well as regular Mexican food.  Also, they brew their own beer, which makes any restaurant/bar more legit.  TVs with sports, booze, and good food.  Definitely cannot complain."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. I ordered something a little off the menu.  I had the chile relleno but had them add the carne adobada instead of the regular shredded beef. Turned out to be a great choice. I think this may be my go to place for day drinking. They have a full bar. My birthday is on Saturday so it might be a great place to start the day.   Go!"}
{"text":"We had margaritas and chips with guacamole prior to our meal.  They weren't very good.  If you're a Mexican place and can't get margaritas and guac right you've got a big problem.  Service was very slow and the meals were blah t best.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"service is good but the food is going down hill. If you like hot, get a side of hatch chilis"}
{"text":"I didn't give it a 5 because it's not a 5 star restaurant but it certainly is a 4.   I went with my family and we all were happy with our food, and that hasn't happened in quite awhile. One of us always gets \"the bad plate of food\". Not here. We got there at happy hour, 99 cent margaritas. Heck yeah. Hubby ordered Hatch Chile Cheese Crisp, that could have feed all of us, end of story. It was delicious, the green chili had such a great taste not bitter at all and just the right amount of heat.   Here is the dinner line up... Hatch Chile Relleno. Awesome taste, not very spicy though.    Bandera Enchiladas. OMG Fantastic. Enchilada with red, green and  spicy queso fundido. The chicken was seasoned well, I could have just eaten that but what fun would that be.    Flaming Arriba Fajitas. Delicious! It was nice to get fajitas and not have it mainly grilled onions. This had a good portion of steak and grilled onions and green bell peppers. The tortillas were nice and fluffy. Came with the fixing of  guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo. Their guac is...yummy!  All 3 dinners came with beans and rice which I could have made a meal of. The dinners were huge and could easily be shared.  Lastly service. our waitress was very nice. She was exactly how I like to be waited on, answered questions about the food, took our order, brought drinks, food, checked if everything was good, cleared plates BEFORE bringing the bill, didn't hover around which I find annoying. I wish I could remember her name because she really did a nice job.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place is the worst!  I have eaten at this Arriba on many occasions, raw shrimp tacos and hairy ceiling fans were the nail in the coughin!  I talked to Jerry who introduced himself as the new General Manager, his resolution was a free meal next time I came in.  NO THANK YOU!  This is probably the dirtiest restaurant I have ever eaten at, the dust lingering above the booths was appaling.  If the restaurant is bad, imagine the kitchen!  If I could give it 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Enjoying the Sonoran ambiance and the food is quite tasty! The holiday burrito is one of the items on the secret menu! Delicious! Beer and house margarita cold and refreshing."}
{"text":"Third time here and no real complaints. Food is good and the happy hour margaritas have always been on point. Service has been friendly and courteous. I met the GM (Rana) this evening and I can see why I have always been pleased. Rana assisted me with seating and without my knowing of her position I offered her a tip which she refused. She simply asked that I extend it to the server. Will be back. Thanks Rana!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I thought I'd give em another try. This visit really isn't different than my last one. I ordered a Green Chile cheeseburger. The waiter had to advise me it'll be hot. Lol ok whatever. So I finally get it. The presentation of the food looked half assed. Very sloppy. I take the top portion of bread off... There's hardly any green chile on it. I ask for a side of chile. It shows up. The green chile was hot. Which is good. It tasted straight out of the can tho. Gross. I'm sure they get Hatch food service cans or something. My girlfriends meal wasn't much better. She got The Green Chile Chicken Especial or something to that extent. The presentation of the food was horrid. It was a conglomeration of rice, beans, and cheese. With a little boat of chicken soupy something or other. She said that it was too salty.   The food isn't New Mexican. It's Tex Mex style food using Hatch Chile."}
{"text":"Have tried to give this place a chance 4 times. It was always bad. Bad service meaning that they had never once gotten my order right, including ordering expensive drinks. I liked the one over in Arrowhead but I am afraid to go there anymore because of how awful this location is. Bad food meaning that it wasn't fresh, I paid for a steak and it was dry, and tasted old. We've tried emailing the head office but they say it's just people who are paid to put negative reviews, disgruntled former employees, and that they are always \"packed\". Well maybe with people who are so old they can't taste anymore. It's just a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"The service was less than satisfactory.  We ordered a beef burrito but wanted a traditional one like the popular Carne Asada in California but the only offered beef.  We asked if they could add beans, rice and salsa.  The waiter looked at us strangely then said he would order it,  We received a bean and cheese burrito with beef that was truly barely visible.  We cut open the burrito to see if it was at the other end, but there was no beef.  We told the waiter and he took a fork and looked through the burrito.  he said he saw a couple of pieces.  A beef burrito has beef.  Furthermore, two of the utensils were dirty. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Coming from California, we tried to order a Carne Asada burrito but the waiter stated they only offered beef.  He was very annoyed with us when we asked for a beef burrito with rice, beans, salsa.  He offered an alternative dish which basically had everything we wanted, but on the side.  We asked him to put all the side items inside the burrito.  Again, he looked at us strangely then served us a \"beef\" burrito with rice, beans and literally a sprinkle of trace pieces of beef.  When we brought it to his attention he took a fork to the burrito and said he saw pieces of beef.  When you order a beef burrito shouldn't it have beef with a little of the extras.  Several of our utensils were also dirty and the waiter did not speak to us again for refills or any other follow-up.  The dinner and service was disappointing.  atmosphere festive but we do not recommend at al!"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa with bean dip complimentary is delicious. I just got the chicken tacos; the portion size was a good bang for your buck! I'll be back to eat here."}
{"text":"I like this place...I keep coming back to it.  There are many Mexican chains out there in the world, but this place does Mexican food right.  The dishes are a New Mexico kinda twist on things.  The hatch green chiles are very hot if you are not used to it.  Pay attention to the chile ratings on the menu.  The chips come with 3 different kinds of salsa.  For that I will probably say this is the best chip/salsa setup in the valley.  The service sometimes is lousy."}
{"text":"My family used to come here a lot when i was growing up, but we quit coming a few years ago. I recently come to visit my parents in Phoenix so we came back to try it out.  We were sure sorry we did. Hands down the most aweful margarita i have had in my life. The food and service were just as aweful.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place. There are a ton of awesome restaurants in Phoenix. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in to this restaurant an hour and a half before closing time on a Friday night.  It was dead inside and we stood around to be seated for 15 minutes and NO ONE came to help us.  We went down to ask a server if there was a hostess to seat us and he said someone would be there soon.  We waited around for another 5 minutes or so and no one came to help us.    Definitely won't be coming back here since no one seems to care to help customers."}
{"text":"Sub-par food at rediculous prices.  My husband and I love Mexican food. We have tried several places since moving here a year and a half ago, and this has been the worst. The meat in my beef tacos had a really strange texture to it, hard to describe. I wanted to add sour cream, bill came and we were charge $2 just for that. Considering the whole experience and how expensive everything was, I will never go back here and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Was charged way more($12.75 - 15.00) for what we were told to be happy hour drinks. The manager took 20% off our sales tickets to make efforts to compensate. Food was decent. But have decided not to eat there again. I do not condone that type of action from staff. This particular waiter especially was very deceitful."}
{"text":"The food was great! But it was really expensive for a Mexican food joint. I love the hatch chilles that they put in a lot of their meals."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment about 4 or 5 times now and I have never been disappointed. The service is always great and fast. The meals are always good and I don't always order my favorite I bounce around the menu to see how there other dishes taste as well, and haven't been disappointed yet. I like the themes for each day of the week for instance, my last visit was on a Tuesday and of course...Taco Tuesday. Tacos were a 1.00 and great so if your ever in Chandler and want some good Mexican food Arriba's is wuts sup."}
{"text":"Service was slow (at 3 in the afternoon).  Food arrived before our drinks.  Request for water went unanswered.  Food a bit on the bland side (strange for a restaurant proud of its hatch chilies).  This is a new establishment so not sure they have their start-up bugs worked out yet."}
{"text":"I don't really eat Mexican food that often.  I mean, I like it and all, but it's not my favorite.  So, to be fair, maybe this is the way that \"good\" Mexican food is supposed to taste, and my taste buds have been corrupted by the likes of Filiberto's.    Anyway, my daily errands found me out in the far West Valley and hungry.  While driving, we happened to hear an ad for Arriba's touting their $1.99 chimichangas, and (un)lucky for us, it happened to be a Thursday and there was an Arriba's nearby.  *sigh*  We were seated immediately, which was good, but the waitress was immediately annoyed with us when we only ordered water with lemon.  That's what I always order when I eat out, just to save empty calories.  My friend wanted coffee, but we didn't think the coffee in a virtually deserted Mexican restaurant would be any good.   When the waitress came back with our drinks, we asked her about the $1.99 chimichangas.  We wanted to know how big they were, because for the price, we figured they would be on the smaller side, so we needed to know if we should order one or two.  With an exasperated sigh she said \"it's, like, a regular chimi.\"    We told her that we had never been to this restaurant before, so we needed to know what that meant.  Again, she just said, \"it's the size of a regular chimi.\"    *bites tongue*  We asked her what was in it and she told us that they were filled with beef and topped with either red sauce (hot) or green sauce (not hot).  Even though I like a little spice to my food, I ordered the green sauce because I thought that even if it wasn't \"hot,\" it would still be flavorful.  Besides, as with Thai food, I like to start out by ordering mild versions of the dishes, that way I know how the restaurant calibrates their spiciness meter and I'm not left with a dish that I can't eat, or at least won't enjoy.  While we were waiting for our lunch, we were noshing on chips.  We had two options of dip: a medium salsa and a bean dip.  The medium salsa was all right.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, either.  It was just all right.  The bean dip was a little iffy.  The waitress told us that they make it fresh there at the restaurant, but the dip had an aftertaste to me, like, beans that had been fermenting in the pot too long and were on the verge of spoiling.  You know what I'm talking about?  Like, kinda sour-ish.  Ugh.  I'm making myself a little sick just thinking about it.  Anyway, my chimichanga with a side of rice arrived.  My first impression was, \"Okay, this chimichanga is larger than I expected,\" and, \"Why is the rice brown?\"  Let me tell you about this grossness that they actually have the cajones to market as a \"chimichanga.\"  First, it seemed like one huge tortilla that was wrapped around a little bit of... stuff... like, four times.  The outside was a light brown color, but it wasn't fried.  The other layers of the tortilla tasted like they were steamed, or something.  Ooh!  I know!  It was like when you nuke leftover Mexican food and the microwave leaves the tortillas kinda soppy and slimy - from the steam or whatever.  I can't be the only person who has experienced this, right?    Anyway, ick.  Now, onto the \"beef.\"  I have never seen anything like it!  The chimichanga did have something in it that could possibly pass for a meat-like substance, but it wasn't like any beef I had ever seen or tasted.  The outer edge of the meat was browned like you'd expect beef to be, but the interior portion was WHITE!  It wasn't pork and it had the texture of chicken.  *shudder*  Not that it matters at this point, but the green sauce had absolutely no taste.  I didn't know that \"mild\" = bland.  I'm sure this doesn't come as a surprise, but the rice wasn't good, either.  First, it was hard, and second, the only flavor it had was of black pepper.   The only thing edible was the tiny bit of shredded lettuce and the five pieces of diced tomato that they used to garnish the plate.  Maybe it's me; maybe my palate lacks sophistication.    I did, however, bring the food home to feed my dogs and they didn't eat it, either.  Seriously.  Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Walked through the door and approached the check-in counter to be seated by the most uninterested in their job hostess.  No expression, no welcome, nothing.  Busboy comes around and non-chalantly tossed small plates on table without any greeting as if he had no pride in his job. Our server though seems to be the redemption, but I'm not sure.  So far the chips n dips are yummy, and I can see the waterfall, too bad its hotter than oven outside. Food was good, but missed a lot of the real flavor in homestyle dishes. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Great festive atmosphere, love Mexican food and this one is a keeper! Be sure to get there at happy hour cause appetizers are half off as well as $1.00 margarita's never had a bad experience and been there quit often  two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Went with my family.  At first we were not impressed and slightly nervous about eating here. While walking to the bathrooms upon first getting here I slipped on a wet spot on the floor.  I quickly notified a waitress and they cleaned it up.  Then entering the bathroom discovered floors covered in over spilling trash.  Again I notified management and they thank us and quickly took care of the problem.  We asked for a table but were walked to a booth.  We ordered raspberry tea and asked what other drinks they had.  Our server stated to us they were out of the raspberry tea and offered strawberry. Declining that flavor I went with just water.  I order the White Sand Chimi, My son ordered the Steak Tampico.  Attempted to get Menudo, but strangely enough for a mexican rest. they do not have any. The salsa and bean dip was great.  the salsa had a bite to it but the flavor was good.  getting our order served took a good 20-30 minutes.  The waitress was great and took good care of our needs as we waited.Once we got our meal, the food itself was delicious!  I thought I would burst from the large amount I consumed, but I couldn't help myself.  My tongue burning from the spiciness but my mouth kept saying \"more, more\".  Upon walking out I noticed yet another large wet spot on the floor.  Usually I wouldn't mention it but as I discovered when that floor was wet it was very slick. I give them 4 stars because the product the have is wonderful they just need to work on some of the esthetics.  Maybe it truly does represent a little hole in the wall rest. in Mexico.  If you like a kick to your food and really great tastes i truly suggest trying Arriba's."}
{"text":"I don't give five stars often, but here's my rationale. Their margaritas rock! It's the only place that you get your money's worth when you order a margarita. They are huge! They have a good variety of cool flavors to try too. Love it. But that's not it. They have the best green chili around, and it is HOT! I love hot spicy food, and this does not disappoint. Lastly, the chips and salsa service is good. I love the bean dip and the two types of salsa provided. i could just sit there and eat that alone.   Service is usually good. I normally just cruise in and sit at the bar. Can't wrong with service with the bartender standing in front of you the whole time. :)"}
{"text":"They have a daily special. We came on a Thursday and the special was a Chimichunga for 2.95. When the waitress asked if we wanted rice and beans and o yes how about guacamoli? Well the 2.95 special turned out to be 42.00 with tipfor 4 people. Granted we were remiss in not asking if the extras were included but in a mexican restaurant beans and rice always seemed to be included. Food was good but if you are on a tight budget beware of the daily specials."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant yesterday with my wife, sister and her husband.  The place was very busy at 3pm but I dont have a clue as to why.  We were seated underneath a ceiling fan and it felt like a wind tunnel.  After four requests, they finally shut it off.  When we were seated there was only one table around us occupied.  We waited almost 30 minutes for the food while all the tables around us were filled and served their meals.  The waiter said the kitchen was chaos whatever that means.   As far as the food, it was average at best.  The sauces were very salty and the chicken had been cooked the day before and warmed again.  The beans were like paste.  When ordering, we were asked if we wanted sour cream and Guac..  We said yes not knowing this would add an additional $5 to the tab.  Since when does a dollop of sour cream deserve a $1.50 charge.  And $2.50 for a small dollop of Guac..   Finally my wife had one of their famous .99 margaritas and if there is a nastier tequilla, I havent had it.   All in all a $30 waste and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Thought I would give it a shot because it's close....*sigh* Some of the blandest food I've ever had. The chips were very thick and powdery. The refried beans had no flavor whatsoever. The portions were huge but I didn't even want to take the leftovers because it tasted that bad. Such a waste of money. $22 for 2 appetizers. We had the nachos and he mini chimis. The chimis were decent but soggy. And the nachos had no flavor. I wouldn't come back for free :/ Sorry."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Came in and a waiter was sleeping on the bench in the lobby area. Turns out that was our waiter. He was grouchy and extremely rude. I got fajitas and requested no onions (I have an onion allergy) and he didn't seem to pay attention to that detail. Lo and behold our food comes out and there are onions. He took it back to have it remade and it took about an hour for me to get my food and by then everyone else was pretty much done eating. I will not come back. I can not believe how horrible of an experience it was."}
{"text":"Great green chili, help is usually good. always been pleased"}
{"text":"I have been to different Arriba locations and the food has always been consistent and I have always had very good service here.  I LOVE the White Sands Chimichanga, all rice,  no beans!  I have never been to a restaurant that provides beans like the ones you can get at home (you spoiled me mom!).    The Chicken Chimayo is pretty good too.   The chips were good.  I prefer the smoother chili/salsa because it is spicier than the slightly chuncky salsa they serve.  I don't really care for the bean dip but the rest of my family enjoys it.  My only complaint is that I have ordered a side of the sauce that they put over the chimichanga to put on my rice (like a cup for ketchup when you order french fries) and they charged me about $3 for it.  It was a pretty small serving for that price.  I usually try to avoid \"chain\" mexican restaurant, but Arriba is really good."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Mexican restaurants around. Got the chicken chimi for lunch. Was very disappointed & couldn't eat it. Waste of my time and money.  I will never return to this establishment. The only good thing was the outdoor waterfall."}
{"text":"Could have been the worst Mexican food I have had in a while.  You know how they always say \"the plate is hot\" at Mexican restaurants?  Well not this time.  The food wasn't hot either.  I would avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Though the service was pretty good, the food was just alright. The place is pretty dark inside and our table didn't have a light over or near it so we were unable to really see what we were eating. Nothing stood out as being particularly delicious - though I will say the Pozole was pretty good. They're \"hatch\" style is not as hot as I expected (unless of course you eat the chilis themselves!).  Overall just a-ok..."}
{"text":"Excellent New Mexico style food, great hatch green chile."}
{"text":"The food is all pretty greasy and a little overpriced. The Mexican pizza was pretty good if you're up for a heavy, grease-laden meal."}
{"text":"Wow all I can say is disappointing! Alan the bartender was the worst bartender I have EVER had!! I now know why there was only two people in the bar for happy hour.  Also the food was just bad Taco Bell would have been better, my five dollar burrito was bland with about two tablespoons of beans all tortilla, old lettuce and what looked to be shriveled up tomatoes, I was to scared to try those though. Chips were not even cooked properly and tasted rancid. The only thing that was ok was the salsa.  I did ask for more of that but never got it, also never got a check up by Alan. Please if you have a couple extra bucks do yourself a huge favor and DON'T! Go to this place!! Thanks Yelp rocks!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was 8 years old so 12 years now and I have never been disappointed! The chips aren't too salty or flavorless-they are always refilled and the plus is that they are free! My drinks arrive promptly and the servers always have my food come out exactly how I ask for it. The ambience is great because it feels like you're in a real authentic Mexican restuarant and the people are always kind and polite. I will never stop coming here! Keep up the great service guys"}
{"text":"I have visited a dozen times, food is can be very good but service is usually bad.  Last visit the waiter was beyond rude, we were kind of shocked at they rude way he dropped plates of food down.  We were very polite so I have no idea why he had such bad attitude. I will not visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, \"Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?\" I went there, and had an awesome time! Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didn't blame anyone, and didn't use server jargon. I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it.   Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name. It burned, but I loved it. I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy. (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course. I'm not a huge margarita person, but it was really good. She ordered the cheese enchiladas. (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min-   Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's. I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat!  After dinner, I ordered another margarita...  This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation. Why do I do this? Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. 'Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I don't even know the name. It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, that's all I'm going to say. Thanks!  That's why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion. I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then don't eat food that is 99% based on heat.  I will surely be going back, and I won't have a bad time."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Unimpressed with the salsa (I've had jarred that is better). The four people in our party tried the Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas, the Chicken and Beef Enchiladas, the Burrito special, and the Tacos El Carbon. Nothing terrible, but nothing to write home about either. Tasted bland and pre-packaged."}
{"text":"I love that they accommodate my food allergy!!! They will happily make flour tortilla chips! And the mini chimis are so good. I'm always very happy after eating there and my kiddos love it too!"}
{"text":"While some of my friends don't particularly like the food here, I think it's great.  Nice and spicy.  Great atmosphere and prices are hard to beat as well.  Just stay away from their $1 margaritas and you'll be good."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went there last night for the first time and it was really good, but a little too spicy.  I like spice, but the kind that lingers in your mouth for hours.  For dessert I got the stuffed sopapilla and it is to die for!  The atmosphere was very enjoyable too!"}
{"text":"Sat for 15minutes no one came to serve us, they checked on the booth in front of us, but ignored us completely. Going to Cracker Barrel down the road."}
{"text":"Recently started to come to this place with a few girlfriends of mine & we love it! We knew we would love it once we took one taste of the bean dip! Happy Hour keeps us coming back for more! You can't beat The beef mini chimis. They are to die for! Along with the 1.99 House Margarita was the PERFECT match! For it being their well tequila, it was awesome! (Thank you to the bartender Logan!)  Not to mention their service, we are pleased every time!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service.  Food is too spicy for me but that's my problem."}
{"text":"Went there on 11/28/13 for dinner, and will never go back. The chips were stale, and the food was way over priced for what you get.  You would expect for $15 meals it would be good, but the flavor was not great and the food tasted old.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We went here for a family dinner.  Our family is loud and boisterous but not obnoxious.  We asked to be seated in the bar since some of us wanted to watch the game.  No problems so far.  Our waiter was really nice at first, but seemed flustered and as if he wasn't getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables.  I waited tables for 12 years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up, a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork.  Of the two hostesses, ONE of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water, tea and soda for us, but alas they did nothing.  We waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar, so he poured himself a glass, which he was scolded for!  I could not believe it, I was shocked.  A guest should NEVER be treated this way.  If anything, someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal.   The chips were good, and they kept them coming, so props to them for that.  They are served with bean dip and salsa.  I liked the salsa a lot, not spicy enough for me, but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff, including cilantro which I find many \"salsas\" don't even contain!  To me, it is not salsa without cilantro.  The teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking.  They should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size.  It's only about 2 Tablespoons, and that aint much salsa (beware, some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers - three or four bites and it's gone)!  Anyhow, we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took SO long to come out.  Our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually coming.....someday.  Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered.  Sadly, two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas (which came out of the kitchen very cool, not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat) had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas, so they couldn't even eat what was at the table, which was getting cold.  After the two missing meals came out, one was the wrong meat, red meat instead of chicken.  More waiting...the table eats, minus one.  When everyone is nearly finished, the right chicken taco dish comes out.  It was delicious, but overpriced.  The chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way I like them, with a little bit of onions, more cilantro, lettuce, lime and pico de gallo.  They also came with cheese, but I don't like cheese on tacos.  They came on tiny little corn tortillas, which themselves were good, but way too small to make decent tacos that didn't fall apart.  Plus, I ran out of  the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone.  Our waiter was really nice except for the scolding (I'm still floored by that), so I can't decide if he sucked or the place sucks, or maybe they both do...We definately won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to start a Sunday, jumbo marigatas, tacos and wonderful serivce from Alexandra and Jason! Our Sunday tradition."}
{"text":"This may be my worst dining experience ever.  The scenery was beautiful, we can't complain about that. The menu was decent, there was a good number of selections to choose from. However the prices were definitely high, we're just talking tacos & burritos here...  I ordered a taco salad with steak. It was $11.99, for lunch...which I thought was crazy.  When I got the salad, it was the cheap iceberg lettuce, with a couple tomatoes & a few onions. The steak was DISCUSTING. I wouldn't feed a dog that steak meat. I asked the waiter for some salad dressing, he gave me this funny look and said \"most people just use salsa, but I guess I can get you some ranch or something\". Great service, huh? I asked the waiter about the margarittas, and he willingfully told me that the 3 cheapest ones are no good and are too watered down. Nice...so I then asked about the Patron Margaritta (my fav tequilla). The Patron rita was $16!!!   The waiter was extremely unprofessional, and even gave us this pitch about how he's only working there until he finds a new \"gig\". The prices were ridiculous! I would NEVER go there again and hope to share my story with many people before they waste their money!!"}
{"text":"After reading through these reviews, I have to say I am a little surprised at all the bashing this place has been getting. Arriba's happens to be one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  I've been here twice, on a Monday evening and on a Friday night for specials occasions and each time the service has been fast, friendly, and wonderful. The chips were good, the salsa was fresh and spicy (just how like it), and our waiter was patient with how indecisive my dear family can be at ordering.  When we finally got our food, everyone enjoyed it a lot. It didn't take a million years to get to our table either. I ordered the Chile Poblano the first time and thought it had really nice flavor (the rest of my family thought so too considering they couldn't stop trying to eat it haha.) The second time I decided to order something spicier so I got the Hatch Chicken Especial. That was probably one of the more spicy dishes I've eaten in my life, but it still kept nice flavor. My chicken was thoroughly cooked, seasoned well, rice and beans were delicious, I loved it.   I'm sad that some people have had such poor experiences here, I'm hoping it was just a bad server or an off day for them, because I haven't been disappointed yet. I should warn those that aren't fans of spicy (like my dad) to stay well below the 2 chile sign on the menu. But if you're more like me and love spice, try the 3 chiles.   I hope this review helps!"}
{"text":"Will not be returning. I have ordered take out here a handful of times and have enjoyed the food. My most recent (and final) experience here was quite disappointing.  I ordered a meal over the phone and made a dietary restriction very clear to the person taking my order. I requested the queso sauce on my entree, just as I did every other time I ordered here. I requested the queso sauce because they have listed the ingredients to me in the past, and I knew it wouldn't aggravate my stomach. I was told that it would be an extra charge (previously this was never brought to my attention) and that the red sauce included with the entree would adhere to my initial dietary request. Ok, fine-red sauce it is.   Next, I brought the food home and began to dig in. Immediately, I started to feel sick to my stomach. I called the restaurant to confirm that the red sauce did not contain the ingredient that I am sensitive to- and sure enough, they said that it DID.   I asked to speak to a manager and requested a full refund and they reluctantly agreed. More than two months have gone by and I was never refunded for this meal.   It's unfortunate to feel like an inconvenience when you express a dietary restriction. If a request cannot be accommodated, then the establishment should be clear about that. I was given misleading information regarding my meal, which ended up making me ill. I'm unimpressed with how this entire situation was handled."}
{"text":"I got sick eating this food.. DONT EAT HERE.. my wifes co workers had the same experience"}
{"text":"The service was terrible! Waitress took 15 minutes to get our order. Took our order and another tables order at the same time. Brought the other tables order to them and they finished eating their food and left before our order was brought out to us. We waited 40 minutes to get our food. Not sure what the problem was because they did not feel it was necessary to apologize for the wait."}
{"text":"Nice people not so great food! Cold food served, freezer burnt ice cream, just not that great"}
{"text":"I usually \"dine in\" at Arriba's and am always 100% satisfied but last night I decided to order take out and boy! was I highly disappointed. (Ordered: 4 shredded beef tacos with chips)  I got home, opened my container of food, bit into my shredded beef taco, and what I tasted was \"old food or overcooked\" (hard, dried out beef). I should have known something was wrong because the take out container is usually so hot on the bottom, I can't hold it. Not this night! The chips were cold too. I immediately drove back to the restaurant and asked to see a manager. The so called \"manager\" walked to the front and just stared at me like \"what do you want\". I told her how disappointing I was with my order and that my food was old. She opened the container and said \"well i tasted all the food this morning and everything was fresh\" (so I'm a liar now)?.   She then opens up the taco and sees the meat and says nothing. This woman didn't even attempt to make a move towards the kitchen to make me fresh tacos. I had to ask her to re-make the food. She takes the container and heads towards the kitchen. She comes back with the SAME containers only this time with new tacos. She hands them to me and stares. I said \"let me check them and can I also get fresh chips?\". She leaves again, comes back and hands them to me like \"leave already\".  The entire time this \"Manager\" doesn't apologize for the inconvenience, even attempt to try to make the situation better by asking \"what can I do to make this better\". She was young and was not experienced whatsoever.   ***I recommend that if you go to Arriba's, BE SURE TO DINE IN!!!!!! or if you order take out CHECK THE FOOD AT THE COUNTER."}
{"text":"Gross. This place is a disgrace to mexican food . I swear everything in our plate came out of a can. Not fresh and not by anyway good. I hate leaving a place hungry but you couldn't force half that stuff town my throat."}
{"text":"So left this place and I'm never ever going back to that location ever again. The server was horrible and didn't even bother apologizing after bringing me the wrong food order. When he brought the right order he just placed the food on the table and walked away giving me attitude. The food looked so horrible even looking at it. I couldn't even take a bite coz after looking at the food I just lost my appetite. This place used to be my favorite place but after today, no more. Very poor poor customer service."}
{"text":"1st off, the AC apparently does not work causing everyone there including the waitress to sweat profusely.   Then our service just topped off the bad experience.  Our waitress showed up within minutes of being seated and we ordered just waters to drink...sounded good since it was so hot in there.  Well, just over 10 minutes later a busboy notices we are still waiting for our waters so asks what we ordered and immediately gets them for us.  5 minutes later our waitress finally comes back and takes our order.  Another server then brings us our food.  It's not busy at all in the restaurant so not sure what our waitress is doing but it's definitely not helping us.  The 3rd and final time we saw her, was to bring us our bill.  The food was good but not good enough to go back get that service again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5 times or so, the last few times because friends picked it and I went along. The last visit was because we decided to give it a try. The food is okay, and the Margaritas are surprisingly inconsistent - sometimes great, sometimes tasting of strong sours mix.  I really wish hygiene were more of a priority. On my last visit, we were greeted by a courteous young lady who sat us down at a booth. That booth, however, had sticky seats and table. And it wasn't the type of stickiness that comes from forgetting to clean a table... nay, it was that stickiness of a table, seat and menus diligently wiped down with a dubious rag, thus homogenizing the film of subtle but persistent stick factor over all these things. Perhaps I was being too squeamish. I wanted to like this place, to reassure myself that it was still okay to eat here: I put the menu down and picked up the plates in the table setting to inspect them... and there was stickiness on those too, along with dried food stuck on one of them. At that point, my wife and I decided to not eat here, and started heading out. The hostess asked us why we wouldn't stay and I discreetly told her and showed her. She agreed that it was terrible and sought to make things better, even offered to give us a soft drink on the house to go, but we declined and thanked her.  Since I am the king of not letting go, I will probably give Arriba's another try in the future. I urge you to give them another chance as well, although it's hard to justify with so many interesting places to eat in the area.  And sadly, I must say that the same pervasive stickiness was found in all my visits, but I kept overlooking it, and I kept coming back to meet up with friends. Well, now I suggest an alternate spot.  This is a great location and a substantial investment. I really hope management turns this around... it could really be great, but it is such a missed opportunity."}
{"text":"We had seen the commercials for this place often, so we thought we would try it for lunch.  We discovered this was not a good idea.  First we waited in the front to be seated while no one even noticed us for about 5 minutes, and we were the only ones there. Then the plates on the table had greasy marks all over them, and my napkin was wet before I even sat down.  The salsa tasted like it was from a jar and the bean dip was fairly flavorless.  The chips were fine.  I ordered two ground beef tacos with rice and beans.  I thought how wrong could I go with this?  It was the worst taco I have ever had in my life.  It was greasy and gristly.  The beef had a horrible flavor.  The side of beans tasted like a glob of refried beans from a can, and ironically were the only thing I could choke down.  I was also surprised at the higher prices than I had anticipated.  I feel completely ripped off by this experience and will never, ever go to Arriba anywhere again.  Try Serranos for a cheaper much tastier and cleaner experience!"}
{"text":"Our service was terrible. Our server forgot about us, so we sat there for 20-25 mins before we could order. Then our order was wrong, the server fixed it. I was happy until the manager came over to ask how things were. He was defensive and extremely rude! Our order was wrong and they need to fix there menu of they're going to add an ingredient. I'll never eat at Thor location again!"}
{"text":"Moday lunch special; cheese enchiladas with delicious beans & rice. Prices were wonderful with great service. Manager told us about the .99 Margarita special Monday thru Friday from 3 to 7pm."}
{"text":"The service was good. The food was gross and overpriced and made me sad to have to part with my money after eating the\"food barf.\" it was $50 including 2 beers for two people."}
{"text":"We will not return. I'm a big fan of fish tacos but not Arriba's. Sigh... tiny piece of fish inside of what tasted like store bought corn tortillas (you know, the wal-mart ones that fall apart when you take them out of the packaging?) They were not even warmed up or heated in oil to soften them. Tons of cabbage in them and the sauce had way too much jalapeno...probably to try and overpower the lack of flavor in the tiny piece of fish. Hubby's plate was blah too. He had a tummy ache by the time we got home. Such a bummer ... what's with restaurants these days? Seriously, how hard is it to screw up a fish taco? Obviously very easy for this place. :/  Then we watched the people in the next booth share one of those gigantic margaritas for 2 while sitting with their 3 yr old. Who was driving home? The tot?? Sheesh."}
{"text":"Salsa and pollo con queso are my favs! Always Great food and friendly service! Come for their lunch deals before 1130am on the weekdays!"}
{"text":"They have a good happy hour and they are also a micro brewery. Their brewery provide light, dark, and Amber. You wouldn't expect it from a Mexican restaurant. The service her is friendly and fast, but can like any place get a little slow when it's busy. The food is is tasty, I would recommend the white queso sauce. The white sands or the rio enchiladas. They let you know how hot it is by the peppers on the menu. If you have a large family or group this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Not a great start - 7pm and took 12 minutes for a hostess to appear.   Food took over an hour to arrive, and and took almost 45 minutes for them to explain that the kitchen was behind.   Drinks were very slow, so, they are still. OT doing to great.  I've been here before, and never had it that bad.  Patio doors were opened up, and the restaurant was pretty warm and stuffy inside.  Food was fresh and warm, but, couple of issues and mistakes on the order itself."}
{"text":"My husband met some clients there so we asked him to bring home chicken and steak fajitas.  He ordered one of each but they gave him one tray with a combo but charged him $26.00.  They were disgustingly greasy, had no flavor and we threw most of it away.  I would not eat there on a bet.  Now if you want great fajitas go in town to La Playa Hermosa, now that's quality food.  Such a waste of $26.00"}
{"text":"I've been going to Arriba for years and never really had a bad experience.  It's my kid's favorite restaurant.  I went in on July 4th and half way through my meal I noticed a cockroach on my plate.  Laying right under my carnitas.  I was pretty close to tears in the restaurant.  I will never return to this location again. I may go to the Camelback location again after I get over the trauma.  But this was one of the worst experiences of my life."}
{"text":"We went for dinner. All was well until I  scooped out some salsa and on the chip was a long black hair!!! The manager came by to find out how the meal was, my husband asked for a soda refill, I told her all was ok until I found a hair in the Salsa, she kept walking. Sge came back, dropped off the soda & walked away.  I showed the hair to the waiter, he took the napkin with the hair, never brought any new salsa nor asked if we wanted more..  Before we left I asked for the Manager, asked me why I didn't tell her earlier & I explained I did & she ignored me. Claims she didn't hear me.  End of story they don't care. Look out when eating the salsa... still nauseous!!! NEVER GOING BACK."}
{"text":"We went to Arriba in Goodyear last night with a friend. It seems this location had a lot of bad reviews. Well i will tell you,we sat at the bar and our bartender Ruth was amazing. She let us try a couple of samples of their burritos. She was so friendly and was right there if we needed anything. Oh by the way The Holiday Burrito is to die for. I don't know where these reviews are coming from but do not buy it!"}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly service. Cant wait to go back! There is a place in PHX that has spicy Mexican food!! WOOHOO!!!   The waiter was new and you could tell...actually, there was a few new waiters. I read that they do have a revolving door here. Honestly, who cares as long as I get good service and good food at a great price!   Chips and 2 types of salsa when I sat down. The bean and cheese dip is YUMMY! my chimicanga was YUMMY! My drinks were always filled and the waiter didnt overly bug us!  This may just be my favorite Mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"P.P.S. The 1.99/lb HatchChile Special has ended, Like GirlScoutCookies, VidaliaOnions, et cetera,  et cetera. Never long enough......"}
{"text":"Can you say horrible?  Don't waste your time!  12:45 pm later side of lunch rush. Maybe 10 cars in parking lot and 25 people max in the restaurant. I stood in the lobby for 10 minutes before the hostess even showed up. More and more groups showed up behind me too. A waiter walked by 4-5 times and looked at us and never made the effort to recognize the crowd assembled at the entrance. The hostess finally showed up and was more interested in accommodating a to go order than the crowd looking to be seated.  So I left and went to Oreganos nearby. This may be my last attempt to give this place $$."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better then this place awesome food awesome drinks awesome environment come during happy hour and try the margarita with the coronita"}
{"text":"I went there with my wife, her bean burro was salt with beans, so was my side of beans, also when I cut into my burrito it was like someone turned on a faucet, water came pouring out!!! Extremely disappointed... although the service was really good... will I go there again??? I have to say no thanx..."}
{"text":"Was absolutely horrible. We called in the afternoon for reservations, we got there at our time, table hadn't been set up. Had to wait about 15 minutes before we were finally seated. Took another 10 minutes before our server bothered to come over and greet us. About 20 minutes later she finally took our food orders. And this was a quiet night, weren't many other customers, but they were slow as molasses syrup in the winter.  The after I got home was checking my credit card account and found out they double charged me. Sorry Arriba, you won't be getting my business again. And your margaritas are very subpar"}
{"text":"We usually go here because of the chili they provide with the chips and the enchiladas. However, the SOPAPILLAS we ordered July 21st (6 altogether) came back FLAT AND HARD..  They are supposed to be light, fluffy and soft.  We could not chew them so we asked for replacements.  Waiter said he would fix one order but came back with the same sopapillas.  This time they were FLATTER AND COVERED WITH GREASE!  Seems like the cook took our sopapillas and used a pancake turner to re-heat them in grease. Maybe he was getting back at us   for us not liking them the first time.  We didn't even try to bite these \"replacements\".  Left them on the table, paid full fare, and left very puzzled."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places.  Always good food and a little bit of a different selection than some Mexican places.    Their chips and salsa are very good and we have always had very good service here.  They stay open on some unusual holidays so we have eaten here a couple of times when no other place was open."}
{"text":"I have given this place a few tries and on my third was the last straw. I don't want to be too harsh...... but this food is just too hard too stomach, no flavor and not fresh, will no eat there again"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit to Arriba's for my wife and I and since they only serve breakfast on the weekends we had their Huevos Rancheros Stacker. It is the closest thing to Little Anita's in New Mexico and the only place to get good Hatch Chile cooking. I applaud your service we never had to ask for anything. Our server Suhail was outstanding and always came by to check on us. We will be regulars for breakfast from here on out"}
{"text":"I love the food here it is one of my favorite places. Problem is the service is horrible. I have been their over a dozen times and have only had great service once. I have walked in their multiple times were their are dirty glasses all over the bar because the bar got slammed with drinks for the restaurant and no one helped him clean. No presence of team work. No wifi available so doing work while enjoying a margarita is not possible. I would go their more often however it is hard to get people to agree to go with me due to their past experiences."}
{"text":"My family used to LOVE Arriba's in Gilbert. We've been going there for 99 cent tacos for nearly 3 years. We haven't been there since August due to scheduling changes, until today when we all had the day off. The service was the same it's always been when we first walked in and sat down...then we went to order and they didn't have the 99 cent taco special anymore. If that was my only complaint it would be okay to return. However, after ordering the 2 taco, rice, and beans special we received our food and the ground beef was RED. I mean raw as raw could be. It wasn't just on one plate, but we had ordered 4 of these specials and all 8 tacos were raw meat.   After our waitress took the plates back and promised to bring back different ones. The manager came over to explain their process for cooking meat. Apparently it's \"boiled\" for 5 hours to retain the seasonings they use,  which causes it to stay pink! In my 3 years of going here I have NEVER had meat that looked like this. I have had semi-pink meat and would occasionally send it back, if I was feeding it to my 1 1/2 year old niece. Today the meat clearly looked raw. The manager then continued to tell us that they would cook it on the flattop for us to make it brown, but it would lose the seasonings they use for their meat. She was incredibly rude and did not even offer her apologies. P.S. the people behind us complained about the same issue, paid for their drinks and left - without getting tacos that were cooked more.   Needless to say, we decided at that moment we would NEVER be going back! And thanks to this experience, we will never have to love for taco tuesday at Arriba's again!!"}
{"text":"I decided to try the kids eat free on Sundays with my two children. I only expected to get one kids meal free, but when my daughter (age 6) didn't like her meal (mac n cheese) and sent it back, I did not expect that to count as the free kids meal. Shockingly, the waitress told me she gave me my daughter's meal for free and when I asked about the kids eat free, she said the free meal was my daughters - the one that was sent back uneaten!!!   Horrible customer service. Horrible food."}
{"text":"this place is not very impressive. not terrible, just wouldn't recommend it. it seems to market to those recently turned 21 types who want a sugary birdbath margarita and haven't figured out yet that sweet and sour is gross. there are better places to spend your time and money."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was the bomb.  AWSOME!!!!!! I have found me a new place to eat Mexican styled grub, just like back home. They serve refried beans along with salsa and chips it's great."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was AWSOME!!!! Loved the bean dip they serve you with the chips and salsa. I'll be back, best Mexican grub that I've eaten since I moved here in 2014.!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love arribas!  I love their margaritas and the hatch chiles!  I love their breakfast there.  I hate this particular location.  Everytime I go in there I get the worst service.  I had ordered a margarita and the guy poured it from a pitcher, which was fine.  I told him Id pay extra to have him free hand pour me one, and he said he didn't know how :? aren't u a bartender at a mexican restaurant?? well good thing I know how to make my own margaritas, so i told him how to make it.  Then we ordered some queso as an appetizer but that never came.  The hand made margarita was really bad so i ended up drinking water.  We waited for like 45 minutes for our food, and this whole time, the server never came back to the table.  so i have two nasty margaritas in front of me and no water.  We got our food and it was cold.  I was done.  Again, I love Arribas, but this one is Shits-ville!"}
{"text":"I'm going right on the average here, and I think that's OK.  Over the past few months, me and my family have been coming here every once in a while for happy meal- cheap margaritas for the over-21 (not me) and half-off apps (what we normally get). Today, I went with my mother, sister, aunt, two cousins, grandma, and four friends. Despite only having six of the eleven to start off with, we went to the table pretty quickly. The server was friendly, and checked up every couple minutes (probably to just get some orders in) while we were waiting for the other guests. She was quick with the waters, and after the others came in, was fairly consistent with her service. The only complaint I had was she didn't ask about refilling my soda when it was getting close to empty.  Like we normally do, we tried to order completely off the appetizer section, since it was half off. Me, my mom, and my grandma split the taquitos, chicken mini chimis, and hatch chili quesadilla. The taquitos and chimis were slightly underseasoned, but were quite tasty in the dipping sauce the taquitos came with. The hatch chili quesadilla was really good! It was spicy, just how I like it; however, you could tell it had been microwaved, which slightly disappointed me.  The food was probably three out of five, and the service probably four, which is why I chose this rating."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could!  My husband and I ate here last night.  They have a sign that they have the best margaritas!  How about the worst we have ever had??  So, now to the food.  Our waitress brought us chips, salsa and bean dip.  The chips were so stale, we could bend them in half and they wouldn't snap!  The salsa tasted like someone dumped a ton of salt in it.  The bean dip was the only thing that was eatable.  I ordered chicken enchiladas with black beans.  My husband ordered the carnitas with black beans.  After what seemed like forever, we were brought two plates of food, and you guessed it...with refried beans practically spilling off the plate.  The waitress offered to take the food back and or get black beans, but we just kept the plates.  No room on these tables for any more plates (and no leg room under the tables either!).  My husband's carnitas had large slices of red cabbage and red onion in it.  What?  Cabbage in carnitas?  Needless to say, it was bland and simply awful.  The only way he could eat it was with some of the over salted salsa.  My enchiladas were the worst I have ever had!  Bland, no flavor.  I had to add some of the bean dip just to eat about half of one of them.  Then we asked for a to go container for the rest of my food and the bill.  Fifteen minutes later the waitress came back.  By this time, my food started to look like something found on the side of the road.  I left it there and thought I should call the hazmat department for disposal.  We paid and left...and trust me...will NEVER GO BACK!!  Just as an added note, we were both sick to our stomachs last night!  Coincidence?  I think not!"}
{"text":"The girls at the front desk are rude. They obviously hate their job because they make sure everyone knows how unhappy they are. The food is decent but has gone down in the last few years."}
{"text":"I've been a few times now and I really don't get the appeal.  The place seems a little hodge-podge in their decor, the food isn't very good (not awful, but why go out and spend money on mediocre food?), and the service is pretty slow.  I've tried a couple different dishes and I'd prefer to go to a carry-out place for this type of \"mexican\" food.  My opinion, don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very good green chili (pork) burrito. Aka white sands burrito.  Some prices are good and some  on the high side. But overall affordable."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. I've visited this location numerous times as it's located near my office. Each time I've visited they're either understaffed, food order is incorrect or they're just plain rude. Not worth the effort.. I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"So disappointed today as only 1 star for the forever yummy bean dip. Our waiter I think only came by to drop the drinks, food and refill the drinks once. No extra chips, if we had wanted them, no asking if the food was good or how the meal was or if we wanted dessert.  Fyi only beans & rice were gone on my plate so maybe asking how it was he was scared. Mom's carnitas were nothing but a drop on top of a ton of cabbage which has never happened before however the manager did make it right, off the bill.   My guess we won't be back again.  So sad as this use 2 be a fav."}
{"text":"Food was okay today. Service was good. Today's visit just seemed to be a little off."}
{"text":"Horrible service from our waiter Dean. He checked on everyone else around us but ignored us. Ran into another waitress and spilled a tray of sodas in the middle of the tables. My phone and legs were soaked in soda. He didn't even ask if I needed a towel. I give them two stars because another waiter walking by offered me a towel. Food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Everything that I've had here has been good and is served very quickly! Chips, salsa and a bean dip are given to every table after being sat. Corona-margarita is delicious!"}
{"text":"Been there several times, but only because kids eat free Sundays and they have a clown there Sunday afternoons. Service is always lacking and the food is subpar at best. My kids sure love Footz though.  How about a few decent drink specials!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had one of the best meal we have had in a while. Not only was the food spectacular; but our Waitress Carmen, was excellent. She exceeded our expectations for this restaurant.  My boyfriend was craving Mexican Food and we decided to go to Arriba because it was close to our home. We went at Happy Hour which was from 4 to 7PM. Once we sat down, Carmen brings us chips, a bean dip, 1 mild and 1 hot salsa. That was great. I also had some questions with the menu as to what they have inside and how spicy were the chili peppers on the pictures mean. She told us like it is and because my boyfriend is a little picky with his burrito, she made sure it was done like how he wanted. We went to other restaurants and asked the same thing; they said they don't have this or that and when it comes out, it totally had this and that. So not good. We had a cheese crisp which was yummy, My boyfriend ordered straight beef burrito with sour cream and cheese on the side. I had the chimichanga with the white sauce. It had one jalepeno and because I can't eat spicy right now, she gave me a sample of the sauce (talk about great service) and it was okay by me. I wanted to finish everything but the portions were huge. Carmen also refilled our drinks every time we finished and when we were done, she offered to give us the drinks to go. I love that.  Anyway, you gotta try this place if you haven't and hopefully, you get Carmen. She deserved the big tip we gave her."}
{"text":"When we entered the wait staff was sitting in the entry and we stood there for awhile before we were even acknowledged. They did not even say HI. We were seated and again no notice we were there from anyone. About five minutes and the waiter dropped off stale chips, salsa, and bean dip at the table. We ordered water (DO NOT ORDER) even with lime it was awful. The food was average. I do not think we will be back."}
{"text":"Horrible sante de salad.  A huge amount of sour cream mixed with seemed to be old caramelized onions and lettuce.  No cheese.  Super dry crumbly strips of chicken breast that at first I was upset that there weren't more but after tasting the first one I was glad there were only four.  The only good thing was the guacamole.  Waiter and service was good.  I could only eat a part of this salad and still needed protein so we had to eat at another place after this."}
{"text":"For my first time it was pretty decent. Just as everyone said it is pretty pricey. I had the taco plate which consists of two tacos, seasoned rice & refried beans. My bill was 11.57 for that. Pretty steep considering that usually runs $7 most places. But I can say 3 hours later I am still full as if I just left the table. The chips, salsa, & refried beans appetizer was a great start to meal as well. My friends have already planned the next visit in which I will try the swirled strawberry/mango margarita which is 24 oz for 6.99. Sounds like a steal. I hope the flavor is above the price."}
{"text":"I didn't get my drink till 16 mins into my visit. Leticia was my server & didn't bring me anything I asked for. She only got my chips & salsa & refill. Don't come here at all. It's a waste of time & money on some bad service & nasty food. Everything is soaked in grease juice"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice, both dates were very distant from each other.   The first time I went there my cheese quesadilla was delicious! I really loved the taste of the tortillas. The chips and salsa were okay. But the table and dishes that were waiting for us were dirty. I was a little grossed out by this and it made me think about how clean other areas (ie. the kitchen) would be.   The 2nd time I went the tables and dishes were, again, dirty. I had a sticky streak of something right in front of me on the table, I put a napkin on top of it to avoid it because it wouldn't wipe off. There was also some unidentifiable specks on the little chip plate, I just put that a side. And, sadly, this time my quesadilla was not very good. The cheese was barely melted and it made the texture gritty, which is not pleasant! Chips were just okay again."}
{"text":"We are hungry, we do not want to go on an expedition. We want spicy, cheesy goodness. And a margarita. We decide to hit up Arriba's since they're just up the street, and per our usual chill demeanor, sidle up to the little bar to grab a margarita, and decide what spicy green chile dishes we want to eat.   Now, I haven't been to this place in a couple years, and the last time I went, was driven there, half in the bag after watching a softball tournament. At that time, maybe I didn't care so much, maybe it was because I couldn't see the bartender making my drinks, I don't know....BUT  If you are a *new* bartender, don't upsell me a handmade margarita with Cuervo, instead of your house concoction that comes out of a tap,  use the small side of the jigger to pour said tequila into one of those ridiculous tiny cactus margarita glasses, haphazardly salted, expect me to pay $6 for tiny little glass and crappy pour, and somehow appreciate that you have any understanding of what it means to make a good margarita - you know, one where the orange from the triple sec lightly dances with the tequila flavors rising above the  sweet and sour and the tang of fresh lime juice - especially when you still haven't given me a menu, and are now serving jiggerless poured Crown and diets and Jack and diets to your 21 and a half-year old friends who are leaning all over the bar with slithering arrogance and no sense of personal space (yes, I can smell your drugstore perfume, and no, it doesn't make you pretty).  So, no, I don't want this crappy tiny margarita, and no, I don't even think I want to eat here.   We went to La Pinata instead, because that's what we should have done in the first place."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience!   Great Margaritas, awesome happy hour, fajitas were perfect, cheese dip was outstanding.   Guess you could say, it was Great!  Great service!"}
{"text":"Be careful with this place!!!! We were there on Sunday, August 31, 2014, and we had just sat down, and our plates were dirty there was dry food on the plates.  As we placed our order my daughter felt something fly through her hair!!! She shook her hair as she did that she saw a big, I mean big cockroach on the floor!!!!!!! It ran under the table next to us!!!! We stood up to leave and told the waiter to cancel our order because we saw a roach and we were leaving... He didn't seem too concerned and got an attitude with my daughter!!!!!! We are never ever going back!!!!   I give this a thumbs down!!! This is totally disgusting!!! This place doesn't even deserve one star!!!"}
{"text":"what happened to this place. just had lunch there.  food awful.  there was bean dip on the menu, the chimichanga had no meat in it.  gives this chain one more year at most"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Mexican food has to me my favorite type of food and Arriba is for sure at the top of my list for Mexican restaurants! This is a New Mexican style restaurant with lots of hatch green chilies in their dishes. You can also buy them fresh from here by the pound during the month of August.   I have eaten here probably 30+ times and they are always consistent. The chips are always fresh and warm  they serve two different salsas as well as bean dip. All three are the bomb! My favorite item on the menu is the whitesands chimichanga. Do not order this though if you can't handle spicy stuff. but if you are like me, the spicier the better, then go with this!   Everyday they have good lunch specials. I like to go on Thurs because they have chimis for $1.99. For an extra dollar they will smother it with the white sands sauce. What a deal! And on Sunday they have kids day with a clown that makes animal balloons. And best of all, kids eat free!   And if your a beer drinker they have a microbrewery too. I'm not a beer drinker though so I can't tell you how good it is. But the margaritas are on point!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because the food was good like usual from arribas.  As soon as you walk in to this location you can immediately smell the sewage smell.  Our server at first was OK but gradually lost any sort of customer service etiquette.   Reaching over your food,  getting the bill all mixed up and an apparent look of frustration.   Won't be visiting this location again!"}
{"text":"The environment and atmosphere was good,  but the food was well below average.   I ordered the omelet and it was saturated with onions.   My husband was very disappointed with his chili verde plate....too many jalapeños and very little pork for the price.   Not likely to come back."}
{"text":"We waited too long to try this place, it's a hidden gem next to a Walmart. It was great, steak fajitas and cheese crisps."}
{"text":"I love this place and the closes I can get to New Mexico enchiladas. It don't taste the same but close enough being I'm from New Mexico it's good."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Uncaring manager. Mediocre food. First and last time here. I should have checked yelp."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Service was the WORST ever. Waitress stopped at the table just long enough to ask if everything was alright, not even long enough for our response. When taking our order she didn't listen half the time and got half of our order wrong. Multiple staff walking by looking at our table with a stack of dishes and empty glasses...nobody seemed to care to ask if we needed anything. Staff all looked miserable. They won't get our business anymore"}
{"text":"I used to live in New Mexico and have been searching for Mexican food that came close to the flavor and heat of the hatch chilies used there...until I found Arriba on Camelback. I love spicey food and theirs in the hottest in town (the menu has a \"hot\" factor so you can avoid the heat if you want). My fiance and I always start out with the queso fundito and then take our pick of the rest of the amazing menu. I recommend the Roswell Tacos and the Spinach Enchiladas.   I have been to other Arriba locations but this one has the hottest food, best ambiance, and service."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed... the food was so lacking there n everything... bartender was just rude off the bat! We have always chose Arriba , this location is so not the same place.  I will say our waitress was very nice and polite."}
{"text":"Some of the best New Mexican food that I've ever tasted. Friendly staff, tasty beer made on premises, and very clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Hey, it's typical Mexican fare, so don't expect gourmet. Atmosphere is family-friendly, gives you nachos to munch on; spicy bean dip--YUM! and salsa--while you are waiting for your food. They pretty much leave you alone to eat, which I am thankful for...One standout is that Raul our server was on time when we wanted anything and had it right to us. Chicken tostado soup to die for. The strawberry margarita was actually pretty good. All in all- a good place to have close by. -- I like it. I'll be baaahhhck. - :)"}
{"text":"This place has been for many years now. Obviously, many people must love it. I can't say that I love it.  But, I like it. A few years ago, I was here for lunch and got some type of creamy item. I got food poisoning .I never wanted to go back. However, I came here with my friend for lunch because, she wanted to go here. So this time it was a lovely experience. I got the fish tacos ,nothing creamy. They were very good!! Very good. My friend got some combo dish with lots of sauces on top. But, she was totally healthy after eating it. She thought it was divine. The chips and salsa or also very good.  The service was great. The manager even came over and talk to us. We were sitting in front of the fireplace and he even turned it on for us. With the rain and cold outside it was so nice and comfortable. So I'm going to say, that I do  like Arriba's, And that I  would definitely return. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with lots of colorful paint. As well as cool artwork. Lots of parking all the way around the building"}
{"text":"I just walked out of this place.  This location continues to struggle with its customer service.  I walked in and sat at the bar hoping to watch some of the game.  I sat there waiting for the bartender.  Several other wait staff looked at me several times and walked away.  No one even brought chips, you know this is usually the quickest part at a Mexican Restaurant.  Highly annoyed at this point I got up and walked out.  On my way out I let the hostess know to let her manager know that after waiting for a bit and not even being acknowledged I'm am leaving."}
{"text":"This was pretty darn awesome!!!  I went here with my roomie a couple months ago, and this place rocks!!  I was full from the free chips and salsa before I ate my enchilladas, though...  :P  My roomie ordered the Margarita for two people, and when our server brought it to our table, my eyes were so wide from how large the drink was!!!  We couldn't even drink the whole thing, because my roommate had to drive, and I couldn't drink the whole thing myself!  I think it was only $8.00 for that large Margarita, too, unlike the $12.00 you spend for a tiny drink in Old Town Scottsdale (yes, there is a time for Old Town Scottsdale too, though.  :P).  The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean, the staff is friendly, and I left full and happy.  This is definitely a place that you should go and check out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visit Arriba on a weekly basis! Their queso is amazing and they have a great happy hour menu!! And who doesn't love complimentary chips, salsa and beans?! Love it!"}
{"text":"Average to overpriced, slow service, and the food was average.  In short, we'll be trying many other places before we might consider giving Arriba another shot.  We were there during the week, I believe on a Tuesday during the lunch hour.  At least once we had to ask for refills...and then wait some more.  There were 4 of us that had a variety of dishes, none of which were great, ranging from \"alright\" to \"I wouldn't try it again\"."}
{"text":"Awesome food. First time here so I can't guarantee all the items, but what I tried makes me think the menu is promising. Wow. Yum. And they have a daily special that's happy hour prices. Not to mention the awesome chips and dip (mild, hot hot, and spicy bean dip) that come out as soon as u sit. Yum!"}
{"text":"Geez what's up with these places ???  Been coming to Arriba's few times... different times if it isn't one thing it's another.... food not well cooked , dirty utensils , charged for food I did not order things like that... The last time I brought my SIs in law's Family for a celebration ... nope It was like pulling teeth from the Waitress. She had an attitude , brought the wrong food, it took almost 45 minutes for everyone to eat dinner. I still gave the waitress a 10 tip and told her \" Boy here is your 10 tip you don't deserve it and I'm sorry for coming here and it is the last time coming here and stay home if you have a bad day ,don't take it on the Customers\" . Sorry , Arriba Mexican Grill this place looks like it's going  \" Abajo Mexican Grill \" .  See ya,  taking my Money somewhere else .... $$$"}
{"text":"Every time we eat at Arriba we say it will be the last time, then a year or so goes by and we end up going there again, but after tonight, we will not ever go again.   The food has declined in quality and flavor, I don't know how I can forget this each time. But even worse, the service tonight was truly terrible. We had 2 other tables in our area, but the waitress never noticed when a drink was empty, kept forgetting our orders for drinks from the bar and sides, then after we were finished eating, we sat for a good 30 minutes before she asked if we were ready for the check. So three tables and the waitress could not keep up. She may be new but truly needs additional training.   We will not be back again, sadly, because our area is really lacking in good restaurants."}
{"text":"Best hidden breakfast/brunch place in Gilbert on the weekends.  They start you off with chips, salsa and bean dip.   You can't beat the Bacon and  Eggs breakfast with Two eggs, two strips of country style bacon. Served with country potatoes and two buttermilk pancakes.  All for $5.99.   Usually no wait at the door like Denny's or Ihop.  Nice relaxing Mexican Cantina theme with Mariachi or Country music playing in the background.  Very relaxing brunch to start your day off right.  Not to mention they brew their own beer with a nice bar and have the Cards games on game days.  We love the food and the service.   http://www.arribamexicangrill.com/breakfast_menu.php"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  I had the green chili stew.   It was very peppery and hit the spot.  Standard fare Mexican food.  Our server Alexandria was really good and attentive.  Place was busy and the staff all work together to insure you get a good experience.  Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Okay I know this is a chain, but I had to review because I was expecting average service and food. First off superb service from the hostess to the waiter to servers to table clean up crew. Now onto food, I usually stay away from places like this because they seem to offer the same bland overcooked food (i.e. Macayos, Manuels, Pancho's), but everyone in our group enjoyed their meal. We will most likely visit whenever we're in this part of town again."}
{"text":"Worst service and their margaritas are nothing but ice and sugar! $6.99 for a slurpee flavored \"margarita?\" My husband and son had got there before me and when he went to sit himself (in a booth) in the bar area he was basically chased down and told him he could only sit in the table tops since there was only 2 of them and he said, no we have someone else joining us. Long story short, they had been seated a good 10mins by the time I joined them and no one had even came by to get drink orders or even welcome them, other than the hostess what chased him down. So 5 mins later a gentleman drops off chips and salsa along with bean dip and takes our drink orders and we start with a cheese crisp,' took 8 mins to get the drinks and an additional 11 mins just for a cheese crisp! Our poor waiter was nice but he had way too many tables to attend throughout the entire restaurant, not just in bar area. He was drenched in sweat which grossed us out but he was polite, overworked and could not be attentive due to the place being understaffed, from our observation. Both our frozen margaritas had chunks of ice from not being mixed properly and pure sugar in taste. My husband had his remade and it was mediocre afterwards bit definitely nothing too exciting. Needless to say, we won't be back~"}
{"text":"Pretty good grub. The atmosphere is quite festive, the prices are fairly low, I've never had to wait for a table, and the service has always been friendly and attentive. Yes, I am mexican so I know authentic mexican food, and I've even taken my parents here, and my own father who is the king of Chile had a hard time handling the heat from their Hatch chiles. Man those things have some kick to them! if you like spicy, give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is 1 of my sister's favor8 places but not quite mine. She luvs spicy, me not so much (a li'l kick does me fine, but more than that kick's my (_y_) & there's not much 4 those like me 2 select from off their menu). Most everything including entrees & appetizers has their sign8ture hatch chili's in/on it which is just 2 much 4 me.     Last time we went here 4 her B~day celebr8ion she didn't touch anything on her pl8 but took it home 4 l8r. She was more focused on nursing her gargantuan margaritas so her fascin8ion may also b w/ the drink specials.     I ordered some breaded mushrooms, a side of guacamole 2 go w/ my chips & had the spinach enchiladas w/ a chile rellano side. The chips w/ guac & bean dip were actually the best of what I had. Mushrooms were ok but over~fried & bland, the enchiladas were good but WAY 2 Salty & the rellano was drenched in sauce that tasted kinda fishy 4 some reason (perhaps cross contamin8ion) which was unexpected & not the most complimentary flavors 2gether but still decent.     Our w8er kept missing details & tho I know he was busy & seemed nice 4 the most part, he still could have made things a bit better knowing we were there 4 a special occasion. We ordered a special sopapilla churro dessert they were promoting 4 my sister because we wanted 2 c her @ least eat (instead of drink) something. It showed a large mint green choc chip scoop of ice~cream pictured in the center w/ choc sauce drizzled over but she got a small scoop of vanilla in center w/ no chocol8 topping. I don't trust sending food back (especially after seeing the movie Waiting) so I asked him 2 pls bring the correct ice~cream in a small bowl which was the 5th detail he missed while w8ing on our small party.     So overall not good nor bad, so it'll most likely stay a place I go 2 only when it's my sister's B~day choice as I really don't care 2 spend my hard~earned $$ on average food, service, &/or experience in a somewhat outd8ed interior. Maybe that's why they push the enormous drink specials so much cuz then no1 would care but I hardly drink~like 2 experience things in their entirety so here's my take..."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Overtime it's become less flavorful. The service is horrible. Very slow. The person the delivered our food asked if we need anything else, I asked for more tea, and she never came back. Our waiter was nonexistent. If you want good food, good times, and good service this is not the place for that."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday with my honey and our toddler for an early dinner yesterday. As others have stated- it was pretty empty. Maybe 5 other tables- but it was about 3pm so in between meals.  Server came over timely and was very nice. Food and ritas came out quickly- and everything was correct. Taste was fine- nothing amazing spectacular, but it was good. I'm sure we will come back."}
{"text":"Pay attention to the poor reviews on here, because they are spot on.  Our party of four had an awful experience. For starters the server was not happy to be there and not attentive to our table. There was a problem with the Coke, but he brought us out nasty tasting Cokes anyways. We told him that the Coke was off and he told us that there was a problem with the machine. That left us wondering why he brought us the Cokes when he knew they were bad.   It only got worse from there as we waited forever for our food. It was seriously over an hour after we ordered before our food arrived, and when it did it was cold and wasn't made properly. We had to send it back because of that, but when they brought out the food again it seemed like it was the same food that had probably been microwaved as my friend felt the taco shell. It was really gross and we had to speak to the manager as we were not going to eat that. He disappeared on us for awhile, but he finally came back and apologized and removed the bill. We were still disappointed though, because it was a waste of time and we left hungry."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for some good Mexican food and decided to go here! Not the right choice with so many others in the area. First you notice the sign out front that they are hiring servers! The service was horrible and it was an obvious reflection of their management team. We stood in the middle of the patio area for awhile while they hunted down the busser who could not keep up and was not taught how to bus tables. The waiter would take the dirty dishes and move them to other tables so he would have stacks setting around. This was so unappetizing while we were dining. When we were seated there was no table service so we had to retrieve our own. I went on to order the chicken fajitas and they were so dry and the onions were burnt. I would not recommend spending your hard earned dollars here. I certainly do not intend on going back."}
{"text":"Worst Arriba's Ever! We were so excited to have an Arriba's on this side of town yet both times we went to the Goodyear location it sucked! Service is pathetic. On our last visit we walked in to see the Manager and bartender just hanging out talking . We sat at our table for 10 minutes before going to the bar to ask for our own drinks only to find noone working.  (Could clearly hear them in the kitchen)The waitress made eye contact with us at one point, ran a few drinks to a table and walked right past us and sat in a booth to have a few bites of her meal. She returned to serve us about 5 minutes later. About the time she rudely asked \"do u know what u want\", as if we were an inconvenience, we got up and left.  We will not return. Ever. Bad management. Bad service."}
{"text":"man they have went down hill over the years they use to have the best salsa and it was hot now in just as mild as the rest guamoley was bla the fajitas were were over so it made them tuff  server was OK wasn't the friendliest just going thru the motion"}
{"text":"This has always been of our favorite places until the last two visits.  We took some friends that were visiting from out of the area.   They said the food was good, but way too salty.  We thought maybe they were sensitive to salt, but then when we had the same experience at another location I knew something had changed.  The food is become extremely too salty.   Yesterday we were at the Scottsdale location and had to return our grilled fish filet, because it was not edible.  Even the beans and rice were too salty.  I tried to contact them via their website but it is not working.   I hope they see this review and make some changes."}
{"text":"Went there for Fathers Day brunch and food was really good. Only disappointment was how bad the service was from our waitress Raelene. She took forever to bring us our drinks, didn't tell us about the buffet, we had to get info ourselves. She never came back to check on our table so we never got any refills. I saw her check on the tables around us so can't give blame it on being busy."}
{"text":"I would think for the prices they charge they could invest in a couple slings for a baby carrier. I have a 2 month old and my options were to set her on the ground or put her car seat on the chair. When I asked for a high chair I was told it wasn't stable. Even in n out burger and McDonald's has options to accommodate baby carriers...I will leave a large tip and hopefully they can afford to buy one."}
{"text":"This was our first time there and it was so awesome. The 2 dollar margaritas during happy hour were great and the appetizers were all half price. The nachos were really good. Our waiter Matt was totally cool and took care of us, even though the place was packed. Highly recommend! !"}
{"text":"ATTENTION VEGETARIANS: my boyfriend and I payed $15 for 2 really huge delicious vegan burritos.  However Half way thru my burrito was a HUGE CHUNK OF CARNITAS aka shredded pork I couldn't tell if they were being assholes or they are just too fucking stupid to make a burrito without dead animal Caracas in it. It really pissed me off and I am never going back!  On a good note the guacamole and chips and salsas were fantastic. Our waiter was very friendly as well. The bill was cheap for the amount of food we ordered.   Vegetarians beware. Meat eaters: you're gonna enjoy arribas!"}
{"text":"This place is OK. It is a cross between Mexican fast food and a restaurant. The food is a little above average but I think costs a little too much. I would think with the volume of customers they have they could do better in both categories.   My only real complaint is that the waitress asked \"sour cream and guacamole on the side\". This made it sound like it was included but just being placed on the side, as opposed to the top of the food. When the bill came it was $1.00 for the sour cream and $1.25 for the guacamole."}
{"text":"I enjoy their food so much and their service is amazing. I love that you can actually get hot spicy food. Normally Mexican restaurants, I have a hard time finding spicy foods. The hatch chicken espesial is the best!"}
{"text":"Decent but typical Phoenix area Mexican food.  Very comparable to Garcia's and Macayo's type of food.  We went on Sunday for kids eat free.  After sticker shock, yes I thought it was pretty over priced we  ordered.  My taco salad was $11, and my wife's lunch was similarly priced for 2 enchiladas.  The kid's cheese crisp was humongous.  Portions in general were pretty large.  Taco salad was good and fresh, but you could taste the oil in the shell.  Cheese on the cheese crisp, and daughter's enchilada was excessively oily.  Excluding the oily cheese and the prices it wasn't that bad.  We would go back again.  They seem to have some decent specials."}
{"text":"I love Arribas and never had an issue here. Love the fact you get Spicy bean dip with your chips."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo overpriced and they are not consistent in their food quality or service. I fell in love with their queso fundido and ordered it all the time, to go. The first year they were opened, I ordered a quart at a time, which cost a whopping $18.99, but it came with a large bag of tortilla chips free, so that made it a little more bearable. I ordered 1-2 quarts of this stuff at least 3 times a month, every month, for close to a year, and every time it came with a large bag of chips for each quart I ordered. Over time, the consistency of the product fluctuated wildly....one time it would be mild and barely had any heat, while the next time it was so hot I could not even eat it. This went on and got to the point that I stopped ordering it because I did not know if it would be so hot that I would have to throw it away, so I just gave up. It has been about a year since I last ordered and tonight I decided to try it again. I called to place my to-go order for a quart of queso fundido tonight, assuming the large bag of chips came with it, as always. I was so angry when I was told that the chips were no longer complimentary but now cost $5.00 a bag! That is over $25 after tax for a container of cheese dip and some chips! I did not order and I will not be going back there again.....EVER! I spoke to a manager and she said that is the policy and she cannot give me the chips like before so I just told her to forget the order. The manager could/should have offered me the large bag of chips free, like before, since she could clearly hear that it was very upsetting to me.....she could have saved a customer....but over what amounts to probably 30 cents in product, she lost a customer forever and I will just go to the other Mexican restaurant the next exit up. Almost everything on their menus is way overpriced.....6 ounces of carne asada with a little rice and beans is $16.99!!! That is absurd! 6 ounces??? That is an extremely small portion to be charging $16.99. The rest of their menu is similar in quantity and being overpriced. I am over this corporate greed! I will make the stupid queso dip at home for a tenth of the price and not have to worry about whether it will be so hot that I will need a fire extinguisher in the bathroom the next morning!"}
{"text":"I have never written a poor review on any establishment until now. 2 weeks prior to Cinco de Mayo, I made a reservation for 15 people at 4:00. When we arrived, all that was set up were a bunch of tables. No silverware, no napkins. My friends and I say in a somewhat empty restaurant for 45 minutes until I had to get up and ask the hostess for service. At that point, we all received waters. 5 minutes later we received chips in a bowl with no napkins. We waited a full hour until someone took our drink order. We only stayed because we really had no choice. Who else was going to accommodate 15 people at 5:00 on cinco de mayo? Finally, at 5:20, I asked to speak to the manager. We still hadn't received a single drink, our chips and water had gone dry. I explained the situation, she explained to us that they were \"Very busy and what, exactly, would I like her to do?\" Well, we asked for a free round. She told us they would arrive right away and then never returned. At that point, no longer in the holiday spirit, I called the nearby pub, Skeptical Chymist, and asked if they could accommodate 15 very hungry and thirsty people. \"With pleasure\" they replied and we all walked out. I have never felt so ignored or mistreated by a restaurant. Shame on them!"}
{"text":"A huge disappointment? Why? Their prices are very high considering the place is just \"ordinary\" and no different than a neighborhood mexican restaurant. Their roasted chilis are \"passable\". They werent as HOT as i hoped they would be. I could get better quality at Food City.  Since they advertise on TV, i expected more..............not knowing that we will end up feeling like we just ate our usual mexican food at our usual mexican diner.  A lot of marketing hype.................so maybe that is why the prices are high...........to cover the huge costs of TV commercials. Not worth it. A HUGE disappointment. Dont wanna go back. If i want to spend good money i would rather spend it on food that isnt just bordering on ORDINARY,"}
{"text":"Was a bit dissapointed after reading reviews here! I had the fijitas, wife had tacos. Didnt think the inferno  (green hatch chili)was all that hot!!! The Taco meat was not spiced bland. Best part of the meal was the bean dip and chips even the salsa was nothing great!!! At least the beer was cold   ut at 13.00 a pitcher it better be!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is ok. The food at this location is better than others. Tortilla soup is great here"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  I went with my husband, and as always he ordered a bean burrito, it was very bland and way over priced.  I had a chicken and a beef taco, the chicken was horrible, and the beef was very dry.  For desert we ordered apple chimichangas which were very good, but how could you mess up deep fried apples and tortillas dipped in cinammon and sugar.  The only  thing good I have to say about this place is that every time I ordered a beer the waitress brought me one immediately and then about 20 minutes later the busboy would bring another out to me thinking I never received the first, either way, no matter how drunk I got the food never tasted good.   I would never go here again."}
{"text":"Love love the happy hour! Cheap margaritas & great salsa & bean dip with chips!!!!! Always our go-to place when we're craving a little Mexican"}
{"text":"Love love the bean dip, chips & salsa! Very good chicken tortilla soup too!  Food seems to be consistent with other locations; service sometimes a bit sluggish, but we keep returning for the bean dip especially"}
{"text":"Oh Arriba, how I miss thee! We just moved from AZ to MN, and what we can't find . . . good Mexican (or New Mexican, as some of Arriba's dishes are). My absolute favorite dish is the Rio Grande Enchiladas - the spicy meat, the cheese - mmmm!   We recently went to the Arriba in Tempe (or Awatukee?) and the service was awful, but our typical Arriba is Phoenix, and the service is good."}
{"text":"First, this place is dirty.  Food slung on the walls not cleaned up. Place looks old.  TVs are so old .. why have them in the bar when the picture is distorted?  Next ... I had to send my food back twice.  First time the chimichanga was doughy and not cooked all the way thru, and I asked for sour cream on side, which they did.  2nd order came out, they put the sour cream on my chimichanga ... not good considering I'm allergic to it.  So I had to send it back again.  However, the beer was cold, chips were good, salsa good, bartender was good.  I won't be back till they update and clean the place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley, seriously! The atmosphere is great, first off. So much personality in the colors, paintings, plants, and other unique Mexican decorating accents. I knew it was a cool place the first time I went there as soon as I saw the Frida Kahlo painting on the wall that you see when you first walk in. There is always someone  smiling to greet you and take you to your seat, which I've never had to wait for.   It is quite a large place, and each room is decorated differently - one room even has a mural-type painting on the walls of a scene in a charming-looking Latin American town. The waitresses wear dresses that reflect their culture.   I noticed instantly that most of the customers were of Hispanic descent (a really good sign!) and that the staff had thick accents. I felt like maybe I wasn't in the States anymore!   Oh yea, and the food is SSSSOOOOO good. I like it that their menu has a photo of every single meal they serve. That rocks! And, they have levels of spiciness for the hotter dishes on the menu -- five chili peppers next to the description means you better be able to handle the heat they serve!!"}
{"text":"The only thing worthy of a taste was they had a bean dip that actually some jalepeno spice. Other than that nothing was worth eating. Talk about bland no flavor mx. food this is it. If all u want is cheap this is your place. Might as well eat at Filbertos."}
{"text":"Last time I was in, I enjoyed my meal.  I really like a good green chili cheese burger.  I ordered a medium rare green chili cheese burger.  A well done burger was dilivered with no chili and no cheese.  The waiter tried to make it right. My conclusion is the foid is highly variable.  I tip well.  When it was all said and done it was 42 dollors for two cheese burgers and two beers.  I did not enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"We love this place and have been coming here for years, but today was a little different. What made the difference? It was our waitress Jordan. She was such a nice person and seemed to really care about all her tables. She was TERRIFIC, and I made sure to contact Arriba's manager just to let her know how great & caring she was. After seeing how thirsty I was because of some Hatch Chili Queso, she even brought me 2 Diet Cokes. Who does that? As always, my Wife and I think Arriba's is the best, and plan to come here for many more years."}
{"text":"Street tacos are not good but salsa and chips are awesome as well as taco salad! Atmosphere is ok and manager was willing to give a replacement meal for the nasty street tacos!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I spent $15.95 for the Carnitas plate. I'm a Carnitas fan and I order it whenever I try a new Mexican restaurant.  What I got was a mound of onions with pork scattered through it (and very sparsely I might add).  The best carnitas I've had to date was at two different restaurants in Goodyear: Raul & Theresa's and Manuel's. Both were quite good with Raul & Theresa's winning the gold.  The service at Arriba was decent. The decor decent. However I was extremely disappointed in the pricing and the skimpiness of their kitchen. When I order food I want FOOD. I don't want onions in my carnitas (actually it was a little carnitas in my onions).  Hey if you're an ONION fan and you want to pay $15.95 a plate for them then be my guest. However if you are a CARNITAS fan don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"I usually listen to that little voice that says turn around and get outta there after... 1. The person moping the floor turns out to be the waiter. 2.The waiter/janitor leaves the mop bucket and without introduction  asks what do you want?  3. The table utensils need a good wipe down before use. 4. The fajitas have a grey color and no sizzle. Listen to that little voice."}
{"text":"Update from Oct-2012: I figured...certainly they would have evolved into a better restaurant. Wrong, wrong, wrong! I had high hopes that they would have fixed the service. Nope. In all fairness to our server, he had too many tables in his section and was hustling to try and keep up. Still, that's always been the problem inconsistent service. This must be a management issue. I go to the Arriba's on Camelback on a regular basis and always had great service. Astala N. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"after reviewing there online menu and being the first time eating here . I called to place my order for pick up. I ordered the daily special but was told by the manager I would HAVE to eat it in the restaurant! When I asked her why she told me she didn't know and I should call corporate. I called corporate and got an answering machine. The manager refused to put it in a to go box unless I pay regular price. Regular price is $5.00 more. This is poor business and makes no sense! I will never try to give them my business again!"}
{"text":"Reviewing this is hard. They used to be my favorite places to go. I loved the fajitas. However the portions get smaller every time and the service gets worse and worse. I love the hatch chili but sometimes they forget it and don't bring it to me. They don't refill the drinks and you never see the waiters or waitresses. It wouldn't be so bad but it cost about sixty dollars every time we go there. If I'm paying I want good service and not tiny portions. We've stopped going here because it is no longer worth the price. Like I said it USED to be my favorite but no longer. Going to fast food Mexican is more satisfying because at least I'm not out a lot of money. I love good Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Arriba'S in Glendale is awesome! The best happy hour! The food is amazing! Hector and Logan in the bar are awesome! Chris, the manager always stops by the table to make sure all is OK. My favorite Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 5 years for brunch. Good mimosa's and a nice breakfast/brunch selection."}
{"text":"Ordered the Stuffed Chicken Breast and it was very unique and delicious! It consisted of a chicken breast stuffed with jalapeño cream cheese, sautéed (fajita style) vegetables & topped with queso fundido. Very rich and creamy. I'd order it again because I've never seen anything like it anywhere else.   Our server was Lance and he was great. He was very knowledgable about the menu and he kept up with everything we needed.   The only area of improvement is the chips and salsa. The salsa was just okay and the chips were a tad stale...but I still ate a ton of them.   I'd go back next time I visit Arizona!"}
{"text":"Ate a late lunch early dinner here February 1st 2016.  Had never been to this chain before.  Was pleasantly surprised.  Salsa and chips almost before we sat down.  The salsa had a bite to it which was unlike other chain restaurants and it was very good.  Service was very good and our food arrived \"hot\" and in record time.  It was almost as if they knew what we were going to order before we got there which might suggest that they had quantities prepared awaiting service.  If that's the case then we couldn't tell the difference and actually believe the kitchen was on top of their game.  The food seemed fresh and was very tasty.  All in all, we would go back."}
{"text":"Yuck! This wasn't our first choice for dinner and should've waited the hour to get a table at Los Dos Molinos. Anyways, we ended up here and thought we would give it a shot. We started off with the tortilla soup which was pretty good. The chips and salsa were pretty good too. I ordered carnitas. My meal was so bland. How do you mess up carnitas? I had a huge plate of food but it was mostly consisted of lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, ect. There was hardly anything else, not that I would've eaten it anyways. So I we decided to order deep fried ice cream and disappointment hit again. It was ice vanilla ice cream with corn flakes sprinkled on the top. Unbelievable! Well now we know and we will never go back there again!"}
{"text":"My family chose this spot to get some take out tonight and I was extremely underwhelmed. I got the arriba Trio especial because the chicken and shrimp sounded really good. I mean who doesn't like chicken covered in Queso and Shrimps wrapped in Bacon?! Sadly though when I got my food at home there was no queso on my chicken at all, just a sad plain grilled chicken breast, and 3 severely over fried shrimp, that were quite honestly inedible. We live about 20 mins from this spot so it's too far to take the food back so I just ate it how it was. The chicken while plain was actually cooked well (Hence the few stars I gave) and the quesadilla was alright. Everyone else enjoyed their food, I just got stuck with the short end of the stick tonight I guess. While I would be willing to give this place a shot again, I can't say I'll be expecting anything great from there after this experience."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have had at an Arribas.  I cannot believe the lack of service or concern for the staff.  My wife's soup had avocado slices that had black patches on them.  When she brought to our server's attention all she said was do you want new ones..."}
{"text":"The food and drink special were GREAT, but the service was not! I believe the service makes half the experience when going out to eat and the hostess was rude and our server was not too friendly, but it may have been because she was serving like 5 or 6 tables and was way too rushed."}
{"text":"Had a good experience the last time I was in but this time the food was bland and it seemed they opened a can of tomato and just dumped it on the food. I will not go back to that one. Also it tasted like the salsa was store bought."}
{"text":"Absolute fucking garbage! It only got a star because i couldn't put zero stars! This is a disgrace of a place to get Mexican food! Service was terrible and they can't split a check? Its not that hard to do so honestly considering everything is in a system! Never coming back here ever! Absolutely horrid!"}
{"text":"Hey friends it's Analynn , if you all get a chance grab your Amigos and head on out to Arriba's . Enjoy their frozen margaritas ! I had the Mango , delicious yo! Food was very tasty and we were seated right away. Our server was very good and so are the prices .  It's Friday live a little Enjoy !"}
{"text":"After finding myself in a 50 minute wait for sushi and hunger pains greater than I have ever experienced, I had to make a choice. So, it was to the generic Mexican restaurant.  Arriba's has ok food, but somewhat slowish service. That actually didn't matter too much with friends and family around. The margeritas are just OK and someone in my party had to send his back several times because it was like lighter fluid. Yuck.  I think next time I might wait in the 50 minute line, but you should definately try this place on for size. Hopefully, you will have a better experience."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever experienced we had to talk to them 3 times to finally get a iced water the drinks came at least 30 minutes later we ran out of chips and only got one small bowl for 7 people I am very heated of the service this place was very great years ago.    Attend Macayos"}
{"text":"I have to give 3 stars because I have been to different locations and have tried many different meals all which have not been very good. We will go on Sunday's when kids eat free which is not often. We always get the same thing a shredded chicken burrito plate.   We stick to what we know here. Chips are okay, salsa ok my kids really like the bean dip. Interior is nicely decorated. We've always been seated promptly and staff has been mediocre"}
{"text":"BEST CHIPS AND SALSA/BEAN DIP IN TOWN!  Among the great food the service is good too! Always getting refills on drinks and chips. We come here regularly! Great spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks for happy hour. Fox News was playing on all TVs in the bar area, which killed the vibe. Probably won't go back due to that mood killer. Politics don't belong in bars."}
{"text":"I love Arriba's! We were seated out on the patio by the beautiful rock covered waterfalls!! Served promptly! I ordered the Green chile Burrito plate with Spanish rice and retried beans. The food was exactly what I expected! Delicious! My daughter ordered a coconut smoothie and it wasn't to her liking and our amazing waitress, Bailey, proactively offered her the strawberry smoothie...which tickled her little taste buds just right! Lol Bailey was very personable and accommodating as always! Great job! Just forgot our Silverware ;) I guess you can't have everything! Lol"}
{"text":"Friday night I try to check in for 8 guest and the hostess with purple /blue hair (which is totally not for the restaurant business)  gives me this look like I'm not from this planet. She tells me I don't think we can accommodate 8 people.  I say well how long is the wait she says an hour and half to 2 hours. Okay we are fine with that we enjoy the food enough to wait the time. She continues to look at me with a stupid look. I said so can I put my name on this list and she goes \"I guess it's kind of a long time to wait isn't it\"  I said that's fine we don't mind waiting. she then says \"okayyyyy\" at this point I don't feel welcome in this restaurant I then ask her \" we can leave if you like us to leave and not wait\" she then says \" it's up to you but it's a long time\" Arribas if you have people willing to wait 2 hours to eat at your restaurant you make them feel welcome. You ask them can we get you waters while you wait or something. I am floored. I work in the restaurant business and I would never treat a guest willing to wait the way that hostess did. Such a shame your business lost out on good money from us. By the way we ended up going to red lobster where they made us feel welcome. Yes we waited the hour and a half."}
{"text":"You  know you have to rate a place when you start craving it... which is the case with Arriba Mexican Grill. The first time I was there it was good but, nothing amazing, I just simply did not order the thing that I like the most.  I went here and ordered an enchilada dish (can't remember what it was called) with chicken, sour cream with a green sauce, and was blown away, it is some of the best mexican I've had since I moved here from Canada.  They also have fantastic complimentary salsa and bean dip with chips when you sit down, and to top that all off $1.00 margaritas (yes I said $1.00) during happy hour before 6:00 pm... can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Decent food, really good hot salsa, but the prices are RIDIC. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Normally,  Arribas is one of our favorite places to eat but this location was awful. The food was OK but the service was the worst we've seen, from the waitress, to the bar tender, to management. We regularly eat at the Goodyear location and would never come back to this location. Additionally,  the margaritas were not even close to as good as the ones in Goodyear.  The parking lot is a disaster and handicap access not desirable. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Business has slowed for a lot of restaurants in the valley, the good news you may not have to,wait long to be seated!  This is a different than what I call AZ/Mex, this is more original New Mexico cuisine. There is enough heat if you want it, by adding more New Mexican hatch chiles. My favorite dish is the stacked enchiladas with beef red sauce, my wife's new favorite is the green chili burro. I have to take a bite every time we go.   I love that there's one in Gilbert now, we are exactly in the middle of both so it is hard to decide which one to go to. Been to both and the food is consistently awesome!!!"}
{"text":"First off I would like to say that the food was excellent. I ordered the pollo con queso. It was a chimichanga filled with chicken and covered with jalapeño cream cheese then smothered in cheese. I would highly recommend it! The service was sub par. It was my first visit to Arriba's so my guest and I were very unfamiliar with the menu and the \"spice\" level. We had a lot of questions and John our server seemed annoyed with our ignorance regarding the menu. He answered our questions with vague replies such as \"it looks just like the picture\" instead of answering the question directly. Then, mid-meal we got a new server which was really confusing because who do I tip? Besides that, our food came fast and as I've said before the food was great. They are a little pricey compared to other Mexican restaurants everything is 8.99 and up and they charge a lot for sides like sour cream and other fixings. I might go back but I certainly wouldn't bring someone who hasn't been there."}
{"text":"Here's the 1. 2. 3...  1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job. 2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, they're all shitty. 3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno!   We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!  4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the low reviews. I was greeted the minute I walked in sat right away and my server came within a few minutes. everyone was very kind and attentive I had no real problems no long wait on anything. this is my first time ever going to arriba and it is an enjoyable experiment I will come again."}
{"text":"Get it together Arribas!  Service tonight sucked.hostess tried to seat us at a dirty table.. last perons take home container was left on a seat, table settings moved all around clearly had been touched but hostess said they only sat there for two minutes but have to move because of an allergy??? She copped an attitude when I requested another table...then waited more then 10 minutes before anyone came by our table...only to tell us she would be back in a few minutes... No drinks, no chips, no service...seriously... Said she was going to check on another table first...they already had food & drinks...they could have waited a few minutes...needless to say we walked out... but not before I messed up all the table settings and left a used toothpick on the table..stopped the manager on the way out and told her... Another customer walked by and confirmed ... They had terrible service tonight too... We're at another restaurant down the street now!  Get it together Arribas!"}
{"text":"Drove by and decided we hadn't been in awhile and we should eat here. I've been in the past and wasn't that impressed. Especially with the staff and the way things are run but the food has always been good. We had Jose as our server and I have to say he was awesome! We had excellent service. I requested a substitute which is usually frowned upon but he made it happen for me with no problems. He was attentive, courteous and made sure we were happy. He is definitely the reason I will be returning to this location. The food was very delicious and exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"We all know Arribas is sub-par Mexican food, but if you go in knowing this then you can't really complain, it's still reasonably tasty for a decent price. What I'm really reviewing here is this location, it has one of the best servers you could ask for, if go here ask to be seated in TJ'S section the \"diabetic Seth Rogan\" as he says, you will always have a beverage and anything else you might need, and you'll get a good laugh too."}
{"text":"I honestly CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS PLACE! I could drink their(GIANT) peach margaritas and eat their(warm and wonderful) tortilla chips every single day for the rest of my life :) Their food strays from the typical 'Mexican' fare you usually find out here, and they add their own signature touch--those smoky, spicy, sultry hatch chiles...wow.  Try the margaritas, but be prepared to drink about 12oz--they're enormous :p"}
{"text":"I just moved to Phoenix and was looking for a good drink special for lunch. If you go to Arriba at 3pm you get the overlapping lunch menu and happy hour special. 99 cent margaritas! I spent $23 and got two big lunches and four delicious margaritas. They have a nice patio with cool murals and a big waterfall. The inside is also nice with a big bar area. I had the green chile burrito and my husband had the Rio Grande enchilada. Both were good and had some spice! It's nice to see a southwestern restaurant that isn't afraid to use a little heat. I'll definitely go back. I just hope I can find someone to drive me because those margaritas are too good to pass up."}
{"text":"To be honest I was fairly disappointed with Aribas. People had given me mixed reviews prior to me going there and it seemed either people really liked it or weren't impressed at all; and upon going there myself I could see why. At first I was shocked and ecstatic by their dollar margarita special during happy hour, however when we got our drinks you could barely taste any tequila (although they were only a dollar, it literally felt like I was drinking flavored water). The chips and salsa at the table were awesome (probably the best part of eating there). I ordered enchiladas which were pretty undercooked and didn't really have much flavor outside of the melted cheese. My friends got the spicy chicken entree and a chimichanga. The spicy chicken was ridiculously spicy and not very good; the chimichanga was pretty good however but nothing special. Out waitress seemed very aloof the whole time we were there and the one thing that bothered me the most was a small side of sour cream was $1.99!!!!! despite the meals being pricey to begin with."}
{"text":"Ok well first off we walked in with a party of two , there was a huge line an the server said it was a 45 minute wait so we asked to sit at the bar witch we did an on the way noticed the  restaurant was pretty much empty an the bar was full ! The bartender was great her name was Jennifer an she made excellent drinks ! On the other hand food was way to expensive an extremely way to spicy to the point I didn't eat ! Also there was no silverware an no napkins anywhere to be found :/ not to mention all of the servers stood around an talked to one another ! We will not be going back :("}
{"text":"Poor service.  Place is going downhill. Food was cold. Wrong item came and the manager was no help. Sever was nice but incompetent."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place love their happy hour. Queso Fundido is gross tastes like rubber but everything else is great I recommend the mini chimis! The hatch chilies there are very spicy I love it! Marcelino is the best!"}
{"text":"\"Arribas: At least you won't die.\"  Bland food/ Large quantities/ Cheap prices. Go here if you plan on throwing up sometime soon, or if you are a glutton for punishment."}
{"text":"I posted a quick tip while I was there today but for some reason that doesn't show up on the Yelp website. WTF? Any how.. I kindly asked the bartender if she could put the golf on the TV today.. seeing as how we were the only people at the bar I figured this would not be an issue. It turns out all TV's in the entire restaurant are controlled by 1 DirectTV box and it was \"first come first served\" when it came to the channel that was on. She asked her fellow employees if anyone was watching the basketball game and 3 waiters responded \"yes\". It turns out it was the wait staff that was watching the game rather than catering to their customers and she said she couldn't change it. This is not the first time I have had HORRIBLE customer service at this place. It's a shame too because I like their crappy Mexican food and home brewed beer but with attitudes like that it's no wonder they have only 2 1/2 stars. How do you turn away customers and money just because the lazy ass wait staff wants to watch basketball? Never ever will go there again. P.S. Why does the logo show a chili that's farting? Might want to hire a real graphic designer like myself next time."}
{"text":"This place is just ok... There's really not much to say. Food is just ok...filling, but over all nothing special. Was not impressed with the service...We waited forever for everything even water refills. It wasn't even busy.... I do like the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. The food was just ok. The service was good though. For my family of 5 we paid $35 so the prices are about the same you would pay anywhere else. I wont go back if i have a choice. To be more spacific I felt like this food was more American Mexican style food than authentic stuff."}
{"text":"I loved how spicy everything was! Service was quick and the food was good. The never ending chops and salsa were a good start to our lunch."}
{"text":"There's Mexian food.  Then there's Mexican food.  Arribas is the best around.  Been to ALL the other places, and hands down this is the best.  Last night must have been the umpteenth time for dinner.  Had my new favorite, Green Chile Machaca Tamale.  The portion is very large and comes with two tamales.  I usually order a side of beans to go because I always have the second tamale to take home.  Plenty of chips and great salsa- hot or mild with bean dip.  They're not kidding when they tell you the hatch chiles make it hot.  Because the chiles are extremely hot - be careful if you don't like it that way.  I just have them hold the chiles or put them on the side depending on what I order.  The staff is very friendly and they remember you each time you come in.  There's hardly ever a wait because the place is so big.  If there is a wait, it's not for very long.  Did I mention great  Margaritas too!  Even their 99 cent margaritas are great, I forget what day they offer them at that price.  But if you're there when they do, don't miss out.  This place makes great Mexican food.  More importantly, their food and service is always consistent.  I've never had a bad meal here.  The building is nostalgic.  It's been there for a very long time.  It was once \"Tony Romos a place for Ribs\" and before that is was a fun place called \"Googs\".    The upscale version and night dinner spot for Guggy's Grill, which was kinda like a better Denny's or Brookshires if you remember that place.  Now I'm dating myself.  We're talking ancient history here.  This place has seen a lot of people in and out of it's doors.  I'm sure everyone in Phoenix has been there in the building one time or another.  If you have or if you haven't now you can have Mexican food there.  Go, It's great!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. If you must do a chain Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, then Arriba is your place.   Don't bother with Macayo's, Ajo Al's, etc.  Sure it's not the best, but when you want full-service and don't want the uppity Barrio Cafe type of place or the counter-service La Tolteca type of place, Arriba is good for that.  The servers are always friendly, the atmosphere inside is more gawdy than its busted bright Vegas jumbotron on its exterior sign on Camelback -- but is to be expected -- and the chip/salsa stand thing is righteous.  We were in there and out of there for dinner last Thursday in under 40 minutes (a measly 10 minute wait for our food) and under $30.  While I sometimes order the White Sands Chimichanga adorned with a creamy white cheese sauce and a mini New Mexico state flag toothpick, the Pollo al Diablo is my favorite and features a grilled chicken breast covered with fiery Hatch chile and monterey jack cheese.  It's one of their more well known dishes and is not for novices.  I am not responsible for your indigestion or hyperventilations.  Just sayin."}
{"text":"I believe I'd been to an Arriba quite awhile ago, but it has been a long time.  We went on a busy Friday night, so in that case I try to go into restaurants prepared to make many allowances as I know that crowds of people and long waits do not make for an ideal situation.   Unfortunately, even considering my reduced expectations, I can't really recommend Arriba to anyone.   The room we were seated in had a lovely rock wall with water flowing over it, however the tables and chairs were cheap, and brightly colored which contrasted with the \"zen\" feeling of the water wall.   Our server was excellent - I can't remember his name. He handled the busyness of the dining room and the various requests we had to shower on him (more silverware, clean silverware, menus, etc) cheerfully and quickly. He was well spoken and just really great.  The table was filthy - the appetizer menu and condiment holders at the end of the table had old refried beans (I assume) crusted on them, the silverware on the table was dirty - even the food presentation was sloppy and gross.   Regarding the food - it is difficult to screw up the components of Mexican food - cheese, meat, beans, tortillas/chips.  The salsa seemed like jarred store salsa, so not a great start. We ordered the Nachos Grande to share and they were okay - the chips seemed like storebought tortilla chips and the toppings were scattered haphazardly across the pile.   I ordered the Hatch Chile Relleno, which I was excited about because it was noted as very spicy with three chiles beside it on the menu. It tasted okay but really did not have much flavor and was absolutely not spicy at all. The temperature of the dish was lukewarm.  We also shared the chocolate chimichanga dessert, which was pretty good (however it's tough to go wrong with chocolate!) The portion size was good for four of us to split.   The majority of my experience wasn't terrible, but the disgusting condition of the table really marred everything else, which is too bad."}
{"text":"Say it ain't so Jose,  Major buzz kill tonight. We were hungry for some Mexican Food up in North Scottsdale and me being far removed from the city for years decided to go to Arriba since I have been a big fan since the old Andale days on Camelback Road. It wasn't but 2 or 3 years since I have dined at this Scottsdale eatery and was quite surprised that the place wasn't packed. We sat down and my daughter and I decided to order and my girlfriend was not hungry so she ordered a frosty margarita and we all started in on the chips.  The chips were not that fresh but overlooked it as no big deal. My friend's margarita was void of any alcohol and my cans of Tecate tasted old and bitter. The waitress was quite thorough explaining that my girlfriend or daughter could not order from the children's menu because they were over 12 so they split an order of mini chimichangas and I asked for my favorite the Chicken Diablo. When my order came I didn't even recognize the dish as my old favorite. The melted cheese looked as if it was melted days ago and barely covered the dark green chili below. I remember this being a very decadent cheesy gut bomb with extreme heat for cast iron stomachs like mine but the chili had no heat, barely any cheese and overly salty stone cold chicken breast seemed to have come out of a bag.  My daughter was grossed out by her chimi and offered me a taste and it was luke warm and very bland as if they had got them from the warming tray next door at Sam's Club.  Under protest from my girlfriend I asked the waitress to send our food back and just wanted to pay for our drinks and split. The manager came out and acted quite surprised by our dissatisfaction but can hardly believe she had never received a complaint before now that I see their smoking 2.5 star rating here on Yelp.  This is a real shame that one of the best corporate chains ever to come to Phoenix has shrunk to such a mediocre and unappealing experience. I guess I will need to do my Yelp research before I venture into any of my old favorites."}
{"text":"just wanted to chime in & say that this place is so vegetarian-UN-friendly it's not even funny. I was dragged here with family & ended up ordering a chile relleno, which was just about the only meatless item on the menu, short of a fucking cheese crisp.  it wasn't terrible, but this place is really just all kinds of lame. service was mediocre, food was mediocre. with as many awesome & authentic mexican restaurants as there are in the valley, there's no reason on earth to come back, except MAYBE to try a mango margarita."}
{"text":"First place I came on my first day in AZ and they served me the most disgusting Margarita- it tasted like cleaning products I told the sever the same and he looked at me like I was crazy and told me there was no way that was possible...So I chugged it and got a Corona!! The food was ok nothing special. The best part was sitting on the patio and drinking!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Very very slow and not attentive. Chips were never filled and drink refills came slowly and only when asked. Our waitress disappeared for long stretches at a time. The food was ok but not great. The rice was bland and the kids meals came about five minutes after everyone else."}
{"text":"I tried it out because I love the one on Camelback. The service was slow but the food good, not as good as the one on Camelback but far better then the Scottsdale location. I like it spicy so asked for extra hatch on the side and glad I did. I will return to give it another try. The lunch specials are a great value..."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was not very busy, which I should have taken as a bad sign.   Pros: Extensive menu, typical stuff for a Mexican restaurant   That's about it.  Cons: Service- Our waitress brought us chips, drinks and took our order. We didn't see her again after that. I had to ask the bartender for or  bill because we waited so long.   Food- I ordered 2 tacos( 1 beef, 1 chicken) with beans and rice. Food was bland, nothing really special. Salsa and bean dip were good, but chips were below average.   If you're looking for good, quality Mexican food you won't find at Arriba's."}
{"text":"I decided to have my husband's graduation party here last weekend...the service was wonderful and the food was delicious!  We come here quite a bit because it has a great atmosphere and the food has always been great."}
{"text":"We frequent this place and I just have to comment on the service by the manager the last time that I was in.   I ordered the White Sands Chimichanga (usually scrumptious) and it wasn't anywhere near the exception that it usually is. For some reason the meat was not that good. We mentioned it to the manager and she was quick to take it off the bill. We weren't expecting that or inquiring for that reason, we were specifically wondering if there was something about it that had changed, which she mentioned that they haven't changed a thing about it. She was exceptional and took it off the bill no questions asked.  The food here is always good (minus this instance) and I will continue to go back regardless of my latest experience with the food.  Besides, kids eat free on Sundays... hard to beat that!"}
{"text":"Check list: Dirty floors, sticky cheap sliver ware, sticky menus, bad server, tasteless \"Mexican\" food. Just to name a few! Guess you can make a living selling food to AllWhiteTukee that makes Taco Bell look like a five star restaurant!   Pluses: Atmosphere, chips, & ice. Only good things in this place."}
{"text":"Ok...so its your standard Mexican food with a very nice Mexican atmosphere. I like that they have pictures of all the dishes on the menu...considering I have a hard enough time with the food names. Except Taco...we all know what that is.   But here is what I like about the place over others. The service! Our server was super nice and fun and quick and attentive. I told here I was a salsa junkie and she kept me supplied...and I do like their salsa. its fresh made as are the chips. The margaritas are really really huge and very well made.   So,,,if you want an inexpensive, a-ok mexican food with exceptional service....I recommend Arriba!"}
{"text":"So Christmas \"dinner\" was kind of an afterthought this year...travelling and a time warp sort of forced that on our little merry band and we were famished by 9PM.  We went to a couple of other places first, one had an excessive wait and one was just a perfect storm of a bad idea (more on that in another review).  We ended up back at Arriba and, I must say, the reliability of a good Mexican meal (combined with a good marguerita) really helped save the day.  The staff was upbeat, even though they were working and (as always) the pricing was really reasonable.  So thanks, Arriba, for helping rescue our Christmas \"dinner\"....it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Don't order the Santa Fe chicken salad it was made with kitchen scraps.  Most Mexican restaurants take pride in the quality of their produce and presentation not this place at least not tonight."}
{"text":"Best Hatch Chile Relleno that I've had so far.  Great service -- clean -- fast -- prices are reasonable  The double chocolate chip mini chimi desert is the bomb!!!! You can share with someone it's a. If serving."}
{"text":"Very consistent, good food, service, and atmosphere. The only thing not consistent are the hatch chilies, which is understandable because they come in and out of season, but when they're hot, they're HOT! Favorites are the hatch chili especial and roswell tacos."}
{"text":"I hate it when people are like, \"I'm from Chicago so I know what a Chicago hot dog IS!!!\"  But dammit, I grew up in a AZ/NM border town and this place falls way short.  It doesn't really even seem like the food is made in a New Mexican style of preparation.  It's more like New Mexican as seen through a Sonoran filter.  I mean no disrespect to Sonoran style Mexican food, it's tasty as well.  But the green chile sauce I've had smothered over, and within, various dishes at my fave NM spots has a lot more green chile in it and is NOT merely a greenish gravy with green onions and pork (or beef).  The essence of the sauce should be green chile and not over compensated, or embellished with too many spices otherwise.    Thus, the meal I had at Arriba was lackluster.  I had huevos rancheros.  The potatoes were warm and stale as if they'd been sitting for a spell.  The refried beans could have been canned and I wouldn't have known the difference.  Even the  cheese was bland.  I've been here twice expecting to be knocked off my seat with a NM/green chile flavor explosion.  No dice, chino.  Aside from the cheesy name, if you'd like a step above this substandard NM fare, try Si Senor in Chandler.  They're pretty solid.  And if you want fire, there is always Los Dos Molinos.  Arriba, you need work."}
{"text":"We typically love this place, especially on Sundays because kids eat free! However today we walked into a nearly empty restaurant and were told we'd have to wait 10-15 minutes. Obviously they didn't have enough staff to support the number of tables but the hostess was rude and having to wait when the restaurant is empty seems ridiculous. Then our food took forever to arrive.  After about 20  minutes of waiting for our food we were about to leave when it finally arrived.  Everything was ok.  Not bad as the food here is typically pretty good.  Management needs to figure some things out.  I will say our waitress was pretty good.  She checked on us often, apologized several times and was very attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying we have been long time customers and after tonight will never return! I work in the industry and the way you keep people coming back as return customers is CUSTOMER SERVICE! When we walked in and waited to be seated....was not greeted....one cashier was busy with a customer but the other two standing there did not acknowledge us at all! Another two customers walked in and they were greeted only because one was an employee and was offered menus! Even after walking up to the cashier she still did not acknowledge us! We then turned around and left! Needles so say you lost business because some of your staff needs CUSTOMER SERVICE 101!"}
{"text":"Wow the food here is disgusting! They served me raw meat and then the manager tried to argue that it was not raw. When there is blood on the plate coming out of the mystery meat (it smelled so bad) how can u tell the customer that their wrong? The customer service and management here is terrible.   I've been to this location several times over the past several years and spent easily hundreds of dollars. I will never go back ever, and would advise anyone that cares about their health to avoid this place. I  ended up with food poisoning after eating only one small bite of the raw meat. They should reimburse me for my urgent care visit!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went yesterday (Sunday) for lunch. I love Mexican food and have been really disappointed in the other restaurants we've tried in the area since moving here in October but this one did not disappoint! Everything was absolutely delicious!! First off the margaritas were perfect. Not too sweet. Not too strong. Just right. But the food took the cake. It was hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had - period. The chips and salsa were really good. I loved that you got 3 kinds of dip/salsa with them. Then we ordered the shrimp and steak fajitas. The meat quality was excellent and they were cooked perfectly. We also ordered the white sans chimichanga. OMG! GET IT! sooooo delicious! The service was great too. Very helpful & polite waiter. We sat outside on the covered patio next to the little water fountain. Overall, a very pleasant experience with delicious food. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"A Poem.  I was feeling really lousy and  thought it was because I hadn't  eaten in over 24 hours since my stomach had yet to recover from yesterday's  disaster of a lunch. So I ate a light salad now I feel even worse. It's possible the disgusting meal I  forced down at Arriba yesterday  which left my dining companion and me with  what we thought  was severe indigestion  has actually spurred a mild  case of food poisoning"}
{"text":"We've probably come here have a dozen times or so and each time the experience is different.  The food is about the same.  Spicier than most Mexican food places we go to but there are indicators on the menu that tell you the spice level which is nice.  The service is different depending on who you get that day.  Today's service was great.  Personable lady who made sure we had extra napkins for the little one.  Even got us a non-spicy bean dip for our toddler.  I asked the first we went there if they  had non-spicy bean dip and the waitress flat out said no so I never asked after that.  This lady was nice - and courteous - that our experience was better.  Lunch time they have pretty good deals.  I would say their food is probably on the expensive end for Mexican but you can still get a meal for 2 adults and 2 child for under $40."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite Mexican food restaurants. Dinner date tonight with my hubby was amazing, as usual. Thanks for the delicious food and our apps were 1/2 off?! I'll take it!"}
{"text":"For a chain I like Arribas... only three stars because there salsa is eh... and there hot salsa not that hot.. I don't drink but my friends are always quite pleased with there Margaritas and there 99 cent special margaritas, free bean dip always makes me happy, always had good service, and my main courses have always been excellent and I have always taken home food... there specialty is hatch chilies.. and have extra spicy dishes, I would say in my opinion way better then the \"other chains\" and reasonable family prices (many locations) Always busy when i go.."}
{"text":"We made a stop here yesterday.  We took our seats at the bar and the bartender was very busy watching soccer on TV.  There were dirty dishes all over the bar.  The a/c was very cold so we moved to the other end of the bar which was much better.    I ordered a beer and my lovely wife had ice tea while we munched on chips that had good flavor.  I looked over the menu and was surprised to see most of the appetizers were priced in the $9-$12 range.    We decided to split the Chicken Quesadilla.  The bartender asked if I would like Sour Cream and Guacamole with it and I responded \"yes\": The plate came out in about 10 minutes.  The Quesadilla was one flour tortilla folded in half.  That to me is really a half of a Quesadilla not a full one.  Especially for $8.99.  The flavor was okay, nothing special.    We finished eating and asked for the bill.  That was after the bartender pulled himself away from the TV.  I took a look at it and was shocked.  We ordered one draft beer, one ice tea and one Chicken Quesadilla and the bill was $22.89!!!!!    I then realized that the adding Sour Cream and Guacamole added $1.49 and $2.49 respectively.  That is the way they make a $8.99 appetizer turn into a $12.99 appetizer.    I was not impressed with the food of the cleanliness or the service here.    We will not go back here or to the new location in Goodyear when it opens."}
{"text":"Garbage! Don't waste your time or money. Went on a week night with out 4 year old daughter and got sat right by the bar, drunks were everywhere, 2 at the bar and 2 tables near us. Staff was rude and not helpful. Spoke to the manager who was even worse, apparently our bad experience was our fault.  Food was the worst I've ever had, check took forever to come, my husband was in the service industry and I manage a retail store and I realize that people have off/bad days but this was the entire establishment. We have over the years lived off of tips and NEVER have not left a tip. Our server did not get a tip, I tried to explain the reason to the manager who could care less. Buy a frozen meal at Winco and save your sanity"}
{"text":"This establishment serves very mild Mexican food with very little flavor. The service was on the slow side. The margaritas were weak."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday mid-morning.  Seated promptly, then completely ignored from that point on.  Got up and left after 15 minutes.  The hostess gave us a blank stare as we walked out, and told her no one would wait on us.  The staff did not seem to care at all.  This is not the type of attitude and service you want from a place that prepares your food - Danger, stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a happy hour and it was Meh, OK but not great.  Service was odd, was not told about all the specials.  The food was just OK and I\"m happy I only paid 1/2 price during happy hour.  There are better places for Happy Hour in the area."}
{"text":"I came in on my birthday on Aug. 16 and I let them know and even the waitress and I felt like they didn't care the margarita did not taste to great as well the food no the checking in on me  no I just wanted to go and I was so sad on my birthday( but hey I went to 7th Ave / Osborn  to (Mi Patio) great happy hour Million stars for them Go MI PATIO  )"}
{"text":"I need to preface this review by stating I am from Southern California and I am used to a very specific type of Mexican food. Namely, GREAT Mexican food.  I came here recently with colleagues and we were a large party. The staff took very good care of us considering it was such a big group and I definitely give them kudos for that.  The food was definitely not was I was hoping for. The bacon wrapped shrimpo were pretytyy good, but my chicken was smothered in salsa con queso that could have been Tostitos out of a jar. It did little to offset the dry chicken breast I was served. My side of black beans was ok, the rice was ok, but overall I left hungry."}
{"text":"We didn't eat an entree here so I can't comment on that aspect.  We had their house margarita for two (but it wasn't 99c happy hour time) and enjoyed it, great value for 8 dollars.  One of our party had the Ultimate Margarita and he rated it 4 stars out of 5.  We ordered some guac dip to go with the chips and salsa (spicy but good spicy) and left satisfied.  The server we had was great, and gave us top notch service even though we were only having a drink and chips, although I did notice other servers weren't as attentive to their tables."}
{"text":"love the happy hour and the 99 cent tacos, my girlfriend could not finish her margarita it was so good she wished she could have taken it home.  One complaint some of the booth seats need more padding can feel the springs."}
{"text":"The food was great, once we FINALLY got service!!! I had to go to the front desk and ask for a server, then another in our party went to the front desk to ask for a server. When we finally did get to order, it took at least a half hour before our food came."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  The service was bush league.   Check was over charged with extra items not ordered.  Waiters were polite to help fix the issues.   Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is delicious! $2 margs can't be beat! Service was fast and attentive!"}
{"text":"Can't believe they only get 2 1/2 stars! Arriba Mexican Grill is hands down our favorite Mexican restaurant. We've been coming here for years. Fast friendly service and spicy delicious food. The salsa is fresh, and bean dip is savory. I've never ordered anything I don't like. We love the adobada Rio Grande enchiladas, white sands chimichanga, and the poblano chile relleno."}
{"text":"Should be called \"New Mexican Food\" rather than Mexican food. The option were limited. Not quite the traditional Mexican food I was hoping for. Very Americanized. Too salty.   I only saw white people staffing the restaurant. Not a Spanish speaker in sight. So if you're looking for authentic, keep cruising; this isn't your place. If you're looking for a decent atmosphere and you aren't terribly concerned about the food; this will do just fine."}
{"text":"When I first started going to Arriba years ago, they were truly a New Mexican oriented restaurant.  I don't know if they changed owners, but now they are more focused on being a microbrewery and less on Hatch/Santa Fe style foods.  Their guacamole is still a very good buy - great with some of their freshly made flour tortillas to make guacamole burritos.  Most of their other food is too salty and too cheesy for my taste.  I like minimalist Mexican food so I can taste the rich sauces and fresh corn tortillas - I think Arriba lacks this freshness.  Chips and salsa are very good."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  First, a worker was folding napkins on the host stand as we all waited to be seated on a busy Saturday night (not a huge deal) but then I saw him seat a family and he kept running his hands through his medium length hair and then go right back to folding silverware in napkins.  He went on to do this again with the next group he sat.  Second, the men's restroom was filthy.  The latrine was covered in dirt, grime, and who knows what all along the outer fixtures...my mother-in-law later confirmed the ladies' room was gross too.  Third, our server is in desperate need of training on basics.  First he forgot we asked for water.  Then, I asked him about a certain drink -- he had no input (no biggie).  So I ordered the small margarita, he brought out the big one.  I mentioned it when it came out but he said it only came in the size for \"two\"...I asked why the menu had two prices on it then.  He said he didn't know, so he insisted on taking away the drink and brought me the smaller one -- interesting (most places just charge you for what you ordered so they don't waste more booze from a re-pour).  Anyway, when the drink came, he apologized for the wait but said they were training someone new in the bar and my wife's skinny margarita was a great \"training opportunity.\"  Huh??  My drink ended up being beyond disgusting after one sip (I felt bad since I had already had a problem with the first).  I called him over, apologized but said I couldn't drink it because it was undrinkable.   He replied that was fine he'd take it, but I was going to have to pay for it because it was served.  I told him that was weird and that had never happened to me before -- if it's bad you get another one ya know.  He then went on to opine about Arizona law and how neither he NOR his manager could remove that drink from my bill...  Keep in mind I had one sip.  I said whatever and got a something else.  About this time, my mother in law joined our party and she also ordered a drink.  Unfortunately, the prices for the house margarita had literally been scratched out with pen ink on the menu  (SERIOUSLY). So, she asked him how much they were.  He didn't know for sure but proceeded to stand there dumbfounded instead of going to check on prices...just staring at her uncomfortably.  She finally chose her drink.  The food was pretty much what one would expect from a southwest Mexican chain -- pretty decent, not great but no real complaints here.  Of course, the waiter brought the check while we were in the middle of our entrees but oh well.  When he came over to check on us and clear plates, he kept referring to my mother-in-law (an attractive lady in her early 60s) as \"darling\" and me as both \"boss\" and \"hoss.\"  She mentioned that she thought that was a little inappropriate but again -- not a huge deal.  I actually asked him what he was calling me and he nervously said something about him being from the midwest...(who knows)??  The evening finally came to an end when a friendly manager came over to our table to ask how everything had been -- she was making rounds to all the tables that evening it seemed.  My wife let her know about the drink issue and she very politely took the charge off our bill -- which I'm sure must have floored our AZ law expert.  The manager was quite apologetic about the whole incident.  The table didn't fill her in on all the aforementioned because honestly we were just ready to pay and get out of there.  This manager was the only bright spot of the evening really and the only reason this dump gets 1 instead of 0 stars.  Bottom line, never going back."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to come in here at 3 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon as the parking lot was empty and the building looked a little run down. But it is the best authentic Mexican food I've had in a long time. We were started with salsa and bean dip which was quickly refilled and we devoured it. The Mexican rice was to die for. Peppery and spicy. I Could have eaten just that. There was a lot of rave about the margaritas, but I was disappointed. Way to syrupy and tasted mostly of mix. The server was quick and attentive.  He offered us to go waters and chips and salsa which was a nice suprise. Reasonably price, fast service,  and definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"Well wear do I start, we were seated right away but seems like they forgot about us in this empty Mexican restaurant. When we flagged someone down they they didn't know who our server was they searched and did find her. So we got second worst who was rude and pretty much managed to piss me off. Food was mediocre my fault considering my place of business had catering from this place and was pretty good. Forget coming in, just horrible service and food. Won't come here again certainly won't bother with catering either"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food and service in Goodyear. Pollo can queso, white sands and enchiladas are the best.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We love this spot for happy hour and normally have the best service and great prices... This time Kevin was our server and he was the worst. He complained loudly about our requests for drinks or food, our request to split the check and then added gratuity. The drinks are also apparently a different price if you do not sit in the bar area?? This was never the case before but today it was. I will second guess going back there again and if we do decide to have another happy hour there we will definitely request a different server!! Bummed"}
{"text":"We went to Arribas for Christmas dinner.  There was a 30min wait even though the place was about 40% empty.  People that were waiting started seating themselves at open booths in the bar even they it wasn't open seating.  When one person complained about it they were immediately seated at another open booth.  Being the chump that I am and having a party of 6 we waiting patiently.  I ran over to CVS to get a snack for the wait.  We were finally seated new an area that was closed off and near several empty and set tables while others waiting to be seated.  Our server only had 2-3 tables but was gone from the floor for long stretches.  It took over 10 min to get our drinks (probably more like 15).    The food took at least 45min (although the guacamole came out fairly quickly).  I had the chicken breast plate.  The chicken was nicely seasons, the rice was ok, the bean portion was very small.  My wife's fajitas were good but the veggies were incinerated.  the kids enjoyed their tacos, salsa, bean dip and guac.  I tried a couple of the house beers but they didn't impress me.  My wife had a 99c margarita and liked it.    While my wife was using the bathroom a waitress came in crying.  I can only guess that the kitchen was understaffed so they held people back to keep from flooding it.  The food was decent and there are other things on the menu I would like to try, so we may be back again, but not at Christmas."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials.  Food was good and priced on par for what you get.  Our server was great (gal with long black hair and glasses).  The bean dip with the chips was grest touch.  Kids meals were sufficient and priced right."}
{"text":"Not a good visit at all today. I've never had complaints about the food but the service is always slow and horrible. Tonight while waiting we watched an employee touch all kinds of stuff around the counter and and then wrap silverware without washing her hands.  We were seated in the far back corner where there were four empty booths, two of which had dirty dishes piled up to watch while we waited. The table we sat at was barley wiped down. Very dirty tables throughout the place. After about ten minutes of not getting any service we left.   Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service here sucks our waiter Martin who goes by Jesus was not welcoming. He made my brother and I feel like we were a hassle and he made faces when I asked him questions about the menu. As if I annoyed him it was unfortunate that my first experience had to be with such a waiter.  However besides bad service the food, chips and salsa with bean dip is awesome. Get new staff who actually want a good tip he didn't deserve any tip that I left him but since I work in that line of business I left it. Next time I won't and yes I will be back and making sure I request a server who's name isn't Martin/Jesus."}
{"text":"Food is great!  Service: so-so.  Last time I was there, we sat outside.  The tables were very dirty and gross.  The tables are wooden slats, so the food drops between them and I am sure hard to clean.  Mabe the manager should look into getting different tables.  Other than that, we do enjoy it there.  Been a customer since they opened."}
{"text":"Why, hello, 99 cent margaritas.    I used to go here with a friend when I lived in the Biltmore area a year or so ago, and I lived and breathed off the shrimp and scallops del mar.  Nowadays, another friend and I like to frequent Arriba for their happy hour margaritas.  The chips and salsa are excellent, and although the servers speak hardly a lick of English, service is generally pretty good.  The food leaves something to be desired, excepting the shrimp and scallops del mar, as well as the chips and dip, but the drinks and service are awesome.  It's just the right place to drop by after a crappy day at work."}
{"text":"I see a lot of great reviews for this restaurant although our server was attentive the food was not great....we ordered the queso fundido and got back hot melted nacho cheese  my husband ordered the tacos and they were cold....not a place we will visit again"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Arribas for quite some time and for only 2 reasons: 1) the complimentary bean dip served with chips is excellent; 2) their chicken tortilla soup is delicious.  I'm disappointed every time I deviate.  Today there was a cockroach crawling on the wall at my table.  I desperately tried not to freak out and keep my irrational phobia at bay. (I'd rather fight in a barroom brawl than deal with bugs) I digress. It disappeared into a crevice and I thought \"ok.  I can live with that\". (the soup is THAT good)....until it surfaced again and refused to retreat.  I had to call the hostess over and show her the bug dancing all over the wall.  She called the manager.  The manager came over and kept asking me where the bug was....I kept pointing to where it disappeared to...he kept saying he didn't see it, which I don't give a shit if HE couldn't see it...I saw it.  My lunchmate saw it and the hostess saw it.  He also brought with him an Ecolab exterminator report that indicated they were just there and that he was aware of the problem and that he's been trying to get rid of them.  I don't know why he felt he had to do that.  At any rate, he was anything but apologetic.  The whole while, our server kept walking by our table and visibly scowling at us as if WE brought the roach for a discount.  The situation was handled poorly.  He could've just said \"sorry, we are working on this.  Let me take care of the bill.\"  Seriously, we only had soup.  A mere $15 total.  For this reason - I won't go back again."}
{"text":"Yeah um this place rocks. Cool bar area. The bomb"}
{"text":"Reluctantly went here due to the lack of options around this area.  It was GOD AWFUL.  First they made us wait for 15 minutes at the front while 2/3rds of the place was empty.  Then they stick us in a corner with a waiter named Josh who forgot about us over and over again for 15 minutes at a time.  Ran out of stale chips.  No refills.  Not even a plate or utensils for my son.    Every single thing about this place sucked.  The food was covered in cheese and horrible.  We waited forever and ever and ever.  Finally we were allowed to pay our bill and leave.  He brought us a to go box that we left with more than half the disgusting food.  How in hell is this place open is the question of the year.  Never again.  I wouldn't return here if you paid me."}
{"text":"Wifey and I have been dining here for 4 years now, and we really like it. Its too spicy for some, and we have tried nearly everything on their menu, with only one or two disappointments. Price is right, the salsa and chips are great, decor is funky and colorful, service is just OK sometimes. Best stuff on the menu- White sands Chimichanga is great! The Fundido cheese appetizer is fantastic as well. Chili Colorado is spicy and one of my favorites, as well as the Grande Nachos. Breakfast on weekends only is a killer bargain, and the New Mexican eggs benedict is a winner! Very, very cheap as well. I am not sure why this place has received such mediocre reviews, as its not generic & boring Mexican food such as Macayo's, Garduno's, Manuel's, or Garcias!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cheap eat, go here during happy hour. It's from 3 to 7 Monday thru Friday.  All the appetizers except for the Mexican pizza and something else that I can't tell remember are half of. We ordered the hatch green Chile cheese crisp,  mini macaca chimes and guacamole plus two house margaritas and out bill was under $20. Our waitress was very attentive always filling up our water and chips.  Definitely the best time to grab some grub."}
{"text":"Probably been here over a hundred times. I think I've had maybe one kinda bad experience. Every other time the food is consistently great (we love the Rio Grande Enchiladas and White Sands Chimichangas). The bean dip is about the best in the valley that we've seen.  Waiters and waitresses are always great. We're not seafood eaters so can't speak to that, but every else we've had and loved. It's one of our regular places, one of the places we always take our parents and friends when they come into town, and we'll continue to go for as long as we live here."}
{"text":"Good margaritas and apps for happy hour. Not a very big bar but the bartender is very friendly.  I've been many times."}
{"text":"Alright, I've been to Arribas before and it was always just \"okay\". However, this was the worst experience I have had before at any restaurant.   I had a QT drink that I brought into the restaurant, not even thinking. Our server was getting off and we would have a new server. As I was in the restroom, I was informed by my friends that the new server tried reaching for my drink really awkwardly and they had no idea what was happening. They told him I was in the RR and would be back shortly. Right when I come out I'm getting bombarded by him telling me I can't have any outside food or drink. He was very flustered and you could tell he didn't really know how to handle the situation. I told him that it wasn't a big deal, handed over the drink and proceeded to sit down.   Now, this wasn't the big deal. I felt that this situation was handled in the worst possible way. If this was such a big deal, the manager (who had greeted us and directed us where to sit) should have told me that I could not have the drink. By placing the responsibility and urgency on the server, he in turn got very flustered. I felt bad for the server.  We did not order any food and my friend paid for her drink. On our way out I talked to the manager.  This was the most unprofessional manager ever. He denied seeing us walk into the store. Would not listen to what I had to say, and turned the story so that it was the servers fault. This manager wouldn't even listen to me or my friends when we explained the situation! Very very horrible customer service.   Needless to say, I will never be returning and I will not refer anyone here.  P.S. The menu has so many pictures nothing stands out. Everything looked the same and it was a very difficult menu to \"read\"."}
{"text":"Had lunch and was pleased with the quality of the food, the portion size, the service, and the physical layout of the restaurant. We were promptly seated and the waitress was very quick to the table with the salsa and bean dip.  This was a plus in that you don't often get bean dip with the traditional salsa. They were both spicy enough to get the tongue tingle and it was nice that both my wife and I received our own bowls and did not have to share. They have an extensive menu and had two of my favorites which are chili Colorado and adobada.  I ordered the adobada plate and for $8 it was very good and plentiful. I had the black beans which were also very good. The rice was average but I like to pile some salsa on it so it worked out fine.  My wife had the layered chicken New Mexico enchilada with green sauce which was pretty dang spicy, lots of hatch chile's(also at $8)!  The waitress was friendly and efficient and we will certainly return."}
{"text":"Food always has very good flavor and the portions are huge. You also get chips and salsa/beans right when you sit down which is a nice tasty treat. If you like spicy this place is for you! The margaritas are ginormous and have good flavor. The last time I came here I brought my mom and girlfriend, on a Sunday afternoon, we got our food but had to ask for utensils and the re-fills were scarce. It was a busy day but those 2 things are simple things restaurants should have down."}
{"text":"Taco salad had so much ranch dressing that is tasted like I was just drinking straight out of a bottle of ranch.  Also some of the lettuce was soggy and brown.  My wife's plate was good...taco and enchilada, hance the 3 star  I think this place would normally be good but this time was not so bueno ....."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!! The staff are really friendly and professional. Anything you order is going to be good!  Their White Sands chimichanga is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"While dining there, roaches were crawling around our table. I told the waiter and he shrugged & said sorry, but did nothing about it. I will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"My family and I went here last night for dinner and instantly regretted it. Our server's name was Jose, and he barely could be bothered to take our orders. And it wasn't just our table; he had about 4 tables out on the patio and ignored all of them. We asked for extra salsa and never got it. He never brought us silverware. It got so bad that eventually the manager came out and was working his tables. I walked inside to see if it was super busy to explain his absence, but over half the restaurant was empty. When the food runners came out with our food (which took a while, but by that point, I wasn't surprised), one of them asked the other, \"Do you know the seat numbers?\" (referring to which plates belonged to which seats), and he replied loudly, \"No, the ticket said 206, and this isn't even table 206!\"  Furthermore, my mother and I both ordered margaritas. We might as well had ordered juice. They were so weak, I'm not sure there was any alcohol at all in them. I have worked in bars for years, so I know my drinks, and these were the weakest I've had in Gilbert yet.  As for the food, it was just mediocre. The best part was the salsa, of which we were never able to get extra.  Overall, this place was a hot mess, and I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp tonite and decided to give Arriba's a whirl.  We went to the Camelback location.  The place was OK.  Nothing stupendous and nothing God awful either.  The whole place looked pretty grungy, in particular there was trash all over the floors; bits of paper, wrappers, gum and such.   The service was \"meh\".  After we were seated a highly disinterested bus person or food runner dropped off a heaping wrought iron edifice of greasy, pretty tasteless chips.  They actually tasted more like cereal than tortilla chips. She also sloughed off extra ramekins of bland, but spicy bean dip and salsa.  She kinda dropped the stuff on the table and withdrew quickly as if she were throwing a diaper into the trash.  Our server barely spoke English and barely seemed to notice we were there.  She seemed either aloof or afraid to speak, which I guess was her personal rendition of subservience or something.  The BF and I both wanted to try the White Sands Chimi after all the awesome reviews on Yelp, so we agreed that he'd get it, give me a bite and I ordered the Arriba sampler, which was like 8 appetizer sized chucks of really greazy, indistinguishable and pretty tasteless finger foods.  He ordered guacamole with his and I asked for sour creme with mine.  His guacamole did not come out on his plate or on the side, but we were charged $2.50 for it.  I did get \"sour creme\" but it was more of a frozen glop of dairy than anything else.  The White Sands Chimi seemed like it would have a good flavor but I couldn't really savor it because the intense burning was too much to endure. The BF & I literally swapped plates halfway thru the meal b/c he couldn't take the heat of the chilies anymore.  I really don't think they're hatch chilies. They burned like jalapeño.  I buy roasted hatch chilies fresh-roasted at Food City all the time and they do not burn the crap outta your tongue like this food did.  Our server never came back to check on the food, our drinks, bring more water or soda and I literally had to flag her down to ask for the check.  It was NOT busy in there at all and I saw about 5 other servers buzzing about serving the maybe 10 tables total that were seated in the whole place.  All in all -- nothing overwhelming, including the food. It just all tasted like overly greazy fried corn chips that had been in a half empty cereal box for 6 months.  Other than \"spicy\" -- there were no particularly memorable or enjoyable flavors.  I don't think that just burning my (I suppose wuss-assed, from other people's reviews) tongue on bland fried foods is authentic Mexican.  There were some people hootin' it up in the bar. I guess if you like Big Gulp-sized margaritas, this place might be cool. Doubt I'll return.  The BF liked it though, so who knows. Maybe it was just an off night for me.  The desserts did look amazing so maybe some other time we'll check it out for sweets."}
{"text":"WARNING! PLEASE READ!  I was so astonished by how bad the service was here, not to mention the RISK that I made a yelp account just to warn others. Coming from a native New Mexican, I will echo what so many people here giving the one star reviews have said (and if you read on you'll see why), the service...   I came here for mine and my girlfriend's one year anniversary. It was suppose to be a special day. We are both originally from New Mexico so the idea of being able to order the food we grew up on sounded great. We were very excited to go here, but that was very short lived... As I walked up there were two girls and one very young boy at the front counter. I saw they had a very nice patio and asked if we could sit out there. They said that it might be a problem, that a party would be coming and when they got there we would be asked to \"leave.\" I found her choice of words very odd and the other girl tried to explain we would have to relocate. I looked at my girlfriend, already with a bad feeling about the place and asked if she wanted to stay, which she did.   Now this is when things get important, remember this: I said \"I guess we'll eat inside.\" and the girl replied \"Okay, I'll seat you in the bar then.\" I looked at her crooked and said \"Um, no...? Is there a table in the dining room? We don't drink or smoke...\" I looked around and the dining room had plenty of tables, not even half full. The girl sighed and grabbed some menus with haste, then took us to the very back, in a gloomy little corner and tossed them down on the table. I was amazed and almost walked out but my girlfriend was still excited some how.  I will say, our waiter was very friendly but he was a terrible waiter. It took him well over 10 minutes after my drink ran and me having to actually get up (flagging him down didn't work) and ask him for a refill. About 5 minutes after that, I finally got one, the thing is... There was something INCREDIBLY strange tasting about my drink. It was non alcoholic, a simple glass of water that tasted like swamp water. I gagged and spit it out. The smell of it was FOUL.   To add on, the food was VERY mediocre for being in the $10-$15 a plate range. It was very bland and the spices weren't done quite right in my opinion. Again, coming from some one who grew up in New Mexico.   The entire time, the manager kept giving us these odd looks, staring us down and making us feel uncomfortable. I thought it was all over, but it wasn't...  I had a family member pass through Phoenix and decide to eat here, they told me their story a bit too late however, I should have checked with them first knowing they've been through here. He told me that when he went here on a trip, they insisted on sitting him at the bar because he was alone and were very rude about it. They would not sit him at a table, even though he didn't want alcohol, only food.  The place is very poorly managed and that makes me very sad. I wish my great home state was better represented here in the Valley of the Sun.   PLEASE BE WARNED, before eating here. You will be treated terribly and who knows what they might do to your food (or drink) if they don't like you."}
{"text":"I went once and was very unimpressed.  Since I live in walking distance I decided to go back and just get a quesadilla and a beer.  Who could mess that up right?  I had to laugh when my corona tasted skunky and quesadilla was so bad I only had one slice.  You need to have very very low standards to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"My family has ate here several times through the years.  Never GREAT service but good enough.  But this last weekend has left us all saying NO to Arribas.  Friday Night while my mother was hosting several ladies at the house my Dad decided to go out to Arribas for dinner.  He was greeted & was given his drink along with chips and salsa.  He later received his food & asked for 2 salsas for his dinner.  When waiting for a very ling time... long enough for his food to get ice cold, he decided to leave.  Once he was getting up to leave he was asked if he would like his food to go??? TO GO???? UMMM..NO!!    SO Saturday my mother and I while out for a day of wedding plans & shopping decided to stop at Arribas for a bite.  Giving last night a pass with caution.  We arrived & they were on a wait which we gladly waited.  After about 15 mi n we were seated in the bar area.  Not our first pick but it was busy so we understood.  We took our seats in our booth & then waited & waited... a young man passing by said to the bartender do you have table #... the bartender looked up at us and said ya I got it.  I knew then we would be a little less cared for since the bar was full as well as the restaurant.  We were brought chips and salsa & even a request for the hotter stuff was accommodated by the same yiung man.  This occured all prior to bring us our drinks by the bartender. ice tea & a water... We put our order in straight away when the drinks finally arrived.  The food was good but no one ever came back we needed a few extra napkins & a small plate.  The manager passing that we waived down was kind enough to get this for us.  After sitting for some time with our dirty dishes at our table & empty drinks we were brought a bill.  The bill included a 1.60 change for a side of jalapeno cream cheese.  This came with the meal.  Asked for the manager she/he never came we ended up patio g the bill & leaving with a bad taste for this experience.  Arribas  is no longer on our family rotaion."}
{"text":"The 99 cent happy Hour margarita is what we thought it was, a flavorless beverage that tastes like a snow cone minus any flavor. They do give free chips and bean dip and salsa, nothing special in that world either. Also, how can you build a restaurant in Arizona and forget to put in an outside patio. Get ride of that dumb fountain and have some outside seating."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here.  Despite sixteen open tables there was a twenty minute wait.  When I asked the manager about this he was very rude so we left.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Love the lunch specials.  The food and service is average.  I don't get all the menu's though.  We went for lunch the other day and we were each given 5 different menus with different items on them-to only find out that we actually had a few were different.  It was confusing and a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is a nice Mexican chain restaurant with very tasty food for both breakfast and dinner.  The breakfasts are very reasonably priced.  They start you off with delicious salsa, bean dip and fresh tortilla chips.  There are two dozen meals to choose from including breakfast burrito, Mexican skillet, sweet potato pancakes with pork carnitas, huevos ranchero stacker, and more traditional pancake, bacon and egg deals.  Everything we had was delicious, tasty and accurately described on the menu.  For dinner, white sands chimichanga, Mexican pizza, steak, chili relleno, tortilla soup, all passed the taste test.  It's reasonably priced, has a nice atmosphere and knowledgable servers."}
{"text":"ARRIBA, ARRIBA!!!  I could of mistaken myself for being on the other side of the border.  Right when you sit down they great you with fresh tortilla chips and hot and mild salsa, and bean dip.  My dad, and little brother enjoy that taste of the creamy, spicy, triple \"pepper\" rated, Steak Tapico;  a tenderloin steak smothered with Hatch chile and queso fundido and served with a cheese enchilada and  rice. They both hate guacamole and black beans so they ordered double rice, and the waiter delivered exactly what they ordered. Based on how hot the food is, they rate each of their foods with peppers, on the menu.  My mother and i, ordered something with little less of a kick, and loved the Chimichanga Plate; a huge flour tortilla, with your choice of beef, ground beef, chicken, and either red or green chile. The sour cream was just the thing to top it all off. With the rice and beans on the side, it was enough to leave the place content.  The staff were dressed in traditional mexican, festive outfits, that make it a fun, exciting evening for the family, no matter what ages.   The prices range from pretty cheap to moderate, but without the need of an appetizer, it leaves you with your pockets still heavy.  We got there around 7, and it was packed, but we got in within a 10-15 minute wait, and the staff were pretty friendly. The food could of made up for it.  It was a pretty clean, comfortable place, and ill be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"The spiciness is just right. Portions are large enough to share. Suhail our waiter was incredible."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for years and was craving fajitas.......Not what I remembered...The steak for the fajitas was overcooked and very tough. Looked like a few pepper slices mixed with a whole onion. My wife got the chicken chili relleno. It came drenched in cheese that was actually soupy at the bottom. We found a tiny amount of chicken after scraping away all the excess cheese. I give it 2 stars.....1 for the service and 1 because I ate it."}
{"text":"At first I was upset because they didn't have vegetable burritos on the menu but the waiter decided to make one for me anyway and put everything I asked for in it. He kept it at the same price as the other burritos too! Which was like 10 or 11 bucks. I really appreciated that he did that. The vegetable burrito is huge and really good! They put enchilada vegetables, sour cream, guacamole, onions, jalapenos, beans and cheese with rice on the side. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! Arriba Mexican Grill is the new mexican spot for me! Ask for Jonathan. He is a great server! He is the reason for the 5 stars! You guys need to give that guy a promotion or something. Great service!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here. There is a senor taco that is less expensive and way better. The food here is so salty and gross. I don't know why we thought it would be a good idea to come here. The rice was good and the service was ok."}
{"text":"Was craving flan so ordered one to go...it was good but for almost $6 it was tiny! If you're gonna charge that much than at least give out bigger portion..."}
{"text":"As I walked in tortilla chips and salsa were served to my friends and I. It was great,  I had the Santa Fe Fajita Salad it was delicious, I just wish my plate had more chicken it lack on that portion.  It was my first time at Arriba Mexican grill, nothing to different from what I eat at home, but I don't mind eating out and having a good time with friends."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  Stopped for lunch on a tip from a fellow passenger on my flight in from ABQ.  Ordered chili relleno stuffed with ground beef and a green corn tamale.  AWESOME!  Great service.  The manager stopped by and sat down to visit at my invitation.  Genuinely cared to take time to listen to my feedback!  Tough to compete in PHX restaurant atmosphere and Arribas is doubtful to ever disappoint you."}
{"text":"I just wanted to take the time to state how wonderful our experience was dining at  Arriba's. This location is lotcated at 2855 S. Market St. Gilbert Az, 85295. Our waiter, Jose Facio, was kind, knowledgeable, and efficient. He knew the menu and offered a few meals that catered to our likes. He also checked often to see if we needed refills or any other sides throughout our meal. He was not overbearing or neglectful. He made our dining out memorable. So thank you Jose. Your company is fortunate to have an employee who represents great service and encourages first time customers to become regular customers."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this restaurant deserves the ratings that it had.  Service was spotty and the food was so-so.  Pre-meal chips were mostly stale.  Our waitress seemed frazzled and when I asked for a drink menu, she said they didn't have one because they were revamping it.  She seemed annoyed to have to explain the different kinds of margaritas available.    Dissapointing all the way around."}
{"text":"So, I'm totally sure what the differene between New Mexican and just Mexican food is, but this place is New Mexican.  this location is pretty nice, with an huge shded patio area that has a rocking water feature that creates this spray-mist to cool off the area - granted, it's not so great when it's 110 out with 75 percent humidity, but it looks nice nontheless.  kind of family joint, on a par with Macayo's."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  I love that they serve spicy bean dip with their chips and you don't pay extra for it.  I get the same thing every time I go, the White Sands Chimichanga.  It's spicy and tasty."}
{"text":"Our go to place for New Mexico style Mexican dishes.  Love the salsa and the variety.  Lots of spicy dishes as well as the standards.  We started our New Year's Eve here.  The regular Margaritas are crazy big."}
{"text":"I don't give too many 2 star reviews. Mainly because I know this stuff effects people's lives and livelihood and also, having run a food service establishment, i realize we could have come on an off night, but other than the fact that everyone had a great attitude our evening at Arriba was sub-par.  They sat us in a closing section so we had to move seats after a couple minutes of getting settled. Once in our new seats, we waited...and waited for our server. Unfortunately I didn't time it to give a subjective view, but I was trying not to influence my wife's opinion. Once the order was taken it took way too long for my Margarita, which was horrible. The food was OK, but service (saying hello, getting drinks, refills, checking up on us) is the easiest piece and they failed.   Honestly if we had looked at the rating on yelp first we wouldn't have ventured in in the first place, but here's to new experiences. Best of luck Arriba, we will not be back."}
{"text":"The ambiance and location are OK. The chips and salsa were fantastic. The service was OK. The fajitas I ordered were OK, not bad, not anything to Yelp about. This restaurant would be good if you wanted some Mexican food a few clicks above Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We came here from Texas to enjoy some delicious green chili enchiladas and awesome margaritas BUT DON'T walk in here at 9pm or afterward on a Friday cuz at 10pm they cut the music off kill the wonderful ambience of having a nice time and get the hell out!"}
{"text":"Came here today for the Easter Brunch. I ordered off the menu and my boyfriend got the brunch. Neither of us were impressed by the food.  Very processed and salty.  Nothing seemed to stand out.  As a matter of fact, the food was nauseating and I actually had to excuse myself to the restroom 15 minutes after eating only to find myself hovering over the porcelain basin  (sorry for the description) This is my second unsuccessful visit here.  I will not return."}
{"text":"I dont get the reviews, I love this place. I get the \"White Sands Chimi\" and its fantastic. Its just the right amount of heat with a great flavor. The food is always very good and I have been going there for years. Try anything with the hatch chilis, thats where the flavor comes from."}
{"text":"I'm a nacho addict and the ones here are greasy, orgasmic deliciousness. They pile on the toppings, mmmm so good!! I rarely come here because it's a heart attack on a plate but it is GOOD. Oh, and combine it with the Happy Hour 99 cent margaritas. ... Can't really get a better deal anywhere else. The service here is okay ... Not the friendliest service, but whatever ... The good food and prices is where it's at."}
{"text":"Well what can I say.   The food is fair.. I do have a major issue with the service.  There is no excuse for waiters that decide to memorize the order and not write it down.   Of course, the order was messed up.... no appetizer!  No tip!      I did discuss it with the manager upon leaving and he did insure me that it is not store policy and they're suppose to write out.    The manager was nice about it."}
{"text":"My husband was excited about this place because all the dishes were named after places in New Mexico. I was not as enthused, but I joined him for dinner anyway. The atmosphere is great!  We sat out on the patio, it was nice. There is a water feature that made us feel relaxed.   The menu had many items on it. All of the chile dishes revolved around Hatch green chile. Being a red chile fan I was not impressed, but dh likes green so he could not decide what to order. Chips and salsa come with 3 different salsas, a mild, a hot, and a spicy bean dip. We are from New Mexico where salsa is done to our liking, with that being said I will continue on the salsas. The mild we did not even try. Looked like it had a lot of tomatoes. The hot we tried. I don't get it, why are the salsas sweet? Did not like. We finally tried the bean dip, which usually I am not a fan. This one actually had the spice going on and was not sweet! Woo hoo! We have a winner! The chips are really good. Made in house. These are light and thin, but not too thin they break in the bean dip. They are just perfect!   Food selection like I said was HUGE. When in doubt I stick to burgers. In this case I chose the green chile burger. I did not read the description on the menu just knew that I could not go wrong with a burger. Dh ordered beef adobaba. When my burger was served it had green chile in a queso sauce, and it was delicious. The Hatch green chile was tasty and not hot (remember we are from New Mexico). The queso sauce had green chile in it and made the burger a little messy to eat, but I did not complain. The burger also came with 2 patties. I saved one for my lunch the next day because it would have been too much for me, but if you like that then this will be your go to burger. Dh's beef was good. He liked the beans and even the rice which he is usually not a fan of the rice.  I thought it could have been spicier, but I really like HOT RED CHILE. We split a sopapilla which are served as a dessert here. At home they could be used either way, and I usually ate it with my food. The sopa was good.  This place, which is why dh was there, makes their own beer! Now they don't have an IPA, but what they did have was good. Dh ordered the Bock. He normally doesn't order Bock but since they didn't have IPA, it was the next go to. He liked this one. He was amazed at the brewing. He now says he may try out their amber since the bock had good flavor.  Our waitress was very attentive. I never had to ask for a refill of water. It was not busy when we showed up or as we ate. The only negative thing was because we were eating outside a person sitting at the outside bar was smoking. Luckily it was when we were ready to  call it a night anyway, but wow that was stinky!   We may be back again and I will post if I choose something different next time."}
{"text":"I will start off telling you I'm a chef, so I expect good food, and I know when food is prepared properly. I am very critical of freshness. I'm used to cooking at home with freshly prepared everything so when I go out, I want something better than I could have made myself. This fell short in many ways. For example, the fresh tomato salsa served with my fajitas was spent. The flavors were all muted and the tomatoes had been chopped at least a day ago, possibly more. You could see they were dark, and breaking down into mush. The fajita meat had a good grilled flavor, but dry and overcooked. I ordered them with chiles for an extra dollar expecting to have them on the sizzling plate with my fajita meat, especially since they advertise their fresh roasted Hatch chiles on site, but instead they were brought a few minutes later after my meal was served, in a separate dish, cold, mushy, looking like they just came out of a can. I asked for fresh lime to squeeze over my meat and overcooked onions, and got brown dry, lime wheels served on the side of my margarita glass instead. And the margaritas! Okay the first one was .99 cents so I'm not going to complain. But the next one was a very large overpriced one that just tasted like watered down cheap margarita mix. My rice was precooked, dry and old, and way too salty. My husband's chimichanga was basically a big burrito covered in some massive amount of sauce, but it was not deep fried as I thought a chimichanga is supposed to be. Or if it was, it wasn't cooked enough because it was mushy. My kids cheese crisp was... lame. My other kid's mini chimis looked appetizing and he liked them, but they ruined the dish by putting this brightly artificially colored red mini tostada bowl on the plate filled with sour cream that had been sitting in the refrigerator either uncovered, or at the wrong temperature because it had a yellowish brown layer of old cream on the top that was just gross. Apparently they make those up ahead of time too with no quality control. Also it was very hot inside the restaurant which worried me about the safety and sanitation of the kitchen. I agree with others that the service was friendly, when they were actually there. I think it's a bit overpriced, for the quality. We spent $115 with tip, but that was two margaritas and one desert, 3 entrees, one app, one kids meal. I'd rather of had Taco Bell. And the chips were no big deal. If you've made chips at home and experienced what they taste like you would never want restaurant ones again. The texture, freshness, flavor can't be beat. I know what you are all thinking. Stay home then and cook. I usually do for just this reason. Oh and one more thing. The apple sopapilla desert was terrible. The pastry dough was chewy, and lacked salt. Tasted like chewy dish rag."}
{"text":"The first time we went service was good,and the food was decent. The second time we went service was not so great, and I got food poisoning. The white sands chimichanga has canned meat and not meat off the bone. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"We just left there from having lunch which I regret, and wish we would've went to The Olive Garden or Oreganos nearby.  We were greeted immediately. The outside of the restaurant and the lobby entrance looked nice so we had high expectations. As soon as we turned the corner I felt a complete shift, and the atmosphere was extremely cold and uncomfortable! It was dark, outdated, cheesy decor, quiet music. The servers seemed absolutely miserable and I don't think I saw any of them smile once the whole time we were there even the one who waited on us. She was very cold just like the atmosphere. Very straight to the point, unfriendly and inattentive. The rest of their workers just stood around and looked very unmotivated and unhappy. The food was okay but nothing worth coming back for and didn't taste authentic at all. The rice, beans, and salsa were extremely bland! They charge $2.50 for a tiny scoop/side of guacamole. Huge rip off!  Anyways to sum it up, the servers need better training on how to actually be a good, attentive, and happy servers, the cheesy dollar tree-looking decor needs to GO- make it more MODERN! And the food needs more personality. Seriously everything about that place was uncomfortable and not great at all.  Won't be coming back but it was worth a shot I guess.  If you want authentic mexican food try a few of the places on Dysart Rd. WAY BETTER! I work in the professional field of the restaurant industry and this was far from it. I'd give no stars but Yelp makes you give at least one."}
{"text":"Just an update to my earlier review ... had dinner at Arriba's on Christmas Day (one of the few places that was open!) ... it was crowded and busy ... not too long of a wait for a table ... the food was very decent, very spicy, no complaints at all about the food ... and the service was better than I've experienced there before (I think it was due to table location), but still have issue with ambiance, and lack of upbeat attitude amongst the employees (although my server was just fine - the hostess staff was working with a chip on their shoulders!)."}
{"text":"I do t know what to say other than it's a shame that they cannot staff the restaurant and tone down the heat in the food just a tad. Came in told 30 months min wait. Waited 1 hour and finally got seated. Over 20 plus tables available but not seated which means they don't have the staff. Not what you hope for dining out. Second we are born and raised eating hot food in south TX and the pepper heat is way too much. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great salsa, bean dip, and menu selection. The spinach enchilada was delicious. Didn't get to try there home brew. I would return"}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday. Great service, very tentative and accommodating. The food was great! Everyone was so pleasant and nice."}
{"text":"There was a lot of food for $6.   Love the Hatch chiles. So good and I am stuffed!!!"}
{"text":"No issues and enjoyed the food.  Opposite to many reviews our service was prompt, timely and correct.  Food was tasty, plenty hot (temp and spice)."}
{"text":"Liked the cheese crisp --it was truly crispy.  The salsa was fresh. The fajita quesadilla was amazing!  The quesadilla veggies were cooked just right, they used grilled chicken instead of pulled chicken and the jalapeño cream cheese was delicious!  Service was excellent.  Got there just after 10 PM for a late dinner date with my hubby, and they didn't hassle us for coming in at that time and ordering a full dinner, even with the restaurant closing at 11.  We were out the doors by 10:50.  Will go back again.  Margaritas aren't very strong and they're kind of a rip off."}
{"text":"Not good at all.  I had the taco salad and it was huge but no flavor in the chicken and very bland boring salad. My husband had the chili rellano with shredded beef.  The shredded beef was put on top of the crispy fried goodness which made it super soggy. Not good eats.  The place was dead - it seems they have a lot of happy hour & drink specials and thats what they cater to. As for the food - skip it unless your happy with just chips and salsa.  This was a spur of the moment stop and it was close to home.  They are many other food choices so I'll definitely take advantage of the others in the area."}
{"text":"The food was fine. My only issue was that most dishes were spicy, even when our waiter recommended them as non spicy, they still turned out to have a lot of spice in them. Their meat ball soup was good but missing something and felt incomplete. Guacamole was good but spicy. Shrimp fajitas were fine, but nothing extraordinary. Overall good experience but not wow."}
{"text":"Food was okay, I was expecting more while in Gilbert.  Service was good no complaints there just was expecting a less chain type experience."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and was looking for a place to watch the laker game and a local suggested arriba. The place itself is okay looking and the people who work there are really nice. They have flat screens on the walls in the bar area and a few smaller tv's so it was a cool place to watch the game. The food was really good, we got some cheese dip and guacamole dip also a plate of carne asada tacos which was yummy. My hubby even took a carne asada burrito to go. I'm giving it 4 stars because the strawberry virgin margarita i ordered didn't really take taste that good but overall it was a cool experience."}
{"text":"I went in at 11:30 AM to beat the rush and got seated quickly and had my order placed within a couple of minutes.  Not more than 5 minutes later my food was ready.  I ordered the chimichanga with ground beef.  Nice mix of spices, but not too heavy which is what I like.  Some places tend to add too much to ground beef and it dominates the taste.  The rice has a pepper mix added to it which wasn't to my liking, but to each his own.  The beans could use more flavor or maybe some cheese on top to mix in.  The server and bus boy were both friendly and came around very often.  Overall the chimi was great, the place was clean, and the service was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place! The chips were warm, the salsa had a little bit of a kick but not too much, and the bean dip was perfect. I had cheese enchiladas. Their sauce is right on, the size of the enchiladas were on the smaller side. I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious and the restaurant is clean. Staff is nice, particularly Liz! She is an awesome waitress. Cute personality, remembers you, and great service!!! ¡¡Arriba Arriba Arriba!!"}
{"text":"During our family vacation, we ate here twice - once for brunch and then for dinner.  Brunch was really good - food had a great taste and very spicy, so we couldn't wait to go back for dinner.  Unfortunately, while dinner was good, the margaritas were awful.  My local joint in Georgia is way better.  We were so surprised with all of the Tequila ads everywhere, one would think that margaritas in Phoenix would be awesome - but not here!  By the way, this place also brews their own beer - it is the WORST possible - by no means should you attempt to try it, SOUR - YUCK!"}
{"text":"The food was like.... Whoa!    the Long Island Iced Tea is a little on the small side though. I would like to see a \"fish bowl\" size Long Island next time I go in. service was very good even as busy as it was on a Sunday. I had a GROUPON for it all too!!  for my first time is I would say I'm a fan!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Outdoor patio with waterfall. Ordered the Taco Salad and Chile Relleno. Service was average. Margaritas looks great!"}
{"text":"Finally doing a review after visiting Arriba's for years. This past stay stuck with the Chimichanga with Machaca beef covered in Green Sauce. Loved it! Over the years got the Posole (since I have a Posole addiction); but I resisted this time. If you like spicy head to Arriba's. They also have great margaritas, had the mango margarita. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Surprised by this place. Price for the food is way too good. I was impressed with the flavor of the food and the drinks. Service was ok and the atmosphere was cool. If you're not trying to impress someone and want a good meal, it's a great Mexican go to place. Things to improve upon would be getting new menus and new seats for the booths. Menus don't really cover the drinks so you have to ask. Hopefully your server is knowledgable otherwise, not too business savvy to not have drinks for customers to savor for. On the plus side of that menu, they should keep the pictures of the plates. It adds a different dimension to the food craving."}
{"text":"Next time I should ask them if they can tone down the chili pepper heat a bit, at least for my order. The White Sands Chimichanga dinner I ordered was tasty, but the heat level was a lot more than I was comfortable with, and I usually enjoy spicy food. It would probably have been a much more enjoyable meal if it weren't partly like torture trying to finish the fiery food. The service was very friendly and attentive, and the place has a nice and informal, if kitschy, look."}
{"text":"Their hot sauce is mild. I requested  the hot who h is much better.  The bean dip is flavorful.  And good fresh  chips . Tried both carnitas and machaca  with green sauce.  This meal was much better"}
{"text":"This place is always packed in the evening and we had to go check it out. I was a little afraid honestly while waiting seeing so many reviews of just 1 star. The service could use some work, but they seemed extremely busy. There was several table tops of 6+ coming in while we were waiting to be seated on a Saturday Night. One table top of 11 came in as well while we were waiting.    I don't think they are very expensive compared to Macayo's in the area. The one good thing they do have is the 48oz Margarita's for 2. They definitely don't skip the the alcohol, and their Margarita's are pretty cheap. You can get a 48oz (depending on the style) for at least 11$ which is crazy! I asked if they will serve a 48oz margarita for two for one, and they said they would. I think this could be dangerous for margarita lovers..   I had their mexican abodabba pizza and it was very good I thought. My wife had their chimmy, and I wasnt a fan of it. I think its just OK in the land of mexican food out there, but their drinks definately stand out on their own."}
{"text":"Me and my friends went in last night and ordered food , we've been here before in the past and of course we come for the food even tho the service is never great ! last night that changed, we were waited by this waiter by the name of yuri or something like that , it was her first day on the job and let me tell you , this girl was amazing . Her section was full and busy . Great smile , great attitude , awesome personality and most of all she never forgot us and the order was perfect ! Although it was her first day working here she definitely  deserved her tip which i never tip that much at the place . She definitely deserves 5 stars ! If I'm able to request her next time I'll do so ."}
{"text":"Seats are horrible. It's time to update this place. Booths have lumpy seats and tables rock back and forth.. oh, and the bean dip is not up to par. Hope dinner is good."}
{"text":"The chips, salsa and bean dip were good!  However, as a proud native New Mexican you have missed the target by a long shot! The red chili was weak and too thin - the green was good, but not prepared per New Mexican tradition, nor the ground beef! I won't be back as I was hoping for a Papa Felipes or Los Cuates experience, but that takes a 400 mile drive! I wish you the best!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 3 times and it has gotten worse each time . The food is never fresh I won't be back . I'll drive 6 miles  farther to Carlos Obriens."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased, but I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars! You see, I'm a California transplant to the East Coast, and let me tell you their Mexican restaurants are terrible!!! While I was in Phoenix, I specifically asked the hotel receptionist about a really good Mexican place and she directed me to Arriba's  I had the white chimichanga and asked them to substitute the pork with chicken, which they had no problem doing. It was fantastic!!! I also ordered a margarita, which was huge!!! and also very good. I wanted to order the flan, but I was so stuffed from good food that I couldn't even order dessert.   I ate with a co-worker and unlike one of the other reviews, they did not have an issue with splitting our bill.   I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Phoenix area... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Gross. This tastes nothing like Mexican food. Tastes like they heated up some Jose Ole in the micro. Never going back. I didn't even pay for this meal and I can't think of one good thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"I had the Arriba Pollo Con Queso. Deliciouso and only $10.59 for tons of food.  Festive environment. The booths in the bar area a little snug."}
{"text":"When in Arizona -- try Mexican food. Definitely in Hawai'i, you don't get authentic Mexican food, so I'm glad my friend took me to get some! First off, portion sizes are humongous! Definitely worth the price!  The atmosphere made you feel like you're in a real cantina; lively and definitely spacious. Staff and service were wonderful. Always made sure to re-fill waters and chips -- unlimited chips and dip plus salsa.  I ordered the Pecos Sour Cream Enchiladas which were two corn tortillas with chicken and sour cream, covered with green or red sauce. Also served with choice of beans and rice! Very filling and quite delicious! My friend is a very spicy food person and ordered the Hatch Chile Relleno which was a Chile covered with ranchero sauce and stuffed with jack cheese. Served with the same fixings.  Super glad that my friend took me here; only wish I could get this in Honolulu."}
{"text":"The food and service was AMAZING! This was my first time eating at Arriba's and I will definitely come back. I had the beef street tacos with a side of beans and rice. Everything tasted great! There were two ladies that greeted us when we first came in. The hostess was very welcoming. Our waitress was very nice and took good care of us. The manager even came to our table to check on us. Great restaurant all around! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A really great place to hang, eat some great food and have drinks. Service is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Has anyone in this place ever eaten Mexican food?  I get that your customers are mainly white people, but I'm sure they would love the real thing.  The waitress was really nice."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and atmosphere abut the service has been slow on two different occasions."}
{"text":"This was in-between, because my husband's Rio Grande Enchiladas were amazing, but my beef burrito was pretty gross (old chewy meat and a flour tortilla that tasted like the fridge)."}
{"text":"Had an amazing early dinner yesterday on one of the most awesome patios. It was cozy with a wonderful fountain. I was craving a taco and ended up having the daily special... a taco, enchilada beans and rice for $4.99! Their house margaritas are only $1.99 I had a fantastic server named Wesley who I learned will be leaving soon to the Air Force. I'm sure he will be missed as part of the Arribas crew... thank you for your service Wesley!"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are fabulous - but after that, the food was mediocre at best.  I have chili verde at every Mexican restaurant as a measure of their quality.  Arribas chili verde sauce was exquisite, but the pork was cut into small pieces, making the meat a little tougher than I like.  The tortillas were top-notch, and the charro beans were spicy and delicious!  My wife's rio grande enchiladas, however, were disgusting.  The cheese sauce tasted like bad queso out of a can!  Really overpowering and the adobada was barely noticeable under that swamp of queso.    Go for the chili verde!  It was decent; above average.  The exterior is very warm and inviting, the staff, however, are aloof and unfriendly, except for the wait staff.  Our server was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Gave them another chance, hoping the staff had changed, or been trained. Glad we did. Service wasn't outstanding, but acceptable. Food was great. With a lesson in customer service, this could be a five star."}
{"text":"Food was ok their margaritas for $1 sick they taste like nyquil nasty!! The green sauce is pretty good and the fajitas are good. The chips and salsa very taste less. But what to expect of a chain restaurant??"}
{"text":"For all of the hype that this place gets, I was extremely disappointed in the food, the service, and the price. The food was probably the least disappointing of the three, as it felt a bit more authentic than your typical Mexican food chain. I will admit that I didn't try any of their well-known hatch chilies. For the price, this food didn't make par.  The service was awful. We were visited at most twice by our waiter, once for our order and once for the check."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area and thought we would try it out as we both live Mexican food.  I got the shrimp tacos, they were great and I left very full and satisfied.  The House Margaritas for 1.99 were great as well.  Our server was very pleasant.  I would recommend this place for service and good food at a great value.  Oh and I loved the rice as well!  Double rice!"}
{"text":"Do not ever forget to drain the ground beef before you put it on the Mexican pizza!  Attention to detail is imperative when you are running a busy restaurant next to a popular mall and this place missed the mark when we went there.  Sorry for the low mark, but I will raise it if someone from the restaurant acknowledge this review, because I know, this could have been an isolated incident."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my experience here. The service was horrible had to ask for napkins twice and waited 10 minutes after asking for a refill for my drink. The food was mediocre at best. I should have read all the Yelp reviews before eating here. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Three words.. gourmet chicken tacos. You must try the tacos. This place is always a great option for lunch or dinner any day. They have a good salsa bar. This place is always better and fresher than anybertos restaurant. Come eat here"}
{"text":"I came to this place my gf. WOW literally the best experience in a while. Our server Stevie was best! She was informative about all the food . She gave us great suggestions and we took her best to suggestions ate them and had a great meal We had Pollo con queso and chile verde. A gigantic beautiful Blue Margarita for two. Our meals were incredible!! I suggest if you can take the heat get the chili Verde. I got hot and it didn't disappoint. They can handle huge crowds, or small ones. They filled up quick for lunch. I honestly will not only go back but refer and ask to be seated in Stevie's section. She herself deserves 5 stars. I heard her talking to the table behind us, she was giving great help to the gluten free people also. She's a great asset to this business. She told us about the owner and his sad story. Gosh..I just left feeling full, happy, and like I got 100%great service. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"New to the Phoenix area and planning to check out as much Mexican food as possible. This was our first stop because it's close to where we live. The food was pretty good. Nothing special or fancy, just your typical Mexican food. Our order took a while to come out but other than that decent service."}
{"text":"The only reason this place even gets two stars is because of our waiter, he was very nice and fairly attentive.  The food was blah and bought, not made.  It started with the tostitos tasting chips, maybe not even that good. The salsa was boring, even tasting a little like Pace.  I had a burrito, rice, and beans, pretty standard.  The meat in the burrito was ok, nothing to write home about, but not bad.  The tortilla, again tasting like it was from a store had very little taste.  The red sauce was awful, straight out of the can.  The rice had very little to no flavor, but I will say the refried beans had  decent flavor.  Plus... $1.99 for a dollop of sour cream and $2.49 for the same in guacamole...are you kidding!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 6   5 of us had decent food but one had ordered the steak. We all tried a piece this was one of the toughest piece of meat I ever had in my life.Leather like. Service was good and the drinks were awesome. But if that was typical of their steaks avoid at all cost"}
{"text":"About 38 years ago I discovered Mexican Restaurants with their food served on hot plates. Ask yourself this question-Of all the restaurants you dine in, which serves its hot food on hot plates? We serve home cooked meals on hot plates as a bar was set by Mexican Restaurants.  We've been dining in Arriba Meican Grill for years. Is it true Mexican food? It's more like Americanized Mexican Food which is ok with me. On November 28, 2012, we had lunch here as we were nearby. Service is always great! Seated right away with chips/salsa served along with our drinks. The serves watch you drink levle as refills appear without request.  For this visit, we orderd a lunch size Guacamole, lunch size spinach Enc/Flauta and a lunch size shredded beef Burrtio plate. By rhe time we were done with our chips.our meals arrived on the hot plates that keeps the meal warm until you're finished.  Food and service has always been great during our experiences here. We highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this review 2 stars was our service, otherwise it should be a  negative rating. Our chicken was overprocessed/frozen and no flavor. The tortillas were not cooked and their local brew beer tasted like dishwater!! Very sad and disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited this afternoon with my girlfriend Double Dee.  I ordered two ground beef tacos, a cheese enchilada, rice and beans.   The bad, the ground beef lacked flavor. The good, huge portions of food and drink which any local family of pachyderms would approve of.  Double Dee ordered beef fluatas and approved. Three salsas, mild, hot and a excellent bean and cheese.  I ordered a house chardonnay while Double Dee devowered a prickly pear margarita. Both drinks were big a could easily count as two drinks as we stumbled out with our doggie bags. Recommended."}
{"text":"I love the food, but what would put this place over the top to give it a 5 star rating would be if they change the Tortillas. They taste like store bought and since it has some great flavors, the tortillas would top it off. Just my suggestion, I think everyone would agree."}
{"text":"I had a groupon to this place, so we went last Saturday.  I have to say I wasn't expecting much, but I love Mexican food, grew up on it, as I was born and raised in Az, and it's my favorite, so I'm always willing to eat a taco or a burrito, even a bad one.  So we start out with chips and salsa.  I have to say, I was very surprised by how spicy it was!  My daughter got the mild salsa, but mine and the bean dip put a fire in my belly that was unexpected and pleasing to my palate!    I got a red chili burrito with green sauce and rice and beans.  My daughter got a chicken burrito with red sauce and rice and beans.  Megan's food was probably a 3, chicken was ok.  But mine was divine!  The meat was in large meaty chunks, very lean and tender.  The sauce was very spicy, and the green sauce on top also was very spicy and had a great taste.   Beans tasted good and were also very spicy.  The only thing that was just ok was the rice.  I ate it, but it was just ok.  And the service was also great.  Lots of diet coke refills because of the spicy food.  I would go back to this place in a heartbeat again and again."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Being from Los Angeles, we are spoiled with plenty of authentic Mexican restaurants and Arriba's did not disappoint. I love the hatch chile addition to many of the specialities. There were also $1.99 house margaritas being offered during our visit - you can't beat that! Worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The food here is always good classic Sonoran fair with a little bit more heat using the New Mexico Hatch chilis then standard Sonora style restaurants in the valley. The rice and beans are pretty classic there are no surprises and no disappointments the service is about the same, nothing great but not disappointing either and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Ok so house beer C- I did get the chicken grilled with beans and they were a solid C+   Service was good and they did take the beer off but everything was just ehhh.  Gave the the three not two ONLY because they are prices \"OK\""}
{"text":"My wife and I love it here!  Check out their $0.99 taco tuesdays... Plus they have margaritas for $0.99 from 4-7pm during the weekdays!"}
{"text":"First mexican food I tried in Arizona it was bland and tasteless! Really, I was extremely disappointed and this place was recommended!!  It was pricey for dinner and so not worth the money, I have to say I may try it again maybe I ordered the wrong thing!!  Lovely atmosphere, friendly staff but husband and I both were disappointed, we both had something different.  I see the commercials and wonder where they were when I was there.  How can you mess up tacos?????"}
{"text":"After 10 years, I am giving this place another try.  i don't know why I waited so long.  Service was great and the Cheese Crisp was awesome.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Like a glutton for punishment, here I went again in hopes it'd be better. My daughter wanted to go for the guac she apparently likes. Well there's a sign outside that says, \"Kids eat FREE Sundays\". So I called BEFORE I went and asked if it was either lunch/dinner. Girl said both were fine, no limits. I went in and ordered the $8 pozole, (which is like a meaty meal) and guac and another dip plus drinks. Then ordered my kids meal and server claimed I wouldn't get it free though. Wow, like how much does a kid eat????? Hardly anything. I was like, \"There were no details on having to order a combo dinner meal in order to get free kids meal\". The manager literally tries to make me feel bad about it and says he'll give it to me this time but not expect it ever again. He said, \"We want people to spend money in order to get the free kids meal\".  Horrible customer service (no hello or thanks for coming from employees) dirty, mediocre food and just sad.....SAVE YOUR TIME & MONEY FOR BETTER."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop in at Arriba for our weekly date night.  I ordered the white sands chimichanga and my wife ordered the carnitas.  My overall impression was underwhelming.  My chimichanga was covered in a white cheese that tasted like velveta (gross) and the tortilla was quite tough.  My wife's carnitas were good but were $16.00 which I find to be too high.  The one good thing were the server and manager.  Both were very friendly and attentive.  My wife had a question about the cream cheese they used and the manager found out and told us.  So kudos for that.  All in all I was unimpressed and would not bring my business here when there are so many better options in my opinion."}
{"text":"Read this before considering this establishment.  I urge you to seek good Mexican food elsewhere.  Everything about this place is sub standard and recently we had one of the poorest dining experiences possible.  We had 645 reservations for 3/14/2015 and our entire party of 12 arrived by 635.  There was no table ready for us and we waited until 730 to be seated on the patio which was not the preference.  It took 10 minutes for drink orders,  15 minutes for first round of chips, 30 minutes to get our drinks and then order and almost an hour to get our food.  We were not provided refills and had to ask several times before we finally sought a manager inside the restaurant to assist. When food did arrive, 4 of 12 guests reported \"cold\" temperature, one plate was sent back given order taken incorrectly and then the whammy... The waiter advised me, \"My manager would not come out but told me to tell you that you can NEVER order this plate again as we do not offer it on our menu. This is the first and last time we will do this.\"  I was shocked and asked why the manager did not relay the message himself and the waiter had no response.  Our table then asked for the manager (name- JD) who came out 15 minutes later and acknowledged that he did in fact say it. He further advised he was sorry we did not like his comment but we needed to know.  Long of short, it was the waiter who actually recommended this combo plate including the fillings (2 poblano chilis) and the order was placed based on the recommendation so how is it possible this is wrong?  After 2 hours of one disaster after another, an apology from the waiter for being loaded up with no help, we paid our bills of which 2 of the 4 were inaccurate and had over $12 worth of charges for items nto ordered.  We were so frustrated we simply paid, asked for the district managers card and left.  PLEASE take your hard earned money elsewhere. You do have choices in Gilbert and deserve a much better experience.  I will be sharing our Arriba food experience with many given it was wrong in so many ways."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chain restaurants but Arribas seemed to be a local chain so I decided to try it during a visit to Phoenix. It was the best Mexican food I have had in a long time. Some may argue the food quality but I am a sucker for large margaritas and a Mariachi band. Most Mexican places I visit on the East Coast are afraid to make anything spicy but Arriba has heat indicators listed on the menu. Try one of the 2 or 3 chili listings if you like spicy."}
{"text":"I'm confused. Again, and yes I know, shocker, right?  Arriba (whether you can roll your R's or not), in Spanish means Go. And yes, while I like to \"go\" to Arriba's', a more fitting Spanish name is probably Caliente, meaning hot.  And since we're getting to the end of my considerable Spanish vocualry, it's probably time to start a new paragraph and stay in English.  If you're read my Carlos O'Brien's review you can see my assertion that many of the Valley's Mexican restaurants are somewhat interchangeable, Popo's, Valle Luna, CO, etc.  Arriba takes a left hand turn when most of these are going right. To put it another way, the secret to Arriba's is our neighborly neighbor to the East, New Mexico and their incredible Hatch Chilies. Many of the selections on their menu contain Hatch chilies and it raises the culinary (used loosely) level here.  The flavor profiles are worth exploring.    The P and I visited this Arriba's on a beautiful Saturday for lunch prior to a little Christmas shopping.  It was a great choice, a couple of cervases with lime, excellent chips and salsa (hot, mild, and bean dip) and some great entrees on the patio out front.  The P went with a bowl of Hatch Chile stew with chicken and some guacamole.  She loved it and it was a generous enough portion to bring half of it home.  This little piggy went with the Hatch Chile enchiladas with a tomatillo/cilantro sauce over the top and the obligatory rice and beans.  Good thing we went over to the Arrowhead Mall for a couple of hours, I needed to walk that bad boy meal off!  The service was attentive, the food was hot, fresh, and as advertised.  The restaurant itself is starting to show a little age and could use some TLC (hint, hint owners).  Overall, this is a quality little gem of a Mexican restaurant, solid 3.50 stars."}
{"text":"Tonight, I returned to a restaurant that I hadn't visited since I was a little girl: Arriba Mexican Grill (ohhh, the name takes me back!). I was quite worried that the service and food wouldn't be up to snuff due to some of the reviews on here. Yeah... I was wrong. SO SO SO SO WRONG. THIS PLACE ROCKS. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY. *gobbles enchiladas and burritos at a frighteningly rapid rate*  Arriba Mexican Grill was a favorite of mine as a preteen. I would get a smoothie and a cheeseburger while my family stuck to the Mexican dishes.  DRINKS: First came the drinks. To honor the nostalgia for my childhood, I ordered a strawberry/prickly pear smoothie. It arrived promptly, topped with luscious whipped cream and a juicy red cherry. Although the aesthetics were good, the taste was Even Better. I cannot begin to describe how refreshing and beautiful and amazing this smoothie was. Just try it, please.  CHIPS: Next came the chips. I don't know why everyone is claiming that the chips are stale. Maybe they are; perhaps my mother and I were just lucky with a fresh batch. Or maybe some people don't know what a good chip is. A glorious bowl of bean dip + two types of salsa also graced the table. You better bet that I dipped those chips until I was too full to move.  ENTREE: And for the entree, I actually tried a Mexican entree called the Three Enchiladas, which comprised a cheese enchilada + chicken enchilada + beef enchilada AND a smorgasbord of rice with your choice of beans. I went with the deep fried bean option. It tasted like Mexicana heaven, heaped on a colorful, ginormous plate.   (Yes, heaven has sour cream and ground beef. Don't argue.)  My dining partner had the White Sands Chimichanga and praised her own dish profusely. From what I could see, it looked darn good.   AMBIANCE: I have to mention the ambiance. It's friendly, it's beautiful, and it's full of that Latino aura of welcome that always surrounds the greatest and most authentic restaurants. The atmosphere just made me feel happy inside. From the colorful painted walls and multicolored string lights to the dozens of murals and paintings of Mexico's countryside and cities, this place put a smile on my face the second I walked through the door.  SERVICE: Our server was on-point for the entirety of the meal. We were able to order our drinks within two minutes of sitting down and received our food very, very quickly; even I was surprised. I love you, server. He was both kind and efficient. In fact, he laughed with us about the absurd largeness of the portions, an aspect that we all secretly love. Who doesn't like stuffing their face?  Look, Arriba Mexican Grill might have its faults and is probably sucky on some of its busiest nights. But, if you're lucky and open-minded like myself, then you might strike a home run with a well-made Mexican meal that you'll remember for a lifetime. I can't guarantee anything... all I know is that I'm coming back here Very Very Soon, and I'm bringing all my friends."}
{"text":"Where to start. I am still upset.  My husband and I usually avoid chains, but since we had the twins we are getting more intimate with some chains.  We were trying to find a new one since the other two we go to have been beaten to death.  With two year old twins choices are a little scary.  I went along and agreed to go to Arriba.  Last time we were there was 4 years ago and it was your typical mediocre fare, which is fine for a quick lunch during work week. First we order for the kids, the chicken fingers and what I thought would be strawberry smoothies.  What a surprise when I had a sip and realized it was a virgin strawberry daiquiri. I was giving my twins pink sugar water.  Not the end of the world.  I ordered some milk.  Then my husband and I were going to share the chicken fajita quesadilla.  The waiter, Omar, seemed fairly nice.  He came by a second time to verify if I wanted beef quesadilla, and I told him \"No, I want chicken, no beef please\".  Then he pushed for us to add the guacamole and sour cream, which I said fine to bring it with it and I repeated \"chicken quesadilla\". When it came the quesadilla looked like a sad greased soaked blanket.  My biggest surprise came when I took a bite and guess what I found? \"Beef\".  I had to spit it out and call Omar, I explained to him this was a beef quesadilla, he gave me this puzzled face and asked: You didn't want beef? I thought it was a joke, by that time the twins were getting rowdy and they had not touch the rock hard fried to death chicken fingers.  So I told him to take off the quesadilla and we would pay for everything else we didn't eat but had ordered.  Afterwards we called from the car and talked to the manager. He wanted to do \"something for us\", but I told my husband I didn't want to go back, so we didn't accept anything.  I guess CPK with the kids again."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Arriba's Mexican Grill for years but only recently got around to going. A friend of mine was visiting from back east and we went here for lunch. I have to say I think Arriba's is a far better place than Macayos. found the food, service and prices to all be great. If you go at lunch time they have specials and I mean huge chimis and burritos for like $6.00 and the portions are more than adequate. We each got a lunch special and shared the loaded nachos which were hands down some of the best I've ever had. If you have room for desert they also have some really good choices. I've read some say the service is slow but I didn't experience this. Wait time was only like 10 minutes from order to the table which is really about average. In the mean time they bring you tortilla chips with a mild and hot salsa and a bean dip. No complaints. I have already recommended to others and will return!"}
{"text":"Here I sit not sure why I come back. They have great happy hour prices but the service has always been horrible. Been over 10 minutes seated and have yet to be approached for even a drink.   When I ask for service I am told my server while be right out??? No ownership to help a guest.....  Still waiting."}
{"text":"We were served by Moses and had a great time. Food came out very fast and absolutely phenomenal. There was never a drink empty and Moses constantly checked up on us to make sure we were satisfied. Great job!!"}
{"text":"NOT IMPRESSED! First of all you DO NOT get rice and beans you have to choose between the two or be charged extra. Me and my daughter shared fajitas and they were not good. They weren't sizzling when we got them...and I saw someone trying to light them up with a lighter or something which is weird.  My husbands chimichanga was NASTY! It tasted just like they took canned nacho sauce and mixed it with something and dumped it over the top!  They charge us extra for 2 tiny tortillas for our fajitas.  The service was mediocre and they weren't very clean.  We will not return!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. The fried ice cream was overpriced, and stale. But to top it off the manager, JD was rude. We had a large party and we all were paying separately. two of our party had to leave early, and the waitress accidentally didn't get one of their items on their bill. We didn't realize it until the end of the night. The item was $5. The manager came out and told our table that if we didn't all help pay for the item, that it would be taken out of the waitresses paycheck. We were all shocked that he would be so inconsiderate to his wait staff. But also have the audacity to essentially tell us it would be our fault if it was taken out of her check. This is ridiculous! Especially since the cost of the food is less than 20% of the price of what you are paying.They just lost 15 potential customers over a $1 scoop of ice cream. Such poor customer service we will never go here again - poor management!! I left with the impression that JD, the manager, is a contemptible person who I never want to encounter again."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times when I am in the area, always been pretty good for me, food is much  better than I can get in Texas. Beef chimi is excellent, decent cheese crisp too. No issues with the service, not super fast but not deal breaking slow either."}
{"text":"Mmmm... Our food was delicious. Service on a Saturday night on the other hand was a little slow. But understandable because it was busy. With the guacamole we ordered we had a total of 4 dips and it was hard to choose which was best. They we all great. My husband preferred the spicy bean dip, but I'm sure I'll regret that choice later. I got the hatch chile relleno and it was pretty spicy but tasty. I highly recommend this restaurant. I'm sure we will be going back."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, service slow when they weren't even crowded AND they charged $1.99 for sour cream!!!!!!!!  If you go .... don't order sour cream on the side.  What a rip!"}
{"text":"Busy Sunday brunch, went with another family after church.  Overall everything was good.  Server was on the chip, salsa, and drink refill!!!  Wait time was a little long but it was Sunday brunch so no complaints there.  Minus one star because food was \"okay\" but not 5 star worthy.  It wasn't hot and kind of dry/hard.  I ordered the pollo con queso which I've had before and it was better."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Arriba in ages...what's wrong with me?  :-)  Started with Queso Fundido (well, chips and salas and bean dip - spicy bean dip - yeah, baby!  Then the Queso).  Our server asked if we wanted chorizo in it?  Half the table said no, so he put some on one side.  Good thing - I don't think the chorizo really fit the flavor profile of the queso fundido.  It was served flaming - cool effect!  I ordered the New Mexico style Enchiladas (flat, stacked), but asked to have a fried egg on top (to make it more New Mexican).  I went with the spicy red sauce option.  The flavors were good, but the tortillas were a little on the tough/hard side - almost needed a knife to cut them.  Still, tasted really good - and had  enough to have them again for lunch today (and I fried another egg for the leftovers :-))  Everybody in our party enjoyed their meals - what more can you ask?  Give 'em a go!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and our server was patient with us. Two moms and two babies not always the best table to have.   We were seat right away and we took forever to figure out what we wanted to order. Our server remained friendly and never made us feel rushed. I really wish I remembered his name.   I'm sure we will be back for our monthly mommy/baby lunch."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place for Mexican food.  But it is decent. Usually is packed so they definitely appeal to a lot of folks. Place is clean and the staff is nice. I get the chicken chimi, it is okay. Chips and salsa are good, so that is a plus. If you want Mexican food and are close to Arrowhead Mall. Drop in you may find something you like."}
{"text":"I came here on the lunch hour......and to my surprise the service was quick! (I ordered to go). The food was great too! Definitely going to come back here again!"}
{"text":"No No No... I don't know why I keep going back. Had a server named Dean a few times & he treated the whole table like crap. Food sucks but the margaritas & salsa are good."}
{"text":"Love the bean dip that comes before the meal.   Can't beat the heat from the WHITE SANDS CHIMI...  My favorite!!"}
{"text":"Went in with the hubby and the kids. We have 4 kids, 2 in high chairs so the 5 min wait was no problem. What was a problem was that the minute I sat down, one of the benches in the front ripped a hole in my previously perfectly fine $50 jeans. I told the hostess who seemed not very concerned and apparently the manager wasn't told as I requested.... After being seated, it took several minutes to get a server, including water to go with the too spicy salsa and beans. We ended up getting several appetizers because of the happy hour special. We had the nachos, mini- chimis, the hatch chili cheese crisp, and the queso dip. Our server seemed very inattentive and not at all helpful. He was not overly friendly, could not keep up with water, and forgot the side of beans we requested for our little ones. ( which means we had to go home and feed them because eventually we just said forget it!) All of the food was mediocre and was barely worth the half off happy hour price. The hatch chili cheese crisp was even too spicy for the hubby who likes spicy food. The chimis were ok, the jalapeño cream was too thick. The queso was hot, although it tasted like it came out if a can. The nachos were plentiful, but seemed like the beef was not good quality. Overall with the hole in my jeans, the bad, inattentive service, and the mediocre, too-spicy food, we will not be back. I would not recommend this Mexican restaurant. If you want good service, good quality, and good prices, go to Manuel's about 2-3 miles East on McDowell."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love the Arriba's on Camelback so much we thought we could go to Arriba's anywhere.  We went to the Arriba's on Bell Rd. at 79th Avenue yesterday,  it just was not the same.  The mexican pizza was just so bland,  there was no seasoning in the meat,  they gave us only two kinds of salsa (pico de gallo and charro beans)  I did use all of the pico,  but the charro bean dip/salsa was just hot and bland,  not real flavor.  We threw away our leftovers, they weren't tempting at all,  this is why some people are thin,  they eat here where the food doesn't taste good.  Camelback....here I come,  I will never betray you again."}
{"text":"Very good food different kinds of salsa and each one is excellent.  Wonderful service, no complaints about any servers.  Now for the food,  very, very good food,  chimichangas, burritos, tacos, pizza, charro beans, rice and the mexican pizzas.  LET ME JUST SAY it is all VERY YUMMY!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed Happy Hour at Arriba in Goodyear this evening. We sat at the bar and placed our bar and appetizer into the bartender. Service was slow, but we were enjoying talking and the All-Star Baseball Game. He told us about 45 minutes later of our soups were not ready, but if we would like the chicken cheese crisp appetizer. We replied yes, and it was brought out, witht he soups following. It was good, but we barely touched the chicken tortilla  soup. Our check was presented to us,and we noticed the l Mexican Pizza was not part of the 1/2 of Happy Hour. He mentioned to us he told us the  bottom two were not applicable to the Happy Hour, where both my husband and I did not hear it. We paid for it, and will not return to Arriba. Service took awhile, and they were not that busy for a hot July Tuesday night. I wish them well."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst places I've ever been to. Horrible service. We sat for 10 minutes while servers looked at us as they passed, but no server came to talk to us. When I finally approach someone I was told not to take it out on her. So I didn't and I called the manager over. He was full of apologies but not much else. My family and I left and we went someplace better. Don't waste your time on this place when there are a multitude of other better places close by."}
{"text":"I had heard terrible reviews on this place but decided to give it a try anyway.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised at how amazing the food was and the service was a+ as well, even went back a few days later.  The only down fall was that some of the employees would congregate by the bar area, goof off and be really inappropriate.  My advice is to notify the management if you see this behavior so they finally understand that this is the main reason they have a bad rep!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Arriba for awhile. I am not a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants.  My cousin was in town to assist me while recovering from a surgery. He mentioned he wanted Mexican food. He graduated from the Scottsdale Culinary Institute and is a food snob, so I am VERY careful when I suggest a place. Arriba was in the list of Mexican places when I checked Yelp on my phone. I had been wanting to try Arriba  and so I warned him that I had not been there before. They did not let me down.  Chips - Hot when they came to the table (I like my chips served like that!). The hot sauces and beans that come with it were good as well except the tomato based sauce - tastes like canned tomatoes. Luckily they have others to dip the chips in.  Ordered some Chili Verde on the side to see if I liked theirs. I did. Very much. Great with the chips too.   I had the enchiladas with the three sauces.  Excellent! He had the seafood enchiladas. He loved them. He gave me a portion to try. It was very good."}
{"text":"Mexican is usually not my first choice but I was quite happy with the food the couple times I've been here. One unique thing about them that I haven't seen elsewhere is the spicy bean dip they provide with the chips and salsa. For people who aren't into spicy, it really has a little kick so be careful. A couple other people who I was dining with weren't expecting it and they were quite surprised when trying it.  Arriba's rates their spice level by a rating scale of 1-3 peppers. I love spicy food so I got the shrimp fajitas last time with the salsa on the side that had a 3 pepper rating. Usually things aren't spicy enough for me but this was indeed spicy and I was very happy with it.  Their 99 cent margarita was a great value as well and the perfect size for someone who can't drink as much like me!  The food is 4 stars but I can't justify that rating because the service is lacking. It can be super slow. We waited 30-45 minutes after we got our bill and wanted to pay so that was not the best ending to our meal."}
{"text":"Alright, mind you this is a second review to my first one 3 years ago. We love Arribas and their food tastes great, and still does. I gave Arribas 4 stars last time, but this time they're lucky to get 2. I'd give the food 5, but the service 0.   Sorry, but not sorry to 'Miguel' our server, but you really need to be retrained on your serving etiquette...  Fri night, got sat, waited almost 20min to get greeted. Then 'Miguel' came up after almost 20min, took our drink order. We tried to give him our full order and he said, 'sorry I can't take your order, I'm not your server.' Then he comes back a little later with waters, chips and salsa and says 'well I guess I am your server'. (Oh and after he greeted us the first time, we saw him turn to a manager talking to her and obviously upset because he thought he was cut or was about to be cut, yet he wasn't and we were his last table.)  So he takes our order, (oh yea we have an 18month old and it's already hard enough dealing with all of this too because it's taken so long). As he takes our order we tell him what we want for our son, he says 'do you want the guac and sour cream with his meal?' Implying that it comes with it. Nope it didn't come with it, we got charged 2.29 and 1.99 for both sides with the kids meal, which were almost the same price as the kids me itself.   Food came out quick, tastes great, yet by then we had been there for almost 45min, our son was well over impatient and ready to go, my wife and I couldn't enjoy our dinner, decided to box up our food and ask for the check to leave without any longer delay... Yet we had to wait for 'Miguel' because he was busy complaining to the busser about the mess his other table left(no pre bussing), looking at his tips and cash left right in front of us from other tables, paying no attention to us.. We had all of our plates stacked and ready for him to grab and all we wanted was boxes and the check. Yet we had to wait until it was convenient for him to come over to us.  Now like I said, we've been to Arribas before, we love the food, always appreciate the service even if it's busy and it takes a little long(it's been worth it). Although when we get neglected, undermined, and screwed into a bad experience/paying for what we didn't order, we really don't appreciate it. MIGUEL was unprofessional, deceiving, and neglectful. Regardless of us being his last table or upset he wasn't cut yet doesn't give him the right to ruin our night. We would've preferred he transferred us to a more appreciative server.  I guess this must be our fault for coming to Arribas on a Friday night at this time, maybe if we waited a little longer until Miguel was officially cut then we would've gotten a better server, or we should've just sat at the bar?  I'm a server myself, been one for 8 years, I know how it is, I understand how it is if it's slow, you think you're going to get cut, or you think you are yet you aren't, it doesn't matter. Transfer the table if you really want to, or have to leave. Your table is your table. Don't take your crappy night out on someone else, not cool.  Oh and don't count/look at your tips (and make reactions) 2 feet away from your other active tables, cmon man!  Who knows when we plan on coming back to Arribas, maybe we'll just get it take out next time to avoid the hassle."}
{"text":"Was cruising for a spot to grab a late night drink in the outer areas of Phoenix. Most places close up by 10 or so - I managed to walk into Arriba for a last call and ordered a frozen margarita.  As late as I was, there was no rushing to get me out and the staff was great about bringing chips and salsa too. The margarita was OK - had better, had worse. Hope to stop in again there to check out the food."}
{"text":"I was impressed by both the service and food. Happy hour specials are great and I enjoyed their hatch Chili's on their quesadilla. Their mini Chili's and flautas were tasty especially with the dip and sauces. Yummy bean dip. We had a large party with two servers who were awesome. They made sure drinks were filled and food was served timely.  I would go back just for the margaritas and to try more food. Plus I thought the prices were quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Ok food at a decent price. Nothing special.  The ladies bathroom was terrible.  Broken sink,  stall door didn't lock, paper towels sitting on counter which were wet. It's nice it's close to the house otherwise wouldn't drive far to go here."}
{"text":"I went to the location in Gilbert today and ordered the spinach enchilada and two chicken flautas lunch. The menu picture displayed an enchilada roughly the diameter of a golf ball, and the flautas shown in the picture were approximately the size of quarters and all appeared to be 7-8 inches long in relation to the plate. The waitress came and was very nice. She asked if I'd like rice and beans as a side. I told her I would. About ten minutes later the food comes out and I'm IMMEDIATELY disappointed. The enchilada was so thin I had to dig in the sauce to find it. Out of curiosity I unfolded it to see if they'd forgotten to put filling in and discovered, (and I'm not exaggerating), around a teaspoon of spinach mixed in with around 2 teaspoons of cheese. Now for the \"Flautas\" lol! They were about five inches long, and couldn't possibly have been as thick as a nickel. I honestly thought they'd mistakenly given me rolled tacos, they hadn't. Then I noticed there was no rice on the plate. I told the waitress about it, and she says, \"Oh no! I said rice OR beans!\" She offered to get me some rice, but didn't specify whether it was gratis or if I'd have to pay, so I declined.  I finish the meal, which LITERALLY took all of 4 minutes. I was still completely hungry. The manager comes in and starts asking how people liked their food. When he got to my table I told him that I was very dissatisfied with the portion size. He says, \"Yeah, a lot of people say they thought the Flautas were too small.\" WHAT?? Lol!! Then when I told him there was virtually no spinach in my enchilada he says, \"I hope you try us again\" and just walks away??? No offer to make it right....NOTHING!! So after NEVER having written a negative review before in thousands of restaurant visits, I felt compelled to. DO NOT VISIT THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"I really love Arriba's however this location was terrible today!  My colleagues and I went to lunch there and as we got our meals my friend noticed a piece of plastic in her food, the type that is used to seal a jar of salsa or something.  She flagged the waitress down and asked that it be remade but in a to go container.  By the time her food came out we were done with our meals so the \"to go\" option on my friends part was smart.  This is when we got upset, they still wanted to charge my friend for the $8 meal that she didn't even get to eat with us, they wanted to give her a free app her next visit and for her to pay for her food.  You would think they could have comped her meal since she had to sit there and watch us eat ours the time we were there.  They said since she was still taking it to go it's not free.  The manager was unfriendly and snatched the food and walked away when we said that she could keep the food, and she definitely didn't leave the appetizer comp card after that.  We paid the two remaining bills and left.  I as a consumer think this could have been handled better.  The appetizer and the meal cost the same, although I'm sure they just cared about the return business not the customer service.  We will not be eating at that location again."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years, but the last two visits have been disappointing. I usually order a green chill burro. Both times it was packed with black pepper.  We won't be going back until this changes."}
{"text":"Great food. Fantastic Service.  Try their been dip. You have never had better. The Pollo Fundido is to die for!  We love this place and will be back."}
{"text":"I'm all about the Chips & Salsa.  My usual Happy Hour fix here: Queso Fundido & Chips and an Iced Tea. Always great service. I can't wait for tomorrow's Happy Hour here. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Ended up spending $40 on a margarita, three beers, and one entree during happy hour. (I still tipped, the waiter was friendly and it's not his fault everything but the Corona tasted like a sweaty butt crack).  The dark bock microbrew tastes like bitter, cheap sake and smelled like margarita mix. The regular margaritas taste like corn syrup and wetnaps. The food was average and way overpriced. The red sauce tastes like spicy, water potting soil. I ate some of my sister's food as I didn't even order anything because they were charging $16 for a freaking chicken fajita. But the worst thing was the swarm of flies buzzing around our table on the newly-enclosed patio. I was swatting the air like a schizophrenic hobo."}
{"text":"2 star may be a bit generous but the food was eatable.... service SUCKED.... and our waitresses had to make it a point to tell that she was still busy do her manager duties from this morning..... Why do we care?? We just wanted a decent lunch, not to here how important our waitresses was....  They weren't  super busy and most of the staff was just standing around talking to each other, so much so that I watched two other tables have to get up and go find their server .... twice!!!! Our food took forever and wasn't great, had the fajitas and the chicken was dry and flavorless and the steak was tuff and WAY over cooked. Food was dropped off at our table with no tortillas and missing all the side that were supposed to go with it..... there was only 4 of us so it wasn't a huge order or anything. Or waitresses went to get tortillas and sides and was gone so long that our food started to get pretty cold..... got my iced tea refilled for the first time as we got the check.....  This was one of the few times I went to eat someplace and didn't check Yelp first.... won't make that mistake again..... our experience seems to mirror the other bad experiences people have posted about.... they have less than 3 stars for a good reason....   Crummy food Crappy service  And staff that appears to careless....  My opinion skip this place and go somewhere that has 3 or more stars on yelp"}
{"text":"I was up in N. Scottsdale today which is quite a trek from the far SE valley, however, I had to run an errand and always look forward to having an excuse to get out of Gilbert.  I've dined at the San Tan Village location which is fairly new and I wasn't overly impressed, but I really enjoyed frequenting this location when I lived and worked in this area from 1999-2002.  Anyway, someone else mentioned that the patio is now enclosed which I did not notice.  We were escorted to a booth in the back of the restaurant near the bar area.  I couldn't help but notice the five BMW's and three Escalades lined up in the parking lot....Toto, I guess we're not in Kansas anymore!  Not that the SE valley is \"the hood\" but it's certainly a different demographic.  So, I digress....I do like the atmosphere at this Arriba as it feels more festive and somewhat livelier than similar restaurants.  And, I LOVE the picture menu and the chips/salsas/bean dip seriously rocks!  As I've stated in many of my previous reviews, I'm extremely price conscious (kindof nazi-ish) since my disposable income has been reduced by about 60% in the last year.  So, I immediately notice that the prices are really HIGH for your \"run of the mill\" mexican fare.  Since it's Sunday, there are no lunch specials and almost everything (with the exception of appetizers) is at least $10 or more.  I opt for the Chicken Tostada (see pics) with rice and charro beans.  At $8.59 it's a fair price and was surprisingly really tasty and filling.  My dining companion is more in the mood for a snack, so he orders the Mini Beef Chimis with jalepeno (I think) cream cheese and sour cream.  Here is where I really  need to rant.  THEY CHARGED AN EXTRA $1.99 FOR A TINY SCOOP OF SOUR CREAM - WTH?.  Yes, I know that I sound like a cheap a**, however, the waiter asked if he wanted sour cream and completely made it sound like it was included in the price.  SCAM!!!  It came right off his tip, I'm sorry to say.    It's not like I'm going to miss $2, it's just the basic principle that some restaurants are trying to make an extra buck....it did not change the fact that I enjoyed my meal, but I will always remember Arriba for being so freakin' cheap.   And now, I'm having a flashback to another dining experience at the San Tan location where I was charged $16.99 for a \"double\" margarita.  Anyway, I am looking forward to the day when price won't be such an issue, but for the time being I will continue to really dislike getting ripped off!"}
{"text":"I come to this location often, love the food and service. Amiable servers and they check on you! I always leave happy!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for chain Mexican food....stick with Macayos.  I've gotten nothing but bad food here and bad indigestion. Food quality is poor and is on par with Taco Bell.  Just drive a little further to somewhere else."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday night at 7:45pm.  Place was half full, three hosts at the desk greeting my son and I.  We were put on a waitlist for a party of two, saying there were three parties ahead of us.  My son an I looked at each other thoroughly confused.  He then asked, how long, and one of the three informed us 20 minutes.  Huh?  Weekday, after dinner hour rush, clean empty tables - if a restaurant is short on staff to wait on tables or to cook, perhaps have your overstaffed host desk seat people, offer drinks and chips and salsa.  Would have waited an hour with a glass of wine and your bean dip.  Bad service model, Arriba.  Shame.  Went down the street, and gave my money to a business that wanted it."}
{"text":"I enjoy me some Mexican food. This may not be my favorite Mexican food place, but it's alright.   The rice and beans are pretty good. I have had a few things from the menu and so far my favorite is the Pollo Fundido (it's called something crazy on the menu) and it's pretty tasty.   Their lunch menu is great because the portions are just right and it's not that expensive, but it isn't really cheap.   Overall, it's alright."}
{"text":"Haven't been back in years. Why? Well, I eat just about any food and find something positive in everything. The food here,...terrible. Not just okay, actually tasted bad,....that's hard to do. I tried it twice, same experience both times."}
{"text":"One of those restaurants where the food should be good but we can't seem to order the right thing. It's either too spicy or too heavy. We will probably try again but we won't rush to do it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened. The prices have increased but the food remains as good as ever. Especially if you opt for one of the New Mexico inspired dishes. They are generous with the chips and always have two salsas and a delightfully spicy bean dip. I've always enjoyed the Chili Colorado, White Sands chimi and the Rio Grande Enchiladas. Recently as I've gone to lighter entrees, I've ordered the Roswell Chicken Tacos. Although I've had less than stellar service in the past, lately it's been fine."}
{"text":"If this New Mexico style restaurant was in New Mexico, it would not be open.Although it is not the worst place for Mexican food, it is easy to see why this is one of few places you dont have to wait for a table on busy nights.  Tonight our service was decent and the food was ok, just as expected. The hot salsa is way better than the mild and the bean dip is tasty with a spicy kick. I ordered the NM style red which was tasty but had no heat to it. I regret ordering the Margarita because it was too sweet and had zero tequila flavor. I can't stand when you pay for a Margarita and get triple sec over ice.  The total for five (3 kids and 2 adults) was $67 (not including tip) for the meal, 2 beers and a no tequila margarita. Our money could have probably been spent better elsewhere. The best part of the meal was not waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Only a Mexican food snob would undrmine such a great Traditional restaurant (and believe me we have plenty of those here in Arizona). This is old school Mexican food folks and it's about as good as it gets. The atmosphere is classic and I personally enjoyed it but it is not upscale  but then again Mexican food normally isn't. It's simple and that's what Arriba's is. If Arriba's were located in any Eastern state it would easily be the best in the entire state. The beans were great the salsa was delicious and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Their white sand burrito tastes like it was frozen in a freezer, then warmed up enough to serve. I decided to give Arribas the benefit of the doubt after my \"gross\" white sand burrito, and visit again. This time, my husband and I ordered the Mexican pizza (called Abodaba, or something?) I am not kidding... It made me want to vomit. I didn't want to make a fuss or anything because we were with a party of 10+ people. But, someone else in our party ordered a burrito with the same meat that we had on our pizza and said the meat was making her sick too. We told the waitress about it, and she brought out a different pizza, but with beef this time. I thought that was nice of the servers... except that by the time they brought out a new pizza, our party was ready to leave. We put it in a take-out box and finished the leftovers later. Regardless, I will not be visiting Arribas again and would discourage others from visiting too."}
{"text":"I liked, it was spicy, the beans and hot sauce they bring to u for dipping is so so so good, also order their mini chimichangas for appetizer, their margaritas for 2 is good shear with ur company ;-) from their menu i liked the chicken, steak fajitas also the white sand chimichanga its a bomb..."}
{"text":"Been dining here about a year and still trying diff things from the menu and all have been good. I don't think the heat is unedible even the hottest plates are just \"good\" hot."}
{"text":"Love the bean dip with the chips and salsa. No one does that and I think it is devine.  The margaritas are great, if you get them on the rocks. I wasn't a fan of the frozen banana margarita.  It did not have a lot of flavor.  The food is always good, always extremely hot, and always full of flavor.    I recommend you don't sit in the bar area.  It is noisy and you can hear every conversation going on in the kitchen (it would help if the staff were a tad more professional when they are in ear shot...I learned a few things about a few people there I didn't want to know)."}
{"text":"We often stop at Arriba after a Dbacks game, or anything downtown. The menu is huge and everything is delicious. My husband had a steak (carne asada), wanting a low carb option. I drank the huge 1800 margarita and it was yummy, not all ice like some restaurants will serve you! I had the mini chimis and they were greasy but good, very little filling, though. The rice and beans were good, but I would order the charro beans instead of the refried. The reason for 3 stars, the bathrooms.....not awful, but need a good scrubbing. The walls, floors, maybe even the ceiling....look like they need some attention.  I just had to wash my hands and left the bathroom wondering if maybe I was worse than before I went in."}
{"text":"Had Posole, bland and would not recommend! The happy hour margaritas were the sorriest I've ever had!. YUK! Waitress was nice,  chips were good, hot sauce- not good- no flavor."}
{"text":"This is my second review of Arriba Mexican Grill in Glendale and I'm sorry to say, this will be my last because I am not going to return to this place again.    Again, the stacked beef enchilada's were void of any flavor at all!  Although the food presented well, I mean, it looked good but my goodness, it was just terrible.  The bland meat was simply browned in a skillet without any flavoring at all and then shoved on to a corn tortilla and then covered with what was supposed to be red chili sauce.   There was supposed to be some of those world famous Hatch green chilies mixed in with the meat as well but again - zip, nothing.  When our waiter finally came by I asked for some chili on the side and a beer thinking I could salvage this mess but after a long long wait, still no chili and no beer.  Finally, my wife caught his eye and a few minutes later I had my request on the table but it was no use, this meal was dead.   What a disappointment.  I know this restaurant can make pretty good New Mexican food but something has changed at this store - either the manager is cutting corners by saving money on spices or she is just incompetent because this place is capable of better service and better food, I just haven't seen it in a long time.    What a disappointment.  I was anxious to leave this bad experience behind but it wasn't that easy.  No check.  Again, poor service - then at last, after about 15 minutes our AWOL waiter finally shows up with our check and we are at last able to leave our 1/2 eaten meals behind."}
{"text":"This is a great little place.  Very friendly staff and the food is always           spot on.  We've had both sit down and take out and have not been disappointed with either.  Portions are good with kids meals just the right size.  We don't live in AZ but when we visit, we come to Arriba."}
{"text":"I visited for lunch this past week. The customer service was just awful. There's no other way to say it.   My party and I got full on chips and salsa due to our food taking 40 minutes to prepare. When the server came to the table, she said their was a mishap with the bean dip. The way she said it caused us to be alarmed. Like was it burnt? Did a rodent fall in? What was it? Then we request no hot salsa and she brought it anyway.   The LAST thing for me was when I paid in cash. The server said that they ran out of change, \"it's just 30 cents you're short. Have a nice day.\" How is that okay? That 30 cents could have been used toward my bill at a better restaurant with better customer service.   Never again and NO tip was left. You get what you give."}
{"text":"The food here was okay, but there are definitely places close by that are better for lunch in North Scottsdale. The server that we had was awesome though. He helped us with recommendations, answered all of our \"first-time customer\" questions and even helped me add extra heat to my meal with a small bowl of green chiles. I love my ridiculously hot food and those hit the spot when I added them to the salsa and my burrito. Their lunch specials are a little bit higher priced than I thought they would be. Considering that Los Olivos is next door, I would probably head there first, but if you're looking for a similar restaurant and you like guero-fied Mexican food, this might be a spot for you."}
{"text":"Wow after going to ARRIBAS for the past 10 plus years and giving them several chances we are DONE  we used to go once a week or more but in the past few months food started to get worse,  \"spicy hot is not a flavor \" we have had from bad service to raw chicken and everything in between but today we had enough when the waiter took our food before we were done eating  WE WILL NEVER GO BACK TO ARRIBAS, it seems that the management don't know or don't care they can keep their bad food we are DONE"}
{"text":"Ok, first I want to say, this place is a must for out of towners. It's where the locals go to eat.  Second, the food here is always delicious and amazing but with that being said....  I went last night and the food was simply outstanding!!  You guys are outdoing yourself! Be careful with such excellent you guys set the bar high!   So, what do I recommend? The Hatch Chicken Especial; it's a green chile chicken with jalapeño cream cheese on top. Sooo fantastic, but it does have a kick! Also the White Sands Chimichanga with that delicious white queso smothering the entirety.   Third, the service is always friendly, I want to give a shout out to Logan for continued great service.   Fourth, they brew their own beer and have these giant margaritas!   So all in all, thanks arribas for being a staple in the area and Kudos for such a great job recently!"}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre at best. The frozen margaritas on happy hour won't even give you a slight buzz. I had the avocado chicken soup with sour cream. Sour cream was lumpy and smelled bad. Chicken tasted undercooked. The dos Equis was the best part about this place.. Oh and the waiter was super friendly and attentive. If I had to rate him alone I would give him 5 stars. 2 stars for the food and margaritas. 5 stars for the cold beer and waiter! Makes it a 3 star.."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite Mexican food places.  The fact that it's 2 seconds away from where I work is even better.    I think I've been coming here for a good solid 10 years now and every time i can be guaranteed a great Mexican meal.  The beandip with the chips is one of the main reasons i love to come here.  I don't think i've ever been dissapointed by a meal here and the staff is always super nice.  The owner walks around frequently and asks how your meal was on a regular basis.  Love this place and is my go to for mexican food anytime i have the craving!"}
{"text":"If you eat eggs, and they serve them at Arriba's, be sure that the waiter knows the difference between \"well done\" and \"over easy\".  You would think that would be an easy concept to understand.  No sir, not at this place.    Nothing turns my stomach more that seen runny yellow slimy eegs all over my plate.  It's just gross - I hate 'em and I thought that I made my waiter understand my distaste for anything but WELL DONE eggs - maybe it was a language thing, I'm not sure.  Oh, he offered to bring me a new order but honestly, my appetite was gone by then.  I did tell them that I would not pay for that stomach churning screw-up and he was OK with that but he did insist that I pay for my coke.  I didn't think I should have to considering that my WHOLE meal was ruined but I was glad to just get out of that place without throwing up."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food , not great. Service was good, some food came out cold had to send it back. I had the  chili Rellaeno it was real good very spicy!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually get the fajita quesadilla. They also have great guacamole. I've always had nice service and never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This is honestly the most unfortunate review I will have to write because the food is actually good. I went in for my birthday and we got there at 7:12. They seated us right away and then it was all down here from there. We had two get up 3 times throughout the night to find our server. Our margaritas came out 30 minutes late (1 was melted, so it had just been sitting there). Two out of the 7 people didn't get their food until 30 minutes after the rest of the table. The waiter didn't come back to check on us or do refills on anything. We told the manager and she gave the couple a free queso. It was the worst customer service experience. It took so long some people had to leave without finishing. We couldn't stay for dessert. If this place had good customer service it would have a wait on a Saturday night like all of the other restaurants in Gilbert. To be honest the manager should have taken over table at the point of grabbing here (we grabbed her after having to grab two other people that weren't out server so we could get service. )"}
{"text":"This was my first time in this restaurant.  The staff was really friendly. My meal was too spicy. There was too much pepper in the rice so I really couldn't really enjoy it. The margaritas were really good though!"}
{"text":"The White Sands Chimi is my regular favorite.  Best salsa in town but ask for the hot salsa which is my number one favorite.  Margaritas are great and HUGE.  Food is more New Mexican than Mexican.  It's spicy but excellent.  Ask for Raul.  He made us laugh and gave us great service.  Our favorite Mexican in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food, but the customer service for non-European Americans sucks. Tried to seat us as far away from the front as possible when the restaurant was almost empty. Did not even know there was a room that far in back of the dining area. Ordered a side item that never came which we were charged for. When we asked for the server to have the item removed from the bill the phoney acting hostess showed up saying our server was busy, even though we could see she was not.  As we finished our lunch the side showed up. We refused it and the server pointed to our almost empty plate to say some of the item was in the sauce.  May take a chance and return, but get the food to go and the hostess better not touch the order. Tried the location in Chandler and this server did not write anything down,  brought the wrong food, would  not remove the empty plates and was rude."}
{"text":"Maybe I do not have the most sophisticated palate, but I really liked my dinner here! Plus they were having $.99 margaritas. If you wanted to just live cheaply you could just have $.99 margaritas and chips and salsa and probably live the rest of your life.  all in all the service was good I am stuffed to the gills and I got very cheap tequila. What more can someone wants in life. I guess I am a very simple girl."}
{"text":"Service is really good at this restaurant but be careful when you order sides.  Every little side of guacamole or sour cream or extra lettuce and tomato will cost you.  I ordered the burrito lunch special which was $5.99.  The server asked me if I wanted guacamole and sour cream.  I said yes. When the bill came, I had been charged a dollar extra for each item.  My cheap burrito wasn't as cheap as I wanted it to be.  A dollar for a dollop of sour cream???  Give me a break...  One of my coworkers ordered extra lettuce and tomato, got charged 50 cents!  Iced tea was pricey too, $2.50.  We also got the cheese fundido.  $8.00 for a little skillet with melted cheese and jalapenos.  The food was good but I think that a little warning of if you want extras, be prepared to pay extra $$$.  There were three of us and we each paid $17.00 for lunch!  That's a bit much, Arriba Mexican Grill..."}
{"text":"Was like slop on a plate. I didnt expect it to be the best, ive had nm mexican a few times in nm. But this was very bland and was like slop. The green chilli cheese crisp was very good. But the beans were salty and the rice was dry. I wont be going back but its up to u if u want to waste ur money on slop and not go to ranosos traditional mexican food on ray and 50th by old madstone theater. Bean dip is good but runy cheap bastards."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to write a review and blast a company like this and to be fair, all the negatives come from their Gilbert location; the auwatukee location has always been good.  I've tried Ariba's several times and have been disappointed every time.  In the four of the last five visits, I've found the floors sticky and the tables dirty.  If they pay this little attention to the cleanliness of the front, I'm scared of what I might find in the kitchen.  Although I've always found the service to be slow and the waiters inattentive, Sunday's (8/5/12) experience was one of the worst I've ever experienced anywhere.  I thought I would take some out of town relatives to a good AZ Mexican dinner, but once we received our water/Ice tea, they were refilled once during our visit and that only after flagging down the waiter.  Minor, maybe, but when the food was delivered to the table, one of the meals was missing and I was assured it would be right out.  20 minutes later I flagged down the waiter once again and with apologizes, was told they would get it right out.  Another 20 minutes went by and my guests had all finished their meals before the waiter came by to see if we needed anything else. When I told him we still hadn't received the meal and since everyone else was done, we no longer wanted the meal and wanted it removed from our bill.  Again with apologies, he left and finally returned 20 minutes later with the meal removed.  Annoyed with the slow service I tried to return the bill with my credit card immediately.  I was ignored and waited another 20 minutes for him to return to take my money.  Save yourself a lot of aggravation and disappointment and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food looked exactly like the photograph and everything tasted great. From the bean dip to man course everything was both pleasing to the eye and pleasing to the belly.  The service was very good as well.  Definitely our go to place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Delicious! Green chile is spicy and flavorful ! Had the Carlsbad Chicken and it was bomb!! Salsa and Guacamole are a must!"}
{"text":"The only reason it did not get five stars, is because  I'm really tight with my stars!  Great place, very family-friendly, awesome food! Did I say awesome!? I meant to say AWESOME!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the taco plate and it was not bad. The chicken was extremely juicy and the shell was super crispy. The rice was fluffy and flavorful and the beans have a pleasant mild flavor. This retaurant has been in the Phoenix area for many years but I think this was the first time I've ever been here. I'd probably come back."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of 20+ people. Three of us ordered the street tacos/carnitas and all three of us had the exact same opinion. The meat had absolutely no flavor and was dry. The beans and rice were just ok, which to me is a bad sign. If something as simple as beans and rice aren't good then I have low expectations for the food. Everyone else seemed to really like what they got so maybe the tacos were a bad choice.   It should noted that our waitress was very patient and always had a smile on her face even though there were 7+ different checks and no one sat next to each other that was on the same check. I wish I got her name but she was working Saturday (3/11) night. We were in around 7:30/7:45 that night.   Decor is really beautiful and I liked the ambience. I would come back but would not order those tacos."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of this place. But I think the one on Camelback is the best location.   Last time we ate here the service was terrible and you could tell it was completely understaffed for a Sunday morning. My wife ordered a bloody Mary that was horrible and didn't have more than two sips. And on top of it all of our orders came out wrong.  Lastly, you could tell the staff was working their butts off and the manager on duty was standing around watching. In fact I saw someone dropped a fork on the floor and he stepped over it 4xs until the lady in a clown suit entertaining kids picked it up.  So for the price and what we got it was a waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all.  I like the little waterfall out front and wish they took advantage of it by having an outdoor patio around it.  99c margaritas for happy hour are great!  However paying almost $3 for a soda rounded out the pricing for beverages.  I liked the chips and salsa okay.  Was not a fan of the bean dip at all.  Ordered the guacamole.  Great amount and flavor was okay.  Didn't care for the big chunks of avocado that were stringy.  Can't imagine ever going back."}
{"text":"We are from NM and this is the closest thing we have found in AZ!  Love happy hour!  Half price appetizers and 99 cent margaritas!  Delicioso!!"}
{"text":"I went to Arriba for lunch with coworkers today. It was my first time dining there, and I will never go back. My coworker cut into her chimichanga to discover a huge piece of plastic (presumably some type of plastic wrap from food packaging). Our waitress got her a new chimi, but when the bill came, they didn't even comp it. The also charge extra for sour cream and guacamole, 99 cents and $1.99 each respectively AFTER what they said was half price. My lunch was a mediocre quesadilla that was over $13 after tax-- extremely overpriced for lunch and considering the quality of the food. This place gets a hard pass."}
{"text":"Come here to eat. The white sands chimi and the mini chimi app are amazing. The margaritas are enormous. I could eat here every day and die a happy, albeit overweight, woman. If you live far, drive. It's worth it. I promise."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for drinks one night and I dont know if it was just the bartender working at the time but we ordered two drinks and they were the strongest drinks we had ever had she put 15 shots in the drink and topped it off with Tea. $12 got us tipsy and the check. I would go back if I knew that bartender was working sure knew how to get a tip :)"}
{"text":"Awesome New Mexican food!! The hatch chilies are  fire! You can make ANY dish spicy by ordering some of the chilies! They give you chips, salsa, and a spicy bean dip while you wait for your food. Shared a nice big raspberry margarita for two ($10). They also brew their own beer ($4 for 16oz)! And it is good! The flaming chorizo queso is bomb and the presentation is cool. I ordered the white sand chimichanga which was delicious as well. My boyfriend got the 3 carne tacos. They were a little too burnt though. I won't deduct a star, although I contemplated it..My only complaint is that the service is SLOW. Good service, but takes way too long for everything. If you like spicy food, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. They serve chips with bean dip and salsa. Typically, bean dip is an okay thin for me, but I do especially like the bean dip here. It has great flavor and has a slight kick to it.  They have good lunch specials daily, and so far I've liked all of them.  Aside from the lunch specials, I've had the Carne Asada and Fajitas. Both were fabulous! I haven't veered from those yet because I love them too much.  The staff are pleasant and friendly. Today, the hostess seemed a little timid, but still pleasant.  I definitely recommend this place for excellent food at a reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I arranged a group of people to meet at this restaurant for dinner.  I arrived first, and went to the bar to have a drink while awaiting the others. I ordered a mug of domestic beer and handed my credit card to the bartender. I was absolutely shocked when she handed me the receipt to sign.  $4.85 for 12 oz of domestic beer?!!?  I immediately texted the others and told them we had a change of plans.  We went to another restaurant down the street where they appreciate customers and don't try treat us like suckers. ( I had a 16 oz micro brew for $3.50)  They lost out on a couple hundred dollars in business so they could hit me for nearly $5.00 for $0.50 worth of product.  I don't care how good their food is, I won't let any restaurant get away with gouging customers."}
{"text":"The food here is great!  I agree with those that believe the food here is good.  I've eaten Mexican food throughout Phoenix and this is one of the best.  I live in Southern California, and I can't find anything that compares.  I love the salsa and bean dip with chips.  The combination meals are great.  Their chimichangas and burritos are fantastic.  What I also love is that the portions are large, so I always have a midnight snack or breakfast for the next day.  Arriba!"}
{"text":"Arribas is a locally owned and operated Mexican-American food restaurant; no illegals here, so stay away Sheriff Joe.  Seriously, food is good, drinks are strong and reasonably priced, and usually they have a scary ass clown lady that will paint the mexican faces white, and the white faces Mexican!   It's a great place, and doesn't make me want to go all SB-1070. I thoroughly enjoy their enchiladas and burritos. It's a great place with a date or with a group. The staff is very diligent and polite and speak english as their first language."}
{"text":"Sorry..not much here I can give a plus to.. I do like the margaritas..so I can give a star or two.. I do love the chips...the little dips that you get prior to ordering...My one thing is that.. is that the dip crock is so small..that you have to continuously try and catch the waiter...I a bit of a chip muncher..salsa, and dip lover... So I have had the cheese crisp with a few extras on the side.. My parents were here and wanting some 'good ' mexican food... My mom, hated it... oops! Guess Ill pay attention to yelp before I do that again... I like that the food is New Mexican 'style' with green chile type dishes...but I have yet to be impressed with the enchiladas...or the tacos...or the food, in general. Service is blah..and inconsistent... starting from the moment you walk in to the 'dressed up' hostesses with attitude..but margs are good, strong..and the chips and salsas are good.. not great..good"}
{"text":"Super kind host!! Walked in, ordered food to go. Sounds simple enough but I so appreciate a welcoming smile, prompt help, small talk, and just good old customer service. Young employees these days dont understand how important the small things are. Good job young lady!!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch.  Service was great and the food was very good.  I had the green chili burro and it was one of the best I have had in PHX.  My wife had the chicken flower enchalada and she said it was very good.  Portions are large and the the free chips and salsa are a welcome addition.  The drinks could have used a bit more liquor.  Over all it is a great place and we will be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. The decor is classic Mexican restaurant but I like that. Huge margaritas. Good atmosphere. However, I feel bad because they are SO understaffed. 1 bartender who was also waiting on half the tables, one host guy running around. We had to wait 15 minutes for a table even though the place was empty. Then our server took 15 more minutes to come over. After that it was quick and our food was decent. I probably would not come back with other options in the area with better service."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this restaurant for years and have always enjoyed the food. But when a roach crawls on the table to join you for lunch it's time to say I'm not coming back. I know this is common in most restaurant kitchens but to have one on your table tells me these critters are aggressive and rampant at this place."}
{"text":"No bueno! The server was very very nice, can not complain about his attitude. I will complain about the food. Most of our food was warm when it should of been hot. I finished my Pepsi and after 15 minuets I took my plastic cup and walked around till I found the bar and asked for a refill, it was funny so I laughed my @ss off. Dinner came out and we needed a clean fork, never came so again got up and got one. It a Saturday the place was not busy. I say pass and keep on going."}
{"text":"First off I would like to recognize that my wife and I had great service but that's all that was great about or visit.  They claim to serve New Mexican food but the slop they serve is far from that.  My wife and I have both had stomach issues the entire night thanks to there poor quality of food."}
{"text":"Yuck! Fajitas bland (if you like lots of onions it's for you). Chicken tortilla soup had stale chips in there (not soggy but stale). No rice with the fajita plate. Bean dean was bland too.  Salsa not good unless you like a salty salsa. 2 stars was for friendly service and cute place."}
{"text":"Some consistency issues. There's times I have eaten at Arribas and it was 5 star service and food. Then others the bean dip is watery and the dishes are off flavor. It's a bit of a gamble."}
{"text":"Behold and Beware The Power of Mexican Chiles in Action  That was the theme of our first time here. MH ordered the Steak Tampico, marked as a 3 pepper dish. Seeing what followed with him was entirely new to me. If you can see a brown person turn red, you know it's hot.   His take: \"among the spiciest things I've ever eaten, better than sinus medication if you have a cold\". Hotter than the most diabolical chicken wings that we had together and needed 2 full pitchers of water with. Evidently the chiles in the red sauce which covered the bottom of the plate spread into the guacamole, the lettuce, the tomato, the olive ...  The white sauce on top performed the same function for the steak ...   Although he finished about half, which is usual. I wonder how long the effect will last and am monitoring the situation ...   Our server was friendly and attentive. The chips and salsas were filling. My chicken ? dish was fine. Didn't see why sour cream is an (expensive) extra. The flour tortillas on the side were ok, but bland. Nothing to compare with El Sol. The plates were cute, as they had the name of the restaurant  handwritten and fired into the various bright colors ...   The menu had photos, a little blurry but nice touch. Maybe it's just me but I'm not really fond of burritos and chimichangas swimming in sauce. Not that I got either this time, but if I do a special request would definitely be in order.   Overall, I don't think the quality of the food is worth the price. ok, but ordinary. I may go again, being married to a hot food junkie, but who knows - the effects of this particular mouth-burning may go deeper than I think. Time will tell ...   off to give him an acid pill :-)"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch with two co-workers. It's a darn good thing we weren't in a hurry because lunch took FOREVER. We sat at a booth in the bar area, the bartender came up pretty quickly to get our drink orders but didn't bring menus. I asked him if they had watermelon margaritas and his response was \"I don't think so\". So I asked if he could find out, his uncertainty immediately changed to \"nope, we don't have that flavor\". I ordered my drink, which was supposed to be a normal size, not the world's largest margarita. Oh well, what's a few more dollars, right? We sat without chips/salsa for quite sometime.  Our lunch took forever and when it finally came, I wasn't impressed. It was probably the worst taco salad I've ever had. The chicken was luke warm at best. It lacked flavor.  I had to ask for the guacamole I ordered when I ordered the salad.  My friend's burrito looked NOTHING like the photo. It looked like it had those kraft single serve cheese slices melted on top.   All and all. It's not worth coming back since I value my time and my taste buds.   The peach margarita was fantastic though."}
{"text":"Came in here after work for frozen margs and mini chimis!! Food is always delicious! The margaritas seem a little light handed on the pour and the mixed drinks are quite the opposite! God forbid you order a vodka pineapple because it comes out tasting like nail polish remover. (Stick to the beer and margaritas) Our server was James and he was outstanding! Super sweet and good service.. It's always slow here and I honestly wouldn't come here if it weren't so close to my work but it really is pretty good"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and got seated in the back corner booth with little nats flying around...  the floors were dirty... the restaurant was slow but the waitress kept coming over and apologizing for being so slow... we ordered drinks but the waitress said we were confusing... so we reordered... 23 margaritas and a root beer! The food was ok..."}
{"text":"This place needs to train their front reception counter and be better prepared for a crowd of 30 especially when advanced notification was given a week in advance, 3days and 1 hour prior to arrival. All three persons who took the call had no idea about a group coming even though the first \"manager\" said he would  put on the calender and let others know.Pass the chips and Salsa/Beans and keep them coming while we wait for our meals.  Fortunately ... their best asset was the sole waiter - James. HE DID A FANTANTIC JOB to.manage and serve the crowd. Definitely impressed with his skills and pleasant manner. This review 4-Star is for James!"}
{"text":"Arriba is alright. I haven't been to any other location, so I can't compare between Ahwatukee and elsewhere; but this location is adequate.  The Good: They actually have a pretty decent breakfast on the weekends; and you get a side of pancakes with breakfast too! The Queso dip is a tasty appetizer (it has chorrizo in it, mmm!). And the $.99 Happy Hour Margaritas are reason enough to visit Arriba.  The Not-So-Good: The service is pretty spotty. Sometimes you're waiting a while and the restaurant isn't even crowded. And I wouldn't say they're the friendliest group of people either -- not rude, but not friendly. The food is sort of uneven as well: some winners and some duds. And pay attention to the heat levels on the menu; some of the dishes are HOT.  Overall, Arriba is a decent middle-of-the-road Mexican dining option. I'll undoubtedly be back...for sure during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"The food here is always great but do yourself a favor and ask for Drew to serve you. She is amazing and has personality to spare. Be sure to ask for the real hot hot sauce since it had a real kick to it. The food is always spot on."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix with friends and wanted a more \"authentic\" style Mexican restaurant. When we walked in, we were greeted with several friendly faces and seated promptly.  Chips, salsa and a spicy bean dip was delivered with our drinks within minutes of sitting while we reviewed the menus. Descriptions and pictures were provided for each item to give customers a better idea of what they're ordering.  Portion sizes were good and the food was the perfect temperature (hot plate, so be careful). I had the cheese enchiladas with red sauce and a side of rice and beans. Great flavor and made just right.  Overall great service and food. I've been there a few times and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the chips and salsa. They chips are always so fresh, salsa is delicious and addicting. The bean dip is great too. I came here for lunch today and was very happy with the service and the food. I ordered a margarita and didn't like it much. I will try a different one next time. Everyone was so friendly and were attentive without making me feel rushed to leave. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The worst hostesses (your going to try and put a six year old in the bar??), compounded with surly and inattentive waiter + food not on par with their other locations. Big disappointment. This won't be a stop for us in the future and that stinks because I was so excited Arriba's opened a location on my side of town. I had the white sands chimi which has always been good, but there was no pork to the chili. Rice was like it was leftover and when my bean burrito loving little one wouldn't eat the \"yucky tortilla and spicy beans\", we were out."}
{"text":"Now I live in Glendale, AZ and within 2 miles of my condo, there are a 100 restaurants.    Arriba, \" eee chee wow wow what?\" was lined out the door with an hour wait and I don't know why, except maybe  all the lushes, are off work, drinking their double margaritas and getting behind the wheel to drive their kids home!  Hector, our waiter, took 30 minute intervals, in between getting a drink menu, getting us more chips and dip, taking our order, and never told me how much a side salad was after he said he would check...   We sat like Stooges, on a movie set, waiting for a pie in our face!!  The Chicken Carlsbad had too much creamy cheese, and got nauseating after awhile, my friend had an ok enchilada experience.  Hector never asked me if I wanted a drink, after he brought the menu."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are delicious and fresh chips, they also bring you bean dip as well that is pretty good.   Sat by the fountain and it was soothing out the cries of children thank god.  I had the chili verde and it was soooo good.  My only complaint would be I really love the green chili stew and when I ordered it I was told it was seasonal. Needs to be full time in my opinion"}
{"text":"Food was good, but hard to find anything not so spicy. This gringo does not like to have a mouth full of fire. Even something that was listed without any peppers (their measure of how hot, none being less hot, 4 being fire) I was hurting afterwards. Oh well, service was good and food was good otherwise."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a shoutout to our server Evan. He took amazing care of me. I came in for some soup because I wasn't feeling well. Initially I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and when he brought it out I knew right away that it wasn't what I was expecting. I apologized to him and told him I was hoping for something with more of a broth base because I was under the weather. He said \"the albondigas soup is broth based do you want to try it? If not I'll get you something else.\" He also went on to say that his mom wasn't feeling well either so he knew how I felt. It turns out the Albondigas soup was perfect! I ate about half of it. (Huge portion). He then said he'd put it in a to-go container \"and I'll add some more broth for you.\" It's the little things that count. Thank you Evan."}
{"text":"OOOOOOOHHHHHHHH...........now I see where the bad reviews come from.  I was here on Wed with my kids and had great service.........instead of BBQ on Labor day weekend we decided to come back here.......should of went with the BBQ  Sat in the bar..........took 15 min for someone to acknowledge us. We ordered.......Medelo Especial, Dos XX lager and a shot of Cabo Wabo tequila. We got.......get this........house margarita, Negro Medelo and a shot of some type of tequila (wasn't Cabo Wabo). We seriously had 5 different people serve us food, drinks, and check on us. My guess is it isn't the staff, they do not have a proper manager in this place. All the servers don't have a direction or structure. In my 2 times here this week, I have looked my servers in the eye and told them to make my food AS SPICY AS THEY CAN. What ever you have to make my mouth on fire, do it.....both times BLAH. My wife and daughter both had the tortilla soup this time, nothing to write home about.  Again I don't blame Alicia Silverstone our waitress, the entire bar seemed disorganized and clueless. We sat in the bar area and the bartender was behind the bar maybe 3-4 in the night.  If this place is here at Xmas time, I will be greatly surprised. Adios Arriba."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday around noon because they have a promotion where kids eat free. Before I talk about the food, I just want to say that all the staff was amazing. We had a great waiter and we were very happy with the service. I ordered the chicken fajitas. The chicken was really bland and seems to have been cooked independently of the veggies and just placed on top of them as they were brought out. I was not able to eat my food, it was really bland. The spicy bean dip that comes with the chips is really good though, but that is not enough to make me come back again. Kids were happy with the kid food, but the fries were not seasoned so I didn't think it was as good as it could have been."}
{"text":"Food is OK but wait times are HORRIBLE. Restaurant was only 1/4 full on a Friday evening (should have been a tipoff) but we still didn't have our food (all standard menu items) almost 45 minutes after ordering. Had to have it boxed up to go because we had only allowed an hour (foolish us!) to eat and had to be somewhere.  Arriba is a poor name, Manana is more fitting."}
{"text":"I am very mixed on this place. In some instances, I have had some great food and others, not so much. Here are some of the good instances:  -Queso Fundido dip is pretty tasty and taken above the typical velveeta dip that alot of restaurants offer -Arriba Taco Salad with shredded beef is actually  good and has a lot of veggies in it. I love the jalapeno ranch that comes with it. Its a pretty massive salad too! One of the less spicy items on their menu as well if you are not into spice -Mexican Pizza with shredded beef - Not bad but definitely not enough guac on it. Either order with extra guac or sour cream, or do as I did and order the queso fundido dip and dip the pizza in it  :O White Sands Chimi - Pretty good actually but extremely spicy for my taste. The husband loves this! -Flautas plate - Not too bad and definitely not spicy. They tend to give you lots of guac with this  :) -Chips, salsa, and bean dip - The chips, salsa and bean dip are decent. The only thing I would suggest is adding onion to the bean dip but then again, I am a total onion lover! The more onions, the better! -Arriba red sauce - This sauce has a good flavor. I like to get a side of it and pour it on my rice -Fried Ice cream with strawberries - By far my favorite item at Arriba!!! Everything else listed above has been good/ ok but nothing I would say is great. However, this fried ice cream is great! I LOVES IT and it might just be the best fried ice cream evar!  Here are the bad instances: -Chili Poblano - Too spicy to where you can't even tell what your tasting. I ordered this the first time I came and was not a happy camper. Don't let the one chili on the menu fool you, it should have 3! Granted, I am a wimp when it comes to spice but I can actually handle spice if there is a good flavor. This was just knock your eyes out of their sockets spicy and my stomach felt like crap afterward -Arriba sampler plate - Everything tasted crappy and old. Tamale was very dry -Shredded Beef tacos - Flavor of the meat is blah and the taco shell always seems to be soggy when I have ordered these. I love tacos but not these ones!  Now about the service, almost every time I have been here, the service is not very good especially when it comes getting more water. For a place that claims to be spicy, you would think they would automatically be bringing you water but they don't, you have to ask for it. Then apparently, you have to ask for refills because they never come back to refill it. I always dread that when I go to Arriba. They claim that they don't bring you water because of the current drought situation, however, look outside. There is a giant water debacle that runs morning, noon, and night! WTF?   I will say that they have a decent menu with many options and I love that there are pictures so you can see what everything will look like. That is the only reason I came back again after my first experience which was not pleasant. To sum it up, this place is simply ok in my book (except where fried ice cream is concerned, they make a glorious one!). However, you cant make a meal out of a fried ice cream. This is never one of the places that pops into my head to go to unless I want a sugar fix but I come here often since the hub likes it."}
{"text":"We've been happy with the food and service at this place.  We used to go to the one on Camelback years ago and loved the food there.  I like to order the Beef Flautas, but last night, I ordered a Chicken Chimichanga with rice and beans and chili verde sauce.  Very good with just enough spice.  My son had their chicken taco.  He couldn't finish the taco since the chicken had too much black pepper.  I know that he much rather have the usual quesadilla, but talked him into eating something different.  My husband had the Beef Enchilada with white cheese sauce.  I don't really know what authentic New Mexican food is, but this is one of our fave places to go.  Another New Mex restaurant we used to go to got a little pricey and the food went downhill...hate that!!!  They do have a  KID'S MEAL MENU."}
{"text":"The chicken fajitas were yummy. They gave me rice instead of the beans I asked for, but then gave me 2 orders of beans. The service was ok, but it was xmas eve and they seemed stressed."}
{"text":"This particular Arriba's is always dark. I have been here twice and the service is good, the chips are addictive and the food is yummy. Although I have never come during happy hour, I hear that there 99 cent margaritas are pretty good. I do know that their steak tacos and very well seasoned and delicious as well as their nachos. So if you are in the area, stop by and try during happy hour. Maybe one day I will finally make it. Also, turn on some lights!!! lol"}
{"text":"This place used to be great, now it is just ok.  The bean dip and spicy salsa is still here, as are the Margaritas and beer but something is just missing.  The spicy salsa is just not as bold or full of flavor.  The dishes seem tired and over done.  My chili rellno was good but a bit stringy and hard to cut.  The spinach enchiladas could have used a bit more spinach in them.   Over all still decent but for the prices I would rather go hit up another place."}
{"text":"Service was very slow sat at the table for over 10 minutes before we had a wait staff come over. The chip boy had to go get someone for us. Food took for ever to come out. We asked for our cheese crisp to come out first and it came out with our meal I told her that I asked for our cheese crisk to come out first all she said was do you still want it? We still wanted it she sat both our plates down and asked if we need anything else. We said no that was the time last time we saw her. When we went to eat the food it was barely warm the plates were not even hot. We waited trying have her take them back for hit fresh ones but we never say her. Our drinks are empty we asked for someone to get our waitress it was another 5-10 minutes by this time we did go ahead and eat the cold food because we had movie tickets and had no clue how long it would take since it took over 40 minutes to get our food the first time and we had to ask outer staff to fill out drinks. Asked for manager but was told it would be a few minutes that he was helping in the kitchen. So we just left the cash on table and walked out."}
{"text":"Order the Margarita!  Just make sure that you don't have anything to do after.  Fresh chips, salsa, and spicy bean dip to start, nice and greasy mexican pizza with shredded beef to finish.  Had to go home and sleep after this one.  While it may not be the cheapest, the huge portions and stiff drinks will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I went on recommendation. Walked in noticed kind of musty smell, should have left. Everyone  there probably  doesn't  notice. Server was friendly. Ordered  food ,taco salad and quesadilla both chicken. Chicken  very bland, Taco bell has more flavor. Need to fix wobbly  tables and wipe down greasy  menus. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, sub-par food can be forgiven if the service is decent. When a restaurant is nearly empty and servers are standing around, there is no excuse for bad service. Our drinks were not refilled once, dirty dinner plates and long finished appetizers were on the table when we left, after dessert. The thin, dark haired manager (if that's what they call him), is the worst!!! Managers are there to smooth out situations, he made ours worse. He was uncaring and argumentative, then stood at the door smirking at me. Do they hate their customers? That's what it seems like."}
{"text":"This place is horrible I ordered a party platter and I go to pick it up and manager throws it on the counter with No Salsa No chips No guacamole I asked him where's the rest of it and he's like is Extra when I usually order a $5 burrito I get chips and Salsa but When I order a $50 Platter he says is Extra so I don't know if he gets Commission on Salsa but is terrible Customer Service this Manager provided... Don't go to Arribas. Macayos treats you better"}
{"text":"Great food, short waits. Good service. For dinner try the white sands chimi, has a nice kick to it. For lunch try the specials, you'll get a drink, chips, salsa, and the special all for $7!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is lovely as it is colorfully decorated with an assortman of cultured decor. There are multiple seating options available in different rooms. It is definitely much larger than it appears from the outside.   It also gets busy quickly so try to get there before 5pm. Ample free parking on side and rear of restaurant.   Service was appropriate for the size of the restaurant. They have happy hour with $1.99 house margaritas that are moderately sized and appropriately prepared (not too sour).   Food is good. Tortilla chips were served with beans and salsa. Tortilla chips appeared to be freshly made. Beans and rice had an even texture, consistency and taste; however the beans served with the tortilla chips had a bit of spice to them.   Service was great."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Service was way slow, waitress was I in another world, tells in salsa and drinks took forever.  I order the fish tacos, asked for sour cream instead of the spicy sauce they use. First off, there was so much sour cream, the disk was literally swimming in it. The amount of fish was ridiculous for the price of the meal ($11), I wish I had taken a photo of it.  It wasn't seasoned and had no taste.  Oh, and the ice tea was nasty.  Manager gave us a free appetizer for our next visit but we went be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here since we've elected our first Black president  in office. Food is always excellent, fresh, and appealing. Not sure what all of the negative comments are, but this is my favorite Mexican restaurant. The lunch specials are to die for. And is the valley's best-kept secret. Where else in the country can you order a full meal - complete with entree, rice and beans - for a mere $4.99...nowhere !!  Throw-in the unlimited warm bowl of chips and salsa/bean dip and you're in Heaven.   Alvin, the manager is always kind and friendly, and greets us whenever we are there 3x/wk. We're always the only Asian couple there, yet we prefer Mexican over Chinese due to the immense cooking oils and MSG preservatives used in Asian cooking. And Arriba's gives you large portions so we're always satisfied and full when we leave.   Arriba's is always open and receptive to our requests; such as to customize our order so  that there is less cheese or is completely substituted for healthier black beans;  or the chimichanga converted as a fresh burrito instead of it deep-fried. etc....we love it !!  It's a healthy alternative.   Thanks Arriba's for being an asset to the community. And for continuous loyalty in satisfying our palate with all the love and flavors of Old Mexico."}
{"text":"This is pretty good Mexican Food at a low price.  I really like the \"free\" bean dip and the Chimichanga (Mini & Regular).  The margaritas are good too, but the service is usually average.  The location is in a great are, but the parking is somewhat limited If you are looking for a inexpensive dinner that is pretty good than this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Love love love it!  Walking distance from my hotel, nicest staff ever, best happy hour!  The mini chimis with jalapeno cream cheese were excellent.  My waiter John (5 pm on Monday) was awesome!  The bill for it all was hilarious, what with the 99 cent Margaritas!    Thanks for a great time from someone visiting from Seattle with a foot cast on!  Lovely patio and fountains!"}
{"text":"First let me just say, Arriba's is definitely under rated! Their food has always been good every time I go and their menu has a lot of variety with a picture for every item! What always brings me back though is their BOMB.COM bean dip that has a little spice! It is soooo good!! The only reason I gave them four instead five stars is because they could work on their customer service. Besides that, the restaurant is decorated really cool and their food is delicious!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Best service I've had in Phoenix in a while. Fernando was friendly and very hospitable. There's a $4.99 Thursday lunch special - Chicken Chimichanga. I got it with red sauce, rice and beans.  yass!! Not spicy (I love spicy though), good texture; could be a little crispier, but still a great value. My Corona ($5.25) was served with a perfectly frosted mug and wedge of lime. I was greeted promptly and checked up on periodically. The chips served with bean dip and salsa was fantastic. I'll definitely come back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"First, let me clarify that what I am about to describe, is not representative of the typical experience I've enjoyed at any of the various Arriba's locations I have dined at previously.  Over the weekend, my girlfriend and I stopped in the Goodyear Arriba's for dinner. We weren't particularly hungry due to the heat. Unfortunately, the service we received in the bar practically made it a realistic possibility that we weren't going to eat.  We arrived at dinner time, around 6, and there was a small wait. There appeared to be a few parties ahead of us waiting outside. We bypassed that and headed to the bar. We got the last two bar stools, but it wasn't particularly busy in this part of the restaurant. I didn't get the name of the male bartender, and that's probably a good thing for him. All he did was get us chips and salsa and our beers. After that, he was A.W.O.L.  Thankfully, we enjoyed our cervezas (the house amber). And the Carne Asada Tacos we shared were good. But even the female bartender who got us menus and took our order was a little off. Eventually, she closed our check and we left with a little bit of a bad taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"We were a regular customer of theirs and we decided to dine there on Cinco de Mayo.  What a mistake!   We waited in the bar and my husband has a really bad hip, so he sat down at one of the standup tables in the bar and I just stood.  Someone came by and said we could sit there and I asked them to take my name off the list to be sitted then.  The manager came by and rudely asked us to move as he was seating someone here.  It was embarrassing!  We did not ask to sit there and we knew the tables were for the people on the list.  The girl said just sit down, which we did!  We won't be going back as we were at the hightop table for a good 25 min anyway, so if they wanted to seat someone there, they sure took their time in doing so."}
{"text":"Great service, Festive decor, Hospitable, Great flavors! Very busy and happening place! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Arriba is one of our all time favorite restaurants to frequent. We have never been disappointed leaving until today. We decided to stop for lunch as we were in the area. We were seated quickly, which is typical. I used the restroom before our waitress got to the table and my husband ordered our drinks. When I returned he went to the restroom and our waitress brought the drinks out. She was incredibly cold towards me as she placed our drinks on the table and said she would be back to take our order. When she returned to take our order she was very short and I couldn't finish before she turned to my husband and asked what he wanted. Then she collected our menus and walked away. While we waited for our food, there were tables around us our waitress was working. She was bouncing around and just as cold to the other tables. Our food was brought out pretty much thrown on the table and she walked away. Not ONE time did our waitress stop and ask us how our food was. Not ONE time did she stop and fill up our water glasses or ask my husband if he wanted another beer. She was at the other tables around us. This was around 1pm so even at lunch it was not busy at all. If this was my first time eating at this establishment I would NEVER return. As this is our multiple time being at this establishment I honestly do not think I will return. The food was different today and not how it usually is. The service was subpar than what we usually get when we are there. No one seemed friendly. I don't know if the waitress was having a horrible day or not, but as a paying customer I expect a little more. If we had been difficult or rude upon arrival I can't complain about how cold and rude the waitress was, but we weren't. She made it crystal clear she didn't like us as she never returned to our table. Even putting the check down and clearing our plates she NEVER asked how the food was. We paid our bill and walked out. I called to speak to a manager and I tried for over 40 minutes to call and it was busy. I tried other Arriba restaurants and it rang right away so I'm not sure what the Goodyear restaurant was doing."}
{"text":"Service at this location is just the worst. I don't know if they are understaffed or just non caring. Food had been super inconsistent the last 3 times I've been here. Some days the beans look like they were scooped out of a can that's been left open 3 days. The Queso Fundido Is the only reason we go back. And if you can hail down a server the $1 margaritas during happy hour are good. The last time I went the place was nearly empty and it took 40 minutes for my order to come out. And when it had it was burnt. If you want Arribas go to the ahwautuki location."}
{"text":"Where do I begin... this was a very bad experience first of all A/C was not working. They gave us 2 appetizers on the house for the inconvenience.  We were a large party of 17 I had a taco salad it was not good at all the lettuce was chunks and meat was canned i tried to eat it but couldn't. We asked to split the check and was told it could only be split in 1/2 but no more. The waitress agrees to split the check in 3 because they where not busy. Waitresses sadly must have been having a bad day because as we walked out she was on the phone and appeared to be crying. Hopefully this place improves I could see it closing its doors soon."}
{"text":"Good for what it is - cheap tex mex.  Well priced happy hour deals and the mini chimis keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I feel bad saying it, but we went here on Christmas day because we're new to the area, our families are on the east coast, and we didn't feel like cooking a holiday meal for just 2 people.  Our first good sign was that the place was slammed.  Even still, we were greeted by a friendly staff and seated quickly despite how busy they were.    We were shortly served crisp chips and both salsa and a spicy bean dip.  We narrowed down to a few choices from their large menu, and took some advice from the waitress.  Our drinks came shortly after, and before long we had our food.  The food was hot and fresh, and delicious.  By far, our favorite Mexican restaurant yet.  We've tried several over the 9 months we've lived here, and while most were just ok, we actually enjoyed the food here.  The dining area was fairly large, and is colored brightly with a tropical theme.  The bathrooms were clean, and the sinks had a really cool fish design.  Kind of a weird thing to comment on, I know, but I felt it worth mentioning.  Overall we had a very good experience here, and I am definitely looking forward to going back and trying more dishes from their huge menu."}
{"text":"Food always good ,that's  not the problem , the service is always so slow .we come in at least 1 a month it doesn't matter the time of day , mid day.  ,lunch , dinner ,all the same , today we even had to physically walk and ask our waiter for more chips , salsa , and drinks .and it wasn't even busy , he cashed out tables .. Lol.. Maybe just  laid back attitude , not sure  After food was delivered by someone else after did  our waiter  only came back When both our food was almost gone ,thankful we didn't have problems with it ,  The place is clean , walking in always a hi , get seated right away , big enough place that you don't have to wait long  but just the service  We continue to come back only because of the good  good,hopefully someone reads these"}
{"text":"Loved everything we tried! The queso fundido was hands down the best I have ever had! My plate was perfectly spicy. Highly recommend it! Family friendly and exceptional customer service!"}
{"text":"They give you bean dip with your chips and salsa here and sometimes that is the only reason why I choose to eat here. I heart chips and salsa! I have never had a bad meal here and the fish tacos are really good. After looking at all the other reviews I am obviously the minority when I say I heart Arriba!"}
{"text":"I love it. I love their food, so much, that I'm willing to overlook the poor service and sometimes funny findings in the food.  I love their food.  It is very spicy, and I loveeeeeeeeee spicy. So if you and your family/friends don't enjoy the spicy, look elsewhere.  The fundido sauce is to die for.  I love their roasted hatch chiles. Love it."}
{"text":"Was volunteering at a function nearby, so the wife and I stopped by for lunch. Their food was OK, service was fine, and the location was clean.  I had the chicken quesadilla, it was good nothing special about it. I have had better tasting elsewhere. The wife had their ground beef tacos. She was satisfied. I'm not really bashing the place. Because it was a decent place. But again, there are other restaurants that are much better."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food ever. Nothing is fresh, most everything they serve tastes like literally coming out of a can."}
{"text":"Food sucks! And they charged guacamole which was not asked for! Absurd and a thief of a business! Close down now!"}
{"text":"As long as I live I will never go back to this dump again. On our most recent visit (yesterday) as usual the service was incredibly slow and the bathroom and restaurant were very dirty but this is not what I am reviewing. I am strictly going to speak of our meals which were a travesty. Both my husbands and my meal finally reached our table 30 minutes after we ordered, both were cold. The waiter notified Erika (lackluster manager) and she insisted on bringing me a new plate. What came out was even worse, I pulled a long black hair out of my enchiladas. Erika argued that it was a \"scallion\" until I pulled the entire hair out and she just said she would remove the charge from our bill. Her attitude was completely dismissive and unprofessional. She tried to imply that I had placed my own hair on the plate which I find appalling. This restaurant has been going down hill for quite some time and with the service and attitudes like we experienced yesterday I can't imagine them staying open for much longer."}
{"text":"Arriba has been one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, but tonight I have really had to examine my love of this restaurant. It has been at least 6 months since I ate there and I was really excited about going back. I was seated in the back room. I immediately noticed that it looked like it needed a deep cleaning. My table was clean, but the walls and the areas surrounding the cheesy nature scenes in the back were filthy. The service was good, and my meal came quickly. As I was eating, something caught my eye not far from my table in the nature scene plants. It was a set mousetrap. This really turned my stomach. The food that I was eating was great as usual, but it really creeped me out that the place was so dirty and that they apparently had a rodent problem. My advice to the owners is to bring in a professional cleaning team and for heaven's sake don't leave mousetraps out for the patrons to see."}
{"text":"This is a classic American Mexican food place. It leans slightly toward New Mexico style. They have a little bar area which is sad because if the bar was bigger they would do so much more business at happy hour. The menu was extensive and not the easiest to navigate partly because it was sticky (gross). Our waiter was attentive and the place felt clean and tidy. We got two large margaritas which were very tasty and not too tangy. Food arrived in a timely manner and the food was just, average. I'm giving 3 stars because of their happy hour. Great prices and cheap decent appetizers. Secondly they are a microbrewery. This would be a hopping place if they catered less to the dining room and more to the bar. Just sayin...."}
{"text":"The only way I would ever eat here again is if.....   1. Every restaurant in the world has closed except Arriba  2. I died and was reincarnated with no taste buds  3. I'd just smoked some chronic and had already finished off all the moldy stuff in my fridge  4. I was a rat.  5. I was a cockroach.  5a. I was a  rat who'd eaten a cockroach and wanted to get the taste out of its         mouth.  6. I was King or Emperor or something, wielding enough power to have the head chef tortured if he fucked up my meal.  7. Roadkill no longer existed.  8. There was a nuclear holocaust and for some strange reason, this was the only      place left standing.  9. I'd just been released from a mental hospital. 10. My in-laws were visiting from the east coast and wanted to 'try some really good Mexican'. 11. I lost a bet. 12. I needed to get out going to church, blaming  'food poisoning' as the culprit. 13. I'd just landed the role of surly waiter in a major Hollywood film, and needed to        practice the part by understudying the real thing. 14. I was into philanthropy and accustomed to the idea of throwing money away. 15. I was on my deathbed, and my family refused to honor my living will by not       pulling the plug on me. I'd ask them to take me here for one more meal where I'd       die on the spot.  My waiter was a major sphincter, telling us about the happy hour Margarita for 4.99 when a moment later, he informed the couple in the next booth of their 'famous' 99 cent margarita. I want my four bucks back.  When I ordered the taco salad for 9.99, trying to be helpful, he suggested I order the salad on the next page..the one for 11.99. I did. It came with cold chicken tasting as though it had been boiled. The lettuce was layered with gobs of sour cream and featured rust spots. I ate about two bites before sending it back.   Arriba, between its sphinct-o-waiter and the god-awful, overpriced food, was so bad, if I had to compare it with shit, shit would win.   Even some rare form of shit only found on the bottom of the ocean, left there by some deep sea creature who's never been photographed.   Please tell all your snowbird friends about this place."}
{"text":"The service was good and wife and I loved the chips and queso (although queso was a bit spicy for her).  She order beef taco special and I had ground beef chimy.  The beef had NO FLAVOR!  And, I mean NONE.  Most under seasoned meat we have ever tasted.  As well, wife ordered Cheese Enchilada, a-la-carte.  Enchilada was very small and was almost $7.00, a full $1.00 more than her entire lunch.  Once again, service very good, some aspects of food good, but when the heart of the dishes taste like boring cardboard, it is tough.  Enchilada WAY over priced, the rest was reasonably priced.  Would go back again, and it will be last chance.  Hire a cook that knows seasoning and can apply it.  Under seasoned Mexican food is a crime on every level."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  I had the pollo con queso and my sister had pollo al diablo very flavorful."}
{"text":"I admit to being surprised by the tepid reviews here!   After getting jerked around by a few other local places who didn't have the capacity but still wanted to _eventually_ sell us dinner (after we'd paid for a lot of drinks at the bar while we waited) we ended up at Arriba and we had a lovely dinner this past Saturday night (while the big ASU football game was going on).  They seated us in less time than they said it would take to get a table.   Drinks order was taken and filled quickly and with pleasant welcome.   We made a somewhat complex food order and everything came out correctly.   The \"hatch style\" fajitas are fantastic as is the queso fundido starter.   They have a big menu, I suspect it comes down to knowing what to order and what to avoid."}
{"text":"This Ariba location is not the best option for Mexican food but it's fairly cheap (~$11 dinner plates) and the servers are consistently friendly.   I like that they are open late on Sundays and have decently fast service."}
{"text":"Don't do it. My girlfriend and I were there last night and sat near the kitchen area in the back. Our water was great, very friendly and attentive. However, while waiting we could see the other waiters just standing there and one of them (dark skin and a flat top haircut) picked his nose! When our drink (a large raspberry margarita for two with no trace of alcohol in it) and our food it all looked good. So we ate and then as we got ready to leave a small roach ran from underneath the table to the top of the table.  Luckily my girlfriend didn't see it. As we walked out I told the manager. I'll never eat there again."}
{"text":"this place deserves more stars just with the bean dip... its a spicier flavorful dip to get your tastebuds ready for whats to come. ive ordered about 5 different things from here and the food has always been good... some days better than others, but always tasty and flavorful. ive only tried the beer they brew themselves once and it tasted a bit older and not as carbonated as a crispy beer should taste so i wouldnt say their beer is the greatest, but the food speaks for itself. the menu also includes an image for each dish so it makes it a lot easier to picture what youre gnna grub.   today, i ordered the hatch green chile relleno with machaca beef and got a tortilla on the side... had good flavor, spice and overall 3/3 nom's. gnna try the red corn pork taquitos next time w/ chzy fundido sauce for sure. they also have a good ice cream egg roll type dessert. nomnomnom!!"}
{"text":"This place definitely isn't great food by any means but it wasn't terrible either. The chips & salsa are standard with the mild being ok. But the best part of that little starter is the bean dip! I ate two of them on my own - that good! Our server also used the dip as a reference for spice level of the meals which I thought was a great idea and was much appreciated. :)  My actual meal really wasn't good. I ordered from the brunch menu and got something like southwest... blah.. blah (I really can't remember!!) and I ordered the eggs over easy but when they came they were over hard so I asked for them to be remade which the server did very politely and apologized for the mistake. I didn't feel like my food was going to be spit in, ha! But the eggs, when they first came to me, had onions & cilantro on them but when they brought the remake it was just plain eggs which isn't any reason to lose a star but I simply thought it was strange they came plain. Aside from that, the meal I had just wasn't good. It looked good, smelled good, but just didn't deliver. :(   Now for the server. His name was Andrew (I think!) and he was the BEST server I've EVER had I think. He was attentive, talkative (but not overly or annoying), and he sang happy birthday to the table across from us and made it humorous. I don't think the food would draw me back here but it's worth trying again because the service was so perfect. I'll give it another try eventually!   Overall: Great staff. Great bean-dip. Eh brunch."}
{"text":"OMG! The margaritas are the size of your head. Too bad they're not legally allowed to doggycup the margaritas cause you can't finish it all.   Check out their weekday daily specials. They have 99 cent tacos.   You have to wait awhile to get in. Thankfully, the outdoor fish pond helps to mesmorize you while you wait. Parking is tight."}
{"text":"My husband & I have nicknamed this place Dogfood Cantina & only go here when we are forced to for a family members birthday dinner. Whatever you do dont get the Machaca, or as my husband calls it the Macacka. It litterally tastes like dog food that had been frozen then thawed in a microwave. We were also informed by a former employee that the site & smell of the kitchen will make you never want to eat there again. We're hoping our latest family members birthday dinner there will have the whole family convinced to never choose it again for their birthdays!!!"}
{"text":"Gave it another shot after 10 months, the service sucked then and it hasn't changed since apparently. Rude bartender,  wait, wait, wait for everything. What a shame, they have good food and a decent atmosphere.  This place needs new management who will clean house and hold the employees accountable."}
{"text":"Very salty. Service was slow. Food mediocre at best and if they ask if you want dollop of guac and sour cream be prepared to pay 4.00 on you bill.  That should be standard on a 14.00 plate of food."}
{"text":"Food was good but halfway thru our meal waitress brought out a big mop and bucket and not once but twice mopped the floors in our small section. I could smell the cleaning solution and view the wet floor and the bucket sitting against the wall near our table. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Not So Good... Half star ...   What can I say about Arribas Mexican Grill. Let's start on a positive note.  The staff is warm, friendly, and extremely personable, which is why I feel horrible for saying their Mexican Food is bland and tasteless.   I really wanted to like Arribas Mexican Grill. After all I had been to the Phoenix location and the food wasn't bad. However, the way to begin a meal is not with a watery tomato salsa and a puny bowl of broken chips.   I have to give Arribas props for their cheese crisp. The cheese crisp was loaded with cheese and extra crispy. However, the enchiladas were soggy and brunt on the ends. Followed by  the overcooked rice and flavorless refried beans.  Not the worst Mexican food on earth, but it is a contender."}
{"text":"Bland, Bland, Bland! I went in by myself and sat at the bar. I ordered a plate. I asked for hot sauce and they brought me diced tomatoes. The food had zero flavor......i mean none!!!! Amazed they stay open."}
{"text":"I've been reading the reviews and was a little confused by the negative reviews. I usually don't write reviews but thought I must on this one.  I've eaten at the north locations and was so glad when we got a branch in the west valley. My son introduced me to this restaurant and it has never let me down.  I ordered take out for all of my family when they were here for funeral services for Mom. There were no complaints on the food, presentation was good, it was Friday night but we did not have to wait long and I was not disappointed at all in the food. I just purchased entrees to go and the service was good. I know it was take out but I had to travel almost an hour on my way home and asked them to cook it at a specific time so everything was fresh. Their server even called me with a question about the order and brought me a water to go when I left. Very respectful and I received everything I asked for and it was very good.  Thanks for putting an Arriba's in our area. I don't eat out much but will be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice. 99 cent margaritas are standard and what you'd expect. Food is also standard. Price is right for the food."}
{"text":"Busy but always good food! Service friendly and quock with the amount of people. Recomend the white sands chimichangas."}
{"text":"Will not be returning to this restaurant! Very limited seating on a weeknight, only high top tables available and the temperature was at about 70-75 degrees which is pretty cold for a restaurant.  Waited about 40 minutes for 2 burritos,  the food was good but nothing special.  We got the bill and it came out to $40 of which $9 was for guacamole and sour cream that we didn't even ask for.  The waiter asked if we wanted it but didn't tell us it was extra!  $4 for 2 tiny scoops of sour cream and $5 for 2 smalls scoops of guac.  This is a total scam in my opinion!  I'm normally a very good tipper but after paying $9 for something that should be free I gave him a basic tip and will not be returning to this place.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Last time I was here probably five or six years back? Saw they have a sign out they have Street Tacos for lunch special. I never try Street taco before I always order other stuff when in a Mexican restaurant. I am glad I tried. It was pork topped with chopped onions and tomatoes and with some lime juice...hmmm...yum yum. Try to avoid lunch rush hour tho or there will be wait."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place bc a friend of ours told us to hit it up, but at every turn it just fell flat. We came in at 3:40 p.m. and upon arriving was told \"let me check for seating,\" which was ironic since there was all of about 15 ppl there in a fairly large restaurant. I mean I kind of chuckled when it was beyond apparent they could of sat a bus of ppl due to the vacancies. Once we sat down, we were put WAY in the back, it took 12 minutes (yes I checked my phone) to have our waiter find us. Come on, 12 flipping minutes to be greeted with water?? At least we had plenty of time to figure out what we wanted so we ordered right away. Our waiter was super friendly and courteous. He was one of the few bright spots. We ordered and then got lost in translation again. One would of thought it was packed and there was a huge party or something bc the service sure seemed like it. I believe our server was probably the only one working, but there were plenty of staff standing around.   The only truly friendly staff was our waiter and the host that smiled on our way out. haha. The food was good but the pricing seemed a bit off compared to the food and sure as hell the service didnt reflect it. Would I recommend this place? Probably not unless you hit up their happy hour or maybe take out. Maybe some more training or something. My wife and I are not difficult to please, but good hell."}
{"text":"On the plus side: service was excellent and the chips/salsa, bean dip and guacamole was good.  On the opportunity for improvement side: The interior is cheesy, and the food was uninspiring. It's almost as if they served warmed over frozen meals. The margarita I had was expensive and smacked of sugary syrup. My chicken tacos were greasy and sort of bland. My husband's chimichanga was nothing special.  As another reviewer mentioned: there are so many other alternatives for Mexican food in Gilbert, why come here?"}
{"text":"Too bad the bartenders are total assholes here because their pozole is so fucking good."}
{"text":"My husband and I always love this place.  We've catered from here for Superbowl events as well as gone to lunch and happy hour.  We also picked up some fresh roasted hatch chilis when they have them out front during promotional times.  They were amazing and we made some great dishes at home!  Our favorite is the pollo con queso, but there are so many good menu items.  We often get the pollo con queso and something else to share so that we can try something new as well.    We just went there tonight because Sundays kids eat free and that is just great!   Their patio is awesome because it has an indoor/outdoor feel and is backed by a waterfall for some sound ambiance!    Great salsa, great food, great with kids, I love this place!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I go here whenever she's in town.  I like this place a lot and for their price their portions are enormous.  I've often heard other say they have long wait times of 30 mins or so, but my cousin and I have tended to be pretty lucky in the sense that we're always seated the moment we walk in.  I don't recall ever waiting once.  Then again it's always the two of us, I'm sure if we had a big party it would be a longer wait.  And we're also always willing to sit next to the bar or at the bar if it means getting seated faster. Sitting at the bar and eating my food isn't going to kill me, it's not the end of the world.  You can still see the person next to you and hear them talk.  I'd suggesting calling by phone and making reservations before leaving your house to drive there.  If the average wait time I see for larger parties is 30 minutes and it takes you 30 minutes to get there, then it should work out just perfectly.  I see a lot of negative reviews on here, which it's been 4 months since I've been here but I'm surprised if it went down hill that quickly.  For now I'll still say I'll go back when my cousin is in town next month.  Perhaps I'll update my rating then."}
{"text":"This rating is for the beer they make here. I was disappointed when I went to the location on Camelback and it was the only one that didn't have a microbrewery. The time I came here and got the microbrew, it tasted so fresh and tasty. The thing I like about this place is the beer they make."}
{"text":"This place deserves a minus star, however, Yelp doesn't provide a score lower than ONE.    The food is mediocre, the service is the worst I've ever seen!  When the waiter/server screws up your order, they blame YOU and in so many words call you a liar for their mistake.    Don't bother calling the manager - he has NO Customer Skills whatsoever!  I'd rather eat at Taco Bell than to eat at this location!  In the event Arriba decides to relocate the manager at this location, beware!  The manager's last name begins with a \"G\" (in case Yelp doesn't allow publication of names)."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place, and were completely disappointed. The food was the worst Mexican we have ever eaten! My husband had chili colorado, that was dried up beef chunks in a bland sauce that tasted like canned chili. I had fish tacos that were flavorless, and the fish was undercooked and tough. The waiter never even bothered to ask how our food was. We will never go back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"Favorites here are:  Hatch chicken Especial; White Sands Chimichanga and most of the daily lunch specials.  Nice place and the food is always the same consistent quality -- good but not fantastically spectacular -- but then again that isn't a bad thing over the years. Ditto for the margaritas.  Recent visit the food was as expected but as mentioned by others below, the place needs a good cleaning!  Sometimes a mop and a few rags just isn't enough.  I'll still stop though for lunch whenever I'm in the neighborhood and don't want to deal with the 24th/Camelback crowd."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places for a flavor of a Mexican meal with the best cheese sauce ever. The green Chile on anything is delicious plus can't beat the $0.99 margaritas after three. The service is prompt and the food taste great. The atmosphere is lively yet personable. I love coming here."}
{"text":"What can i say but i will never come here again. I decided that this would be a great place to take my grandmother of 87 yrs we got her the grilled chicken and it was burned so we asked for a new one and received not only a new one but also a side of bad service. The next day i thought why not give them another try but it was even worst they told my uncle that they didn't cary a drink that he had just ordered yesterday. What the f....really. Not only was my food cold but they messed up the order. My mother didn't get the enchiladas that she had asked for and my grandmother got some without cheese. For me its all about the service and all i can say is it was bad. Needless to say we complained to management but it fell on deaf ears and instead they huddled a couple of steps away and talked about our table really are we in kindergarten. We decided the best thing i could do is pay the bill and warn everyone to go somewhere else. If your tring to have a nice evening with your family DON'T got to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good New Mexican food. Solid appetizers even chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner during happy hour.  Fantastic service by Michael and his manager Francesco came over to chat with us as well. We had them running for drinks and appetizers.  Been there 5+ times and never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and celebrated my Birthday too. Their food was delicious and definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"What happened to Arriba? Used to be a good reliable place for Mexican food. Service was crappy. Waiter never came to check on us or get us refills.  Chili relleno was horrible greasy mess. And it was so spicy it was completely inedible. It will be a miracle if I don't get sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"Great lunch special 4.99 chimichanga , rice ,beans with all you can eat  chips, salsa and refried beans. I would recommend it for lunch anytime, with fast service and with friendly service."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch today before heading over to see the A's Spring Training game.  Best mex food I've had for some time, but then its been 30+ years since we lived in LA.  Server was prompt, bi-lingual, attentive, and knew the menu (my wife is allergic to onions).  All in all, it was just what we were looking for... not fancy, not a take out burrito place, just decent eats.  Good for our Sat. early lunch. Didn't have a margarita."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but many mistakes. First, drinks took quite some time and the non-alcoholic drinks were delivered as alcoholic drinks. Secondly, when the food came it was not for our table. Lastly, the server had his hands full and put my credit card in his mouth to carry it back to the register. (Gross). The food took FOREVER. It was good food and the staff was eager to make it right, which is why the three star review."}
{"text":"went to the gilbertaz san tan cafe today with my 86 year old father  the hostess was so not wecoming and irritated when I first said patio seating then changed my mind for an indide booth thinking my father would be more comfotable   I think the San tan area on market place cafe needs more supervision and training  place not busy took over 1/2 hour for 2 fish lunches  the servers all seemed like if they smiled it would crack their face god forbid don't ask for ANYTHing extra such a s additional napkins or a little more lettice and onions etc  we just waited and waited paid the bill and left so many AWESOME places we could have gone to  very big dissapointment  especially  if you are driving and can't kill the time with a margarita!!!!!   simply does not resonate a happy place  done!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Arriba a few times now. I absolutely adore the 99 cent margaritas during both happy hour and reverse happy hour (9pm-close). The service is always friendly. This last time I had Melynda who made us feel like we were important and special and her presence was so warming. If you end up at this location, ask for her! The only complaint I have is that there aren't many healthy options. No matter what you get here, it's going to be a calorie bomb."}
{"text":"It's hard to even give one star.  We waited 25 minutes for a table but the restaurant was not busy so the wait seemed odd.  We then waited 30 MINUTES for food ordering just 4 entrees. One was uncooked, one was barely warm, they forgot a side of chicken and after requesting a drink with light ice, it was filled to the top with ice......  The restaurant manager that night was Bianca, who is not a manager at all.  No apologies, no coming back to check on things, very little comp for our concern of 2 entrees, a forgotten side and full price drink that was ALL ice.  UNACCEPTABLE.  Bad, cold and forgotten food is bad but when it is not handled right by the manager, THAT IS THE WORSE PART!!!!! Never going back!!!"}
{"text":"Service was almost as bad as the food... kinda feel like I've been robbed.  Looking forward to seeing who moves into this building when they go under"}
{"text":"It is much overpriced, and in my opinion the flavor and texture of the food was similar to what I would expect from any drive thru 'berto establishment. I don't mind that type of food when I'm paying 4 dollars and expecting to throw away a bunch of styrofoam.  But 40 dollars for two people for lunch and one drink each was money that could have been spent buying taco bell and a six pack of bottled margaritas, with money leftover for a tank of gas.  The layout of the establishment is also really weird. (And I'm coming to notice that I have an issue with weirdly laid out restaurants, but I digress.)  You're practically knocking people's food over to get to a table in the back. But this isn't a place you'd want that kind of attention.  This place gets a star for the drink being huge (and for the price, it should be) and giving me a cool buzz on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Arriba reminds me of this mix of a Quick Serve Restaurant and and a full service joint. The margaritas we had were FN awesome and massive. They were served in these hand blown blue glass via Mexico. As for the chow, my feed bag was already partially full but I made space for the Tortilla Soup. It was delish. However, Papa Chulos has the coolest presentation on theirs. My beauty, Twyla, had the pasole (spelling) and she dug on it. Our waiter, Pawnee, was both fun and efficient. He tripped us out with his name which actually stems from Syrian kings; how cool. Good food and good drink. Many locations in the Valley of the Sun. Check one out. #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"I've tried the appetizers (my fav. is the one with the jalepeno cream) and tacos here and I really like them. The service here is amazing and easygoing- nothing contrived and they didn't cause any discomfort."}
{"text":"Arriba's is an under rated New Mexican restaurant from my perspective based on previous Yelp reviews.   We popped into the one in Scottsdale for dinner on a Friday night. The parking lot is small for the size of restaurant but when you find a spot, you enter the restaurant by walking over a small bridge above a rather large water feature.   The ambiance is colorful and loud - parrots (TONS of them) hang from the ceiling along with flags and small bright lights (think Christmas lights).   They have a large selection of appetizers (try the cheese crisp) and they keep your table full of fresh chips, salsa AND bean dip! The food comes quick and hot! Spicy and temperature! Be sure to try the poblano relleno, chimichanga plate, and adobada chimichanga. Delish! ** please note we made special requests to individualize our order and we were not told no! Often we are told no when we want to make special requests so this was a nice change of pace - yes, there was an upcharge but we are happy to pay if our order can be modified and comes to the table as requested.   Our server was Chance and he was truly amazing! He explained the menu and sauces, kept our drinks full, and was very friendly! GREAT server! Be sure to ask for him and sit in his section! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing......had a large group and they gave the reservation away. They proceeded to seat on the patio 30 minutes after arrival and then took another 10 to get our drink order, another 10 to get us drinks, another 10 to get our food order and then 40 minutes until food arrived. Bad bad."}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly service!  Chips and salsa are really good too!  Wide selection from the bar and delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"My rating used to be 5 stars, but this place quickly went downhill. I used to get chips and salsa with taquitos every time I came here because they were really good. The last time I came in here, during the day, the taquitos weren't thoroughly cooked and the queso had a 'fishy' taste.  Tonight I came in and the salsa had to have been bottom of the barrel because there was almost no salsa in the salsa. It was almost all salsa water, or whatever it is. I actually got the taquitos at the same time as my chips and salsa, which was odd, and they were barely cooked at all. When I said something to the manager she replied \"well we are almost closing\". Instead of making excuses maybe she should be a real manager and address the issue with her employees because I don't like gambling with my food because employees are too lazy to do the jobs they are paid to do."}
{"text":"place wasnt so great.  i came here earlier today for lunch with my dad and some of his coworkers. the staff wasnt great. they got orders all wrong. food was average. ive had wayyy better in southern california. doubt i'll go back to this place."}
{"text":"Hilary our server was great! As were the food & drinks. Tuesday afternoon and it was very pleasant"}
{"text":"Been going to Arribas for years. It used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but the last few times that I have been it was not so good. The service was awful and the wait was too long. Also I was not to impressed with any of the food that day."}
{"text":"Arriba, Arriba! Let's get this over with. So they are definitely the home of the BIG ass margaritas and nothing more. The two times I ate here have both been a disappointing experience. They get the one star for being open on Christmas though.  So this place is definitely located in the right area. I'm certain the lack of seasoning I.e spice, flavor, is geared towards a few of my Caucasian brothers and sisters who dislike spicy food (no offense). As far as flavor goes, you can see pepper on your rice. The cheese (which is sprinkled on in quantity like a Panda Express employee would do 5 shreds at most) nor the sour cream does justice to such bland offerings.  I ordered the White Sands burrito the first time I came here over 5 years ago and it was so salty,  I'm certain I walked away with high blood pressure at a very young age. So this time around I ordered the burrito plate. I had the Machaca meat with the side of blands and rice....pardon beans and rice. With each cut of my burrito, water rushed out. Talk about sustainability, here's where our water is going Arizona. I would've enjoyed it more if the meat were drained and seasoned.  Our waitress was pretty good. I don't know her name though. Anyhow, the restaurant was pretty packed, so packed we sat next to the busiest bathroom ever. With each swing of the door, I could smell that pink colored hand washing soap. Not a minus though, hey it was a full house sit where you could.  In conclusion, I will NEVER come back here. Nothing against the service. It's not you Arriba, it's me not liking the food. Although the chips and salsa were alright.  P.s OMG the mints are amazing!"}
{"text":"I totally forgot about Arriba's being on Camelback and went there for lunch recently. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with their white sauce (can't remember the name) but it was very good! They are very aware of people on their lunch hour as they were SUPER quick. I will certainly be back for more."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had to wait forever to be seated. We went during lunch, but the place wasn't crowded.  Our server, Sara, was new but she did an excellent job. The food was great. Lots of flavor! The music and ambiance was great. Looks like a great place to grab a bite to eat with friends.    For 2 people, I paid $25 (not including the gratuity)."}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast. We always sit at the bar because we both enjoy hector. He is great at his job and is very friendly. Glad to see they brought the quality of food back up. It went down hill for a while but it looks like the new manager seems to keep the right stuff going. So happy because I love love love the breakfast skillet!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm I love happy hour here and food is always yummy! Chocolate chimi changas, sangrias. And service is usually really good."}
{"text":"We just tried this restaurant for the first time tonight, will not be going back! My husband was certain the salsa was not made in house. Chicken enchiladas with a few small pieces of dark meat.......terrible! Green corn tamale was tasteless. We were originally headed to Los Olivos......great food here, next time we will make the drive to their original location."}
{"text":"When someone specifies a vegetarian cheese enchilada, it might be important to leave the meat out. I ordered a platter for a party and some of them contained meat. The 99 cent Margarita I had while waiting was just ok, nice bar staff though. I'd return but only for chips & drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"I am perplexed by the recent reviews posted on this fine restaurant. I was recently here with my family, visiting my parents that reside in Goodyear.  We are from New Jersey, where Mexican restaurants are not as prevalent when compared to the greater Phoenix area. The few Mexican restaurants we do have locally are average at best. With a few exceptions in nearby Philadelphia. With that begin said, we read the reviews on here prior to trying this restaurant. With trepidation mind you, as some of these reviews are simply  negative. I can in all sincerity advise my dear readers that this restaurant was far from sub-par, nor even average. It was fantastic in fact, with a few minor exceptions.     First and foremost, upon first impression. The restaurant was clean, well light, and had all the aesthetics one could hope for in such a restaurant. It was a relatively large restaurant, well decorated, offering indoor and out door seating. We sat in a booth near the entrance, it was terrific. We all thought so. The service is a tad slow, but do you want well prepared food or fast food? If slow a service is an issue, then try taco bell. Otherwise, enjoy the experience this location has to offer. Our waitress was a bit neutral at first but quickly warmed up to us. She was friendly and curtious. The menu was extensive, and impressive. We ordered tacos, burritos and I tried the Mexican styled meatballs and grits soup, it was fantastic!!!! Consisting of fresh ingredients and tasty!        The entire meal, including adult and children's beverages was reasonably priced. We had enough food over, to have for diner the next day! My family and I enjoyed this restaurant thoroughly, and will return next year when we visit my parents again. Be your own judge and critic when checking out these various reviewed restaurants and locations listed on here. Some reviewers I question their authenticity, if they were not hired by the local competition, or are being forthright in their reviews, but are spoiled by all of the fantastic local Mexican restaurants you have out there. Oooo lay!"}
{"text":"How can you not enjoy an Arriba happy hour? 5PM-7PM weekdays if I am not mistaken including $1 margaritas and half price appetizers. That's right! $1 margaritas! They are delicious and completely make up for the pretty sad apps. Love it!"}
{"text":"Early memories of cheap margaritas and half way decent Mexican food. This screams Arriba all day long from the plain corn chips found stuck together. Down to the salsa that's tastes like it's made fresh once in a while. There is something charming about this location though. I continue to return because in a strange way the imperfections make me smile. Warmed up Fajitas complementing my margarita flowing out of a soda gun. Some of the best servers and bartenders in the food service industry can be found here. Join the fun, throw your hat in the air and just shout Arriba!"}
{"text":"Where Mexican food goes to die. Sure the people who work here are nice. But so what ? The food is straight out of 1990.. The drinks are so so. Just get out before you ever come in. 2 stars for good service. Less than one star for food. Simple."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be more like a chain but it in fact felt family owned.  The atmosphere was inviting, our waiter (Michael) was extremely polite and appropriately attentive and the food was not only really good but came really quick.  The deal on margarita for two was awesome also."}
{"text":"After seeing the other reviews for this place, I was nervous.  But it looked like they had decent frozen margaritas, so we gave it a shot.   Service was fast, friendly (despite our pickiness about what options were vegetarian), and our waitress checked back very regularly, even though it was pretty obvious we weren't ordering more drinks.   Atmosphere was pretty good.  Lots of families with kids, but at least no annoying birthday songs every 10 mins.  Place seems clean, and our booth was pretty comfy.  We only ordered one margarita each, and they're freakin huge! My house margarita was ok, the wife was less impressed with her frozen strawberry version.  As for the food... Meh.  They brought us chips to start.  The salsa and dip were good, but the chips were all either really stale, or really undercooked, and completely unseasoned.  I then had their regular chimmy, and the wife had a burrito.  Both of those were pretty good.  Bottom line, I think the place is worth a try.  I'm just not chomping at the bit to go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite shredded beef taco in my area.  The rest of the food is just satisfactory, nothing special.  But, when I am in the mood for tacos, this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"My visit was on a Wednesday night...the same night they offer fajitas for two for half price, $14.99.  The chicken and steak were not only plenty but very tasty.  The dips served with the nachos are also tasty.  My one complaint were the drinks. We ordered the Sunrise Margarita which is a cobination of Mango and Strawberry.  Although quite tasty is lacked KICK if you know what I mean ;) ."}
{"text":"Have been dining here for awhile and never had any issues until today. Had a very bad experience with the manager being very rude to me and my kids. We wound up leaving with him berating us the entire way out. His customer service approach was horrible and the waitress didn't pay attention to what we ordered. Unfortunately, one really bad experience tends to leave a bad taste in your mouth. Definitely won't be dining here again for awhile...at least until I know that the douchebag manager from today has moved on."}
{"text":"Hubs and I have been coming here for 15 years - even when it was formerly named Andale - and have never been disappointed. If you like spicy Mexican food, you must check this place out. Our standard fare that we share is the hatch chili cheese crisp and the rio grande enchiladas with carne adobada. Plenty of heat but very flavorful. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Arribas consistently has great tasting food and the service has always been very attentive.  The kids meals are only $5 and they are good quality food also.  I have never had to wait more than a few minutes for seat even on a Sunday or Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Stopped coming to this branch in Goodyear months ago because of poor service. Always liked their food, so decided to give them another chance tonight. Nothing has changed. Service is still horrible. We sat in the bar and unfortunately the bartender was our server and even though there was no one at the bar it took her quite a while to greet us. When she did she came empty-handed, no water, no chips and salsa. She asked  us what wanted to drink and if we were ready to order. We finally got our drinks , a margarita and a beer, except she brought a large beer which we hadn't asked for nor had she asked what size we wanted. She then brought  chips and salsa and we  placed our order. Needed more beans, so I set the bowl on the corner edge of the table to indicate this.  As our server walked by, without asking or saying a word, she picked up the bowl and never returned with more beans. After a while when she walked by again we flagged her down and ask for more beans she said sure but never got them. When she delivered the food she never questioned if we needed anything else, never asked if we needed more drinks and never asked us another thing. We thanked her to which she never responded.  She brought over the check, set it down without a word. Sad to say this is probably the worst service we've had here but bad service seems to be the standard."}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment several times over the years and unfortunately as much as I want to love it, the food is just barely mediocre at best. Service is good but I go for the food and its just ok..."}
{"text":"I went here the other day when I was in the area and my friend wanted to stop for lunch. She recommended this place, and I'm so glad she did! The salsa they bring out is delicious and you can make your food super spicy!   The best part though, was when I got the bill--2 margaritas, and each one was 99cents! I guess they have a daily happy hour every day from 3-7? Correct me if I am wrong, but yeah....that is pretty awesome. Sorry waitress, me and my friend were telling stories and laughing and were there for 3 hours and split a dish--our bill was under $11 including drinks! Haha, awesome!!  I just knocked off a star because the service wasn't super friendly...but I am not a picky little brat when it comes to that....I was In the restaurant business before too, and I know the Biltmore area can act a little too pretentious sometimes. I am going here again when I am staying in this area for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and cant ever get enough of it. The salsa is some of the best in the business. The queso is what I usually order."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the valley for mexican food. The bean dip and spicy salsa is mouth watering before you even open the menu. Pollo Con Queso is my favorite but everything I order is deliciois! The hatch chili pizza is an awesome appetizer to share with friends and has an awesome spicy kick. House margaritas are 1.99 at happy hour. Great atmosphere. I bring all my family and friends here when they visit from out of town. I guiltily go to this place at least once a week for happy hour or for dinner. Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight with my grandkids for the kids eat free day, and it was horrible. The waits were crazy, the service was slow, my order came out cold, and I could hear employees yelling at each other in the back. When it comes to being professional, this place has no standards. You're better off going to Filibertos for a good deal and better food/service. I will not be coming back to Arribas again, and I would advice anyone reading this to not go as well."}
{"text":"The service was great but unfortunately the Carne Asada on my mom's plate and my own was incredibly fatty. We were both quite disappointed. I was especially disappointed because I had never had the Carne Asada here.  I was also disappointed that this location did not light the appetizer queso fundido on fire like they do at other locations. For some reason the rice tasted weird too and the \"fresh\" tomatoes tasted bad as well."}
{"text":"We usually go for the happy hour specials. 1/2 off appetizers and $1 Margaritas. It's a great place to go on a Friday after work to unwind a bit without blowing the bank. Staff is always nice and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Service and ambiance were typical for a friendly, mainstream Mexican / American restaurant.  No complaints there.  Our server was quick with refills and made sure we were taken care of.  The restaurant itself was festively decorated and clean.  The food, however, was below par when compared to similar competition, being On the Border, Serrano's or Macayo's.  And we felt that pretty much across the menu they were also $1-$2 more per item.  But the big kicker....There just wasn't any flavor!  The food came quickly, as it usually seems to do in this style of dining establishment.  My wife and I ordered the \"Holiday Special\" burrito, made with beef and two kinds of chili sauce.  I made it through two bites and was so unimpressed I just stopped eating.  I also added an a la carte beef taco to my burrito...at a cost of $4.99.  There was no flavor coming from that shredded beef that would've given me a hint I was eating southwestern food.  I don't expect much from a $5 kids meal, so I'll give that those were okay, Kraft mac and cheese for one and a burger and fries for the other.  I'm not going to write Arriba's off our future nights out.  Maybe we just got a bad batch of coming out from the kitchen that night.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing and should have asked for a recommendation.  In any case we'll give them another shot."}
{"text":"Food and price were very good. My wife and I could not have had a better server than Erica. Definitely will be coming back   Look for their lunch specials great deals"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Really great food and a fun environment. Of course, I'm not super picky when it comes to mexican food but still, it's one of the tastiest I've had. We often meet friends at Arriba's to hang out, eat & have fun. Great place for groups."}
{"text":"At lunch time in this area, parking sucks. Staff are friendly. Food is nice and spicy. Tastes really good though, so I get heartburn later. Prices are average for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"What happened to this place ? Service has gone way down hill. Waited 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge our table. She approached us without an apology, only asking what we would like to drink. She then made some complaint about having to work with \"New People\". Apparently they were to blame for her poor service. Took another several minutes for chips and dip to arrive. Ordered the mini Chimi's as an appetizer only to find that they were frozen in the middle. We sent them back and another order was returned to us free of charge, but they appeared microwaved. Other than that, the food was fine. My biggest complaint was with the uninspired service. The restaurant appears poorly managed, and of poor morale. Our server clearly didn't care about doing her job well. I don't believe I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area for a business meeting and invited a couple clients to lunch. This place seemed perfect. The service was not. They were super slow and the waitress didn't have much pep in her step. All of our taco meet was blan as it could be. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The poor reviews for this Arriba's are correct. I wish I would have read them before I wasted my time and money eating there. There was a large spill left under our table. It looked like a spilled drink because of the lemon in the middle of the puddle. The table was short of napkins and silverware. We had to beg for more. The service is horrific !  The food is terrible and overpriced. The rice had so much pepper on it that none of us could eat it. The cheese enchiladas were cold and tasteless. The beer was not cold. Don't waste your time and money. You'd get a better mexican meal at Taco Bell or Del Taco."}
{"text":"Omg, what happened to this place. Had some shopping to do across the street.  Me & boyfriend stopped in after work, sat in the bar. Checked out the grease covered hh menu,  order a beer & Jim beam.  Drinks come & the beer is half ass cold, Jim was fine. Chit chatting with the old man & we noticed a fly...no big deal...As the conversation progressed we couldn't keep the conversation going without swatting flies.  After a while I burst out into hysterical laughter,  this shit was ridiculous!  Instantly transported back to rocky point hungover eating fly infested tacos roadside and you don't care because your lucky to have survived the night in Mexico!  Its Ok, I'm Mexican I can say this shit! Anyway still sitting at the bar waiting for pozole & enchiladas,  the couple right behind us is in sneezing distance - literally this fucking guy is sneezing open mouth all over the place, my back was wet.  Fuck it, I actually taste the food. Eh,  the posole was decent & the spinach enchiladas salty.   Oh wait we also ordered taquitos appetizer.  See the photo, the fucking fly posted for a SELFIE!   You want Mexican,  tons of other places. Skip this place, overpriced.  Loved it back in the day, crash & burn this place is toast!"}
{"text":"My stomach still hurts 8 months later when I think of this place.  I had dinner here when I was 7-8 months pregnant. For some reason they don't serve veggie fajitas here like most other restaurants. I asked the server if they could make them anyway, I figure they have the veggies on hand grill 'em and slap on my plate please. He said sure they would be able to accomodate my request. What I received was nothing but a giant pile of grilled onions. I shit you not. Our server actually brought this to me. No green pepper, no tomato, no nothing. Just onion. WTF. I was starving, nothing else appealed to me so I stuffed my tortillas with onions, rice and guacamole. Had the worst heartburn ever. Oh, to top it off they had the balls to charge something like 14.99 for it!  Never going back."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  The food is inexpensive but taste that way.  The only thing good is the bean dip and salsa that you get at the beginning of the meal along with hot corn and flour chips.  The rest of the meal is bland."}
{"text":"They have the best server here.  Seriously, if serving was a sport, there would be scouts trying to steal this guy away from this Arriba's.  I wish all servers were exactly like him.  He puts great thought and attention into his suggestions.  Aside from server of the year, Arriba's is a my favorite of the Garcia/Macayo type of Mexican food chains.  The food tastes fresh and it seems like there's some thought behind the menu, not just the typical meals.  It's not my first pick of restaurants but they have cheap margaritas!"}
{"text":"I am only giving an extra star cause our waitress was very friendly and helpful but I was not happy with the food. The plates came out super hot like couldn't touch hot but the food was lukewarm. And I also didn't like that we ordered our food and a few minutes later it was brought to the table like it was sitting under a lamp or something. I will definitely not be back here again."}
{"text":"After some of the bad reviews on Yelp I almost didn't bother going here but I am glad I did.  I found everything from the drinks to the food to be great.  The only warning I would give is that when they say something is spicey.. . they mean spicey.  I am used to places over selling how hot a dish is but this place undersells.  In fact, if I had known I would have ordered something with a little less kick."}
{"text":"I have some friends that ALWAYS go to Arriba and they always talk about it. I seriously don't know why! I now feel sorry for them because if this is what they think is good Mexican food they've got it all wrong!!!  My daughter had finished 2nd grade that day and I let her pick any place of her choice. Lo and behold she shouted: Arriba momma!!!! :S  Well, to Arriba we went myself and 4 kids.  I don't even want to tell you what we had but it was HORRIBLE!!! I'm actually embarrassed to say we went!!! Stay away from there!! We've been told that they have great margaritas but I don't know if I should believe that anymore.   No more Arriba for us. I also think that it is overpriced!! Not worth to pay that much money for junk food...Go to Filiberto's and get rolled tacos... seriously!!!"}
{"text":"I have always heard of this place on tv. I was around the area and decided to check it out. Walking in was not to expectations. It's to dark, dungeony and it has a weird smell and very hot in here. The place highly needs some upgrades and natural light. I was by myself to I sat at the bar. Ordered house margarita... Prices are from $7-16.99 a drink depending on the ounces. The staff is nice but not friendly. The restaurant provides u with chips, salsa and spicy bean dip. I have ordered from the lunch menu and seems a little high priced for a lunch min. 7.99- 12.99 majority is $9.99  a plate without an al carte option. I had gone to discount tires and obtained a 20% coupon for eating at arrivals since it's right next door."}
{"text":"On a busy Saturday night still plenty of room to be seated. This place is huge!!  Honestly the first time I went here I wasn't impressed a few years ago. But decided to give it another shot and I am glad we did. Hubby had the Steak Tacos and he really enjoyed them. I had a Chimi and it was awesome.  We definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Great food!  Service was quick and friendly. Food was cooked perfect and tasted outstanding.   Price was fair and portions large."}
{"text":"We go to a few locations and this is my least favorite.  The food here is always just fine- honestly we come because the menu items are inexpensive and we can get a huge Margarita for $8.00.  All this is fine, but when paired with poor service it makes for an unenjoyable experience. The server had to be reminded multiple times to being water, side plates, chips etc. she spoke so quietly that my husband could absolutely not understand her. Like whisper quiet. There seemed to be a manager on duty and he was a bit strange.. I assume he was a manger...? He was visiting tables but not introducing himself. He came to ask how our food was and we told him that the potatoes ( it was brunch. Yes we had a massive margarita, don't judge)..  were so dry that they were inedible . He said.. \"ummm ok. \" long pause. ....\"I can bring you some more?\" Just apologize and say you'll find a solution. We're not looking for a free meal, but remedy the situation.   So two stars for this locations staff"}
{"text":"I just had the absolute worst experience ever at a restaurant at this location. The bad part was the food. The worst part was the service. Some how my wallet had fallen out of my purse, so I went to my car to get it. I had already asked my server for the bill because I was in a hurry and she took forever to come back to my table. As I was walking back in to pay and finish my food she was walking out and even though she is watching me walk back in with my wallet in hand she says very loudly,\"you didn't pay your bill.\" I told her I went out to get my wallet from the car and I was returning to finish my food and pay. I told her she wAs rude and disrespectful. Her only reply was that they have problems with people leaving without paying. They have lost a customer for life and I will never recommend this restaurant over a bill of $11.12. Good job!"}
{"text":"Their happy hour prices are nothing to complain about. The free chips and salsa are appreciated, and not bad at all. The actual food though, the shredded beef quesadilla and beef taquitos we ordered, left much to be desired. They weren't terrible, but also far from good.  I can honestly say that Taco Bell does it better. If not for the happy hour prices, I perhaps wouldn't have left feeling as content as I did - or perhaps it was the margaritas (also on happy hour). Next time I'll probably just go just for those and the chips, and just leave the food out of it.   The server was friendly enough, but we didn't see her very much, and did a lot of waiting around for refills. The rainforest art on the outdoor patio wall is nice to look at, but the tables are small and look a little dated. Arriba could make a few updates to the look and menu and start drawing in crowds comparable to Oreganos next door."}
{"text":"It was family day (the ex and I like to see our son smile) and we were starving... after driving around for a while we pulled up to Arriba's and said \"what the hell...\"  That's also what we said when some of the food came, as in \"what the hell is this??\"  So positive first.  The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chips were warm and salsa had a nice (suprising) kick.  Kick... do I sound like an old lady?   Morgan and I ordered fish tacos and beef tacos, respectively, so we could swap one for one.  Fish was ok... nothing spectacular... but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios.  Not worth it here.  Rice was ok, some flavor, probably converted rice though.  Beans were... blended?  I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans!  This stuff was like brown goo... YUMMMMMMMM... :P  The beef taco was just weird.  I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat!  WTF?  I couldn't eat much of it.    Last but not least, Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga.  That sh*t looked nasty to be honest.  Covered with some gooey white sauce, filled with pork.  LOL, he said it tasted like hot dog.  Um, yikes!  He took about 2 bites and was \"full\".  A.K.A., he didn't like it.  I also had a margarita... it was HUGE and didn't taste very good.  I'd rather have one 1/4 that size that tasted nice.  Oh well.  One star for the chips and salsa.  Like I said, the fish taco was okay, but every thing was just way over-priced!    Final verdict?  We decided to NEVER go there again."}
{"text":"Went here for thanksgiving lunch. Our server was Carolina. Good service, she made sure to follow-up with us. I ordered the chicken taco salad which was not good. Lacked flavor and the beans tasted like they were canned. My boyfriend had the chicken flautas and corn tamale. He said the tamale was delicious. We would definitely give it another try and order the tacos next time."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place isn't rated higher.  I've been to eat here with my family a few times, and it is now one of our favorite places.  Each time we've been there, the service has been great, the place pretty clean, and all of the dishes ordered have been either good or really great.  Atmosphere is super casual and noisy but not too loud.  We like to go on Sundays when kids eat free and breakfast is available (only served on weekends).  Warm tortilla chips come out with your drinks along with tomato salsa and a yummy spicy bean dip.  So good.    Last visit was during lunch happy hour on a Tuesday.  I got a burrito plate with half chile colorado and half chile verde. One of the best burritos I've ever had!  The lunch special was 99 cent ground beef tacos.  My husband ordered 5 tacos because they were so cheap and thinking they'd be small, so-so tacos and not anything special.  Then they arrived and were so fresh and delicious, not to mention much bigger than he expected!  Warm crispy corn tortilla shells were filled with yummy seasoned ground beef and served with shredded cheese, lettuce, tomato, and the optional sour cream and guacamole.  Just simple ingredients that were fresh and SO GOOD when put together.  I got a taste and marveled over how tasty they were.  I'll be back soon on another Tuesday just to get that lunch special!  Then we'll be back on another Sunday for some breakfast too!  Note:  If you're sensitive to spicy food, be sure to mind the spice meter on the menu, or ask the server if the dish is mild."}
{"text":"Best place ever! I would recommend getting the pollo con queso, or the white sands chimi, both amazing plates, service is amazing. Everything I could want=)"}
{"text":"Went in for Happy Hour and some 99 cent margaritas.  They weren't great, but hey...they were 99 cents!   The girls at the hostess stand greeted us with smiles on their faces and seated us in the bar as we requested.  Once seated, service was prompt and everyone was very friendly.  Our server came to check on us several times to see how we were doing.  Within seconds of sitting down, we had our chips, salsa and a bowl of a chorizo and bean dip at our table.  Our margaritas were brought to our table by another server because ours was helping another table.  She was also very friendly and asked if we needed anything.    We shared a Hatch green chile burger and it was very tasty.    I have read in previous reviews how service has been horrible at this location.  I am thinking they may have read these reviews and made some changes, because we experienced quite the opposite today.    I am a firm believer in giving places a second chance and I'm glad I gave this place theirs.  The food may not be what it is like back home in New Mexico, but for Happy Hour...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and me and my boyfriend come here all the time and get the same thing. We also get the same waiter, Steve, every time and he's amazing. He remembers what we get and always super nice and funny. He makes the visit at Arribas a lot more enjoyable."}
{"text":"First time here, I had the green chile enchiladas with queso fundido and they were delicious! Im definitely coming back.  Our server was great but I got refried beans instead of black beans like I requested, quick fix but the server said I said refried so that's why they get 4 stars and not 5.  But the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Idk why this place had only 2 and a half stars! I have been here a few times and was very pleased. My wife is hard to please and she LOVED this place. The food was delicious, the service was great, and the portions were hearty!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and even better service. It took a bit longer than normal for our food to come out. When it did, my husband's food was cold. They took it back and the manager brought the hot food back out and personally apologized. He comped the meal, offered a free dessert and brought a coupon for a free appetizer for our next visit! I absolutely love that not only dos they fix the problem but went above and beyond to correct the issue without is having to ask for it! Bravo Arribas!!"}
{"text":"Not only did they get my order wrong which I called and explained.  After I ate my food I received on of the worst food illnesses I have ever had in my life.  I was so sick from throwing up and had the shits for two days!  Serious Arriba what the F are you chefs doing.  Never again for me and I suggest you don'y come here either!"}
{"text":"Discusting.  Hard tamales covered in a gross green sauce which made the outside gummy.  Rice was horrible."}
{"text":"This place was just okay for me. As a vegan, there were hardly any options for me and what I did get definitely left something to be desired. I also spent way more money than I expected to ($2.50 to add a tiny glob of guac? Really?).  I did love the salsas, though, and the hot sauce is very tasty. I would go back and just munch on the chips and dips that they bring you, but I wouldn't order anything off the menu. I've had better Mexican food for cheaper."}
{"text":"Great food! Good service and close to San Tan! My family will be back for sure. They took a while on my plate but comped it without me asking, can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"I don't care what the haters say, I thought this place was dope. Really cool atmosphere and set up with a huge bar.  The bartender was helpful with choosing. There was at least 10 different lunch specials with daily special ad well, making it a cheap stop.  I got the Rio Grande enchilada which had queso fundido on top. Super delicious. It was one of the cleanest Mexican places I've been to in the area as well.   I'm guessing this place is a lot different when it's super crowded but if you're at a packed restaurant I don't know what you're expecting.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Im drooling just thinking about this place!!! Once again, had a bad craving for Mexican food and was across the street. SOOOOOO good. First, the fact that they brought out salsa AND bean dip, I love. Not everyone likes salsa, I liked having a little of both. Both were good. I ordered the 3 cheese chimi with jalapeno cream cheese. OHHH MY GOSH!!! One of the best items ive had, of all Mexican food dishes!!! Obsessed. Probably will only order that from here on out at this place. The waitress was so nice, and attentive. Margarita was cheap and good. AND on sundays kids eat free. Good food cheap liquor and free to feed the kid?! Winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Food was good! House margaritas were an abomination... Do not order! Service good not great! Thank God the food was good! Most likely will not revisit! Sad, As I was a frequent visitor when I lived in San Diego!"}
{"text":"A Mexican friend  of ours recommended Arriba's. We usually order take out, the 2 times I ate at the restaurant, service was poor and food was not as good.   Luckily, every time we order for take out the food has been very good. The chips and salsa are always fresh. My husband likes the chicken chimi platter and we had try the carne adobada pizza, plate and sampler platter. I like the way they seasoned the food, not too salty and you can taste the spices. Leftovers taste better (though maybe mushy) the next day.  So, service and food at the restaurant will be a 2, but since I always have a great take out experience, I'll give them 4 stars"}
{"text":"We are both picky eaters, and go out to eat a few times a week.  It takes a pretty good meal, good service, and a clean restaurant for me to give 4 stars.   I ordered the chicken tostada.  My friend ordered the chili verde burrito with green sauce. We both liked our meals. He said the burrito was just right.  Not too spicy, just enough.  The hatch chilis were tasty, and there were just the right amount of them.  It's a good size burrito.  Enough to have a few bites to put in a to go box. My tostada was good also.  The chicken was a bit dry though.  The waiter brought me a dish of green chili verde sauce to pour over it.  That worked well.  I'm a complete wimp when it comes to spicy food, and the tostada was not too spicy.  On the table is bean dip, as well as salsa.  If you like spicy, the bean dip is for you.  The corn chips are of better quality than most Mexican food restaurants.   We were first seated in a dining room that has a water fall all along one wall.  It was an enjoyable atmosphere.  However, my extremely sensitive nose (caused by fibromyalgia), detected a slight mildew smell.  So, we were escorted to the dining room that has the bar.  We admired the woodwork wall that must have taken some talent to build.   The women's bathroom is clean.  The hand soap has a strong and unpleasant scent.  And a modern paper towel dispenser."}
{"text":"Love the bean dip you get with the salsa and chips.  I like spicy and the Hatch Chicken Especial delivers in spades!  The White Sands chimi is also very good and packs a good kick.  Really great place if you want to find a Mexican restaurant that has mild, medium, and spicy food on the menu."}
{"text":"Best part of dining experience (6pm on a Thurs nite):  We were seated right away and chips, salsa, and bean dip came immediately to our table.  Our waiter appeared quickly to take our drink orders.  Requests for refills on chips/dips and extra napkins were taken care of promptly.  Our food was good, hot, fresh, and plentiful.  The flour tortillas on the side tasted a lot like flour tho.   I had the Chile Poblano with chicken and green sauce, refried beans and rice.  Very nice presentation and tasty!  My friend had the White Sands Chimichanga and she said it was good too.  Our waiter, Calixto, gave us excellent service and attention to detail.   Not so good aspects of dining experience:  Crowded, warm, noisy.    Watch out for soft drink prices: $2.49 and extras, a small scoop of guac also $2.49.  Ladies' restroom very small and hot."}
{"text":"One would think living so close to Mexico that allll the Mexican food would be good. WRONG!  DO NOT GO HERE!!!   My friend and I ordered 2 Cabo Wabo Margaritas.  The first round was decent but the 2nd round tasted like a nasty $2 house mix.  I brought it to the waiter's attention that there was a large stash of salt at the bottom of my drink.  Which I found odd that there was zero salt on the rim.  He took the drink back and sure enough attempt #2 was yellow, tasted like a mix and once again had a large pile of salt on the bottom with none on the rim.  In speaking again to the waiter he assured me that it would be right the 3rd time and it was a learning lesson for the bartender since they were new.  I stated that it was fine and I really didn't want the drink.  He then brings back the same thing.  My friends drink was just as bad.  The highlight was that when getting our bill all drinks were left on the bill.  My full $10 nasty drink was left, in which was wrong and I didn't want.  I will never return to this restaurant, not that it was my pick in the first place.  It is overpriced for what you get with bad service that does not care about the customer."}
{"text":"I really like this place just for their fiesta ambiance, good salsa and chips, and great service. They offer such an extensive variety on their menu, it's fun going back just to try new things. Their enchiladas are GRRREAT!!"}
{"text":"I decided to try something new. I picked the New Mexico Enchiladas the photo on the menu made it look good. Very disappointed. It tasted very bland. The enchiladas didn't taste cooked the ground beef had no flavor. Their salsa is pretty good and the bean dip. But the main course just stunk. No flavor."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Food is ok. Service is ok. Prices are a little high. Atmosphere is blah.  You can put it along with Macayo's, Chile's, Applebees, etc. Just nothing special. No reason to go back. Gringo Mexican. Just blah!"}
{"text":"We went today, June 22, 2014 which is a Sunday at 1:00pm. We expected it to be busy at this time on a Sunday but it was pretty bare.   The hostesses didn't seem to know what they were doing. One of them sat my family (my husband and our 4 year old son) at a table and then we never heard from anybody again. 15 minutes and not one person came to our table despite a couple (literally only two) servers looking our way and then walking away. We decided it wasn't worth it anymore and left. On our way out, we saw the manager up front with the hostesses and he didn't seem like he was doing much. Funny that he was up front with nobody to seat and not walking around in an almost empty restaurant to make sure that the tables that were there were being taken care of.   The hostesses and the manager said, \"Thanks for coming in!\" without looking up at as. I glanced at all of them with a confused look and finally the girl that sat us looked right at me with an expression that said, \"Wait. I sat them just 15 minutes ago...???\"    They need to get a better system going. Maybe have the hostess TELL the servers that they have people seated. Or maybe have the manager manage it all. Either way, I don't know what the food tastes like because we never got there."}
{"text":"We had a great waitress Jennifer in the bar, ordered steak and chicken fajitas, they were good but not great. All in all a good experience but just average food."}
{"text":"The food is good nice and fresh. The servers are very attentive and make sure you have everything you need to enjoy your meal. I had the Santa Fe chicken salad and my friend had the Hatch chicken especial. Delicious!! We always come here it's close to our home!"}
{"text":"Margaritas and Nachos appetizers thats all we had  and we enjoyed it  cant speak of much else quick service  we did not have dinner i didnt think it was a place i would have dinner but apps and a cocktail A-OK"}
{"text":"Some like it hot. If you're one of those people, you'll like this place. The food is tasty and some of this dishes have a nice kick to it.   I probably come here about 5 times a year when I'm going out to eat with my family. Good place to feed and seat 6-8 people groups. The service is usually descent and the prices aren't too bad."}
{"text":"I will not be returning to this place.  It was terrible.    The service sucked, we waited for ever our order was wrong. Just bad all around. Third time there. Last time there!"}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to be sure to bring me here during my visit because it is one of her favorite places to eat now.  I can see why.  The atmosphere is very nice, the prices are reasonable and the food is very good.  Today was \"Chimichanga Thursday\" so I got a Chicken Chimichanga for only $1.99!  I asked the waiter how much it would be to add in rice and beans (if I'd seen how big it was I would have seen I didn't need anything else) and he told me $3.  I said, for both? And he said yes.  I'm sorry, but I believe the waiter should know how much the food costs and when I got the bill it said I was charged $1.99 each for the side dishes.  I didn't complain but I did knock a dollar off my usual 20% tip.  If he had told me it was the right price I wouldn't have done that.  He was nice enough, but I got charged $2.39 for one cup of coffee and he never did come around to see if I wanted a refill--nor did he refill our water either.  I mean, this is ARIZONA,  you should refill people's water in a restaurant.  No brainer.  You would think.  I would still come back here, just be more aware and assertive.   (4/16/09)"}
{"text":"Every time someone brings up this place I literally cringe. Now before I continue, when I dislike a place with the amount of hatred that I have for an awful place like arribas, there is a good reason. I will never base my opinion off of one meal, I will give a place multiple chances before I write it off completely.  The food is absolutely disgusting, either too salty or not flavorful at all, I can not stand a single thing at this place. Just thinking about it makes me wonder how this place stays in business. Nachos..nasty Enchiladas..nasty Rice...nasty Flautas...NASTY! I could go on forever!  How a restaurant can screw up a big bowl margarita is beyond me..but somehow..this place can do it! Don't go here, recommend this place only to your worst enemy. EW!"}
{"text":"Ok Arriba - I want to love you.  I really do.  The last three times I went to happy hour, during happy hour, the bar tender tells me that all the items on the happy hour menu are not actually on the menu.  The last time I was there- I'll quote the bartender \"anything with cheese\" is not on the happy hour menu.  Although the menu they gives you says otherwise....cmon guys.  Dinner last night was meh- carne adobada was hot temperature wise but not spicy.  Beans were a bust and seemed watered down.  .  Go for drinks and chips - go and see if they have the same happy hour technique for you too.  **update and my final visit.  The hostess team is awesome.  The remainder of the crew just doesn't have any effs to give.  The service is meh, the food is meh, and the chips are just flat stale.   Summation- about $25 per person for dinner drinks.  If this was a dive bar and beers were $1.00 it would be legit.  However it's not a dive bar, it's just a dive.  Skip it- trust me."}
{"text":"Restaurant is cute, I loved that atmosphere. Great prices typically yummy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday and got the daily special. Yum! Food was amazing. The margarita was delicious and plenty of tequila! The lack of star is bc we were seated on the patio and it took 10mins before our waiter came over to greet us."}
{"text":"Well i seen some 1 and 2 stars, don't know what the hell they talking about, but this place rocks. I gave them a 4 star cuz too many people take their kids and cant control them there. LOL.   But the food is the SHIZZNIT!!!!   The Chips they bring out are nice crunchy and salt to taste. the salsas and the Lil bean dip uffffff, love it.   The food is nice and spicy, since I'm Mexican i can handle the heat.  I always get the Pollo con Queso, can you say DELISIOSO!!!  My favorite.   Waiter/es all are kind and helping on ordering.  If your into Mexican food, its a need to try."}
{"text":"Visited the Gilbert Restaurant tonight at 7pm.  Host was unfriendly, took 3 other tables before seating us (a table of 5).  We did our drink and food order at the same time.  After 30 minutes without food (3 adult meals and a kids meal.  2nd child did not eat) and two tables around us being seated and served drinks from the bar AND dinner, I went to the front to speak to a manager.  Manager said he would check on it and be back to me.  He never returned to me to check on us.  6 minutes later, our food was delivered.  We asked for extra napkins and a cup of water for my nephew.  Never received either.  The two tables around us that came in later were paying their checks while we were barely eating.  A simple dinner took over an hour.  No one apologized or explained why our food took so long.  We will not be returning to your establishment as I was completely disappointed in our experience."}
{"text":"The decor defiantely needs some help.  I'm not sure what they are trying to accomplish with the african animal heads on the wall but it is strange.  This place is more suited to be a Rainforest Grill then a Mexican food restaurant.   The happy hour margaritas are awful.   The taste like a lime Otter Pop and I'm sure they just kind of waved the tequila bottle over the glass for a second or two.  I had the burrito platter with machaca.  They didn't drain the meat so there was quite a bit of liquid but the flavor was good.  The red sauce was okay.  They charged me $2 for a side of sour cream which was ridiculous.  I had the house brewed amber which was okay, nothing special.    I love the salsa and bean dip they serve with the chips!  The chips are great too.    We had a huge party and the waitress, Alba, was great.  She gave us all separate checks and and the service was great!"}
{"text":"I had the Chili Colorado and wow it was great!  I eat a lot of tex-mex so I wanted something different.  Beef in a stew with jalapeños, beans and rice. It came with flour tortillas.  Very tasty.  The beef was very tender and perfect.  Their beans and rice have a lot of flavor too.  The service is always very attentive and liberal with the free warm chips, salsa & warm bean dip... mmm.  The ambiance is typical tex-mex with Spanish themed items on the walls and bright colors.  This location is a bit cozy, but it has a nice feel.  I came in with a party of 10 and they were able to seat us quickly, our food came out quicker than expected and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Plus they recently updated their menu to include pictures of ALL entries. Not everyone's thing but I appreciate it and so will your family.  Grab a couple chocolate-mint candies as you leave."}
{"text":"Bad choice for a Saturday lunch.  For some reason, we were seated in the bar. No big deal I guess. Server  was not friendly about how she informed us that the cheaper priced margaritas were a pre mix....we wanted a margarita but it was just the way it was presented that made us stick to water. It took forever to get our food. One burrito and a grilled chicken salad. I'm pretty sure she forgot to turn our order in. The part that really ticked me off is that she made no mention of the delta until she brought the check. Service was lousy. I also blame their management for poor training. Food was ok.... Too many Mexican food choices to say that I will be back."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and the place stinks really bad. Not sure if it's old rag smell, but they need to bleach this place bad. Breakfast was served cold."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to have some drinks so we could continue our shopping day. Got seated right away, but had to request the patio instead of being asked inside or outside. Once seated, we were waiting quite a bit for service. I get it, it happens sometimes so we just waited patiently. Finally got our beverages and hung out for quite a bit. The chips and salsa were great and they made our drinks as per requested. Not spectacular, but not awful. If you're looking for food here, try the \"White Sands Chimi\" OMG....so good!"}
{"text":"The restaurant definitely has potential. The food is average, not great. The chips and salsa are good, sometimes really good depending on the bean dip that day. The salsa i personally dont care for. It it chunky and not so great in flavor. The reason for the 3 stars is the server was very very slow, and they had this 1800 margarita drink they said was on special for $8.99. We ordered one each, and it was 90% ice which really not what i paid for. We let the server know so she can perhaps remedy the issue, but she just said \"I'm sorry. Do you want another one?\" Um, no. (We don't want to pay $9 for a glass of ice and very little margarita.) I would appreciate if she had checked on us and cleaned our plates which sat there forever cluttering up the table. Finally, we ordered a to go nachos for our son who was at home which shame on me for not opening the box, but they were cold which explains why it took so long to get them. They were probably sitting there for a while before being brought out to us. The photo I'm attaching is actually after the ice had melted some and towards the end of our visit."}
{"text":"i had a big craving for Arriba's, so we went last night. It was a big mistake. The service was downright poor taking 22 full minutes before being even acknowledged. Chips and salsa took even longer to arrive, but i forgot to look at my phone to see how much longer. No water was offered, so we had a full bowl of chips and salsa with NO drinks at all. Finally the harried waitress arrived to take our order. Mind you, it was NOT super busy at dinner time. We got our drinks finally, and then about midway thru we had refills without really wanting them as if to make up for the slow service. Food was ok. Service was very slow. Checkout was so slow that i almost walked up to the front desk to pay. Good thing the harried waitress arrived when she did. Overall, i felt like i wasted my evening. Oh, one more thing. They really should offer a drink menu as it is a mexican restaurant, and there are various types of tequila. Some people really are particular about their tequilas, and there are literally NO PRICES, no margarita menus, none at all. Literally the weirdest thing ever. I did not order a margarita last night, but i did last week when we were here, and the waitress had to go back and check if they had certain types and what the cost were. You're in the dark with what they have and pricing."}
{"text":"My husband and I ran across the street to have a margarita at the bar and meet a friend. Restaurant had a line but there were a lot of empty dirty tables. We found several open seats at the bar and had only been sitting a moment when the manager came over and asked us to leave. She told us the entire restaurant was on a waitlist, even the bar. She didn't offer to add us to the list or ask if we were just having drinks; she just told us we couldn't sit there and needed to leave. It's been a few years since I have been here and now I remember why. Zero stars would be more appropriate since we had zero experience."}
{"text":"I wasn't surprised to see the rating when I looked it up.  I came with some girlfriends who live in the area yesterday, and left feeling like a poophead for recommending the place.    I always liked the Arrowhead location (but after talking about it, found it was probably cuz I always order a margarita and am a lil tipsy :)...    The waitress was rude, she looked at my friend like she was stupid when asked if the chicken or beef fajita was better.  The food was just not that good at all.  The fajitas came out overcooked.  Some cups and silverware were dirty. My chimi was so-so.   The cheese crisp was yummy though.  I will stick with the Arrowhead location for my margaritas and cheese crisps."}
{"text":"This local chain is certainly in decline, but still offers some very unique New Mexico flavors. Their many restaurants differ widely in cleanliness and service. This location in Awatukee was above average in cleanliness and the service was top notch. Our waiter handled our dietary needs and desire to get in and out very fast.  You almost can't lose with the New Mexico-style dishes (many of which are very spicy), but stay away from the \"Guacamole Dip\" appetizer. In an effort to make the dish seem bigger they pile it on top of a bed of cabbage, and toss it with tons of coarse chopped fresh tomatoes as filler. Much of the guacamole is lost in the process, and what is left is flavorless anyway.  Highly recommend the Banderra Enchiladas."}
{"text":"I get that this is a Mexican food establishment but shouldn't the servers know more english than what's on the menu? I've been here twice and the first time was better than the second. I had a hard time communicating with the server on the second visit that made me feel like the first visit kind of a 50/50 shot that i had a good time.  The building also seems a little on the rugged and dirty side...really, REALLY dim lighting as well. I could barely read the menu!  Aside from the questionable service and quality of the place, the food is quite enjoyable. Try the cheese crisp!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here frequently, my favorite is the White Sands Chimichanga, it  is always good I have not had a bad meal here ever. The staff is friendly and the service is excellent. I also recommend their chili relleno.  Their prices are moderate and the portions are generous. If you want good New Mexico style mexican food in Phoenix, this is the place. Every part of the meal is good. No canned beans or tasteless rice here."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour and sat down at a booth in the bar. Waited for someone to come over and take our order. Many servers walked by and ignored us. Finally walked out."}
{"text":"As far as Mexican food goes, this is not my first pick...or my second...or my third, come to think of it.  We have been here 3 times, and each time the food is just okay.  The menu is very large, and the prices are a little high for the quality of the food.    I do enjoy the cheese enchiladas with red sauce.  Tonight I had the Fajita salad.  It was a pretty presentation, but the red cabbage was hard, it was served with no dressing, there were 2 slices of jalapenos or chiles that accidentially made it in there.  Ouch!    Let me back up... the first dish I ordered was the chicken salad.  It was white meat chicken mixed in a jalapeno mayo of sorts served over iceberg lettuce and tomato.  There were also several slices of cucumber.  There was only 1 pepper on the menu denoting a mildly hot dish, but this was a scorcher!  I asked for a replacement of something else.  The waitress was nice enough to do that.  M had the same salad, and he wasn't impressed.  I had the tortilla soup that came with flour tortillas.  Their tortillas are bland and I don't enjoy them at all.    I have seen their humongous margaritas.  They are enough for 304 people!  We go there because we are familiar with the Hatch chile, but if you have another choice of Mexican food, take it.. ."}
{"text":"Came to the bar to have couple cocktails with friends and our bartender Daphine was the rudest human being I ever met. All we got was eyes rolling and rudeness. We think she was pissed because she wanted to be off and wanted some Angry Crab we will not be back and I'll make sure to spread the word being a local bartender myself."}
{"text":"Woohoooo  My 100th Yelp Review!!!!    Met up with a friend for dinner on a Tuesday night, he picked the placed and picked Arriba's, I was down for that cuz I do love the spicy food and here they cook with the Hatch Green Chile!!!    I got to the table and was greeted by our waiter, Dave, who had a dimple it was cute when he smiled, haha.    I ordered ice tea to drink, friend ordered coke, We placed our orders and got to talking and I swear it only took like 10 mins for the food to come out to us, it was like they were waiting for us to order LOL  My friend ordered an appetizer for dinner, really?? When I know I am going out to dinner, I order a meal and I don't like it with the other person just orders a app or something and they are like oh I'm not that hunger, dude did you forget we were going out to eat?? LOL and believe me that's what I told him too. Im not shy haha  I ordered the chimichanga plate and told Dave to make sure it was covered in the hottest sauce, bring on the heat baby! I had the machaca beef and Dave said if you like heat get a side of green chile for your dish, so I did what he said, let me tell you it was good!! It wasn't the nose running, eyes covered in tears, lips burning on fire kind of kick I was looking for it, but it did bring a little tear to my eye (just want to say, I like heat, and though it wasnt hot to me, it might be to others) LOL it was very good, it comes with sour cream, which was good because it was a like a cool mild balance also the plate comes with beans & rice and have to say both were delish! I normally don't like rice but this was perfect!    Company, food, service was great! I look forward to coming back!    (side note: I checked into Arriba's last night, but it's not showing up on profile today but it does on my app,,,oh well.)"}
{"text":"Our team from work came here for lunch.  It is my first time!  After all these years, I finally made it inside for some food.  I selected off the lunch menu (quite a selection for lunch).  I ordered the Poco Pollo Con Queso.  It is a golden brown chicken chimichanga topped with two kinds of cheese.  It comes with rice and I got black beans.  YUM!  It was really good.  The refills are drinks were fast and you did not have to ask.  The only weird thing was they took our bowl for the chips away.  I thought they were refilling it, it never made it back to our table.    I agree with Jacob L. the deco was WAY over the top.  Almost touristy."}
{"text":"Arriba's is great. They have definitely changed management at this location, because a few years back it was awful, but the last 1-2 years it has been awesome. We make the decision to sit in the bar area, as service is almost guaranteed to be excellent.  The bartenders they have are both friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. We never have to wait for a refill on either a mixed drink or a soft drink.  Their happy hour is great, 1/2 priced apps. that are so filling you won't need a main entree! If you opt for one, split it, as it will be more than enough. Food quality is very good, and we always enjoy our time there.   Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"The white sands chimichanga is the best chimi I've ever had. Although the server was new, she was able to answer our questions and provided great service. Very friendly and happy staff."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Arriba a few times now.  I really don't care for their food, and service is slow more often than not.  The first time we went we were there it took a good two hours!  And that's not because we're slow eaters.  We did stop in for happy hour last week though, and although their margaritas aren't the greatest, they're decent enough!  They ofter a 12 oz. house margarita for .99 or a 24 oz. grande for 4.99.  Why people would pay five times as much for a marg twice the size, I don't know.  We each had three .99 margs, ate the chips, salsa and bean dip and our bill came to 5.94.  $6 and I left with a full stomach and a buzz.  Nice!"}
{"text":"We have not been disappointed with the food or service. We usually go here on Sundays because kids eat free with a paid adult. They have a huge selection of food. My favorite is actually the taco salad.  It comes on its own fried taco shell bowl. My kids get the mac and cheese or chicken strips and they are all good. I was a little skeptical about a chain restaurant. Their salsa is hot and margaritas are cold. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Nothing special... service is always sooooooooooooooooooo slow.  Every time I've been I've ended the meal by thinking to myself I wish I had gone anywhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch Tuesday afternoon. We made it in time for their lunch specials which end at 4:00 pm. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and taken to a booth in the back where it was quiet and next to a large fountain positioned inside the wall. Our menus were already on the table. Our waitress appeared and we ordered two waters. While she was getting those, a young man brought out fresh tortilla chips, spicy warm bean dip and salsa both very good. We asked our waitress what the $4.99 special was? It is two tacos with beans and rice. We ordered two of those specials. While we were noshing on the tortillas and dip, we were brought more. Our lunch specials arrived after about 20 minutes. The tacos were delicious with crunchy tortilla shells filled with ground meat, cheese and lettuce; the refried beans and rice were also good. Our waitress, hostess and bus help were friendly and nice. It has been years since we have ate at Arriba Mexican Grill. I am glad we chose them for lunch. We will return in the future."}
{"text":"We used to go there for lunch regularly but hadn't been there for a couple years, so it sounded good.  We were sat and after a little waiting and confusion about who our waiter was supposed to be we were brought chips and salsa and beans.  They were standard, okay.  I used to like this place because they had some spicy items, but zero spice in the salsa.  Should have asked for some hot sauce, which I think they used to automatically bring, but maybe not.  When ordering I asked if the green or the red burro was hotter.  I used to be a waiter in a Mexican restaurant and I realize neither is really hot, but sometimes one might have a little kick.  The waiter said the red, so I ordered that.  In the picture the lunch green/red burrito was enchilada style, so I thought mine would have the red sauce on top.  When he brought it out it was kind of a puny burrito and no sauce.  I asked about the topping and he said that was how it comes, but when I said the picture on the lunch special had enchilada sauce he was nonplussed and just said he could bring a side of the sauce if I'd like.  It's not the same when it's not baked on top with melted cheese so I said that it wouldn't be necessary.   Cutting into my burrito it was immediately apparent that it was a machaca burrito, not red chili.  It was lunch and I didn't have time for a re-do so I just ate it.  Server brought our check without clearing the table.  Also, the table was a bit dirty and one of the knives and a plate had schmeg on them.  All in all what I saw was a restaurant in decline, and badly in need of competent management.    I really hate giving bad reviews, so I'm hoping they read this and some of the other bad reviews that have been popping up and make some changes for the better.  Their hatch chili items are delicious, and there aren't too many Mexican places with good heat in their menu, so I really hope they work things out."}
{"text":"Very cute Mexican joint.  They bring you salsa and bean dip when you arrive.  (Later on that in a bit). Server was very nice and listened to all of our special request.  Lots of food and  served hot.  Chips are better than average Sour cream enchiladas were very good and so was shredded beef burrito .   Watch out though... boarding a flight isn't the ideal thing to do after this big girl Mexican splurge."}
{"text":"The food is always great but the service is generally blah. Great salsa. This is one of our goto's when we want chips salsa and bean dip. The bean dip is a little spicy and super yummy. The hot and regular salsas both have really good flavor and the drinks are delish too. They have a giant margarita for two!! Yum"}
{"text":"Kids eat free sundays. Thank you Arriba's. Pricey in the weekdays, but Sundays is definitely doable. Our kids only go for the claw machine in the lobby."}
{"text":"Once again, we were out and about, my mother-in-law and I, running errands.  Lunch time comes and we are always ready for a bite.  In the mood for Mexican?  Oh yea, I was.  So we headed to Arriba.  The server welcomed us with chips, salsa, and warm bean dip.  It was really good.  Gotta love a Mexican restaurant that serves bean dip on the house.  Thursday is chimi day.  Buck, ninety-nine for a chimichanga.  Such a deal.  I had mine with the green sauce (mild).  The chicken was shredded and very tender.   It was huge, but I ate the whole thing.   Oink.  Great place to grab a quickie meal."}
{"text":"Service was good but food was terrible. Went on Cinco De Mayo and expected great deals and amazing food, but was disappointed. Street tacos were 75% gristle and fat and the nachos appetizer was greasy and lousy. Not to mention they had very loud music playing where you couldn't hear those around you. I won't be going back, which is unfortunate because I had high hopes."}
{"text":"I want to thank the people at Arribas for accommodating our family. Was looking for someplace to go on Saturday night. Around six. Very busy time. Called ahead to see if there was a wait because we were coming with 2 kids and someone in a wheelchair we checked a few places closer to us first . Got there and they had everything ready for us. A high chair a sling for the baby and enough room for the person in the wheelchair. Food was great! Thank you for a nice evening"}
{"text":"Wife, friend and i visited this resturant the other day. We elected to sit on the patio. This was a mistake because we saw our waitress twice. We ordered an appetizer and it came out 1 min before the meal. The meal was mediocre at best. Friend and I had the white sands and my wife had the three cheese chimi. Overall this was not a good experience. My wife said it is not normal here but after my experience im hesitant to go back."}
{"text":"Had a deliiiiicious brunch this morning/afternoon at Arriba's Mexican. I'd not had anything off their brunch menu before so when our server, Michael (he is absolutely fabulous by the way!!!) brought us the menu, I was troubled having to select from the multitude of delicious dishes they offer. I opted for the South of the Border green chile tostadas which had guacamole, green chile, two over medium eggs on top, and tomato, cilantro fixings on top - I couldn't get enough of it (until of course I was stuffed!)! I added the beans and salsa before I squirted a bit of lime on top. Serious yum!!  They bring out chips, their in-house-made beans, and some salsa (they have several - be sure and ask your server) and they were delicious!! I enjoyed a margarita as well (was just in the mood) and it was a full 24oz so this not only quenched my thirst but had me pretty happy for the rest of my meal! They offer 1.99 bloodies for brunch however and I heard they were tasty. I'll have to try one next time. Ask for Michael if you want absolutely stellar service, excellent recommendations, and a unique flair ."}
{"text":"service was slow. food had no seasoning at all, very bland. better mexican food around."}
{"text":"My husband and I go there every other Friday for happy hour. Happy hour is from 3pm-7pm and 9pm- close on weekdays. All appetizers are 50% off and have margaritas for .99 cents! It's awesome! The food is great there too. The service is great and you usually don't have to wait to be seated because they are so proactive. We've been going there for 3 years so far and not once we been disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is expensive with poor food and service. Not very clean and not very cool.  They ripped me off on the guacamole and the sour cream   Both were 5.00 offered with the dish, the up charge was not disclosed."}
{"text":"My last visit was terrible. Served moldy tasting chips in a dirty bowl. The food and service has declined over the years. The wait staff made fun of a patron after they left. The Beef Enchilada had fatty pieces in it. I make better at home. Guess I will look for a New Mexican food place."}
{"text":"Experienced  A LOT better.  We decided to try it.  Rosa's, or Mango's are 100000 times better.  In regards to flavor.     The building is nice, but it does not make bland food.    If you want amazing Mexican food go to Rosa's or Mango's.  Skip the mainstream Mexican food and go to local \"mom and pop\" restaurants."}
{"text":"Its an ok Mexican restaurant with weak .99 margaritas for happy hour. I had carnitas and was not that impressed. Not that tasty and not much pork. All in all, it was ok...meh."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, made reservations for Mothers Day lunch were told we would be seated on patio which we requested. When we got there we were seated inside. Waited 20 minutes to order 1`hour to get the food which was average, service very slow told manager we were leaving and would pay up front he wanted us to wait at table for the bill  I told him no we were not going to wait another 20 mins to pay, so we made him ring us up. Not really any apology for anything. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"The good was okay and the margaritas were rather watered down and not very good. The service was good and the waitress was nice"}
{"text":"We we extremely disappointed this evening.  We sat st our table for over 20 minutes and no even served us water. Servers, only two in that area would walk by and didn't even acknowledge us, a party of three.   I would not recommend this place to anyone again."}
{"text":"We had a great meal and the service was great! Our server...I think her name was Alix...was excellent. Our food tasted delicious. Try the guacamole. It's really good."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Horrible management. Bad experience overall. Started off with the server asking what we wanted to drink, interrupting us to lean over to his other table to ask if they wanted more beers. Came back with our drinks and slammed them on the table and walked away without a word. He took our order like he was in a rush and when he came with the food he again slammed our plates down and left without a word. He never checked on us and I had to get up and go to the bar to ask for more napkins. We asked for the check and after waiting a good amount of time the server came up to ask us at least twice what each of us had to eat then disappeared confused. He even went to the table next to us who had already paid and picked up their checks to look through it seeing if he gave them ours. He came by our table and grabbed my card off the table and disappeared to the back again for a good amount of time but this time with my card. The manager (who was handling another complaint right by our table) came to our table as we were leaving and asked how it was. We were vague in saying our service was horrible and he didn't pry any further and didn't say sorry or any words at all. Not talking seems to be a trend at this establishment. Bad experience to say the least."}
{"text":"Great lunch or dinner spot. Been going here 30 years. Great for dates or family outings.  Carne asada tacos, Carnitas or any terestrial enchilada with green sauce is good. Fabulous margaritas, excellent service.  The manager often checks tables for happiness. Clown faces or balloons for kids Sundays too"}
{"text":"Just came to Arribas! Food was excellent as always! Drinks with the liquor I approve of. The message has gotten across to management here! Service was excellent and very prompt. The manager came by twice to ask if me and my girlfriends experience was efficient to our needs. Love Arribas. Always make a stop when I'm in phx area."}
{"text":"I'll start out with the negative so I can end on a positive note. We come here often and enjoy the food, very good service except.....if you get Joaquin as a waiter. Can't miss him, he has a bald head and always has his goatee braided in a little pig tail. We try to avoid him like the plague but my luck we get him more than we care to. He takes FOREVER to just come take your drink order, then longer to take your food order! This time I actually counted his tables (he had 4 tables with 2 people at each table). Unbelievable how long it took just to get a beer, margarita and 3 orders of mini chimichangas!   Well enough about Joaquin, as for the food all we order to eat are the mini chimis. Both the beef and chicken are great!!! Chips and salsa....I can't get enough!!! The hostesses are always on point and greet and seat you with quickness. I do like it that the restaurant manager makes rounds to see that everything is running smooth (have had to ask him for more chips and drink because Joaquin was being extra slow). Over all I gave it 4 stars, I thoroughly enjoy going here for cold drinks, chips and salsa and of course the mini chimis. I'd give it 5 stars if all of a sudden Joaquin went to work down the road, just sayin."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing experience that I have had as a diner.  Sunday night is \"children eat free, with a paid adult entree\".   My granddaughter, who is almost eight years old, and I sat for a good ten minutes before the waiter ever said anything to us, and then he only stopped long enough to tell us he was busy...AND he had a bad attitude!  So when he took my order, I asked for two single tacos for the child.  Oh but he could not do THAT! I had to order the child's meal and then order and pay for a second ala carte taco. so, okay, fine...whatever it takes, the only thing she would eat is the two tacos!!!!!! An hour later we were STILL waiting for those two damn tacos, and my simple entree! By this time the waiter's attitude had changed to contrite, and the manager was an ASS.  A second manager, and the waiter were far more conciliatory.  As far as I am concerned bringing a child to Arriba Mexican Grill on a Sunday night is a huge mistake, even if they do offer a \"Kids eat free\" come on."}
{"text":"Sometimes arriba Mexican Grill is excellent. This wasn't one of those days.  Went for happy hour the Arriba beer was very good. Hatch cheese crisp normally is good. I had to send it back it was not hot. Not spicy hot I mean it was almost cold. Must've been sitting a while before they brought it out to me.  The second one was very good extremely hot hatch chilies. Just had to wait a while for it to be cooked again.  Chips and salsa tasty  except salsa was Runny dripped all over my shirt.  Bean dip was not hot either chips were breaking in it.  overall not my best visit to Arriba. Too bad usually their happy hour is one of the best deals in town.  This is my first time at the Gilbert location"}
{"text":"House Margs are good cheap and big.  Just how I like my men."}
{"text":"Being on the Atkins diet it's hard to find something I really enjoy. I was pleasantly surprise with the taco salad.  I ask for no beans and tomatoes and had the most perfect meal. Come hungry because its huge."}
{"text":"We headed out here over the holiday break since we didn't want to cook and planned to see a movie close by.  There were a fair number of people inside, which we always take as a good sign.  Our server was very helpful in making decisions on what we wanted, and gave recommendations on things we may enjoy when we asked her thoughts.  Chips and salsa were brought out within minutes of being seated - be warned, you may want to fill up on these!  I choose to go with the Arriba Pollo Con Queso - described on the menu as \"An Arriba specialty. A giant golden brown chicken burrito topped with three kinds of melted cheese. Served with rice and charro beans.\"  It was delicious and I would order this again in a heart beat. I opted for sour cream and jalapeno cream cheese on the side, and both were excellent.  The jalapeno cream cheese normally comes in the burritos, and I'll most likely do that next time as well.  Overall: A Good choice for Mexican in Scottsdale. Chips and Salsa are addictive."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Good Mexican food and even better margaritas!! Every time I come, there is always great service as well which is an A+ in my book. Happy hour has some awesome deals. And then like I said for the margs, they're amazing. Get the big one. It is so worth it. I got Mango which was incredible. I thought it would be a weak drink but let me tell you I was wrong. Great drinks at great prices. Food is good too, I love everything I've tried so far. Haven't taken any pics cuz I'm always just focused on eating everything! Definitely recommend this place. I can't wait for the next time I'll be back! Oh and one more thing, we had Heather as our server tonight in the bar and she exceeded our expectations. On top of everything and just super friendly!! I hope we get her again :)"}
{"text":"Pros: Ambiance.  Cons: Definitely not the place for delicious Mexican cuisine. The wait staff is extremely slow in providing the bill."}
{"text":"There are so many choices for Mexican food in our neighborhood.  We've passed by this place more than once and finally decided to stop by and give it a try.  There is a lot of influence from New Mexico here and it's evident by the use of Hatch Chile in many of the menu items. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=jR0gwZgN7GK1O0Spel1N_g  After browsing the menu, we ordered:  Hatch Chile Cheese Crisp (Fried Tortilla topped w/melted Cheese & Hatch Chile)  White Sands Chimichanga (Spicy Pork Green Chile covered w/Queso Fundido) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=Ev2eduloh_wsuBGoRq9xDQ  The Hatch Chile Cheese Crisp was pretty good, but the Tortilla wasn't cooked all the way and was still soft....not crispy as it should be.  The White Sands Chimichanga was simply awesome!  The Queso Fundido made this dish taste soooo good.  The service was pretty good.  They have craft beer on tap and I wanted to sample some before I decided....the server brought out a few tasting glasses for me to try.  I thought that was cool. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=8pgTu034N-xFslG8NGjn7w  Overall, it was a decent experience.  I wasn't blown away by the food, but it is definitely worth coming back to try other items on the menu.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"We stopped in at the bar after a spring training game and decided to try these \"amazing\" margaritas everyone is raving about. I am not a tequila drinker so I ordered an IPA but what???? no IPA's!?! :(  They only have simple domestics and mexican inspired beers so I had a Pacifico in the bottle. My wife had the margarita and said it was average but for the happy hour price (she had a double so I'm not sure how much it was) she said it was so-so.  Our meals were pretty good for a standard mexican chain type joint but they charged for guacamole ($2.50) and sour cream (1.25) ? The place is definitely dated with the booths in the bar so small that it is very uncomfortable for 4 average sized guests to relax.  The one positive thing I can say is the service from Joe was very good. He did a great job with water refills and periodically stopping by the table."}
{"text":"Had the Pecos Chicken Enchiladas,  they were great.  As as that was the service was even better! We had a group of 12 and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here earlier today and was not impressed.  I was shocked to read reviews for the other locations in the Phoenix area but maybe the Glendale location just isn't up to par.  It is not bad in any way, but it is also not special either.  I did enjoy the three dips (chunky salsa-mild, chili salsa-hot and beans) and chips.  I also liked that the menu had a picture of each item so there wasn't going to be a surprise in that arena of the situation.  I ended up ordering an enchilada and two flautas.  They were average- nothing to write home about or to be angry about.  Just, eh, there.    Our waiter was attentive and brought us what we needed.  The decor is festive and bright.  Arriba seems to have some of the right things going for it, so I might have to return again to give it another chance."}
{"text":"One star for John our waiter. He was kind of boring but polite enough I guess. Let's start with the fact that we did NOT order drinks. They use the cheap stuff yet drinks are overpriced.  The nachos looked amazing on the menu so we decided to order them for starters. Well we snacked a little on them because I kept hoping the next bite would have some flavor. But nope. The meat was not seasoned at all.  My daughter ordered the chicken taco salad. They used bagged lettuce because the salad had carrot shreds in it.  She was saying the chicken tasted boiled but I laughed it off saying she was exaggerating. She was not because I went to look and take a bite and there was a piece of soggy nasty boiled chicken skin in it. She said the dressing tasted like Italian. I ordered the chimichangas. They again used boiled blan chicken and topped them with sliced cheese.  I have never been out to eat and asked to return the food I have ordered. It was that bad. Usually I will try my best to eat a little and leave it. But this food was not edible! I wouldn't go back there even if they owed free food! I'm pretty amazed they are even open for business."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Arriba's Mexican restaurant. Being from Albuquerque it is imperative to eat everything with green Chile's. That being said,  Arriba's delivers.   Spicy if you want. Great selection. Great service."}
{"text":"My dads favorite place And its mine too!  Customer service is really awesome and the food is really good!  A+"}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorites when we're in the area. Most food and drink items are very good.  Happy hour gives half off certain items.  Servers turn over frequently.  When you find a good one try and ask for them."}
{"text":"My bestie and I visited Arribas for Taco Tuesday!   We arrived around happy hour (3pm) and ordered the 12oz margaritas for $1.99 and the Tuesday special which is 2 tacos with a side of rice and beans for $5  The food was very good! The tacos were delicious and so was the rice and I'm usually one to be picky about my rice. The beans I didn't care to much for but prior to entree they serve chips with salsa and some sort of bean dip which I did love.    The margaritas were pretty strong and I normally drink strong liquor. After 2 12oz margaritas I felt buzzed already.   We sat at the bar section and it wasn't busy at all and servers walking around everywhere. Our server was sitting behind us in the booth talking to someone. She left our bill on the table when I still had a full glass of margarita left and still my platter on the table, I didn't appreciate that"}
{"text":"Great food nice employers  always a good experience have been eating here for years always a great experience"}
{"text":"Seated and forgotten on a Saturday night. Servers looking bored. How about, check you table? Jeez..."}
{"text":"This is my go to Mexican spot. I hate margaritas but always seem to order a margarita when I'm here. I love their spicy bean dip and always ask for the hot sauce over the chunky salsa. Their nachos are way too big for one person so I recommend sharing with the table. Wait staff are always personable and attentive."}
{"text":"went here for a business meeting the food was ok not great but i loved there queso cheese the services was great"}
{"text":"Good all around everyday Mexican restaurant. Not usually too packed. Get in fast, great service, they keep their eye on your drinks and appetizers. Would recommend to everyone looking for a good, quick dinner out on the town. Very close to Mall. Good central location just off that crazy Bell Road."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times always giving them another chance. But now I'm done dining here. Actually the bean dip first Served is great, the place looks nice and clean, the service is always good as well. What sucks is the food. Every time. No one is hardly ever in the place and that's why. Considering most kitchens havemexican cooks this is gross. You can tell it just sits in hot pans,nothing is fresh made. And they have tons of time to fresh make considering hardly any business. I had shrimp fajitas last night. A plate filled with hours old peppers and onions and just a few shrimp on top. And they weren't even seasoned good andjust a few. The rice was hard and gross. Get new management to get this kitchen cookingbetter. Until then, don't waste your time. It's really that bad. No pride in what is served."}
{"text":"Here from the east coast and this place was fantastic! Wonderful service and even better food!!!"}
{"text":"Placed an order on door dash. Order arrives and it's missing 1 of the 2 items I ordered. Called the restaurant and it was determined that door dash didn't submit the order correctly. The GM Blanca went above and beyond and had one of the managers deliver it to me. The food is great, but the service was incredibly appreciated on a day that was pretty rotten to start with. Thank you Blanca, your compassion means a lot."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice now and while the food is pretty decent, I can't get past the filthiness of the restaurant. Seriously, the owner needs to close down for a couple of days and deep clean this place.   It also didn't help that I found a hair in the chips.   Redeeming factor was that service was really good.   But still won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to Arriba today for my second time.  My first time for lunch and tried the $4.99 chicken chimi lunch special.  The service was good for the most.  Good salsa served with the chips.  Everything was good for the most part, Chimichanga was served with rice and beans.  Good enough flavor.  Nothing spectacular.  The Chimi was a bit smaller than it looked on the add and what I am used to seeing at other places(probably about the size of three tacquitos rolled together), but well worth five bucks.  Still I am not a fan of deception, speaking of which when I ordered I was asked if I wanted Sour Cream and Guacamole, which I thought was an offer not an upsell.  It ended up coming up to $2.25 together, nice job bumping up my bill by 50%.  Overall though I would return and just avoid the upsells.  The food is good, not great, but you will not find a whole lot better for $4.99."}
{"text":"Our waiter sucks. He is sitting down at another table while we ask other servers for service. Extremely rude and poor service. Took forever to get our order taken. I even took a pic of our waiter sitting at another table. Somebody els brought our food finally not even him."}
{"text":"There are so many outstanding AZ Mex, Tex Mex, and New Mex Mex restaurants in Phoenix. This just isn't one of them.  Everything here feels generic and mass produced, buffet or cafeteria style. Which is a shame, really, as the location is so prime and I have great memories of this place back when it was Tony Roma's. Does anyone else remember that?  Anyhow, it isn't wretched by any means, but in a city with so much outstanding Mexican influenced food everything else just falls away by the wayside."}
{"text":"I go to Arriba's Mexico Grill frequently and have always received great service however today I entered the establishment only to have not one but TWO employees walk past both my husband and I and we received no acknowledgment whatsoever while we waited to be seated for at least 10 minutes. It's really unfortunate because I had been raving about this restaurant and it was my husband's first time there. Needless to say you have lost not one but 3 customers because if this."}
{"text":"Tanya is the best server ever! We come here for birthdays a few times a year and she remembered us from last time. Chips and salsa and bean dip are unlimited, menu has good options too. I get the Chile con pollo every time, but the white sands chimi is my family's favorite. Really made my birthday feel special. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great menu, have yet to have any lackluster or bad food choices. The service (Andrea) is always top notch."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their happy hour Margaritas. And all the bean dip you can eat, it's hot too. The staff is always fast and friendly. I go out of my way to drive to the Camelback location."}
{"text":"Love all the Arriba's ! VERY good green chili, made with pork! White Sands chimi is to die for!"}
{"text":"Gave it an extra star for the atmosphere, I like the bar area it's open and relaxing.  Bad service, bad food and overpriced- drinks included.  Ordered the mini chimis and they are very dry and salty, your supposed to dip it in their flavored butter what ever it is that's not good.  I'd rather just get sour cream with it.  The margarita for two is huge, but got it over ice and that's what you get, ice.  Their food doesn't come close to anything that resembles mexican."}
{"text":"Tried the Pollo Con Queso Chimichangas yesterday for Cinco De Mayo. Incredibly good and also had one of the special margaritas. Service was great, food was impressive, and atmosphere was nice. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has potential...reminds me of Chi Chis.  That was a chain in the 80s and 90s.  I wanted Mexican food but wanted a sit down dinner.  It's national burrito day although I don't think they were celebrating.  I could have done New Mexican Grill, rubios or chipotle.  They all taste better.  Arribe was just average.  I asked for my burrito w hatch Chile sauce.  The tv commercial says hatch Chile's make it hot...but I think they forgot to put the sauce on or it wasn't hot at all.  It was tasty but salty.  Staff was pretty good.  Polite and attentive.  Atmosphere good.  Dessert menu looked good.  Serving size and prices good.    Don't think I'd venture back...would just stick to the counter service elsewhere.  But potential to be a 4 by \"freshening up\" food and menu."}
{"text":"Been eating here for three years. Probably ate here 20-25 times. The last few times things seemed to have been going downhill both food wise and service wise. The last time was, well, the last time. Waitress copped an attitude and service was uber-slow even though it wasn't busy. We noticed a lot of the staff standing around BS'ing with each other. food used to be pretty good, but no longer the case. We will have to find a new Mexican eatery."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the reviews here were spot on!  We were shopping nearby last night, figured have never been so we would try it....HUGH MISTAKE!  It was packed with a 20 min wait so figured maybe it is good...wrong!  The food is really terrible, stingy with the chips and salsa, lackluster service and attention to detail, dirty, and not a good value."}
{"text":"Was over in that area & it was rush hour so we decided to stop in for happy hour & dinner. Think it had been 10 years since we had been there not sure why. Service was very good, the margaritas were good & strong, chips, salsa, & queso dip were fine. Looking at the pictures of the food on their menu made me a bit cautious so I just had the beef taco plate. Rare to get hard shell tacos but they were very bland & the shredded beef had a very preservative taste; there are much better choices in this town."}
{"text":"this place is ok.  Big Margaritas.  Big New Mexico style burritos and food plates.  Not a bad place.  Nice bar.  It is always got people in the place and they brew their own beer..  Not the greatest, but its worth going to."}
{"text":"What keeps me coming back to Arribas is the fact that it's new Mexican  style.. hot. For a chain restaurant, this restaurant is one of my favorites. I prefer the arrowhead location because  that seem to have the freshest food. I love the white sands and hatch chili dishes."}
{"text":"Filled the void, but so does dog food... for a gringo, I can make better Mexican food!  Took a couple of photos and posted.  The margarita... Watered down, and it's National Margarita Day with no specials... And the customer service.... Eh!  Slightly better than the donkey show in Tijuana. Paid $68 for overpriced horrible food. Ordered the taco al carbon and carnitas.. More dry than the desert, not to mention the fillers rather than garnish.  Seriously, Taco Bell can do better!!! Now... I'm all about process improvement, so we mentioned the poor quality of the food and they give us a coupon for a free dessert.... WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I WANT TO RETURN!?  Left the coupon and leftovers... I wouldn't ruin my garbage can with their food! So... Now I'm at the grocery store getting stuff for my own margaritas on National Margarita Day...  Thanks GOD for the chips and salsa or else I would have left hungry.  My margarita.... 2 shots of silver tequila 1 shot triple sec 1 shot Grand Marnier 2 oz simple Limeade 1 juiced lime  Cost to make at least 30 of theses drinks; $30  The cost to leave this crappy review; PRICELESS!!"}
{"text":"Waste of time coming here for lunch!  Came in with three co-workers on our lunch break and service was horrific!  We immediately asked for extra bean dip.  Our waitress, Stephanie, took our drink order and said she'd be back to take our food orders even tho we were ready to order right then.  She proceeded to go behind the bar and make some drinks and ring some orders and check on other customers.  She finally came back with our drinks but no bean dip.  We waited and waited and waited for her to come take our orders and finally had to ask to get someone else to serve us.  This turned out to be the manager.  We had ordered four lunch specials and one to go.  After waiting some more she came back and said we could get the to go order only at full price so we declined.  We finally got more chips and salsa from our original waitress who brought two of everything even attitude.  By this time we had been waiting for at least 30 min since the manager had supposedly put our order in.  We got up and asked for the manager again since at this point we were running late for work.  She's nowhere to be found until we get up to leave.  She comes out with our food as we're half way out the door saying \"they tried their best\"!  No apology.  She offered to box it up but for what full price since the special is full price to go!? No thanks cuz they probably spit in it anyway!"}
{"text":"Really really bad. I had the tacos the steak was just gristle. BF had the fajita quesadilla he said there was nothing good at all. Both beers on tap were sour and weak- even the bock. I've never written a bad review but people need to know. Don't waist your money on higher priced bad food"}
{"text":"Interesting menu!  Many items feature the Hatch chile, which is a formidable bit of hotness that you can even purchase to take home with you (wear gloves.)  Decor is festive, music is wonderfully authentic and the place is usually jumping with customers around lunchtime and dinnertime.  I had the New Mexico Enchiladas and they rocked my world.  This is a nice blend of authentic and creative approaches to traditional dishes that never get too ritzy or complex.  Margaritas were super and service was superb.  I haven't been brave enough to try a \"three hatch\" entree' yet (their rating system of peppers skews low - one hatch will fire you up) but that's certainly going to be next!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed - I suggested this place to our group of 10, and the service was so slow, we thought about getting up and leaving - which we should have done. Atmosphere was quiet and not at all joyful or exciting. No music was playing.  Nick was our waiter - was this his 1st day on the job?  He was not prepared or able to handle a table of 10, plus his other tables. We blame management for this.  We arrived about 5pm and the place was empty.  Our drink orders took 4ever.  Our food was dropped off on 2 large platters next to our table, and it took 5 MINUTES for someone to come and deliver our food.  It was cold by then.  Very sad - this used to be our go-to place for Mexican food - no more!"}
{"text":"Thank you God for this place.  I was starving from a very long drive from the Grand Canyon to Phoenix and was craving an enchilada.  I googled mexi-whatever cuisine somewhat near the airport and came up with Arriba.  This is a chain restaurant, so the decor/service are all acceptable.  The hostess sat us immediately and our server took our orders.  I love the unlimited chips & salsa that come with every meal.  The salsa was surprisngly good!  I ordered the rio grande enchilada with pulled pork (they call it something else, i forget).  I was delicious!  I'm actually surprised it was a bit spicey.  Normal tex-mex food here in Boston is not spicy at all, so I guess I wasn't prepared.  I ate the whole thing, but passed on the rice and beans.  That's just not my thing.  Overall, 4 stars!  Ole!"}
{"text":"I use to come here quite often for their happy hour. 99 cent margaritas and half off all appetizers. How awesome is that?! All that and comes with chips and salsa and bean dip, which the dip is really good. I stopped coming because my boyfriend got food poisoning from this place. (our thought is its from the salsa, because it's the only thing I didn't eat and he did)   Well anyways, we came back last night with some friends and I ordered a 99 margarita. It was hard. Our waiter kept trying to get me to order the $8 margarita because the 99 cent one is watery and has like no alcohol in it. I don't care! It's 99 cents and I'm a lightweight anyways, so just give me that dang margarita. Then we came to ordering. Now let's keep in mind we had dinner and we came around 930 at night. We ordered beef chimis and a cheese crisp to share. Our waiter said, that's it? In a 'really, Wow' tone. Alright... He says, and leaves us.   He just wanted us to buy more in the end and make us feel bad about getting just happy hour. I'm sorry, but if you don't want people ordering 99 cent margaritas, then don't have it on your menu."}
{"text":"Honestly I am so disappointed. I went here last night for my 21st birthday and it was absolutely terrible. There was 9 of us and it took 15 minutes to even get a server over to our table. After she finally got there we ordered drinks which took a very long time to get to the table which is understandable because it was 8 margaritas.. however she left without taking our order and we were there for awhile waiting on her... when our food came out (we just ordered apps) it was good but our queso fundido did not come out and when it did it was 10 minutes after the rest of the food and it was COLD. Ugh and then she did not bring chips for the queso so we had nothing to eat it with except for the chips from our nachos. That was the last time we saw our server... no drink refills, nothing. And then after being there for roughly 2 hours with no service we actually had to grab another server to get our check because our server was literally no one to be found. We all thought she had left. Anyway... we get the check and we're over charged and yet again our server is no where to be seen. So sad that our server treated us so poorly... especially on my 21st bday."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. If you want a bean burrito definitely do not order the Sierra Mixed burrito.  Though it says it contains beans, it does not. Set scene: five seconds after we sat down with our faces buried in menus our waiter Joaquin asks if we are ready to order. My friend tells him no, this is our first time here so we need a few minutes. He explains that the spicy dishes have one, two or three peppers next to them to signify the levels of heat (duh). So he leaves for a while, comes back and takes our order. We got the chimichanga plate, taco salad, kids bean and cheese burrito and the Sierra mixed burrito. For the chimichanga we were asked red or green sauce and for the Sierra mixed burrito we were asked red or green chile. So about a half hour later (mind you this was 8pm on a Tuesday, not busy at all) we get our plates. The salad was good, the chimichanga was meh, the kid seemed to like her bean and cheese burrito but when my friend took a bite of the Sierra mixed burrito a look of pure disgust fell upon her face. She opened the burrito and what appeared to be wet canned alpo covered in red sauce fell onto the plate. No beans. Just \"beef\". Now I realize many may recognize chile as meat but all the other burrito type  items on the menu clearly state chicken beef or pork. Also as I mentioned we told the waiter we had never been there before so he could have specified that the burrito is nothing like the menu describes (no beans). When he came to check on us my friend said umm did I read this wrong, it has meat and no beans???  This is where Joaquin's customer service skills really shined. He laughed and said well I asked you if you wanted red chile or green chile. Then he told us this happens all the time and it clearly states on the menu your choice of meat. Well, the menu also clearly states that it comes with beans and that isn't the case. \"Sierra Mixed Burrito- giant soft flour tortilla stuffed with beans and your choice of red or green chile. Served with rice and your choice of beans\". Lies. No mention of alpo at all. Here's a thought Arriba, maybe if this happens all the time you should change your verbiage on the menu instead of insulting and arguing with your customers. So my friend sent the burrito back and opted not to get anything else. Joaquin ignored us for the duration of our stay until he brought us our check after we had been sitting there not eating for about 20 minutes. We flagged down the manager because we didn't know if we were suppose to pay up front or at the table. At that point the manager was apologetic about the burrito but still argued that the menu is clear on what it contains (no beans). Obviously the manager knew about the burrito incident but at no point decided to come to our table and see if there was anything he could do. All in all this place sucks. We are new to Glendale and were looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant like they have in Salem, Oregon (props La Hacienda). So to sum it up, if you want shitty service and mystery menu items you should definitely go to Arribas. Otherwise go to Chili's, it's way better."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed after insisting we had to go here. Chips were stale and sent back twice. No refill on ice tea. Order was improperly served to table. Taste was way below the standard we are used to there. Our server had a horrible attitude. Spoke to manager on the way out and his response was: what would you like me to so about it? I was floored. Very rude and probably will not return."}
{"text":"First time ever going and we were sat at a table for 12 minutes without anyone ever greeting us. As we were walking out we told the hostess no one ever came to help us so we were leaving she responded very sarcastic \"okay have a great day\". Won't go back."}
{"text":"As you can expect with Arribas. Lots of free chips and bean dip. Generous portions. Prices are fair. Not the fanciest restaurant but the ambiance is nice and the waiter was helpful. Left full and happy."}
{"text":"Margaritas need more flavor but generous In size. Tortilla soup was great. Roswell tacos need different toppings to give it more substance/ flavor. Price. Good. Not like CA Mexican I am used to but definitely have the soup."}
{"text":"Arriba's has good chips and salsa but they only bring their hot salsa upon request. Try the fajita quesadilla for a spicy lunch. Watch out for the upsell for a small sour cream or gauc. Service can be slow no matter how busy they are."}
{"text":"Was a big fan until yesterday. Hot sauce used to be the best, now just tasted like tomato sauce. Food was awful, they're only excuse was that they are training new chefs. Sadly, we will not go back."}
{"text":"Good, cheap place to grab more Americanized Mexican dishes here in Phoenix. I would really recommend coming here for some tapas and margaritas.   Food was great, like it typically is. I really like this place.  Big, cheap margaritas as well. This place would be a good place to stop if you were in Phoenix on a vacation or something like that."}
{"text":"Love the margarita!!!! The bartender ((EVAN)) is awesome!! Super chill, great customer service and makes good drinks!! I love my food!! I got the Pecos sour cream enchilada and it's delicious! Big portions! So I'm sure I'll be having left overs later!! 2nd time coming back and I had great experience both times so I knew I had to write a review!!!"}
{"text":"We love going to Arribas with our two young girls.  Kids eat free on Sunday's so it's especially helpful for a family on a budget.  We just wish the service was a little better - it seems as though they are short staffed most of the time.  It's a shame, because we LOVE the food.  I would definitely recommend to take your family here for a great meal, I just wish they had a little more help (servers).  The margaritas are delicious!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to have a beer while I waited on an oil change. I sat at the bar, during lunch, where five other people were sitting. I requested chips and salsa to eat. Those were your standard Mexican food restaurant chips and salsa so not bad but nothing special. The bar had Bud Light and Dos Equis on draft so I went with XX. The bartender first poured the beer into a shaker then, poured the beer into a cold mug. After that, I saw him do the same with a Bud Light but instead of pouring the beer into the mug, he went to the freezer, where their bottled beers are and grabbed a pitcher and poured the guy's beer from there. He then poured the beer from the shaker into the pitcher. I asked the bartender why and he explained their draft lines were all messed up and the beer was too foamy. I guess that explains why my beer was so flat. There are plenty of other bar options in the area. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best service ever. Excellent happy hour. Very relaxing atmosphere and the manager tonight was more than exceptional!!! We will now make this our regular happy hour location."}
{"text":"I dig the food but not so much the prices. I really don't think you get what you pay for. I've been a lil dissappointed the last couple times I went, as the service was slow (which isn't necessarily the waiter/waitresses fault, could have been the kitchen) and my food wasn't exactly hot, but warm. The bean dip for the chips was cold and my food was mediocre.  I've only been to this location and another in Ahwatukee and I'd say I've had better experiences at the -Tukee location overall.   When we arrived to our seat the table was dirty and we asked if we could be reseated somewhere else, but the lady advised us to take a seat as she came back with a rag and wiped it down while we were there, and pieces of lettuce fell in my lap. Thanks lady, wasn't really looking to save those for my granish on my 'future' meal, just saying.   There isn't too many Mexican food places, on this side of town, so when you're looking for a sit down this is one of few options, but it's a toss up at this point if I'll stick around or opt out for a meal here again."}
{"text":"Good food. You won't be disappointed.  Servers are usually attentive.  Good place for out of towners not familiar with Mexican food. Portions are large enough that you usually need a take home box.  Good margaritas and brew.  Just a little too corporate for my liking."}
{"text":"After church today, my sister and I were treated to lunch/dinner by my mom. Earlier, I had taken a bit of a tumble down the church steps, and figured going home and acting like a baby about it didn't seem like the best thing to do. So I just hobbled my hungry self into the restaurant.   We were sat by the bar. Kind of dark in this place. Little League World Series was on yet again. These restaurants must know I'm coming or something...I sense a conspiracy.  Our waiter was great, and way too young to be \"looking\" at me in the way that he was. My mom and sister found it hilarious that he was practically stumbling over his words whenever he came to the table. I still think it was all in their heads, and he was just being friendly and great at his job. The food wasn't too shabby either. Their portions are extremely huge, so I had to take about half of my chimichanga home (I just polished it off about an hour ago, even tastier than it was at the restaurant).  Will I come back during happy hour one day in the future? Probably, you sure can't beat a 99 cent margarita. Although the high food prices and the deadly cleaner they use (Seriously, my eyes teared up and I coughed really hard after unintentionally inhaling its fumes!) may make me consider otherwise."}
{"text":"After a exhausting day at work i decided to try this place out and it was pretty good. Nice setting food came out great i got the steak/chicken fajitas with rice and beans .. waiter was cool too checked in frequently without being overbearing.. got to try out their spicy  peppers on the side was a good experience.. would def come here again"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant,this place has some pretty good Mexican food!   I typically shy away from chain restaurants when it comes to Mexican food, because we all know you find some of the best Mexican food in a dive!  However, I've been to Arriba's several times and I've never been disappointed.  I love their chimichangas with green sauce and pork!  The chips and salsa are pretty good and the margaritas are excellent!"}
{"text":"Love the bean dip and cheese crisp the margaritas for good very affordable at happy hour"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Nice Mexican place that seems to cater to parties and partiers.  Great big menu full of pictures, tons of cheese on most items, bean dip with the salsas, and micro-brews on site.  Chips and guac were simply standard.  Salsas were standard too.  Bean dip was an interesting touch.  My server was very good...well above average (Ashley)."}
{"text":"great food!!! amazing service! This is a really authentic Mexican food restaurant it has really good micheladas and their food is also very tasty and fresh ingredients you can taste."}
{"text":"Food was great, our server Michael was amazing. Front of house and the front manager are very rude and seemed to not really care about the customer"}
{"text":"Hard to find decent Mexican on Sunday's in far SE Valley without driving a bit. Been here several times. Kids eat free on Sunday's but it's a little gimmicky. Good flavor though especially if you like the New Mexican style. Service is decent but sometimes there's a wait to be seated. Wish the staff acted more like they wanted to be there. Place is starting to feel more dirty/rundown every time I come. I think it's the weird indoor waterfall humidity. Chips and Salsa is great. But I always leave feeling like I ate a brick. Food was a little runny/thin this time. Have to be back. Not much else around."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately & our waiter César was very attentive.  My sister & I wanted to share a plate. We ordered the Pollo Con Queso. It was my first time having this dish. It is so good! Overall experience was great!"}
{"text":"2 stars is a stretch!!  I got an enchilada and taco plate.  How do you mess up a taco?  Yep couldn't eat it.  Charro beans not done.  Bathroom smelled in front as you come in.  Didn't pay attention but should have.  Should have left.   Beware."}
{"text":"Chips and Salsa + our server Monica acquired these two stars.  Both were fantastic.   I ordered ground beef tacos and my girlfriend ordered beef floutas.  The beef in both dishes was remarkably bland. I question if it was seasoned at all.   Although, for $40 for the chips and salsa, 1 margarita, 1 beer, 1 soda and 2 entrees... that's a fair price point.   Will not be revisiting."}
{"text":"You like spicy? No seriously. Flavor, heat, fantastic!  The service left us flat, it was the bartender working a table routine. He forgot our appetizer, forgot our drink refill request... You would think after twice getting up walking across the bar to request what he already forgot to bring us would have embarrassed him into better service, or not.  The food was very good.  Even the bean dip and salsa they give you with the chips had some zip on it.  Normally the gratuitous salsa is pretty lame to appease the masses.  Here the masses must like it hot.  If I ever get out to Phoenix again I'll be back, but I don't think I'll take a table in the bar area."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have very much selection they should change the name to just different kinds of enchiladas they're very high-priced for very low cost things I wouldn't recommend to come here and I've been there one time and that's enough for me"}
{"text":"What has happened to this restaurant. Several years ago when this place opened in Goodyear the food was served hot and was very tasty. Since then my husband and I have gone back several times to be served cool/heat lamp warm food. Several of the servers don't seem happy to be working and waiting for a refill of chips or a beverage can take a while.  Not sure who is managing this place but you would hope that they see these negative reviews on Yelp and work to make improvements."}
{"text":"The food is kinda mediocre and the servers always seem like they are trying to be good but they just really, really dislike their jobs. I don't blame them. The turnover is constant, the place has an empty, depressing feeling.  We've tried it several times but no more.."}
{"text":"I have so far ate at two locations of Arriba in the Phoenix area. Not sure why this has lower ratings. The food was just the same at both, the service was definitely more prompt here! Everything came out in a timely manner never felt rushed or neglected and they have great margarita specials and reverse happy hour. I think the white queso is some of the best I have had in AZ and I always enjoy the Trio Special as a meal!"}
{"text":"Cultureless chain restaurant with bland food. Employees are more interested in flirting with each other at the host stand than to acknowledge you when you walk in or walk out."}
{"text":"Thursday night. We have been working on our new house all day. I think to myself \"Haven't been to Aribba in a while\" so we go. Host sat us I'm bar section-no complaints about that-closer to the drinks!  Fifteen minutes into our visit, I remember why. At that point, we still were waiting for someone to come take a drink order and give us chips and salsa.   While perusing the menu, I note one thing that is always super annoying to me at this Arriba location. There is NO drink menu. Stupid. Finally get our drink order and chips and it's easily another 10 before she's back to take order. She gave the kiddo his soda and us our water-still no Bud Light and house margarita. Good came in decent amt of time, served by another server. She was prompt responding to our request for more chips. Other than that, we saw our server (who was also bartender apparently) a grand total of 5 times even though we had empty drinks and the need for additional napkins. We saw her more walking past our table than we did AT it. BTW, the place was at least half empty when we arrived. And while we had no issue with sitting in bar area, I did overhear another party comment that they were surprised to sit in bar. The host response was, \"This is a section and we have to sit people here\". If you truly have such hard and fast rules in a food service joint, you are certain to upset customers. Anyway, the rest of our dinner was equally slow. My food was so unmemorable I hardly remember what I had. Not bad. Not good. But the service was pretty freakin bad and therefore, I will patronize other better Mexican places in the Tuk on the few occasions the mood strikes."}
{"text":"We go to Arriba every few weeks and really enjoy it.  The food is always good, the servers & bartenders are friendly, and our food comes out incredibly quickly.  Not quite sure why the reviews are so iffy - it's our go to Mexican restaurant in town."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants. We love their adobada. We like Serano's machaca plate too, but this is juicer and more spicy.  The service we had today was great. We came in at 4:00 on a Saturday. Dorothy was our server, and she's very nice and attentive. The manager came over twice to check on us. I think his name was Francisco. It wasn't too busy because we missed the dinner crowd. We mentioned to him that we thought three reviews on here did not do the place justice, and he gave us a dessert card! Come try it. We will be back for sure, maybe for our next run to Costco."}
{"text":"While the food isn't bad, I cannot believe the bad service.  From the bartenderess (Saturday, July 11th, 10:43pm) who could not wait to get out and go home, so much so, she packed my order to go when I never mentioned \"to go\".  I wanted it hot and fresh; I got it home, cold and microwaved.  And then there's the voicemail to corporate that to this day goes unreturned.  Well, four days later I did get a call, \"broken vm\" he said.   And then there's the completely disinterested operator at Arriba Corporate, like she was doing me a favor.  Hey, honey, I got at least 2568 Mexican retaurants left without Arriba.  Last, the \"contact us\" form on Arriba's website doesn't function.  If you fill it out, enter the code that makes sure your a human, it always returns as incorrect code. DO YOU THINK THEY GET LESS COMPLAINTS WHEN NO ONE CAN CONTACT THEM?  I DO.  The food is good. But do you know that with the exception of the bartender who greeted me, there was a complete lack, void, dearth of hospitality. If I gave away a medal if make doubly certain things went well. The manager on duty, who was better dressed for sleep than managing, she acted like she was paying for my meal out of her own pocket!  Not a word. Not, \"thanks\" not nothing!  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE experience. Oh, and by the way: this place has been painted and repainted but it cannot take out the dank smell and the age of this dump.  Go anywhere else, Mi Patio, anywhere, just not here."}
{"text":"The service was prompt...the food hot...the beer cold....the price was within reason....any questions??"}
{"text":"The food was average at best.  I got the ground beef burrito and it was good but not great and had a odd flavor to it. This is definitely more of a Tex-Mex food fare.  Don't believe I'll be coming back again as there are much better places in Scottsdale for Mexican dining."}
{"text":"Pollo con queso is ridiculous! Huge menu. Also try the white sands sauce."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at the Goodyear store . It was 47 minutes to get served ,Guess the manager was upset because I did not want to set at the bar if I wanted to set at a bar I would go to a bar . I will never step foot in a arriba agian and I will bad mouth them on all the sites I belong to."}
{"text":"Was greeted not by hello.. but \"it will be about 10 minutes\" ummm we didn't even say why we're here. Just wanted to relax on the patio on a Friday afternoon.   Very slow service, then got our orders wrong. Icky margarita. The waitress seemed annoyed we were there. Drinks were nothing special.   Lunch special consisted of a little chunk of fish buried under sour cream and cabbage. Chips and salsa were ok. All in all, nothing I would rave about. Honestly Some Burros up the street is just as good!!   Get some customer service and this place might be ok..."}
{"text":"Mmmmm the food was so good! The chips, salsa and bean dip provided in the beginning were plentiful and replenished without even having to ask for it! That's a big plus because a lot of places almost seem reluctant to give you more chips and salsa.   I had the two enchilada plate. The lettuce and tomato salad that came on it seemed fresher than other places, and the rice was good (no beans for me). I went with a party of 7 and everyone else's dishes looked very good and there were definitely no complaints from anyone!  It was my niece's birthday, and the servers all assembled and sang happy birthday with a big sundae for the birthday girl. Our server was named Caesar, and he did a great job. So the service was top-notch!  I'll definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for tasteless Mexican this is your place.  Besides no flavor, the dishes don't come with any garnishes such as sour cream or guacamole. I had a chicken tostada except there was barely any chicken and was about five inches in diameter. My husband had a Chile Relleno and Two Tostittos plus a coke. No rice or beans and our bill was $28!"}
{"text":"if you want delicious americanized mexican, colon cancer causing food, then come here. if you want authentic, go to mexico.  no but really. they have ridiculous sized margaritas and martinis.  i really think that's what they should be called. \"RIDICULOUS SIZED\" it's like \"may i please have the gallon sized cosmo? yes by myself. yes thank you i'll need a cab.\"  i love the abodaba pizza and the pollo con queso.  been coming here for years and i still love it."}
{"text":"Welp...i actually have eaten at other locations and absolutely hated the food and service. Haven't been back to an Arriba's in probably close to four years or so thats how disgusting and horrible i thought the food was everytime i went. Very hesitant on coming here especially on Christmas for dinner, but since it was literally the only place open in the area i decided to go for it. Surprisingly,  our server was awseome and super friendly and my meal was excellent. Couldn't believe it. Not sure if it was just this location or what the deal was but i will probably only eat at this location if i eat at Arribas again."}
{"text":"A Robert Irvine attitude adjustment for the wait staff and kitchen help needed immediately!!   I was so excited to bring my boyfriend here as Arriba caters for the company I work for and the food had been great.   When we arrived we were asked to sit in the cantina area. While it was colorful and inviting, the service and food was dreadful.   First, let me start by saying it took 15 minutes to get our appetizer. We ordered the queso and upon arrival it was cold and the layer of cheese had already started to crust.   While we were eating out appetizer, the waitress finally decided to take our food order. It took another 30 minutes to get our food. I had the carnitas. The meat was burned to a crisp. The waitress did, after 25 minutes, inform us that the kitchen was backed up. We counted less then 6 tables. Hmmm .. maybe she forgot the order and had to hit the RAIL button.  Now, let me take a step back and mention that it took our waitress quite some time to get our drink order (water and sprite). I asked for a straw (I just started invisalign and my teeth are a bit sensitive) and she never brought one. I am glad it provided my boyfriend a chivalrous moment to hand over his straw.   Hopefully I can figure out a way to attach a photo, but the entire time we were dining we had the pleasure of looking at four tables that had not been cleaned. We should have got the hint to leave when the table in front of us got up and left a full meal.  As the meal came to an end, the manager did stop by and ask us how everything was. We did mention the delay in getting our food (we didn't mention the burned food although we probably should have), and so he felt obligated to comp a portion of our food. He 'graciously' provided us with the employee discount. Instead of a $47 check it was $39. Thanks buddy!   Needless to say, we wont be going back."}
{"text":"Best margaritas I have ever had. Never had a bad meal here as many times as we've dined here. By far our favorite Mexican place."}
{"text":"Soooooo disgusting!  Drove past this morning (Mother's Day) and noticed there were some cars in the parking lot.  Tried to find breakfast elsewhere but the lines were so long that we ended up giving them a shot. Turns out they have weekend brunch and today was a Mother's Day buffet.  They were booked up solid from reservations so we thought it had to be good.  Since it was just 2 of us they said we could sit in the bar.  Waitress was rude and seemed annoyed by having to help us.  It was just my teenage daughter and myself, but my daughter asked for a Coke and the waitress was so rude when she said they don't have coke and told my daughter Pepsi would have to do.  Ummkay.    Buffet food was absolutely nasty!  French toast was liquid in the middle, eggs were fake tasting, bacon was rubbery and tasted rotten and I don't even know what other food was being served, it looked gross and wasn't labeled.  It was very obvious this place serves the absolute lowest quality food possible and didn't want to waste anything so they were leaving food out all long as possible.    We ate a few bites of food and asked for the bill.  Paid $30 plus tip for 2 people to eat a few bites of gross food.  Such a huge waste of money, I wish I had complained in person but I wanted to leave so badly I just paid and left.  My stomach does not feel well at all after those few bites, I'm pretty sure had I eaten more I'd be regretting it."}
{"text":"The good:  We were seated immediately and served chips, salsa and bean dip.  The salsa was mild, so my husband requested a hotter version and was pleased with \"the kick\", which says a lot because he keeps a small bottle of ghost-pepper hot sauce in his car and has a tongue made of steel.  The bad:  We ate chips and salsa...and ate chips and salsa....and ate chips and salsa....without getting served water or seeing a waitress.  At one point, I asked for a drink menu, and they did not have one. I know they serve margaritas, but usually restaurants provide numerous options and have a menu describing those options.  Supposedly Arriba's used to have a menu  but no longer does - so even though you see people drinking out of awesomely huge margarita cups, there is no way to look up the price.  Finally the waitress came to the table and apologized for the fact that no one ever told her we were there.   It was 5:30pm on a Saturday evening.  Back to the good:  Our food arrived quickly.  The portion sizes were large. It was everything you would expect from Mexican food: tortillas, cheese, beans, meats with sour cream, marked up to $10/plate.  But it was a tasty $10 plate of food and my family left very full, slightly bloated, and with a white plastic box of filled of cheesy leftovers that my husband will eat tomorrow for lunch while i detox with a salad."}
{"text":"Place is going downhill.  For years I've been coming here I've noticed a degradation in service within the general dining area to the point that I usually sit in the bar area as the people there seem to get service.     Until today.    Example from today. service  here was very poor. Ignored our request of seating, make it seem like it's an imposition when we mention it. It's ok we can wait.  Then server forget the beer till food arrived,then forget the hatch side for a while leaving me  an under fired meal for most of it, yeah I like it going cold.  Many of us used to go here for lunch as I work nearby but the place is practically impossible to get a group to now as one of the checks isn't right or an order is missed.  It's food has been consistently good and since I am a heat junkie it's the nearest New Mex place to my work an obvious choice.  A choice that's getting harder to justify with days like this."}
{"text":"We are both Ariba's fans but have always gone to the Camelback location. First time at this location. Food was bland and over done.  Kind of think it sat under a heat lamp for a while. Tortillas were tough and dried out. I do like the bean dip. Probably will stick with the Camelback location. Never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"Failure beyond epic. We waited ten minutes for a table for lunch. People in front of us gave up. Finally seated and we figured the hard part was over. After ten minutes without anybody coming to our table (yes, now at 20 minutes)we began to worry. People at adjoining tables were unhappy and asked for their food in a box to go because they were out of time. We have up and left. Can't speak to the good, but I can certainly say that the service was deplorable. Or worse."}
{"text":"Desperate to have some mexican food within the area I was at, I decided to stop by arribas mexican grill. At first glance, you can automatically tell that this will be some white washed mexican food. Greeting you at the front door are some girls that look like they just stepped out of their shift from the corner strip joint. The service is lousy. No one ever came to serve us. We waited and waited... a total of 15 minutes. Bye idiots! Never again."}
{"text":"Ugh. They have some good commercials for this place currently playing. Unfortunately...that's where the \"good\" stops with this place! Everything was terrible from the service to their food, I think their Diet Coke even tasted horrid. We ordered their Mexican Waffle with ice cream..they actually made Eggo's taste good, which is not saying much. Frost bitten and just ewww. If a 6 yr. old doesnt want dessert...something's wrong with your place.   I will NEVER go here again and if this saves even one person from eating here, I feel I've done my job. Do yourself a favor and don't go here, it's disgusting."}
{"text":"This horrible food. Ordered to go. Chicken fajita salad was dry, asked for an order of tacos we received one. Beans tasted like canned beans. The cheese inside the enchilada was not melted all the way. All for $50. Don't bother. Taco bell is better."}
{"text":"OK...but why are people flocking in here like it's the best Mexican they have ever had?  Maybe it is for them, but I've surely had better.   Ordered the fajitas.  That was an experience:  I don't think I've ever had meat cut into different sizes like that before when I ordered fajitas. They were ok, tho. The hard sour cream that sat in a clump (what happened to soft, creamy sour cream?), the watery guacamole, the sloppy cut fajita meat that needed more spicing and definitely needed a better grade of skirt steak all added up to a big, fat meh from me. Meh."}
{"text":"We keep trying to give this spot a chance but now we are DONE trying and will never eat here again. Our waitress constantly has attitude with other employees and customers. (Not the first time this has happened) the table next to us complained about cold food and beans that were not warmed up and she re made the dish for the lady. When our food came out (while waiting for a refill for over 10 minutes) our beans tasted horrible like someone in the kitchen purposely did something to them that wasn't normal (spit, vinegar, something metallic tasting) I'll never give this place a chance again. First time in years I haven't left at least a 20% tip. The sad thing is they don't change their staff no matter how rude these girls are. No one should scoff at you if you ask for a refill. No one should bash other customers 10 feet away where everyone can here. Blah, not coming back."}
{"text":"PRO: 1. Good food - Menu has enough variety to keep things interesting 2. Margaritas are BIG - They aren't going to blow your hair back or anything, but they are good.  3. Friendly staff when I have visited. 4. To Go service is quick and cheap. In and out without a hassle.  CONS:  1. Slow service, had to ask for the check twice...never good. 2. The ambiance is a little 'cheesy' and the music can be loud.  All in all, it's a nice sit-down Mexican food chain. You can get better Mexican/tex-mex food in the valley, but this is good for the price."}
{"text":"Just okay.  Stopped by for their reverse happy hour.  Salsa was good. Kind of spicy for mild which I liked.  Disappointed that the bean dip AND the queso had chorizo.   We split the Mexican pizza subbing the meat for beans. Greasy but satisfying. It's good if you put tons of salsa on it. About halfway through eating it however, I detected something meaty in their beans. Now, I am not a super strict vegetarian. I will eat refried beans at most Mexican places as long as there is not an overwhelming lard or meaty taste. (On a side note though- I feel it is completely unnecessary to use lard or meat products in beans. My favorite Mexican food place- Mi Pueblo- makes excellent beans with no lard. When beans are a vegetarian staple, why would a restaurant be inconsiderate and make it non-vegetarian? Okay- end rant.) So back to Arriba's beans... It tasted something a bit porkish. It kind of killed my appetite so I was done after two pieces.  My husband also ordered pork taquitos which he was underwhelmed by. Although a big chorizo fan, he said the queso it came with wasn't great.  Our server was good. Charming and accommodating.  But what really turned me off was the bill. My husband didn't tell me until we were in the car, so I didn't have a chance to fight it. $31 total. Hmmmm... happy hour prices on the Mexican pizza should have been $8 and $3. On top of that a draft Bud Light (also on special) and a Corona. $31 does NOT make sense. Our server didn't seem so charming and accommodating anymore.   Yeah, so we won't be back. Way too many good Mexican places to bother with Arriba."}
{"text":"Great meal & service from our server Raul & manager Ivon.....just rediscovered the new Arriba on Pima"}
{"text":"Arriba's Mexican Grill is probably one of my least favorite places to go for Mexican. I am compiling a list of the best chips and salsa in Phoenix. I personally think that the food is bland and doesn't really have that authentic flavor. I wasn't a huge fan of their salsa either. The prices and service was fine. I don't think their food is horrible, I just wouldn't put it on the top of my list when picking Mexican food places to go to."}
{"text":"Food was just average tasting but I loved the options on the menu! The chips were cold though, which was a little disappointing for a Mexican spot. Service was just ok!"}
{"text":"Maybe one of best Mex restaurants we have been, though mostly typical American Mexican. I had a Mex Pizza and was amazing good, I thought. Great service and good looking food items for us all. I would sure return."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a chance. We ended up just ordering tacos and were very disgusted with what happened. We were given uncooked chicken so undone there was still blood on some of the pieces. My fiancé and I addressed this issue with the manager who told us it was because it was overlooked. Needless to say we both got very sick from eating some of it. The manager refunded us 5 dollars for the trouble. We would never eat here again. Terrible experien"}
{"text":"I have been running into this problem lately where restaurants have a choice between sauce with meat, and really spicy sauce.  This makes me sad because I am the most spice averse vegetarian you will ever meet.    Arriba has a gigantic menu with lots of pictures of the food.  I found the menu hard to navigate, especially in terms of finding something vegetarian.  I wanted the enchiladas, but the sauce options changed my mind and I got the tamale which was very sub par.  Very bland and chewy.    I suspect my experience wasn't the norm though, they seem like they would be a great place for someone who likes spicy meat.  Or cheap happy hour margaritas."}
{"text":"Been a while since we have eaten here. Steak Fajitas not worth $15.49...served luke warm, over cooked  charged for extra tortillas and a few slices of jalapenos...sever Joaquin, ignored us for 15 mins when we arrived and was less than friendly or attentive...won't be back... too bad Arribas use to be much much better..."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Arriba Mexican Grill at Chandler & 48th in Ahwatukee. This is the place with the cheesy commercials about \"hatch chili's makin' it hot!\" that remind me of old Chi-Chi's commercials. Huge disappointment.  The salsa was decent but the tortilla chips greasy and bland; the spinach enchiladas were okay but small; the black beans, rice, and salad boring. Plus they had the nerve to charge $1.99 for sour cream and $2.49 for guacamole.   Finally, Robert Irvine would have flipped over the fact that the appetizer/desert menu on the table was filthy!  You know, I've lived in the Great American Southwest for 5-1/2 years and I'm only 162 miles from the Mexican border... I have never had a truly awesome Mexican meal here. Decent but never awesome. Weird. How I miss Mad Mex back in the Burgh..."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Arriba Mexican Grill! If you like spicy this is the place for you! When your seated they give you some of the best made fresh daily chips with 3 different types of dip (a spicy bean, a mild and a hot salsa). They have a great margarita selection ( the prickly pear is great as is the mango!)   Now down to the food! They have a great selection of lunch specials that are pretty cheap (from 6.99  - 10.99) and have decent sized protons. They are served Monday through Friday from 11am - 4pm!   The dinner protons are huge! And they have a huge menu! My favorite things there are the queso fundido (a great cheese dip, spicy but good!) the Poco Pollo Con Queso is to die for, as are the white sands chimichangas. I find the white sands to be a little spicy for me sometimes, so I usually switch out the spicy pork for the machaca or chicken.   It's not only a great place for a family to dine, but it's also a great place to go and hang with friends."}
{"text":"I have gone to Arriba since I was a younger and have usually been very pleased with the experiences.  The food is delicious, and not too Americanized. Their hatch chili's are *amazing* when added to dishes. The queso fundido and beef fajitas are terrific each and every time.  The last time I was there, the bathroom was absolutely disgusting, and not just in a 'the trash is overflowing' sort of way. I brought it to the hostesses attention, and did not use it again so I am unsure if it was addressed"}
{"text":"99 cent margaritas during happy hour! Fun and kid friendly!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Arriba for years and it's always been a great meal. They have a great happy hour with free chips and salsa. A lot of people can't handle the heat from the hatch so they tend to diss like the food. If you can handle the heat I highly recommend these dishes.  Carlsbad Stuffed Chicken Breast - Chicken breast stuffed with vegetables, cream cheese, and topped with queso fundido Served with rice and choice of beans. This dish is really hot at times Hatch Chicken Especial - Chicken guisado with diced green Hatch chiles, jalapeño cream cheese, and green sauce covered with shredded cheese. Served in a boat with fresh tortillas, rice, and beans. Another great pick would be the White Sands Chimichanga - A chimichanga filled with spicy pork green chile and covered with our tasty queso fundido. Served with Mexican rice and your choice of beans. If you enjoy spicy food cooked with hatch chiles you will enjoy Arrib Mexican grill."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite Mexican restaurant. Food is amazing service is even better. TJ is my favorite server EVER. 2$ margaritas for happy hour! If you're not here you're missing out!"}
{"text":"The waiter that has waited on us for years come to find out he has been doing disgusting things and was arrested for doing inappropriate acts at a child's school he has 20 counts against him he was arrested November 15, 2016 and was totally shocked just seen it on the news channel 10  fox! Worst food I've had in ages, horrible lazy service, chip seamed to be old,  I receive my food and had asked for green sauce and server said sorry, but then never came back, could hardly eat any of it the rice was dry the sauce was so hot you couldn't even eat it, told the server and she took my place with only about 5 or 6 bits from it and said could I get you anything else, I said know that's it for me and then handed me my bill for the food I hadn't eaten, didn't even think of taking my food off the bill, so if you just want to throw your money away on crappy food this is the place!"}
{"text":"My friends took me here for my birthday while I was visiting from California. As one other reviewer said, \"At least there were no annoying birthday songs every 10 minutes.\"  When informed it was my birthday, the server just looked at me and said, \"Oh, um, happy birthday?\" and walked off. She could have at least explained that they don't do anything for birthdays. I wasn't too disappointed, but my friends were expecting them to say or do something.   The food was okay, but I felt really rushed. We weren't even done eating when the bill was brought to the table. The place wasn't packed, so it wasn't like they needed the table.   I definitely won't be in a rush to go back. It just didn't feel like a particularly inviting place."}
{"text":"ok ok ok, before you lambast me because of my previous review - hear me out.  I learned that they have a hot system, and I stayed away from the atomic crap that KILLED me last time, but this time around it was good.  It was not the best Mexican I have ever had, but it really was decent.  I will go back and try more now.  Faith has been restored!"}
{"text":"Oh man that was the most Delish Mexican food I've had in a long time!! Awesome service and every recommended plate was tasty!!!  Definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here about once a month. The food is really good, the potions are large, and the margaritas always hit the spot. They have $1 margaritas after 9pm but we rarely get here early enough for that. We either sit at the bar or in the bar area and the service has always been great."}
{"text":"Their white sands is amazing...if you can deal with the worst service of your life. I've stopped eating in house and just call my order in now. However tonight not only was my order wrong (no apology when I told them it was wrong) I also got to witness the hostess complaining about who ever took her phone. He took her phone because she was texting while I was waiting to be helped."}
{"text":"We popped in for a quick 30 minute bite at the bar and had a really good experience! We had the queso fundido, a margarita, and a draught beer. The queso was okay... it was very runny which isn't very legit Mexican style but it wasn't too bad. The service was what was really great. The food came out super fast and the drinks were really good. Our bartender was really nice and personable which made the quick stop more pleasant. In general I don't like eating at chain restaurants but this place was good for a quick stop in bite."}
{"text":"Place is alright. Nothing super special about it. Just your simple, good MEXICAN food. There is nothing really NEW MEXICAN about it besides the fact that they want to call it so.   Try their own micro brew, its pretty good if u like NON-bitter beer.  Last time we had soup and some salad. Soup was OK if somewhat plain. Salad was fine without being anything special.   All in all its not bad. Probably real good for big events as there is room a plenty.  Just to compare it is WAY way better then Abuelo's Mexican Food Embassy, which easily ranks my own list of WORST Mexican Food places."}
{"text":"This place is great there bartender is on point the food is alway great need to tip your people's and next time they just may remember you and what you like that is how it work please people be nice. The food is so fresh love it"}
{"text":"I'm mildly obsessed... I love chips and salsa! The cheese crisp is yummy, and so are the mini chimis. And man oh man!- their street tacos!   My only complaint would be is that they're a bit misleading. They don't bother to tell you that the sour cream and guacamole they offer when you're ordering with your meal, doesn't center with it. We learned that the hard way when $12 of our check was just sauces! Oops! Live and learn.   Besides that, I think they're great!"}
{"text":"The restaurant seemed a little dirty to me but bathrooms were clean.  Service was ok. The food just wasn't good.  Although I do have to say my sister liked her enchiladas.  My daughter and I felt sick later in the day. Don't think we'll be back.   Especially since there's a new Mexican restaurant in Avondale I really like."}
{"text":"We used to come here regularly, but hadn't been back in over a year and decided to come back. We should have stayed away. The service was so so slow. It was a Thursday night after happy hour and there were approximately 7-9 other table occupied. No big groups, no reason it should be so slow. And it wasn't the food that took a while. It was drink refills, and chips, and the check.  The food was mediocre at best. The bean dip was served cold and was really really thick. As if it had been out for a while and reheated again and again.  We ordered a cheese crisp with Hatch chiles on it. It came with our entree and without the chiles.  Half to 3/4 of it was burnt.  We asked for chiles, she took it away and brought it back within 5 minutes with a few cold (looked like straight from the can) chiles in clumps on it. (At least it was fast!) My husband's carnitas was about 1/2 - 3/4 cup of pork spread across chopped red cabbage.  He couldn't eat the pork without the cabbage stuck to it and couldn't get all the pork out of the cabbage.  So, we won't be back. I remember why we stopped going."}
{"text":"I really love the queso fundido sauce they carry.. that being said you must try out the Rio Grande Enchiladas..... I usually get the adobada inside but you can try both, get one of each adobada and one green chili.... super super tasty!!!! The complimentary chips and dip is also bomb!! The bean dip has a tiny bit of zip to it. I have tried a few other items but I always go back to this one... really the only reason I go is because I crave this dish so much. Anything that you can get the queso fundido on will probably be awesome!"}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch a few times, but recently my wife & I went here for dinner.  Have to say the service and food were very good.  Both of us really enjoyed ourselves.  Even though we didn't step up to the #3 pepper\" meals, our food was plenty spicy.   Huge menu and great looking deserts too.  Give it try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, great lunch specials, fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Classic Sonoran cuisine, excellent margaritas and decent prices make Arriba a great stop when you crave Mexican food. The menu is a bit overwhelming but stick with it- there's something for everyone. The classics are there- combinations platters mixing tacos with enchiladas and rice/beans. You can also opt for a grilled plate (chicken, steak, pork, etc.) if you're looking for something a bit more healthy. My wife enjoys sour cream chicken enchiladas with the house made green sauce. So good.  There's a decent kids menu that includes Mexican and American food options. $5 per plate with a $0.99 drink makes it an OK deal. Our daughter likes the cheese quesadilla with french fries. :)  They have an open bar so you have many choices if you're thirsty for an adult beverage. There are many different styles (and levels) of margaritas depending on how much you're willing to spend. Make sure to check the drink specials at the front lobby to see which concoctions are on special for the evening. Expect your typical Mexican beers on draught- Dos Equis, Tacate, Modelo, etc.  Chips served when you are seated- with 3 flavors to dip. Traditional salsa, hot picante salsa and a bean dip. All are very tasty, the picante is a slow start heat so go easy on it. Great flavors on all three dips though! Don't get full on the chips though- the servings are large and you'll miss out on a great main entry plate if you're full on chips (classic mistake)."}
{"text":"Ok, so I decided to go against the general consensus of bad yelp reviews and give this place a shot. Sometimes people just have an isolated bad experience, plus I'm always on the look out for good Mexican restaurants. Long story short, I was wrong. Like in most reviews, the food is lacking authenticity and flavor. I would have given only two stars, but the great service made it three. The problem is not the waiters, I was just disappointed in the food... It was \"meh\" just ok.. I think they could do a lot better."}
{"text":"It upsets me to have to write such a negative review about a restaurant that serves very delicious food.   Went in on a nice Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately, no wait at all. We received what we thought was decent service consisting of quick food delivery, several drink refills, and all of our dietary and pricing questions answered.   We had paid with a credit card and upon receiving our credit card statement, we noticed an additional $10 added to our bill from Arriba's.  I really hope that this just happened to be an honest mistake, not a dishonest and purposely done action on our waiter's part and the manager's, as the managers should be overlooking all of the waiter's checks while conducting the waiter's checkout at the end of the night.   Due to this unfortunate experience and unacceptable action, I have to give this restaurant a 1 star review."}
{"text":"1 star for ambiance, 1 star for chips and salsa.  We were brought here by friends (against my judgement due to lack of positive reviews) and I won't be returning.  Our waitress was very short and irritated acting with us.  And the food was quite horrific....incredibly bland.  The meat had no flavor and the rice was the most boring, flavorless Mexican rice I've ever had.  There are way too many good Mexican restaurants around to waste my time and energy here again."}
{"text":"Their food was okay. The issue that I really had was that most of the chicken that's used is dark meat and makes the food taste more different than you think. There's also not very many non-spicy food items on the menu that are edible.  If you want margaritas the size of your head, and extremely greasy and spicy food, Arriba's is the place to go. If you dont drink and are a weenie like I am with spicy food, then this might not be the place for you."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks great food relaxing and a fun place to be and oh yeah did I mention a good happy hour"}
{"text":"We went due to a friends birthday celebration.   The waiter was a young man he wasn't horrible but he wasn't good either.   They fee is several bowls of chips before we got our orders. Two of the people In my group said their food was not hot it wasn't even lukewarm. I tried a piece and it seemed as the prepared the dish and let it sit there for minute until the rest of the orders were done.   Ordered tortilla soup, liked great presentation wise but once I had of realized it was 98% tortillas that we're soggy and hardly any broth or soup in there.   It wasn't my choice to go here but the least this establishment could do is put effort into their service and efficiency and kitchen staff needs to be re educated or trained."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We sat for 10 minutes and finally had to approach the hostess to get our drinks and chips and salsa. Food came out warm as if it had been sitting for some time... maybe it would have tasted better if the food had not been sitting.  Service continued to be slow throughout the course of the meal.  The only positives were that kids eat free on Sundays and their bloody Mary's are pretty good and well priced."}
{"text":"This is about a 3.5 star mexican place to me. I've always had good service but watched other folks get like 1-star service, at a level I might not come back.  I like the White Chimichanga here. The Chili Verde is decent, and the Hatch Chilis are nice too, if you haven't had those.  4 Stars - White Chimi 3 Stars - Chili Verde 3 Stars - Cheese crips with Hatch chilis  I'm sure there are better places around but I've been coming here for several years when in the area, and I definitely enjoy this place.  Sometimes they have hot chicks working up front. If you keep up this practice Arriba, I'll five-star you sometime soon!"}
{"text":"While Arriba Mexican Grill may be exclusive to Arizona, it's desire to be a major chain may be what keeps it average.  In an area that has an abundance of Mexican establishments (both on the low and high end), very little about Arriba stands out in the crowd.  The several odd things about the restaurant stick out like sore thumb.  What's with the New Mexico theme?  Having only driven through the state, I'm not sure if New Mexican has its own culinary style.  I always just assumed that like many other southwest states, New Mexico just fit into Tex-Mex.  The menu being exclusively pictures is a turn off.  Makes me feel like I'm at an Ihop or Denny's.  And having the descriptions in a small white text over a black background in a dim room made it very hard to read.  They also seated patrons near the bar, and left the main dining section fairly empty.  I don't know if they were short staffed, but I notice as I was leaving that there was a wait, even though I was able to see that the dining room had several empty tables.  The service was excellent.  The waiter was friendly and our drinks were constantly refilled.  The ambiance isn't bad.  We were seated next to an open sliding door which showed off an outdoor water fall/pond setup.  Chips and salsa were at the the table immediately.  The spicy was wonderful.  The mild was okay.  The bean dip was awful.  The food was also pretty good.  While it tries to be different, it doesn't seem to stand out."}
{"text":"service was just slower than continental drift. never got our drinks or chips refilled. the waiter whispered to us every time he spoke. if you want to eat at the Silent Hill of Mexican restaurants, you can't do better than this place.  on the plus side, the distorted, ambient mariachi music and brightly lit fans kept my daughter occupied for the whole meal. +1 star"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food restaurant in town.  My husband and I have been eating here for years.  It's clean, affordable, great service, great location. We are never disappointed! I just had the sour cream enchiladas. OMG, they are the best!"}
{"text":"Best lunch specials during the week. Great service. You will get chips and salsa before your meal and the plate is a decent portion. I highly recommend having lunch here if you have only a few dollars.  I like this place because the atmosphere takes you out of your work zone.  I did see that they have huge margaritas.  They look good.  Didnt try one because I was on my work lunch hour."}
{"text":"ok if u like green chile its its not that bad its actually good. the service is so so and omg the prices are ridiculous there is nothing under 10 dollars if u want lunch on the weekend."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*  While Arriba isn't terrible, it certainly isn't the best either.   I will say that one thing they do quite well is spice! Anything on the menu that is coded with 2-3 hatch chiles should rock your world.   I think Wednesday or Thursday is 2 for 1 fajita day. They're never stingy with the chicken, steak and vegetables. We still like to order extra hatch chile on the side.   Arriba's Fajita Quesadilla is also good, and large enough to share. A nice blend of cheeses, marinated chicken, fajitas vegetables, and a generous amount of those hatch chiles. That thing has had me close to tears a few times with a particularly strong batch o' hatch!   I mostly like coming here for DRINKS when I find myself on this side of town! Especially those ginormous margaritas. Guaranteed to be a good night!    The Blue Moon one is my favorite (nothing to do with the beer of the same name)!  You won't find it on a drink menu, but if you ask for it, your server should know what it is. Get it on the rocks.   The beers micro brewed on site are a bust. Skip them and get something bottled or their other tap options. I ordered the Amber one once; way too much artificial lime flavor. And a waste of $5.   Service is pretty spotty; however, never have experienced anything so awful that would send me running away and screaming."}
{"text":"Friend raved about the margaritas here, so we checked out Arriba's for dinner last night.  I'd called ahead to ask if Arriba's makes their sour mix from scratch- it does.  I also inquired about happy hour-- from 3p to 7p, and reverse HH from 9p to closing, 12 oz. house margaritas are $0.99 each!  There's a short list of apps at 50% off, as well.  He wanted to try the \"margarita for two\" on the rocks, as he's tried the house margarita on previous occasions.  Presentation was nice, and it tasted very good- not obnoxiously strong and not cloyingly sweet. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=ZuAE6ZAXVIeGNKKMWbJogw#ZuAE6ZAXVIeGNKKMWbJogw  $7 during happy hour, which I thought was a steal, since the last time I shared a margarita that big (with sister) was at one of the restaurants on the San Antonio's touristy River Walk-- the margarita was $14!  Our drink last night had a LOT of ice, though, so we'll have to request for less ice next time, and there will BE a next time.  :)  Our server also suggested guacamole and chips, or a queso fundido app, so I chose the latter.  We both loved the cheese dip, despite the fact that my friend hates tomatoes and there were tomatoes mixed into the fondue. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=fVPVC3W4MQx5SNDyVN1QMw#fVPVC3W4MQx5SNDyVN1QMw  The fondue/fundido also came with a dollop of chorizo.  I appreciated its spiciness, but found it too salty.  Due to my corn allergy, I requested for fried flour tortilla chips for dipping, and thankfully, the kitchen obliged!  Awesome service, so far, which reminds me kudos to our server Chance! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=F8pySbJ7wQ_z3O5Bj-u5eQ#F8pySbJ7wQ_z3O5Bj-u5eQ  Friend didn't enjoy the flour tortilla chips as much as I did, so he asked for regular corn tortilla chips, and again, Chance and kitchen gratified.  My friend was going to order the enchiladas, and I told him I was going to try Arriba's pollo con queso.  He's had it before, so he decided that we'd just share the entree.  Fine by me, since I don't ever finish an entree at the restaurant, anyway.  (I always take leftovers home.)  The entree was a deep-fried chicken burrito, split three-ways, and smothered with three different cheeses. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=hzYXTqkmjXz9IOQ-AjgVoA#hzYXTqkmjXz9IOQ-AjgVoA  I don't know what kind of cheeses, and the menu online does not state what they are, but I liked the white variety the best- it's a softer cheese, which equals meltier, creamier, more sensual cheese to me!  He liked one of the dark yellow cheeses.  Will have to get more info on our next visit.  I wonder if I may order this dish with just the one type of cheese?  Hmm... further investigation of the menu is needed!  ;)  My friend doesn't have a sweet tooth, and none of the desserts really caught my eye last night, except perhaps the ones with ice cream; However, Arriba uses Good Humor ice cream, and these contain corn syrup, so I must say no.  Only the best, for the most part, para mi, por favor!  Can't wait to take Mom here.  I've already told her about the dinner and shown her the photos, and she looks very interested.  :D"}
{"text":"Normally I like this place but I was just there a few days ago and the service was horrible. Waited a hour to get the food. I heard it's under new management. So if that's true then this is how they will run things. Not going back.."}
{"text":"Went tonight for first time.  We were visiting from out of town.  Walked out and paid for just our drinks after seeing 2 tables who arrived after get served  and finish their meal while we waited.  The HH margarita was the sweetest thing I've ever tasted and we were told they longer garnish HH margaritas with lime. Seriously?  Place is a joke"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here.  Had the \"white sands chimi\" (pork green Chile). The Queso fundido is pretty much amazing.  I'd write more but I'm steadily slipping into a food coma.. zzzzz..."}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast!  And it is not jammed packed like every other breakfast place on Sunday morning.  I ordered the green chili with eggs and it even came with pancakes, yum!  Service was great, especially because they were not busy out of their ears and the atmosphere is very casual and very clean.  I enjoyed going and will return again for sure!"}
{"text":"After years of coming here, either today was an off day or things have changed. I always order the same thing- pollo con queso.. Today was inedible, I sent it back and didn't dare try anything else ( That's just me) The chicken was heavily seasoned and I got a lot of Grissel.  Even the rice tasted blah.....Arriba's what happened??"}
{"text":"Inediable, bad service, old meat, bad margaritas. The place was empty on Valentine's...should have been our first clue."}
{"text":"We ate here last night, and wasn't really impressed. Everything is made with lard, and smothered with cheese! Since losing weight, I have tried avoiding everything unhealthy. Unfortunately, my friends  wanted to eat here.  I really wanted to like this place, but they just don't have a lot of options. I ended up ordering the Spinach Enchilada which was okay after scraping off the cheese. I also did not touch the fried beans and fried rice. The dish just didn't look edible to me, but to be fair. My friends raved about this place, and they really enjoyed their dish."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken nachos, it was a terrible choice. The chicken looked and tasted like canned shredded chicken. I was scared to eat it. I did eat the spoonful of beans that were on them,  along with the chips and guac. That was all on my plate that looked worth eating. I won't be back for at least a year or never. I hate it when my meal is tasteless:( ruined! On a positive note I only had to pay 1/2 price due to happy hour."}
{"text":"The food here was decent, the service a little on the slow side. And they forgot to bring out my girlfriends aunts beer. We were almost finished, so she just asked the waitress to cancel it. Some time later she came by and said the manager took care of that for us, really? First, the bar tender just has to pour it in a glass, then a manager needed to cancel it? OK anyway there was no beer. Nothing great to come back for, but if your plans are to meet someone here or just want to try it, then again, food wasn't too bad at least, several choices looked good."}
{"text":"Eh, 2.5 up to 3. It was certainly edible...  We got a bunch of takeout here the other nite. Everything was decent, nothing great. The burritos were OK. Nothing as hot as I thought it would be.   I probably wouldn't eat here again but that cheese crisp with the hatch chile's is pretty awesome...."}
{"text":"I swore last time I'd never be back...well I had someone from out of town that wanted good mexican food so Arribas it was... service is so bad we walked out!  This location has the worst service!!"}
{"text":"Almost three years later and I still love coming here. The food has become more expensive, but the bean dip is still a-flowing, and my out-of-towner visitors are always satisfied afterward."}
{"text":"So after a long stressful day , I came in sort of late on a Sunday ( around 8:45 pm ) I never felt rushed and appreciated that ,I knew they were going to be closing soon . I wasn't trying to anchor in , but the staff was really cool . I ordered the Rio Grande Enchiladas with carne adobada , rice and beans . And a green corn tamale , rice and beans combo to go . As always the chips and salsa are delicious and the entree was really good ( I find myself craving that dish with the queso sauce they put on top ) my server Mike brought out two of the house Amber beers and they were really good , Mike was on top of his game and shared some suggestions to try out next visit and was cool enough to bag up the chips and salsa to go . I look forward to going back"}
{"text":"this place used to be awesome! but now... the flavor isn't there in the food or the hatch chillies!  and need I mention that I found hair in my food TWICE!!!  The last time I went, it smelled like sewage back up for days!!"}
{"text":"Wow, things have changed and not for the good. We have been coming here for a few years now and it seems like every time we leave, we always say \"I`m good on Arribas for the next 12 months\" but we keep going back every couple months. No more. Tonite was it. Wife ordered an a la carte chicken tostada and they wanted to charge 1.99 for sour cream and 2.49 for guac. Booth was filthy. Wife had to steal a clean fork from another table as some ones enchilada was still on hers. Halfway through the meal I noticed mouse crap on the wood ledge along our table so that ended my meal which wasn`t good anyway. I always clean my plate when eating Mexican food. Called the manager over and quietly explained the issue. He apologized and told us they are very careful about these things. He did knock some off our bill but after getting home and thinking about it, I was disappointed the whole meal wasn`t free being we couldn`t finish it. We won`t be back. I`ll take my chances at Filibertos. On a good note our server, Ryan did a good job and kept our drinks full and the stale chips coming."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here, and we really enjoyed it. We just moved to Phoenix and Arriba Grille is right down the street. The menu has many New Mexican and Mexican dishes. I have no idea if the food is authentic, but the Tacos al Carbone and Fish Taco plate were both really good. The chips they brought to the table were freshly made, and the salsa was very flavorful but not too spicy. Our server - Michael - was very nice; overall the service was a little uneven, but all in all ok. We will definitely go back - maybe Arriba Grill will become our neighborhood Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I went into the Scottsdale location yesterday.  I was going to be seated right by the kitchen by the host when the restaurant was 20% full and then asked to be seated in another area where there were more people around and better lighting.  The waiter never cleared our plates, and I had to order 3 meals before I could even eat anything.  This restaurant had dirty menus dirty plates/glasses, slow waiters, the food was unedible and the kitchen was slow...  I think this time I am calling the food inspector.  I am sure that there are many violations happening in this restaurant.  I tried to give them feedback, however, they  did not recieve it well.  Please don't waste your money.  This is such a poor example of no service and bad food.  I expected to get food poisoning after this experience."}
{"text":"Would I go again? No.  i agree with some of the other reviews. chips needed salt, food was not fresh, beans were runny...i had the cheese enchiladas, they were ok...  my husband got a booger in his sprite. and the manager kept standing in front or around our table...not very comfortable."}
{"text":"Okay, I just have two Specials that I would like to mention. Okay. Are you Ready?   TACO TUESDAY & CHIMI THURSDAY   I heard of Arribas but I've never been until I started working on this side of town. I'm very much loyal to Poncho's. What can I say? So Taco Tuesday is $0.99 a Taco, pretty popular. And $1.99 Chimi on Thursday, sort of popular. However, Tuesdays and Thursdays are usually packed for lunch but if you know what your ordering it's much faster. Service may not be at it's best on these days but you will get your food. (If you get the right waiter and server.)  The chips and salsa (Hot,Mild) and hot bean dip are very addicting, so watch the intake or you'll be taking a doggy bag home.  WARNING: MILD salsa may have a little heat to it. Eat with Caution."}
{"text":"Couldn't get more authentic \"New Mexican\" food anywhere else I have been in AZ. I was born and raised in NM and this place is awesome. Service was also great! Get the Chile Relleno if you want to really feel the burn!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken tacos were amazing.  Waited 15 min for a margarita .Service was ok but it was busy.  Manager stopped by and that was nice. Will return!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing...all the times I've been here they have not yet disappointed me. Customer service needs a little work but the food is very well prepared!!! I definitely recommend this place! Also I'm from New Mexico and the green chile is awesome!! Reminds me of home!"}
{"text":"Bar review only.  Stopped in for their $0.99 margaritas. The expectation wasn't high because it's $0.99, but it was still pretty bad. The husband got a beer, which for HH, came in a small glass and tasted light watered down coors light (it was supposed to be a Mexican beer). Granted, the beer was only $2, but we'd rather pay $1-$2 more for a better beer at other HH spots.  The bar itself looked a bit grimy which deterred us from ordering any food. In addition, the food that we had seen at other tables wasn't appealing.  Well, I satisfied my $0.99 margarita curiosity!"}
{"text":"Let's just say that if I'm going to be successful @ keeping my hour-glass figure, I need to stay far away from this place! But is this even possible when the food is so tempting and the chicken tastes sooooo good??!?   The Queso Fandido came with flames hovering over it and the taste matched the awesome presentation. I can't even remember which cocktail I ordered, but whatever it was, it was only one, and it had a bit of influence on the lovely tip our attentive waiter received.   I recommend and will return!"}
{"text":"I have never given this place a good review, until today. Today they deserve one. My husband has always enjoyed their food, but I'm just not an enchiladas kind of person. It's a 55° F and rainy afternoon... we are here again. Our server, the big guy with the gravely voice, was nice and prompt. My husband had his usual enchiladas something plate and was, also as usual, quite pleased with it. I chose the chicken tostada soup. Most excellent, best tostada soup I've ever had. Fantastic spices and flavor."}
{"text":"Wow, amazingly good food!  Just moved here from So. California and it's been hard to find delicious and spicy Mexican food.  Both the service and food are terrific.  I recommend this place and will definitely be back! The beans and chips are the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Went out to eat there last night and the food good but the service was straightforward. Server didn't great us. She just walked up and asked \"What do you want to drink\"? Ok that's fine. When she took our orders she had no personality or not even a smile. Ordered a cheese crisp to start. She dropped it off and said \"Here you go\" and walked off. As I was eating my meal I could hear how the table behind us had her meal wrong but she ate it and was happy with it. Our server then gave her the wrong the bill. Maybe she worked a double and was tired but it wasn't the most pleasant dining experience. Just kind of seemed like we were a bother to her and she didn't want to be there. We were planning to get dessert but we ended up just paying and getting out of there.  Is it me or should your server be pleasant?  \"Hello my name is ______, I'll be your server tonight. May I start you off with a couple of drinks or appetizers as you look over the menu?\" Not just \"What do you want to drink?\""}
{"text":"We had visited a few times before my last review and 2 times since that review and it has only become worse.  Drinks, food, service all terrible.  The worst thing for me is when you bring up an issue they seem offended that you dare suggest it's not perfect.  For example a margarita with no tequila or a cold appetizer (We've had both happen).  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Ok first off the decor made me feel dirty. Staff was friendly and polite. I ordered a shredded beef taco and my wife got the chicken con queso. She ordered charro beans as her side along with rice. The side of charro beans was laughable.  Jar was the size a side of sour cream would come in. Rice was very bland. My taco was good. I had some of my wife's burrito and we both agreed ajo als does it better. The cream cheese sauce was kinda weak in the flavor department. Chicken inside was moist and had good flavor. Chips and salsa were ok. I ordered some of their hot sauce and it was chunky like their salsa. I like my hot sauce puréed.  Flavor was there though. They also have a bean dip for the chips that was a nice touch. Now let me tell why I felt dirty. The decor had a layer of dust all over it. Millions of knick knacks and picture frames creating a generic Mexico feel. It felt very 1991 inside. Even the staff looked like a time capsule. Then the bill came and the receipt wallet was so filthy and shiny from never being cleaned and passed around by millions of greasy taco fingers. It made me sick to have to touch it to pay. Overall decent food. Just needs a good deep scrubbing and maybe an update."}
{"text":"come here every few thursdays a month for the chimichanga. its awesome. dont understand what the complaints are. good prices . good service. never had a problem and have been here about 20 times!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a beautiful water feature right in front.  Even the bathrooms were nice!  The food is about what to expect for a Mexican restaurant.  Price was average but the service was a little less than good. We went as a big group for a birthday and we only had one server... they weren't even that busy that they were short handed.  It was fun though!"}
{"text":"I've been to Arriba on and off for a few years. Tonight I needed some place to eat that was open late and would be decent Mexican food. The food has a wide variety of selections. My son had the green chili which came with tortillas . I had Pollo Con Queso . Both were fine. Nothing amazing, but definitely tasty and filling.   What was excellent was the service. Most places open late have lackluster service and a staff that always seems to be pushing you out so they can close. Our visit was the opposite of that. Our server (Ryan) was attentive, efficient and accurate. He constantly refilled the drinks and got the order in and out fast. So refreshing to have great service even on a late dining situation."}
{"text":"Decent for a strip-mall type of restaurant I suppose.  Nothing amazing.  Our waitress seemed annoyed at my grandmas questions about the menu.  She's old, give her a break!"}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant for the proximity to my hotel.  It seemed true to the real Mexican fare, in food and quality.  I'm really tired of the Tex-Mex, politically correct food that most so-called Mexican places claim to be.  The atmosphere is fun as is the decor.  Servers were very polite and they serve a kick-ass  flaming queso!  It reminded me of the flaming saganaki served at Greek restaurants.  They also serve margaritas as big as your head!  I would go back again."}
{"text":"Lets begin with cleanliness, the restaurant floors and bathrooms were immaculate. Upon arriving for a late dinner on Saturday night, the place appeared empty.  We had a large party and were seated promptly with a minimum wait. The regular salsa is delicious but the spicy salsa is best. However, todays spicy salsa was a bit heavy on the garlic.  After mixing the regular salsa and the chunky salsa in a bowl I was able to get the perfect salsa .  This restaurant is New Mexico flavor style place with plenty of dishes to satisfy your pallet.  I chose the Rio Grande Enchilada plate with adobada meat which is essentially seasoned spicy shredded pork.  They come with refried beans and rice. The enchiladas are topped with a cheese sauce that is to die for... 5 stars. The dos x amber beer was spectacular and taste better in the company of good friends and family.    The only negative in the evening, was that the restaurant was under staffed and since it was late, we shared the only waitress working with the entire restaurant. This appeared to upset our waitress because they got a late rush of people and she was having a difficult time managing all the tables. But we still had an awesome family dinner experience and everyones food was great. This Arribas restaurant is probably the best of the Arribas restaurant chain. It is good for large or small groups.  I would highly recommend this place and give it 5 stars. For a family of four with a couple of beers , $63 bucks not including the gratuity. Good value and an awesome meal."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week and love it. The lunch specials and daily specials are amazing. Fast service great food and we are treated like family here."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Salsa tasted like it was made with canned tomatoes. Food was lackluster. Got charged for food we didn't get. Big disappointment :("}
{"text":"HOLA AMIGOS! Tried this Restaurant for the first time this afternoon for Lunch. They offer $5.99 lunch specials Mon - Fri, something different each day.   New Mexican style food, which has a slight kick to it, but not too much. My Wife enjoyed it and said it was 10 out of 10. She's a tough critic. The food was pretty good and fairly priced. I ordered the Chimichanga, which came with rice & beans, sour cream. I devoured it while throwing back a Prickly Pear Margarita on the rocks with a salted rim..delightful & refreshing.   My Wife ordered the Carne Adobada and a Strawberry Daquiri. I tell you what, our drinks were impressive and I was unsure either of us would finish them. We did however. She was unable to finish her food, but that was due to the portion size. They do not cheat you when it comes to that.   I also noticed the decor and ambiance of the Restaurant. It all meshed well together, something different to observe on every wall. The music playing was Mariachi music, fitting and not too loud. It was not too bright nor too dark.   Our waitress was calm, patient and helpful. She knew the Menu items..what came with what, etc. Kind Woman. It was not busy, but not too crowded.   Take a look at the photos of our drinks to see what you can expect. They feature a wide variety of Drinks, such as their own Micro Brews, and selection of Margaritas. I wish I came here sooner, but now we found another fine Restaurant for Mexican food. Gracias'!   [Reader: Please add me as a friend!]"}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place or the best service. Amazing happy hour food and margaritas.. thats why the restaurant was slow but the bar was packed...  And the regular menu is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Yaay! We love Arriba! Huge cheap margs, killer chips, salsas and the bean dip...oh the bean dip, love it. Our food was excellent. Got tacos carbon pollo, they had really good chicken in them and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Our bartender was super sweet and my boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well, two ground beef tacos with rice and charro beans (which I stole and enjoyed very much) on the side...the atmosphere here is very busy and loud, by loud I mean colorful and I love it, the place just needs to bring back the dang salsa tower holder thing they brought to used to bring your table. Muchas Gracias....Arriba (above)!!! :D"}
{"text":"Very sad lunch.  What the heck happened?  Service was good but the cooks need to find a new profession.  They must have been out of cheese.  Every other enchilada I've ever had had cheese on it.  Taco Bell would kick the crap out of this place for flavor.  Margaritas need to get more exposed to tequila and the margarita mix instead of a bunch of ice and water.  Once again what the heck is going on?  Maybe it's the summer heat?"}
{"text":"Anywhere in the southwest that has service and Mexican food this poor should be an embarrassment. Oh and make sure there are no vegetarians in your group they will be sorely disappointed even more than you"}
{"text":"I went here once with a group from the office for lunch, and I liked the food, but the server was arrogant and annoying.  I went here again with my wife for dinner, and everything was awful, and we had the same arrogant server. He belittled us for not ordering alcohol and he was in such a hurry that he asked bad questions that caused us to get one of our orders wrong.  The fajitas were overcooked and under-seasoned and my wife's food tasted really bad. It just seemed like the quality of the ingredients used in the food was poor.  If you really want good Mexican food that is the polar opposite of Arriba, then go down the street and visit Abuelo's."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" Mexico food place.  The Spicy carne adobada enchiladas covered in queso fundido sauce is sooo good. We love the chips, salsa, and bean dip too. The atmosphere is relaxing and we have always had good service."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere & great prices! Yummy Margaritas! Good times!"}
{"text":"Food here is great. One of my favorite Mexican restaurants, and they use Hatch chilies. Depending on the day/ waiter  yes, I may have to wait for a refill, but that's happened at one time or another everywhere I go regularly.   Waiting for a meal is a treat, though often I fill up on the chips and salsa they bring out. Not only that but they bring out mild and spicy salsas as well as bean dip. Which is great since I then take most my food home, and it becomes lunch for the next day.  Food is plentiful as well as their size of their margaritas. Price is moderate, comparable to most other sit down Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but good things about this place but I didn't think it was great. The food was delicious, I ordered New Mexico enchiladas with an egg. However, the service was horrible. We waited a good 10 minutes before someone came to get our DRINK order.  And I had to wait a few more minutes for them to refill my drink."}
{"text":"I was recently staying at the Biltmore for a conference and was looking for some good Mexican food.  Arriba Grill was highly recommended by a friend that went to grad school in the area. Well, he was 100% on target with his recommendation.  The Hatchet chilies made the Salsa Verde sour cream enchiladas just about perfect.   The service was pleasant and unobtrusive , the food was great, the décor is \"original\".  What more could I want?  This is NOT you production food Mexican chain restaurant.  Thank you.  I'll see you next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Came here by accident with the wife after a workout (ironic). The food very good. Large portions cheap drinks (we didn't have any drinks that night) and overall a nice place. I give 4 stars because I plan to go back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I arrived at 430pm and asked to be seated at the bar. The hostess promptly seated me at a table in the bar. Good so far. She provided a menu and left. A couple minutes later the chip's and salsa. I asked if I could see a drink menu. She asked if i wanted water. I said yes.   Ten minutes go by. Multiple tables are seated. They proceed to place orders and a few were served drinks. Finally the waitress arrived, water and drink menu in hand. She asked if I was ready to order. I asked her what drink was advertised at the entrance. She said she didn't know. I asked if she could find out.   Another 5 minutes go by. The hostess is seating other tables so I asked her if she could get my waitress. She said she didn't know who my waitress was and wanted to know if I knew what she looked like. I had no idea. She indicated that she would find out, before she left I asked what drinks were advertised. She didn't know.   I noticed a waitress attending a table that came in at least 15 minutes after i arrived.   Another 10 minutes go by. More tables are seated. Finally the waitress arrives and tells me it is the house margarita.  Its the same waitress that was attending other tables.   Scratch Aribas. I will not return.   They are either incompetent, clueless or really don't care about customer service. It doesn't matter. I will never return."}
{"text":"I was a little wary about meeting a friend here after work because of the reviews, but I guess they are true to their word, Arriba's was A-OK.   We were seated at around 4:45pm (on a Tues.) and there wasn't too many people in the restaurant. We were seated near the bar in a booth, and our server quickly brought us out some water and chips with salsa/bean dip. The chips and fixins were good. The menu is expansive and between that and chatting with my friend, I didn't really have time to look at it. But I went with my friends recommendation and had the white sands enchilada with chicken and a 99cent margarita. The food came out quickly and hot, and it was really good.   I'll most likely be back....sometime"}
{"text":"Not the best mexican food but also not the worst. I like how they give you bean dip with the chips but the salsa is just ok and food aswell. Wait staff is nice but can be slow at some times when waiting for them to pick up the check"}
{"text":"I ordered a bunch of platters from Arriba's for a big party we were having. They did a phenomenal job and all our guests raved about the food. We had mini-chimis, mini-flautas, mini-quesadillas, chips, salsa, guacamole, and Arriba's Jalapeno Cream Cheese. It was a huge hit and everyone we worked with at Arriba's from the manager to the people who helped load the car were genuinely friendly and helpful. Excellent experience. We'll definitely use them again for  our events."}
{"text":"Went to Arriba Mexican Grill the other day for lunch w/ my wife and son.  We went late (about 3 pm), and the place was nearly empty.    Let me start this review by saying that I read many of the reviews posted by other Yelpers, and we have had many of the same experiences w/ this place.  All of our bad experiences in the past were do to very poor customer service.  When I read about the grouchy greeters and the surly servers, it was like a trip back in time.    At one point, back around 2000-03; we were going to Aribba 2, sometimes 3 times per week.  We were regulars, but never treated as such.  Same snotty greeters and servers who wanted to be somewhere else.  We liked the food, and there were a couple of servers that were very good at their jobs.  This is why we kept going back.  Unfortunately, it just got to the point that the good servers were replaced by poor ones.  We stopped going, and went to Ajo Al's instead.  On to the present.  We decided to give Arriba a try after a self imposed exile of about 6 years.   New greeters, however same old problem...not welcomed, greeter and server at hostess station talking about who knows what.  We were seated, and chips, salsas, and bean dip were brought out quickly.  Fortunately, the chips were hot and fresh.  The bean dip was good, w/ a little spice in it.  The mild salsa didn't do much for me, but the hot salsa was favorable, and was good when mixed w/ the bean dip.  Our server was quick and efficient, and brought our drinks out quickly.  I ordered the lunch chimi, my wife ordered the lunch poco pollo con queso, and Jr. had his usual bean and cheese burrito.    The food did come hot and fast.  I ordered the red chile chimi w/ red enchilada sauce, and substituted the black beans for refried.  The red chile was good; rich w/ good flavor.  The rice was the standard affair, nothing to write home about.  The black beans were good, but just a tad bit watery.    The only complaint I had was the size of the chimi.  It looked like it was a deep fried enchilada, not a burrito.  I understand that I ordered off the lunch menu, but this thing was tiny!  For almost $10.00, I expected a little more (like Ajo Al's, or Valle Luna).  My wife liked her dish, but it was also on the small side.  Jr. loved the bean and cheese burrito (for the most part, he's pretty easy).  With many other options for Mexican food in the north Glendale area, I'm not sure if/when we'll be back.  The service was good, the chips and salsa were good, even the main part of the meals were good; but the very small entree size won't bring me back anytime soon.  Arriba likes to make the claim of using Hatch chiles, and having New Mexico style food.  If you really want to try some New Mexico style food, I suggest Si Señor in Chandler, or Los Dos Molinos in Phoenix. In my opinion, both of these restaurants out do Arriba Mexican Grill by a long shot.  2.5 stars, there are other restaurants where they at least act happy to see you!"}
{"text":"Honestly, my first time eating at an Arriba's and I've lived in the Valley quite some time. I sat in the bar area for lunch to pass time while my car was getting worked on next door. Free chips & salsa & bean dip...that bean dip...delicious! It doesnt take much to make me happy! My food was good. Prices good."}
{"text":"good happy hour Friday on a holiday weekend...yummy pitcher of mango margaritas for $7.99!  kinda sweet so get a shot of tequila $2.50 - shoot half other half to spike the drink haha it's tgif.  plenty of good free chips and bean dip and salsa - good service on refills.  also enjoyed mini chimis, cheese crisp with hot hatch chiles and good guacamole...3 half price appies plenty for our party of 4 adults.  always a good time here!"}
{"text":"hubby likes Arriba so our party of 4 adults went Sat just after 8pm - waited a bit for a table but got a nice booth.  ordered a pitcher of good mango margaritas and a cheese crisp with green chiles from a gal then ordered dinner from a guy.  never got the cheese crisp (nor got charged for it) but that's ok we had plenty to eat with the complimentary yummy chips, good bean dip, salsas and we also ordered guacamole. I had the carnitas street tacos (3 biggees) only $6.99 and, dh had the White Sands chimi which he liked.  Overall we had a fun time!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. My favorite Mexican restaurant in Ahwatukee. Don't really get all the negative reviews. Food has always been great and service good. It's a little on the spicy side but that's how I like it. When the weather is good they have a nice outdoor patio. Tip: if you like your salsa with your chips spicy let your server know. They only bring out the mild along with bean dip because it's too hot for most. Ask for the hot!"}
{"text":"This place was gross. I was really excited to try it with my family as I had heard good things. The table and menus were sticky and the bathrooms were dirty. When we had the bean dip brought out to us for our chips it was old and already congealed... Seriously? Do you know what old, cold bean dip looks like?! I ordered the nachos and the cheese was dried out like it had been sitting for a long time. I didn't eat them and didn't send them back as I was fearful what would be returned. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would. So let's begin. It took over 20 minutes just to get our Drink order correctly. The waitress was writing everything down but when the drinks came the were  wrong. It took another 10 minutes for her to fix that. Ok move on to take our orders. She again wrote everything down and it took over an hour for our food to come out. People came in after us at 2 different tables and received their food before us. I spoke with management after an hour and ten minutes and magically our food came out but it was all wrong. We got chicken burrito when we ordered beef, we got trio enchiladas when we ordered combination with chicken, we got  cheese enchiladas when we ordered chicken. There was no side of sour cream. It wasn't hot at all like it supposed to be. They put tacos on the plate with enchiladas so they were all soft and soaked with the enchiladas sauce. This is the absolute worst service ever. The manger didn't seem to concerned about our wrong food orders or how long it took to get the orders out. I was a regular here and I brought my family from out of town and we received horrible service. I will never come back and I do mean never. The waitress was horrible and so was the manager and the food!!! We sent one order back to the kitchen. We still waited over a half hour for a bill for the horrible service. This place is going to the toilet!!."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of the Arribas off Bell Rd,so I was looking forward to a margarita and appetizers at this location.   We chose to sit at the bar, because there was a 20 minute wait for a table. We sat at the far end of the bar in order to avoid the huge posts that interrupt seating, so that might be part of the problem, as there was only one bartender working on a Saturday night.   It took some time to be acknowledged, but when we got our margarita it was terrific. In order to actually order some tasty snacks, however, we had to flag down a random hostess and request menus. For the standard chips and salsa that typically appear like magic, we had to ask another random employee who was walking past. The food, when it came out, was good. The guacamole was chunky and very fresh, and our queso dip was very good.   We were quite surprised by the reaction from the bartender when my husband said he didn't want 's second margarita, as she told us no was unacceptable. Again, we had to ask for plates, napkins, and silverware.   Overall... Food a 4, service a 2."}
{"text":"My favorite go-to Mexican restaurant. Love their chips and salsa, and get the White Sands Chimichanga every visit without fail."}
{"text":"So disappointing, I received what I thought was an original house dressing for my Arriba trio especial, but it was u fortunately hidden valley ranch with canned jalepeño. Bacon was burnt to a crisp, and other than that my chicken was ok. Smh no wonder my wife only orders the same thing off the menu which is the pollo con queso every time. Prices are alright but unfortunately they try to be original with bs hidden with a name."}
{"text":"Hatch Chilies... just the thought of them, make my mouth water. No one, and I mean no one does hatch chilies like Arriba Mexican Grill. Every Sunday the haul out the fire roaster and roast chilies all day long. You can buy them $5 a pound. Now, on to the dishes... there are so many, I wont list them. My favorite is the Hatch Chicken Especial. It is just the right mixture of cheese, beef and hatch, served in a mini pyrex with rolled flour tortillas and your choice of rice and beans. Unlike Renee A., I like to go on Sundays because I bypass the seating line, and go straight to the bar. No kids, and a great brunch menu."}
{"text":"Really decent Mexican food for the neighborhood! Highly recommend trying it out! Prices are AMAZING for how much food you get! I normally do to go and with an entree, side rice it cost me $7.50 but I'm top of that you get a big bag of chips and salsa for free! However, I notice with the chips that they may be reused as some are salted and others aren't and they can be stale (minus 1 star). Very tasty I would give it a try!  And with parking I couldn't find a spot at all. They should have to go parking I had to park at a run down apt behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay place.  Like the chips, salsa, and warm bean dip.  Food is mediocre.  Service okay to good.  I've been here a half a dozen times and think it's consistently okay.  I'm yet to find a mexican food restaurant I really like (for dinner, not a dive)."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish taco.  It was very good.  I finished it within minutes, though.  The prices here are generally cheap on the lunch menu, but not on the regular one.  Service was good and the atmosphere was definitely Mexican.  Good restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh boy. I am embarrassed that I even attempted to bring my family to this place. I am a mother of 3 with picky eaters. I have allergies. My parents came in for a visit and my father has some dietary restrictions also. We happily agreed upon Mexican and this place was fairly close. Service...she did what she could. It was blatantly obvious they were understaffed OR a bunch of lazy bones.  SLOW to get our food.  My father ordered the fajita. It wasn't smoking, steaming, blazing. Nothing. It was not hot. there were no tortillas to eat the fajitas like a fajita.  My sons taco was mushed into the beans and he couldn't even pick it up to eat like a taco.  My fish tacos were room temperature and I spat the fishy out. Seriously gross. Not eating that. No way. Let's get the server.... where is she???? taking care of way too many tables. I will be patient and wait. Apparently forever.  My father went and got the manager. Where was he? At the hostess stand talking to other workers. Not helping. Not concerned. Not getting a good review.  So the recap is like this: 3 sets of utensils for 6 people. Super slow service. Cold food. Management in la-la land.  I shall not return. Ever."}
{"text":"99 cent margaritas during happy hour? Sign me up! Sit in the bar whenever you can, service is much better. Hit and miss in the dining area, I've had a few awful servers here, but the food and drinks are so good I can't stay away! Try the machaca and eggs!"}
{"text":"I ended up leaving and not bothering to eat here.  I walsed in at 3:30 starving to death.  I just wanted to have a glass of wine and grab some take out to take back to work.  Well I sat there for 10 minutes at the bar with employees passing by every few seconds and no one offered to help me. A gal asked me if she could get me something, I ordered wine and she disappeared for another few minutes.  I finally just left."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years with my family.    The bean dip they serve with the chips and salsa is awesome!  So yummy!  I usually get a bean tostada or a bean burrito with queso fundido sauce.    I recommend giving this place a try.  Definitely try the bean dip and queso fundido sauce.  So worth it!"}
{"text":"Calling this \"Mexican\" food anything above \"average\" would be generosity. I doubt there is anyone of even a small percentage of Latino/Hispanic descent back in the kitchen- you could get more authenticity at a Taco Bell. I got the white sands chimichanga.... Tastes like canned enchilada sauce on a soggy factory made tortilla with some mediocre meat in there somewhere, heated in a microwave.   They boast \"Hatch green chile\" all over the menus, and claim to be the best New Mexican restaurant in Phoenix... Well my last name is literally Hatch, and I was born and raised in Las Cruces, New Mexico... And this place would not last a month anywhere in the state.   Service was rough, I had to ask three times for an extra plate and some more napkins (waitress spilled salsa all over my lap), and my drink cup didn't get refilled once. Save yourself some time, money, and disappointment and go to the Costco food court down the street instead."}
{"text":"Great Food!!!  The food is quite spicy. So be careful of what you order. I have been there twice now and was very satisfied both times.  They make a great Mango Margarita."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but this place is horrible! My parents hated it when I was a kid and I foolishly thought perhaps I'd like it as an adult. WRONG! The server had a thick accent (which don't get me wrong, I'm willing to make an effort) but he had the nerve to get rude and impatient with me when I asked him to repeat himself! He also cut me off mid sentence several times or would simply walk away while I was talking to him. It was ridiculous to the point of being comical! I felt like Larry David on an episode of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm!\" And to make matters worse the food is disgusting! Picture soggy deep-fried nastiness with dollar store canned ingredients. Gross. I hardly touched my meal and the clueless (or careless more likely) waiter didn't even bother to inquire. My friend and I were laughing and saying \"so basically we could have gone to Taco Bell and it would have been cheaper, tastier and friendlier.\" But seriously, Los Olivos, in the same area, is much better or literally anywhere else in that shopping center!"}
{"text":"The food is horrible and the staff does not care. I would never go here, even if it's just for a drink."}
{"text":"Margaritas the size of your face, food is great for the price, service is mediocre. Give it a shot, but sit at the bar."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for Mexican food.  But if you do it right - Tuesday at 3PM you can get $1.00 tacos and $0.99 margaritas.   Atmosphere is good.  Friendly service.  Queso dip is great.  Chile rellenos are HOT, beware.  New Mexican enchiladas are good with the red or green chile.  I recommend a fried egg on top."}
{"text":"I'll err on the liberal side and give three stars, although 2 1/2 would be more appropriate.  We came with friends and really liked what we saw in terms of decor and ambience when we walked in.  We were greeted promptly and seated right away.  Our friends preferred a booth (I prefer a table).  The booths have relatively narrow tables, so the seating surfaces are not very far apart - my friend and I kept stepping on each others' feet the whole evening.  That, and the table was barely large enough for four meals - even to the point where we had to send some dishes back to make room.  Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their meals - except me.  Not that it tasted bad, though.  I had the special Hatch chili burrito, expecting that it would come with a choice of red or green chile sauce as is customary in restaurants serving New Mexican cuisine.  Nope.  Just a burrito on a plate - no sauce.  It did have a grilled Hatch chile on top.  The burrito itself was pretty dry inside due to lack of sauce, though the flavor was pretty good.  I asked the waitress for some green chile sauce and was told they don't have that.  What I settled for was a Hatch chile version of pico de gallo.  It was nicely spicy, but didn't provide the necessary moisture to the burrito.  The complimentary chips and salsa (including a bean dip) were excellent.  All in all, I wouldn't choose to go back.  On the other hand, I wouldn't put up too much of a fuss if the others wanted to."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times now for taco Tuesday's with coworkers during lunch, and I figured it was time to write a review already.  I'm not the hugest fan of Arriba's, but I do dine here from time to time.  The place is usually pretty busy since its in a busy strip of town, and the service is pretty good.    I usually get two taco's and a drink of some kind while I'm there.  I guess the shredded beef taco's are not part of the \"taco Tuesday\" promotion, so their a whopping $4.99 each, which kind of chaps my a$$, if you know what I mean. I could go with the ground beef, but sometimes I want what I want.  They also have chips and dip, that come along with whenever you sit down in the restaurant.  The one thing is, depending on how busy they are, there have been a few times where I have been out of my drink completely, and been parched for a beverage, especially in the summer time.  I know their busy, but hot is hot, and dry is dry ,and I like to stay hydrated during the summer, and I'm a big beverage drinker anyways.  I'm not a Mexican food connoisseur by any means, but it seems to be average food at best.  I leave full, but not craving to come back for more.  If I wasn't going here with co-workers, I don't know that I would be dining here at all.  It's not that their bad, cause their not, but I think its more of an average/blah kind of feeling when I leave.  To my knowledge, theirs no outdoor dining here, and getting in and out can kind of be brutal with the traffic on Camelback. Overall, not a bad experience here to speak of, and I would return in the future, but nothing that strikes me as \"amazing\" or \"to die for.\""}
{"text":"Went to the Arriba in Arrowhead. A lot bigger than the one at Camelback. ( also they have their own brewed beer) Wanted Happy Hour. Was told Happy Hour is throughout the whole restaurant. Decided to sit in the bar area in a booth   We were recognized for quite sometime. Noticed the bartender was on the outside of the bar chatting up a female patron.  Finally get chips delivered  and our lovely server Juana. Asked for a Happy Hour menu. They don't have one. I do find that odd. Not even a drink menu? Weird.  We ordered a pitcher of margaritas. ( saw on yelp) $9. Ordered the nachos supreme. Half off all appetizers. ( found that out on yelp)  Nachos excellent. Took forever for our pitcher of water downed margaritas.  Decided on the 2 dinner specials. Carnitas tacos for $6.99!! Amazing! 3 loaded tacos /rice/beans.  Husband ordered the grilled chicken breast with jalapeño cream cheese and fajita vegetables for $9.99. Also very good.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the young man that delivered our meals. His name was Tony and he was so nice and funny.  When our dinner arrived we asked  Juana for the Margarita for two. ( giant) We were done with our meal before it arrived as our liver boy bartender was busy with this same patron at the bar. So annoying.  She apologized.... but too late.  Food was wonderful.... drinks slow to arrive and weak."}
{"text":"I've lived in AZ 14years and have never been. Took my car in for tires next door. Decided... yep... today's the day!!  Greeted by friendly server and very bright colorful plaster/ plastic hanging birds!  Actually a lot of Mexican pottery and items.  I do like that it is mostly booths. No middle of the room tables.  Bring on the chips and Margaritas. Day drinking...here we go.  Server was delightful.  With the chips she brought warm bean dip. Yummy. I can not confirm or deny we had another!  I ordered shredded beef tacos with green sauce.  Hubby ordered seafood enchiladas! Loaded with shrimp and scallops. Topping all in individual shells.  Delicious. Temperature was nice and hot.  Oh and I don't like real spicy... I think this is what has kept be from going there. As their ad states....\" Arriba makes it hot.....Arriba \".  Well yes.... they gave things on the menu with 2 and 3 peppers ( for spicy).  But most of the menu doesn't .  It was very good. I'll be back!!  I"}
{"text":"Service 4 Food 4 Cleanliness 4 Atmosphere 4 Value 3  Pros: When they say something is spicy they mean it. Dependable quality. Great Starters  Cons: A little pricey Way overdone on the Mexican theme.. Very tourist trap'esk.  My first experience here was probably 7 years ago. Went out to dinner with some friends. This was recommended by a buddy who had bused here back in high school. Suffering from testosterone poisoning all chow'ed into the hatch chili cheese crisp and pretended it wasn't as hot as it was. Later this turned into a weekend ritual for my Dad and I to catch up, have a cheese crisp, and some delicious pork chile verde. Ahh the old fat and happy days.  Onto the food:  Chips: Thinking back on all my Mexican food experiences I've had a bad chip experience once or twice at every place excluding this one. The chips have always been fresh, evenly salted, never burnt, and have never suffered from an oil slick.  Salsa/Dips: Mild: Tasty standard senoran style salsa. Stewed tomatoes, green onion, green chili, cilantro, onion, garlic. Nice bright clean flavor. Hot: I really love this stuff and I wish they gave you larger sides by default. This is a super garlicky \"taco\" style sauce but with more texture then the pureed cousin. Very heavy on the garlic and red pepper flakes. Crave this stuff. Bean Dip: Delicious fatty creamy refried bean dip.   Queso Fundido: A spicy, cheesy, melty happy place. Its brought to the table with some type of alcohol burning off. The chorizo, jalapeno, onion, tomato, and jack cheese are a perfectly melted and ready to burn through some baskets of chips. This will do wonders for your girlish figure.  Hatch Chile Cheese Crisp: Often a little overly done for my liking. It will snap into a million pieces on  your if you aren't careful. The cheese blend is tasty. These Chile's are HOT! I'm a spicy person and they warm me up. They will burn... twice ;) What is it with 50% of all Mexican places failing miserably at fully slicing their cheese crisps? Good luck pulling off a clean slice. Cover this in the hot sauce for and extra happy mouth.  Pork Chile Verde: I don't consider Arribas to be a true chain since it is local. That being said it still pains me when my favorite variation of a dish comes from a chain-like but it's the case here. This is the best pork green chile I've sampled in the valley. The chile flavor, the tender pork chunks, the liquefied pork fat mixed with the chile juice. Making myself drool over here. Ask for sans the jalapenos or on the side, it just takes away from the flavor.  Ribs: WHAT?!?! ribs at a Mexican place? Yeah that's right and they are actually tasty. I often have to try and fit multiple food cravings into a single restaurant. I don't believe all locations offer these but camelback does. They are likely parboiled then grilled off which is a strike in my book. However, the sauce is the right combo of sweet and spicy, very tender, not insanely fatty, and I think I can safely say they are the best ribs you will have at a Mexican restaurant ;)  Guacamole: Not my favorite. This stuff is so packed full of tomatoes and onion filler that it's a terrible rip off. It is fresh and it does have a decent flavor but it leaves a lot to be desired.  Rice: Nice and fluffy here but a tad on the greasy side. It also tends to be a little al dente which isn't a bad thing.  Beans: I really love the charro beans. Ranch style whole beans but in a salsa base with a smoky meat flavor. I would go for these over the refried any day.  I've never had a bad service experience here. It can be a little slower at times but the staff is always nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Tried the sample plate, so I can taste a little bit of everything and unfortunately I was disappointed with it all. It lacked flavor and felt like I was eating air and got full off of it.  The male waiter with the bad attitude didn't make this experience any better as we were attended to about three times. Once to place the order, second to serve the order, and last to pick up the check and no water refill unless we asked. We had a party of 10 and he didn't deserve the the gratuity of 18%.  Leave this place for the gringos and go to the Rolibertos down the street. Never again."}
{"text":"I'm amazed at how bad the reviews are. The food is good and the prices aren't bad, plus, Sunday night kids eat free. The down side is how bad the service is. Every time I go in there it takes way too long for everything from getting chips all the way to getting the bill.   The food is good, way above average. They actually have some spicy food, which very few restaurants seem to do anymore. We eat here quite a bit, it would be a solid 4 star if the service wasn't so bad."}
{"text":"Came in a little late after doing some shopping at the mall often people are rushed towards the end of the evening trying to finish so they can go home. We decided to have a seat at the bar and and Logan took great care of us ,"}
{"text":"Arriba has REALLY gone downhill... We used to LOVE this place. We gave them multiple chances over the last year but we won't be going back. I'm not going to write a negative short story about the last 3 visits but I could. I'll just say on one occasion the mini chimis came out frozen in the middle and on our last visit we got some bad chicken... as in make you sick chicken. :( The management didn't even come over and comp anything. That's really bad service. I will miss their spinach enchiladas."}
{"text":"Once again not nuts about this place.  Food seems to have lost its flavor, the front counter folks could put a smile or two on their faces.  I cant stand when someone hates their job and you can tell!"}
{"text":"Went with three others. My first & last visit.  The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish, I got a pork dish. It was dreadful. The other three I went with were not very happy with their meals either.  The restaurant was extremely noisy. Not pleasant at all & terrible food. Will never go back.  A big disappointment.  They can't even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with. They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish. The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers. Are they stupid?  I should have trusted my instincts & not the commercial.  It's a third world country. They can barely afford to feed themselves. They have no history of cuisine.  I wouldn't waste my time and money on this place again."}
{"text":"This is really a 4.5 from me.   I have been to several of the Arriba's and have never had bad service or any problems with my food. (I have been to the locations on Camelback, at Arrowhead Mall and off the 101 in N. Scottsdale)  They bring out chips, salsa and bean dip and it tastes absolutely amazing. The chips are always fresh and they have great salsa. They just keep refilling and refilling them, so my only complaint is that I get too full and cannot eat all of my food!  Jamie M. mentioned having trouble finding a vegetarian option there, but I have not had a problem. I normally get the bean and cheese burro topped with queso dip. I have also had the abado pizza with beans vs. beef the taco salad sans beef and the cheese quesedilla. I would eat any one of those items again.   The red and green sauce are not veggie friendly, but you can easily top your meal with the salsa or their queso dip, just ask for no chorizo on it.  The margaritas are really amazing too, and HUGE! I think you pay $11 but they are big enough for 2-3 people to share. The cost of the food is reasonable.  The restaurant itself is pretty fun. They have a cool mexican/sonoran theme throughout and everything is bright and colorful.   It's one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"We have tried for many years, but the manager just really seems incompetent. He's very nice, but has no place in running a restaurant. He's always confused and needs to redo things many times to get them right. Catering orders messed up multiple Times and years in a row, along with giving me a .55 cent gift card instead of a $55 gift card. We finally had to just stop going. With better management, the place could have potential."}
{"text":"Absolute best Mexican food. They feature the Hatch Chili which is hot with great flavor! Try the White Sands Chimi not deep fried...amazing!"}
{"text":"When stuck at the pricey resort up the hill this place is wonderful.  When out and about with the ability to drive around...meh.  It was reasonably priced with good drinks.  Being from Texas, I found out that the California/Baja influence on the Mexican food was definitely there.  Sour cream EVERYWHERE!  Their salsa was good, queso - HORRIBLE!  It was very crowded while we were there and it was a Thursday at lunch time!  This place also had too many tables crowded in one area.  You had the option to sit outside, but it was soooo freakin' hot I was not interested.  I could see how that might be nice at night though.  Crap shoot..."}
{"text":"My husband and I hosted a family party for 30 people in Arriba\"s adorably decorated Cantina this past weekend,  It gave us all the privacy we needed.. Andy was so nice and easy to work with. Carlton and Jesse were amazing in their help and service. Everyone seem to enjoy all the food and drink that was served."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Kinda pricey. Service very slow. Saw our waitress sitting down for quite some time at another table. It was Cinco De Mayo. I wish it had been a better experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time here after driving by many times. We were in a little rush because we had a movie to get to, and let me tell you Jennifer the bar tender had our food out in not even 10 minutes. We also always order a thousand limes with our beers, and she did not hesitate to bring out whole fresh limes for us. We had an overall wonderful experience and will definitely be back again. The manager came to greet us as well and was equally polite."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in to Arribas for lunch today. We both had taco salads - one with green chile and one with red chile. Almost immediately after lunch I started feeling nauseated and my husband experienced other GI issues. When I called Shawn the manager to inform him and  to hopefully protect other patrons, his first response was that it could've been something I ate last night. I am giving Arribas one star because of how poorly and unprofessionally I was dealt with. This is a public health issue and Shawn tried to brush it off. We've been visiting Arribas for years since their first location opened on Camelback Rd in Phoenix. We will not be back because of getting sick and because of how our concerns were responded to."}
{"text":"Sat at our booth for 30 minutes before anyone even took our drink order. Then did not even ask if we would like to order any appetizers. We sat there for over an HOUR before our food arrived. Crappy service, will not be back. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre the food was absolutely horrible, I had chilli Colorado it was look warm and the meat was rubbery,was told by waiter not to get the beef fajitas because they is the left over meear from lunch so we ordered the street tacos had to send them back because the meat tasted foul. We ordered a quesadilla instead and they were gracious enough not to charge me for the street tacos.Wont be going there again"}
{"text":"This was one of my very best experiences in any big chain Mexican restaurant. Our server was fantastic to start it all off with, he was very attentive and had an amazing personality. But most importantly...the food, it was perfect! The best Chile Relleno my mom has ever had, she has had many...it's her favorite dish. I can't remember at this point what it was I ordered, I do know I loved it...but the thing that stays most clearly in my memory is that the chips and salsa were so good that I could have eaten just that..and with the salsa came some incredible hot bean dip....Mmmmmmmm. I think I need to go back for lunch right away =)"}
{"text":"Other than not being greeted for 20 minutes service was great.  The food was mediocre.  We were really looking forward to our dish only to find out they didn't make it spicy because it's \"one of three plates that they always have to take back to the kitchen for being to spicy.\" It literally had no spice at all. Kind of disappointing, especially after we assured our waitress we wanted the spice in the dish and not on the side."}
{"text":"Good food. BAD customer service. We came at 6pm didn't get seated til well after 7pm after happy hour ended. The hostess originally said they would honor the price but they ended up not. It's fine if they won't but don't tell us they will then change it after we waited for over an hour"}
{"text":"Stale chips, horrible salsa, bean dip was NOT edible. Two stars for mediocre food, and service. Plus margaritas were good, pitcher of Cuervo gold margaritas. Meals were overpriced, $10.50 for a taco salad, which wasn't very good, $11.50 for two chicken tacos, with 2 slivers of chicken in them. Save your $$ buy some pre-mixed Jose Cuervo mix, warm up some frozen burritos, add some pace and canned refried beans.... That will much taste better!"}
{"text":"Food was good as always. Service was pretty bad. Very slow and forgot to bring plates to eat our fajitas on."}
{"text":"Looking for some decent Mexican food I decided on Arriba. The chips and salsa were the only things I ate and liked. I ordered Margarita and the Chile Relleno. The rice would have been good if it was hot. The Relleno was a frozen product with no sauce at all. It was smothered in cheddar cheese. What decent Mexican restaurant uses cheddar cheese as it's main, no sauce and gummy frozen product?  Really bad. One bite and I was done.   The margarita was huge but tasted like deluded sour mix. And I was billed 14.99 for the drink. Should have been 8.99, still over priced for the drink. They adjusted the bill. The manager and server were nice people. The drink price, probably just a honest mistake. But the food was horrible. Can't fix that by being nice. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Friday night at 630pm was told wait would be 30 min. Lots of people waiting, to be expected.  Checked the bar for open seat and noticed half the tables in restaurant were empty.  Wait was as they said, service was very slow. Place is not as good as it used to be. I would go to Ajo Als on the other side of the mall for better food and service."}
{"text":"I have always loved Arriba! Their food has always been so good and the usual gentleman behind the bar is always welcoming and pleasant. Unfortunately I have to say after my recent experience I will not be back. Came in at around 8:30 on a slower night and you could tell that it upset the server, as her attitude was rude and unnecessary from the moment she came up to seat us. The rest of the dinner was just awkward and uncomfortable due to this server. They have amazing food, but have lost a long-time customer because of this."}
{"text":"This place just sucks.  We used to come here regularly, but we haven't been for a long time.   Couldn't remember why.  Now I remember.   The food is marginal AT BEST.  To make up for the poor food; they charge outrageous prices   This used to be a very good,  although never;  great place     The place on Camelback is much better.   The prices are the same,  but the food is much better.   While Taco Bell is Taco Bell,  the food is consistent and far better than Arriba.   What a shame.   Based on my experience;  however,  we strongly recommend Valle Luna.   A little less expensive,  but the food and service is leagues ahead of Arriba in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is our regular Mexican food place. I'm surprised the Yelp rating is so low--we've never had any problems here. The food is good, not gourmet by any means, but good.  We visited on a Sunday. We could have gotten a free kids meal for our son, but when we informed our waiter that our son only eats tortilla chips, he made sure our tortilla chip bowl stayed full. That was greatly appreciated!  I always get the tacos al carbon, usually with beef. The leftovers are great the next day. My husband enjoys the flaming beef fajitas with rice.  A very pleasant clown visited our table and made our son a balloon archery set. That was a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Used to love them....sooo glad I don't anymore....Don't get me wrong, I still really like Arribas but for my waistline's sake I'm happy that I can refuse a meal here every now and then. It helps not to live in the state anymore, too!  We stopped by for nostalgia's sake and the meal was just as tasty and the service just as good. I haven't had anything that I didn't like but my go to is usually the tacos or chicken enchiladas.  The service at this location is always fast, even during their busy lunch rushes."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes on a Friday night, not a big deal except the lobby was packed full and the hostess was rude and scowling acting like we were \"in her way\". I grabbed a drink from the bar while we waited, $2 margarita and it was tasty! Our server was friendly and the food was good. Once our server cashed us out, she was never seen again. It would have been nice to have my water topped off seeing as we had spicy food and lots of tequila!"}
{"text":"This place has some serious issues. More than once the oder from the floor smelled as if it was moped with a mop that was used in a bathroom. Speaking of bathrooms. I'm sure you've heard that a bathroom speaks everything about what a business is ran like. After seeing the men's room I realized OMG! this place should be shut down by the Health Dept. We asked to be moved to a different side of the restaurant.  The whole place smelled. We left. Didn't oder just left. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming here. But man, what happened? Did management change, because everything was awful. The host was rude. Our server Brian had attitude and didn't seem to care about our needs. The food was meh. My friend ordered a house margarita and it tasted like pure rubbing alcohol. So she sent it back and said she didn't want a different margarita. The manager came over and tried to get her to buy the more expensive margarita because it would taste better. I'm sorry, but shouldn't the manager just bring her a complimentary margarita because she was unhappy with her previous one? He lingered longer trying to get her to buy one. The waiter didn't notice our drinks needed to be refilled, so we had to keep reminding him. I ordered some spicy chicken tacos-- the chicken tasted like it had been marinated in Frank's Hot Sauce, yuck! I also asked the manager to put the chicken in corn tortillas instead of the flour tortillas. They charged $2 for doing that!!! What the heck! I've never experienced that. My friends enjoyed their food though. No one was friendly and the manager just seemed clueless. I won't ever be going back."}
{"text":"I LOVE Arriba's food.  It's flavorful, plentiful, affordable and varied.  There are only a couple of Mexican food restaurants that I will go to (as a native Arizonan I have high standards for good Mexican food) and I think that Arriba's is just about as good as you can possibly get for a chain Mexican restaurant.  In my humble opinion it's a tad better than Garcia's, and FAR better than Macayo's.  The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that the restaurant itself is starting to show its age around the edges and you can see the wear and tear in the decor itself.  I think it's time for the owners to shut it down for a day and do a massive floor to ceiling deep cleaning and give it some fresh paint.  Then they'll deserve 5 stars.  :)"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. Always good food and good service. We get the massive plate of Nachos and split it. We doctor it up by having red enchilada sauce added to it under the cheese and on top of the ground beef. We usually have LaRea as our server. When we lived in Central Phoenix before we bought our family home we celebrated our engagement in August of 2013 with the boys at the Camelback location. We just love Arriba's"}
{"text":"I keep coming back to Arriba. I love the colors and style of the interior decoration, the New Mexico and Mexico flavors that spill over each page, and they brew their own beer! One lucky day we wandered in as the brewer himself was wandering around and shared some of his latest brews with us. It's always fun trying their new flavors. The burritos are great, as are the quesadillas, and salsa, and spicy cheesy deep for the chips!  The margarita special is always worth the trip if we're not in a beer mood, I just secretly wished for a few more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Really wanted to try this place for the first time, called to get their specials and place a to go order for everyone at work. $4.99 chicken chimichangas, score! Only problem?!? Can't get that special \"to-go\" it's dine in only!!! To-go price is double, $9.99! Major bummer since we can't close up shop and all go out to eat, why can't they accommodate \"to-go\" orders, you know, people working for a living who could really use a special price?!? Oh well, guess it's Filiburtos again instead, kind of unfortunate!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at this restaurant all the time. The food went from decent New Mexican style cuisine to ill-cooked meals that taste like salty cheese. I stopped going months ago and won't return. Not sure what happened and it's a shame! I agree with the other posters that say the service has gone downhill too. I once asked 3 times for a drink refill and never got it till after I paid."}
{"text":"So I went here for the first time today I'm new to AZ been desperately trying to find decent Mexican food since I moved here I came to the right spot the flavor was amazing the food was to die for I'm very picky about the way Mexican food is cooked and there were no complaints I do wish the server was more helpful with the menu recommending choices since it was my first time but she got all the food out in a timely manner I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"I concur. Arriba's is good Mexican food but watch out, because it is HOT.  I'm not just talking the normal style of hot where you have a glass of water handy and take a sip here and there. This is the hot where you need a few pitchers of water sitting right next to you to quench the pain that is their hatch chiles.  If you get a cheese crisp, I dare you to order it with the chiles. Holy mackarel they about burned my mouth off.  They made my eyes water and even made my lips burn. And if you're thinking that I'm just a wimp when it comes to chiles, think again. My brother can handle pretty much any level of hotness, but even he couldn't eat these.    In fact, we had to pull the chiles off the cheese crisp to eat it, but it was too late. The hotness had already seeped in and it was just too mouth-flaming hot for either of us to eat it.   The rest of my meal was great (enchilada and rice) and I loved their jumbo margarita!"}
{"text":"I am not sure how I feel about Arribas.  They have only decent food and pictures of each food item on their menu.  For some strange reason, this bothers me.   Also, I got a margarita here once and I think I was drinking only sweet and sour mix.  What happened to the tequila?    My advice:  head elsewhere for Mexican, there are plenty of other, better spots."}
{"text":"Happy hour after 9pm with 99 cent margaritas and half off appetizers is what brought us in to this restaurant after Glendale Glitters.  Waiter was an ass but warmed up to us after a bit.   The flaming queso dip was again; not real cheese.  What is it with restaurant trying to pass off processed cheese food with spice and call it queso.  I would much rather pay more for the good stuff than order something like this crap.    The rest of the meals and dishes were great.  Pretty over priced for what we got, but it was tasty."}
{"text":"Super slow service. Server barely cracked a smile at the very end in hopes of a decent tip I'm sure. Uh riiiight. Food was edible, but not good. Would never come back. Manuel's is like heaven compared to this place. :("}
{"text":"Thieves. Stole money from us, admit to it and refuse to make it right. Beware of this location.   The GM is a DBag, the waitstaff are criminals. No wonder they are about to lose their business."}
{"text":"Very authentic, great service. Drinks were delicious!  Meals were served very quickly."}
{"text":"Ate here about a month ago.  Its just what i expected with the food, delish.  I like that it has its own personality.  Everyone was great and got us all the extra sauces, sour cream, etc we needed.  I will happily stop back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and i have NEVER had a bad tasting entree or dessert. I love the chips which are thin and warm and the regular salsa *not the hot one! as well as the bean queso dip all of which are put on the table when arriving.  I would highly recommend eating there~"}
{"text":"Mexican food , aimed at white people who aren't familiar with real Mexican cooking. And the prices have increased , or at least it feels like it's gone up."}
{"text":"5Star service. Our first time here and everything couldn't have been more perfect. From the looks of the giant video billboard outside advertising $5.99 lunch specials we expected average Mexican fare. We got much more.  Not only was the food excellent, the service was equal to the likes of The Pointe.   The Food - Brunch served from 10:30-4:00 I got the South of the Border Ranch Style Eggs with pork chile verde, eggs basted. The taste of the pork was superb. You can tell everything is made fresh. The food didn't come out in 5 minutes either so it's apparent they take their time making everything to order. She had the Breakfast Tostada substituting fajitas veggies for the meat, otherwise served with chorizo. Again, all the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  The Little Things John, our waiter is low-key, extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He knows how to adapt many dishes for the vegetarian and gluten free eaters. We never had to ask for a thing.  If we needed an extra napkin, it was on the table before we had to ask. Used creamer and sugar packets were immediately bussed. A new cup of coffee was on the table just as I was finishing my last sip. The manager, Jason, made a nice appearance and welcomed us.  After the meal, John spent a little extra time socializing but otherwise he was the invisible waiter who took care of all our needs.  We'll be back and next time we're bringing our son on Sundays for face painting and because kids eat free.  Thanks Arriba!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with the family tonight and came away very unimpressed. I wasn't expecting fine dining, but decent Mexican food. Anyways, off to the review.  Service: The hostess welcomed us with a friendly greeting and then taken to our table. The waitress came for our order and greeted us with a friendly attitude (which always helps). After the food order was placed, she was kind of slow and it wasn't that packed tonight. I made a simple request for some extra napkins and silverware (funny how I had to ask for it). It took a few requests to finely have the napkins. So, the service was okay at best.  Food: They started us off with there chips and salsa, but had a bit extra with the bean dip. The salsa could use a lot of work and add some favor to it. The bean dip was actually good and had some kick to it. Now for the chips and it's pretty hard to mess these up, but they tried. Some were spot on and some were left looking wet with grease (not very tasty at all). Onto the kids (2 kids) food, which was chicken strips with French fries . The chicken strips were good (I tried them), but they couldn't even get the fries fully cooked (some were well under cooked). Next up was my wife's food, which were the  Pecos Sour Cream Enchiladas. Now my wife loves sour cream, but these guys over loaded them to where she got overwhelmed by the sour cream and started eating my kids chicken strips. Now onto my order and that was the Arriba Taco Salad. Had them take it back cause I didn't see that it came with ranch dressing and I hate ranch dressing. Anyways, they were nice enough to fix that mistake. It was a pretty decent salad with the grilled chicken and guacamole.  Overall: I'm not impressed with this place and truly doubt coming here again. Nor will I be recommending this place to anyone else. They need a lot of work and hopefully they read this review and fix it."}
{"text":"We love this place!!    We used to like to come in, when they offered up an all-you-can-eat (early-bird) dinner, that wasn't publicized, but we knew about it, and utilized it up to the last day of the program.  :)  They have THE BEST 99 cent margaritas ever!!  Plus, if you come in at a certain time, you can get appetizers for half-price.  A couple of chicken quesadillas, an order of guacamole, and 2 margaritas each, and we are out of there for under $19 - you can't beat that!!!  Plus really delicious chips and salsa, including a bean dip, that is pretty tasty!!  Ole!!"}
{"text":"Aaron!!!  What a great waiter!!  We went in today, ordered up our appetizers (two chicken quesadillias, guacamole dip), and our free cheese crisp, that was in the Suns program.  Along with a total of four 99 cent margaritas - under $19.00  Aaron was on top of everything!  More salsa, more bean dip -- no problem!  Brought us containers, for our leftovers, down to little cups w/lids, for extra salsa.  Along with a bag, to carry it all home!  Thank you Aaron -- and to the nice young man, who greeted us at the door.  All good.  We will definitely will be back, when we are up in the area...  Plus...........Aaron came running out the door, when I had stopped to look for my sunglasses; as he had picked them up while clearing the table."}
{"text":"I feel like this is partially my fault for eating at a Mexican food place with a neon billboard in front. Someone told me it was good so I decided to go the margaritas were just right and the chips and dips were yummy. I ordered the floutas and yuck! The meat could not have been beef, I ate two bites and that was it. Our server asked if sour cream was okay said sure and then noticed a two dollar charge for a lump of sour cream on there. I really wish I would have just stuck with Ajo Als up the street."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how they got such great reviews from some of the people but let me tell you, the host that seated us burped out loud which was really awkward. I had a strange feeling after that. My daughter had a beef taco and I had a beef burrito and the meat tasted bland- no flavor at all. I did tell the waitress but she seem to not care and I probably should have said something to the manager but I didn't. The only thing that we really liked was the salsa. The margarita that I had was small, overpriced and didn't even taste like it had alcohol in it. We won't be back since there are so many better places around."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst service I've had in awhile, the place was empty and our server never came to us. I think if they changed it to a serve yourself buffet it would be a much better place to have dinner"}
{"text":"This place is quite interesting. The bartender is slammed and has to serve the bar, make drinks for the restaurant, but also has to serve a lot of tables to. The managers aren't even helping the poor guy and they are just walking around, and that's very alarming to me. I think one of the worst things was my boyfriend and I sat down and finished our chips and salsa, so about 15 mins before we even got a glass of water. Not to mention my boyfriend had to get up and go to the bar and order our food because we weren't getting any service. Then on top of that when he ordered a drink for us he had to go up to the bar and order it, and grab the drink himself. There was just no organization there and none of the servers even looked happy, which to me says a lot."}
{"text":"We went here today around 5 o'clock on a Saturday. There were six adults and three children. The chips (some soggy) were cold and uneventful. The bean dip and salsa - complementary, we just okay.  The tea was okay. The margaritas that my friend had was lacking in flavor and booze. The Shirley temples were sort of flat and just okay.  The crispy cheese crisp was alright. The cheese just sort of reminds me of melted candle wax. There's nothing special or flavorful about any of the cheese. Chicken taco was bland and boring, boiled chicken, with no flavor. The beef taco was okay. The food was not hot. It came out just warm. The refried beans were just alright. One of our friends had the fried ice cream. The picture on the menu makes it look really big. But in reality it's very small.  We liked going to the Arriba on Camelback, and we were expecting good service and pretty flavorful food like we get there. This Arriba was very bland and unsatisfying. I will avoid the place. Maybe the Camelback one is still good. But this one just tastes like boxed macaroni and cheese. Everything had pretty much no flavor."}
{"text":"I went there for happy hour.  The chips and salsa were good.  I was a little disappointed in the service.  We had to ask for everything.  I sat there with an empty glass for quite some time.  The bartender could have been having an off night so I will give them a try again."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Food is ok but the service is absolutely horrible. Roberto has no idea about customer service , can't even give you the right bill at the end. When you are hand the wrong bill to the server and he reprints it and give you the same exact wrong bill again after waiting 15 minutes somebody shoot me!!! Find better help your restaurant is empty on a Saturday night at 7pm pay attention management!!"}
{"text":"Now I remember why it's been two years since I've eaten here. Service is slow, even on a night where only a few tables are occupied. There is constantly a group of employees chatting at the host stand. The food was overpriced for the quality I received and it didn't taste fresh. The total bill came to $50 for two adults and a child with no appetizers or desserts. I don't mind spending money on dining out if the food actually tastes good. The enchilada, rice, and beans were bland and barely warm, but the taco was fried too long and all the beef inside was crispy. There are so many better options for Mexican food in Gilbert. Arriba needs to greatly improve in order to compete."}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican restaurants.  When I dine alone, I usually have the Nachos Supremos as a meal.  Other items, particularly those with chicken, are very good.  Watch out for the occasional loudmouth uncouth waitress though.  Once I went there.  She expressed absolute amazement that I planned to eat the entire plate of Nachos Supremos myself.  When I had finished them, she came to my table and exclaimed that I really had finished them all.  As I was leaving the restaurant, she was sitting at a table with someone else, and she exclaimed in a loud voice, that I had eaten all the Nachos Supremos myself.  I have decided to keep the rating at four stars, but just thought people should be careful what they order, as the waitress may judge you on how much you order and announce her opinion throughout the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"Aribbas is really a hit and miss here, staff and management was very pleasant however the tacos i ordered the roswell tacos was no better than a microwaved meal.   Management teying to better understand how they could improve questioned us with the veracity of a criminal investigator. Perhaps a written form we be more appropriate. They deducted the cost of the meal appropriate at any price point resturaunt.  Drinks are over priced and at the end of the day id rather stay home."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in about a year, but last time I was here the food was da bomb! The spicy beans are beyond delicious. I always get the cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. Queso fundido is delicious. Pretty good Mexican food to say it's not California or Mexico who has the best Mexican food around. I will give them credit, it's not TEX MEX...still confused about what that even means? LOL"}
{"text":"Went to this place for a girls night out. Made sure to get there at 5:30 so we could take advantage of their happy hour. When we ordered our drinks and food we told our waiter that we wanted The largest margarita they had that was on the happy hour. he said that was great and then asked us what type of tequila we wanted in each drink. We each told him our tequila choices. We sat there for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours eating and drinking and having a good time. Got our checks and were horrified that each of our margaritas were $15!! How did the price go from what was supposed to be $5 a drink to $15. When we confronted the waiter he said we got premium alcohol, so they weren't happy hour. We were floored. If picking out your tequila was extra, he should have never asked us!! We told him we wanted happy hour margaritas from the very beginning. We got the manager involved and he basically said that there must have been a misunderstanding but he was standing behind the pricing. Really?! Then when  questioned if premium alcohol was on happy hour he said it was $2.50 a shot. If that was the case, I could have accepted the $5 margarita charge with $2.50 for the extra shot of premium tequila. Where $15 came from is BEYOND me. Horrible customer service. We were pretty vocal about our upset (some of us got multiple drinks). He later came back to try and redeem himself and said he would take 20% off the entire bill. It was better than nothing, but we won't be going back. I still paid $5 more than I should have. Great way to ruin a wonderful night for us!"}
{"text":"I first want to start off by saying that costumer service was EXCELLENT!!! Our waitress was extremely nice, helpful, and efficient. And to top it off the food was delicious!!!!!!!!!! The bean dip is excellent and very unique can't wait to go back to Arizona to eat in this restaurant."}
{"text":"I always like coming here, you can always count on getting a good hot meal, friendly customer service and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not a big Mexican food fan, but husband decided last night in lieu of anything else to have Arribas. Also, decided to take it home. We ordered the chicken chimichanga with rice and refried beans. My husband gets white sands chicken with hatch green Chilis. Both meals were very good, I only ate half my portion as it seemed large to me. Surprisingly, we also got a bag of chips and salsa with the meals. Overall, it was good, portions were large. I'm good with not having Mexican food for another 6 months or so."}
{"text":"When my mom suggested we eat at a simple casual Mexican restaurant for her birthday/my brother's grad school graduation celebration, I was a little surprised. She herself has only been in one other Mexican restaurant years ago and loved it...no wait, I take that back. She's been in one other one but did not enjoy it as much as the first time. Eh. Anyhoo...My brother suggested Arriba because it is one of his favorite restaurants. (Note: I keep encouraging him to yelp about his favorite places in Phoenix since he lives there.)   It was not terribly crowded for a Saturday afternoon, which was nice. I was pleased to learn that they have brunch options which is served until 4 PM on the weekends, if I recall. Up until the restaurant, I had trouble deciding what I wanted to eat since I had gained some weight being around family....eh, that happens right? I opted for the make your own omelet, and it came with beans and some potatoes. The potatoes were bland and needed a little salt for flavor. My dad who has never stepped in a Mexican restaurant, only because he is not a huge fan or an expert in Mexican cuisine, enjoyed his carne asada and rice. His plate was CLEAN! He did say he would come back again, and for my dad to say that is a good thing. My mom and brother shared some a lot of food, but honestly I was not paying attention to what they ordered. Oh and for dessert? We had 3 orders of the flan. I still stand by that my mom makes the best leche flan ever, but the one at Arriba was just as tasty. I think the cinnamon sprinkles help. ;-)    Overall, I would have to say that we as a family enjoyed this place. Sadly, our trip in Phoenix was too short otherwise we would have gone back for at least a second round. We were seated right away and had great service.   PS: The little to-go menus at the front are slightly different than the big menus at the table. I only know because my dad wanted to order something else from the small menu, and apparently it is only served during the week."}
{"text":"Shout out to the best server larae! She was sweet and answered all my questions about there delicious roasted hatch chili salsa! We will back just to see her! Thanks again"}
{"text":"Arriba's was not as good as they used to be, apparently the original owner passed away and its under new ownership. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The food is always great. As mild or spicy as you want. Usually the service is great. The last time we were there it took forever to get our food. It was still good, just took a while."}
{"text":"If you like HOT, try anything they have with hatch Green Chile. Fantastic ! Happy hour prices are the best in town!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast on the weekends is the best-kept secret in the area. The menu features not only Mexican items but plain-old bacon, eggs, and pancakes. Prices are better than at most typical breakfast places.   The great thing about it (and something that this review might change somewhat) is that the Sunday morning crowd seems to not know about it, or are scared away by the fact that it's a Mexican restaurant that they think only serves huevos rancheros for breakfast.  Thus, it's always easy to get seated."}
{"text":"Ummm.  It's ok. My first issue is that the service is not always great. We consistently have to ask for plates/utensils, and the staff is not really observant when you need a drink refill. The other week my kid spilled her water and the bus boy handed us towels so we could clean the whole table ourselves. I didn't mind helping but the seriously stood there and watched us juggle plates and cups ourselves.   Our second issue is with the appetizers. We eat here weekly because my kids really like it and there are a few dishes we order every time. Lately though, our cheese crisps have been coming out burnt and partially inedible.  Last night the chicken chimis my daughter wanted came out burnt so badly that I can't believe they actually served them to us. If I had hit her on the head with one I may have caused an injury. When I pointed it out, the guy who brought them for our server actually tried to ignore me. We got a replacement set but they came after a few others in our group were already finished eating. Seriously they could have made a set on the fly. I would have liked to have told the manager but she asked how things were as she walked away and there was no sign of her when we left. I really hope they read these reviews or I'm going to find another place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the salsa is one of my favorites around the Gilbert area.  I have not had a bad service experience at this Arribas, though I typically go during busy dining times."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I experienced lack of care or knowledge. Food was OK I've had much better and much worse but the charges they don't tell you about are what kills me. They ask if you would like sour cream or guacamole but don't tell you it's an extra $3 each. That really raised the price to what a five star quality dining place and this place is no where close to that. For the birthday girl they told us they offer a  complimentary ice cream or sundae. But never completely tell you that  complimentary is actually $7.  They charged the wrong card for our order. We had a party of 16 most being kids and six are free and the book was still close to $200. I would recommend if you want good Mexican food at a good price go to ponchos on central ave in phoenix. No hidden charges there either."}
{"text":"TOTALLY AGREE WITH JULIA G. !!!! I was optimistic when  I tried them again after eating at Arrowhead once.   \"This is a poor excuse of a Mexican Restaurant.. and it's is not the location or the decor..it is their employees.... the people they have serving the food and bar tending.. Bar tending.. inattentive, no character..no charisma.. no personality, not hospitable\" IS TOTALLY ACCURATE TO DESCRIBE THE BAR WENCHES. I had to order through them for a to-go order and they ignored me completely until I practically yelled at them. TO-GO orders are an afterthough where the hostess sends you into the bar with a hap-hazard wave of the hand in the bar's general direction. When you get to the bar, if the seating is full, you have to step into the two staff station area to order, the waitstaff are annoyed you are in their way and NO ONE ACKNOWLEDGES YOU AT ALL. I was a GM at several restaurants and rule #1, you dont' avoid customers eyes, rather, you greet them, acknowledge their presence and let them know you see them and welcome them.    Besides this GLARING employee problem, I have to tell anyone buying this food who thinks they are getting New Mexico style, Hatch NM food, guess what you are being ripped off!  I grew up in Hatch New Mexico and nearby Las Cruces. We personally knew the farmers and farmhands in the fields tending to the chiles. We had amazing meals at their homes and community events and everything related to this style of food  is simple,  yet delicious. I consider myself an expert on the subject and I am telling you this food is posing as geniune.  My true test is always at restaurants claiming NM style is the Green Chile and Chili Colorado. Neither here are very good. Actually, the White Sands burrito was so poor I almost called back to get a refund. There was no meat in the burrito, literally 4 pieces of meat. The entire filling was green chile sauce without enough meat. Then, they cover this in a white fundido, which from my experience as a cook was more cornstarch/flour  in it than cheese. Bland and boring. It was $13 and  when you add sourcream and guacamole, it was $17. The heat from chiles was there, but just making something green chile-hot does not make it geniune NM food.  This is a scam-100%.Another chain trying to cash in on a hip trend and excuted poorly.   Rice is mediocre and I would swear they used a consommé (bouillon ) like Knorr, which has MSG in it. My headache afterward hints at this being a valid assumption.   Beans are 'straight out of can' in taste.  Basically, skip it, overpriced (EXPENSIVE IS MORE LIKE IT )and grossly overrated.   You will know you may have found a true NM style food stop when you see the option of getting any plates \"Christmas Style\" and Green Chile stew is on the menu along with sopapillas that only cost less than $2.50."}
{"text":"Service here last night was a little on the slow side - and the place was half empty at 7pm. However, the food is very good. I also love how their menu includes photos of every plate. They roast hatch chilies and brew their own beer here. The decor is like an over the top Mexican fiesta."}
{"text":"Ordered a chimi. The waitress brought me a burrito. I told the waitress I ordered a chimi. She said it was. I told her a chimi is deep fried. She looked like I just kicked her dog. She took it back and brought back the same thing acting like they did something different. I asked for the cook, he said it was deep fried. It wasn't, I gave up and ate it. All tortilla with a tablespoon of meat...horrible."}
{"text":"I was so excited with the thought of getting off work and having one of Arriaba's large margaritas.  It's Cinco de mayo and this is a Mexican food restaurant.  I've been here before for this particular celebration and had a really good time so this review I'm writing is was really disappointing.  My friends got there ahead of me about thirty minutes and had not been approached by any wait staff to order drinks, or offered salsa and chips.  My tip meter immediately starts the calculation down.  After having to go and ask for someone to bring us chips for a table of 5 they brought us one bowl of chips, one small container of salsa and one small container of been dip.  Ok no big deal at least we go something.  Finally the waiter comes over and says oh I'm sorry, I just got into work can I get your drink order.  Had we really been waiting an hour for a waiter to be called in to serve our table?  The restaurant at this point is packed and as I look around there is a table of about 15 ladies who look really restless.  I'll get to them in a minute.  Our waiter takes our drink orders and we wait again at least another 30 minutes for drinks.  He finally comes back and only has two of the five drinks we ordered.  He asks us what were the other drinks we ordered. Seriously, you wrote this stuff down and you don't know.  Ok, we tell him and he promises to come back.  He did come back about 20 minutes later with a small margarita which looked watered down in a plastic cup, another margarita which was supposed to be large in a small glass and he had a plastic glass in which he filled with the rest of the large margarita that my friend had ordered.  I'm thinking at this point someone is punking us because the service can't really be this bad on Cinco de Mayo.  Side note the manager came to our table and said that we wouldn't have to pay for the drinks since it had taken so long.  Ok.  I agree with that because honestly the drink was not good.  Who was tending the bar????   We finally get our food order in and actually that didn't take too much time but I'm sorry the food really wasn't that good.  To say I was disappointed in you Arriba for your service, food and drinks was an understatement.  Let me make a couple of suggestions my friends and I came up with for an occasion as big as Cinco de Mayo.  First, make sure you have adequate wait staff to wait the crowd that you know you are expecting.  Second have more than one bartender working that day. Better yet have one that can actually make a decent margaritas. make sure you have more than just one manager on duty because with the amount of people there you are going to need more presence.  I believe there was only one manager on duty.  Oh and when you bring out food, could it be hot?  Nothing worse than waiting almost two hours with extremely bad service and getting lukewarm food.  Oh let me not forget about the table of ladies that was sitting about 5 feet from our table.  After being ignored for almost as long as our table was they all, not one or two, all of them left.  All I could do was shake my head and wonder how much money you just let walk out of the door and no one tried to make it right for them.  I will never go back to this Arriba's ever.  Here it is Cinco de Mayo and all I really wanted was a margarita and I was disappointed.  Let me suggest you take a page from Maggiano's customer service book."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place.  My wife has food poisoning from their fiesta quesadilla as I am writing this review. She has in bed and the bathroom all day. And the day before mothers day."}
{"text":"For starters, I was ignored upon entering the restaurant and standing (alone) in front of the hostess stand while the 2 kids working kept talking and doing god knows what.  I finally said, \"Can I get a table?\"  They said, Oh, I thought you were waiting for someone.  I guess I'm not allowed to eat a restaurant alone?? After 14 minutes of sitting and getting more frustrated, I stopped one of the 40 employees that had walked by my table ignoring me, if I could get some chips and salsa and a waiter.  A guy came (and seemed super annoyed) and dropped off a bean dip and mild salsa with chips.  I asked for hot salsa (as they normally bring you that) and he said, \"you want hotter than this?\"  (it was mild, and I guess being a white girl they assume I want tomato sauce? wtf??)   I ignored it and ordered a sampler plate which was to have a taquito, mini chimi, mini taco, and a green tamale.  It took 35 minutes more just to get that and the place was DEAD.  I was so annoyed.  When the food arrived it was NASTY.  The tamale had been microwaved until it was hard and one of the ends was crunchy.  The taquito was covered in brown guacamole.  Yes, BROWN.  The mini taco appeared to have a bean/meat mixture.  The only thing edible was the mini chimi, and it was like the kind you get in the frozen food section at Fry's.   I was so disgusted and tried to get the attention of someone, anyone.  I finally asked the hostess to get me someone and that's when my waiter came and said, \"You wanted the check?  Here's your check.\"   I wanted to punch the dude, but I'm not a violent person.  Ok, maybe I am, but I know my bounds.   I figured it was a fruitless effort to waste time explaining how bad they suck.  Because all of them suck and they wouldn't have comprehended it.  So, I paid my $16 bill and left.  For the last time.  I will NEVER go back to that sorry excuse for a restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always our staple when we're in the area and lunching out with coworkers. It's no-frills, no-nonsense Mexican food. The lunch crowd gets busy, and the parking can be challenging at times, but once you're inside, usually there's not a long wait to get seated. Food is good, fast, and cheap (and check out their lunch menu), and the folks working there are nice. All of these are the reasons why we keep coming back. Their formula just works."}
{"text":"Well.. I order a Enchiladas with adobada meet  Was the most nasty adobada meet I eat  The waiter was nice when my husband and I arrive  But I'm still waiting still for my refill she never bring me anything I am very upset I did not enjoy my dinner was horrible  This location in Arribas  I don't have idea what they sale but I'm sure Mexican food they don't sale NASTY"}
{"text":"Although I was familiar with Arriba Mexican Grill, I recently ate there for the first time.  I prefer local eateries over chain restaurants, and with only 6 Phoenix locations I can classify them more as a local place than a chain.  We went there after attending a function at Biltmore Fashion Park and we both had a taste for Mexican food.  Since it was a little late, it was good to find a restaurant right on our way that was still serving.  The first impression upon walking in is that the place looks pretty touristy, but many sit-down Mexican restaurants do, so no negative there.  We were greeted by two friendly hostesses who seated us immediately.  A busboy immediately brought water.  Now that I've used the word \"immediately\" positively twice in the same paragraph the next use of it wasn't so positive.  Within seconds the waitress immediately came over and asked us what we wanted to drink.  Now, there's a fine line between being ignored for 5 minutes or more, but this young lady hasn't learned the fine art of counting to 20 before approaching a table.  I recognize it was probably nearing the end of a long shift for her and there weren't many other customers, but that was not the most pleasant way to start an experience at a restaurant.  She gave us a little more time to look at the menu after she brought the drinks, but not much.  There she was again!  Fortunately something caught my eye that looked really good and I was ready for her.  I ordered the Carlsbad Stuffed Chicken Breast , which was stuffed with vegetables, cream cheese, and topped with queso fundido and served with rice and choice of beans.  Arriba takes great pains to distinguish themselves as a New Mexico style of food and a large percentage of menu items were uniquely different than most Phoenix-area Mexican restaurants.  They also make a big point of using Hatch chilies and denote the hotness with images of 1, 2 or chilies.  Mine was 1 chili.  It was served in a reasonable period of time and was a surprising amount of food.  I loved it.  I also ate all of my rice and beans (I rarely do) ... the rice was light and fluffy and the beans did not taste greasy.  There was also a tiny salad of undressed lettuce and tomato, more for decoration than anything else.  As we were both slowing down the waitress made a well-timed visit to our table and we requested to-go boxes.  She returned promptly with those as well as the check, which was picked up within a minute.  While we were eating a lady who appeared to be a manager stopped by to ask if everything was okay.  Bottom line ... this is a decently good restaurant.  Service is good, décor is nice, not too noisy, lots of food for the price (not that it's cheap, but at $12 for my entrée I got a very large and tasty chicken breast.  At most Mexican places for $12 you get a couple of tacos or a burrito or a couple of enchiladas with a little shredded meat inside - my plate had much more real food than expected."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night for the first time. A little worried because of all the negative reviews. Arrived around 5:00 to a 10 min wait (no biggie). While waiting we got to hear the manager hit on the hostess, so at least we had entertainment. Seated and waited 10 min. For our server to appear. Seems like they were short handed because she said she was very busy. Order waters and queso, which takes another 10 to get. Then had to wait another 10 to order  (not even kidding). So 40 min after arriving we order, still waiting.  Had to ask a hostess for refills, which never came. Food finally arrives and is not too bad, but have definitely had better. The best part was the queso, it was delicious. Could be a good place but service sucks, which I think is due to understaffing, not waiters fault. Probably won't return as this is the main complaint you hear about."}
{"text":"I have always loved this restaurant, but have had to stop going to it because my last 3-4 experiences were not very good ones.  The last time we were there I ordered a chicken chimichanga and they brought me what was either fish or undercooked chicken. I took one bite and then looked at it and it was pink. Chicken obviously isn't supposed to be pink. I sent it back and got another one and it was ok, but still not all that tasty.  The time before that my pollo fundido had cinnamon on it as if it had been fried in old oil that had been used to fry a dessert or something. Not only did it taste disgusting, but I am allergic to cinnamon, and having it in my food obviously isn't a good thing.  The time before that we had a fairly rude waiter.  Not sure why I kept going back. I guess because I had always enjoyed their food before. I love their bean dip and salsa, but I just can't go back anymore. I'm bummed, truthfully."}
{"text":"Holy moly this place was disgusting! Hahaha we still managed to have a fun date night, but I don't think we're coming back anytime soon. BUT the salsa was pretty awesome. Maybe I'll come back just for salsa?"}
{"text":"Well, we found a new favorite restaurant! We have been several times, I just never wrote the review. After seeing the commercial for this place, we decided to drive down and try it. The chips and salsa came as quickly on the 5th visit as they did the first visit. The restaurant is very cute inside, and we have greeted every time by friendly staff members at as we entered the restaurant. The margaritas get 9/10 limes as they are wonderful. They would have received 10/10's but the frozen strawberry margaritas served to the group had sugar on the rim. This family is a salt-on-the rim kind of family, and it would have been nice if the server had asked our preference. I love chile rellenos and of course ordered them here, and have had them each and every time since. Now, the first time I ordered these I wasn't as prepared for the amount of heat and punch the hatch chiles offered-even though I had been prepared/warned by the 3 chili listing on the menu which meant-prepare to sweat (my words not theirs). In other visits my friend asked for the green chiles on the side and this helped reduce the heat.Trust me if the menu states it is 3 chili hot, it is hot. Yummy for those of us that love the heat.      Only once did we have sub-par service, and of course it was when I took my mom there. I assured her that this waitress and her lackadaisical attitude was not the norm. 4/5 times we had remarkable service. The salsa is great and more is brought quickly when you run out. The food is tasty, and delicious. It is, as I said before, our new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has always been a long time place to bring the family. Service can be a little slow at times, but the food is delicious. Overall, we will always keep coming to this place. I recommend the Pollo Con Queso dinner."}
{"text":"Was really excited to come here on national margarita day with my friends, .99 cent margarita can't beat that! We were there from 5pm - 8 pm and the waiter brought out the drinks and food we ordered and only checked on us twice the entire time! Horrible service! Had to ask another wait for another drink and food boxes and had to walk up the check to get checked out. Usually we love coming here but tonight the service was Awful"}
{"text":"Although my in-laws thought it was just \"ok\", I like Arriba's. The atmosphere was nice, the service was solid and the food was good. I liked the salsa and the semi-spicy refried bean dip was quite tasty. My wife and I split a enchilada platter which was perfect for the two of us. (Although now that I think about it: the 9-year old twins didn't finish their kids meals which is a bit surprising since they both eat like horses.)  I do, however, think the prices were a bit high. By no means was it expensive, but certainly above what I was expecting. While made well, a at $9.99 - the margarita wasn't worth it.  Odds are, we'll be back (without the in-laws, I'm sure)."}
{"text":"The food here is above average to good. The mini chimis are good, the chicken is better than the beef. Most of the food is pretty good, nothing healthy about it keep in mind. It's a cool Mexican-American ambiance.   What makes this 4 stars then you ask? This is one of the best happy hours in Phoenix. 1/2 price their tasty and large appetizers and $2 (used be $1) Margaritas. Food is three-four stars, but their happy hour bumps them up to a solid four stars."}
{"text":"Hello Aribas! I just wanted to let you all know as a company not a particular location, that I love your food! There is just one thing that keeps me from coming back to your restaurants and that is your drinks.. I eat a lot of Mexican food and New Mexican style foods and when you go out to eat this type of cuisine, you want to enjoy a delicious margarita with it.. Sorry but your margaritas stink. Please update your recipes and make them flavorful and not all watered down and sour from all the sour mix... .  Seriously I'd go there more but the drinks are a terrible deal."}
{"text":"I should've known something was up when I stuck to the floor walking to my table. Service was friendly but the best part of my meal was the Diet Coke.   I got something with shrimp in hatch Chili cheese sauce. The shrimp tasted very old & both the shrimp & cheese tasted like they had been stored in a very dirty refrigerator.  I could actually taste the spoiled food & mold.  Hubby had a chicken burrito & was also suspicious  of the quality of the chicken.   I took leftovers home for the sole purpose of sending them to the health department if I got sick.   I will definitely avoid ever coming back here unless I drink enough alcohol to kill the bacteria I could taste in the food."}
{"text":"Our server Steven was great and very attentive, but the food was completely lack luster. The fajita meat was delicious, but the onion/green pepper mixture was almost non-existent. It was like charred remnants of onions/peppers with no actual substance.  We are avid restaurant goers, always looking for our favorites...but unfortunately, this place doesn't make the cut and we don't have plans to return."}
{"text":"I will give 5 stars for the customer service but 2 stars for the food. Vegetarians can avoid this place and will not regret not even a little. There were couple of items on the menu which were veggie but it was just normal bean and cheese. So I asked is there a vegetarian burrito ? Waiter responded sure I can whip something up. I was happy and asked him to add common veggies that I usually add like peppers, guac, sour cream, lettuce, pica de gayo and onions. I asked him make that in enchilada style with green sauce but he said green sauce has pork broth in it. So he asked what about just a Mexican rub. I have never heard about a Mexican rub so I said ok. Big mistake !!!  The rub was just raw heat and extremely bitter. Couldn't eat more than a couple of bites. Waiter saw me cringing and asked do you like it. I said no it is horrible. He said I can take it back and bring it without the rub. I appreciated that. He came back without the rub but it didn't matter the taste it self was horrible. It was like bunch of veggies stuffed in a burrito. Bad for your taste buds."}
{"text":"Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you."}
{"text":"It is mediocre at its finest.  Our server, Julius, was not cut out to be working with customers.  He reminded me of Kel Mitchell, from Nickelodeon's Kenan & Kel show.  Except, picture Kel, experiencing the terrors of tripping on pot.  Julius seemed way out of it, and exuded the enthusiasm of Ben Stein's character in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  My wife asked to taste the chile verde, and he brought us diced green chiles.  They blew our heads off!  The food was just food.  Nothing special.  I wont be back."}
{"text":"This may be the first review that I've awoken from a deep dream of peace to write.  Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...  Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!  That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and again  But I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says \"Signs point to yes\" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.  You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!  But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*  And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.  Osmoprep's got nutin on you, honey.  Montezuma's revenge me once, shame on you.  Montezuma's revenge me twice... we wont get fooled again"}
{"text":"I really like Arribas.  I go to the one over Camelback.  Very good service and the food is awesome.  Not so much at this location.  Although the service was excellent the food was sort of tasteless.  Not your normal flavorful Mexican meal.  Not sure I will return to this location again."}
{"text":"I think on most occasions, this place really deserves four stars. But thy can be inconsistent.  What we like; The chips and salsa with the bean dip are a winner. There are two different salsas; one with a little kick and one mild. The bean dip also has a little spice, which is refreshing. As a matter of fact, this is really the only Mexican place that has a little default spice in their dishes...not bland like so many other places. The selections are numerous, so they have a nice variety. $1 House margaritas during happy hour. The Steak Tampico is cooked very nicely and carries some real spice...super yummy.  What is not so great: The service is inconsistent in the bar area. I haven't had a problem in the dining area. I don't know if they assign to many tables to one person, or if they have a problem with people calling out, but it is definitely hit and miss.  The last visit there, the masa on the end tamale was hard...like rock hard. I am thinking that they nuke these things, since most places don't steam them to order, and got ridiculously carried away  It is worth a drop in, especially when the rush is not on. If they are busy, it is hit or miss."}
{"text":"The other night my husband and I came for a date night. My husband has always been big on this place but, I haven't. We always leave disappointed, this last time topped it off for me. We were sat and someone came up to us and got our drinks. Okay 20 minutes passes....no drinks. I flag a guy down and tell him and he says oh sorry I'm actually your waiter what do you want to drink. I was calm. Said my drinks  again seeing if he'd apologize. Of course not! So than! I try to say were ready to order and he already stormed off..... Fifteen minutes more we get drinks and I really wanted an appetizer but, didn't want to be there all night and realize i was glad I didn't order, their appetizer prices are entree prices. I believe that a plain cheese crisp was 5-6 bucks! Crazy! I ordered a pollo con Caso or something its similar to valle lunas fundidio.... (says my husband who was waaaay wrong) and asked for carne asada and was charged 3$ extra.. By the time we got it 30 minutes later. It was cold and the meat tasted like hamburger meat! Ewwwwwwww! I got one refill the whole time we were there.not by choice... I  was so upset and thirsty already ticked off I waited another 30 min for my bill! My husband asked for the 99 cent margarita and even pointed it out that the people next to us had it.... And he got a huuuuuuge one and then we told them it wasn't what we ordered and still had to pay for it my husband had two sips maybe because it was strong and he didn't like the taste! I finally had to hunt down the manager...I had to explain the situation....he didn't apologize just brought me my bill,.....didn't even comp us for the crap service food or wait times and we left. Glad to say I didn't tip! No way! Another thing e hostesses shirt was like see through and loose...she didn't leave any room for imagination and their outfits are cheesy anyways! Don't go Here! Pay the extra few bucks at Valle Luna or macayos......."}
{"text":"I tried out this Mexican restaurant because the Macayos on Litchfield has gone down in service and food. Arribas service is just as bad. The atmosphere is nice though. The food is ok, but nothing spectacular. We ordered sour cream enchiladas and all they did was put a dollop of sour cream on the bottom of the enchiladas. The margaritas are ok. I suggest trying a different Mexican restaurant. I'm still on the hunt for a really good one on this side of town."}
{"text":"We go there once a month or so and the food is always good and consistent. Today we had a little issue and the manager came over and took care of everything for us and had another server help us out. Fantastic service extremely nice people."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The best item I've tried on the menu is the White Sands Chimichanga. Seriously the only thing I get their. Fantastic every time. Also their chips and salsa as well as bean mix complimentary is amazing. We love this place and come here often as well as getting the same food over and over. Never gets old. Definitely try the White Sands Chimichanga if you haven't had it before. You will without a doubt love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very low budget! Margaritas in a plastic Dixie cup!!! Will not return. We were told because of budgeting. The server Josh was great,he made the visit good. Give him a raise!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, something for every palate.  The margaritas were generous and tasty.  The service was EXCELLENT.  Ask for Joaquín; he took the time to explain the specialty dishes,  even brought us out a taste of the filling and sauce for one of the dishes (White Sands Chimichanga-- highly recommend)"}
{"text":"Great place for take out orders. Food was hot and ready when promised. Food was delicious. They gave me enough chips and salsa to feed a family of four. More for me. :)"}
{"text":"Went there with my wife before shopping. Server was nice, but took forever between visits. Ordered fajitas and some enchiladas. Enchiladas were good, but very spicy. Fajitas were very tough. Couldn't even bite off a piece. Sent it back. Manager came over, but could hardly understand his mumbling. Reordered tacos. They were ok. Normally the returned item would be comped as would the replacement meal, as it was their fault. We had to pay for the replacement tacos. Overall a poor experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service were good. We were seated immediately near the outdoor seating area. We went with our children on Sunday when they offer kids eat for free. We ordered the White Sands chimichanga and shared it. It was delicious and large enough to share, good thing we did. Our older daughter ordered a chimichanga with red sauce and she enjoyed it as well. The kids meals did not skimp.   We enjoy this place with an authentic New Mexican flare. Try any recipe for hatch chiles and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food anywhere!!!!  Start off with a trio of salsas and chili bean dip with fresh chips...We have had several entrees and they are all good. Chorizo fundito and shrimp Monterey are off the hook. Mango margi yum like a drink and desert in one, worth every penny! Service was excellent and friendly!"}
{"text":"I live for the Arriba's peach margaritas, it is so delicious and at happy hour is decently priced. The flan is also to die for, I come here when I want to be put in a sugar induced coma. However, when I do come here, the people that are working really seem to not want to be bothered, this is a minor problem I have to deal with just to get the amazing drinks and desserts they have I guess! The decor is also really great, a half inside half outside area complete with a beautiful fountain and mood lighting. If you want authentic cuisine and ambiance, definitely give this place a try! But don't expect too much from your server..."}
{"text":"Not so good anymore, servers are awesome but food sucks now, grilled chicken used to be so delicious but now has a weird texture and ground beef has no spice or flavor.  And no more pretty margarira glasses.  So disappointed,  this used to be the best place to eat in Goodyear.  And the burritos only has about 1/4 c of filling. What a ripoff. They must wrap the burrito 4 times."}
{"text":"This place was one of my favorites but the service has gone to crap.  Our order took forever and it wasn't busy.  Half of our order was messed up. We ordered cheese dip for the chips and it came out with our food.  This place used to be the best....it's not on my list anymore."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in quality of service from the waitress and quality of food. Atmosphere was nice and great for visiting but the waitress really made this review bad for me. I would give them another shot."}
{"text":"Great food in very large portions. The nachos could feed 4 people. Service was so slow... we actually had to go up to the hostess and tell her we had been seated, but had no server come to the table yet. I would go again for the food."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. The bartender sucked, lame attitude, no silverware, never asked about food or needing another beer and basically not very friendly. The chips & salsa were pretty good, not great. The chicken fajitas were ok but typical, nothing to brag about. They need to make the beer colder and the staff warmer."}
{"text":"Arribas is located right off Camelback sadly location is a bit busy 24/7, but is one of my favorite Hatch Chile Mexican restaurants in the Valley. Happy Hour Pricing is very affordable.  Food; The spicy cream cheese dip by far is yummy, and highly addictive. Cheese crisp is large, crispy and great appetizer.    Service;  Yolanda was super friendly and very outgoing."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch. Had a friendly experience from the server, he was the nicest person ever. Also got to try something new there with help and recommendations, I did hold on the phone little bit to make my order but they were busy."}
{"text":"We have been to Arriba's several times now and yesterday for brunch was really good.  The food is fantastic, waiter friendly.   What made the experience so awesome was even though they forgot the appetizer that my son had ordered but apologized and came out with it pretty fast! We had two different waiters and the second was really up on things. They constantly asked \" do you need anything\"? Love the fundido sauce and walking out the door they all said \"thanks for coming, have a good day\"."}
{"text":"Went here last week while on a layover in Phoenix.  We had been shopping across the street at Last Chance. (separate review)  Arrived at 2pm.  Sad HH didn't start til 3.  :(  Oh well, paid full price for a nice tall Dos Equis draft.  Sad that their locally brewed beers were not available at this location.  Here's an idea, don't advertise them if you don't have them.  Received some chips, salsa & bean dip.  The chips needed salt & the bean dip was too runny.  Passed on the $4.99 lunch special of the day 2 beef tacos. (TUE special)  I instead went for a chicken enchilada layered dish with verde sauce.  The waiter warned me it was spicy.  I'm a fire eater so I said bring it on.  Man was it spicy!  No joke!  Some sour cream would have been good with it to tame the heat but I abhor paying $2.50 for a tablespoon of sour cream that is worth $.25.  Portion size of entree rice & beans was just right.  Not overly generous portion size.    Waiter & staff friendly enough.  Like the decor.  :)"}
{"text":"Came here to enjoy a nice Monday night drink and some appetizers. The food was great as always as always. Unfortunately we didn't get the awesome serve we are is to. The waiter was just too inattentive drinks took to long each time as we wanted and watched them sitting at the well for 10 min."}
{"text":"Went to Arriba's Mexican tonight for a friend's birthday dinner. Out of the six pages of choices I settled on this. For what I paid it wasn't worth it. The chicken was good and was topped with the fundido sauce. Which how can anything smothered in cheese sauce be bad?? Then there were three itty bitty shrimps wrapped in bacon. All three prob equaled the size of a medium shrimp. Then the kids or half size quesadilla and some rice for $13? Not worth it. glad the chips, salsa, and bean dip before filled me up some. Otherwise I would have left hungry. Service was just okay. Our server was very quiet and shy."}
{"text":"Deeeeelicious Nacho's. One plate can easily feed a party of 6 or more. Huuuge servings and there Margarita's have just the right kick... Excellent servers, very friendly with just the right amount of attention needed for a wonderful comfortable experience. we will return.."}
{"text":"So, after months of trying different Mexican Food places, I found my place. Because I'm a vegetarian it's hard to find a place that serves what I like. They made a veggie burrito that was SO perfect. Lots of veggies and spices and very tasty. The black beans were awesome and the presentation was perfect. Ken was our server and he knocked our socks off with all different kinds of salsas. The $5.00 margarita was really good with a plenty of alcohol and hand mixed. It was also a nice touch to have refried beans as a chip dip. Nice touch. On the way out, they brought us salsa containers for to take everything home. Really? Salsa containers. On a side note, we sat near the waterfall and it smelled fresh. Someone complained about the chlorine smell. It was there but it was no stronger than a pool. The seats were comfy and this is my New Mexican food home."}
{"text":"I was satisfied with our food and our server was very nice, but I had to practically arm wrestle the hostess for a booth. The look on her face when I asked for a booth - sheesh (I guess you had to see it), then she left in a huff to see if there was a booth, then a discussion to see if it was OK, lots of erasing on the floor plan, and then, finally....I was deemed good enough for a booth. Oh happy day. Good thing the place wasn't busy! I should have just left the place instantly, but I was there and hungry. With so many restaurants to choose from, no need to return."}
{"text":"Two visits to the location off the 202 great food and service each time. If you love or even moderately like green chili then you have to come here!"}
{"text":"Yahoo, I loved the food and service both times we have been there!!  You cannot beat the 99 cent Margaritas, and everything we have had has been excellent.  Come on people, give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Tonight we had a family gathering and went to Arriba because an Easterner was in town and wanted Mexican. What a huge disappointment! The food is insanely hot - even though we ordered \"mild\" dishes and the fish is nasty nasty nasty! We Arizonans are used to good fish tacos - and they exist up the road at Senor Tacos, but not here. Sorry, I can't understand how, in an area with a dozen really great Mexican places, how this gets by at all. Come to think of it, it wasn't busy at all so maybe the word is out! There are way too many great Mexican, non-chain places around to come here and waste your time and money. Oh, and there was no offer from management to to make the terrible food right, either!"}
{"text":"We love the food and the price point!  Best place to have a date night!    Things they can improve on include:  The decor needs updated on the inside and could be more modern/refined.   The drink/desert menus at the table are grimy and need redesigned.    Things we love: Chicken taco salad is awesome!  That's what I always get! My husband try's something new every time and he's like everything!  Happy hour deals are great! Margaritas are really good! Hardly ever a wait to be seated and food comes out fast!"}
{"text":"The food was just awful last time, my friends daughters chicken fingers were nearly burnt and never should have been sent out. The guacamole was nearly flavorless and we ran out of chips and salsa a few times because we were never checked on. Maybe we were there between shifts or at an off hour but I expect good service nonetheless. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We always end up going on a Sunday which is nice because they usually have a lady doing face painting and ballon animals. I think it adds a lot of fun to the day seeing kids sword fight with balloons. The staff are very friendly and can provide useful information about the menu items if you need help making your selection. The food, and of course the plates come out hot and always well prepared. They offer all the staple food including complimentary chips and salsa, which sometimes is hotter than you probably will be expecting. That could be good or bad for you depending on your heat tolerance. Demerits for a difficult parking lot to navigate and on really busy days you may be required to take a bit of a walk. In the summers this is not ideal. You may also find the dining space cramped, but it's never really bothered me, much. Great place for the whole family especially on a cool Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Looking for a New Mexico Cuisine Aribas is the best that I have had. The green Chile is authentic here and the service was great."}
{"text":"I have a regular lunch meeting here and the food is generally very mediocre and the service is too.  Last experience, I ordered the chicken salad and the lettuce was so old it was slimmy."}
{"text":"Not a great choice of mine.  We were up in Phoenix and needed to have a quick lunch and sort of was craving some Mexican.  The place was practically empty on a Wed. about noon time.  Maybe a clue.  At one time it was pretty popular place but seems to be going a bit downhill.  I had the fish taco lunch special.  Not so special at $7.99 but it seems now a days that is the way it goes.  I must say the fish (probably frozen) tasted fresh and grilled perfectly well.  It was large with two soft tortillas surrounding it.  Nice Baja sauce and lettuce, onions, and a tad of tomatoes.  Really pretty tasty.  I am a chip person and theirs was thin, crunchy and warm. Very nice.  .  I like the warm bean dip.  The regular salsa was a bit sharp and just so so.  The young lady who served us was sweet and attentive.  There is a lot of competition for good quality food in town. The place seemed a bit run down."}
{"text":"Not bad, not outstanding but not bad. Had the 99cent Margarita, well actually two. I usually get the ala carte burrito with both types of beef mixed. Also tried both the red and green sauce and added cheese. The beef was on the very salty side  hubby had two tacos and weak iced tea. His were salty too but again not bad. Service was very attentive and quick. They were getting busier as we left at 7 pm. I would go again if not for the salsa bean dip and chips alone"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Chips come with salsa and bean dip! The cheese crisp with hatch chili peppers gets the heat on early. Other dishes run the gamut for spice but it is all good. Cost is reasonable and service excellent. Even brought me a glass of milk to cook things down. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food as always!  The service was great and there is nothing better than authentic New Mexico cuisine!!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by a friend so we went for breakfast.   My husband ordered the taco plate and I had the breakfast tostada.   Both were delicious, and hot.   Service was great.   You get chips and salsa and bean dip too.   The salsa and bean dip were awesome...couldn't stop eating them!   We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I've been hearing the commercials for Arriba's for what seems like my entire life hahaha, but last night was my first time ever eating at one.    Pros: Friendly Service  Great complimentary Chips, Salsa and Bean Dip.  My wife enjoyed her (2) Cheese Enchiladas, said they weren't bad at all.   Cons: Disappointed and a bit over priced for my meal.  $14 for a chimichanga seems a bit much.  Also my chimichanga wasn't the best, the tortilla was extremely dry, even though it was soaked in red sauce.  The carne asada wasn't freshly cooked, you could tell it was cooked earlier and just thrown on the grill to warm up before going into the chimi.    The menus were dirty.  There was literally greasy finger prints all over the menus, I  had a hard time reading them because of all the grease smudged onto them.    The location just seemed a bit dirty.  I have no problems walking into the same decor from 1995 but they could use a deep clean in there.  Overall, I could possibly be convinced to come back but it wouldn't be my top choice."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer to this restaurant for years. Growing up in central Phoenix, the Camelback location was always a family favorite. I moved to north Scottsdale 3 years ago and found that this location was pretty on par with the Camelback location. About 6 months ago, my fiancé and I noticed that there were constantly new employees and the service and food quality was now hit and miss. Being a loyal customer, we have tried to continue dining at Arribas. Well tonight it was just awful. Stale chips, burnt cheese crisp, and rancid smelling/tasting chicken that was an odd color. The rice and beans seem to be a completely different recipe, tasting very bland. My fiancé ordered a side of sour cream and received it at the time we asked for our check. The bad experiences now out number the good experiences. We will definitely not be back. Save yourself the disappointment (and possible food poisoning) and steer clear of this location."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Service was okay, the food was pretty bad. Lots of cheese wrapped in tortillas regardless of what you order. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place, me and my friends started coming here for happy hour when the margaritas were 99¢ ! Now I think they're like 1.99 which is still good. We come every week faithfully Lol and we always ask to sit in Michael's section he always takes care of us and is so nice and friendly. We all think he's the best waiter ever! We  him"}
{"text":"I used to visit this location years ago and always liked the food. Today was the first time I'd been there in years and will be the last. We ordered the mixed burrito which was okay. Also ordered the kids beef taco and it was extremely greasy, give you a stomach ache greasy. My daughter also disliked the beans. Not to mention the worst service, our server checked on us once. He didn't even refill our waters. Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"My family and I had the worst experience at this restaurant! We felt like we were held hostage due to their system going down and only having a card to pay with. We waited well over a half hour for their \"system\" to get back up. We asked for a manager 3 times before he arrived at our table. Then he asked that we write down our card number and expiration date so it could later on be processed. The bill was only $25. Was it really that important for them to get their money instead of trying to keep their already annoyed customers who had been waiting for the \"system\" and waiting to speak to a manager? We did not feel comfortable leaving the card number, but did so any way. It was a terrible experience and we will never go there again."}
{"text":"3 Words... \"99 cent margaritas\" and 3 more \"half off appetizers\"!!!!  Enough said!   Oh, and did I mention you get bean dip with your chips and salsa? I think this may be the last place in town still doing that, and its a shame since it used to be much more common.  If you go, get there early, since it is usually packed for happy hour and the parking is abysmal.  Service was friendly and the 2 of us left \"Happy, full, and with food to go\" all for $20 ( minus the tip, of course).  Any place that can do that gets at least 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"My best friend and I love to go here for the happy hour $1 margaritas and talk about the week and enjoy an appetizer. All the food I've ordered has been so good! I've also gotten some party platters for family events and they did a great job. My only complaint is that sometimes the waiters forget about you and when ordering catering or food to go it takes longer than when you scheduled to pick it up so I'd recommend  asking for an earlier time like 30 minutes so you will get your food when you actually want / need it or just show up 30 minutes early to let them know you're waiting... you may have to remind them a couple times."}
{"text":"CHIPS and SALSA (2 kinds) and BEAN DIP all while you wait for your food.  Don't bother ordering appetizers, the chips and dips will satisfy you.  If you like margaritas, order the jumbo marg and sit in the nice air conditioned room.  Arriba is Mexican food, nothing fancy with a twist- just good ol' Mexican food.  You know the kind you eat and say \"why oh why did I just eat all that?\".  I come here ever so often.  I had the carnitas just recently and was was very happy with my meal.  Have Fun!  Prices range anywhere bettwen $9-$15ish."}
{"text":"Overall, not a bad dining experience... but nothing was exemplary about it either.  I'll go back.  I am fairly consistent with what I order when trying new places that are similar to other places that I have previously been to.  What I mean by that is that unless something is highly recommended by other Yelpers, then I will typically get the steak tacos at a Mexican restaurant... and that way I can, in my own way, compare each restaurant to the others.  Anyway, there was only a very brief wait to get seated... and the service was really attentive, coming back to check on our meal, and filling up our waters often (always a big plus in my book)."}
{"text":"Arribas is great! The chips are fresh and both salas and the bean dip are delicious. I had the white sands chimichanga - it was so good!"}
{"text":"Bean dip and salsa was quite enjoyable. A little expensive but worth it. Guacamole was awesome very sweet. The food was fast and really delicious, and the food presentation was nice. They even put the sour cream and guacamole in little bowls made out of chips. Our server was friendly and very helpful, making sure our meal was enjoyable. To end the meal we ordered the fried ice, which was amazing. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"A cut above the norm. We had a delightful meal with fast, friendly, professional service. Portions are very large, enough to take home. Restaurant is located in a convienent area with plenty of parking. This seems to be a very popular place with the younger set."}
{"text":"Meh, whatever.  Their food is just OK.  All of their sauces are cooked with flour, so that eliminates most of the dishes I enjoy at a Mexican restaurant and the dishes I have had that don't contain flour are just OK.  I do not enjoy their beans and rice and their prices are pretty high for lunch, around $10/plate.  In summary, a sub-par Mexican spot, like most."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is awful. My boyfriend and I stopped in around 11:00 this morning to grab a bite to eat before getting some shopping done. It wasn't busy at all, maybe a hand full of tables. The hostess greeted us pretty much right away and was very nice. She sat us in the bar area, just a few feet from the bar itself. The chips, salsa and bean dip came out pretty quickly and that seems to be where the decent service ended. We saw a few employees and the manager walking around but pretty much ignoring us. One of the servers who had been shuffling (literally shuffling. Would not pick her feet up when she walked) around walked by our table several times while coughing and apparently trying to hack something up (So. Gross.). We watched her walk over to the bar, right next to open containers of limes and lemons and cough all over everything. Didn't even attempt to cover her mouth. It was so ridiculous that it was almost comical and I looked at my boyfriend and said \"Oh my God please don't let that be our server.\" Jinxed. Not 15 seconds later she shuffled up to our table. She didn't greet us or tell us her name or even smile for that matter. She looked so irritated with the idea of helping us and just said \"What can I get you to drink?\". My boyfriend and I both ordered waters and I also ordered a mimosa. She walked the whole 10 steps to the bar, got our waters and put them on the table without saying another word and just walked away. Another 15 minutes passed and the bartender came over to take our order. She didn't appear to be as annoyed as the 1st server but she wasn't exactly friendly. I still hadn't gotten my mimosa and pretty much realized that the 1st server hadn't even put the order in. I ended up just getting a Pepsi and we ordered our food. During the 20 minutes we waited for our meals, we continued to see employees walking around but not helping anyone (not to even ask if we wanted refills), the busser who brought us more chips had earbuds in and never said a word to us. We thanked him and he turned away without even looking at us. So unprofessional. The shuffling server went over to the bar twice to pick up drinks that had been just sitting there for 10-15 minutes. Our food came out and looked delicious but was anything but. My boyfriend got the breakfast skillet which was 80% onions. I ordered the 2 enchilada plate with shredded chicken. The rice was dry and completely inedible, the beans were ok but I was only given a couple tablespoons of them. The enchiladas seemed ok at 1st but they were drowning in sauce so it was hard to taste anything else. I got to the middle of the 1st one and noticed the chicken looked pink. I thought maybe it was thigh meat that had been close to the bone. I took another bite and noticed the flavor was off so out of an abundance of caution, I opened up the enchilada to check and there was a ton of pink meat. I opened up the 2nd enchilada and noticed the same thing. I just stopped eating at that point. Our server brought our check over and said \"I don't want to rush you but I'm gonna go ahead and leave this here so you're not waiting on me.\" Well that would have been really thoughtful if not for the fact that it took her 15-20 minutes to come back and pick up our card. Now to top off the whole thing, I've been throwing up since about an hour after we left there. Horrible service, disgusting food and now vomiting. I have no idea how this place it still open. And whoever the manager was, was clearly more interested in following the hostess around everywhere than actually checking in on his customers. He has no business being a manager. Eating gas station sushi would have been a safer choice than this dump."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!! The only reason I am giving one star is because I can't give 0. We recently moved to the area and wanted to find a good Mexican restaurant. When we first walked in I thought it might be decent. The special drink was a 24oz margarita for 9.99. The decor was colorful and festive but as we approached our seats I noticed that they were ripped and warn looking. My hubby and I ordered the special margaritas and a bowl of guacamole that was $7.00. We were served free chips, salsa and spicy bean dip. I wanted to order a chile Rellano but they are made with Hatch chiles and super hot so I went with the taco platter with shredded beef. My son ordered the chile verde and my husband ordered a ground beef chimichanga. Both my husbands and mine were super greasy. In fact I could squeeze the grease out of the taco. My sons chile verde was spicy but ok. A small portion made to look bit by sitting on top of green goo and pork fat. Basically we all hated this food. I have never given such a low rating before. To top it off our bill for 3 people was $79. That's dinner for 3 and 2 Margaritas. My son had water. I don't mind paying for good food but this is anything but. I will never ever ever set foot in this or another Arriba grill again. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Rubio's where you will get much better quality good for a way better price. Oh and did I mention I hated this place??  On a side note the only bright part of this visit was the excellent service."}
{"text":"Was at a event at Westworld and we drove around looking for a place to eat and came here about 8pm on a Saturday.  Not a lot of people inside, especially for a Saturday but we were hungry.  When the waitress came over she was very nice and chatty.  She took our orders and repeated everything back to assure she got it right, that's a good thing!  Problem is than we waited and waited for our drinks and chips & salsa.  I am use to getting chips & salsa as soon as you sit down not 15 minutes after you have seated and ordered.  When we saw her come out with our drinks and chips she first went to another table and chatted for a little than came over and dropped off our stuff.  I figured she could have dropped our stuff off than chatted with the other customers.  When our food came, it was good.  Nothing spectacular.  I had just truck tacos and got lots of steak with it.  My mom got hard taco and enchilada and enjoyed hers.  We also ordered mini apple chimi with ice cream.  I think that was the best of the meal.  If I come back to this area may try out other restaurants before I make another visit.  Fun to try new places and see what another city has to offer!"}
{"text":"What a f$!%#ing shame. Ordered queso and salsa with chips To Go. It was extremely over priced at $15. It took me 10 mins to drive here then I waited around for 15 minutes....for some chips n salsa -_-  I got my order and decided to check it before driving off. To my surprise the queso was barely anything. Like 6 tablespoons. Went back inside to ask them to fill the container all the way since I paid $15.   It took another 20 minutes, talking to the manager and an extra .54   I won't be going back to this Arribas."}
{"text":"Everything has gone downhill at this location. Most recently we ordered a kids cheese crisp which was clearly microwaved. The worst part was watching the bus boy sweeping the floor and then the seats of the booths. I don't even want to checkin for my last visit."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in town. Super cheap beer and food. You'll have enough leftover to take home for tomorrow's lunch. The downfall with this location is that the bar is super small -- only five seats. There are a few cocktail tables, but the lounge/bar area is definitely lacking. I'll head over if I'm by myself, but if I'm meeting people and want to sit at a bar, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like this place for the most part. I find the service good and have never had a problem with the staff. They have great chips with salsa and beans to eat before the food comes which always tide the family over while we wait. They have $.99 margaritas and they also have jumbo ones (I love the big strawberry margarita... awesome.) My go-to entree is the two tacos with rice and beans. The first time I came here I loved the service and food but the last two times I came, my food came and it wasn't hot and fresh the way I'd expect a restaurant to serve it. Then again, I suppose they do have to wait until everyone's food is ready to serve everyone all at once. A definite family favorite of our family"}
{"text":"My fiance is orignally from New Mexico and ever since we've been together (5years) he always always talks about green chiles and how much he misses new mexico style cooking. Me being from California Ive only had mexican food that's been Cali-forni-a-ized, although a year ago my fiance started school in AZ and him and his mom (who also is from new mexico) found this place and fell in love with it.  They told me about it and so on my next trip down to AZ I went and Aye Dios Mio its magnificante! I love! this food, and not only that but their margaritas! WHOA! After eatting a meal like they bring you its hard to finish it. They bring you chips and salasa and BEANS with Green Chilies in it omg the beans are soooo good you forget all about the salsa.   The only 1 bad thing was when I went one time and they had $1 margaritas during happy hour they tasted as if they were virgin margaritas, I know sometimes I dont look myy age so I asked the waiter if it was a virgin and he said no, and I said to just take it back and get me a big one then cause the 2 ppl I was with as well as myself didnt taste a drop of alcohol in that thing,   But with that being said I still gave 5 stars cause Ill go back anytime!!!"}
{"text":"Service -- not so much. :( Food - - we just stopped in for nachos, and they were super cheesy.  Margarita - - 99c during happy hour 3pm-6pm. Meh! Tasted like a lot of sour mix, but what can you expect for 99c, right?   The nachos were $11.99, but then marked down $2 to $9.99 for happy hour.   Needless to say.. we've had better nachos. But really the lack of service will prevent us from coming back.   What were we thinking? :)"}
{"text":"last night I went to the Glendale location with a group of 12 girls before going to the movies. some girls were there an hour prior to my arrival there. when I got there it was 6:43pm. I knew the happy hour was over at 7pm so was wanting to get an order in. after sitting for 10min the server (Joaquin) comes over at 6:53pm. we still had no water, chips or salsa at this time. we say we would like to order for happy hour and he rudely says \"well you have about 2 minutes\" in a way like telling us to hurry up. we simply said we had been here for 10minutes and were trying to order when he snapped back \"ive been coming around the table and you weren't here\". which wasn't true at all. I understand that it was busy but that was no excuse to snap back rudely at us and blame us. throughout our time there he was not very present. never had our waters refilled. then when paying my cousin and I asked if he could split our check on 2 cards. the total + tip was $30.74. when he ran our cards and returned them we were each charged $20.12 + $3.28 for tip. we then had to talk to the manager for being wrongly charged. during this 7 people from our group went to the bar to take a shot. they stood for 13 minutes never being acknowledged or served at all so ended up walking away without any drinks. the service was overall terrible and would keep me from wanting to return to a place I once enjoyed going to."}
{"text":"A favorite lunch spot of mine.  If you get there before 11:30 am they have a \"recession friendly\" menu where almost everything on the lunch menu is $5.95.  Quite a deal considering the portions."}
{"text":"This was the 4th Mexican Food place we tried on the west side after moving here and we have been coming back ever since.  Good chips and salsa with bean dip.  New Mexican entrees and traditional Mexican dishes as well.  Good service and a nice big dining area."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, I haven't been to Arriba's before... I know! Anyway, I went to Arriba's with a large group at lunch time. It started out a bit rough, as the hostess 'forgot' to give us lunch menus and only gave us the the full priced menus.... hmmmm. We requested and received the lunch menus. The prices at lunch are decent with most plates being under 10$. The portions were also generous. I like that they give you bean dip and salsa with the chips. For lunch, I tried the New Mexican enchiladas, with a mix of green and red chili. It was fairly tasty, though a bit on the salty side. It seemed to be pretty standard Mexican fare. I would definitely consider returning at lunch time, but I felt their prices were high for dinner."}
{"text":"It's gross, the food was awful. The server was very nice and prompt. The staff was piled up at the front entrance talking about inappropriate stuff about relationships and other things. We were seated fairly close To them and could hear their entire conversation."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, yesterday's visit was one of the worst dining experiences I've had during my 10 years in Phoenix. The food was sub-awful (seriously, a cheese crisp that a 7-year-old deems inedible?), the service was terrible (zero smiles, and I had to basically tackle our server get the check, much less some refills on water glasses), and the atmosphere was equal to that of the third lunch shift at a nursing home.  I won't go back. Ever."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in recent visit. They used to have the best bean dip around, but now not so.  Food has gone way down.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I eat at Arriba's all the time and I love it. I have never had a bad experience at any of the locations although I like the Scottsdale restaurant the best! I guess I just enjoy an all-around great meal and don't get excited when all is not perfect. Come on, people, could you do better?"}
{"text":"Very good food and service!  Chips and salsa are served with refried beans, which we love.  Recommended for an americanized mexican meal."}
{"text":"Really good service. Quick, efficient and pleasant.  Food had nice presentation, was hot and drink refills came quickly. Plates weren't overly garnished and I love the sour cream in a mini fluted tortilla bowl.  Cute decor, I'm sure the out of town folks eat up the Mexico theme.  Food was ok. Sort of bland. Not great, not horrid. I'll give it another try for sure."}
{"text":"I came here with bunch of coworkers on a Thursday evening during happy hours.  The margaritas are cheap during happy hours, only 99 cents!  This place gives you complimentary chips + salsa + bean dip. The chips are crispy, fresh and tasty. The salsa and bean dip are not anything exceptional.  I tried the supreme nachos. It could've been better. They definitely put lots of toppings and meat on it. I felt like it was very greasy (but I expected it to be). It can be soggy near the end of the dish because all the cheese and meat soaks in it. The beef is just ground beef. Everything is stuck together so sometimes it is hard to share. It does come with a lot of ingredients on top like sour cream, guac, jalapenos.  The cheese crisp is interesting. It reminds me of a tortilla pizza with just cheese on it. Nothing exceptional.   Service is mediocre. I think since our party was big, it was difficult for the waiters to see what's going on. They tried to refill our drinks but they weren't always on top of everything. They didn't ask us for refill for chips and salsa but we definitely kept requesting for much. I always like complimentary chips and salsa (how can you go wrong?!)  Parking can be an issue before 6pm because sometimes the parking lot gets full but some people park at the other parking lot close by after 6pm. There's a sign regarding it."}
{"text":"Absolutely atrocious service, while there were only three tables of customers at 7pm on a Saturday night.  To top it off, the waiter was a smart ass when, after 15 minutes of his being MIA, we inquired as to his whereabouts when we wished to order more drinks & food.  On the plus side, the food was fine and arrived quickly (even before the chips and salsa appetizer?)."}
{"text":"No stars! Walk to the restroom and see the salsa and so called bean dip sitting on the counter with the dirty dishes and other cleaning equipment. I should have left then. Seriously on the cusp of calling the health dept on them."}
{"text":"Chili rellano was delicious. I asked for one with breakfast and they did it for me. Breakfast was great! Our server Cassie was amazing, and I was a server so I mean GOOD! They asked to make the 5 year old with us a smoothie or ice creme! FREE. Chips and Salsa were good, atmosphere was fun, full bar, kid and family friendly. Clean clean restrooms and restaurant. Free samples of microbrew beer! Yum yum yum! Under $50 for 4 people for brunch, huh? Oh but I left a $20 tip! Grrrrreat."}
{"text":"*pffffffft*  That's how you spell the sound of a fart.  And that's exactly what I did for 2 days this week, after my trip to Arriba. It's basic Mexican fare.  We had a group of about 12 and they were great taking care of us.  I never had to ask for my iced tea to be refilled.   The food?  We made a list at work ahead of time and ordered it right before we left the office.  I ordered the fish taco dish.  It came with a side of refried beans and rice.  The beans were nasty and then I realized they probably weren't vegetarian, so I only had a bite and put them aside.  The rice was...rice.  The only way it had any flavor was because I had doused it with hot sauce.   The fish taco?  No flavor!  The fish was grilled, but I could barely taste it.  Everything was covered in some sort of white sauce and it was all that flavorful, but still covered up any flavor that *could* be in the fish taco.  I still prefer Two Hippies. The service was great, but it was really the only thing memorable.  I doubt I'd go back there.   *pffffffffffffft*"}
{"text":"I don't know what's happened but this place has gone from my favorite area Mexican food joint to I don't know when I will ever go back.  Last few times I have gone the service has been terrible, food is kinda bland even with hatch chilies, chips are room temperature and we asked twice for the hot salsa and got a salsa that was just as tame as the regular salsa they serve. And the size of burritos has slowly gone done over the years.  To be fair to my server yesterday it appeared that he had the entire north side of the building but we only got refills once and had to ask bussers for items twice.  2 1/2 stars would be more accurate."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, but not great. We got there just in time to take advantage of the .99 margarita's, but the food wasn't anything super special. The salsa was knock your socks off hot, which kind of numbs your tastebuds to other flavors and everything was very peppery, which I'm not a huge fan of. I got the chicken tostada and the hubby got the chicken picado, which were both pretty good. The bean dip was awesome and the service was fantastic though.  I think we'll go back sometime to try out other dishes to try to get that rating up a bit. If you go for happy hour then the prices are very reasonable..."}
{"text":"Two visits in one trip, first and last.  Food so so at best, ok if you are hungry but don't drive out if your way,"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night for dinner. The restaurant was definitely not very busy but the service was very slow. I would not recommend going there on a Friday or Saturday night when they are crowded.  That being said, the free chips and salsa / bean dip were awesome! The mini taquitos just okay but the queso they came with was wonderful. My husband got the sampler platter and was disappointed (it was just a bunch of mini fried appetizers). I had the stuffed pepper and it was good, but nothing I'd crave again. We saw other tables' food go by and some of the more traditional meals (burritos, enchiladas) looked delicious. They also had relatively cheap beers and everyone we saw with margaritas seemed to be enjoying them.  We will be back. Not when we are craving authentic Mexican cuisine but when we want something easy and cheesy and spicy. If you are wanting gourmet Mexican you should stay away from chain restaurants. If you are wanting good ol' Tex Mex at a decent price, hit up Arriba (unless of course it is a Friday or Saturday night, then steer clear!)."}
{"text":"BEWARE! This is not only a bad restaurant, but really a danger to everyone! We went in and the first thing we noticed was a musty mildew smell. should have left, but WE DIDN'T.  The waiter was very polite, took drink orders and said \"don;t get anything with the ground beef because it is rancid and people are puking\"! I said \"it is still on the menu?\" at he said \"the manager did not want to pull it in case someone wants ground beef\".    ARE YOU KIDDING ME??  We were really hungry and STUPID and stayed, but did not order the ground beef. The chips were cold when brought out.  Get this: We ordered a 2 taco combo, 2 taco combo, and 1 enchilada with rice and beans. There was about 3 tbs of rice and 2 tbs of beans on each plate! I asked the waited and he said that they were running low and rationing. We had a coke, a beer and a .99 cent Margarita and the bill for this mess was $67.96!  Not only will I never go again, but I contacted the board of health!  I risked my life and wallet to get nothing!"}
{"text":"I forgot to mention the rim of my margarita glass had alot of missing glass."}
{"text":"Margarita was great! The chips and salsa was good! my husband loved his dinner but I had the fish tacos and for me it was just ok. I  decided to go out of my comfort zone and try something different and this choice I wasnt pleased with..I will go back and try something different but I wasnt so pleased with my choice!  The waiter was great and helpful.."}
{"text":"Don't come here.  The hostess sat us in an area that had no server assigned to it. The server we got was bad. The  service was very slow despite only 5 other tables with people.  The kitchen supposedly lost the ticket the server gave them. The food was mediocre.  Overall a very poor dining experience.  Sad because this place was very good."}
{"text":"Well arribas is finally battling back. A couple of years ago sheriff Joe shut em down by taking all their cooks and wait staff and shipping them back to their homeland. The current staff is friendly and a quick.  Food is tasty and the Margaritas are cold and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Not impressed whatsoever. Went on a Friday before it got packed and it still took 15-20 minutes just to get our drinks. While I liked the price, I did not like the margarita. Our waiter took other people's food order before ours even though we were seated first. When placing our food order the waiter kept trying to walk away when I was not done ordering. The food was ok but I've definitely had better. We'll be sticking to Tia Rosas."}
{"text":"Love Arriba's Lunchtime Specials and friendly staff. Very good new mexico-style Mexican food. Fresh and delicious. Would highly recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and When I first arrived I was seated in a booth then changed over to a table For comfort!  Their booth was too small for a plus size woman, and the seat was terribly uncomfortable.  While I was at the booth I had one waiter and once  I moved he tried to come with me to that table but then came another waiter! They were confused on who was taking care of me so they both were bringing me things! But they finally got that straightened out! Chris was my waiter and he was very attentive, super sweet kid, and he did a great job even though he charged me for a drink I didn't order but, he quickly fixed the problem! So I was pleased with his service!  Also the hostess was extremely kind and had great customer service.   The food was really good!  The restaurant brings chips and salsa to your table but they also bring a bean dip which was a little bland by its self but was really good with the queso!  As for my order I only had the Queso Fondido which was really tasty! And the presentation was nice! They light it on fire before serving it.  The order of queso was too large for just one person and I'm not big on wasting food, so with the queso, bean dip and salsa with chips, that was more than enough food for me! However, I did order a frozen Margarita and it was Amazing!  The menu had pictures, which I liked!  I'm very visual.  The restaurant itself was clean, and decorated with a lot of bright colors. A very comfortable, casual vibe!  The only reason I didn't give it high stars is because they could use a little update, the food was good but not amazing, (but to be fair, I didn't try an entree)  and the service was good but a little chaotic!  But a good place for lunch!"}
{"text":"It's not awful, but nothing really wowed me about this place. The chips and salsa are good, and their white jalapeno sauce on my chimi was great. The drinks, although HUGE, were pretty watered down and not alot of kick to them. Probably not somewhere I would recommend to anyone for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Was searching for a restaurant and happened to take a wro g turn and get to this place, being nearest. We were starving so just went with this choice. The chips, bean dip is complimentary was great!  Food was okay, for me not worth the price. Two of us with just 2 entrees paid $30. Overrall, OKAY!"}
{"text":"Wife and I tried Arriba on our short trip to Arizona...and my overall experience was it was okay.  Nothing really blew me away.  We first ordered the Nachos for appetizers which were good, nothing special, but good.  It was also huge in portion size!  Could feed about 6 people!  I then ordered the Carne Asada which, eh, was just okay.  We may visit this place again to give it another try.  In summary, okay food, okay service, okay prices."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time and I have to say that I was not impressed with the service.  The food was actually pretty good.  I purchased a Groupon for $10 that gave you $20 off any food purchase.  I double checked the fine print and all that was stipulated was \"one per table, dine in only\".  So we ordered the Fajita special for two.  After all was said and done they argued with me that the Groupon could not be used on any \"specials\".  I explained that I specifically checked the fine print and no where does it say that.  Well, after arguing with the waitress, she send over the manager in training to argue some more.  Then finally after she went back the the manager, manager they accepted the offer and took off the $20.  Rightfully so, but I had to be embarrased and made to feel like a criminal over using one of their offers."}
{"text":"Meh, service was decent, vegetarian options were not that great. Water was tap, and the food was not fresh. Nothing special about this place, but it did not make me puke.  Had the vegetarian enchiladas and they were not that flavorful.  Price for lunch menu was cheap, under $10.   Would I go again? No. If someone took me there, would I go...sure..."}
{"text":"uggg - took 10 min to have someone come take our drink order, another 10 min to get our sodas and take our food order, then a half hour later still no food. We were on our lunch break and finally had to ask for our food to go and a check. It took another 10 minutes to get our check and our food. Small portions, food was ok. Probably wont go back"}
{"text":"The food was so-so and the service was VERY slow. Need to figure it out if they are going to last here! Taco Tuesday ends at 4pm (kind of a bummer) but the 99 cent margaritas were fairly decent!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here.  The menu is a bit different from the traditional Mexican restaurant.  My kids wouldn't like it because they don't like anything different.  My wife and I thought it was very good.  We will go again.  Food quality was outstanding.  Everything was well prepared and made with good quality ingredients.  Service was friendly and very competent."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on Friday while in the area. The food was just ok that is why 3 stars. If i could give stars for service only, it would be 5 stars! James was our waiter and he was totally on the ball. That kid made it a great experience. Thanks James!"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are very good. They also give you a bean dip for the chips.The hatch chile relleno, $10.99, is spicy so be warned. They also offer a poblano chile relleno and that one is more mild. At breakfast they offered a $2.99 Bloody Mary in either spicy or not. The spicy is delicious. They offer huge Margaritas for $6.99. The spinach enchiladas $9.99, are more cheese than spinach but are still very good. For beans you can get either refried or charro beans. The Charro beans are spicy whole beans. The refried beans are made with chicken base, but no lard. Be warned of the servers who try to upsell you on sour cream $1.99 and guacamole $2.49 with your combo or entree. It's just a side portion. Overall it's a place I will definitely return to. I really appreciate their outside patio."}
{"text":"Service was a tad slow as we were sat in the back room and I think he kept forgetting about us but.. .the fajitas were decent and hot, the queso dip was hot and good as well. I guess everything was just a-ok. Not spectacular, not horrible. Chips were crispy but the bean dip was watery. Hot sauce was good too."}
{"text":"The Good:  In the past, we have often enjoyed Arriba.  They offer good chips, excellent queso and always pleasant service. The real reason to choose Arriba however, was their terrific Tortilla Soup.  When in the mood for homey, satisfying soup, it was the place to go! By far and away, offering the best homemade Tortilla Soup in the entire Phoenix Valley.  The Bad:  On last visit, the price on a bowl of tortilla soup hadn't changed but, the portion certainly had!! When soup arrived we were in disbelief. Barely a large cup, much less than a \"bowl\" of soup.  I asked our attentive waitress what had happened to the size of their portion?  She could only nod her head in silent understanding. While Arriba's was always a little pricey for local Mexican food, it now appears, instead of raising their prices, they chose to cut back on portion size. Duping the customer into thinking nothing has changed, does not promote loyalty. I gave two stars because the recipes are still very good, but they have lost our loyal business, skimping on a $7.00 bowl of broth!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night, we were seated almost immediately. Chips and salsa brought out quickly, drinks refilled often, waitress was AMAZING. The only thing is the Chile relleno was advertised as a 3 Chile item (one of the most hot on menu) and there was no heat. Super delicious either way ! Would come back again"}
{"text":"If your from New Mexico you should know that this place has no New Mexican owners or anything despite the flags outside. But, me and my wife have deemed this place New Mexico worthy (Las Cruceans ourselves)."}
{"text":"Best service yet, our waitress Stevie is awesome, fast, knowledgeable, friendly & feisty. First check in but been here many times, food is always great!"}
{"text":"after shopping at the costco next door for 8 years we finally decided to try out arriba.  what a stupid idea.  it was 8:30 so it wasn't crowded.  when we sat down we immediately asked for water and nobody brought it.  when the server came we asked her for water but she had chips with her.  5 minutes later someone else brought it and we were even more thirsty.  did i mention that it wasn't crowded?  right when we walked in they sat us down.  after the water came and we downed it she finally came to take our order.  we ordered and i noticed that they have their own microbrew beer so i asked for a sample of one of them before i ordered a 22 ouncer.  food came pretty quickly but there were only two place settings and she didn't bring me the beer sample- i had to remind her. she brought the settings but no sample.  she brought the sample and left.  when we were most of the way through our dinner she came to ask if i liked the beer?  who cares?  i'm not ordering one now anyway!!!!  i will say that the food was good but this is about the whole experience.  when she finally came to ask if we wanted a desert we asked for stuffed sopapillas and she left.  then our kids changed their mind so i told them to go find her.  they were gone for 5 minutes and came back to tell us that they couldn't find her.  they left again and couldn't find her so came back.  then she came back to tell us that they were out of sopapillas!!  cool, so we order what the kids want and she leaves.  5 minutes later she comes back and tells us again that they are out of sopapillas and we look at her and say \"yeah, that's why we want the other thing...\"  she brings it another 5 minutes later and finally brings us our bill.  i put my card on it, we wait, the kids get restless and the family decide to go wait outside.  only then did she come take my card to pay.  way to make a good first and last impression.    We are never ever ever, going back to Arriba.   You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me.   We are never ever ever, going back to Arriba"}
{"text":"The place looks nice from the outside, but the food and drinks are horrible. Seemed like a great spot for happy hour... We ordered the hatch chili cheese crisp, and it was inedible. Then we thought we'd have some 99 cent margaritas, because we saw the commercial, but it was basically just watered down urine from the homeless guy who wanders between Ray and Chandler. If you're looking for good Mexican food, you should go to Los Taquitos over on Elliot or head up to Old Town Scottsdale to Los Olivos."}
{"text":"Arriba Mexican Grill is consistently good. The weekday specials make it even better. You can't beat Taco Tuesday where regular ground beef tacos are only 99 cents. Chicken Chimichangas on Thursdays are another delicious deal at just $2.99 each. Chips, salsa, and bean dip come as soon as you sit down. The staff is friendly and fast.  If you do choose to order from the menu, there's plenty to choose from. The prices are a bit high but the meals I have had were all worth it. Do note that most sides also cost extra, which again can add up. Just be aware of this and decide if you are REALLY gonna eat that beans and rice, eh?"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had in my life. We thought it might be a fluke, went back a second time and it was the same experience. We waited over twenty minutes both times before even getting a drink. Then our appetizers came out after our main course."}
{"text":"Nothing was especially bad here, but neither was anything notably good.  I suppose they brought refills of salsa & chips without asking, which was nice.  Portions are rather modest in size, and prices are a little high for what it is (entrees here).  Drink prices were very reasonable though.  Just doesn't have a nice feel to the place, cleanliness and overall vibe.  Feels like a Spring Break party place except the patrons are older."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere!  Nice menu selection. David the waiter was great.  Drinks are huge but don't taste much alcohol!  Better Mexican places..."}
{"text":"Hit & Miss. The things that are good are great - and the other things are well... lacking -_-  BY FAR The spotlight here are the drinks.  Margaritas in any flavor and any size are always a great deal for their size! ***** Margaritas **** Price ****Selection ***(-)**** on flavor. (some dishes can be bland) *** Atmosphere  *** Service - kind of hard to get anyone's attention."}
{"text":"Great food I had in house beer and my wife had a blue zaldo order a nacho supremeo all I can say is WOW so huge our waitress was awesome very helpfull with drinks and food looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"We left Macy's with two drinks on the table in order to come here. Superior in every way. The drinks are tasty and made with quality ingredients and the food is much more authentic and delicious.   They give you chips, salsa and bean dip at the start so that you can end with left overs. Oh, and they brew their own beer! Little hoppy for my taste, but nothing that a solid Margarita or Dos Equis can't fix.  The Guac is legit, and the servers are fantastic.  Get in here!"}
{"text":"I was interested in checking out Arriba as I heard of the hot hatch chilies. Even after reading the mixed reviews we took s shot and headed over for dinner.   Chips & cocktails:  beer from tap was flat. Yup, flat. Don't see that everyday when going to a restaurant. Beer replaced with bottled variety.   Grande margarita ( house mix) was giant for $6 but I would have preferred my buddies flat beer. Nice size but nit very good and certainly not worth 1000 calories!!!    I drink a lot of slim-priced booze & was still not impressed.   chips average, salsa bland, refried beans were the only added pleasure.    Dinner:  my friend was not psyched with the cheese skin that arrived with his enchiladas. Creamy? yes, Shiny with weird skin?  Yes, Good?  No.   Combo plate with green corn tamale was dry. Chicken enchilada was pretty good and seemed to have s lot of pepper seasoning. Thank god I asked for green sauce which saved the tamale. Rice and charro beans typical & moist.    In a nutshell, when should have taken heed from the yelp 2 star reviews.  Food was less than average. Much better quality, pricing and taste at Chipoltle."}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be a five star rating; but alas the decor and ambience didn't make up for mediocre food. I ordered fish tacos with the understanding they were made with grilled grouper.  When I could find the fish (a search was required because of the mounds of lettuce and cheese) it was a piece of gray matter that was passing as fish. I will give kudos to the waiter;  he was attentive and knowledgeable but my daughter's margaritas was all mix and he offered no apology or explanation. There are too many good Mexican restaurants in Gilbert;  avoid this one."}
{"text":"Never been to this location, and honestly hadn't been to Arribas in years. I'll say it's nice inside, staff very friendly, Our waitress was awesome Brenda I believe was her name. She stayed on top of our drinks, made sure we were taken care of. I honestly could not recall what I thought of the food prior to this visit, and I'm guessing I didn't care for it then and don't care for it now either. I ordered the Pollo con queso, and I was literally grossed out by the cheese, it peeled away in one big piece,  I literally only ate the inside of the chimi's because the tortilla was chewy, I didn't bring it to the waitresses attention though, my rice was mostly green onion, the beans were good the only thing I liked on my plate. My husband ordered the Machaca chimi, he said it wasn't that bad but nothing to rave about our say let's go back, which I'm glad cause I didn't like it."}
{"text":"My in laws, from New Mexico, love this place. Seeing how it is focused on \"New Mexican\" cuisine, I think that alone says alot.  Quite frankly, I liked the food better than most \"Mexican\" or local restaurants here in Las Cruces - which says something as well. I had the Rio Grande Enchiladas with carne adobada - smothered in queso fundido - it was awesome!  No one at the table had a complaint, we had nothing but compliments for the food.    Also, interesting and encouraging side note - the waitress said when she was hired, part of the training was to have the wait staff try ALL dishes on the menu.  Seems like common sense, but not having worked in the industry (unless you count Taco Bell and a sub shop in high school) it seems that many wait staff in many restaurants display an ignorance of the menu that really leaves the customer scratching their head."}
{"text":"We have frequented this restaurant several times and it's usually delicious and filling. Today was the opposite. We ordered two orders of a steak/chicken fajita combo. The skillets were \"lit\" on fire at the table.  The food was still cold including lukewarm refried beans.  There was hardly a full chicken breast between the two orders... think 5 pieces/bites of chicken and maybe 5 bites of steak. The veggies consisted of all onions with maybe 2-3 slices of pepper. All cold/lukewarm. Upon mentioning it to the waitress her response was \"ok what do you want me to do about it?\" I suggested getting a manager.   The manager's solution was to order extra meat and veggies AND BILL us for it (we found that part out later). After waiting to receive the extra for 10-15 minutes we told the manager to nevermind. The waitress later \"graciously\" pointed out how they took the \"extra\" charges off. Um how about the rest of the meal or a discount? Bad food. Bad service... luckily my husband found a meal replacement shake at a store nearby."}
{"text":"Stopped here on way home from work, haven't eaten here for a long time and my wife and I thought would be a good change. We were seated and the manager brought us out chips and salsa. I love hot sauce, I put it on every thing, and the bowls for the sauce were small . I asked if I could get a large bowl of hot sauce  and the manager said no. He explained that the chips and sauce was free and it wasn't meant to be the meal and i could just ask for more. Past experience has been once you receive your food you wont see them again for the check. I told him that we like it on our cheese crisp and food, he than charged me for a pint of take out sauce when dinning in its free and gave me a big bowl of sauce. Manager was very rude and treated us like crap will never be back. beware of this place manager is cheap and will nickel dime you if he can.    i"}
{"text":"Horrible, overpriced, reheated frozen crap. They should be embarrassed. 10 Page menu, plastic rice, terrible meals. I'll never go back. I work across the street from the complex and already have kept people away from here and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Five starts because my top plate in the world comes from this little New Mexico food restaurant. Ps:I have not been around the world. The Rio Grande Enchiladas with carne adobada are the best. The sauce is queso fundido spicy cheese sauce. It's sooooo yummy. During happy hour they have  $1 little margaritas, the house is good. Always feel so full after so don't like it as a date place.. more of a let's stuff my face place. Lunch special Monday through Friday, once of which are my enchiladas. ! Love it"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in town. The Rio Grande enchiladas are my most favorite meal ever, and easily my death row last meal request - if it ever comes to that."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because my lunch date wanted Mexican and it was by both our offices.  They had a $4.99 special of a chicken enchilada with a side of beans and rice.  What a smokin' deal, right?  Unfortunately, the enchilada was horrible.  It was tasteless, old and completely falling apart.  I picked at it and ended up with about 4 bites.  The chips and dip was the only bonus out of the entire meal.  I definitely got what I paid for. Never again."}
{"text":"A three is about right. I frequent this place quite often but the reality is the food is just ok. However the Queso Fundido is fantastic! You can go to this place and enjoy a solid dinner. If you go during happy hour the margaritas are decent for 99 cents. The happy hour appetizers are good as well. The meals are a bit overpriced for the quality. Known for using New Mexican Hatch chile, Arriba is a good spot for a meal."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Arriba's for many years. Their style of Mexican food is different from the rest of the restaurants. They claim to be New Mexico style. I am not sure exactly what that means since I have eaten a lot of Mexican food in Albuquerque and it is not like Arriba's. The real difference is Aribba's food is much hotter. They have several dishes with Hatch Chilies in it. This is what I come for. I love Hatch Chile. I used to bring suitcases full of Hatch Chile from Albuquerque, grill them and put them into the freezer.  Some times the chilies are a little hot other days it can be really hot.  Much of the time the chile is not that hot even though they will warn you when you order anything with Hatch in it. You can tell when the food enters the mouth just how hot it is going to be. Before the food touches your mouth you get that, this has the best flavor and it has not even hit your tongue yet.  Your next thought is this is going to be painfully hot. Water does not help. Four different times I have had Hatch that was almost to hot to eat. Take a bite, wait 10 min. before taking another. Unbelievably good. Unless you like it hot order something that does not have Hatch in it.  They serve corn chips with three sauces. Bean (This can be pretty hot at times), Salsa (This is usually pretty tame), then the hot sauce. It can be pretty hot but not near what the Hatch is.  They have daily lunch specials that are very reasonable. Every year they bring Hatch Chili in and roast them for you. Take them home put them in the freezer and when you fix you some soup put in a piece. Very Good.  My favorite dish is the Chicken Especial.  I am giving them 4 stars. The food deserves 5 stars the service at times is spotty. They seem to go through a lot of waiters and waitresses. Service is about a 2.5.  Give them a try! There are several of them around town. I have only been to the one at Arrowhead."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey but consistently good food. The breakfasts on Sunday morning are rather nice and they have a clown that offers balloon animals and face painting for the kiddos. Not the same old mexican food that you will get from other area restaurants, Arriba's serves more New Mexican fare than traditional tex-mex."}
{"text":"I ended up here with my family after the Ahwatukee Festival of Lights kickoff party.  We were headed into CKs, but their music was so loud we could hear it from the street.  I think there was a band there that night.  In any case, I'd promised my MIL she could have a drink, so we went to Arriba.  We weren't about to eat at Arriba, but it was 7 and my daughter hadn't eaten (it was past her 6:30 bedtime).  We ordered her a grilled cheese sandwich, which came with fries.  No big surprise, but it came out on white bread.  Standard restaurant grilled cheese; nothing special.  It was $4.99 without a drink, so it wasn't a great bargain.  No matter.  My daughter took three bites and was done with it.  My MIL and I both ordered margaritas.  They were quite large.  Mine was the House margarita and hers was the Gold.  The Gold was much stronger, but I didn't feel like paying $9.99 for a margarita.  Mine was only $6.    We also ordered a hatch chile cheese crisp.  I haven't been eating dairy, but it was the holidays so I gave myself a break.  The hatch chiles were of the EXTRA spicy variety.  They were so hot that I burned my tongue.  I had to order a side of sour cream to cut the heat.  It was barely edible... even for my tastes.  I LOVE spicy hatch chiles, but these were ridiculous (and actually hotter than Los Dos Molinos - a favorite of mine)!  MIL ordered a couple enchiladas.  She is from the Midwest and her tastes are a little blander than ours here in the Southwest.  She really enjoyed them because they were covered in melted nacho cheese.    Arriba's beer prices were good.  Their drink prices were RIDICULOUS ($11.99 for a mudslide, for example).    The server was extremely helpful in taking our order.  She was also very friendly.  I never really liked Arriba in the past, but this visit was just fine.  Overall, 3 stars because the food is nothing special and the drink prices are high."}
{"text":"Love the drinks, love the happy hour! 99 cent house margaritas could you go wrong with this? They also have large drinks you can share. The food is always awesome. Service could be better but it's not bad. We are frequent diners here."}
{"text":"Went here thinking we could get cheap yummy mexican. The only thing that was cheap was the quality of the food. Same prices as the other Mexican restaurants I like much better. Drive to Ajo Als,or El Encanto instead."}
{"text":"I went in for the first time when I heard they had .99 tacos, but the taco Tuesday special was two beef tacos with rice and beans for 4.99. They give you bean, salsa and chips as you wait which were both good. the waitresses was sweet and attentive and my food came out quickly. The beef was moist and flavorful but the iceberg lettuce and plain tomatoes on top were too wet so I could taste Arizona's lovely tap water in my taco. The price was nice but there was nothing special about my food."}
{"text":"Worst service ever....TWICE!  Food is fair at best!  We were so excited when this restaurant was being built...we couldn't wait to try it once it opened.  We gave it a few months after it opened to try it out.  We went with another couple and sat outside.  We sat outside forever it seemed.  No chips, no water ....no waiter/waitress.  Finally my husband went in to find someone and it was the hostess who finally brought waters and chips.  There were 2 other parties on the patio so it wasn't a matter of the patio being closed.  Our wait staff was just no where to be found.  UGH!  The hostess took our orders finally.  Let's just say....the food was fair at best and they never came back to see how it was or to give us the bill.  We again....finally just decided to get up and head for the door thinking maybe someone would help us.  NOPE....hostess, say's 'bye, thanks for coming\".  We were like....um, did you want us to pay???  No one has brought us our bill and we've been done with our food for over 15 minutes!  We asked for the manager and told her we wanted to pay our bill and that the service was TERRIBLE.  She didn't really care.  We paid our bill and left.  We all thought maybe this was a joke, \"funniest hidded videos\" since it was beyond bad service.  But....alas, it wasn't...it was just bad service.  Well, my husband and I went back a couple months later to try it ONE MORE TIME.  To keep this short and sweet, we actually had a waitress this visit...but, this time the service was bad due to the waitressbeing extremely rude.... in her own words, \"she's in a bad mood and having a bad day\".  We felt so lucky to get her....NOT! Oh yeah...trying to keep this short.  We wil NEVER step back into this restaurant again!!!"}
{"text":"Good food had the Grande enchiladas Really very good ! The waiter on point  Suprise came when u got the Bill ! 13.00 each shot tequila wtf  Told the mgr. He was a thief Never going back ...ever  Stay away and beware"}
{"text":"Food isn't the best.  I always feel like I ate a rock when I leave.  I do really like the salsa/chip tray they bring out (2 different salsas, a bean dip and chips).  You can get better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my fiance. Was greeted right away and sat very quickly. Our server Lance was attentive and energetic. He visited the table often and made sure we had everything we needed.  The food was fantastic I had the Poco Pollo chicken. It was well prepared and came out in a timely manner along with the chips and salsa.   We will absolutely return often because of the great food and great service provided by our server.  If you visit ask for Lance and you won't be disappointed by the food or the service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Place feels and looks like a dive.  It is too bad cause it is within walking distance from home.  The beer is way too warm.  Wanted to try the food but if they can't bottled beer cold, I can't imagine the food to be any good. Staff morale seems to be in the dumpster.  Somebody definitely is not doing their job."}
