{"text":"Best wedding soup in Pittsburgh!! Great salads - dressing - and the tiramisu and cannoli are heavenly!!'  You won't be disappointed!'"}
{"text":"Everything here is wonderful... my husband and I have eaten our way through the menu.... tried multiple arancini, salads, rolls (pepperoni - yum!), and we tried the Sicilian pizza tonight.  Hands down best Sicilian pizza I've had in Pittsburgh.  The arancini is delicious - we never go without ordering an Al Burro. The service is great and everyone who works there is so friendly! Also - Thursday and Friday are open late... we love to take a bottle of wine (BYOB!) on Friday and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Truly delicious.  Everything is completely homemade.  And authentic.  I had the arancini with the bolognese filling and it was melt in your mouth good and the sauce inside was perfection.  I almost wish they would start jarring and selling their sauce!  I also had a side salad with a fantastic vinaigrette.  Not pricey in the least and you get a great meal.  It is definitely a little hidden as you walk down a flight of stairs off the street level, but inside it's quite cozy and welcoming.  My guess is they will grow quickly and maybe eventually move to a street level storefront some day.  Viva arancini house!"}
{"text":"Very nice and authentic! My wife and I both had the \"original\" arancini filled with bolognese and we both really liked it and plan to return."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch today. The food was fabulous and it is a cute cozy restaurant. It was a welcome retreat on a cold windy day. They were so kind to make one for my husband that was gf. Beware they share the same fryer so it wouldn't be okay for a celiac. Worked for us! Will be back."}
{"text":"We are visiting our son from out of town. He said he thought he had found a great Sicilian restaurant to try. He was correct!   He had been looking for a restaurant that made a wonderful fried chickpea sandwiches he enjoyed while serving a mission in Livorno, Italy. When he saw that Arancini House serves authentic Sicilian food, he looked at their website and saw THE sandwich! (Panelle)  We loved the place as soon as we walked down the stairs and were met by amazing smells and very friendly people.   Since we hadn't been to Arancini House before, the lovely person behind the counter gave us a great description of their traditional foods and their origins.  We ordered The Original and Al Burro arancini, panelle sandwiches, pepperoni rolls, meatball rolls and wedding soup. Everything was delicious. The food was hot, fresh and ample in portions. We just loved how welcomed we felt. This is our new favorite place! We just wish they had a franchise in Washington State!"}
{"text":"This is fantastic! I have had Italian rice balls here and there, maybe at a wedding, but these are something else!  I guess the real name is Arancini. We had the Banana Pepper and an Al Burro. The AB is utterly fabulous. The rice melts in your mouth.  It is nicely set up. Really, really nice staff and owners.   It is in a downstairs of a building, so it takes a minute to find, but was easy. They have a camera outside so you can watch the street traffic while you eat.  It made my weekend."}
{"text":"Wow!! I have been thinking about trying this place for a while now and finally did. My fianc√© and I got our meal for take out and were blown away! We had the 3 different types of Arancini: the original, banana pepper and beans & greens. All were amazing! We also ordered a Prosciutto & Caprese Sandwich and Meatball Roll..both were unreal! We will definitely be back very regularly!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Delicious made from scratch food and amazing service. The owners truly care about their customers and it shows. I can not say enough good things about Arancini House. Their soups are probably my favorite but the pizza is a close second. Everything is great so it's hard to choose. Some have said it's hard to find, but they now have a sign on the street level and a neon sign by the door so you can't miss it. It's so nice to go to a place that is inviting. The fish sandwich during Lent is fantastic too. Everything on the menu is great. This little gem is a must try."}
{"text":"GREAT authentic food ! You must stop in. It's a little hard to find, as it's in the basement of an apt building. With that being said it's directly across the street from Rollier's. Stop in and have a ball no really try their balls ! They are simply amazing ! Everything was Great! Including our service."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious and the people here are so nice! I really felt like I was eating a good home cooked meal made with love.   Arancinis are hard to come by in Pittsburgh, and can be found in areas with larger Sicilian populations like NY and Boston. Being a Bostonian who's lived next to the North End (Boston's Little Italy) most of my life, I have high standards when it comes to Italian food. The Arancini House is the real deal! This is place for some good Italian comfort food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Perfect niche of a walk in order at counter street food that is typically not found elsewhere.  Great BYOB spot.  Friendly service.  Can be as quick or relaxed as you want.  Definitely a high value at a low rpice"}
{"text":"I feel like I've been let in on a amazing secret. Arancini House in Mt. Lebanon is one of those places that I have left feeling truly excited about finding a gem of a place to get authentic amazing Sicilian food. We happened upon the small shop and were greeted by the most pleasant people.   We shared three different Arancini, two kinds of their rolls (think mini calzone) and a slice of pizza. Each thing was better than the last. Pizza is the best mix of a crust that both has a crunch and chew to it. Amazing sauce and cheese ratio and it doesn't help that it was hot and incredibly delicious. The Arancini are the best I've had at a restaurant hands down!   Please go, give it a try and bring your friends!! They do not disappoint."}
{"text":"Not only is the food pretty darn delicious (and affordable) but the owners and workers are so friendly and awesome! Arancini House serves up Italian fried rice balls among other Italian items like pizza and rolls. You might have a hard time finding it because it's in the basement of a building. However, just look out for the signs and arrows.   Came here on a Friday night with the hubby and the small dining room was completely filled except one table. Perfect for us! The space is super casual and you order and pay at the counter. We ordered the Sicilian pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms and of course we couldn't come here without trying arancini (rice balls), which we got the stuffed hot pepper. One bite of the arancini and you are in heaven! Crispy outer shell, but the rice is so soft and moist and the flavors of the filling are absolutely perfect. Next time, I will get several and not just one! The pizza was also great; crispy outer crust yet soft and thick. Pizza wasn't too greasy. My one and only gripe is the mushrooms seemed like they were canned. What I loved most about this visit was the \"secret\" Calabrian pepper infused honey the owner brought out to us. This item is not on the menu but trust me, you're going to want to ask about it! The owners were inspired by Mike's Hot Honey so they made their own with Calabrian hot peppers. The honey is mildly spicy yet still very sweet and it's perfect on the pizza!!   I just wish they had late hours everyday. They are only open late (until 9 pm) on Thursdays and Fridays. Any other day, they're open until 5 pm except they're closed on Sundays and Mondays. Otherwise, I love this place and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Sicilian pizza around!   My husband and I have been on a search for good sicilian pizza for some time, and a friend suggested we check out Arancini House.   We stopped in on a Thursday evening and aside from another couple we had the dining room to ourselves. The place was clean, and one of the owners waited on us. He took his time and explained the menu to us, and told us all about Arancini (which apparently means \"orange\" in Italian).   Since we had been looking for pizza we decided to skip the arancini this time and order a Sicilian with pepperoni and mushroom. Unlike a previous reviewer mentioned, I noticed that the mushrooms were definitely FRESH, and not from a can or jar. Canned mushrooms are one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to pizza, so I noticed right away that these were fresh! I was pretty happy about that! (I posted a picture as well)  The crust was well done too - cooked all the way through and crisp on the bottom and outside. The amount of toppings, sauce and cheese were perfect as well. Overall we were VERY happy with this pizza.   I also had a bowl of wedding soup which I was less excited about. It did not taste homemade or like anything special. Don't get me wrong, it was good... But it was just typical \"restaurant\" wedding soup.   The owner checked on us and cleared our table even though this isn't really a \"sit-down\" type place and he was working alone. He also told us about how they got the business started and his father-in-law's (who is co-owner and chef) cooking experience in Sicily. I appreciated him taking the extra time to chat and tell us about the food and culture.   The only down side is the hours (mostly early afternoons and closed on Sunday and Monday). I feel like this place would be CRAZY popular somewhere like Lawrenceville, or as a food truck.  Overall it was a really great experience and we can't wait to go back to try all the different arancini."}
{"text":"We went for our first visit today and it was amazing. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. I had the AlBurro and my husband had the banana pepper arancini and they were wonderful. But the highlight was the prosciutto caprese sandwich. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The bread is amazing. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I grew up in Brooklyn NY and I've been looking for New York style pizza and riceballs in Pittsburgh ....... I found it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the tastiest spots to visit in the South Hills. You'll find Arancini House within Mt. Lebanon's business district. You just have to keep your eyes peeled for their door and walk down stairs to their lower level location (I believe the elevators in the building can also get you there).  Arancini House is cozy and unassuming, but don't be fooled by their humble set-up. Behind the counter are some of the friendliest staffers I've ever spoken to. They love answering questions and chatting with their customers. And they make fantastic, freshly baked food!  They offer a nice selection of arancini, including a weekly rotation of veggie options. I'm especially fond of the Al Burro (Bechamel cream sauce, prosciutto di cotto, peas). Also available for diners are wedding soup, a couple salads and fried appetizers, sandwiches, and homemade dessert. And of course, their generous helpings of pizza!   I highly recommend stopping in here and exploring the menu at your own pace. At least one arancini is a must, of course. Just be ready to come back for more - in my experience these tasty treats are filling and satisfying!"}
{"text":"Awesome owner! Food was quite good. We had the original and beans green arancinis as well as meatball and sausage & peppers rolls. My fave was the meatball roll. Good Lord, I could've wept!! So so good! The arancinis were quite good too. He was out of a lot of stuff because they got slammed last night. Looking forward to going back and trying more stuff on the menu, like the Panelles and the awesome desserts!"}
{"text":"Authentic. Great flavor. Makes you wish to have seconds. Save space for the cannoli. Kids love it. Coffee is Lavazza."}
{"text":"My sister recently returned from Sicily and told me about the wonderful arancini she ate on a daily basis. Less than a week later I heard about this little gem. A friend and I split three balls -- the red with ragu, white with bechamel and the weekly special -- greens and beans. It was tough picking a favorite because they were all wonderful. I look forward to returning and trying the panelle, the rolls and the pizza. My friend actually returned the same night for dinner. It's that good. Great place with a wonderful owner."}
{"text":"Find it! Easier said than done since it's in the basement of the building. Amazing arancini in several varieties - fresh, warm and crispy. We also managed to try the 'Torta della Nonna' which they fly in monthly from Naples, Italy (made by grandmas in Naples). I loved that the placed was very specialized and clearly knew how to extract flavor and texture from what is a pretty simple idea."}
{"text":"It was our first time there. The woman behind the counter was very friendly. She explained all the choices. We had the arancini. It was very good. It is meat, peas and sauce wrapped in rice breaded and fried. We will go back again some day."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Lebo - if you have not tried Arancini House yet, go ASAP! We have eaten dinner here three or four times so far, and are impressed and happy each time. The balls are amazing (note that I am vegetarian so I've never had a meat one, but they always have a different delicious veggie option). BYOB, kid friendly, quaint and clean atmosphere. The owners are very nice and helpful. Great salad, pizza, sauce everything."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I loved the original aranchini! I studied abroad in Sicily and when I tried their aranichini it brought me back to living in Sicily!   The archini house had four varieties to pick from including a vegetarian option. The aranichini is a nice size and reasonably price ($4.50). The staff and owner were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean! I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in trying something new! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Thanks, Yelp, for a wise referral to this small but powerful Italian yum fest. Arancini - fried risotto balls - lived up to the expectations. Our son downed the meatball cibo de strada and mozzarella sticks. Delish!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the arancini. Flavorless rice and cheese The one thing I did like was the marinara which I requested    Still searching for an authentic arancini in Pittsburgh area..."}
{"text":"Maybe the best sandwich bun in Pittsburgh. I thought to ask it they sold the rolls by the dozen- unbelievable good.  The panelle sandwich was just like in Sicily. Same for the arancini.   Affordable and great for lunch!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's better the arancini (all varieties are good, the original is my fave), the Italian salad dressing (planning to buy a pint next time), or the people who work there (friendly, kind, talented)! Great place! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Excellent food, and treat you like family.  The Sicilian balls are amazing and the specials even better.  Also the pizza is NY style and superb."}
{"text":"We were surprised we hadn't heard of this place until recently. You can easily miss it if you aren't looking for it, but definitely stop in! Casual spot with awesome food. A group of us split a Sicilian pizza (takes 30 minutes to make so I recommend calling it in before you arrive), banana pepper Arancini, and a pepperoni roll. Everything was amazing! Pepperoni roll had a good amount of pepperoni in it, unlike most places, and the Arancini was so delicious! Like could not stop eating, even though I was painfully full, delicious. Prices are reasonable, especially when you realize how filling everything is.  Everyone working was very friendly. You can feel the happy vibe right when you walk in. Go here!"}
{"text":"They have Saturday hours!!  Had read about this place a couple of times and really wanted to try it, but their hours just didn't work for me.  So, I was psyched to see their hours had changed (thanks, yelp)!    Stopped by around 11:30 on a Saturday.  Joe, who I assumed was one of the owners, was super-friendly.  He explained their options and told us about some of their plans.    It's a cute little space on the terrace level (read: basement) near across from the Saloon and up the block on Washington from La Pomponee (etc).  Lots of seating.  Had the broccolini arancini (fried risotto ball), eggplant parm roll and a san pellegrino.  The texture of the arancini was quite nice.  Soft on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside.  The roll had a nice mix of ingredients to give it flavor without being soggy.  It came with a side of sauce.  I thought the sauce was quite good - definitely made the roll.  DH had a sausage and pepper roll and a slice of pizza.  He found the pizza (a new addition to the menu) to be a tad greasy (they use whole milk moz), but solved that with a napkin.  Our total was just over $20 - so comparable to what we'd spend at a take out place (Chipotle, etc).  All in all, a really great addition to the neighborhood!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is located below ground, the choices are few. It's not bad as a quick bite but it's not an destination place imho.  The music is is way too loud. Improvements could be made. It has potential."}
{"text":"I had passed by this place so many times with the desire to go down those stairs and try it, but never got around to doing it. Luckily I had an hour in my parking spot left and decided to give it a go. I am of Sicilian heritage and have never even heard of arancini. Basically a fried risotto ball stuffed with some seriously delicious stuff. I was very grateful that they were serving vegetarian versions because it seemed like a traditionally meat filled ball.   The two working when I went in were so incredibly friendly and helpful. I was walked through every dish they had and everything was explained. They even explained how their pizza had both a crunch and a chew (they were correct about that by the way). I couldn't decide between the arancini and pizza so I decided to be gluttonous and get both!   The first thing I noticed was how rich it was but also that neither item was overly salty. Having a slice of pizza that is not covered in salt made me realize that most every other slice of pizza I have had in my life was over-salted. Incredible, fresh tasting ingredients went into both dishes. You have a great view of everything happening in the kitchen, which was immaculate. I was very impressed and will wbe returning."}
{"text":"We read about Arancini House and had to go and check it out!  The restaurant is a little hard to find as it is downstairs off Washington Road but is well worth the hunt!  The restaurant is clean and cozy and the owner Joe is super friendly and helpful.  He explained how the arancini takes 24 hours to create and the final product is delicious!  We tried just about one of everything and our whole party loved every item we ordered.  I am so glad to have found this gem and will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Found Arancini House when I was searching for a bite to eat for lunch in Mt Lebanon. Joe helped me decide on a Caprese arancini and cup of wedding soup. Both were great tasting, and hearty portions that left me full. Highly recommended, and this won't be my last visit!"}
{"text":"Have a hankering for something warm and delicious for lunch?  Arancini House is absolutely worth a visit!  I didn't know what these mysterious balls were.  We asked the co-owner and he explained to us that he owns the restaurant with his father in law (I believe) and the recipes are all traditional Sicilian recipes that his family has been making for years.  The arancini balls were great but what was even better was the vegetarian eggplant roll we had!  Imagine a non-flaky and semi-doughy croissant.  Now imagine it stuffed with eggplant parmesan.  Yum!  Thank you, Arancini House, for having me leave your shop with a very happy belly and a little marinara sauce on my skirt.    Just a tip: this isn't visible from the street, but rather you need to walk into what looks like a professional building and stroll down a flight of stairs.  You'll be so glad you did!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a hidden gem on Washington Road. Located in the basement, the storefront is modest, but the food is anything but. Everything is homemade and delicious! It's always a treat to meet friends here for lunch."}
{"text":"What a great find. We had been wanting to try this place since reading about it last summer, and it did not disappoint. We tried the Al Burro, a slice of plain pizza, a sausage and peppers roll, a pepperoni roll (which was a great, delicious twist on my home state's official food), wedding soup, wedge salad and tiramisu. All of it was delicious, but the arancini is what is the star of the show here. But what REALLY stands out at Arancini House are the people and the customer service. The owner is so friendly and personable and took the time to explain arancini to us and what each item was. Combine that with fresh, delicious food and reasonable prices and we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fine pizza at the cute neighborhood friendly restaurant. Also try the Caprese Sandwich with egg. So good!"}
{"text":"Totally unique place with phenomenal food. Had an arancini stuffed with broccoli and cheese. Wow! Everything else looked fresh and made with love. I wish the owner much success. He deserves it!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent ! I ordered the arancini and a Sicilian Pizza. The original arancini was delicious. The sauce and cheese were of great quality and taste. I also ordered the AL Burro arancini, which was even better than the original. The proccuito was cubed, not thinly sliced which gave a good punch of flavor. The cream sauce in the AL Burro was perfect. I have no complaints about the pizza. It took about thirty minutes since the dough is fresh. It is worth the wait. I was extremely happy and impressed with everything I ordered and will be returning."}
{"text":"Had really high expectations for Arancini House from yelp reviews but was surprisingly under impressed. Stopped for lunch on a Saturday afternoon with my husband. The lighting was very bright and the atmosphere more like a drug store than restaurant. We ordered three different rice balls, the third which was completely cold inside and had to be re-heated. Disappointing experience."}
{"text":"What a great new place in the area!  It is a little bit hidden but it is well worth it to find it! I only had one arancini so far but I need to go back and try more. I had their original one it was fantastic."}
{"text":"So so delicious, fast, friendliest service ever, family owned business, just an overall awesome experience! My 4 year old daughter who's quite a picky eater loved the Arancinis too! We will be back."}
{"text":"Seriously the best food in the South Hills.  The original ball - so warm & delicious.  It is the ultimate comfort food.  My boyfriend loves the banana pepper ball the most.  I'm not a big Sicilian pizza person, but I love this one.  Great sauce and dough.  The eggplant parm pocket is so good, The bread, the filling is just perfect.  We have tried almost everything on the menu - and everything they make is fresh and fantastic.  Owner is awesome too.  I wish them great success!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem.  The staff is so friendly and if you have a question be sure to ask.  Stopped in recently to get an arancini because it had been to long and we were looking for some Cibo Di Strada.  We picked up a couple of different arancini which are a great snack or meal and a pizza."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood to try authentic Sicilian food at an affordable price in an adorable atmosphere with the friendliest, extremely talented owners- look no further! This is not your lit up store front that you pass on the street, look in and decide to try it; instead, you read the sidewalk sign and proceed to the left where you follow two flights of stairs down and to the right. This place defines \"hidden gem\" in every sense of the term. The ambiance is bright, fun and intimate. It is very welcoming and the owners add to that. My mom and I were walking in Mount Lebanon looking for a place to eat when I stopped to read the sign for Arancini House. Being that I'm on a restrictive diet, I was going to turn away when two patrons heard my mom and I talking and told us we have got to try their amazing food. They even went on to say that the owners would try to make me something that fit my Paleo diet. We followed their advice and couldn't be happier. Joe (owner along with Manny) was so bright and passionate about his food and business that you couldn't help but get excited about it too. I ordered the chickpea fritters (flour and chickpea). Joe was so enthused about this dish that he wanted me to try it before I even thought of buying it! What great customer service! I ended up buying two orders! They have such a phenomenal taste that I can barely describe it: a beautiful lemony taste paired with baked chickpea and a fried crust. You really need to try it and then do a better job than I could in describing it. It is phenomenal. I ordered the two of the house salad with chopped romaine and spring mix, roasted red peppers, olives, artichokes, cherry tomatoes, and a homemade red wine vinaigrette. I told the owner all about my diet and he decided to make me a new salad complete with  protein (tuna). My mom ordered the meatball roll and really enjoyed it! She was also impressed with the chickpea fritters, I was so absolutely thrilled with the service and dining experience at Arancini House that I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and anyone!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and it's definitely going to become a ritual. It's right next to my pediatrician's office so it's easy to grab lunch there before going home. Both times we had no problem getting a table and there are high chairs. Awesome!  The food is fantastic!!! Authentic Sicilian! I had some questions about the arancini and compared them to a dish I had in Rome. They were able to explain the difference and the meaning of each of the words in Italian. It was fascinating!    My latest time there I had an classic arancini ball. It's a fried risotto ball with bolognese meat sauce and peas inside. The perfect size - the size of an orange - and was a filling meal when I added a cup of wedding soup. My son got a piece of plain pizza and devoured it. I had one bite and knew why! SO GOOD.   The set up is simple, order at the counter, grab a drink from the cooler. Easy and quick. The decor is so cute with lots of orange accents, which made a lot more sense when I found out the arancini means little oranges!   I highly recommend this for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I've walked past this place countless times and never knew it was there.  My wife came across it somehow and we made a trip up for lunch to check it out.  We had the bolognese arancini and sicilian pizza and both were really good.  I swear I could eat a dozen of the arancini balls.  The place was clean (albeit well hidden!) and the staff friendly and informative.  We'll be stopping in for lunch again soon."}
{"text":"Arancini House is delicious! The food is fresh and the atmosphere is inviting and familial. Grab a few items and share. Save room for a fresh, homemade cannoli!"}
{"text":"Menu is not extensive but the food is really well prepared for what they offer. The actual Arancini is incredible."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it will now be added to my Mt Lebanon area go to place for breakfast or lunch.  My friend and I loved the broccoli risotto balls, and the T-shirt!  In fact I would go there just for that item.  Oops..and the donut cannoli dessert."}
{"text":"Not only is the food fresh, perfectly cooked and delicious, the service was some of the nicer in the area. They made us feel we were eating at a friends house. Looking forward to going back and trying more menu items"}
{"text":"I visited Arancini House today as I LOVE arancini.  This place did not disappoint! The arancini I had as well as the meatball roll were delicious. And don't even get me started on the Donnoli.  The staff was very informative and enagaging.  I am in the process of relocating to Pittsburgh and can't wait to stop in again!"}
{"text":"A treasure of delicious food and a warm welcoming atmosphere. We were a large party and they went out of their way to see we were comfortable and our appetites satisfied. The food was delicious. I could just imagine my grandparents eating an Arancini in Vicari, Sicily. The atmosphere is casual and warm. Go as you are and be sure you're hungry. I had Arancini, a slice of pizza and the house salad. To top it off a wonderful cannoli and a bite of my daughters tiramisu. Yum. We will go again and soon."}
{"text":"An authentic slice of NY in Mt. Lebanon  I had a slice of cheese pizza, and it was delicious! The crust was perfect and chewy. Also, the owner Joe is incredibly friendly - makes you really want to support the business.   As a note, the restaurant is downstairs."}
