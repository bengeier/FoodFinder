{"text":"Went out with a group of friends for dinner, drinks and dancing.   We ordered appetizers and pizza's as mains. The food was not so impressive.   The service was reasonable.  Went over to the lounge area. Bartenders were great and accommodating.   The dancing began a while later. DJ was not working the crowd & felt like he was playing for himself. At one point there were more people outside than inside dancing.   We will be back for drinks and dancing, but we'll be going elsewhere for dinner before."}
{"text":"Food: B+ Service: C+ Food presentation: B+ Atmosphere: B+ Prices: B Recommended?: Yes  I've been here on numerous occasions and I was here for a birthday a couple of years ago and they were great with accommodating a larger group (20+ people). Some of the dishes were pretty good but I found mine a bit too salty. Bottom line, this place isn't bad, if you don't mind the inattentive waitstaff. Spacco either doesn't have enough waiters or that the management has difficulty managing the volume and this could get annoying at times."}
{"text":"Spacco restaurants is a great place to eat and have party's. The food is amazing great cooks in the kitchen. Waitress are very nice and know what's good. The patio is very nice , cute place . It's on a very good street and there open for lunch every Thursday, Friday and Saturday . I would definitely recommend coming her four lunch or Dinner it's amazing."}
{"text":"$7.50 for a glass of Diet Coke. What a bargain! Everything was going great until that happened. I immediately gave the Diet Coke back to the bartender-- what a joke."}
{"text":"All in all, a really good place I believe to meet, and just get together with friends in a open, clean area. If you want a more formal dinner experience and flow expected in a North American eatery it might be not be the best choice, unless you really don't mind parking yourself and just 'chilling' out without expectation of timed service. Actually, the pace of service kind of felt like I was at a restaurant/bar in the Carribean.     I live in the area at Yonge n Eglinton but hadn't been inclined to venture into Spacco since it is in the back of a 'Alley' behind Alleycatz.  Now my review is likely more positive since I live in the area, so I wasn't in that rushed more formal mood..  more of a 'oh, let's take a walk there'.    I had a couple of those groupons so the four of us went the first time. And another occasion with just the wife the second.      First time, we sat in the pool hall side.  Nice open area, decor is updated and modern. It kind of has that Milestones feel.  Especially compared to other bars and pubs in the area, which is generally more smaller and has that older feel, this was a pleasant surprise.    Some of the items on the menu may seem bit overpriced, but really, it's largely inline with the neighbourhood.  Servings  are actually pretty good size, so you can even order one dish and split it with two people. The appetizers are smaller, but good in the sense that it won't fill you up (this could also be seen as 'underwhelming' in size relative to size  when compared to some other places).     I've had the Calzone, one of the pastas and pizza.  All were pretty good and I would recommend it.  Pastas are said to be home made, which did seem like it.  Pizzas have a real thin crust, so it's nicely toasted.   I did not get to sit on the patio, but that is also seems like a hidden gem. Again, especially when comparing to patio space in the area which is smaller.. except for the Boston Pizza back patio.  We played some pool which was fun like the ol days.    Ok, so the thing that can be improved is the overall service aspect.  This was also mentioned by another reviewer. Now, we did get friendly service.  First time, it was one of the partners (a bit of a bruiser guy) but turned out to be a really good guy, service. Second time I went with my wife, the waiter was also nice. However, you didn't get that attention right away so it kind disrupts the flow of the experience a bit I found.   HOWEVER, on both occasions, we were chatting it up and taking it easy so not feeling rushed was actually welcome.        it doesn't have that formal feel run as a restaurant/bar. The service seemed to lack that hustle and attentiveness expected in normal restaurants/bar. And even dress code (hard to identify who is a waiter/waitress exactly as the waiter was in normal street clothes).  It kind of has that 'Ma and Pa' feel but run by Dudes.  Maybe it's different on a weekend as I was there on a Sunday night, and tuesday.   I am told it does somewhat turn clubbish with dancing on weekends. I am actually considering on having a gathering there for my bday, more to chill, drink, and have snacks/food for people who want that.  So if you're in the area, or need a central place (Yonge n Eglinton) to meet up with a larger group, make sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"I can only imagine that this place is gross midtown club on the weekend.  During the week they serve 8 dollar pints and 7 dollar bottles along with mediocre food.    Toronto bars have grown up...well at least all the others.  Yuk.  They have a beautiful wood fire pizza oven as well and into it they put sub-par tomatoes and Cracker Barrel cheese."}
{"text":"My sister brought me here with a Groupon she bought. I ordered the mussels, mushroom ravioli, and tiramisu as well as some alcoholic coffee cocktails. The mussels had a funky taste to them and the sauce they were in was bland. The ravioli was decent, but the marinara it was covered in might as well have been Ragu. The tiramisu again was edible but didn't really have the taste of texture of tiramisu. The coffee cocktail was sweet and overpriced. The decor was confusing, there was a big screen TV with the game on in the dining area and it made the atmosphere somewhere in between a fancy restaurant and a sports bar... In any case it was loud and uncomfortable. Also I was in a small group but gratuity was added to the bill by the server, which I found odd. I'm giving it two stars because our server otherwise was incredibly nice and attentive, and the food was edible."}
{"text":"A friend had made reservations for 9:15 on a Saturday night for a party of 15. We arrived on time and were waiting over 45 minutes because a party from an earlier reservation was still using the tables.   Next, we were told separate bills weren't an option for large parties. I don't know how the owner expects a large party to pool their money together, especially since most people don't carry cash anymore. Not everyone will order the same value of food and drink, so an even split is also impractical.   The waiter gave us the full bill and then offered to split the bill any way we wanted. I carefully put numbers beside each order to indicate which items were part of which bill. The waiter literally screwed up every bill. I wasted nearly 30 minutes trying to sort it all out. I wish I could have spent this time with my friends since we came to celebrate.   The restaurant needs to reconsider their policy about large parties. It's not practical at all to except a large group of people to pay on one bill.   The food isn't worth the service. Eat somewhere else, but stop by later for drinks because it has a decent nightlife."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for 8 years and I thought I should give this place a 3 Rd chance!! I will never comeback here again. Slow service horrible food and when you get the bread instead of olive oil you get a cheap Golden Griddle style nasty butter!!! This place sucks!!"}
{"text":"I ordered vegetarian pizza, and the food was very delicous. The crust is thin and flavorful, ingredients are fresh and tasty as well. that 1 star is for the food. Many people praise their patio in the reviews. However, I see nothing special. Just a regular patio in the yard instead of by the street.  The main reason that I will never return is the service - It sucked ass.  The person who handed us the menus threw them on the table and just walked away without any sort of greeting or offering of drinks. Umm...hello?  Our waitress took her time. We were all left sitting there with nothing to drink and nothing to do.  After bringing our food, she never came back to check on us ever again. At the time of paying, we were told by the same waitress that they do not do separate bills. (Oh really? Is that because it's extra work for you?) Certainly did not expect that, and having a group of 10 people, we had to search for all the cash we could find and divide the bills ourselves. It took 20 minutes JUST PAYING OUR BILL.  If you're going to charge me 20 dollars for pasta, you'd better make sure you deliver more than great food."}
{"text":"***UPDATE****  This restaurant is so scummy, that the owners wrote a five star review of the restaurant on Yelp and tried to pass it off as a customer. The review has since been flagged and removed  ********************   I had quite possibly the worst experience of my life at this place.  We tried to host an engagement party at Spacco. We called in advance to ask they set aside an area for 30-40 of our friends. When we arrived, they told us no area was set aside, and one of the bartenders started laughing at us mocking us that we wanted an area set aside at a bar. Eventually they set aside four chairs and one table for our friends and told us to have our friends congregate around and leave their jackets on the the chairs at the table.  One hour later the waitress for the table came up to my fiancee and called her a f**** bitch for using the table as a coat area. My fiancee responded by telling her this is what the staff had told us to do, and by this point it would be impossible to go find each person individually and have them move their coat.  The owner then came up and placed his hands on her back and started yelling at my fiancee. The owner told off my fiancee for this coat problem. My fiancee ignored him because he was being so rude. The owner then yelled at her to leave. I came up and tried to explain to the owner that this whole situation was his own staffs fault. The owner proceeded to just scream and yell at us, so we had all our friends simply walk out of the bar.  The owner is an abusive, arrogant, prick on a power trip because he owns a bar, and his entire staff treat their customers with no respect.  Do not go here."}
{"text":"Used to go to Spacco on a regular frequency. Salad with grilled steak was excellent. Bought a dealfind coupon to bring us back for a special night with my wife. Wishing we never went. Our old memories were better than it has become. Shrimp appetizer excellent. Mussels cracked shells and broken shells meant that the mussels were dead, one or two could slip by, I stopped counting at six and sent it back. No apology, no offering a replacement, or something else. I had to ask for drink refills, but they didn't bother to ask my wife, rude. Didn't ask for it but the waiter said he would bring bread for the mussels, it never showed up. Good pizza, but the rissotto was swimming in butter, quarter inch deep at the bottom of the bowl. Get the bill, don't worry sir, we've taken care of the mussels.  However, they still thought it approprate to add a 15% tip. First time that I have left a restaurant without paying the full bill. Extremelly disappointing considering that it used to be so good.  I guess the sign that it was only half full on a Friday night is the tell all. Been in business since 1993, won't see their twenty year anniversary unless serious change happens. Toronto is a big city wiith lots of great restaurants. Don't waste your time with this one."}
{"text":"Been here twice for company event and both occasion had been very enjoyable.  Staffs were friendly and accommodating .   Place is fairly clean and lots of pool tables but may disappoint snooker players since they don't have snooker tables.  Their catering wasn't too bad so I can imagine their food to be on par with most bar restaurants.  All in all, if you're looking for some mingling and a little entertainment on the side, Spacco will probably fit those criteria for most bar goers."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Their new lunch menu provides a wide array of selections daily for only $10, and the quantity/quality of food is very pleasing.  I had the Veggie Wrap with house salad, which was made with soft pizza dough, filled with marinated vegetables, tons of goat cheese, and the salad was very fresh with colored greens and balsamic.  The atmosphere is very comfortable and they have a gorgeous, spacious patio.  For the price I felt it was a great value and would absolutely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came here at 10pm on a Saturday. Food was good! My friend had the seafood pasta. The waitstaff was quick and attentive.  Bar was good as well. Really like the pool tables!  The vibe from the crowd is very relaxed and down-to-earth. Good music."}
{"text":"Despite seeing the downward trend in recent reviews, I decided to stop into this place for the first time on Friday night. Big mistake.   Honestly, I don't get it. You have a bar with modern pool tables, a decent vibe and a good selection of beer. How do you mess that up? Terrible service caused by rude and unapologetic staff   After sitting down with my girlfriend at an unoccupied table, I was approached by a waitress who, in the most rude manner possible, informed us that we would have to move because the table was reserved. I was unsure as to how I was supposed to know this given that there were no signs indicating that I was not to sit down. After getting up, I asked her if she could get us a drink. She turned her back and walked away. I started to get upset but my girlfriend told me to forget about it so we walked over to the bar.   We approached the bar (which was empty) and proceeded to stand there for two or three minutes while the bartenders and servers walked around in the back aimlessly, casually making small talk while ignoring their customers. Finally, a bartender came over and we got our two pints of beer. Thinking that the night was about to pick up, we walked over to one of the other tables and began to drink.  Within 10 minutes, a fight broke out nearby. Not surprisingly, the bouncers rushed over to break it up. At this point, I tried to grab my girlfriend and move her out of the way. Unfortunately, I was too slow to react and she was nailed by one of the bouncers and went down hard. I picked her up off the ground and expected an apology. The bouncer carried on like nothing had happened and never came back to say a word to her once he had thrown a couple of people out. I asked to speak to the manager but I was told he was unavailable. At this point, I was quite angry but my girlfriend did not want to create a scene so we simply grabbed our drinks and left. What a nightmare. Stay away. There are many other options nearby that do not treat their customers this terribly."}
{"text":"Mitch is right, this place does have one of the better patios in the Yonge-Eglionton area, at least that I've seen (remind me to compile a list sometime before May).  Other than that, this place is just A-OK in my books.  The crowd seems a bit thugly for my liking, but my friends like the food here and don't seem to mind the patrons quite as much as I do.  In fairness, the food is quite good, though pricey considering you're eating in a pool hall, and service is hit-and-miss.  Had a grilled calamari app on Friday that came out with some sort of chipotle sauce.  Delicious, and perfectly-cooked - very tender.  My gnocchi were mediocre, but the mushroom cream sauce was quite good and I used my little dumplings to sop up every bit of sauce that I could.  If you're going in for dinner, take heed:  It's really loud in there.  Don't expect to be able to have a conversation over dinner.  If you're going in to play pool, take heed:  The tables aren't very good, and some of them aren't even level.  If you're going in to hang out with a bunch of your friends and look cool, thogh, you'll fit right in."}
{"text":"i went to spacco with a large group of my friends after having a reservation made and confirmed. They denied us entrance into the restaurant and stated we could not come because we were underage. two people after us entered the restaurant after us and were seated. i am very angry."}
{"text":"Partner and I went here on a Groupon that was gifted to us a while ago. Don't remember what either of us got but I remember leaving the place feeling crestfallen and too far uptown for my liking.  Our time here was marked indelibly by the fact that we were there on a Groupon - like they were discounting our experience of the place because we were getting a discount. Although I understand that the point of this service is to get people to come and discover your restaurant - I feel like it should be in a business's best interest to captivate their diners so that they wish to return at regular price. This place didn't seem to do that, like the whole Groupon thing was a way to drum up some temporary business in a winter lull when their patio is out of service. This is evidenced by the skimpy experience they provided us and, what I assume, to be other diners there on a voucher. The place is massive - outfitted with a small dining room and a much bigger, cozier-looking space. The \"grouponers\" were seated in close quarters in the small dining room, near the drafty-ass door and given the same cookie-cutter experience. Even the desert was pre-made and sat in the freezer so that it was difficult to cut and stuck to the plate. The waiter was so casual as to short us on our change for the tip - I don't remember how much, probably a negligible amount, but it felt presumptuous.   My only advice to this business is to strive to maintain a level of excellence across all strata of patrons, it may foster enough goodwill for them to return. Having felt thoroughly second-class I will not return, discount or otherwise."}
{"text":"I decided to give Spacco a shot on a Groupon and I'm very disappointed. The ambiance was bad, tables were wobbly and the food was bland - but passable. The server took forever to get to us even though there were only two other tables being occupied in the restaurant. It was NOT busy. She kept messing up our order and asked us repeatedly what we had ordered. Overall very disappointing."}
{"text":"Went with co-workers for dinner, drinks, and dancing. Service was good. Ordered a pizza, lamb skewers and grilled calamari. The lamb was delicious, so got another order. Grilled calamari: nothing special. Nice big patio. Later in the evening (Friday night) the inside bar turns into a club-style lounge. Pool tables in the back are available (credit card deposit required).  Fun spot, check it out!"}
{"text":"me + 10 other girls went to Spacco to celebrate my friends birthday on saturday 20th of december. It's a small restaurant/bar and they have pool tables on one side. This was by far the best experience I've had at a place such as this. I think what set our experience apart was the fact that all the staff was smiling (including the bouncers) everyone was sooo happy and soo nice. Our waitress (cant remember her name but she had a blond bob) was super friendly and sweet. I never once felt that we were an inconvenience to her and she took the time to make it a wonderful experience for us. Great night and highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Came to this place for a friend's birthday. I remember having a pretty fun time when I first came here years ago. They had nice \"sounding\" food but it was definitely not worth the price. I got the Salute Pizza as I thought you can't really mess up a pizza. I was wrong. The eggplant was heavily flavoured in balsamic vinegar. The crust was decent but it wouldn't be something I order again. The drinks are also quite pricey. The one really good thing was that the bartender left to look for whipped cream for me so I can humiliate my friend by making him drink a blow job shot with no hands haha!  Now, for the actual place. It was a nice atmosphere. They had a large patio but you have to walk down a sketchy looking alleyway. You can easily miss this place if you weren't looking out for it. Thank goodness for Google Maps right? It's cool because they have a lot of pool tables in the bar area and a small dancefloor. Depending on the night I guess it will determine if anyone would be willing to bust a move. The night I went was not the case. But then again, I'm a one person dance party so it didn't really bother me too much.  I would only come back here if my buddy was having another birthday party here...if I couldn't convince him to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a friends birthday. The place was hidden but it was very nice inside. The pizza was really good and the cider even better! Nice modern place which isn't too dressy. Can imagine it gets busy on weekends."}
{"text":"I think this place deserves just two and a half starts but I can't choose this option :(. I went to Spacco yesterday on a date with my fiancé, the service was slow but it didn't bother us since we could talk and enjoy each other's company. We found the food ok, the desserts no good, specially the tiramisu that doesn't taste like tiramisu at all and doesn't look like it either.... This place is pricey for what they deliver. They also included 15% of tip in my bill...."}

{"text":"What an amazing restaurant! Gorgeous interior, very trendy location (behind my all time favorite cupcake shoppe of all places!), friendly waiter, amazing food, easy access by TTC. Dont have 1 bad thing to say, how could you?! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"We came to Spacco's for a friend's birthday this weekend.   Here's the breakdown of the place:  Food: 4 stars Decor: 3 stars Ambiance: 2 stars Service: 1 star  Let me just start by saying that the food was the only good thing about Spacco's. I had the rare beef appetizer and the champagne risotto for my entree. The risotto was AMAZING.  Now for the rest:  We were having a few drinks before dinner and the waiter suddenly came up to our table and told us we needed to pay our bill now because he was moving to another section of the restaurant and we would get another waiter. This was the first clue that the service was going to be odd and awful.  Our next waitress was a friendly, yet inexperienced, young waitress by the name of Alina. It started off OK. We ordered our food and drinks without any problems.   However, after that it all went downhill. It took a ridiculously long time to get our food and when the food did arrive, only 4 out of 6 of us got served. I was one of two that didn't get served. The waitress assured us that our food was coming out shortly and that we didn't get them all at the same time because we were on separate bills (Really? I've been to literally hundreds of restaurants where separate bills were requested and the food still came out at the same time for the table.)  In the mean time, two other people showed up at our table and ordered their food. Twenty minutes later, their appetizers arrived at the table, yet the two of us STILL didn't even have our appetizers! I reminded Alina that we still hadn't gotten our food and was told, again, that it was coming shortly. I'm fairly certain she never even gave our order to the kitchen until that point. Remember when I said we got the rare beef appetizer? Yeah, RARE BEEF = No cooking required. This should have been the first thing that was served!  Partway through our dinner, some genius decides that it's time to crank up the Gino-beats to full volume. Since we had a speaker right above our heads, we could no longer carry any form of conversation short of yelling at each other.  About an hour after ordering, our food FINALLY arrived and was devoured in no time.   Finally, after 30 minutes of trying to catch the waitress' attention (not once did she come back to our table after the last two of us were served), we got fed up and all walked to the bar to get our bills. THIS SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY!  Half of our bills were screwed up, with the wrong items on the wrong bills (there were only 4 bills for the table...).  I had already opened a tab at the bar prior to being seated and I had been told that it would be no problem to get it added to my food bill. That is, until our lovely waitress told me that it couldn't be done and I had to go pay my bar tab separately. The bar tender was confused and said that it would be no problem adding it to my food bill. So back to Alina I went and finally got the whole bill combined.   For a table that ordered over $500 worth of food and drinks, the service we got was piss poor and not worth even the 10% tip I gave our waitress.  Since I've been told by others of shitty service at this place and I've now experienced it myself, I will definitely not be coming back or recommending this place to anyone. Ever.  The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the chef knows how to make a damn good risotto."}
{"text":"I think the food isn't all that good but if you're out drinking playing pool or just hanging out this isn't such a bad spot to do so.. They have a fairly large patio area for summer days and nights as well"}
{"text":"I used to live in this hood and when I did I wasn't old enough for the SPACCO crowd. Now... I'm still not old enough for the crowd but getting there (sigh. I hate getting older). The place has a weird vibe. Neither pub/ club / bar or resto, it tries to do all things. We we arrived the DJ was spinning old school hits of the early 2000s / late 90s and they were playing curling on the TV.   My friends and I got a pool table and watched the action unfold. Place has a bit of a meatmaket feel. Not really my vibe, but if that's what you are into I'm sure it'd be adequate."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night! Good service. I got a really delicious pizza that had anti-pasta toppings on it with prosciutto. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Don't ever go there!!! Went there after work with some co-workers this past Friday night and we all had a shitty experience. Reservations were made in advance, yet they could not accommodate us. The first time I went there, they overcharged me by a small amount. It wasn't worth fighting over so I just walked away from the situation. The second time I went there, we used a Groupon so we were charged accordingly. We just didn't receive all the food we were entitled to. We never received our desserts and the waitress brought our entrees an hour after we got our appetizers! At the end of the night, I had to chase down the waitress just to pay my bill. Shitty service and mediocre food!!!"}
{"text":"Came by here earlier tonight for a few hours to get together with some acquaintances. Nice venue, and whoever the guy behind the bar is a great FOH person - really bubbly and friendly.   Server was attentive, drinks were priced appropriately for the area ($8 for a cocktail, it's Yonge/Eg). Didn't order any food.   Pool tables could use some maintenance but still serve well for shooting a few games.   Space is large and well planned out.   Curious what it would be like on a weekend evening.   3 stars because it wasn't anything outstanding, wasn't bad at all either though."}
{"text":"I have been dropping by this pool joint for a while and all I can say is that it's alright. The food is so-so, nothing special but tasty although overpriced for what you get.   Actually the whole place is overpriced. You are looking at mostly pizza and pasta dishes on the menu which are not up to par for what they charge, even if it is just a few bucks over on some of the dishes. The pool is $20/hr which is ridiculous when places like the Rivoli which is a far more focused pool hall charges $8/hr. I went there with a friend and in between two hours of pool and a few drinks we blew through $90+.   The decor is a bit on the modern side with some grayish/white walls and dark brown/black furniture. I must admit the place is not bad on the eyes, but it is far from a sight-gasm.  The patio is alright and usable for a second or third chill-out date with wine. The vibe is not too bad there.  Although I would not suggest going on, or on the day before North York's garbage day as you can at times smell the garbage piles on the other side of the wooden fence on the north and north/west sides. Near the end closer to Alleycatz, specifically during the warmer months.   The only reasons why you would go there for real is if you have a larger group after say a movie or you need a pool hall/drinks/maybe some snacks and you are forced and must hangout in the Yonge and Eglinton area."}
{"text":"went here with a friend for a drink as we were too lazy to go downtown. impressions are below: - bartenders have a tendency to ignore you big time - DJ on that particular night didn't know what he was doing (or at least it seemed that way) - there is not that much space for dancing but people still do that and we loved it! - would also like to try a billiard game here - no cover to enter so that's also good=)   it also seems to be a very good spot for big groups as there were at least 3 massive groups of people celebrating birthdays."}
{"text":"For me this is the perfect place to bring together friends with different opinions on what to do on a Saturday night. You've got music, pool, good food all in one place.   I came here for a birthday party, and loved the fact that Spacco is tucked away in the back of all the other Yonge/Egnlington store fronts, it made me feel cool to be going into a \"secret\" place.   Now you probably shouldn't plan to throw a big billiards tournament here as it will cost you $20/hr. But everything else is fairly priced for the area."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner and paint night.  I was a little leery after reading reviews, but we had a great time.  Service was prompt and our server was very patient with us rushing off to start our paintings.  We shared the Caesar salad, Arancini and Calamari - all delicious.  I had the wild mushroom ravioli which was also really tasty.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"Same waitress and guess what happened. Bad service, again. Can I request for myself not to have the same waitress? If I could, I would."}
{"text":"Was looking for a patio in the 'hood and finally found Spacco when I started working at my current place of employment.   Colleagues at work rave about this place all the time. I was intrigued and decided to take the opportunity to dine here because out-of-towners were visiting Toronto.   The patio is quite big (most in the area are tiny) and as this place isn't right on Yonge, so it's quiet. Pricing is pretty reasonable... You won't have to call Gail Van-Oxley to star in 'Til Debt Do Us Part after eating at Spacco. The list of wines available is not huge, but it's still significant.   Would love to check out their nightlife scene. As we were leaving, the DJ was starting to set up.   My friend ordered a pizza and she said that it was delish. The other 2 Dining Companions ordered the seafood risotto. They had no negative things to say. I ordered the grilled calamari with spicy garlic and olive oil.**   We all left content so I will be back!  A solid 4 star.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ** The grilled calamari is an appetizer; however, it's a perfect meal. It comes with grilled veggies as well."}
{"text":"I love this place - it is just a fun place to chill with friends.  Good drinks, Good bartenders.  Skip this place on the weekends at night if you hate loud music.  It can get a little loud.  Sang - do you still work here?  I miss your gorgeous flowing asian Man-Hair!!!  They have about 5 pool tables and a large outdoor seating area which is great for the summer time.  Food is pretty decent but not mind-blowing."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty sweet patio considering it's in the Yonge and Eglinton area...it really reminds my of St-Sulpice for anyone that knows Montreal, although not as large.  I like the fact that it's far enough back from Yonge that you really have no idea where you are...I'm not the biggest fan of the limited beer selection. Come here to hangout outside with a group of friends, not for a night of 'philosophizing' over a great Belgian beer."}
{"text":"My 4 friends made a reservation for a Wednesday afternoon for 6pm. We were there to use a Groupon.  We were seated outside & it's a large patio. However, there were tiny leaves from the trees covering the chairs & ground. This really should have been swept up & the chairs cleaned off.  We started with drinks & the waitress was great. Once we mentioned a Groupon her attitude changed. It was almost as if we were an inconvenience and she shouted across the patio several times \"your Groupon, it's a whole different thing, you have different menus\". It was imbarassing!  Since we order from the \"other menu\" I'm not sure if the real menu is any better. We were overall not impressed with the food. We all agreed it's about a 6/10.  What were were NOT impressed with is that the server stated it is house rules that they charge us on the tax on what our meal would be without the Groupon. Also, an automatic 18% tip was added (again to the total amount prior to the discount).  We attempted to discuss this with the waitress but she again said \"house rules\".  We would have left the same amount for a tip but dislike being told how much on a party of four.  We all said we will not return because we felt taken advantage of & did not like that we were treated differently because using a Groupon.  Too bad...groupon & other discounts are great ways to try new places and hopefully what to return as regulars."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday. No table, no reservations, just a large group of people milling around a pool table and a couple of tables that were free. This is just the kind of place for that.   First, you have to walk down the alley - but once you do, you'll see big letters in bigger lights that say SPACCO. Makes for a nice impression. Crowd is mixed and lively. There are some dining areas, a dancefloor, a bar, and pool tables. I've taken a couple of stars off because I often felt like I was intruding and not like a paying customer - and because the menu and food looks too expensive for what you're getting. Service was not prompt nor friendly, but ultimately got the job done? The caprese salad was good but was it worth 14$? I don't know. I didn't feel like it should be.   Overall, its a good place for a mixed crowd. I can see myself going there again maybe...if I was with some friends that wanted an elevated pool hall with a party atmosphere? And wasn't really hungry. Music was loud so don't expect a lot of conversation on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I had made reservations for a second date at Spacco. I've been here before years ago and saw some negative reviews but was looking for a good venue with pool tables - the only alternative was Rivoli and Charlotte Room... both booked solid.   The hostess was cool as was the guy who took my reservations. Bar staff were good too. But when my date arrived 20 minutes late, the server was no where to be seen. So basically the server had a 20 minute grace period she totally messed up.   I had to get the bartender to get her. She was beyond awful... we were in the wrong area with a corporate party and she wanted to move us. Ugh, no. We liked being seated in the corner.   She took our orders and served them with the subtly of a two-by-four to the head. In 14 years of Toronto restaurant experience, this was one of the worst servers in living memory. She was just beyond rude... I have a high tolerance for BS in this city but she broke it within a minute.   I asked for the bill afterwards... none. We went up to the cash register. She couldn't be bothered. So we left for Alley Katz. After 10 minutes at the bar, the bouncer from Spacco approaches me (I'm 6' 200lbs and this guy is twice my size). He asked if I had an outstanding bill... he brought me back, I paid it (with $0 tip). Funny thing is, the bouncer was pretty cool as it seems Spacco has had problems with this server before?   One the plus side, it made for a very entertaining date... Though not on purpose by Spacco."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant back in 2011.  I was really looking forward to this experience with a friend as the food on the website looked very decent.  Unfortunately, pictures can be deceiving.  The food was just mediocre, I definitely had better ones before, but to make it worst, the mussel pasta we ordered, the mussels were bad, bad as in they were expired and you can taste the garbage smell.  If the waitress didn't come apologize nonstop and was willing to give us another dish for free, I would of rated this 1 star.  I will just think the bad mussels were only a one off in awhile.  The scallops and the pizza we ordered were fairly decent.  Will I ever come back to here?  Probably not, there are tons of better restaurants around the area."}
{"text":"The place was nice so we decided to go. Nice sports bar with lot of pool tables. But the food and service was awful. Foods were too salty. And the service was rude. The waiter could not wait to take away our dish even though still there was food in it. I will never go there again"}
{"text":"Last time I was here, the patio was closed off for the winter! This is a definite hot spot for those uptown, or those who just dont want to deal with the downtown core headaches.  Patio is packed! the dance floor inside with the house dj is packed, its a popular place to be on the weekends if you're around Yonge and Eglinton.  A few of us guys decided to go SOMEWHAT healthy and have bottles...YES BOTTLES of their Beringer Cabernet along with their cured meats, chesses, olives, and red peppers served on a butchers board! Overall our server was very kind, helpful, and cute ;) lol... it was the perfect place since the night was perfect. I give this place a 3/5!!  I shall be coming back again Spacco!!! This place a little of everything, a dancefloor with a house dj, billards, and patio for those who just want to chill out."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and i've never been impressed. This last time i came for a work lunch and the people were rude. Not only rude to uss but to their coworkers.  For the food, for this function was buffet style and it was not good. Pizza was hard and overcooked. This rice ball thing, not even sure what it was. Plain salad with balsamic was safe. Calamari was decent.  They also served this jumbo ravioli serves with ricotta and spinach. It was decent, nothing to write home about but nothing that i was complaining about either.  But back to the rudeness, they were late bringing out food and they did not communicate this to anyone. We asked for more of the calamari, and were told it's not a bottomless pit. Also, we asked for the plates to be replaced because they were dirty; the waitress tried to get a new batch (which is fine), but one guy went and yelled at her cause we were all waiting and she was just trying to get clean plates. He ended up just getting some of the same dirty plates back and yelled at her for bringing smaller clean plates. Personally I'd rather just eat off something plain that is slightly small rather than large and dirty."}
{"text":"Want to hit up some balls?  Come here and play some pool - hahaha!  There are quite a few tables here so you can eat, drink and be a baller all at once.  I came here for a birthday - but we just played pool.  Surprisingly it was nicer on the inside than I thought it would be.  There are lots of booths to sit and have a meal.  Only one person ordered some food while we were there (a steak wrap) and said it was pretty tasty.  I took a quick glance at the menu and while not extensive (which in my opinion in not a bad thing) it had lots of interesting options.    The pool tables could use some minor maintenance and they could be spaced out a little more because I was always saying - excuse me, excuse me - so as not to ram my stick in some crotches, but other than that a pretty fun night.  Based on other reviews it seems like there is a patio in the summer, which might seem like fun to chill outside so I might come back and check it out in a few months"}
{"text":"*please note 3 stars is a generous rating considering there was a BIG HUGE BUG on our table*  We came here last night.  I read reviews before going, and they were pretty accurate.    Decor and Ambience:   The decor was pretty nice, the bar area looked good, with a brick or tiled wall.  We were seated on a bench, with a curtain behind us, separating us from some pool tables.  The curtain was very swingy and kept brushing against us.  The bar was kind of loud, but I think that's how it usually is.  Service and Food: The service was slow.  Our servers were quite nice, but towards the end of the evening we saw a HUGE ANT on our table near the our chocolate mousse cake, and I jumped about 3 feet, and eventually went over to the bar and servers to let them know.  The right thing to do would have been to apologize and probably take the dessert off our tab.  No such luck.    The food was ok, if not a bit salty (we ordered grilled calamari to start - super salty, and I would totally pass on this next time).  My friend ordered the steak salad, (it looked good), we had a pizza with sausage (ok), and my other friend order gnocchi (weird shape, with what they called a basil sauce, but it was pretty much just tomato). The cocktails were good - we had kir royales most of the evening.    If coming here in the future, don't expect speedy service, I'd be wary of the food, if there are ANTS in the dining room, who knows what's in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink and a slice of pizza after work. They have a pretty nice patio however it's quite dirty tbh as all the stuff from the trees is falling on the tables and chairs and no one bothers to clean it.  The service was very slow and i our server said they're very understaffed and she was basically the only one working.  The pizza was ok, but nothing special. Drinks were ok as well ( we ordered sangria) but a bit bitter for my taste.  The other cool thing I didn't know they had is pool tables but I didn't find out until we were about to leave. I might come back just for that)"}
{"text":"Yuck.  Where do I start? Came in here on Saturday for a friend's birthday for pool & drinks. We didn't eat here because I did read a bunch of terrible reviews on food but figured that they couldn't really get pool & drinks wrong. But boy was I wrong.  The night started off okay enough. We got there around 9pm (my friends got there a bit earlier and was able to grab a pool table). They wouldn't let her make reservations for a pool table unless she got bottle service. This place must be confused. The name says \"Restaurant and Bar\" but they are trying to be a club or lounge.  The quality of the pool tables were terrible. The felt was extremely dirty, it hadn't ever been cleaned before. The balls were also very dirty. There was a layer of dirt on them, they didn't have the shine they are supposed to have. If you're going to charge $18/hour for pool, the very LEAST you can do is clean the damn thing once in a while. What's the point in spending thousands of dollars on pool tables if you're not even going to maintain them?  The music got super loud at 10pm, and the environment turned club-like. The bar area turned into a dance floor and the DJ played some old music that was mediocre at best. What should have been a night lounging and chatting with friends, turned into a screaming match over the loud music. I couldn't even hear myself think.  Then my friend told me her brother couldn't get in because he was wearing runners. I'm not sure why they picked on him, most of the guys in our group were wearing runners and I saw a bunch of girls next to us wearing actual running shoes, as if they just came from the gym.  A waitress came by and started tabs for us. She seemed really friendly, but the worst had yet to come. At the end of the night, a lot of people from our group had already settled their tabs and left for the night. When my friend went to settle her tab, they kept insisting that one of the couples in our group didn't settle their tab and tried to make her pay for it.   That was when my other friend told us the last time she came here, they tried to do the exact same thing to her! They tried to make them pay for their friends \"unsettled tab\". Nice try.  One quick tip if you really MUST go here. Double check your bill. They charged us gratuities on the bill without even informing us.  Now I didn't try the food here, but based on what we experienced, I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great date spot. Patio is nice and the volume level isn't too loud. Service is good and the crowd is decent."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food. However, our table got their tiramisu and mine was half the size of a friend. Ours server's response : the sizes vary. So there you go, 1 star.  There are other restaurants with acceptable service in the area."}
{"text":"Groupon had a deal for a three-course meal for two, so my dining companion and I hit Spacco for an early dinner on a Friday night. As we arrived, we were impressed by the spacious patio and the waiter told us to just sit anywhere.  Though he brought us water right away, the waiter disappeared for many, many minutes before reappearing to take our drink orders.  I started with the Battered Calamari, which arrived shortly after and was quite tasty. The \"lemon caper aioli\" proved a strong complement and I will admit I enjoyed this appetizer quite a lot. My dining companion ordered the PEI Mussels, and these were not nearly as good. The mussels were unusually fishy and the tomato sauce was average (at best). I should also mention that the free bread was extremely subpar and even seemed to be a little stale.  Before the main arrived about a half hour later (!), the waiter essentially disappeared. My water and drink sat empty for at least 20 minutes. I realize he was busy with other tables, but this kind of incompetence is simply not acceptable.  For the main, I ordered the Culo Rosso Pizza, which comes with \"Italian sausage, hot banana peppers, caramelized shallots, mozzarella.\" This was a perfectly average pizza. It was better than Dominos or Pizza Pizza, sure, but it was also a far cry from any of the myriad high-end pizza places in the city.  Dessert was an Iced Chocolate Brownie and it was almost inedible. The brownie was hard and tasteless, while the accompanying ice cream was unreasonably icy. My dining companion's Tiramisu didn't fare much better.  If not for the horrible service, I would say Spacco is worth a try if you've got a cheap Groupon like I did. But given the mediocre food and the atrocious service, I would definitely say it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Some friends and I randomly found ourselves at this hideaway one night when Alleycatz was charging a cover we didn't want to pay.   I absolutely loved the outdoor patio, the inside is arranged kind of weird, however. They have pool tables set up but then they started playing loud music (Saturday night). For the people playing pool it was kind of weird navigating around the tables. They kept bumping in to each other and other people...  I feel like it's another one of those Toronto establishments that has a crisis of identity. Why would you have loud Top 40 playing at a Billiard Bar?  My search for a great place to party in Toronto continues..."}
{"text":"Friend came in from out of town and some stupid people picked this restaurant for dinner after I told them it was crap.    Everybody that served us was nice enough but it could not over shadow the slow service and mistakes.   We ordered drinks ;   Tomato juice turned into Clamato juice which I am severely allergic too ( not to mention all the shot they put into the Clamato).  How could they screw this up so easily?   Next the food.    Steaks are simply BAD and not tasty.    Pasta SO small that my husband was starving after dinner.   Calamari was chewy and just alright.    When one steak was sent back because it was no sauce, only veg and no potatoes ... it came back with no asparagus only peppers!    What?    Never again will I go there and I would not recommend them for any kind of gathering ever"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday a few months ago. Another friend had suggested it as their favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto. As a whole, our group was left unimpressed. The food was just okay, not great, and the service was slow. Normally, I'd excuse the service if a restaurant is busy, but this place was quiet on a Saturday night and it still took a while for the food to arrive, plus one of the orders got messed up and took even longer to be fixed. At least they agreed not to charge for that one."}
{"text":"We had a team lunch that we booked and pre-arranged buffet style food and pop (includes) for about 30 per person.  Time was set for 12:30 - group arrived on time (20 ppl) - sat down.  No waiter.  12:45 I approach the bar and ask how much longer for table service and food.  Response - oh we haven't started it yet did you want us to?  I was pretty annoyed now 20 min in to lunch and nothing on the way.  No drinks, no food, and an attitude - great.  Folks tired of waiting wandered up to the bar and ordered drinks.  12:45 food starts to arrive.  6 small pizzas 1 plate of green salad (not large) 1 plate of ceasar (not large) 10 risotto balls cut in half 1 plate calamari 1 plate spring rolls (mini) 1 pan (large) full of tomato giant ravioli - you know the kind where the pasta is HUGE and the filling is the size of a quarter.  That's IT!!  Yes folks that was 600 dollars.  Oh I forgot - a stack of DIRTY plate - NO JOKE!  No apology either.  I asked ' can we have another plate of calamari and rice balls' to which they answered ' this is NOT a bottomless pit - what you see is what you get) - by the way those plates were empty by the time person 8 (of 20) had made it through the line.  To this - a mandatory gratuity of 15% was added!  Did i point out there was no table service at all?  Such a huge disappointment - just don't do it!"}
{"text":"Friday nights and Saturday nights r fun! Love the music. Mostly top 40's but a great mix of 90's music ! Love it. I haven't eaten there too much but the few times we did was not bad. I would go eat there again... Yes."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place can still be in business. I`ve been years ago and I`m so glad my last experience proved that I haven`t missed out on anything.  We had a holiday work function booked for the late-afternoon. The tables and booths were dirty.... obvious crumbs that I easily brushed away, but should've been done BEFOREHAND, by the staff.  The food in mediocre (probably a lot of frozen items, like calamari, spring rolls, etc) and the service is not horrible but not all that great. Drink prices are high (1 pint of domestic [NOT premium] and a vodka-orange was $14). One of the bartenders was eating his meal  BEHIND the bar, while he worked!! When I waited tables, staff was to eat in the staff room or in the dining room, off to the side - never while they worked, especially in front of patrons. Seeing the bartender slurp down his noodles in between serving drinks was such a turn-off.   Anyway, I`m glad I went on work`s dime as I won`t be rushing back on my own."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often, and used to be their biggest fan before they changed the chef. They used to have delicious oven baked jumbo shrimps wrapped in prosciutto and served with aoli sauce.  Unfortunately they don't serve it anymore because 'it takes too long to prepare' as one waiter told me recently.   The place is still very good. I especially love their fresh buffalo mozarella. Bellinis are delicious and not very expensive.  Staff is friendly and prompt. In the summer, they open up the patio which gets pretty crowded but still great on Friday nights.  I am not a fan of their club nights, but for each their own. Thankfully they do have a separate seating area where you can sit down for drinks and have a convo with friends.  I'd recommend that place :)"}
{"text":"Went there with my mom. I would not have otherwise found this place as it's a little 'off the beaten path'. My mom had the Seafood risotto & enjoyed. We shared the Portobello mushroom stuffed with seafood as a starter that was very tasty. I had the Striploin Salad which was almost too pretty to eat & quite delicious. They only had one dessert but the Tiramisu was excellent.  Only negative was they already added a 17% tip to the bill which I thought was a bit high..."}
{"text":"It was great when I went there.  Service was great (Maybe a little too touchy for my taste) but otherwise fine. I had the Aranccini and a few beers. Quality stuff. I'd recommend the patio for those interested.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"You know it's pretty bad when the only good thing I have to say about this place is that the bread was great!  The appetizers took forever to come out and they were not really worth the wait. The main courses were pizza, pasta, steak salad, and risotto. The pasta was over cooked, the risotto was flavourful however it was mushy, the steak in the salad was supposed to be cooked medium rare but it was served well done.....the 4 of us were not impressed! If this was my restaurant and I was trying to attract new customers with a Groupon, I would go out of my way to provide the best service and food to retain the new clients to keep them coming back!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Bitchy waiters. Food took forever. Over an hour. And it was overpriced. Avoid if possible"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni some other meats and different kinds of cheese, for take out. Was great, the pizza was very delicious, the dough is really something special, that old European style dough where the extra crispy parts are the most flavourful. The dough was a little thin for my preference, but I'm not taking any stars off for it, it's a very well made pizza.   The interior is very upscale and they have  a dress code to keep it that way, No Sweat Pants, No baseball caps etc...  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"VIBE  I was here for a Christmas lunch so I can't really comment on the patrons (nor was there any around). The space is pretty big with a back area for playing pool. Unfortunately, the service was not the best. There was no water at our table or mention of until we requested it. We weren't told what wine we were having. Our waiter knocked over wine twice. The music was also on loud but it was turned down at our request. I'd come back here for playing pool and drinks if I was in the area.  Note: down the alley way near Alley Cats at the back.   WE ATE We had a pre-fixe menu. We had a mix of fried calamari (ok), bruschetta (also ok) and salad. Romaine lettuce with balsamic vinegar does not a salad make!  We had a selection of mains. I had a the chicken risotto. No flavour and not creamy as advertised! The penne with chicken tasted a bit better.  The best part was the tiramisu. It was the perfect size!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  It's not amore! Sorry. I think it's more bar than restaurant but for my money, I'm not buying the food here unless it's a mini dessert as a night cap. But I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"We came here for a company lunch. I was advertised to look over the menu on the website a head of time. Checked out the $10 menu and decided to have the smoked chicken risotto.   The risotto was pretty good. Served on a large dish, the portion of the risotto was rather small. Some of my colleagues ordered the calzone and they were huge.  If you are gonna come here for lunch, i recommend you order anything outside of the pasta & risotto section."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. They have a limited menu of pizza and pasta with some appetizers. We had a fried calamari and a mussels appetizer, followed by various pizza, pasta and calzones as entrees. Food wasn't terrible but no one was making any comments about it's deliciousness. No love in the food.  Spacco does have a decent patio. Interior is spacious with pool tables and lounge like seating inside.   Our service was adequate.   Prices are around $14-$20 per entree and appetizers were $10-$14.   I can't see why I would come back."}
{"text":"Spacco is a pretty popular spot in the summer thanks to its off-the-beaten-path patio!  Even though the patio fills up on the regular, there seems to always be ashortage of waitstaff, meaning you'd better order for the rest of the night when you get your chance! To make a point I have had the pleasure of waiting a full hour for a mixed drink, as well as having the waitress forget completely what I had ordered.  The food is just ok, and the pizza is probably the best bet, though I found the spaccato a bit too salty (sausage, sun-dried tomato etc).   Spacco also has several pool tables, which are available for an unreasonable $20/hr! That being said, you know you can find an empty table here at almost any time!  In brief, give it a go if you are looking for a place that can accommodate a large group and have forgotten to plan ahead!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. It's the service that has me not so impressed. I reserved for a party of four. Two of my guests got there before me and the hostess refused to seat them telling them there was nothing under my name. I arrived about five minutes later and told her there absolutely was. She then proceeded to seat us on the patio--in a pretty crappy spot I might add...but not before she assumed we were using a Groupon...nice. We weren't by the way. I guess we just looked like the \"type\" to her...whatever that is. But I kind of wish we had gotten a discount considering.  After we were seated we were brought water. We ordered our drinks and waited. They arrived and the waiter placed them haphazardly on the table--he could barely remember what belonged to which guest.   We ordered our food, and I ended up ordering an appetizer...which ended up being served after the main course.   The food, like I said, was delicious. Rich and filling. Even the brownie and ice cream we ordered for dessert was great despite the fact that it was served less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which had us skeptical.   Like I said the service could be improved though. Our waiter was a bit of an odd duck. He mixed up our orders, bumped into my friend without even noticing and at one point even had his butt in my friend's face as he was serving another table.  Finally the whole one bill thing is just stupid. Unless you're with a family or on a date, what is the point? And in this day and age how is that you can't separate the bill. Just dumb. Be prepared to deal with the foolishness of having to do the math yourself."}
{"text":"I just came here today and let me start off by saying.. NOBODY WAS THERE!! I came in at exactly 8:00PM (I looked at my phone right when we walked in, by we I mean me and my guy friend).. The food wasn't bad but I will explain why the 2 stars.. and to be honest I will give the food a 3 out of 5.. Okay we ordered 2 plates of mussels, 1 with the red wine sauce and the second with the white wine sauce (the mussels were not the freshest) not only that.. there was a FLY in the white wine sauce mussels! That's unacceptable! We let our waitress know and her reply \"Oops.. That's never happened before\".. She wasn't really apologetic about it, nor did she take it off the bill (we still payed for it).. I ordered the battered calamari and she came with the grilled calamari (after I specifically told her I wanted the battered one).. She switched it, but with attitude and then came back with the right order within 2 minutes.. I said to her \"That was fast\" and she was like \"Yeah.. the chef was making some for himself so It came quick\".. After that she started playing nice. I got the 'Amore Pizza\".. which was good, I enjoyed it and I still have some in the fridge, I had to get it as take out since it was Filling, better for me, I got left overs :P he had the lobster pasta with white wine and he enjoyed his meal (he finished it). Would I go back again? I don't know........... I seen a Italian place near called 'La Vecchia' or something like that.. That is a place I would rather try, I don't think I'm ever coming back here again, but it's not horrible. Why were we the ONLY humans there in that restaurant? I guess the proof was the experience."}
{"text":"Last Friday I was invited out to this restaurant for a night of mingling and drinks.. This had been my first time at Spacco's but had heard great things prior to going. We enjoyed drinks on their patio which i found fairly large considering this restaurant is located in the Yonge and Eglinton area.   Our server was friendly, very sociable, and knew how to keep a smile on the entire groups face. Prior to arriving i was told that the server made a mistake by bringing and opening a bottle of white wine while the table ordered red. Right after i arrive the server came with a rounds of shots for the entire group to apologize for the mistake.   I have always been hesitant to attend any outings on Yonge because usually it is a hassle to try and find parking. I was surprised i was able to find a decent size parking lot about a block away and even more surprised that when i went to pay at the end of the night it was only $5.00!!! That's a steal in Toronto..  The atmosphere inside this restaurant was nice, they had a live DJ playing top music and a dance floor opened for people to dance, There were also a number of pool tables located inside. I can tell by just walking through the restaurant to go to the bathroom it seemed there were a lot of regulars in the place very comfortable with their surroundings..  Great for a night out to social and mingle"}
{"text":"This review is only on service, since I had not received my food.  Made an order online for take-out, order was accepted by restaurant. 20 minutes after the order was placed, and accepted the restaurant cancelled the order I received a message saying the restaurant was closed. I ordered at 820pm their hours were till 930pm. When I called the restaurant they said they were open and that if we wanted to come in quick to eat that we could. So when I then continued to tell him who I was and asked why my order wasn't received, he quickly said well the kitchens closed now. Never ordering from this place again, even if the food is good, the service was terrible!!"}
{"text":"Nasty service. Service: This was my first experience at Spacco, which happened to be on a Friday night.  Our server had a bit of attitude. It felt like he was doing us a favour by doing his job. He came to take our drink order and completely disregarded me(he took 3 out of 4 orders). I went to get his attention by \"grabbing\" his arm, in which he informed me politely but FIRMLY (and a bit rudely) that I shouldn't be grabbing his arm.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a date. I feel like your date would end up pissed off or annoyed with the servers attitude.  Food: I ordered the Don Cleo sandwich with a garden salad. They only had a balsamic vingarette, which I thought was surprising because every restaurant I've gone to has at least ranch or even caser. The dressing was extremely vinegary and I couldn't enjoy the salad. The sandwich was pretty bland, but the large chicken portion was surprising.   Atmosphere: We sat outside on the patio which was fairly busy. It would have been nice to hear the music from the inside on the patio. After dinner we went and took a look around the place and it was pretty busy. Not too many people on the dance floor and a handful of people playing billiards.   Suggestions: If you do want to come to Spaccos I suggest sitting outside on the patio, but I wouldn't bring a date here. It has a casual dress code which is nice. Would I come here again? Probably not."}
{"text":"Definitely a cool place, especially if you are big into pool. But minus 2 stars for having a creepy guy in the bathroom.  Like, we can dry our own damn hands; get a real job."}
{"text":"Really do not understand the low ratings here.  Really!  I have had nothing but a great time since forever!  I think I've been here off and on for 20 years - yeah...I know, a bunch of you are doing some math and thinking - damn he's doing good for his age!  Or maybe not!  ;)  For those who want to know the 5W's of the place.  What = a restaurant/bar/pool hall all in one.  No need to go to a bunch of places to get in all your evening action.  I do the whole pool/bar thing on rainy/winter days.  I do the patio/restaurant thing during the \"Toronto weather is great\" days.  Serves great pizza's, italian/med food, lots of ALcooL products.  Where = north of Eglinton, on Yonge, sandwiched between Erskine and Broadway (me thinks!) and I do mean sandwiched.  It is in an Alley with the AlleyCatz restaurant - across the street from Best Buy.  Who - what do you mean who?  You...that's who that needs to try the place.  There is usually an owner during the busy hours to make sure that that place runs smoothly - or make the call on unruly guests.  When - check the app for open times.  Best times are obviously peak party time.  If you want to grab a meal and shoot some pool without the crazy peeps - just after the lunch hours is good.  Why - cause I need a drink and be where a bunch of people can hang out.  Place is well put together.  Parking is a premium and pool is not cheap to play but when you break the cost down between a bunch of sharks, it's not bad.  Also, where else can you play pool and get some good food - not at your local seedy pool hall!  My usual thing is wine/beer/pizza and pool.  Drop by...say hi to Paul at the bar and Sang.  Cheers!"}
