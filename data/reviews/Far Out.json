{"text":"Happened to walk by around 5pm and noticed they had 'local craft beers' ( made in the Lombardi region ) and there was no one in there.  Thomasso was the only server/bartender on staff, and he quickly educated us about the brew... We ended up staying about 5 hours, and the place filled up!  
Great, friendly and attentive staff.... wayyyyyyy better than the dining we had at the the restaurants on the water side street... 
Our only regret is that we didn't find them earlier in our stay....
Great food....!  

Pasta with camarones and langostinos, fresh salad and a great selection of wine ( oh yeah... we tried the wine after the beer, finished with cappuccinos and grappa)... 

The atmosphere was friendly, not overly stuffy... 
Like I said, we just walked by and popped in for a beer, and before you know it, it's filled with the kinda tourist that brings too many bags with them, because they need diner jackets and collars.  I'm sitting in there with my sailing tshirt on ( because we were planning on going back to the room and putting on a collared shirt), but being as we were traveling through Europe, light ( meaning 1 bag a piece), and we had enough beer we thought we should eat, we did.... best decision we made!   

Go there.... pass the Dulac, pass the Suisse, go to Far Out.... drink some beer, drink some wine, by all means EAT....

Great place.....!  Great staff!  Great food!"}

{"text":"Had a great experience at Far Out a friend had recommended it.  The Valtellina was amazing.  Best Ravioli I have ever tasted.  The fish and chips were different and excellent.  The Gustosa and spaghetti with bacon was delicious as well.  Good friendly service."}
