{"text":"I with wife and another couple went to dine here, albeit somewhat late. Wait staff seemed in a hurry to close. Couple shared a nice dish, and wife ordered salad. I ordered a large plate of traditional food to share. Couples food was good, salad nothing special, but mine was of poor quality. Heaping amount of food that had been cooked to long back and was not edible. Rather than send back and cause a scene I left with others. Examples was beef pieces cooked almost to charcoal, fried plantains hard as shoe leather, etc. I SHOULD have been told to order something else but it seems like the restaurant was willing to dump food on me that was probably recooked when I ordered. Likely won't go there again"}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad. We've been long-time visitors of Delicias Colombianas on South Blvd, so I was happy to find another Colombian restaurant close by. This place definitely has DC beat on ambiance- it's a cute restaurant and nicely decorated, plus they also have a nice little outdoor eating area and a couple of TVs (tuned to soccer).  Started with an empanada and pan de bono each- both awesome! Their pan de bono is actually the best I've ever had (but if you want to try them or any of the other baked goods, you might want to go for lunch- they do all their baking in the morning, and when it's gone it's gone!). Then we moved on to the paradilla (a large platter of grilled meats, with fried onions and peppers) which came with fried plantains and rice on the side. Not the best I've had, but it was pretty good- and at $20ish for two people it isn't a bad deal.  I'll definitely be going back, as there are some other things on their menu I can't wait to try. One item my husband was excited to see is sancocho, which they don't serve at DC."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!  Went here for lunch today with a couple of co-workers.  They have great weekly lunch specials. Check out their website for more information. For $7.50 (with tax) you get a soup, drink and choice of daily special. All specials come with rice, salad and fried plantain.  I ordered the steak in black sauce. Absolutely fantastic. Flank steak cooked just right and smothered in a tasty black sauce. The salad was fresh and topped with pickled beets, which I adore. The dressing was akin to a ranch but a bit sweeter. The rice was not overcooked and the fried plantain was a great compliment. My co-workers ordered the pork loin with mushroom sauce and the baked chicken, both stated they would order their dishes again!  I can see this easily becoming a regular lunch stop.  Service with a smile, lick your plate clean food and respectable prices, there is no reason this place can't receive anything but a 5 star rating from me.  Try this place for lunch! Fabulous!   Steve H."}
{"text":"Love this place we go there at least 3 to 4 times a month - the food is delicious the prices are great the servers are friendly and it has a family atmosphere. Also we like that the food is always consistent. We love the chicken in lemon sauce and also their margaritas. We rather go there that to some of the expensive places we have tried and come out hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. They were always on point when my drink was getting too low. Food came out fast and their lunch specials are 1) amazing and 2) a pretty good deal if you're not trying to break the bank. Love how the lunch comes with the soup. Definitely a place you must go to if you like authentic South American food."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic food. Tried the tostones, empanadas, maduros, yuca, and the chicken and steak entrees - all were delicious. The service is great and the prices are affordable. Great experience across the board."}
{"text":"Hell yes. I'm giving this place 5 stars because of how great the food was. I will not even take into consideration the insanely low lunch prices (bonus) and how friendly the staff was even when I attempted some gringo spanish for the fun of it (I asked my daughter where her little hands where, Donde esta tu manitas? or something mangled like that).   I will definitely go back for seconds and to try dinner- If it was anything like the awesome fried pork with mushroom sauce, fried plantains and brilliant potato soup I had for lunch, I might do a subsequent 5 star review then too. Hey now."}
{"text":"I was attending a Wine and Canvas event next door with a friend and we decided to aarp by next door to Los Paisas.  We were not disappointed.  Since it was our first time we were each given a beef patty to try.  Delicious!  I would order them again for an appetizer.  The entree was delicious too.  I had the grilled chicken with mushroom sauce and she had the grilled trout with butter sauce. Come and enjoy because you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Totally Colombian!  when i say totally im picking on one of my friends who says that about eveything almost. look at the photo of the plate and you'll see what we got, i asked if we needed to order more food, this was not the so called by the menu meal for two, this was a meal for one $10.99, it could have been a meal for three if you no all my friends are jocks you may not think this was alot of food, so in case you are blind and can not see my photo this was in it, red sausage, black sausage, potatoes, plantains kinda like baannas, limes, corntortias in chunks, tomatoes, beef,pork and something like chunks of bacon but about an inch thick and ok heres the deal this food was good but even though we used about half of the jar of all three sauces, so 1 1/2 total jars for two people and it could have been three it was still not the fullensee of flavor i expected but one of my friends said that is how it is suppoesd to taste,so i guess it may have been better if that is what you are used to and it made more than a few of my lists"}
{"text":"Stinking awesome delicious Colombian food wow. Good lunch specials.   I've had 2-2 great meals here.  Very consistent."}
{"text":"Muy bueno,me siento Como en mi tierra,el corrientazo bueno y barato ,la picada super recomendada el mejor de Charlotte."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole. Literally. The guacamole is heavenly , the beverages are amazing, every single piece of food was beyond delicious. I love this place. It's our new spot, great to find this GEM!!!! Can't wait to go back again. I wish I had a rewind button so I can just keep rewinding and re eating everything. Beyond flavorful and great atmosphere. A must have!"}
{"text":"One of the greatest lunch values in Charlotte the week day special comes with soup and an entree. All for $6. The food is great and the three salsa toppings are the bomb (not mexican red stuff here). The service has always been very prompt and professional."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great flavor. Friendly service. Well prepared and authentic. I spent 13 years doing business in Latin America and this gem is worth the drive.   I was in town on business and found them in Yelp.   Just go and eat! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"From the looks of it, Los Paisas may not seem like much, but once inside, strap yourself in, because you're going to treat yourself to one of the best culinary rides in Charlotte. As with any \"comida tipica\" (meaning \"authentic\"), you're going to get a lot of food. No, I mean A LOT OF FOOD. Come with an empty stomach. You won't be sorry.   For those of us who crave authentic, there's plenty to choose from. For those of you who might be a bit apprehensive, never fear, there's also plenty to choose from to satisfy your palates. Great menu for kids, too.   I grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York. Little Bogota. So I ate a lot of \"comida tipica colombiana\" back in the day. Los Paisas brought me back to my days running around on 82nd Street and Roosevelt Avenue. Simply put, there's authentic, and there's Los Paisas. Their dedication to authenticity is absolutely admirable, and we as the consumer will always benefit from this."}
{"text":"This place is live it's fresh, delicious and the service was great. Food was on point and the servings were definitely more than ample. Had a bandeja pasa and shared a parilla and this is true Colombian food, almost made me feel like I was back home in Miami. Definitely a place to come and eat alone or with friends and family."}
{"text":"Was traveling for business and was craving Colombian food.  I had the bandeja paisa, for the hungry and determined.  This dish has everything but the kitchen sink, chicharrón  (pork cracklings - there is a reason \"Crack\" is in the name), steak, rice, beans, avocado, sweet plantain, chorizo (Colombian sausage), and a fried egg!  It tasted great and very authentic.  The chicharrón was a little small but still tasted great.  The beans don't typically have too much flavor but these were well seasoned and tasted like homemade Colombian beans. On my way out I noticed they had breads (it's a bakery too).  I took some almojabanas (cheese bread), which were amazingly good, soft and warm...  Ac was broken but the food helped me troop past that!  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Love this place, I've been going for lunch for years- you just can't beat it for under $7!! Staff is amazing and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to return to this place! Here's why  1. Friendly quick service, but not too quick were you feel rushed. I was greeted promptly and seated quickly. I drank about 4 glasses of water and I never had to ask once for a re-fill. My food (app, soup, main dish) were all delivered in a timely spaced out manner.   2. Smaller but spacious restaurant dining side and bar side. Soft music and a soccer game was on.   3. Priced reasonably for the amount of food you get. ($1 empanadas)   4.  Delicious Colombian food! Homemade green sauce (aji sauce?) was given was soon as we ordered our food. And I think I used about half of the bottle. It was so good! The beef empanadas were large and so good topped with the green sauce. My boyfriend asked how many I wanted and I said one, so he ordered three (we share everything) and we ended up getting four, so....I ate two. I just couldn't stop!   5. Large portions: I ordered the daily special pork, rice, salad, and soup. My homemade chicken soup came in a large bowl and it was so fresh! The pork was grilled and seasoned. I love the rice, again topped with the green sauce! The salad was okay, it was tossed in dressing and seemed to be a pre-mixed blend.   I will return and tell my friends to come for some authentic Columbian food!"}
{"text":"I never leave reviews but I have to this time! The food was awesome, so abundant and the service was awesome! I have a Jew friend who only ordered a coke and the waiter gave her free! So awesome food!"}
{"text":"This is the place to get Colombian food in SC/NC! The service was superb and they wrote down your order as soon as you were ready. We started out with empanadas (meat patties), which were absolutely delectable! Then we ordered Milanesa de pollo (Breaded chicken), a Picada, and 2 bandeja Paisas. The Milanesa de pollo was so delicious and flavorful and the picada was excellent in every way. The bandeja paisas like always were a fan favorite at the end of the day. In the end, I absolutely recommend Los Paisas for the food, service, and fast ordering!"}
{"text":"Good homemade food love their soups and drinks. Steaks are very tender and also their sauces."}
{"text":"Im one of the few with a bad experience apparently.The steak was bland , the chicharrón had zero flavor and our waiter couldn't have cared less about providing decent service. We had to get up and track him down twice to place our order and get our check. He stoped to pick up his phone while taking care of us too... really disappointed and won't be coming back. To make matters worse there were flyes buzzing around to."}
{"text":"This is probably something everyone should try at least once. If you're used to mexican food, this might at first appear similar, but it's different enough to be worth the visit.The first thing I noticed that was different was that instead of tortillas, they served plantains with every dish. The rest of the dishes might be familiar enough, so don't think this will be something crazy that you won't have a clue what it is, it's all recognizable.  Overall the place is very clean and the staff is friendly. It's popular, which is well deserved by the attention they put into their preparation of the food. The portions were a good size too. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed."}
{"text":"Initially we wanted to go to a different restaurant nearby that was closed. I saw Los Paisas and it was crowded, which is always a good indicator for good food. I am normally very picky with my food, but this restaurant was good. I loved their fresh juices. They are just $3 and are freshly prepared. I had a mango and passion fruit juice. Both juices were very refreshing, came in a large sized glass and were just wonderful. If you don't like it too sweet, make sure you mention not to put too much sugar in your juice.  Also, I looved their black sausage. It is a blood sausage. People usually don't try blood sausage, but I would highly recommend this sausage. I wasn't too impressed with the ox tail soup, but it was home style and I think many people would like it. It was potato based. The ox tail was excellent. I am just not too big on potato soups in summer. Also, for my taste, it was a little \"plain\", but it is a classic potato based ox tail soup.  They have also a very good starter. It is guacamole with fired bananas that are like ships. It may doesn't sound great, but it was very good. I enjoyed it.     Overall, it was good food. I wouldn't call this cuisine \"exciting\", but it was very good home-style food with large portions. If you are new to this cuisine, start with starters. Ask to share one portion of the soup. It comes with rice and salad and will get you full. We shared a soup, had 4 starters, paid about $35 and were happy and full. It was good."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise on a trip to Charlotte.  If you want some authentic Colombian food. This is a must try.  Get the tipica plate.    Has it all."}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS, this food is authentic as it gets  and the portions are huge for the low. I got the Wednesday lunch special which starts out with a flavorful lentil soup which reminded me of my grandmothers, I would definitely go back just for that , next came the main course which was picadillo (steak with peas and corn ) and it was accompanied with rice , fried plantain and a side salad. That was lovely and so flavorful!! I also got an empanada which was nice and crisp the filling was very delicious. I also got an arepa with chorizo which was also a great dish, I got all this amazing food for only $13 . My only criticism for this business is the service, it could use some improvement  he took our order and only checked on us when we finished eating our meal but other than that the food is excellent and it has a great atmosphere ! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for any kind of Latin food and this place topped my list. Great service, fast turnaround, and delicious food! I will come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Started to come here quite often as my salsa dancing friends love the place.  I was attracted by the music the DJ plays for the Salsa and Columbia night.  Rarely eat now there as we mainly go there to dance.  Red wine is $8.- with a tiny tinny plastic cup.  Really feel like those teenagers party style.  Bucket of beer is only $6.- or a little more.  (Just never like beer except going to Germany, Belfast or UK) If it is not raining, this place is always jam packed. Most guests are from Colombia (my friend is) or South Americans. They need to do something for the floor if they really want to take care of customers who love to dance.  The floor is YUCK!  Even they have cleaned it up before the party time. As a whole, good party place."}
{"text":"Just flat-out delicious cuisine!  This is based on 3 meals that I have thoroughly enjoyed during lunch hour. The pictures on Yelp really don't do justice to the wonderful flavors that one experiences with each bite. I know that this review is sounding a bit cheerleader-ish but this is exceptionally delicious food.   I hesitate to mention this but I believe that their menu is under priced. When I watch the food shows on cable TV I see dishes that take 15, 20, 36 hours to prepare. This is one of those places (I'm guessing). It seems that the secret to Los Paisas is that they serve up slow food instead of fast food and, wow, you can really taste the difference.  They have 3 lunch specials every day (plus the menu dishes) and the specials are different each day. Order with confidence. I don't think you'll get a mediocre dish no matter what it is, so throw a dart and enjoy a properly prepared plate.  One thing that I will order every time I go in, is the guacamole app served with plantain \"chips\". Try this, it will change your life.  I find it interesting that Colombian cuisine does not rely on spicy peppers for flavor. They don't use chili's at all in the food but if you do like it hot, there is a 3 variety container of different pepper sauces that is brought to your table. Another interesting twist is that all the servers are men. They are all very professional and attentive. It's not really a \"thing\" but it is a difference that I haven't come across too often.  Lastly, the portions are very generous. I come away from a meal at Los Paisas feeling like I have just had something from someone's family recipe book. It's a real treat to find a well run, consistently great restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a small spot in pineville which will catch you by surprise. It's authentic Columbian food and it really does taste great. Try their milk based smoothie and if you are feeling fun add a shot of rum. Very tasty."}
{"text":"This is a super friendly little place.  I know the category says it's Brazilian food, but it's actually Colombian.  And apparently the Colombians don't believe in small portions.  When I first saw the prices on the menu I was kind of surprised, they were more expensive than similar places I've been to.  I had a to go order and I understood the pricing when the waitress brought out four separate boxes with all my food in them.    It was really tasty stuff too.  I had never had Colombian food before and was pleasantly surprised.  A little on the salty side, but still really good.  The restaurant itself is really cute too.  It kind of looks like an old Spanish country house.  The waitress was very helpful and sweet.  She gave me some really good suggestions."}
{"text":"Fabulous food!! The arroz con pollo will delight your tastebuds & the plantains & guacamole made me want to get up & dance. The live music during dinner was a lot of fun (a tad loud if you want to chat but great music).  The waiters are friendly & have fast service."}
{"text":"really good food my little girl loves their empanadas.  those are super delicious.  their food is fresh and good.  their staff is always very helpful."}
{"text":"As good as it gets! I was so thrilled to find a columbian restaurant close by where I work. The food was excellent. I ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana but got aside instead of the shredded meat. There was so much food I had the rest for dinner. Everything was tasty and fresh. The staff was very attentive. We will be going back. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The food is sooo delicious and is genuine Colombian food. Large portions for a great price and overall good atmosphere, would definitely recommend to anyone. I got the bandeja paisa and all the flavors were there and I left happily stuffed"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place and was pleasantly surprised.    Portions of food were great the quality of food was great and service was quick and friendly.   I can't wait to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere at this authentic Colombian restaurant.  Lots of variety on menu, generous portions and crazy low prices at lunch time.  Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"So good.  Get the juice.  It's addictive.  Maybe be a little more Colombian than you think, 'know wha' I'm saaayin???'"}
{"text":"The arroz con camarones \"rice with shrimp\" was absolutely delicious. They didn't just give me 2 or 3 baby shrimpshrimps either. We also got the Bandeja Paisa and it was all good. Maracuya (passion fruit) juice was perfect and the price you pay is very reasonable in my honest opinion. No complaints, only compliments!"}
{"text":"Super filling, flavorful with great service to boot! Kinda hidden in McMullen shopping center =) definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant for authentic Colombian food.  They usually have 2 different lunch specials for only $5.99 which usually consists of meat (I've had fish, pork, chicken and beef on different occasions), rice, salad, sweet plantains and their soup of the day.  I also order an empanada (only $1) on the side if I'm really hungry.  The service here is quick, nice and attentive.  They also just opened another location in the food court at Plaza Fiesta across from Carowinds (lunch special is $4.99, portions are just a little smaller but still very filling.)"}
{"text":"I could eat here every day, love Colombian food  and this is my to go place when I feel like eating Costa Rica food because the food is very similar to ours. Love the empanadas they are the best and my  favorite plate is the bistec encebollado that is  a good portion of beef in a tomato sauce with lots of onions and it is served with rice and beans , I think it comes with plantains but I'm not sure  you might want to ask , that is what I order every time I go there!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Had rice and beans. Beans were super salty - heart attack in the making. Rice was really good. I enjoy trying new things. Don't know if I want to come back here for a second time. Good to try for first time."}
{"text":"They have the best Colombian food here. The place is packed but luckily we got a seat right away. The service was fast we ordered empanada it was fantastic with the salsa. Foods are freshly made. We will go back to this place."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Great portions and great variety. I also enjoyed their fresh juice drinks where you're given an option to have it with water or milk. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Los Paisas has stolen my little Colombian food loving soul. I am crazy about plantains and yucca and LP carved a nice place in my heart! Finally made it in for lunch after hearing many good things from my wife and other friends.   The inside is quaint and houses a small bar, a handful of tables and a few TV's. Not over the top with decoration. Just simple and direct.   The staff was zipping around the dining area with multiple plates in hand. A wonderful Colombian culinary ballet was happening around us as we anticipated the arrival of our lunch.   We started with the Tostones con Queso. Green plantains with queso fresco. Only 3-4 on the plate, but perfect for two to share. These things are topped generously with fresh, melted cheese. Chewy plantains and melted cheese? Might as well be a bullseye.   I ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana. A menagerie of flavors, textures and traditional Colombian dishes. The pork cracklin' was by far the most interesting item on the plate. Fried pork skin. It's like a high-five in your mouth. Like a chewy pork rind but succulent. It's a mammoth-sized portion. I'd recommend trying a bit. Eating the entire portion would be a bit much. The steak, egg and sausage were all fantastic.   Here's the kicker. The herb mixes they bring to the table are the golden goose, the cheery on top, the KO punch and the holy grail rolled into one. Spices and herbs, olive oils that complement every dish rather well. Mixing each one in with the rice and beans....something I crave daily. Can't wait to come back in just for these.   Lastly, the agua frescas are immaculate. We tried the piña (pineapple) and loved it. Served in a tall glass with many fresh chunks of pineapple afloat. Loved every sip/gulp.   This is definitely one of our go-to's in Crown Town! Love you, Los Paisas!"}
{"text":"Reminds me so much of food back in Colombia. The closest I've have to taste like it's made back home."}
{"text":"They served me food to go that was inedible. Before I even noticed that the chicharrones were freezer burned, I tried to eat it. It was almost like eating a rock. I felt like it could have chipped my teeth. When I asked for a refund, the female employee ignored me for several minutes before another employee told her again to do it. I ate here previously and thought the food was mediocre and attempted to give it a second chance but NEVER AGAIN. Save your money and find another reputable and better tasting Colombian restaurant. I regret not doing so today. WARNING: Don't make the same mistake that I did."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place in my neighborhood. The big portions for low prices, nice servers, fast delivery and everything is so delicious. I have a slight obsession. My go to is the Milanesa or the flank steak. The empanadas are great and don't forget their sauces. Mm"}
{"text":"I agree with Jake B. you can not find a better lunch value in Charlotte and the food and salsa are great. Just want to add that they have started serving breakfast on the weekend. Order their Columbian breakfast that includesa a tasty steak (hanger?) eggs that are mixed with beans and rice. Not common breakfast fare for an American but it was great, plus the portion size was real big."}
{"text":"Omg...OMG THE FOOD IS SO FREAKING GOOD & full of flavor....So much on the menu that looks good. I branched out an ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana $12.95....I was going to order what I was use to ordering when I eat South American cuisine rhe  Arroz Con Pollo...so I tried the Columbiana and I order 2 beef Epanadas to start.. I had to sit at the bar because the place was so packed.  Amazing is a serious understatement to describe this dish. it was a lot of food I was so hungry I almost finished it all...I could have if I had not ordered the two Epanadas which were superb. The Colombiana had so many different textures & flavors ..tip make sure you mix the chimichuri sauce in with the white rice...& BOOYAW! When you combine the egg, rice n beans, steak, sweet plantains & avacado in one bite...DAMN makes you want to jump up an smack somebody.... this has to be the best South American restaurant in Charlotte... no wonder its in Balyntyne area....I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service!  I will be back to enjoy another terrific meal.  Enjoyed the live music too!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Colombian restaurant of all time! It was my second time at this place and again they exceeded our expectations! Service is great, menu has a lot of good options and their price is more than fair. To start we always order the beef empanadas, they were crunch and flavorful. The best empanadas I ever had! As entree we both had the Bandeja típica Colombiana that is rice, red sausage, egg, avocado, grilled beef, pork cracklings and plantains that I always switch to fried yucca. To drink I had guava juice that was really good too. You will be surprised to see how much food they serve. My husband and I barely could eat half of our plate.  The food was amazing!!! On the weekends they get busy but I've never seen a long line waiting for a table.  I have been to at least 4 Colombian restaurants in Charlotte but this one is so far the best!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great and quick service!  Fabulous Colombian food!   The beans were savory, the chicken and steak perfectly seasoned and cooked.    So happy i found this place."}
{"text":"Amazing Colombian food. You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. The morcilla is outstanding. My wife is Colombian and she makes this Gringo drive 75 miles for this outstanding taste of home"}
{"text":"Call this a very low, marginal four-star.  Which we could have half rating from Yelp!  Having traveled extensively in South America, one month in Colombia was an excellent experience and a better way to know the food, people and cultures of the country.  The Colombians have good reason to be proud of their country and keep asking, \"Where are the American tourists?\"  I remind them of the drug wars, which they are burying deep in their mental pasts and the conversations moves on.  My wife and I never found Colombian food to be anything special, but we were impressed with Los Paisas.  Los Paisas is how they refer to thenselves and their trademark, very traditional worker's meal is a paisa.  This is the full-court press of sausage, fried pork skin, rice, beans, fried plantain and more.  It is a feast and will last you for a day.  Try it at Los Paisas.  We were the only gringos in the place, so you know that the food is what the latinos like.  And with the servers all fluent in Spanish, Los Paisas is a comfortable place for those who do not speak English well.  Best news is that they have daily specials prices at just under $7.  Includes soup, beverage and a choice of three entrees.  An excellent way to shop through Colombian cuisine.  We had the grilled pork covered with white cream sauce,  Nice little salad with it and the lighter green plantain, which is not really green as is raw, but lighter fried.  The standard plantain is heavily fried, thicker and comes out a orange-yellow.  Wife had a salad with avacado and it was a very generous portion of both greens and avacado.  House dressing is a red wine vinaigrette made in-house.  I found it way too sweet for my taste, but my wife liked it.    Iced tea is very weak, more like tinted water.    Service was excellent.  They have skillfully used their limited space to put in a full bar and have room to dance.  Seating is available outside and is not crowded inside.  We will come back for another lunch special as we think Los Paisas has potential to be a full 4-star or a five."}
{"text":"I happened to be in Pineville one day and tried their grilled chicken lunch. Their specials come with a side salad, rice, plaintains, and a huge bowl of delicious veggie soup to complement the entree. The chicken was savory and awesomely seasoned, and every bite made me wish I lived closer to Pineville so I could become a regular.  Not much to say, everything was faultless! Great lunch specials, cheap prices, and really friendly, quick service. Convenient location too, even though it's hidden behind the Waffle House. Can't wait to come back for dinner someday and try their desserts. No doubt, this is my new favorite South American restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I have a couple complaints about this restaurant: 1- first time I found a best of hair on my dish. 2- I bough empanadas and it was a completely mess. They didn't give me any instruction.  I talked to the manager and they didn't take any responsibility."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to eat here last weekend, and thoroughly enjoyed the place.  The staff was extremely helpful and never let any drink run dry.  The food was tasty and top quality. we started off with Empanadas, which had good flavor and probably could have been plenty for two as a meal. But we didn't stop there... we also ordered a side of Yuca, which seemed a bit on the dry side, I don't believe it was an error on the cooking process but instead I don't believe the Yuca was quite ripe, even with the dryness they were great! I ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana, which honestly is enough for two people. Everything on the plate was cooked perfectly and had such great flavor. I loved the sausage and crackling. Because of the amount of food on my plate, I didn't get a chance to try any other dishes, but there were no complaints from the table.  This is definitely a top notch restaurant, not the best of locations though (it is at a location that you need to be going there to see it, its located in a corner of a shopping complex that isn't thriving anymore).  Everything said, We will definitely be visiting again for more!"}
{"text":"I got the mojarra and it was absolutely delicious--just crispy enough on the outside and tender and flaky on the inside.  A squeeze of lime made it a delicate and flavorful fish dish that was supremely pleasing to my palate.  Don't get me started about the empanadas.  Just be warned:  one is not enough, go ahead and order 30.  Adding in the milky guanabana and I needed to be rolled off the comfortable chair at the end of the meal.  I can't wait to go back and save room for dessert."}
{"text":"I have now been here twice and can confidently agree that this is fantastic Colombian food. The staff is friendly and they give you this tasty slightly spiced green sauce when you sit down. It's for empanadas, so you have to get one. (heck they're $1!!) we got that amazing combination dish you see pics of all over here, and yes it's just like that. Each part is so fresh authentic and tasty.  I got the Bistec encebollado and I will definitely get it again. Picture beautiful marinated flank steak topped with tomatoes, onions, peppers and in a yummy tomato sauce that goes fantastic with the rice. Topped with a fried egg that only compliments it. It also comes with fried plantains as a great bonus. Yes, will come back and bring friends!!"}
{"text":"Great Colombian food! Every time we come to Charlotte we will be coming back every time mark my words. Dishes are fresh and delicious. You have to get the empanadas and maduros con queso! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Three 1/2 stars.   I stopped for lunch on my way to the airport. Sunday 2:30 , this being Charlotte I figured it would be empty. WROONG. The place was packed with Latins having lunch at their  usual (Latin) time.   Service was fantastic, in spite of hustle and bustle the help made sure I got my food asap when I told them I had to go.    I ordered the Picada, way too much food and definitely heavy but very tasty. I loved the roasted casava, plantains etc. The \"red sausage\" (chorizo!) very good tasting but compared to the Argentine version it's much drier and tougher. The \"black sausage\" ( morcilla or blood pudding) has rice in it, again drier and nowhere as rich flavored as the Argentine version, but it's a Colombian restaurant so that's not a completely fair comparison. Also people who are not used to it would probably prefer the milder Colombian black sausage. I had to run and didn't have time to finish my lunch, but I'd definitely return if I'm in that area. I looked at what other people were having and all of it looked very appetizing , huge portions too. Don't go there if you're on a diet!"}
{"text":"The best part of the experience was the sever. He was great.  As for the food?  First, the menu looks more like that of a Mexican restaurant and not of a Columbian one. Secondly,  the food quality and taste was at best mediocre; however,  I did get sick approximately 12 hours later. Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Official empanadas and authentic food if your looking for a spot. This little place feels like home. Staff is polite and food is so delicious. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Excellent Colombian food in Charlotte, NC, I was glad to find a plate of rice and beans with plantains for me. The staff is friendly and make you feel welcomed the minute you walk in."}
{"text":"Everything here is good with huge portions and great service. Always happy, helpful, and attentive staff and tasty food."}
{"text":"Not enjoyable at all. Food has no flavor and extremely dry. I shouldn't have to chew so hard to break the food down before been able to swallow. Server could careless if we were there. Will not ever go back. Save your $$ and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best Colombian food in Charlotte. Hands down. The Churrasco is excellent."}
{"text":"Just went there for lunch, AMAZING daily lunch specials.  for 6.62 you get a drink, soup of the say, salad, rice, fried plantain, and featured protein.  I had grilled pork.  The sauces that accompany each dish are just as delicious as the dishes themselves.  Fresh ingredients and satisfy every taste bud!"}
{"text":"Will definitely be back! The only reason I knocked a star off is because the service was a bit slow given that the restaurant wasn't entirely busy. But the food... SO GOOD. So much flavor. So much food. I am not Colombian but I feel like it's pretty easy to tell when food is authentic or Americanized and I could definitely tell it's more on the authentic end of the spectrum. We will absolutely be back.   Give this place a try! I highly highly doubt you will regret it. Oh, and there WILL be leftovers. (They are just as good on day 2)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  Great service, food and music!!  I went on a Saturday night.  The place was busy.  However, I wouldn't know the difference because the service was exceptional!!  I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I am reluctant to give only one star seeing all the 4-5 stars on Yelp for this place which was what brought me to Los Paisas in the first place. My husband, son and I went Sunday 2pm. The place was packed and we had a short wait. We were very excited to see the place packed translating to a good restaurant and seeing the food being served to other patrons looked delicious. Unfortunately, my $15.99 seafood bouillabaise was terrible because it had 2 small/medium size shrimps, 4 frozen (not fresh) mussels, 2 tiny pieces of fish, 2 small rings (size of nickel and dime) of calamari, 3 crab legs the length and width of my fingers that was fully intacted in the shell (with no means of cracking the legs open). It came in a deceiving big bowl only to have me fish around in the sauce for the seafood. Why do they even bother having this on the menu only to serve frozen mussels and teeny tiny seafood? My husband ordered a cup of coffee which was luke warm he says. He hailed the waiter over and the waiter did remedy this by getting my husband a hotter cup of coffee. I was also excited to try the crispy pork from my husband's plate only to find it really hard to chew. Way over cooked/fried. The place was packed with Colombians so I would think its authentic and good. Don't go by my 1 star and not try this place, just don't order the seafood bouillibaise. Or maybe they just want to serve to Colombians? I'm fine with that. Its too bad we didn't have a good experience cause we are the type that would patronize a restaurant every week if we love it. Other restaurants would be glad to take my money once a week I'm sure."}
{"text":"Ay dios mio!! (Oh my God)   Took a bit of a drive to get here  & I am so glad the hour + drive was so worth it! It's been a while since I've had some Colombian food.   They had a live band the night I went. Loved it. The place is on the small side and it was for sure a full house! Crowded near the door.   We had the meat empanadas to start ! Straight perfection. Perfectly crispy! Gone in two seconds.   I had a guanabana shake ....again perfect my little sister gave me a sip of her mango shake you guessed it perfect!   I had the Columbian platter has tons of stuff rice, beans, meat, sausage, plantains, a fried egg, fresh chicharones ( I think it's pork skin) & an arepa. Everything was as expected wonderful. There's a hot sauce I had that was awesome too. It's one of the three they have. I didn't look at the other two so I can't explain, but it was so good even took some home.   My son wanted tostones (fried green plantains) he topped them with salsa roja (red sauce) red sauces is something you need to experience it's just so amazing!   This place was awesome I will for sure be going back."}
{"text":"This is a MUST DO restaurant. The freshness of the food is evident from appetizers thru the main meals. Staff was attentive and super friendly. The flavors are amazing and not too over-powering. We had pork, steaks, and lots of great veggie dishes. Enjoyed the futbol on TV, too!"}
{"text":"The empanadas and margaritas were a great way to start followed by the massive meal for two with a little bit of everything was phenomenal.  My wife and I ate as much as we desired and there was still enough meat and veggies left for a yummy omelet with leftovers.  This place is a main stay and will always be my \"go to\" when I am in Pineville area."}
{"text":"My wife is from Brazil and there are not any home cooking style Brazilian restaurants in Charlotte or surrounding, so we tend to eat a lot of food from Central to South America instead. We have been to some really good ones, but Los Paisas is the bar. We have been to 4 Columbian restaurants specifically and none of them really compare.   The flavor, the value, the service, it's all there. I always get the Bandeja Tipica Columbiana. It has the best bang for the buck for me. It's so much food, I always have enough for another meal later. It comes with grilled beef, beans, sausage (which is the best I've had), pork crackling, rice, egg, plantains (which I swap for Yuca), avocado and white corn tortilla. Even just saying all of that is a mouth full.  The first thing we do when we are seated is order some beef empanadas. You'd think that if you've had empanadas before then you already know what to expect, but that's far from the truth. I've had my fair share of empanadas in my life and I can't even compare them, as they are in a league of their own.   Bring your appetite, bring your wallet and bring a blanket (for the nap after, since you'll be in a food coma)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and truly authentic!!! I'm Colombian and from NY. I tried this on my visit to Charlotte and I'm so happy I found this gem. The bandeja paisa and empanadas were amazing and honestly better than the Colombian restaurants in NY by me! It really isn't fair! Service was awesome too! Very sweet and welcoming staff. I just loved everything!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. Everything we ordered was perfect! Delicious! Great service. The restaurant was packed but since it was just my husband and I we were seated immediately. The server was a little lost at first but he then warmed up and was very friendly and very attentive. We had a few empanadas and they were very good. I ordered the Mojarra Frita and the only thing I would recommend is to add beans with it since just plain white rice would be a little dry but my husband shared some of his. My husband ordered the Bandeja Típica Colombiana. He loved it. It's so big he couldn't finish it. I believe next time we will share that. The prices are excellent considering they serve so much food. We had Maracuya and Guanabana smoothies. We couldn't order dessert since we were so full. We will next time. We will be back soon. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Tried Los Paisas this weekend - we were seated quickly and our waitress came right over. They had $3.99 Mojitos and Margaritas, so we tried both. They were good - and good-sized! It is in a strip mall, but the inside is clean and not cluttered. Lots of tables that aren't on top of each other.   We ordered the GIANT combination plate (Paradilla) - it had grilled chicken, steak, pork, 2 kinds of sausage, plantains and a large side of white rice. There were 3 kinds of sauce on the table, I liked the bright green one best and used it on all the meats - tasted fresh and a little spicy. The combo was $23, so a really good deal for the massive amount of food. We didn't take leftovers but you could easily make 2 meals out of it.  It was a fun experience - not your run of the mill restaurant. They even had live music! Check it out if you want a getaway from your average night out!"}
{"text":"Ate there twice in one week it is a wonderful place to go and the food is excellent. If you're looking for something different that is a place to check out. I tried to go there as often as I can. They always have wonderful lunch specials. The staff there is wonderful and the owners are even better."}
{"text":"1st time ...it was delicious! great service to! thank you to our server Diego!!!! I will be back!!!!! compliment I!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. My wife is from Bogota and she loves the food we got at this establishment. We started with several empanadas which were the best we've had outside of Colombia. We then got the Picada dish which came with steak, chicken, two types of sausage and fried plantains. Delicious and very filling. I would recommend this as a great date night or celebration spot."}
{"text":"On the penultimate eve of my final day in Charlotte (I'm moving to NYC), I do believe that I just had one of the best meals of my life.   Los Paisas is a Colombian restaurant that serves amazing food, has great prices, and the best service.  First up, the margarita was huge and strong! The empanadas that they give you a la nachos and salsa at a Mexican restaurant, had so much flavor! If I had known, I would've ordered them as a full appetizer.  Boy were they amazing!  For the entree, I had the Bandejas Tipica Colombiana, which is the combo plater that has the works: fatty deep-fried pork, grilled steak, rice and beans, fried egg, avocado, sausage. The steak was a particular flavor standout. I had the identical dish at Pio Pio a few weeks ago, but the one here was a hundred times better.  Los Paisas also gives you 3 dipping sauces to accompany your meal.  All 3 are green and are equally delicious, though the one with olive oil was my favorite.  The service was authentically friendly and professional.  Such warm people!  I absolutely love this place, and am disappointed I only discovered it now.  This place rocks!!  (Update: I came back the following day for lunch, because the food was so good.  For lunch, I had a mojito, and chicken with mustard mushroom cream sauce.  It was really good, as it came with rice and plantains (requested).  I love this restaurant!)"}
{"text":"I have yet to eat my main course, however the complimentary empanada I got cause the waitress likes my personality was amazing. And at $3 I am definitely having to remind myself to slow down on my guayaba con leche.  I got my meal, the bistec empo..... I don't know. But it's amazing.  So much food and it's all good. Foodgasmly delicious. Get it with the eggs on top."}
{"text":"HOLY HEARTATTACK ..!!! I was in the area and stopped here for lunch the other day.  After quickly looking at the menu I knew that was getting - The Bandeja.  It was my go to dish at my favorite Columbian joint up in NYC.  This dish is enough to fee two people!! You get rice, beans, steak, sausage, pork belly, a fried egg, avocado, sweet plantains and a thick white tortilla. I can't begin to descried how delicious every single bite was. I almost didn't make it back to work as my food coma started to kick in.  The entire staff was extremely friendly and welcoming which made me feel more comfortable as I was probably the only non-Hispanic person there. I sat at the bar so I could watch a soccer game on tv. The owner/manager himself came out and spoke to me for a bit. He even checked back in a few times to make sure I was doing ok. Overall, I had a great experience and I will recommend this place to anyone looking for good Columbian food. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great spot! Tucked away in a blasé strip mall, Los paisas was a hit. Waiter was smooth and super pleasant. Place was clean and had a great vibe. Food was really good. Wife had the arroz con pollo and I had steak. Homemade sauces were tasty. All around pleasant experience. Oh and I also indulged in a delish tres leche cake which was homemade."}
{"text":"I travel to NY, San Fran, LA and Houston and this is the best Columbian food I've found ( no offense but who would really expect that in a Suburb of Charlotte). Got the chicken with a mustard like cream sauce on it. Fantastic!  Fried cheesecake....amazing!  Sour sop juice to drink....heaven. Just go there and you will write a review like this as well."}
{"text":"Delicious food and warm, friendly atmosphere.  Highly recommend and looking forward to my next meal here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the back of the mall next to wal-mart. It is a small restaurant with less than 100 seats but the restaurant has tasty food.   We ordered some empanadas for apps and it was very good. Crunchy shell with very soft insides.   We ordered the house combo meal for the mains, which has grilled beef, sausage, beans, rice, plantains, and pork belly ( a must have)   I will definitely be back for more. Needless to say I was super full after eating all that food for $15.00 A great deal!!"}
{"text":"I heard such great things about Los Paisas that I had to give it a try.    It sits in the corner of the McMullen Creek Shopping Center and it could be easily missed.  I entered and despite being really busy, I was greeted immediately.    The service is what stood out here.  The servers realized I was new and went out of their way to let me try and empanada with the various sauces.  I wanted something authentic so not knowing it was the biggest thing on the menu, I ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana.  The beef was good especially with the chimichurri sauce added.  The sausage was my favorite.  I didn't care for the pork crackling, the tortilla or the rice but I'm not a big rice eater (read my Asian reviews).  Everything else was wonderful.    But next time I don't think I'll order the largest plate on the menu."}
{"text":"Best Colombian/South American food I've found in Charlotte, and I've tried a LOT of them.  Bandeja Paisa - the flagship dish - is huge, not too expensive, and yes, it puts you into a food coma.  Drink selection is great too, big old cup of concentrated exotic fruit juice mixed with water.  Staff usually can deal with spanish or english.  Service is very fast unless they are completely full.  Outside seating for overflow is nice.    Their fried yuca plate is really too small, I'd rather fry it at home at the price, but that's about the only negative I can find.  Stop in, order something, and enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm! Authentic and delicious. Great staff. Quick, reasonable price. Had the empanadas which were lovely. Then the shrimp and rice, chicken and rice ... yummmm. Get the vinaigrette with the salad, it's homemade and wonderful."}
{"text":"Want to eat so much food you splode (explode)?  If so this is the place.  I drive from North East Charlotte for over 30 minutes to get here.  Think of how many places you would drive that far out of your way to eat at.  You should eat here and see why it is worth the drive.  I always go here with my Colombian house guest who happens to be married to my uncle.  What I love about this place: 1) Meat/Res (especially beef/carne); 2) The hot soups; 3) The sausage (red, not the black so much); 4) Volume of food you get for your order; 5) The rose colored mayonnaise sauce.  My wife loves this place, heck everyone I take here loves this place.  This is not a big place, they will accommodate your group but there are only 20 or so tables.  The place is packed and half the time I come here I have to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated.  I come here with 4-7 people and it is usually the more than 4 people that lead to the longer wait times.  The staff are very friendly, speaking both Spanish and English.  Don't tell Wifey, but some very fit people come and eat here."}
{"text":"Looks like I am one of the only ones who wasn't very impressed. Maybe I need to go back again and get something different?  We went for lunch and I was pretty excited after reading the reviews. The inside is clean and quaint. It is located in a shopping center (a little tough to find) but it is tucked in to the right of Staples.  We split two beef empanadas and the Bandeja Paisa which includes a mixture of egg, steak, sausage, an avocado cut in half, a sweet plantain, beans and rice. I really enjoyed the plantain but the rest was lacking a bit of flavor and wasn't very hot temperature-wise. I liked the steak once I added some of the side sauces to them but my chimichuri-loving husband said he thought it tasted jarred to him.   Most dishes minus the lunch specials (4 which change daily) were about $12 for lunch. That is a little steep for me , the dishes are definitely shareable which is nice but it limited us to ordering what the other person would want too. For the price I just didn't feel like the meal lived up to some other $12 lunches I have enjoyed."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why I have only been here twice in nine years.  The lunch specials are very affordable and they certainly are not shy on the amount of food they serve!   The chicken with mushroom sauce was very juicy and plentiful along with the rice and plantain. This definitely makes me a big fan of Colombian cuisine!  I can't wait to make it back."}
{"text":"I'm from Medellín, Colombia and the food was just like back home. Feels good to have a little taste of home! Staff super nice, we had to change seats for a bigger group of people, no problem with us but they still gave us free empanadas for the bother (not a problem with me lol) I got carne Asada and my husband got the Bandeja paisa. If you are hungry, get that! The establishment was very neat nice and the staff looked great,the Manager also stopped by to make sure we liked everything. Like a good ol \"Paisa\" (country person from Medellín Colombia)."}
{"text":"Glad I finally decided to try Colombian cuisine. As you can see from the pictures, they give you a lot, so recommended you come hungry. The skirt steak was quite generous as well as the fried plantains. Food quality was terrific and a great value. I also got a smoothie (dairy-based) which was served in a very tall glass - can't remember the name of the fruit but it was awesome. For those looking for something different and affordable, I recommend Los Paisas and look forward to returning to try some of their seafood."}
{"text":"Love their empanadas! So crunchy and tasty. Their fresh juice is great too! Service was good, food was good and I will def be back."}
{"text":"The service is horrible!!! Never again... I ordered food for my company potluck online and then confirmed order over the phone. When I arrived the quantity was wrong and they treated me like crap. Not going back :("}
{"text":"We went in at 7 on a weeknight. It wasn't crowded but the section we were seated was almost full. By 745 though, it pretty much had cleared out.  We were greeted warmly when we arrived and our server was very pleasant.  I ordered the trout - it was so good! It has braised onions and mushrooms in a delicious and not heavy sauce. If you are a fish lover as I am, you won't be disappointed. It came with tostones (fried green plantains), but unfortunately they were hard and dry with little flavor- I was disappointed as I was looking forward to them. Rice and salad was part of the entree as well and both forgettable.  My friend had the pechuga de pollo (chicken breast) in a mustard sauce. Sounds strange but it worked. The chicken was tender and the sauce an interesting change from normal fare. Both entrees were large portions. There was just about something for anyone on the menu. Seriously, if the tostones hadn't been so bad this could have been a 5 star experience.  The ladies room was clean, and every person I saw friendly and welcoming. Casual attire.  I totally would recommend"}
{"text":"Las empanadas, que parecían bastante buenas no lo estuvieron. Ordenamos una picada, que alcanza fácilmente para dos personas pero ni el patacón ni la carne (60% del plato) tenía buen sabor ni textura."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The milanesa de pollo is sooooo good!!! The service is great!! And the waiters are super nice. Can't wait to come back soon!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The Bandeja Paisa is fantastic if you are in the mood for meat. The Cazuela de Mariscos will cure your seafood cravings for sure! Don't miss this little restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate there and was not very impressed. The food did not meet my expectations whatsoever and was rather dissatisfied.  My mojarra frita was cooked good but the plantains were stiff and tasteless, moreover the mojito was bland, weak, and tasted like a frozen mix, nothing fresh.  My stepdad got the cocktail de camarones and was very disappointed.  It was like a like luke-warm bloodymary mix with tasteless shrimp.  I am a big fan of south American food, Cuban food, and anything worldy, so I'm fine with eating a fish w/ a head on the plate.  Everything there besides the table salsas was rather bland. The service was actually quite good though, and they gave us free empanadas since it was our first time there.  I gave it a try..."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!  We have driven by a few times and finally decided to stop. It was phenomenal.  The serve and food was excellent. We don't speak Spanish and are not that familar with Columbian food, but we love everything!"}
{"text":"I think this place may have changed ownership since some of the reviews were posted. The name has changed as noted in another review. The food was fair, but nothing to write home about. The pork was good, but a bit overcooked. The biggest disappointment was the tostones (fried green plantain) they were dry and tasteless and if I had to guess they were reheated from the day before, blah! I have no Latin American background, but even I can cook better at home. The beans and rice were good as were the variety of homemade sauces (chimichurri and salsa tomatillo) they bring to the table. The servers were polite and they were quick but I wouldn't go for a second visit."}
{"text":"I swear the Queen City has all the goof stuff! I live in Raleigh and visit CLT often since we have family here. I often regret not relocating in CLT instead of the Capitol city. ~sigh~  This place is wonderful, they accommodated our big family nicely. Service was wonderful! Very kind and patient.  We started with Empanadas! Nice size and they actually had meat in them! Score! We had Bandejas Paisas, Sobre Barriga Criolla...they were all winners! We all fell into a food coma on our drive home! Will fore sure be back!"}
{"text":"Good service, food, and aguas de mango. Ordered bistec encebollado and I love the sauce that comes with the steak. Empanadas were not that impressive"}
{"text":"I has a plate of  braised beef tongue slices, yucca, rice, beans, and plantains. It was more than enough food and everything was delicious. If this is your first time eating beef tongue, I'd pass and try it on a mexican street taco first. The larger slices and stronger beef flavor may be a bit off-putting to first time eaters here.Tongue is the essence of beef... you must try it at some point. :-) The service and staff were superb."}
{"text":"My meal did not compare to others glowing reviews...food was cold--not close to proper temp.  Pork special was tough as leather.  Soup, which which was part of the meal was \"vegetable\" today & was cold & basically chicken broth w/veg all.  I ate very little  of my food, including the soup.  Yet I was charged for the soup & the beverage, both of which were to have been included in my meal.  Not sure I'll go back...for the $$ I spent, I could have gone to Subway next door...at least I would have been full for the same amount of $$."}
{"text":"Delicious Columbian Cuisine !! 5 stars !! Food is Amazing & Service was Amazing !! Went here for the first time & will Definitely be going back and also bringing friends and family and telling everyone about it !!   The service was the Nicest and FASTEST I have ever experienced and was Not rushed at all while enjoying my meal !! The food was Incredibly Delicious and I did order a Drink from the Bar and it was Top shelf and Great...I highly recommend eating here and Hope you have the same experience as I did !!!"}
{"text":"Our server jalil was fantastic! myself and another customer was vegan and he was very knowledgeable about items that were fried in the same oil as the meats so we were very appreciative of that! We got one of the salads minus the chicken and cheese and added a side of rice with avocado. We were not able to get the frijoles because they were cooked in chicken stock and he was honest about it! I Wish they had a negro frijoles cooked in vegetable broth or just another option of beans for non meat eaters. Otherwise the food was great and the food was delicious, def will come back"}
{"text":"First time having Columbian food. This place is packed, and now I know why. Food was great, service was fast, and they gave us a free appetizer since it was our first time visiting."}
{"text":"This place is a 30min drive on the interstate but it's worth it. My favorite dish is \"la bandeja paisa\" for $13 you're getting a lot of food ! The food is just delicious. Has a lot of flavor. The atmosphere is nice. Drinks are a little price here though. Other than that, this place is great"}
{"text":"The server, Diego, completely forgot to put in my order. He tried to play it off by bringing my salad after everyone else in my party had gotten their entrees. When my food was served, I didn't get my plantains. They brought them out a little bit after. Nothing was said to me. There was no apology. The food is overpriced too. The only good thing for this experience was that empanadas were good."}
{"text":"There are not many Colombian restaurants in Charlotte. I was born and raised in Colombia so I crave the authentic meals all the time. This place takes me back to Colombia every time. They're also very clean, friendly staff and have happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Just left this spot for lunch... all I can say is... I'm in a food coma. Can't believe I ate so much. Someone probably should've taken my food away from me. Empanadas are delicious. Their chicharron appetizer was so good. They were busy when get to the restaurant. To my surprise our food and the service was still great for being busy."}
{"text":"Great place and extremely friendly staff. I was next door getting a picture framed and a lady told I could go get something to drink while I waitied. The Colombians that work there a authentic paisas, not from medellin but close enough. the empanadas with aji reminded me of bogota as well as the jugo lulo!"}
{"text":"I decided to get the bandeja. What a disappointment. I requested the ground beef and got the steak. The meat was tough and over cooked. The pork time was undercooked. If you are planning on getting something to go. Check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time. It's a game night (soccer) between Brazil and Colombia so naturally a lot of game spirit here since it's a Colombian restaurant.   Food was plenty and tastes good...a couple of folks food in our group had a salty food but they swapped it.  Drink are also very good. We had a a couple of margarita pitchers and shared between all of us (6 people)  Gave us empanadas and a few sauces/dips and those were good too.   Will return soon for more good food."}
{"text":"Perfección!  Bandeja paisa es rica y muy grande. Tostones con guacamole son terríficos!   Perfection!  The bandeja paise is delicious and very big. The fried green plantain with guacamole are amazing. And the people are wonderful. La gente son muy amables."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere aee very authentic. The service was exceptional and the food most importantly was amazing. Great Place!"}
{"text":"I can only review the lunch, since I live an hour away so its the only time I come. But the lunch is AWESOME! They have the best specials for low prices. Their fried chicken is better than some soul food restaurants! But that RICE!!! I come for the RICE!! You don't need to add salt, you don't need to add butter. Just perfectly cooked rice. I also love the Empanadas!! Oh and their homemade Tartar sauce for the fish special is the best Tartar Sauce i've ever had. I wish I could order some to take home. I've had friends who have ordered off the regular menu during lunch and they are never disappointed. The service is decent, but it could be better. Its not so bad that it alters my opinion of the place though. I definitely visit at least once a week."}
{"text":"After reading the numerous good reviews, I had to find out for myself. My wife and I drove out to the Mathew-Pineville area which is a 28 minute drive.   Once we arrived, the restaurant appeared to be busy and very chaotic. We made our way in and were not greet due to the busy nature of the restaurant. After a 5 to 8 min wait I had to ask if we could even get a seat. We finally got acknowledged and were told to wait for 10-15 mins. I believe this was the one big negatives that kept it from getting 5 star review. The hostess and everyone seemed to not want to acknowledge or ask if we needed help.   After finally getting in, we dive into the good stuff. The food was exceptional from the beginning to the end. Being Colombian, my standard were set pretty high. The appetizers empanadas and arenas con chicharrones were fresh. They were not greasy or stale. The empanadas picadillo had the perfect balance between spicy and flavorful.   Our entrees were no less than spectacular, my wife ordered chicken and mushrooms which he described as heavenly. The rice and plantains were cooked perfectly.  I ordered the bandeja tipica which is our traditional dish in Colombia. Again everything was prepared perfectly and the dish was not overwhelming in season or grease. This dish is probably one of the hardest to balance due to the huge amount of food and fat but this was done perfectly. The only thing that got over cooked was the chicharrones and it was missing the arepa.   After stuffing our faces we still made room to order flan which was great. Not much of a desert person myself but my wife loved it.   Our waiter was good and quick which helped a bit since our greet was terrible. The only suggestion to improve is in the greeting and make a investment in high chairs since ours did not work."}
{"text":"Pretty good Colombian (at least the best I've found so far in Charlotte). Service is excellent, everyone is very friendly and attentive. Try their seafood rice - very good. I am kind of surprised at their somewhat high prices for some of the dishes (at least compared to the big city I come from). Also, I wish they had soup options throughout the ENTIRE day not just for lunch. Their tres leches dessert is to DIE FOR!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in there after the supermarket thinking it was Mexican food lol.  Glad it was something different!  I had the House Favorite chicken with mushroom sauce and he had the lunch special chicken in curry sauce.  It was dynamite!  Service was so good I couldn't tell who was our waiter we had like 4 or 5 come by.  We will definitely be back!"}
