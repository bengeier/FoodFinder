{"text":"This small but comfortable neighborhood eatery is truly a neighborhood eatery -- when my husband and I went to T & K's for lunch, nearly everyone there seemed to know each other, and in a couple of instances, be related to each other. 

T & K's has 3 separate hand-written menus on the wall, which I suppose could be considered breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We came in around 2 p.m., and were the only patrons not eating one of the $5 breakfast specials. (We'll have to come back for one of those!) Instead, we ordered off the dinner menu.

Since doing so was pricey, we opted to share one dinner. The woman who took our order was happy to honor this request.

Dinners are your choice of meat or fish, with two sides. We chose the ribs with greens and macaroni and cheese. 

Probably since we ordered dinner at lunch (or breakfast) time, our meal had to be prepared from scratch. The downside to this, of course, was that this was not fast food. But the upside? This was not fast food! It came out piping hot and fresh, with the server (who was the same woman who took our order) announcing, \"Worth the wait\" as she placed our plates in front of us. I admired her confidence in not ending her sentence with a question mark.

Oh, and notice I said two plates. Splitting an entr√©e doesn't always mean it will arrive on two plates. But it did, and still in hearty enough portions -- two large ribs smothered in BBQ sauce, and two ample, though not monster-sized portions of greens and mac n cheese. 

Speaking of BBQ sauce, the server/counter-person came to our table before our food was ready to ask if we'd like the regular or the hot sauce. \"How hot?\" I asked, and she shouted back to the cook (who works right behind the counter), \"How hot?\" and he immediately shouted back, \"HOT.\" Sooo ... we went with the regular,

Wise choice, as it was delicious. And still a bit spicy, but in a non-painful way. The ribs themselves were  the least thrilling part of the meal, but they did the trick. The mac n cheese was very, very home-cooking-style (meant as a compliment) and the greens were OUTSTANDING.

Our lunch came to $16, which include two cans of soda--err--pop (as it's called here in the 'burgh). Speaking of pop, my husband enjoyed a delightfully offensive Cherikee Red, complete with Indian chief graphic (a product that google tells me is made in Cleveland and is primarily available in OH and PA), and I washed it all down with a Tahitian Treat (carbonated fruit punch).

My only suggestion for the fine folks at T & K's would be to turn off the TV! But I get that there is this unwritten law that 90% of all Pittsburgh restaurants must feature a flat-screen TV (ideally showing sporting events). 

Anyway, if you love soul food, and aren't in a huge hurry, head over to T & K's!"}
{"text":"I had a cheesesteak sandwich here and it was soooooooo good. The place is small, the menu is hand-written and I felt a little awkward but it was totally worth it. They also have an impressive selection of pies (!) which I didn't have enough cash to try :( The sandwich was HUGE, impossible to eat without getting down and dirty in it, overflowing with green and banana peppers and mushrooms and grilled onions and cheese. Their fries are also great - they're the thick, steak kind."}
{"text":"I had pretty much the same experience as a previous reviewer.

Rib dinner with greens and mac-n-cheese for sides. The ribs were lukewarm and came with choice of BBQ sauces. I had the hot which hinted of tabasco. I liked the sides much more than the ribs. Everything was authentic southern comfort food.

Service was friendly and good. Cash only establishment. The plate was $13 and tax which I guess is par given their size, but a bit pricey compared to TX and Seattle albeit much larger establishments."}
{"text":"This place was a perfect late night eat before a night full of fun.  I needed some greasy delicious food before I started my night and Oakland, and T & K supplied it.  The wings I ordered were whole jumbo wings, and they were a great price.  For 7 bucks, I got a half dozen whole wings that were freshly fried right before my eyes.

I still cannot decide what was better, the coleslaw, the wings, or the owner's genuinely kind personality."}
{"text":"In my sizable experience, the worse a hole in the wall a BBQ Pit is, the more finger lickingly delicious their food is.  T & K's is no exception.  The decor, atmosphere and service are not going to win any awards, but the soul food is as good as it gets.  the prices are extremely reasonable, it was $10 for my meal and they gave me a ton of ribs.  I got the pork ribs with 1/2 honey mustard sauce and 1/2 hot sauce, and a side of mashed potatoes and greens.  The sides were savory, rich and fresh, and the ribs were some of the best I've ever had.  I'd go back in a heart beat, but plan on getting the food and taking it to go for a summer picnic dinner!"}
{"text":"The beauty of walking is you get to see all the small hole-in-the-wall joints you typically miss if you're driving around.

T & K's Soul Food does both take out as well as dine in; most people tend to get their food to go.  My friend and I both ordered their rib dinner which consists of 4 rib bones, 2 sides and cornbread.  I chose mac 'n cheese and collard greens for my sides and my buddy got mac 'n cheese and mashed potatoes.

Ribs were super super super meaty and tender.  They were lukewarm, which shows they were cooked ahead of time, but ribs do take time to cook.  I would've preferred them piping hot though.  Mac 'n cheese was super super super good.  I love mac 'n cheese and I mean the real thing; sorry Kraft.  The collard greens were pretty standard; not amazing but not bad.

For 12 bucks it's definitely a pretty sweet deal.  For me it's 3.5 stars and I'll definitely be back to try their fried chicken."}
