The burger is pretty good, but I found it a bit too greasy (there's a pool of oil on the bottom of the paper wrapper when I finished the burger)
The burger is juicy and tender, to the point that the patty was falling apart in my hands.
In comparison, I find Slab burger more satisfying and Holy Chuck's burger more tasty."}
{"text":"Popped in here one evening for a quick bite on my way home. I ordered the AK Veggie 7. Guac is standard on this burger, which is a nice touch. Other than that though, it was pretty lack-lustre. Boring bun, standard-type soy patty, and exactly one leaf of iceberg lettuce, one sad tomato round, and a floppy pickle. The fries were good though.

I would eat here in a pinch, and I can't speak for their meat products, but I would never go here intentionally for the veggie burger."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, it's such a convenient location. Menu items are fresh and offer lots of diversity, not just your regular burger! All the staff are really friendly and I love the atmosphere -- cute \"chalkboard\" walls and window seats available. Great place to catch up with friends, have a low-key date night, or with family. The prices are definitely reasonable, compared to other places and also considering how fresh the ingredients are."}
{"text":"The dynamics: 
Beautiful location right in the busy streets of Kensington Market. 
The people: 
Friendly staff but I can't help but notice they seem overworked. Lovely people though. The woman who took my order was quick to remedy the situation when they made my burger wrong. Lots of young people and business-types frequent this place for a quick lunch. 

The burger: YES. The burger is heaven. The bread reminds me of In N Out, if a little better. Their burgers are nice and juicy. I tried the Sergeant and I liked it.

The actual place: Decent design but I CANNOT review this place without commenting on the fact that it is not well kept. The tables all need cleaning. I was a little grossed out to even sit down. After trying to suck it up, I saw that the chair had spilled liquid on it (juice or pop). This place urgently needs someone just to make sure it's clean because the table spaces are obviously used for, well, eating. 

Also, I love that this place is an undercover \"all-halal\" burger restaurant! 

All in all, if you're ever wanting a quick burger and you're close by to Kensington, don't miss out on this burger place!!"}
{"text":"We got 2 commander burgers and a rocket fries as well as a pop. The burgers were an affordable $6.00 and had plenty of meat, so I'd call it a bargain. The rocket fries were definitely the best part though, never had fries that good before, but then again we've only eaten at fast food places. The fries were a little too small for the money as well. I would recommend you take the homemade combo fries with the burger if you want a drink, since $1.50 for a pop is, while not uncommon a price for soft drinks downtown, also definitely not a deal. Overall service was friendly and a tad slow, nothing atypical of food places downtown. It was great, and we'll probably come back to take the burgerinator challenge!"}
{"text":"i'll cut to the chase here-
burgers aren't amazing but not bad either.  we ordered a sergeant burger, a battlefields burger and vanilla milkshake 

pros: 
- the vanilla milkshake was so good.  thick and extremely creamy, it also had a foam layer on the top which added a lightness to the otherwise heavy drink 
- they really don't skimp on the cheese for the battlefields burger!  every bite oozed with melted cheese 
- meat patty was very very juicy! 

cons: 
- they forgot the top of my burger bun for the sergeant burger which i had to request for  (and I paid them 15% tip as well for barely any service that was given?!) 
- although the sergeant burger is supposed to be smaller (4 oz) compared to their other burgers (6 oz); my meat patty was so overwhelmed by the amount of bread present that i ended up only eating the bottom half to get the right bun: meat ratio (so i guess i didn't need the top bun anyways) 
- meat patty lacked the grilled flavour I would like from a burger .... also I usually like my patties a bit more rare rather than fully cooked.  (but i guess if they cannot do that either its down to the chef's ability or the quality of meat that is provided) 

would i go back? hmmm maybe to give the 6 oz burgers a try- but it would not be top on my priority list."}
{"text":"Let's just say the Governator would have been proud of this joint. Amazing, juicy burger, with very creative toppings. Every day there's a special burger, which you can't go wrong with. The patty is delicious, never frozen, made from chuck beef. Very casual, unpretentious atmosphere.

If you're working on a strong single ab regiment, this place will help you get to the elusive uni-ab that Arnold wanted but never had."}
{"text":"The burger itself is good and that's the most important thing.another very good item is the onion ring and the sweet potato fries are pretty good if you like that sort of thing 

But be warned.  The floors are greasy and the bathroom is just short of disgusting"}
{"text":"The wait was long, but totally worth it. Ordered the Burgernator and it was massive. Had it for leftovers the next day. 

The burger was succulent and perfectly cooked. I got the poutine as well and it was great. 

Needless to say, I couldn't move after that meal."}
{"text":"Tried The burgernator for the first time, hands down , best burgers in the City !!! Highly recommended ."}
{"text":"I tried the big bang burger. Chicken strips, beef burger, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, fresh brioche bun. I give it a 10/10 for cook and freshness. 8/10 What I would change .... A little more garlic in the garlic sauce. Remove lettuce and tomato. Add flavour to the beef patties. Give the people the option of choosing a patty cooked with green onion and flavours or plain. Just remember there is a market for you to experimemt with full flavoured patties. I liked my burger and would recommend this place.  Everything is made fresh including the fries so an A+."}
{"text":"Loved the burgers. Super juicy and really tasty. The cheshire is a really friendly guy. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend last week for lunch. There was no line-up and we only had to wait about 10 minutes for our burgers. We both ordered the sergeant burger. I thought my burger was nice, but I wasn't a big fan of the Burgernator sauce, which kind of tasted like mayo (not quite sure exactly what's in it). They put a lot of sauce on it so if you don't like a lot of sauce make sure to order the burger without it! The bun was super nice and sweet, thought I thought the patty was a bit small for the bun. All-in-all it tasted delicious and I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"It seem like \"The Bugernator\" has lost its touch. The beef patties were over salted and falling apart.  The poutine was not even done right (cheese curds not even melted by the gravy). Also I found an onion ring in my fries. Over priced burgers for a mediocre presentation and taste.  The selection for combos aren't available anymore or the menu option has changed. It felt overpriced because the meal and the presentation was poor.  Mind you, my first and second time there were a blast. Hence, the two star rating."}
{"text":"This place was a chance visit that I randomly came across whilst walking down Augusta street in Kensington market. The atmosphere in my opinion is dark so that takes some getting used to. You order at the counter and then the order comes to your table. My friend ordered the bazooka burger and I tried the basic double patty burger. The food came quite promptly and you pick out your own ketchup and mustard. The sandwich was arranged well and honestly, the meat was cooked really well with juices coming out of it in a manageable manner. The meat is what makes this place special and the quality of the meat was high. Soft yet well cooked, tender yet hard, chewy yet not to the point where it becomes unenjoyable. We both liked the burger and while it's more or less on par with prices at The Works, there seems to be a higher care in preparation here. 

I'll go again, because I hear the big Bang burger is supposed to be good.

The reason I give each a 4 is due to the venue not being super ideal. The atmosphere is dark and the washroom facilities are not great. These things interfere with the overall experience. I think that when you go into a restaurant, the upkeep and state of the restaurant is almost as important as the food quality."}
{"text":"Burgers here were amazing. Chill atmosphere and well priced. I want to go back so bad!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty great! 

Food is tasty, and has really nice presentation. Would recommend the plain burger with jalape√±os ($ 6) instead of trying to wrestle with the complicated names and associated laundry list of ingredients."}
{"text":"I walked in here late Easter sunday morning...... and tried the bog standard Sergeant burger. 4oz patty lettuce and tom.
Lo and behold I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. A very tasty burger for $5 !!!  
Is that great value or what ????"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!! seriously waaaay better than Burger's priest which is according to blogTo number one! 
Place is runned by awesome married couple. In those burgers you can feel the love!! :)"}
{"text":"Went on the weekend. Ordered the Big Bang with fries. Got violently ill.... Never going there again"}
{"text":"Interesting black walls with a story of burgernator and the menu
Kind of dark inside
But what you go there for are the burgers which are SOOOO Good :)
Loved the Burgernator and Drop down and give me spicy
The service was decent, brought the food to my table
There was a line of 5-6 people with the place pretty full at lunch but the food was in my mouth in less than 10 mins
Will return again"}
{"text":"love this place. happened upon it a couple weeks after opening while strolling, startving, through Kensington. 

The burgers were delicious (deep fried cheese!!) and i loved the open kitchen. we were given samples of the various aiolis too, which was cool. we will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I'm pretty shocked at the amount of pleasant reviews for this place. I went in excited and expecting amazing  burgers -- given the reviews and interesting toppings offered. I visited today and now I'm laying in bed feeling queasy and hoping that I'm not about to experience a bout of food poisoning. 

I had the Atomic Burger. I found the burger to be bland. No flavours stood out at all. The patty itself fell apart, was dry and tasteless. The bun was yellow which you think would indicate that there'd be an interesting flavour, but it was dry and bland. There was supposedly sauce on my burger, but I couldn't taste it. 

It's an extremely subpar burger for the price and there are many other better and cheaper options in the area. I would have given one star, but the fries and (microscopic) portion of aioli were actually decent."}
{"text":"Simply the best burgers in Toronto. A big bang with poutine side is a meal made for kings."}
{"text":"Favorite burger joint in Toronto! Super tasty and very juicy!! Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The food here is super fresh and delicious, and the staff are always great to chat with. I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Great new spot! Located in the heart of Kensington Market, this place is quite easy to get to too via TTC. I went with a group of friends and we all tried something different, and no one was disappointed. Personally, I had the chicken burger (cutely name hasta la vista birdie). Comes with homemade guacamole and  aioli (mmm!) on it. And not only was the food good, the atmosphere was laid-back and fun. And the music was great! Definitely somewhere I will be returning to soon."}
{"text":"Their special Burger of the week (pico do gallo) did not blow my mind but decor was great and service decent. I've had better patties in Toronto but will have to visit again to get a better idea of what there regular fare has to offer."}
{"text":"This place is SO good. We ended up here because the restaurant we had planned on going to was closed, and I am so grateful. The burgers here are wonderful, juicy burger goodness. Their aioli is fantastic and the fries are decent but I will be back for the burger! I had the atomic burger which was mouth watering, my friend had the burgernator which was... intimidating three burgers sandwiched between grilled cheese sandwiches!?! I can't believe he ate the whole thing! Wait...yes I can. The line was a little long (now I know why) and seating was difficult (the place was packed) but I will be back for sure and I'm bringing friends! Overall this place has friendly service, is clean and has great food."}
{"text":"I took the challenge and I had The Burgernator and I have to say it was one of the best burgers I've ever had, the place is very nice and clean and the staff is friendly, their menu was simple and had some interesting options, my only complaint is that prices are a little high, so for a regular burger with fries and a drink it will cost you around $13, aside from that it's excellent."}
{"text":"I got the Commander, and there were pieces of it that were still really pink. Took a couple of bites and I could taste the difference in the meat where it was cooked and where it was not. The cooked parts tasted pretty average. Bun fell apart after a couple of bites. 

Service is kind of strange. You stand in line to order and find a seat (if you're lucky) and then they bring out your meals hollering your number to find your table. Our friends had 2 other groups of patrons brought their meals before them despite their numbers coming first. 

Decore is themed. I enjoyed the play on words and the story of the restaurant. \"Burgers are our weapons. The city is our battlefield.\" You order your burgers from \"the armory\". 

I don't think I'll be back myself because I personally hate under cooked meat. But if you like your burgers like that, hey give it a go."}
{"text":"I watched my burger get hand smushed on the grill, from one giant meatball to a thick, 6 oz patty- you don't get a fresher burger than this one. The menu selection is varied, which is great for the non-beef eaters out there, and I admit I had a really tough time choosing the Resistance Burger from among the other amazing options. But it was a good choice, the burger is juicy and full of flavour and the size is exactly what I expect for the price: enormous. We also had the Big Bang burger which was a good combination of spicy chicken tenders and burger (why not, I say!). 

Did I eat the burgernator itself? No. Why? Because I am not a 27 year old dude who does P90X religiously. However, my brother is. And he ate the entire threatening tower of meat, snuggled between two grilled cheese sandwiches. See the picture.... it was an incredible feat. 

Overall, I loved this place. The friendly owner came out to chat with us and it very much feels like they are giving a huge effort to make this place stick. It is my hope they survive the Toronto burger wars!"}
{"text":"Hands down have the BEST burgers I've ever tasted! I've been here 3 times so far- and each time, it always delivers! I've only gotten the Commander burger, which is a standard one patty burger with cheese and other toppings! I like burgers, but I'm not too obsessed with them- The Burgernator is the only place that really gets me excited! Their burgers are soft and juicy, ingredients fresh, and bun warm and toasty with a slight crisp! When you bite into it, it can get a little messy, but I think that just proves how good it is! It leaves you really satisfied, but not full or gross afterwards, which I really like.

The store is a little small, which is nice for hanging out or when it's nice out because you can eat outside, but it's a little hard to find seats when it's colder and around prime- lunch time. It's definitely worth waiting for a seat though, and the servers are all really nice. Bonus: The food is halal, which is awesome and means I can recommend it to more people!  I will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"We almost walked out because the meat wasn't organic but then they said it was at least local and freshly ground so we stayed. They were the most delicious burgers (3) that we have had for some time. JUICY is the key word! The patty was full of flavour as were the dressings. I can't remember the names but it was to be lamb and we asked him to switch to beef as we wanted the chipotle dressing. The head staff person was so friendly answering all our questions and convincing us that we would love them; and we did. I highly recommend if you are in a burger mood this place won't disappoint.
In Kensington Market too!"}
{"text":"I love this place, although I don't eat much red meat the beef was INCREDIBLE. you can tell it's high qualityy, this place is always packed around meal times. The staff work really hard and they're so kind and accommodating."}
{"text":"Maybe burgers aren't the thing to order in but the burger was very mediocre. The parties were fresh but besides that, meh. Chilli fries weren't what I was expecting for some reason - decent portion though. Definitely not worth 17$ between the two."}
{"text":"Great burger place, with patties that are clearly fresh rather than processed. Fast service, good seating. Our family with 4 growing boys devoured their meals and all give 2 thumbs up - that to me says it all."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place because almost every blog review mentioned it in the same breath as Burger's Priest. And that's the problem with Toronto right now, everyone compares every new burger place with burger's priest. Relax, everyone! Tr(eat) it for what it is.

The burger I had was good but it didn't blow me away. The patty seemed too solid and not as juicy as it could have been. But it did have some great, fresh toppings and a soft bun.

Can't complain about the price.

The Burgernator is new and there are quite a few menu options, so I will be back to try one of their specialty burgers and the onion rings.

They do a great job of promoting the restaurant on social media, and I've seen some specials/discounts advertised on their Facebook/Twitter accounts.

Love the name, too. Keep on fighting the good fight."}
{"text":"Such terrible service! Me and my boyfriend went and ordered before a party of six (who got their orders first) by the time ours came, it came without the sides, then they were STONE cold and we sent them back. When we finally did eat them it was an OK burger, I've honestly made way better at home. Over cooked brick style onion rings too, puke, never again. Spend your hard earned money at Burgers Priest instead."}
{"text":"Went here after finding out that there's another halal burger joint in Toronto. I went around 5pm-ish and found the place completely empty (i'm assuming because it's an awkward time to be having a meal..lunch or dinner?) anyway, LOVED the decor. There were only two employees there and I imagined the place to be much more inviting after seeing how interactive and exciting they are on social media. No one greeted us so my friend and I just decided what to get and the woman there took our order. Not as enthusiastic as I thought she would be :( Not that she was mean or rude or anything, I was just hoping she'd show some emotion! We ordered our food and sat down and it was 30 degrees out and it was BOILING inside the restaurant! I don't know why they didn't turn the AC on! On to the food: LOVED it. I don't understand how people are saying their burgers are dry, mine was SO juicy it was running down my fingers! I ordered the Big Bang and loved every bite. When i first got the tray, the portions looked small (compared to The Works) but do not be fooled! It is one filling meal. However, my friend got a chicken burger special (forgot the name) and said that he wasn't that filled but beef burgers always fill you up more than chicken burgers anyway. In summary, my only complaint would be that the employees should be a bit more enthusiastic and that the AC should be on when it's 30 degrees out! But besides that, their food is ON POINT and their aoili is to die for. 

Will be returning :)"}
{"text":"Located in the corner of Kensington market. Not dry, not too moist, soft, perfectly cooked - these are all I can say about the Patty. I went on a wet afternoon with my cousins. Captain Jerk was what I ordered, loved the jerk sauce on it. I wasn't sure if I would like the friend pineapple on a burger. but it blended in pretty well! 
One of my cousins took the fully loaded, and one took the one with Lamb Patty, both of them were delicious and they loved it. I just wish, the burgers were a bit bigger!

The person who was taking the order had a really great attitude. He explained in details about the menu. 

Only drawback of the place is their washrooms wasn't clean."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place 4 or 5 stars. I just couldn't get over how filthy this place was. The floors were sticky and the tables dirty. Tables weren't even wiped down. This might have been due to the fact that the person taking orders/cashier was also serving people and bussing tables. It appeared to me that they needed at least one additional person on hand. 

The ambiance is very casual. Couples and groups of friends hanging out, enjoying the food and company. One or two folks coming in and out for take out. 

I felt the service we received was quite poor. Initially my order was entered incorrectly and I had to repeat it three time for them to get it right. No big deal. So we finally get our burgers and boy are they delicious. They forgot two of our food items (fries and milkshake) and needed to be reminded twice before it finally came. By that time, we had already finished our burgers. It would have been lovely to get all the food together. Unfortunately that became quite the low point of our meal. Getting everything together helps to enhance the experience. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case for us! We really liked the burgers. The milk shake was sloppy and the jerk fries were just ok. 

I would love to go back and have their burgers again but if I'm ever in the neighbourhood I would approach with caution. I'll definitely stop in to see if the cleanliness had improved- that might determine if I stay or turn around and leave."}
{"text":"Declares war on all of your senses.
Hands down the best burger for the money I have had in Toronto. You know that coating of fat your get from a perfectly marbled Rib Eye steak. They give you that hear with their hand ground daily burgers.

Recommended cooked to medium rare - and would advise to keep it simple with the Burger with Cheese (no Bacon avail here due to religious beliefs of the proprietors) It's magical.... 5 stars all the way. Burgenator fries are something to write home about as well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. in the heart of hippyville and freeks and ppl pretending to be down and out but can afford $20 combos. Anyhow. love the food, love the atmosphere and black painted walls.

Had a commander burger, fries and root beer and it was all amazing. cooked well, great flavor and toppings.

i have to agree with the rest of the folks though...the tables are gross and theirs left over meat remains all over the place....clean it up and you will get a 5 star rating any day!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome new place! Way exceeded my expectations. 

The meat: SO fresh and they have lots of different types of meat. The turkey burger is perfectly cooked and juicy. My friend got a lamb one on my third visit and it tasted great- the taste of the meat didn't overpower the rest of the topping.

The sauces: Definitely one of my favourite parts about the restaurant. They have creative combinations and they don't skimp. They're so full of saucy goodness it's sometimes hard to keep them all together! 

My favourite: The resistance is my favourite so far. It's a masala turkey burger with mango chutney and curry aioli...sooooo good- especially if you like Indian food

Sides: The fries are crispy and delicious. My friend who got the poutine said it was the best she'd ever tried. I personally fell in love with the onion rings even though I'm usually not an onion ring person. 

When you're there play a game of cards against humanity- hilarious!

Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are awesome. We had an all chicken, chicken and beef mix burger, and beef only- all three were equally amazing. Fries are fresh. All in all a great burger experience! Loved it."}
{"text":"Great experience. The best part is that its all halal. Burgers were amazing and filling so make sure you have enough appetite to eat. Great service and quality of meat, home made fries was just another treat. Ah and dont forget to try their new Mars fried chocolate dessert simply awesome. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I loved their burgers.  I got the lamb burger and it was delicious.  I liked their take on a cold sourdough type bun and well cooked patty, and the sauces they used were amazing.  Second best burger I've had in my life.  100% Zabiha Halal!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger joint in town! Me and my family love this place, it's one of our favs...so much that we drive down from Woodbridge for it. The art in the rest. is definitely different and creates a hipster iishh ambiance, with Cards of Humanity to entertain yourselves while waiting. I would def recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and at a reasonable price. The burger meat was really good compared to some other halal burger places in the GTA."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best burgers in Toronto. These guys truly operate their business with tons of passion."}
{"text":"Excellent burger spot in Kensingtin Market.  I am American and we have TONS of spots in the U.S. but Burgernator has the best burgers I have tasted thus far... Try one and I am sure you will agree..."}
{"text":"My goto place for halal burgers in Toronto!! Been going there for years and have never been disappointed. Can get pretty busy at times and can be a little hard to find a seat."}
{"text":"I had the drop down and give me spicy burger and the burgernator. Great burgers, the burgernator being messy thanks to the 3 patties and grilled cheese. I see why people vote the burgernator as top 3 burger places in Toronto."}
{"text":"We got a bunch of different burgers; everyone dove right in (no chance to sneak in any bites to try anyone else's burger :( ) and it really hit the spot for us all.

I got the Captain Jerk and it was really good. I've never had grilled pineapple on a burger before, and it was amazing with the zing of the jerk sauce. Get it."}
{"text":"This place has a wide range of burgers and a wonderful mission (to serve non frozen hand made burgers made with locally sourced meat). The actual burger also tasted wonderful. I would love love to give this place five stars but it was filthy. The floor needed a really good sweep and I was tempted to do it myself just because I didn't want look at dirty napkins wafting around on the floor while I enjoyed my burger."}
{"text":"You can tell the burgers are made fresh, not frozen. Had the Resistance, which was the turkey burger with masala sauce. The sauce itself was somewhat sweet and tangy, which was quite the nice contrast to the tradition ketchup. 

For an awesome, local, authentic, fresh burger place, this is definitely one that deserves every dollar."}
{"text":"Went there because their meat is hallal and I was craving a burger. I'm was a little disappointed, the burger was really greasy but tasted good. I didn't like the ambiance with extra extra loud music but maybe I'm special."}
{"text":"One of our favorite stops! I had the Atomic Burger (which was delicious) and my husband had The Captain Jerk. We also had the poutine. The gravy was a little congealed which was a little off-putting but it actually tasted great. Customer service was great too. Definitely stop by."}
{"text":"EAT HERE NOW! They have the tastiest burger and gluten free bun that I have ever eaten.  The owner was well versed in celiac disease and told me what not to eat. I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I've had. Try one with an egg. Great chilli cheese fries too."}
{"text":"Was in downtown Toronto for a seminar and me and a group of my friends went two days in a row for lunch. First day I had the Fully Loaded combo. Not only was it one of the most juiciest and most delicious burgers I've ever had, but I was absolutely full till the night. Second day I had the Bulldozer which was just a good but smaller. The place is always packed and its in a very hipster place in downtown. The only downside you'd see here is not being able to find a place to sit."}
{"text":"Must try the Captain Jerk burger and the Burgernator fries!"}
{"text":"Burger was just ok, poutine was worst I've ever had. For the food alone I would give it 2 stars, but the service was absolutely atrocious. My two friends ordered after me but were brought their burgers first (but had to wait an additional 10 min for their below average quality fries), I had to wait 20 minutes for my food, and the food runner kept saying that, \"they had to serve other people first,\" when I would ask when I could expect my food. A final note, this place has a listed closing time of 10:00 on Saturdays, but tonight they started turning away customers at 9:30, losing about 15 customers' business.

I can't understand why this place is rated so highly, for a better burger and much better service try Burger Priest."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! we tried for 2 days! we were visiting from NY and they told us to go because they don't have any meat. How can you run out of meat at a burger place??  Pretty much no guarantee of getting service within 2 hours of closing."}
{"text":"Paid $16 for Big Bang, fries and coke can. Wow, that's kinda expensive. Was each bite worth $3.25? Nope. More like .70 cents. 

The burger was good. A little dry. But Good. Bun could be better. Patty was delicious. 

The fries sucked, soggy. Give it a miss!

Would I try it again? Maybe. If it was cheaper... or maybe a cheaper option burger and skip the \"meal deal\""}
{"text":"I Ordered Captain Jerk. It is pretty good, the grilled pineapple in it is really delicious and the beef is really juicy."}
{"text":"I checked out this place as a part of Burger Week. Had a spicy Texan burger (I think that's what it was called) that had cheese stuffed INSIDE the patty. It was great! And actually quite spicy which made the day feel even hotter. The presentation is just a tray and a huge almost tipping-over burger. The space is very stuffy and smoky from the kitchen. But the owner turned on the air-conditioning upon request and seemed very keen to make sure that my burger was done to spec."}
{"text":"This place is great! Do call ahead if you want a fast burger for pickup. I guess that's because they make it fresh. I've tried the bazooka and one with the egg on top. I do love the menus on the walls. Very neat. In the summer it does get a bit smokey in there but they put a picnic bench out making a great spot for people watching. I'm not sure they make a veggie burger for my vegetarian friends. When I've ordered a combo with fries its way too much food for this girl to eat alone so I suggest to split the fries if you take a friend with you. All in all I'd recommend this as a quality burger joint."}
{"text":"Major disappointment given all the positive reviews.  My burger completely fell apart after 1 bite.  Literally both the meat patty AND the bun disintegrated immediately.  I ended up picking at the remains of my burger with a fork.  I ended up paying $20 for a shake and a practically inedible burger.  Just awful."}
{"text":"Tried the bazooka burger,  best burger I tried so far.   The beef patty was so good,  that I could have eaten it by itself.   They run out of items, so get their early.  I wasn't able to try the poutine cause they ran out of gravy.   Didn't like the rocket fries."}
{"text":"As soon as we settled down at our hostel, we were so hungry so we decided to try this place out. We were walking around the market and this place looked nice since we passed by it. 
It reminded me much of Farmburger in Atlanta, GA. The place is small and cozy. The man at the cash register was really sweet.
They do have vegetarian options if you are a vegetarian. My friend and I both got the veggie burger called the AK Veggie 7 with a side of fries. It came out at a very reasonable time. We didn't wait long. It smelled delicious. They fries were really good. On point. And the burger was huge. It was flavorful, but it got messy! So get ready to use a lot of napkins! But the messier the burger, the better. Hah! 
The bathroom by the way was a little sketchy downstairs... I would take a friend."}
{"text":"This place was so good! The menu was large (in a good way) and everything sounded so good that it took me a while to decide what I wanted.

I got the \"Drop Down and Get Your Spicy On\" burger with poutine and it did NOT disappoint. The burger was juicy and flavorful and the fries were crispy and hot. I'm so happy we stumbled upon this place and would love to visit on my next trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I went there 3 times so far and ordered 3 different burgers. Everytime my burgers came perfectly cooked, moist and full of flavour. I don't like to make a choices regarding what goes on my burger so I was happy to see that they have predesigned toppings for their burgers. I also love the decor. Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is a real burger in the sense that it is 100% beef with no fillers.

The meat is real 100% beef but the best burgers are not made with 100% beef, it's usually a mix of lamb and/or pork in addition to beef, but since it is a store that is halal (no pork), it is understandable why they do not have pork mixed into their chuck.

That said, I quite enjoyed the burger. I got the \"Fully Loaded\" burger.

It was a bit grainy and dry but that's the taste of real beef. I cannot say I LOVED it but it was a good burger and quite filling. The other parts of it like the tomato, lettuce, bun.. it was all \"meh\" for me.

I couldn't really taste the caramelized onions nor the mushrooms (they were a bit stingy) and there wasn't enough cheese on it to be melty and good.

I wouldn't actually travel back to eat the burgers specifically, but I would stop in here and buy one if I had a craving and was in the area. It sure beats McDo.

(I also didn't eat the fries because I am not a fan of fries unless they are homemade.)"}
{"text":"This place was middle-of-the-road for me. Their burger was good, just nothing special. I ordered the Commander, which is one of their \"Classic\" burgers. The only change I asked for was to sub their Burgernator Sauce for the chipotle aioli. I also upgraded from a 4oz patty to a 6oz ($2.00 upcharge). 

The burger looked delicious! It had a little caramalized crust on the beef that was mouthwatering. However, there didn't seem to be much flavour to the beef, or the toppings... I would also say that the size of the bun slightly overwhelmed the burger as a whole. So, overall, I was a little disappointed. Not that anything was bad, it just didn't WOW me in any way. 

On the positive, their fries were great! I also liked the vibe of the restaurant with the army theme and overall decor. It's in a prime location, and the price seemed to be more than fair. They had very friendly service, although a little on the slow side - but they got the order with my requests right the first time. I just wish the burger had done more for me..."}
{"text":"I found it very difficult to find this restaurant. The name is written on a transparent glass window that's hardly noticeable, and at the top where restaurant names normally are there's a picture of a burger. 

Anyhow, The burger itself:
I ordered the Baconator. The beef bacon was good...but the beef patty itself was so bland and unseasoned, which made the rest of the burger just taste so meh. 

This is my second time here since they opened, and it doesn't taste any different. Still the same bland burgers people are hyping up about. The aesthetics look better than it tastes."}
{"text":"We did a take out here through door dash. I don't recommend that. They might be a better location to visit.
All an all the burgers were delish and the customer service made up for it all!
Thank you Amer and family"}
{"text":"The Burgernator, located in Kensington Market, makes burgers using fresh, never frozen beef and no fillers.

I ordered the Mission of the Week, which was the Havana Night Fever. This is a burger with lean lamb, papaya and cilantro salsa, pomegranate glaze, tomato, lettuce. The burger combo included fries, soft drink for $13.99 plus HST.

The flame grilled lamb patty was nicely cooked well. The bun was not nicely toasted. I don't know if it was an attempt to warm up the bun or toast the bun, but I find it strange to see only the edge on one side of a bun with signs of toasting. Either evenly toast the buns or don't even bother to put the buns on the grill. My burger order was the last one being cooked in a lunch hour rush of orders. The fries were OK, but a bit too much salt was sprinkled on."}
{"text":"Came all the way from Chicawgeaux. Burgers are fireeeeee. Just go here. Thats all Im going to say. Just. Go. Here."}
{"text":"Ordered the big bang burger and made it a combo with a pop and fries. The burger came out in around 10 minutes which was faster than I expected.  It was well presented and a good size.  The patty was juicy and the chicken strip in the burger was succulent.

The price is comparable to other casual burger restaurants in the city. It is also one of the only restaurants open later in the Kensington Market area."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!
I ordered the basic Sergeant burger (lettuce, tomato, pickles, burgernator sauce) and was very pleased with it. I'm a basic burger girl and the patty was juicy, not over-charred, and full of flavour. Our group also had the atomic burger and the special bacon burger that they were offering at the time. Everyone was pleased with their orders.
We also had the poutine and sweet potato fries. Poutine was subpar. But definitely try the burgers!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Hands down one of my fave burger places in Toronto. It's not greasy, portion size is good. I've gotten both captain jerk and the one with the egg on it I forgot the name. I really like the egg one. The pineapple is a nice touch. The meat tastes so good like it was freshly made and not frozen. It's a little pricy for just a burger but I keep coming back. 

Seats can be hard to find at times so come early enough. 
Good for family and friends!"}
{"text":"Had a burger here with my girlfriend and it was amazing...

The owner is a stickler for quality always asking how he can make a better burger. This man is on a mission to have the greatest burger in the city and he won't stop.

Amazing burgers."}
{"text":"Tasty.  To be totally honest, I'm not sure it's better than Burger Priest at all but it's certainly a very good burger and the onion rings weren't laughing either.  Because sh*t was no joke.  So it gets the 4 stars...."}
{"text":"This place is Burger Heaven! As a New Yorker, I'm not usually impressed with places outside of the US. We have similar things in New York so it's hard to have a \"new experience\" in anything. This place completely blew me away! It's awesome! The Big Bang burger was heavenly! The service was amazing as well, it was a little hot but the food was delicious! I can see myself always coming here when I visit Canada! If there is one place you need to go, it's this place!"}
{"text":"I love burgernator! Such a cool atmosphere and the burgers are to die for, so big and juicy. There isn't too much seating though so be aware of that if you go during rush hours, but I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Today I had the best burger of my life at Burgernator. Seriously - this place is amazing. The burgers are beyond juicy & delicious, the fries are perfection and the price is right."}
{"text":"With so many burger joints in the city, how do you make a memorable burger?  Five magical words - Deep... Fried.. Herb... Crusted... Cheese. NOM! That's the atomic burger.  Got my burger medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and served fast.  Had to get rid of the top bun to bite it and thank goodness I did otherwise I wouldn't be able to finish this beefy piece of heaven.  The drop down and give me spicy was another menu item I got the pleasure of trying.  Loved the chipotle bbq sauce, sauteed jalapenos and onion rings.  

My not so favourite thing was the poutine.

When I return (and I definitely will return) I will try another burger and ask for the deep fried cheese on top - YOLO!"}
{"text":"Looong wait, sweaty hot kitchen and seating area. The were cooks sweating profusely over the food. I feel bad for them; it's not their fault but rather the business owner's. This was in the summer, and I've not been here during winter to know if the seeat problem persists. Burger was subpar; we won't come back."}
{"text":"Hipster-y, just like everything else in this area. Captain Jerk and the Atomic Burger are certified goodness. The cheese in the Atomic Burger was something I craved for days after. Fries were fresh and the dips were good. Plenty of seatings for dine ins."}
{"text":"An average burger joint. 
There were large groups and families dining in when we went, so you may have to wait for a table. Go up to order, take a seat and they'll bring you your order. 

Decided to be adventurous for once and ordered Captain Jerk with the jerk sauce and pineapple. I was expecting it to be mindblowing and ready to be punched with flavours but that sadly did not happen. The patty and pineapple were much smaller than the bun so it was a lot of straight up bread eating. Actually wished that I had ordered a plain burger (one of those 4oz ones) instead. The disappointing part was that I saw the staff use Villagio burger buns--not sure if I was expecting a more local bread--and that the buns came cold. not warmed or toasted. 
The French fries weren't as fresh as we had wished but they were still good. Came with a killer aioli. 

Probably will not be back to fulfill a burger craving."}
{"text":"Hi! Haaaaaave you met...Bazooka Jr. And Captain Jerk? You haven't had a sweet burg til you've tried Burgernator. The Bazooka Jr. I had was simply divine, cannot put into words. In my opinion it was the better of the burgers I had, maybe because of the fried egg they inserted between the buns as well! A job well done."}
{"text":"Greatest burgers in Toronto! Come here on an empty stomach cause you will be super full once you leave. Portions are huge"}
{"text":"My favourite burger place in the city. They have gluten free buns and I usually get their 'Mission of the Week' or their veggie burger. I have never been disappointed, they're always very flavourful and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"The inside was a lot bigger than expected and has a casual seating. The cashier was helpful and friendly, and I have a lot of respect for the hard working chefs in the kitchen. 

Additionally, I was blown away by the taste of the burger I had which was the Big Bang. It was incredible!  However, I was not a huge fan of the fries. But I will definitely be returning for another burger soon..."}
{"text":"Stopped by here last winter and I loved the burger! By far one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto and definitely worth stopping by anytime your in the Kensington area. The shop itself is very bare bones and the cutlery and napkins station could have been more tidy, I'm a bit of a stickler with cleanliness and presentation that feels clean when I eat so while it wasn't dirty it was needing a wipe here and there. Easily overlooked for the taste of the burger, they combo many good flavours and ingredients, I love a fried egg on a burger and they have a few different options I'll need to go back and try. My meal was perfectly cooked and I loved the seasoned ground chuck they use for their patties."}
{"text":"Laughably slow and disorganized. Watched as they fumbled their way though a pile of orders. Literally looked like we were watching chickens walk (not run) around with their heads cut off. A more accurate simile is that they looked like undead Walkers.  Sad. Sad. Sad."}
{"text":"I was sooo excited to try this place out since I love my burgers. I forgot the name of the burger I got but it had two patties and a fried egg.Would have been a 4 star but for two things. Size of the burger and inconsistent \"doneness\" of patties. Now with the size, don't get me wrong it was anything but a small burger. The problem is that they spent so much effort crafting it to look impressive that it was really difficult to eat. I tried to use the squish down method to eat it but in the end I actually had to use a knife and fork which really took away from my burger eating experience. What really bugged me was that one of my patties was significantly more raw than the other. Before burger connoisseurs jump on me and say \"patties are supposed to be slightly rare\", the middle of one patty was legit raw while the other was perfectly cooked. I did eat the raw bits though (yes I'm a daredevil) but found myself kind of worried afterwards that I'd get sick (ok..I'm a paranoid daredevil). Luckily I was perfectly ok which I suppose is a nod towards the quality of beef they use right? ;)

Overall decent burger joint. Will come back if convenient. Will probably opt for the single patties though (even though they seem more boring) since they seem easier to eat."}
{"text":"Crazy filling! Definitely wasn't hungry for a WHILE after exiting this joint, so dessert would probably not be a good idea unless you're interested in sleeping right after lol. I ordered (I honestly forgot the name) but it had onion rings, and 2 patties, and some spicy sauce atop which tasted like Frank's red. Anywho, it was very thick and meaty (that's what she said) and alas I couldn't even finish some of the bun. I just ate the meat lol. The fries came with some garlic aoili I wanna say? I could be wrong, but they were pretty good. Wasn't too busy, staff friendly, casual atmosphere and decent prices."}
{"text":"Hasta la Vista, Birdie is delish! People come here for the burgers, but I don't eat ground beef. So, if you don't eat hamburgers, definitely try the chicken! The onions rings were a little too crispy for my taste, but very good otherwise."}
{"text":"The Atomic Burger was delish! I enjoyed the deep fried herb crusted cheese and their lightly toasted egg buns! Also shared the Burgernator Fries and Salted Caramel Milkshake, very tasty!

I took one star away because it was -20 outside and their heater was not working."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for burgers, and I must say this place is pretty darn good. I went with a couple of my friends, we tried Captain Jerk and Atomic Burger. Captain Jerk has a bit of a kick to it, but since I'm not so good with spices, I stuck to the atomic burger. The burger is freshly made, very juicy, and my favourite is the deep-fried cheese (not too overwhelming). 

Also, if you have the room for it, make sure you try the milkshake! Very smooth and thirst-quenching.

Will be back for more."}
{"text":"This place is very good a very great burger restaurant, the quality of the burger patties is  solid and the options for combos is great! It stands out from most burger places in toronto. The interior is cozy, but because it's small, it can be hard to find a spot to sit. Service is friendly, am definitely going to gp back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. Super friendly staff. The buns were perfect, and the sun-dried tomato mayo was superb. Juiciest patty I've ever had."}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible but the food arrived cold and wasn't especially flavourful. 

Ordered their cheeseburger and the chilli fries. Food was warm at best, wasn't even warm enough to melt the cheese. 

They had a cool atmosphere, the music they were playing was great, but the furniture looked and felt like it was bought second hand from an hockey rink that had been renovated. 

This place is for sure a step up from from a fast food chain but it's for sure not the best burger in city."}
{"text":"Came in today and ordered the most basic burger (I can't remember what the name of it is...) & a poutine. 
The burger was alright- nothing special really. The special sauce didn't really have any flavor except mayo, but seeing as I love mayo on my burger, this was ok with me.  The bun wasn't toasted, and was a little cold and dry. 
The poutine was a disaster. The fries here suck. It's almost as though they tried to bread them a bit or something. They were mushy and the gravy was lacking flavor and color. It looked like canned chicken gravy. I didn't eat mine, and my friend was scooping hers up like soup. 
The branding is simple and trendy- the people running the place don't really suit the style- it doesn't feel authentic- more like they're jumping on the burger joint bandwagon and for that it comes across a little fake and desperate. 
i didn't enjoy watching the husband cook while the (what I assume is his) wife taking orders... I actually felt guilty ordering."}
{"text":"So consistently good! Owner is so nice, everyone is friendly, they even bring your burger right to your table. Overall definitely pricey for a burger as long as your not eating it everyday who cares this is worth the try. My husband and I shared the large crazy burger called the \"Burgernator\" with 3 patties and grill cheeses...not a good idea, way too greasy and I felt like I was going to have a heart attack after. Taste was good though lol. My go-to here is the \"Big-Bang\" which is their regular beef patty burger with buffalo chicken strips on top, there's just something so unique about eating chicken on beef that makes this burger so good. Their fries aren't too impressive so I would just stick with the burger and avoid the filler.

HALAL= YASSSSSS

Beware they cook their patties medium so if you want it well-done you have to ask, also the day I went there was no A/C on and it was pretty brutal, still worth it though!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best burgers and poutine!! 

Huge delicious, fresh, amazing burgers in all of Canada. The produce is fresh and the meat is cooked well on a grill. The poutine is the best I've ever had too!

The interior design is cool and the menu is on the wall not on a board. 

Clever name and a genuine burger business.

5/5"}
{"text":"Came into here not really expecting anything special in terms of a burger, but boy was I surprised! Even at 9:30pm on a Sunday this place was packed--tells you how good the food is. I had the Captain Jerk, a 6oz beef patty with grilled pineapple and jerk sauce...at $9 seemed a bit expensive, but after tasting it I would say it was worth it! The meat was very juicy, flavourful, and the pineapple really made it work. Only downside is the slow service--you can see the guys working hard in the back but there were simply so many people lined up, it took a good 20+ minutes for my order to be fulfilled."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced (I paid $10 for basically a chicken sandwich?), but I appreciate the pride they take in their food. Slightly greasy, though that's to be expected. 
The girl working the cashier extremely cold, and borderline rude. Is it so hard to say thank you with a smile? Come on. This is Canada."}
{"text":"I went to The Burgernator for a late Sunday lunch with my husband Matt B. and our friend Liz L. while we were visiting Toronto. We all wanted to check out Kensington Market before leaving town, and picked this place because it seemed fast and easy and my picky husband was craving a burger.

It was a cute casual restaurant, with friendly counter service and self seating. The walls were blackboard black, and the menu and a Burgernator manifesto were printed right on it in cheerful white lettering, along with several burgery little graphics. The place was quite busy, even at 2:30 in the afternoon. By the time we got up at 3:00, it was full. Some woman actually asked if we were done eating like the second it looked like we might have stopped chewing our food. We said yes before recognizing how weird and rude that was, and gave up our table for her party.

The food was tasty and satisfying. There were over a dozen burgers on the menu, most of them B.M.D., or \"Burgers of Mass Destruction,\" made with 6 oz. patties (hardly killing anyone) and creative combinations of toppings. There were also a handful of burgers in the Classic Arsenal--4 oz. patties, by-the-book toppings--as well as a couple of vegetarian options. With the exception of the eponymous Burgernator, a monster with three patties between two grilled cheese sandwiches, all of the burgers were $10.99 or less. I got the Captain Jerk, a B.M.D. with an all beef patty, grilled pineapple, havarti cheese, lettuce, tomato, and jerk sauce. This was a great fast food style burger, with decent juice to the patty and nice flavor from the pineapple and spicy sauce. Matt got the classic Commander and enjoyed it, and Liz was impressed with her veggie burger. The sides were also solid. The homemade fries were crispy and well seasoned, and I was happy to get some poutine while in Canada. The General Poutine came with house fries, melted cheese curds, and homemade gravy, and it was a salty, cheesy, gravy-soaked mess that really hit the spot. For some sugar, I liked the vanilla milkshake, which I kept stealing away from Matt. It was sweet and creamy and reminded me of McDonald's, but like rosy childhood memories of McDonald's.

This was a great spot for a quick meal, and I'd recommend it if you're in the mood for a burger. The only real downside is that you can't get a beer, and you might get chased out of your seat by a lurking stranger. Think of The Burgernator as a hip fast food joint and you should be pretty happy with your meal."}
{"text":"I was recommended here by a friend , Amazing food, amazing service , third time here no disappointments, will definitely recommend family and friends in the future."}
{"text":"Like most fast food services you order at the front and wait until your food is made. The only difference here is that they will deliver the burgers when they are ready. Napkins and other stuff can be found in the middle of the restaurant. I know tipping is always a big debate in the online communities, but like I personally wouldn't tip more than 15% here unless you do a huge take-out order.

[Food]
Milkshake
Definitely not horrible. Average at best. I really can't comment too much on it because it was just okay (easy to slurp but the taste wasn't long-lasting).

[Burgers]
To start off, everything is made on the spot so supposedly it's fresh. The burgers are definitely warm when they are served and unlike other restaurants, they will fit into your mouth (no surgeries required to overly widen that jaw). The atomic burger I ordered was quite good, especially the fried crusted cheese - I would say it is to die for. The bun itself did not surprise me as it was not SUPER soft. My boyfriend's burger was just regular lols, we don't even remember the name (damn).

Overall this place is pretty nice, given that it's located in Kensington Market I'm surprised there's room for bathrooms downstairs. Unfortunately they were renovating or something so the entire floor was covered in wet paint (referring to the basement) and I did not know how to walk around it. Quite a chill environment. I do like it, but no WOW factor."}
{"text":"The Atomic burger was Atomic Bomb!! A burger with fried cheese on top... OMG who would have thought it would be so delicious. The cheese oozed out with every bite and the sundried tomato sauce was a welcome treat for my taste buds!!"}
{"text":"I had their sergeant and lieutenant burgers, sweet potato fries, and regular fries. Overall the burgers were pretty good.  The fries were ok.  A bit on the greasier side though.  However, the service was not very friendly which made the atmosphere somewhat negative."}
{"text":"Omg. Gourmet halal burgers, what more can I say. I can't speak for the chicken, this review is solely for the MEAT. Come here if you're craving some good old fashioned meat. The burgers however are each uniquely crafted, which means you can come here multiple times and not be bored with the same old menu. Not a huge fan of the fries though, but who cares because the burgers were amazing!"}
{"text":"Orders:
1 Burgernator (3 beef patties in between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches - BLAUGH!! My boyfriend is crazy).
1 AK-Veggie (or whatever it's called) soy burger. 
1 Poutine
2 drinks

The Burgernator looked so gross and wrong but if super fatty, heart-stopping burgers are your thing, do it up! I for one couldn't even attempt it. My boyfriend said it was juicy and very filling (obvs! lol) I've attached a photo for you all to see this piece of work! Something you'd definitely see on Man Vs. Food!

The soy burger was very good too, didn't taste frozen at all. Love the guacamole on it, but would've be tastier with a bit more fixings (ie, more veggies!). For the true vegetarian, this is a good option. 

Poutine was good too. 

Prices are fair considering these are considered gourmet burgers. I will probably try one of their chicken burgers if I happen to be hungry & in the area.

You won't leave hungry, that's for sure :)"}
{"text":"So much food for not a super high price! I got the loaded burger and loved it! VERY quick service, too."}
{"text":"We are on the hunt for the BEST BURGER in Toronto! Stop #2: The Burgernator

For stop #2 I differed to the expertise of Google and Yelp's combined reviewing power to see what Torontonians on mass think is the best burger bite in the city. At the top of the list comes the Burgernator. (8.7/10)

When I imagine how the decor decisions were made for this space I get the feeling that a couple of college guys came together after a game of COD and thought up the most manly establishment that they could muster; black walls, war and weapon related food names, and a kitchen in the back that doesn't pretend to be fancy. No complaints here.

To move to the food, when I placed my order and asked for \"the best burger in Toronto\" the cashier enthusiastically suggested the apparently award winning, life changing, and orgasm enducing \"The Big Bang\". (Admittedly that last part may be a little bit of personal colour language.)
The Big Bang is an all beef patty, topped with buffalo chicken strips, Canadian cheddar cheese, tomato, lettuce, with roasted garlic aioli. To be honest, before ordering I thought that this was the least interesting of their burgers, but hey, I differ to the staff's judgement. That was apparently a poor choice. Now don't get me wrong. The burger wasn't bad at all, but for what's supposedly the best burger in the city, someone got a little enthusiastic in their description, (and that's coming from me). The beef patty appeared to be of pretty solid quality, but it was lacking seasoning. The chicken strips were also present... they were nice and not much else. If it's not clear yet, I was disappointed.

In my then depression, I rallied back and ordered the Explosion: a deep fried Mars bar, served with vanilla ice cream, drizzled with chocolate sauce. Cuz common, no one's gonna F around and not give me a deep fried Mars bar that instantly cheers me up... I was meagerly cheered, mostly due to the fact that I had to saw the Mars bar apart rather than gently free it from its breaded bonds. Who knows, maybe I was just bitter due to the preceeding affront.

On the bright side the Rocket Fries were frighteningly satisfying. This dish is like a play on poutine, featuring homemade jerk, beautifully fused with garlic & cheddar cheese sauces over homemade fries. The day was saved by these fries.

Anyway, please allow me to reiterate that as a regular burger place, The Burgernator is a great choice that I'd be happy to return to, but let's all come back to reality and recognise that this is no best burger in Toronto. #DontBelieveTheHype"}
{"text":"I loved this burger restaurant. The burger melted in my mouth and was so juicy. The bun was also fresh and high quality - a good sign of a serious burger restaurant. You should expect a higher price and longer lines because of this. However, it's worth it."}
{"text":"It was alright."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and we were VERY disappointed.

Battle Fields Burger: For the price you pay, I was expecting it to be better crafted. It looked like it was just slapped together. The bun reminded me a lot of a dry McDonald's bun - yellow in colour and no substance to it, y'know? The menu said it was a \"crusted\" portobello but the crust was more like a thick, tasteless deep-fried breading. I couldn't even taste the mushroom at all! The cheese was excessive and overpowered the taste of everything else. This place isn't good if you want well-crafted food that has any kind of taste profile. This place is better for someone who wants a step-up from McDonald's or Burger King and that could be what you want, but... not for me. I expected more pride... more craft...

Lieutenant Burger: Apart from the fact the 2 patties tasted like 'meat', I felt like I was eating something from a truck stop, with slightly better cheese. The bun could have been replaced with sugar-coated paper towel. Presentation was terrible. The amount of oil dripping from my burger was substantial. The overly loud trap/hip-hop music was horrendous. I was excited to try this place, the sandwich board outside stating to \"Join us in our mission of ridding the city of half-hearted and over-cooked burgers and processed cheese.\" was so hopeful - if Toronto is your battlefield and Burger is your weapon, well... see you in hell, buddy."}
{"text":"Bulldozer burger...can I say yummy! This was delicious and meaty. It had everything I was looking for in a great burger. Good tasting patty, still moist and not fatty. The bun was nice and soft. I loved the toppings on this. I don't eat lamb that often. So when I get a chance I always jump at the chance. 

Lamb patty, Havarti cheese, jalape√±o, mango salsa, chipotle aioli all the flavours complimented each other to make this an amazing burger. The jalape√±o added a nice kick. It was one of the best burgers, I've tried. 

There is quite a lot of seating inside for you to sit and eat, as well as seating outside. The inside is all black with their mission and menu on the wall. 

I'll be here again to try their other burgers. The burgers are pricier for the food in the area, but if you are looking for a high quality burger look no further! This is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Been there twice, phenomenal burgers.  Really enjoyed the Bazooka Jr.  The meat is loosely packed and seasoned well and makes for a juicy burger.  I really like that they saute their jalapenos and peppers.  The Poutine fries were okay.  The kids at the next table recommended the Burgernator Fries which I'll try next time."}
{"text":"OH EM GEE - these burgers were the best.  They are made from fresh ground beef, the ingredients tasted like they just came off the farm.  The food it amazing.  I really enjoyed my burger and it was cooked to perfection.  I watched him cook my burger from scratch!  

It was fast, I liked the interior and exterior of the place.  My fries were delish.  Next time I'll definitely try a more specialty burger.  I went with their most \"regular\" one because I was craving a traditional burger at the time.

Also, if you ask for medium you really do get medium!"}
{"text":"Good burgers . Good location. Definitely a try if your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Whooops! I guesse my eyeballs weren't doing their job - looks like I'm upping these guys to a full, and well deserved, five stars. See below for why:

Hi Oliver - thank you so much for your glowing review!

We actually do recycle- our blue box that is usually by the garbage can was damaged so we removed it and have been manually sorting for disposal. We only get a limited amount of garbage 'tags' so we try our best to minimize garbage disposal - good for our environment and our/customer's wallets!

Hope to see you again soon,

{"text":"My favourite burger joint in Toronto. I usually get the drop down and give me spicy ... or if I'm really craving meat , I would get The Burgernator ( triple stacked beef patties with grilled cheese as buns).

The burger patties are always fresh and cooked perfectly. I like it better than Burger Priest and like it much better than places like Hero Burger."}
{"text":"To be honestly truthful, I'm a little offended as a hamburger lover. I was not impressed by the dark decor and watching the prep work in plain view is not appetizing at all.

Don't get me wrong. I enjoy watching cooks cooking and preparing our food in front of us, which makes me feel good knowing that nothing weird is happening to it. The only objection I have is watching prep work being done right next to it. I had the pleasure of watching raw chicken being cut and portioned next to my burger and fries. That being said, I made sure that there was no cross contamination being done and I did not get food poisoning after eating the burger. Even though you are being careful, you should not be doing this. You don't light a cigarette while pumping gas! Right?!

Anyways. Got a little side tracked here. Back to the review. I ordered the commander burger and fries, and the wife had the ak-veggie 7. The bun was too big for the burger and both burgers were dry and flavourless. Fries were soggie - enough said. I will not be returning."}

{"text":"The decor is really nice (even downstairs!) They really tried to keep the whole \"army\" theme. I came with a couple of friends and we probably spent more times taking pictures in the basement washrooms than eating. 
As for the food, we all ordered a lieutenant burger paired with fries (regular, sweet potato, and burgernator fries). The fries were a bit too oily and happened our portions happened to contain more of the smaller, very fried and greasy potato strips. I wouldn't recommend getting the burgernator fries as it basically tasted like a spicy fries supreme, at a much higher price. Although the burger was delicious and juicy, it fell apart very easily. It is nice to know they use fresh (I hope) ground meat but it would be beneficial for them to wait for the patty to solidify and shape more before serving it.
The service was alright. It was different to understand and communicate with the cashier as she seemed like she just wanted to get my order in, even though there was no line up and I was asking legitimate questions. 
I would still give this place 4 stars because of the atmosphere and my love for Kensington Market!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the burgers are so yummy. The bun melts in your mouth too 
Brought my friend from out of town and she was super impressed as well."}
{"text":"I had the chicken sandwich since I'm cutting back on red meat and it was the best chicken sandwich I've had in a long time. I also recently tried the veggie burger but that was ok. I probably won't try the veggie burger again but will definitely go back for another chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I had the special of the week which was a lamb burger with a yogurt mint sauce and an avocado salsa. It was amazing, best burgers ever."}
{"text":"Food: Verities of Burgers of both Chicken and beef. 
Taste: Excellent specially beef burgers 
Location: Congested sitting and parking problem
Recommendation: Try B Seven"}
{"text":"Honestly don't know what the hype is about. Heard this was good from friends, so I had high hopes going in. Unfortunately my meal wasn't quite what I expected. I had the \"atomic\" burger. The patty was terribly overcooked and dry. Seasoning was nearly nonexistent, leaving the burger tasting incredibly bland. The fried cheese was a good idea, but wasn't executed well. Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone. Try the place down the street instead."}
{"text":"The place has great burgers. The drop down and give me spicy is a great choice.  Cool place with great ambiance.  For a combo it is about $14-15 so not expensive.   For dessert The Explosion which is a fried mars bar is awesome!!! A good experience and a definite repeat."}
{"text":"Located in heart of Kensington. Burgernator is a medium-sized place with an open kitchen. The gentleman at cash who seem to be the owner was a nice friendly guy. Good service.

I had the Lieutenant which is double patty burger 4 oz each. Pretty good from the sauce to patty. Not a fan of cheese but it as a minor thing

Also got rocket fries which was a garlic, chill cheese fries and they were the start of my meal I would go back just for them.

Where it fell flat was the milkshake, it was Just chocolate milk. No thickness or creaminess to it.


Definitely a good burger spot"}
{"text":"Food: 
 - Ordered the \"Drop and give me spicy\" - an unusual juicy burger, lots of food, with excellent flavour. I loved it.  Everyone in our party also loved their meals (except the person who ordered a veggie patty).

Service & Atmosphere:
- Standard fair quick burger joint service with a dark decor that fits it rather well.  Wished for a little more light though.

This juicy burger joint is a must try for anyone visiting the area."}
{"text":"Came here by chance the other day while walking through Kensington Market to find a place to eat. I was originally going to eat Mexican food but stopped here instead because it didn't look as busy.

And I'm glad I came! Burgers are freshly made, even the bun is flavourful and not dry either. 

Will stop by again next time!"}
{"text":"my friend and I randomly walked by this place and thought we'd get a burger. Slightly overwhelmed and very excited at the various options, I decided to go with the Big Bang and home fries which he told me \"was to die for\". He was right- everything was to die for!!! Would go back again, til the next time!"}
{"text":"I had the ATOMIC BURGER here a few times and the daily special  a couple of times. Always excellent. glad to see places this good in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Loved their veg burger. It was delicious. Will surely go again when I go back to Toronto :)"}
{"text":"Excellent veggie burger patty. Nice and moist, which is usually an impossibility with veggie burgers. I wish the grilled pineapple was fresh and that the fries were crispy. Often impossible to get a table and mysteriously full of rude people."}
{"text":"Why?  Everything about this place should be great, medium rare burgers, good buns, great fries, but I swear to god they've never heard of seasonings. Everything is bland and flavourless. And what's the deal with using frozen onion rings? That's embarrassing! Onion rings are easy as hell to make from scratch and a billion times better that way! I will show you how to make bomb onion rings, please up your game!"}
{"text":"I had the AK-Veggie7 Burger, and while I do typically tend to shy away from soy-based veggie patties, this one was amazing. It had great texture, the bun was so good, and the toppings were perfect. The fries and aioli were also really good. My friend chose the Atomic Burger and it was super well-received by her as well! Burgernator...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My partner recently visited The Burgernator (early in the day on a Saturday) and couldn't stop talking about his tasty burger.  So we decided to visit this past Friday evening....

Atmosphere:  Very uncomfortable if you're not wasted.  Loud and dirty.
Service:  The counter girl was very nice.  Our burgers took over 20 minutes to come out (but it was very busy).
Food:  I got a commander burger and poutine.  I had to send the poutine back because the gravy was cold, and then added lots of salt to give it some kind of flavor.  The hamburger was just as bad; meat was overcooked, dry, flavourless, cold buns, unmelted cheese.  My partner said his Atomic burger wasn't a good as last time for the same reasons.  

In the end, I think most of the issues stem from there being not enough staff to keep the up quality."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joint I have been to in the city, great prices and the quality is amazing. The fries are good and they dont cheap out. Great place for a burger."}
{"text":"I was walking by with my friends and we decided to stop by and try it out. There are quite a  bit of options in the menu. The prices are good and the food was really good as well. Next time I come I would definitely try something a little more exciting (I had the commander with poutine)."}
{"text":"I came in at 8:45, when the place closed at 9:00. We stood there for 10 minutes looking at the menu and then one of the employees came up to me and told me they could not serve us because the chef \"was done cooking for the day.\" We drove 45 minutes just to come eat here, and the employees were rude and said there was nothing they could do. Also, if that was the case the 10 minutes we were deciding on a burger they could have told us they could not serve us."}
{"text":"Bun was stale, and I didn't realize  I wasn't given dip for sweet potato fries I asked for until I got home :("}
{"text":"I wanted to try their vegetarian so I gave their AK-Veggie7 burger a try. It had soy-based vegan patty, grilled mushrooms, guac, lettuce, and tomato. I wasn't a huge fan of the taste of the patty, the texture of it reminded me of a gardein burger, but it didn't have much of a memorable taste. The guac was a little sour, but I didn't mind it overall. I think the highlight of the burger for me was probably the bun. The cost is on par with other burger joints like Burger's Priest, P&L, etc. My burger cost must almost $8 after tax. 

I'll definitely have to try their other vegetarian burger, but unfortunately my first experience with Burgernator did not leave a great impression. Their sides do sound amazing though, so I might have to try those next time!"}
{"text":"There's so many burger joints around, but Burgernator has quickly become my go-to.  Compares to Holy Chuck pretty well, but not quite as wet and greasy, yet still a tiny soak of juicy goodness at the bottom of your plate by the time you're done.

Also, the fries (and particularly the dipping sauce that comes with the fries) are just phenomenal."}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious, super juicy halal burgers! It really can't get any better than this! I have nothing negative to say about the food! My husband got double patty with the bbq sauce and I got the one with the boneless chicken strips on top of the patty. It was literally the best of both worlds!

The fries were okay. They tasted good, but we literally got the tiniest pieces of fries basically the end portion from a bag with maybe a few normal sized ones it was a little bit disappointing and my husband said it was maybe because we gave a really small tip that they just gave us a shit portion of the fries? To which I said I don't have to give tip when I'm ordering at the counter and there is absolutely nothing being provided to me besides someone bringing out the food which I could even go up to the counter and pick up myself if you call my number.

Between my husbands burger and my own including fries and two drinks we spent over $30...that does seem a bit steep!

Overall I loved the burger and will be back.

Service was great everything was fast it was nice that they had cards against humanity to play while you wait and then it was in an OK location with parking nearby"}
{"text":"Best burger place in the entire GTA, my favourite item on their menu is the Atomic burger. Burgers are so fresh! the patty is moist, soft and just cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this item to all you cheese lovers. The heavenly fried cheese patty in this burger is like a party in the mouth!..*drool*. Best thing is the owner/head chef loves what he does and puts his heart and soul into it! God bless him!

Good thing I live far or I would be there everyday!!"}
{"text":"Will not recommend it to my worst enemy!!! There was lots of confusion about the order with the people beside us !!!! I Waited 45 min for my order to come! All the table got theirs except me! And when I had it guess what the burger was burned it looked black! So I went to the server and they attempted to change it! I wanted to make sure they remember that I don't want tomato went to the server and reminded her! Yup got the order with a huge tomato in the middle!!!!! They did not even apologize!!! I refused to take the order and took my money and the serving charges back! They deserve no stars. The floor was covered with napkins the staff numbers exceeded the costumers and yet they failed to deliver the orders in time!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Dirty place. See pics of washroom. With how busy they are. They need to hire an extra person for clean up duty."}
{"text":"It's nothing special. Their buns were dry, which threw everything else off.

I would rather eat at Harvey's. Not that there's anything wrong with Harvey's, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. But I would go out of my way for Burger's Priest or Holy Chuck. 

There are so many burger joints these days that you'd better bring your A game if you want to compete."}
{"text":"Burger Priest (owners and fans) - pay attention: THIS is how it's done!!!

Perfectly cooked beef and lamb burgers. Juicy, great seasonings with outstanding attention to flavour and texture combinations with the toppings. A perfect, flavourful bun that hold up to the burger and toppings without overwhelming the flavour of the fresh ground meat. 

Great fries; fresh cut, lightly seasoned and served with a brilliant aoili.

Finally, the staff genuinely believes in their food and cares that you enjoy it. They are as emotionally invested in the food as are people who really care about quality and originality.

The words on the wall as you leave say it all: \"You'll be back!\" Yes we will!!!"}
{"text":"PREPARE FOR THE BURGERNATOR. Two buns wrapped around a deliciously hand chopped meat filling with a slice of fresh crunchy lettuce a fat juicy tomato slice, pickles and other fillings of your choice. PEW PEW PEW wicked mayo sauces and extremely greasy oil all attacked this delicious burger. Mmmm, what a fattening day.

Okay, so we came here as a last minute decision. Entering in, it was extremely spacious. You order in the front and decide where you sit while they bring you your order, but you clean up your trays at the end.

If you're as blind as me, the menu is on the right side on the wall. I literally kept staring into the kitchen for a good minute thinking I was sherlock holmes deciphering where the secret menu was. They have massive burgers, or they have tiny 4 oz burgers for people like me who like the plain old bun with minimal fillings and small in size. Of course, you can make it a combo for an extra $3! In addition, you can add a selection of sides!

The bun was toasted lightly, though I would prefer it more if it was toasted SLIGHTLY more. In addition, the meat was DELIGHTFUL, delightfully greasy. Hey, all greasy things are what makes it delicious right? My burger wasn't dripping too much, but my friend's burgers made it look like a waterfall when they ate. Minus a little bit of grease and HOLA FIVE STAR BURGER."}
{"text":"Short summary: Fantastic burgers. Hippy environment. Have been here several times and loved it each time!

They serve halal meat which a huge plus!"}
{"text":"\"Meh.\"

Chicken was undercooked and pink. Small snack sized sandwich for $10, and it's not free range chicken? Nah, player."}
{"text":"Won't be back.
Found this place last year and could not wait to come back - big mistake. Started with girl who took our order; after $100 the girl was rude and not helpful at all. The food was mediocre, the guy who delivered it to our table after a 25 min. Wait was rude.. I came for halal; will never come back and I urge all to take care.."}
{"text":"Very very good! We walked around Kensington Market for awhile and got hungry first. I hoped to convince my companions to get the signature burger with me but couldn't...damn. 

So I had a commander burger, a single patty with cheese. I have to say, the meat is so very good, with just the right amount of carmelization to bring out the excellent flavor. The bun is yellow, from egg and butter I think, flavorful and fresh. 

The onion rings were some of the best our friend has ever had. The salted Carmel shake was also great!  My poutine was all I hoped - I love poutine and as my FIRST Canadian poutine, it was great.

Only regret is that we aren't from here, I'd come back every week at least. When traveling one tends to pick and choose for convenience, and we didn't really like the uber boho neighborhood - but suck that up and come here for a burger that's sure to make your personal \"one of the best I've ever had\" list."}
{"text":"Their burgers are delicious! The patties are juicy and seasoned perfectly, the toppings are creative (and at times almost outrageous), and the decor is pretty amusing. 

I only have two complaints - they need to use better buns because the ones they use now can't handle the juiciness of the burger, and they need to work on streamlining their service. There's often a state of confusion at the cash register. 

Tip for students - they don't advertise it, but ask for their student discount. 

And for Muslims, they use Halal meat so you can eat worry-free =D"}
{"text":"I had recently read a review on BlogTO and decided to try it today with my boyfriend. The place looks very clean, the decor is welcoming and the owners were very nice. The menu was interesting and diverse, yet not too expensive, so it took us a while to decide!

In the end we got the sergeant burger and poutine. The burger looked good and was very tasty. I found the poutine a bit too salty, but it was tasty as well. 

We were both satisfied with our meal. I think next time I might try the burgernator fries instead and/or a more adventurous burger!"}
{"text":"\"Commander\" burger: classic beef burger.
\"Battle fields\": herb and cheese stuffed, crusted portobello mushroom burger.
The burgers were fantastic. The Commander was the epitome of burgers. When I crave a burger, I crave the Commander. The Battle Fields burger was literally melt-in-your-mouth cheesy crusted mushroom deliciousness. As for the fries, that's what fries are supposed to be like. Hand-cut, salted. Nothing more. Nothing less. Any time I want a burger, I'm going to the Burgernator."}
{"text":"Came here on a last minute decision, saw it before while strolling in Kensington but never had intention of trying just because I rarely crave burgers. We came here because we wanted something quick. The location is spacious with lots of seating, the kitchen is open for you to look in. We ordered 2 burgers (1 spicy burger and 1 burger that had a fried egg on it-do not remember the names sorry!) We also ordered a poutine and a drink. The price was a bit high for the burgers but comparable to other pricey burger chains. Food took around 10-15 mins I feel, and I already noticed that the gravy was not hot enough to melt the cheese on the poutine. My burger was a mess, as expected with a fried sunny side up egg on it. My BFs burger was really messy and fell apart due to the hot sauce and the 2 patties. I can't really say I tasted much flavour in my burger, I can definitely say it was salty...and that is about it. I did not find munch stand out flavour to mine. My BFs burger was really spicy...that is all I found him to really say. The poutine was okay nothing mind blowing. I can't say that I would come back but worth a try if you're craving burgers in the Kensington area."}
{"text":"I can't take it their burgers are awesome! If you love burgers and if you live in Toronto dear friends look no further! I am so jealous that I couldn't find a burger spot as good as burgernator in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  or halal burger place as good as them in New York I can't forget about these burgers like OH MY GOD! Take me to Toronto please! By the way me and my husband had the bazooka burger and the other one was the Big Bang it was out of this world! Starting from the buns to the meat you know everything is freshly made because it all falls apart it juicy not dry neither chewy it's all good! The ambience is lovely please do try these amazing burgers if your in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Best Burger in town. Wow, was f√ºr ein ccoler Laden und was f√ºr ein klasse Burger. Dazu noch die Pommes. Sehr empfehlenswert. Der Preis ist auch noch top. Also ab zum Kensington Market."}
{"text":"A solid three stars.

The Burgernator is one of many new burger joints that have been flooding Hogtown, with a little twist: It's Halal! So Muslims can get in on the crazy too.

Walked in, and the decor was minimal. They had their mantra or whatever on the wall, pretty cool and the menu was on the wall as well.

I had the big bang, and my friends had the little sargeant burger and the special lamb burger of the week.


My burger had:
The 6oz Patty
Chicken Strips
Mayo
Lettuce
Tomatoes
+added Jalapenos


The taste was okay, the mayo was dripping all over my face and hands.  The chicken was a bit much I think. Calm down guys. The patty was burnt on the outside, but perfect on the inside. I wasn't a fan of the quality of lettuce. I just got the gnarly pieces I guess. And it was probably the messiest burger I've ever eaten. Not a bad thing I guess.

It's an okay place, it's great for people who only eat halal to get in on the craze. 

My bill came up to like 13 dollars, for the burger and the pop"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait (its a fresh made to order burger waiting longer than the golden arches is the point) adequate seating  (if your not a huge group) amd a ton of choices both in their combos or to customize it. Various sizes of patties as well for those who may want a slightly smaller or hey way bigger choice.
I had the lamb burger mission of the week. Super tasty with goat cheese, saut√©ed onikn, mushrooms, garlic aoili superior bun definitely makes a difference as does quality lettuce and tomato.  
The fries were ok, redemption in the form of more aioli but honestly the burger is so good it doesn't matter. 
Great people watching as well if you choose a window stool, as you can see the market crowds wandering while you enjoy your burger!"}
{"text":"One word: juicy.

I think I'll let my picture do the talking.

I don't live near so have only been here once, but will happily come back."}
{"text":"Would I go back? Nope.

Absolutely polite wonderful guys behind the counter, neat clean little place. I'll take my mom here because it's halal.

But, the captain jerk didn't taste like it had any jerk anywhere near it, pineapple, what pineapple? And havarti cheese..... I love my havarti but couldn't find enough on the bun. 

I enjoyed the meal and the evening because we sat outside in the heat and chatted for hours, but the burger unfortunately won't be bringing me back. 

All the combinations seemed...off."}
{"text":"Best burger. Love their philosophy of using fresh local produce. I had the Bazooka Jr for a bit of heat. The homemade aoli is the best! All very filling!"}
{"text":"Loved the Burgernator, I got the \"Fully Loaded\" which comes with 2 6oz panties. I was hurting for a few hours after this one, You could feel the wait of the burger when they hand it to you.

It's 100% beef and you can tell. Found the toppings and sauce amazing also. We got the meal which came with fries that tasted like chip truck fries and a coke. Like most burger joints a little pricey but slightly less then average."}
{"text":"Tried the regular burger, The garlic taste gave it a good kick to the overall burger. 
The chili fries are a good side as well"}
{"text":"I ordered: Drop down and give me spicy, the explosion

(1/1) Price vs portion

(1.5/2) Taste + food presentation + drink (best to least)
Drop down and give me spicy:
+ every bite of the flavourful patty is a delight
+ no burnt fries
- need more veggies 

the explosion
+ perfect for group of 4

+ clean metal trays

(1/1)  ambiance + customer service
+ hipster downtown cool
+ clean
+ energetic owner/server

(0.5/1) Wow!
+ 0.5 ambiance: cool place for group"}
{"text":"I had been sort of so-so about Burgernator based on their veggie burger option, but my studiomate liked that they were halal, so we went fairly often. It wasn't until I was a Very Bad Vegetarian and ordered the seargent burger one night that I realized why this place is always hopping. Oh gosh. I'm sorry, cow. I'm so sorry, I know I'm not supposed to eat you. But I did eat you. And gosh. You were so good. 

If I succumb to weakness again, this is definitely where I'm going to do it."}
{"text":"honestly the best halal burger I've had! I had the atomic burger and it was absolutely delish. The meat was cooked perfectly and very flavourful. My friend had the Big Bang, I had a few bites of the chicken strip and it was also delicious! Service was quick and friendly and the restaurant was very full. Only complaint is that their hours are so short."}
{"text":"I ordered the commander burger aka cheese burger and fries I forgot what type of the fries they  were. The wait wasn't long I would say maybe 5-10 min for the food to come to our table.

The commander burger- it was nice and juicy fresh can tell meat was never frozen.. my burger was a little on the pink side and nobody else's was as pink as mine

The fries came loaded with cheese sauce, house jerk sauce and garlic sauce.. tasted like cheese sauce regular hot sauce and I didn't taste any garlic 

I would definitely go back to try another burger"}
{"text":"Went there again this weekend, the owner is still as cheerful as ever, and welcoming.
Needless to say that this is still my favourite bruger joint, yes \"After all this time\". 

Juicy-fresh-meat patties, innovative topping, nicely stacked buns, all contributes to a perfect burger experience.

They have different flavours catering to different taste buds, if you like your burgers sweet - try captain jerk, for spicy try drop-down and give me spicy.

My favourite is big-bang, because nothing can top chicken strips with beef patty!

If you are starving, you can go for the big one - the burgernator. You can finish it, don't let your diet hold you down from this meat goodness.

Fries have improved significantly since the last time i came, now they are pretty good, crispy and soft, non-greasy.

service is pretty fast, they are happy to give you more sauce if you need.

Go burgernate!"}
{"text":"The Burgernator is a fairly casual burger spot - you order at the counter and they bring you your burger or take-out, depending on if you're eating in or not. They have a fairly good selection of options (2 vegetarian ones only though) and sides to go along with them. 

The burgers themselves are delicious. Toasted bun, beef patties are juicy, toppings are cohesive and innovative, and the burger isn't overwhelming at the same time. Yes, they put a lot of different toppings and sauces inside, but it all works well together, which is where the magic comes in. 

I ordered the Fully Loaded and my friend ordered a Big Bang and we split an order of sweet potato fries. I think this definitely applies to eating most burgers, but given the sheer size and quantity of toppings in the burgers here, I'd caution you that it gets very messy, so be sure to have some tissues by your side. My Fully Loaded burger had toppings spilling out near the end and the fried egg was definitely a little messy to handle, but nonetheless phenomenal. The only minor issue was that the sweet potato fries seemed a little cold and not as crispy as I would have preferred, but the dipping for that was amazing. We'll definitely return to try the other burgers probably paired with different sides though."}
{"text":"Food - 5
Price - 4
Service - 4
Atmosphere - 2

The Burgernator is a small off the hook burger place located in the Kensington Market neighborhood.  We usually stay in the  Downtown Core as everything is within a mile or 2 from the core. And did I metion, that omg the burgers are amazing. They  are handmade. This is either the best or 2nd best burger in TO to me. We had the Fully Loaded and the Bazooka Jr and they were spectacular. The Burgernator sauce oozed off and was delicious. They definitely excel at burgers as the poutine was just okay. 

Their only downfall was the lack of ventilation. I don't want to smell like the food I'm eating, i just want to taste it. Its so smokey. Fix that and then theres really nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Original home-made burgers, with a good choice. Very casual fast-food place. However, the place could be very loud !"}
{"text":"Up and at 'em! No, up and atom!

I took up the challenge of trying The Burgernator. The $8.50 Atomic burger was... atomic? The whole thing held together cleanly with a nice and thick well-seasoned chuck patty, and... a deep fried slab of cheese? It was buttery and like eating fried battered fish at the same time. The 'Captain Jerk' with the grilled pineapple is amazing. The fries were perfectly crispy.

Behind the military/Arnold-themed business lies a caring family affair running the kitchen, and a whole line of fun burgers. Even their smaller and cheaper 4oz burgers delivers a carpet bomb of quality satisfaction that you can't go wrong with.

Yeah, I'll be back... to burgernate the $15 Burgernator stack someday. C'mon, it sounds like something to try once in a lifetime.

{TTC: the 506-er to Augusta.}"}
{"text":"I was really not impressed with the lack of common sense and the customer service here.  It was the first time I ordered a burger from them.  There was no one else there besides me and 3 staff at the back.  I paid for my order, assuming they would start making it.  I had some questions and she brought the chef to answer my questions.  He could not really tell me the ingredients in the veggie patty so I wasn't impressed but hey.  It seemed okay overally.  I was speaking to him, asking him why is it taking so long, 10 minutes later to make my order?  He said he didn't start making it yet. 

I was outraged.  I assume usually when you pay for food they start making it right away.  He told me he assumed I was not in a hurry.  I live in Toronto.  Of course I am in a hurry.   And apparently he is the only one out of the 3 staff in the back that actually cooks.  How difficult is it to make a burger.  Really poor communication and they didn't care I was getting late or wasting my time.  He even suggested to give me a refund, and I said, no I need my dinner.  Why wouldn't you start making an order once a customer pays?   And what were the 3 staff members doing back there if they weren't cooking.  

Either way, I don't recommend this place due to the poor customer service and lack of knowledge with their ingredients.  There are other places in Kensington that are way friendlier and better."}
{"text":"Burgers were very creative, staff was very friendly. Had the drop down and give me spicy, and I.T definitely lived up to its name. Nice flavor, spicy, but not over powering to where you can't enjoy I.T. The other burger we ordered (forget the name but it was a beef patty with chicken strips on top) was also very flavorful. Food wait time was about 10-15 minutes which was not bad at all."}
{"text":"Good fresh burgers with decent prices, place could be a bit more cleaner."}
{"text":"Juicy juicy beef patties. Delish! I tried the version with the Jerk sauce. Nice heat, but not over powering. I can't wait to try the other burgers.

The poutine is good... nice stringy cheese curds with real gravy"}
{"text":"Their burgers are great- probably one of my faves! My boyfriend and I always order the fully loaded burger (which usually comes with two beef patties but I could only take it with one). Their burgernator fries are amazing! Staff is friendly too. This place could get pretty packed and it's hard to find a seat at times. The only thing is that I always ask for my meat well-done and it came out undercooked a few times.... but still a great place in Kensington nonetheless."}
{"text":"YAYAYAYYAYAYAYA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my looooord. I'm going to try and be objective here but I'm so friggin excited for this place. 
Small and cozy burger joint in Kensington market. Everything is open concept so you can see the guy making your burger.

I got the burgenator fries - $5.50. They were pretty small...I was expecting a larger portion for some reason but it was definitely calorie heavy so once I got into it, I don't think I would have wanted a bigger portion. My eyes are usually bigger than my stomach...sighhhh.

Then I got the fully loaded burger. It was HUGE. DOUBLE BEEF PATTY, CHEDDAR CHEESE, FRIED EGG, SAUT√âED MUSHROOMS, CARAMELIZED ONIONS, TOMATO, LETTUCE & BURGERNATOR SAUCE (copied from their website, don't judge me. copyright etc etc).
So hard to eat dammit...there's an egg in there and it leaked everywhere. I was covered, pants and shirt and everything, with yolk. But i was most definitely ok with it. Just don't like....take a date here. You might change your mind about them when you see them covered in burger. But if you wanna take me here that's ok. I am ok with that.

Meat was nice and juicy, topping were perfect, everything worked out just lovely. I would definitely come back here. The only thing is the price. With all that and a drink I paid almost $20. But whatevz, it was worth a try!!!"}
{"text":"Went there during lunch time, during Burger Week. It was packed! Waited 40min to order a fully loaded and it was worth it!
The burger was huge! The patties (yeah there were 2, and a fried egg as well) were really good! I would just say that I couldn't really taste the toppings, because there was so much meat!

The cooks are quite fast and the cashier could have been a bit nicer, but I guess she was really busy!

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here per verbal assurance from staff and owner's are known Muslims. I had the Big Bang burger and it was great.  Has good sized beef patty topped with Chicken Strips and has the Burgernator sauce.  We also tried the Jerk Fries (since they ran out of Poutine), which was also very good.  Others in my party had the Chicken Burger, and it was OK.  Prices are a little on the high side, but they make the burgers fresh and overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"The burgers are made fresh and very juicy.... Best burger I've eve had. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was at The Burgernator last night, and my friend and I shared the Burgenator and fries. This was the most unbelievable burger I've ever had! Lots and lots of meat between two grilled cheese sandwiches - amazing goodness.

I would go here again, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Arrived 15 minutes prior to close. Arrived alone. Was told they were no longer serving people.  Even though I just followed a couple walking in.  I even told the person I would likely be fed and gone prior to their other customers. Still told no !  

Totally lame excuse.  The burgernator obviously terminated its customer service.  Well I just went John Conner and went to a place down the street !  Hasta la vista Burgernator !"}
{"text":"Okay so in my previous review I said I wouldn't come here again but I did because I was meeting up with a friend and he likes this place a lot god knows why. Anyway, I ordered their combo 4oz burger and got an upgrade to sweet potato fries; not the cheapest upgrade ever but whatever. So as I was eating, I rmbr why I didn't like this place - the bun is just bleh like Wendy's has better buns than them. But that's not why I'm giving them a one star. I hope you're not reading this as you're dining here lol. Anyway, I finished my burger and I got some sweet potato fries left and I was munching away and guess who decided to pay this place a visit? A mouse! It came out of nowhere! It ran to the kitchen and came back out the into the dining area near the heater by the wall and disappeared. Like everyone there freaked out. The staff didn't do anything about it! What?! Yup. So guess who's never ever coming back ever again? Yup, me."}
{"text":"So long story short... this burger doesn't qualify a \"great\" burger in my opinion. The concept of the burger is no different than the  plethora of places available from where I live (nyc). In my opinion, as a burger fiend, a great burger should be able to fit entirely in your mouth with an easy bite. When you have to pick up a burger wishing you had a third hand, and have stretch your mouth so wide only to bite into a small portion of the burger, than that aint no burger.

Burgers should be simple... easy to eat.. not all fancy.. for that reason.. I give this place 3 stars...
The quality of the burgers are good, customer service is awesome, the ambiance is definitely cool... but man... those monster size burgers are just not what I look for..."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with friends. The place is nice a unique. I really like the speed of the service it is very fast and efficient. The menu is written on the wall which is nice and unique. The place is halal so you can have the halal meat. I ordered the burger and fries with gravy. not a big fan of the gravy but the burger was good. I really liked the burger it is tasty. They put a lot of stuff in the burger which I was not a big fan of as it make it hard to taste the meat in the burger. The washrooms were clean and organized."}
{"text":"Ran into a random kensingtonian who raved about this place, convincing us to go.  Good burgers indeed, tasty onion rings and decent french fries.  

But please guys, hire a busboy!  Your tables are were covered in leftover garbage when I visited, the washrooms are on the gross side, and there was spittle all over the table outside."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. I usually don't eat hamburgers, but the burgernater is my exception."}
{"text":"Stopped in while wandering in the Kensington Markets. As the name states, there were lots of burger options to choose from on the menu. I got the Big Bang Burger, which is a burger with buffalo chicken strips. However, to be clear, the buffalo chicken strips are not in a buffalo sauce, they are just chicken tenders on the burger. The burger itself was flavorful, but was also incredibly greasy. I had to stop eating it after finishing about half because it was just too greasy."}
{"text":"I'm not a frequent eater of burgers, but I definitely enjoyed my experience at the Burgernator. The interior doesn't look all that enticing when you first enter, but the more I looked around the more I loved their decor, which followed a military theme. I ordered the \"Hasta La Vista, Birdie\" burger, and my favourite part was definitely the basil combined with the chicken breast. The only thing is the buns were a bit soggy. Service was really fast, and it wasn't busy as we went on a weekday for lunch. It's a great little place to visit in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Let's please stop the comparisons with Burger Priest. They have a similar menu but that's about it. The burger is not as good - the patty is a bit dry and the sauce was lacking. The portabello mushroom burger supposedly had guacamole but all I tasted was the cheese. Bit overwhelming. Its decent but it doesn't get close to BP."}
{"text":"The food was great, so was the service and I love the design and overall vibe of the restaurant.
Their manifesto is clearly proclaimed on the chalkboard-esque walls. Fresh and real food is their promise - and our meal was just that.
I went here with a couple of girlfriends while shopping in the market. 
The Jerk-inator (I may be paraphrasing/making that name up) was a spicy burger with a ring of grilled pineapple on top, that my friend really enjoyed.
I had the special- goat cheese and lamb burger! YUM I love lamb, and goatcheese, and this burger was a great combo.
My other friend had a classic burger, which she liked as well.
The fries are fresh and yummy!
Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Admittedly difficult to find this restuarant, but it is still in a nice little area for young adults to explore after eating here. The burgers are decently priced except for The Burgernator burger which is a whopping $17...but my boyfriend said it was worth it. We went late at night, around 9pm and it was very busy. Waited about 15 minutes for our orders and we struggled to find a table for two in the tiny dining space. The fries were amazing. I had The Commander burger which was pretty good for a 4 oz. The service was solid, they bring your order right to you so you don't have to get up, which we appreciated since it took us a good ten minutes to secure a seat. Overall, not the worst burger experience I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite burger joints in the city. Whenever I'm within walking distance of Kensington Market, I'll start craving a burger. The Atomic Burger is their take on a classic cheeseburger, with a beef patty, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. However, they do each element so well, that it blows every other cheeseburger I've had out of the water. The burger is cooked perfectly and oh so juicy, while full of beef flavour. The cheese is deliciously melted, and the herbs they chose complement it perfectly. Love this! Their fries are also very good, and I particularly like the aioli they make to dress the fries.

The star of Burgernator though, is their veggie burger Battle Fields. I'm not a vegetarian, but I'll still order this quite frequently because it's just so good. This is one of the places that has a cheese stuffed portobello \"burger\". The portobello burger itself is crusted and fried, so when you bite in you get a crunch, then the cheese oozes out. The cheese mixes in with the aioli and other sauces in the burger, and tastes simply divine.

The prices are a bit steep, but I'm willing to pay the extra bit because they make everything in-house and try to source their ingredients locally. I'm all about supporting local businesses!"}
{"text":"The Burgernator is an average burger place. I have eaten here a few times and some of the same issues recur

1. The interior is dark and uninspired. The chairs are uncomfortable.
2. Sides are extra, and $4.50 doesn't buy too many sweet potato fries.
3. The burgers are good, but sometimes the meat tastes unseasoned or they are too oozing with grease to stay together well.
4. The ordering process is slow. You stand in a line to order then wait for your number.
5. Some of the toppings don't work well with the burger. Perhaps in some instances pineapple is a good burger topping, but here it seems a bit forced.

If you want a cooked to order burger, this is an option that is probably a bit better than most chains, but also more expensive."}
{"text":"Great little burger place in Kensington Market. The veggie burger had great flavor and was hand made by what looked to be a wife/husband duo. Food came out quick and was filling.  Best burger I have had in Toronto.

Beware Yelp has an old menu; they no longer serve turkey burgers."}
{"text":"One of my favourite burger place. Atomic w/bacon and the captain jerk is my go to burger when I visit this establishment. The burgers are ground in house, the buns I believe are soft challah buns and the beef is cooked to perfection. I usually get the onion rings as well since the garlic dip is so addicting. 
If you love burgers, give this place a try!!! It doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Used to be the best burger I had in Toronto.went today..burger still okay but not the best anymore .bread tastes old ,burger lost that special meaty flavour that it used to have . What is wrong !!! I hope you make a come back ."}
{"text":"This is by far the best veggie burger I've had in Toronto, maybe even beating the ones that I had in Portland, now that's saying something. The location was pretty sweet, in the heart of Kensington Market.

Now the burger itself, it was decently priced. And it was the one with the guac. Man. It was delicious! I could not stop eating. The saut√©ed mushrooms, caramelized onions, the pickles, and the guac was a killer combo. The party was spy based, and there wasn't too much grease in the burger, so it wasn't really soggy. It definitely filled me up and it was fairly priced. 

The older gentleman at cash was really friendly. He was helping out a customer after me, and he'd ordered a pop, and he was gonna pay with debit. Since it was a hassle for the debit transaction, the owner slash older gentleman gave the pop for free. The customer was confused haha. He definitely gained a new future customer. 

Something to note might be that when I asked the dude, he told me that any of the \"meaty\" options could be substituted with a veggie patty, thus increasing the vegetarian options!! Overall, I loved the place and the ambiance of the restaurant was pretty awesome. I would definitely go there again and recommend anyone else to go there as well. To be honest, I liked it better than Burger's Priest. I feel Burger's Priest is a bit overrated, and price wise, not really bang for buck (at least for The Option)"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here after a game with Secret City TO that accumulated to about two hours of walking around Kensington. This place reminds me a bit of Burger Priest - fresh ingredients, variety of burgers, and delicious, except the portions here are way bigger! A bonus! We visited at around 9pm on a Saturday and there was a short line but service was quick and efficient. I would categorize the ambience as trendy grungey with black walls and steel/wood accented furniture. I had the Bazooka Jr. and the patty was perfectly cooked and juicy. The spicy aioli mixed with the fried egg, when ruptures, added a nice creamy texture to every bite. The perfectly toasted bun was also a good ratio (imo) to the other ingredients of the burger. I also shared the rocket fries with my boyfriend which was smothered in a variety of sauces - totally hit the spot! Price wise it was fairly consistent with other gourmet burger joints. All in all, Kensington is a gem to find good eats and I would not hesitate to recommend or return to the Burgernator!"}
{"text":"You don't need to be a halal fan to make this place your go-to burger joint. Burgernator is a great blend flawless fundamentals and off-the-wall creativity. My husband always selects from their more unique options, but personally I just find their simple cheeseburger to be sublime. The meat is excellent, and after eating here dozens of times, they've never disappointed."}
{"text":"Best burger joint I've tried in Toronto so far.

There are a wide variety of options and flavours in terms of the burger offerings. This isn't really a \"build your own burger\" type of place from what I can see, though they probably do allow for some minor customization of their preconfigured burgers. Rest assured that if you find an offering on the menu that sounds like it will suit your taste buds, it'll be good. Have some confidence in the people who came up with the menu!

The sides were on point - we tried both the fries and the sweet potato fries. Very good. I look forward to trying some of their more special sides next time. We also tried their deep fried Mars bar dessert served with some local vanilla ice cream. The Mars bar was nothing unique, you may have had something like it before, but the ice cream was amazing for a burger joint.

You might wonder how this compares to the Priest. I'd say this place beats them, hands down Quality of food is just as good if not better, but there are a lot more creative and varied flavours to choose from here. You get all this without the bizarre religious undertones, overwhelming lineup, gimmicky secret menu, AND with much better sides (the fries at the Priest have always been a weak link to me).

Service was friendly at the cash, no complaints there. There was ample seating for a weekday lunch but there was a point when there was a lineup in the restaurant and seating was fully taken. I can imagine during dinner and weekends this place could get pretty packed - but that's pretty much life in Toronto when it comes to any half-decent food joint."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. AND there's so much seating inside, which as you know basically never happens in Kensington market. My husband got the bulldozer and I both got the commander. Totally delicious. We also got fries and onion rings. The fries are good but if you're a fan of them you HAVE to get the onion rings, they're incredible. I loved the aioli too. The 4oz burger was more than enough for me, but if you're super hungry they have 6oz options. While we were in there a few people even ordered the Burgernator, which is HUUUUUUUGE. Not sure I love it that much, but I'll definitely be back for a normal burger soon!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best (halal) burger in the City.  The burgers themselves are never frozen, and hormone-free.  This is Kensington Market after all.  It's all fresh, organic, grass-fed beef.  

Make sure to try their signature burger topped with deep fried cheese (\"herbs crusted cheese\").  Wow :)

No matter how busy, your burger and fries (always fresh, never cold and stale!) come out within 5-10 mins.  Well worth the price.  

Cashier and server are very friendly and polite.

P.S. And, there's plenty of hot sauce available if you like your burger spicy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in back in October because we were looking for (cheap) good food in Kensington, and he was in the mood for burgers. I instantly fell in love with the place's decor, as simple as it is, because it's just so bold and beautiful. And the smells made us drool from the sidewalk, so we expected the food to be really, really good!

While standing in line, I noticed Arabic on the wall of the kitchen-- and then, I noticed that the place was halal. That made me so happy, because I know how difficult it is to find a halal burger place these days that makes good food at decent prices. The woman who took my order was polite, and she got down my order perfectly: a Captain Jerk and an Atomic. I went and sat down with my partner, and the food came round rather quickly considering it was lunch time.

The food was amazing! I wanted to try the jerk burger because the idea of pineapple on a hamburger seemed really cool, and it tasted great. The fries were also really good, and they were hot and crispy just like fries should be. The burger itself was juicy and flavourful, and I liked it way more than anything I've ever had at the Burger Priest. And compared to Burger Priest's prices, The Burgernator is killing it! AND the veg were all fresh, I could still hear the crunch of the lettuce. My boyfriend really liked his burger too, and we're both big fans of the Burgernator's special sauce-- they should bottle it and their jerk sauce, honestly. 

What sold me on this place, though, are the people who work there. While we were eating, two vision-impaired men walked in, and were struggling to find a bench to sit at since the layout is a bit different to other restaurants. Before I got up, one of the men working (the owner, I think) walked over and guided them to a table, and then stood there for several minutes reading out the menu to them, and taking the time to explain what was in everything and how it would be prepared. That's what Kensington Market is all about-- I'm glad we got to witness that, because I've seen too many ableist restaurant workers in Toronto. When my boyfriend and I got up to leave, the man came and said goodbye to me, remembered my name from when I placed my order, and told me to have a super nice day.. but in Arabic, and the message was just that much more special.

11/10 would go again. These guys are great, and their food is wonderful."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars because they had put so much salt in their patty that the burger was just not eatable. Great burger combination but the salt ruined the experience completely."}
{"text":"Great juicy burgers!
My friend and I tried Commander and the lamb burger. We both loved it, and the fries with a tint of spice in it. :)"}
{"text":"Not to happy with my meal from here. Got a veggie burger on a gluten free bun & fries. I got sick from the meal. It was not very yummy. I found the food to salty. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers.
Had the big bang combo, it was filling so great portions.
Place was clean.
I just didn't like how open and visible kitchen station was.
Food was fast."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times now. The burgers are amazing. They are worth your money. The only problem is that the place is very humid and hot....or may be its just hot Toronto summer!!"}
{"text":"great food and service.  Love the burgers, staff is alway courteous.  Washrooms need work and the seating area could be larger."}
{"text":"Great spot in Kensington Market. If you want a unique and tasty burger joint you have to check this out. The food is really fresh and the burgers are all made in house. Also it is really well priced and worth it if you're in a rush! Lastly, it has killer poutine that you have to try!! You gotta go here for the dopest food!"}
{"text":"Drop down and give spicy burger was life!!!! This little hole in the wall spot in kensington market is a must try for anyone."}
{"text":"Burgers are ok. Fries are ok. Aioli for the fries isn't that good. Veggie burger is fine. Toppings are tasteless and cold, but the pickles are good. Beef patty was crumbly. There are many great places in the market, this one is not a stand out. I would eat this burger again if someone gave me one."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants for burgers in my opinion. I'm really not a fan of the fries nonetheless still 5 stars !"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and the owner was very patient and helpful with our questions. We had the fries with rosemary garlic aioli and it was delicious! The burgers were super fresh and tastes great. No complaints at all! Wish I could have gone back again!"}
{"text":"There are many types of art -  classical, abstract, modern... The list goes on and on. One lost art, if you will, is the art of burger making. 

Enter Burginator. A hella local shop in the middle of Kensington Market who don't believe in freezing or using hormones to juice up the meat. It's all fresh. It's organic. It's grass-fed. 

But that's not all. Ensure you eat at the Burginator when the owner is there to cook (off peak hours he's often not there).

Ive tried almost every thing on the menu, and folks trust my yelp experience when I tell ya the Big Bang is what you are looking for. But stop right there, don't just settle for the Big Bang! You need to ask him to put on Canadian Beef Bacon, herbs crusted cheese, and an egg on top! The burger becomes so big it's almost inedible... However as you compress the burgers between your two hands and bring that burger into your mouth you will understand the true meaning of life. As your teeth slice through each layer (burger, lettuce, tomato, beef, chicken, bacon, egg, sauce, cheese, etc) your taste buds will instantaneously ask \"what have you been feeding me all your life.\" 

Eating this burger defies all logic. All boundaries are lost when your taste buds take over your emotions and you find yourself crying in happiness. This burger signals a renaissance to the current and future state of burgers."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and a very friendly staff. It's a good place to stay for hours if you're playing their Cards Against Humanity."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. I got the one with Chipotle and jalape√±o. It was perfectly cooked and the fries were also delicious. It was reasonably priced and the restaurant itself is cool on the inside. There are a lot of options that are also delicious"}
{"text":"It's a burger place.  They have burgers.  The meat is good.  The fries are eh.  The buns are decent.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Kensington Market to have a burger here, but I'd come here again to have another burger if I was already in Kensington Market and wanted a burger.

The burger is definitely the long suit - the meat hasn't been overly worked so it's nice and tender.  The pickles were waaaaaaay too salty.   I've had an ice tea, a fruit smoothie, water and 2 orange/tangerine drinks since I left (and I had a root beer there) and I still feel the effect of the salty pickle.

 I'd skip ordering a combo next time - the fries were a waste of effort. 

What puzzled me most (4 of us ordering separately, but eating together) was the seemingly random deposit of little white containers of sauce.  None of us asked for anything particular.    1 person got what seemed to be 2 different ketchups.  1 person got 1 ketchup and an aoili.  1 person got a ketchup and a vinegary sauce.  I got an aoili.  Random. 

The staff is generally fast and friendly.  

Women's washroom is pretty nasty - no change from the last couple of incarnations of this location.  It would be nice  to have a little attention paid to it.

~~~

If I was just rating the burger patty, it'd be a 5"}
{"text":"I had the Commander Burger. It was just ok for me, not jumping up and down.  The patty was good. It was juicy - but way too juicy (watery) to a point that it wet the bun so much and I had to eat it so fast.  I like the fries and that creamy dip that came with fries though.  I give food 2.5 but because the owner was so nice and friendly, I bumped it up to 3.  I may go back and will for try the specialty burgers."}
{"text":"I've been to The Burgernator twice in the last two weeks, and I'm adding it to my list of \"places to go to when I need to satisfy a very specific craving\". 

Their burgers are very tasty, and they're served unpretentiously in nice metal trays. I appreciate how they are made simply without any added fillers, so those of us who avoid gluten and eggs can enjoy them as well.

Their burger options are inventive and well-developed. I had a lamb burger with mango and jalapeno salsa on one visit, and a beef burger with avocado salsa, havarti and chipotle aioli (served on the side upon my request since I don't like mayo on burgers) the next time. Both times the burgers were very well cooked with that characteristic crust that you can only get with a properly flat-topped burger. 

The burgers are cooked to medium on request, and I would strongly recommend it. 
If ordered this way, they have an amazing crust on the exterior, and are exceptionally juicy and flavourful. The meat is very good quality, and they really celebrate this with their topping offerings. 

I can't comment on the quality of the bun, since I always order my burgers bunless/naked. I can say, however, that the interior of the burger is tasty enough that it doesn't NEED a bun. 

Since it's the dead of winter, the tomatoes and lettuce they garnish their burgers with are pretty sad looking (and are largely tasteless). I hope they switch to something more flavourful and local once better quality produce is available in the summer. 

As an aside, I also love how this place has decks of Cards Against Humanity available for play - it's a great way to fill the time while awaiting a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Exceptionally non-special. Bun far too large and far too bready for the patty. Fries limp. Portion of the excellent aioli microscopic. 

Pet peeve: US spelling on the \"this is our story\" art on the walls. \"Code of honor [sic],\" \"ice cream parlors [sic].\" You're in CANADA. Spell the shit right."}
{"text":"I stopped in and got the Lieutenant today with a side of onion rings. I am a huge burger fan and had been holding out to try a specific burger place, but didn't feel like travelling all the way there in crumby weather. I decided to drop in close to home at The Burgernator. I would definitely recommend to stay in vs. take-out. This way you can ensure that the bun is fully in tact - Wishful thinking had the best of me, I realize, as this is a potential reality when taking any burger to-go. The beef patties were good though, tasty, and flavourful which is important.

The onion rings were yummy, they had good flavour and crunch; I would consider the onion to batter ratio favourable as well. All in all there was much left to be desired for me... and if I am getting a burger to stay and eat I prefer a bit of a different atmosphere for sit and stay eating. I would recommend this place post-bar or, if you are with friends and not too concerned with ambiance. The burger hunt continues for me."}
{"text":"Fries are great... nice and crispy. Always comes with some sort of aioli which makes for a better dipping sauce than ketchup. Patties are great, never overcooked. Doesn't really compare to Holy Chuck but I'd say it's the best burger in the area."}
{"text":"I give this burger a \"meh\" on my scale of deliciousness. Seeing as they make their burgers from ground beef (as opposed to a frozen patty) they could have used a few more spices or something...... Anything!!!!!!!!! Way too bland!"}
{"text":"Burgernator is still a personal favourite halal burger joint but recently the service there has been a hit-and-miss experience. Sometimes when the order is taken, it is taken down to the precise kind of meat (medium rare or well done etc) along with spice level to make it as personalised as possible, while sometimes it is taken in a rush and the specifics ignored. 

My most recent experience there was unpleasant because I had specified the burger to be spicy and for no tomatoes (for health issues). Despite my constant repetition of the specification, the burger was dry, bland, and there were tomatoes. I was lucky enough to happen to open my burger to add sauce and notice the tomatoes.

My experience before this was amazing because they had provided extra chipotle aioli sauce in case we wanted to add more spices on top of the sauce in the burger.

I still love this place but I'm kind of scared whether my next experience will regain my love for this place or put me off completely.
My suggestion to the lovely owners is to make sure that those who take orders, especially for take-away, respect any special requests with regards to the orders made."}
{"text":"We had 2 burgers and some sweet potato fries here at a hot summer day. 
Burgers were ready after a short waiting period. Both were okay, but not extraordinarily good. It was really hot and loud inside so we left directly after we finished."}
{"text":"Veggie burger game too strong. Haven't had such a good veggie burger like the one they served me here in a while. 

Also the burgers my friend ordered looked pretty nice. Fair prices, nice ambience & delicious food. What more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"I think I'm addicted to burgernator. Easily one of the top 3 burgers I have ever had!  The patties are soo juicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"So. Very. Good!

The meat is really juicy and the sauces are perfect pairings. Never had a burger that I disliked from here. Have tried Fully Loaded, Big Bang, Baconator burgers (attached pic), and loved every single one. For the sides I'd recommend the poutine (their fries and onion rings were good but nothing special, and I didn't like the burgernator fries much - it has way too much sauce / flavor wasn't to my taste). Their milkshake was pretty delicious too!

Sure everything is a bit on the expensive side, and there's not too much in terms of service but you're still expected to tip (they were friendly but besides bringing you your food, everything else is self-serve - from grabbing napkins to clearing the table), I'm compelled to rate this 4.5 stars for their mouthwatering burgers alone."}
{"text":"I had the Big Bang Burger which comes with 2 patties, cheddar cheese, fried egg, mushrooms and caramelized onions. It says it came with some Burgernator sauces but I didn't really taste that. 

I really liked the authenticity and the freshness of the patty, it seems like it was made fresh right there on the spot. I didn't like how greasy and oily it was, there was literally a puddle of oil and the buns at the end were drenched with oil. The patty also fell apart multiple times and it was just a mess. Besides that it was not bad and I found the burger alright.

Also had some onion rings and they were average, but the sauce for it was pretty good. I think it was some mayo mix.

Maybe, I just had a bad experience ... but I'd like to come back and try a different burger and it may be a better experience next time."}
{"text":"I personally think this place is hands down one of the best burger places in the city! Always fresh, packed with flavour, decent prices. You won't be disappointed with any of they're menu items."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Had the 'Drop down and give me spicy' and it was amazing. Juicy double beef patty and the sauces were great too! Unique atmosphere as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is the best burger I've had in Kensington. Forget that, Toronto. Anybody knocking this place on here seems to be some faux restauranteur (sic). This place is not trying to win anyone with decor. They do themselves and they do it well. The dude who runs the place is ex military so please excuse the theme. It unapologetically serves no side salads and really it is up to you to decide if you can deal with it. If you can, I say you have made the decision to enjoy some prime beef burgers.
You can also see evidence of his career choices effecting one another as the place is run like clockwork. It's clean and the food is always super fresh, ground in house and sourced locally in Canada, hell from the local butcher is more like it. This is a stand-up Toronto establishment. Fuck all the haters, playa's gonna burgenate.  If you love Toronto you will eat this. Plus it's Halal so there is no pork in the building."}
{"text":"After scarfing down the whole 4oz commander burger with my onion rings this place is definitely getting five stars. 

You know food is good where no one is talking and eyes are to the hand to the burger to the mouth because you know if you miss a beat a crumb just might fall off the plate!!

And then comes the Explosion!!! Literally...
Dessert which consists of deep fried mars bar and is served with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce!!! Oh my G!!!

And hey if it's time for prayer, there is a prayer room downstairs... Make sure you thank the ONE above for this joint :-)"}
{"text":"I tried the Hasta la Vista Birdie, which is a chicken sandwich with guacamole, jalapenos, and jack cheese. I found the guacamole extremely bland and there were maybe 2 pieces of jalapeno on my burger. Although it wasn't bad - it wasn't great.

However, my friend the Big Bang burger, which was good. So I will be revisiting to try something (that is not chicken) on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious double party burger for $10 after tax. Maybe the 2 patties was a special for burger week because I ordered the same again and only got one. I got the Captain Jerk with jerk sauce, spicy havarti, lettuce, tomato and grilled pineapple. There was quite the lineup for burger week. I didn't know what the special was so I got what looked good to me (and it was great). You can see them grinding meat fresh. Great place!! Also glad to see they're open till 10 some days."}
{"text":"Let's just get this out of the way here - T.O's burger scene is finally delivering some damn fine options, and it's about time we catch up to the rest the world.

With all this happening, Burgernator sure does know how to throw down a burger. Soooooo good! Burgers are very personal thing though, and I can see why some of the reviews are less glowing as this one.

Had the Lieutenant, with a side of Chili fries. Patties were clearly made in-house, fat and juicy. Was it greasy? Hell yes! Yes folks, don't be scared. Fat=Juicy. The meat/fat ratio was spot on, and very well seasoned. Needless to say, I devoured it.

Chili fries were ok, but nothing to write about - I'd skip this next time. I do want to note though that I had some of my friends poutine, and it's amazeeeeballs! I'm not even a poutine guy, but the real cheese curds and gravy were top notch!

Might need to crank out a few sit-ups before I come back, but Burgernator, we will meet again."}
{"text":"I have had a lot of different halal burgers and I really have to say that this burger was the best I have ever had. I got the 

- Captain Jerk
- Drop Down and Give me Spicy
- Homecut fries 

All the ingredients are top notch, but what stands out the most is the patty. It's of exceptional quality and tastes amazing just by itself. Usually the extra toppings just overwhelm the meat flavor, but with the burgers I had, everything worked in complete harmony and the star was the meat. 

If you're from the US and know of Elevation or Burger7, know that this place blows both out of the water."}
{"text":"I had the special of the day which was a lamb burger. It was a good size, and every thing was decent quality. I was just surprised because the lamb didn't taste very lamby if you know what I mean. Lamb has a very distinct flavour & it didn't really come out in this burger. I wonder if they mixed it with other types of meat. The fries were good but not very plentiful. It ended up being a perfect sized meal for me. I was satisfied but not overly stuffed, nor was I left hungry. The burger's flavour just didn't blow me away. The food was good just not amazing. Next time I'm in the area I'll try a different burger. They do have a veggie burger for those who don't eat meat & they also have sweet potato fries.

Decor is pretty basic. The walls are black some are chalkboard & there are benches along one wall with tables & then chairs. There is a sort of bar type seating facing the window. It was pretty busy & the line up looked long when we arrived but the line moved quickly which was good. They also bring your order out to you instead of you having to stand there to pick it up. Seats were scarce so we I nabbed a couple stools by the window. But then a table opened up by the door & we sat there instead. Washrooms are downstairs in the basement & surprisingly clean even though it was the lunch time rush."}
{"text":"Everything here is HALAL including the cheese!!!

I usually don't  take statements like this lightly but, this is possibly one of the best burgers that I've ever had!!

 There's a lot of seating in this place and the menu is conveniently right across the wall so you can figure out what you want to order as you wait in line.

This is honestly the best burger I have ever had. I ordered the \"Drop down and give me spicy'. All the flavors included made for a mouthwatering combination.

The seasoning and the salt was perfect and the burger. The beef burger is ground beef melded together as it is freshly cooked. Therefore you can eat it with a fork at times as it slightly breaks apart in your burger. Yes, the burger patty is good enough to have on its own . It was crispy and soft at the same time. Beautiful. I enjoyed it.  

Based on the pictures of other people's burgers, I asked for it well done. It was well done and not overcooked at all. It was still very juicy and tasty.

Cost me like twelve dollars with tax but it was worth it for a treat.

 Have I convinced you yet? Try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Burgernator for the first time today and found my burger was extremely greasy, I found the veggies were fresh but the tomato \"slices\" were cut into cubes which began falling out of burger with every bite. The taste was great but in exchange for great taste I had a big mess left over in my wrapper. They had napkins that didn't come on my trey and when I got up to go over and get them I found they were really really thin, now I know what your saying they are only napkins but if your going to serve greasy burgers at least provide thicker paper napkins. It also doesn't help when the chef is standing at the cash register watching while you eat your meal, that didn't make me feel comfortable at all. Overall not bad just a hit and miss.  4 outta 10"}
{"text":"I consider myself a burger aficionado and this my friends, is the best burger I've ever had. I've had burgers all over North America and a few places in Europe, and this beats them all. I can write a very long review describing the incredible taste of each burger here, but simply put, you won't go wrong here. You'll cry when you're done because you'll want another one, and you'll be too full to have another. 
Go with the Captain Jerk, that's my favorite.
P.S. I secretly fly to Toronto from LA just for Burgernator."}
{"text":"Good fries.  A totally decent burger.  Maybe a little sloppy as juice dripped everywhere when I picked up the burger to take my first bite, but that's a small complaint.  The beef bacon was dope, and I liked the mayo that came with it too though I wanted more.  My only complaint is the place smelled a little funky like the floor was cleaned with a fusty old mop. But we arrived when it just opened, so I am willing to cut them some slack."}
{"text":"I had their $5 burger a couple of days ago for Burger Week and I absolutely loved it! It was unique because it had onion rings and had a spicy sauce that just made me devour the burger whole! I did visit when it was Big Chubby Burger and loved it then. So I'm glad that the new place lived up to the predecessor! Not to mention, you get the chance to play Cards Against Humanity! Burger and a game, who could say no to that?"}
{"text":"Great burgers and awesome service! You get a lot of beef for your money and the use of a nice metal tray that catches everything that falls out as you eat it. The place has a giant chalkboard menu on the wall and lots of seating."}
{"text":"So first off I have to say my husband really enjoyed his burger. But this isn't his Yelp account, so you know...here's my review.

Things I didn't like:

One, the restaurant is HOT! It was a scorcher of a Sunday and there were 5 people working in the open kitchen with no AC in the place. Well I think I saw an AC unit but it didn't seem to be making a dent in the heat. The place became unbearably stuffy pretty quickly. It doesn't take too long for a customer to eat a burger but I felt bad for the kitchen staff.

Two, my burger was smaller than the bun and that's my biggest burger pet peeve. Give me a smaller bun but don't you dare give me a smaller patty. Also, what's the deal with gristle in my burger? That was really unpleasant.

Things I did like:

Service was really good! The guy at the cash was pleasant and did me a solid by refilling my water bottle even though he was swamped. I really appreciated that on such a hot day. I also like that they bring your meal to you in a slightly informal, yell your name sort of way. I dig it.

Our milkshakes were yummy!

Sorry to the people who I flashed - dress + short girl + tall bar chairs = you will see my butt."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had yet. You can tell everything is made in house which is always a plus. The vegetarian 'battles field' burger makes me wanna go veggie. Jokes no way."}
{"text":"Hands down best vegan burger I've ever had in my life! The sweet potato fries were good too except I wish they were a bit less oily, my brother thought they tasted weird. The French fries were really awesome. The only negative I would say is that the seating area needs better ventilation because the whole place was filled with smoke. Overall I would def go here regularly."}
{"text":"I am a self proclaimed burger connoisseur and this place was better than I was expecting. I ordered just the regular cheeseburger and the chili cheese fries. The bun is probably the best part of the burger. That yellow type of bread, I don't know why it's yellow but it's always so good when buns look like that. My only issue with the burger itself is that they cook them medium-well and I prefer my burger cooked medium. The sauce they put on the burger is pretty good too. I enjoyed the chili cheese fries because they really loaded on the chili. Overall this is not the BEST burger in Toronto but if you're in the Kensington area it is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Burger and fries was good for me it's hard to impress me on burgers since I have tried so many places and it's hard to beat a few of them I've been too but all and all a nice place dosnt hurt to try."}
{"text":"Fries are very good, lamb burger was decent as well. Would come agaain to try to Burgernator challenge."}
{"text":"One of the well known burger places downtown, I came here with two of my friends and it was really humid. We all ordered The Big Bang and sat down while our order as being made. It was busy that day so it took us around ~30 minutes for our food to be ready. The people working there were really nice to bring the food to our table. We all ordered the combo, it came with fries (+ sauce) and a drink and overall, we enjoyed it very much. The egg was made sunny side up so the runny yolk made it delicious. Condiments were located at the table in the middle for extra saltiness. I am glad that I got to try this out and would come back to try their other burgers."}
{"text":"Good halal food with good prices and great staff. The burgers are good too as they are prepared by hand using quality ground beef, which is what I like to hear. Vegetarian options are available too but that does not apply to me. The dessert is good too, like the deep fried Mars. It tastes as if I am on Mars. The Fully Loaded burger is really good for those who are burger fanatics."}
{"text":"I liked the sauce on the Sergeant burger which also came as a dip for the onion rings but I found the meat rather flavourless. The onion rings were ok. I won't be hurrying back."}
{"text":"I recently had a traumatizing experience here which completely threw me off.

My boyfriend and I stopped in to pick up some burgers for lunch. He ordered the special of the day, some sort of beefy thing with cheese, avocado, refried beans and jalapeno salsa. Of the two veggie options on the menu -- one made with a soy patty and one with a portobello mushroom -- I opted for the \"AK-Veggie 7\". 

We ordered the burgers to go, being in a bit of a rush, and waited for what seemed like a lengthy amount of time before finally receiving a big paper bag with our food. I was starving and could hardly wait to get home and eat my burger. Turned out the burger boxes were mislabelled, and in my ravenous state I bit into what I THOUGHT was the veggie burger, only to discover it was meat. I then proceeded to alternate between throwing up violently and crying uncontrollably (fine, I threw up once and shed a couple of tears). Thank you, Burgernator, for providing me my first taste of meat in 10+ years -- against my will. Why even bother offering not just one, but TWO veggie options if your staff won't even take the time and consideration to label your boxes correctly?

Strangely enough, the other burger (what I assume is the REAL veggie burger) had a tiny dollop of guacamole on top, one tomato and several leaves of mixed greens, even though the menu advertises the AK-Veggie 7 as containing pickles. IN ADDITION, there were no refried beans in sight in the meat burger. What is truth and what is lies?!?

A call to The Burgernator only resulted in an apology and a promise to \"make it up to us next time\". What next time, Burgernator? I will never trust you again. This isn't a Rihanna/Chris Brown situation where I will go back to you after you hurt me. I'm calling it quits for good. To add further insult to injury, my boyfriend actually ended up going all the way back to get a refund for the food that we were no longer willing to eat. When he went back, the cook actually had the nerve to harass him and blame us for not checking the burgers ourselves, even though THEY were the ones who mislabelled the boxes. Awesome.

*UPDATE* I had a chance to connect with the owner, Amer, who was sincerely apologetic and lovely. While I don't hold this experience against him or the restaurant as a whole, it's a shame that there seems to be a certain level of disorganization in the kitchen. The burgers may taste great, for all I know!"}
{"text":"The Burgernator is a little restaurant with a big personality. Every detail about the restaurant, including the menu and its decor, all contribute to the theme of the place. It's quite neat, actually. 

Seems to be a busy place, with customers popping in quite frequently during lunch hours. 

The food is superb, most importantly. It's cooked fresh and right in front of you, which is a huge yes for me. My friends all enjoyed their meat burgers a lot! The veggie burger was not the best I have ever tasted, however, I could say that everything in the burger tasted fresh. Guac on the burger was great. The soy patty, however, was a bit on the cold side. If it weren't for that, this place would get 5 stars for me. But they're doing great! The Burgernator has made a cozy nest in Kensington! Would highly recommend. 

One more suggestion, oh sweet Burgernator: start offering some healthier drinks! Maybe some real fruit drinks? That would be awesome! :)"}
{"text":"Hasta la vista, Birdie! This was the name of the burger I inhaled in exactly 5 minutes. It was that good! The brioche bun was a balanced mix of salty and sweet, the chicken patty was juicy and paired well with the fresh tomatoes, saut√©ed mushrooms and sauce. It was definitely a healthier option on the menu. I've tried the atomic burger before (beef patty was great and is topped with fried cheese, so unique). I've been with a large group at lunch before and service is quite quick. Would love to try the fried portobello burger next time. Mmm..."}
{"text":"One of the better places I visited during my trip. :)

I love the vibe, it was hip and they played todays urban hip hop music (a lot of Drake, Canada REPRESENT! haha) and it was pretty low key inside.

I enjoyed the burger I got which is \"the commander burger\" it's $6 and has a 4oz beef patty, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, \"burgonator sauce\", and pickles. It didn't blow me away by any means but I was having a losing streak in Canada food wise so this was great compared to some of the other places I'd tried.

I like the vibe and I like the music, it fits with the rest of Kensington markets vibe and I'd come again to try one of the heartier burgers. Pretty good!"}
{"text":"If you want a nice, fat, juicy burger you gotta go here!  This place is taking part in the specialty burger craze that's storming the city AND they're definitely up there!
They are Halal and offer gluten-free buns so you can take out all those Muslim brothas and sistas or any friends with gluten allergies.  Additionally I got two words to add to your burger:  Beef Bacon.
Their burger patty is simple and delicious and is complemented by everything else that's added.  You'd think adding deep fried cheese to the Atomic Burger would make it greasy, but it's not that bad.
Go up, place your order, and wait.  It's quick and pretty efficient.  They also have games for you to play while you wait, like cards against humanity and apples to apples.  The place is pretty nice too and has a cute theme going on with their chalk board menu and metal trays.
Lastly, the price is relatively high but comparable to all the other burger joints that are found in the city."}
{"text":"First thought walking through the door of this establishment \"I feel the hipster vibes!\" 

Most certainly a modern burger joint with plenty of options and of course, we can ask for substitutes.
Fries come with a standard, yet strikingly delicious aioli for dipping! Ketchup and mustard are self serve, which is nice to add to your liking, and can be found in the center of the restaurant on a hanging table. 

Only complaint really is that the burger bun was much larger than the burger itself. The burger was just your \"average joe\".

Overall, cheapish hidden little gem in the midst of China Town (Kensington Market)!"}
{"text":"Kensington Market is filled with unique, independent restaurants, and The Burgernator is just one of them that serves up classic burgers. Their prices are very reasonable, and the highlight is definitely their hand-made patties. 

I ordered the Hasta La Vista, Birdie, which was a chicken burger with saut√©ed mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce, and a signature sauce. The chicken breast had a great grill flavor on it, but overall the burger wasn't particularly special. My boyfriend had the Fully Loaded, which came with two patties and a fried egg. The burger was piled so high, but if you get a bite of everything at once, the flavors come together really well. As I said before, you can really tell that their patties are hand-made! We also tried the poutine, which got a little soggy for our taste, but that's just the nature of poutine itself. This is definitely a good spot to come indulge a little, with dressed up burgers that are just borderline gourmet."}
{"text":"Om nom nom. One of the best, if not THE best burger I've ever had.

I got the Fully Loaded (2 patties, cheddar cheese, sunny-side up egg, sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions, lettuce, lettuce, and Burgernator sauce) with an extra patty and. Oh. My. God. Amazing. Everything was very flavourful and the patties were incredibly juicy.

A bit pricey, but definitely something I'm revisiting."}
{"text":"It's okay the sauce they give you with the fries is good but other then that it's all meh, it's a place you go once just to try it out, but you can really tell the food is fresh"}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews here I decided to make the ~30min trip there from my home and it was TOTALLY worth it.  Best halal burger joint in the city.  Big Moes was the best but is now second to Burgernator.  My cousin agrees too.  The burgers were made by the owners themselves, who are Muslim.  There are a lot of choices on the menu, and a bunch of toppings.  I had the burger that came with 2 6oz beef patties, a fried egg, sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions, tomato, lettuce, and burgernator sauce.  It was pretty massive, n messy (as expected) but enjoyable for me.  

My cousin had a burger with a 6oz beef patty, deep-fried herb crusted cheese, tomato, lettuce, with a sundried tomato aioli.  He started smiling after the first bite :) 

We also had the home-cut fries, which tasted fresh too.  

The burgers are pricier than Big Moes but you get what you pay for at Burgernator.  I will definitely make the trip back there again. 

Note for muslims: I originally stated they used alcohol on one of their toppings because it said 'beer' on it but the owner informed me that it was non-alcohol beer from Lebanon called Laziza.  Thanks for the clarification Amer!  And sorry for the late correction.. I thought I updated it but I must have forgotten to submit it."}
{"text":"My favourite burger and the best I've ever had! It feels home made, juicy and just melts in your mouth. The taste is on point. Anyone I've taken to try it loved it. It's definitely worth the trip you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Good burgers but kind of pricey. The staff here is great. I'm not sure if it's owned by a husband and wife but either way they're sweethearts

I've found that the burgers are always undercooked but I can see how some burger fans like that

Burgers are full of flavour no matter which one you get"}
{"text":"The best homemade burger in town - Period. The name of the place is cool too.

Take a bite off any of their burgers and enjoy the true taste of freshness. Same with the fries - they're good!

My only complain is that it's a bit loud so not very good for conversations but the burgers make it ALL worth it!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night because we were wandering around Kensington looking for a place for dinner and a burger joint is hard to pass up. I went for the regular cheeseburger but my friends went for some of the crazier creations. Everyone seemed to really enjoy the meal and they were going on about how good the fries were (I didn't have any). I did find the burger to be a bit greasy for my liking but otherwise the taste was good and the cost was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Kensington does a good job with food and not much can satisfy your cravings on cold winter days like this place. Burgernator offers halal and gluten free options, so good for people with dietary restrictions.

The atomic burger is amazing if you're a fan of cheese. Their onion rings and nice and crispy, and they have creative options to choose from, a refreshing take on burgers.

The best thing about this place, at least for me, is the patty. It's perfect beef patty which hits the spot if you're a meat lover!"}
{"text":"Nice spot for a delish burger and fries in Kensington market
However, its way too hot inside the restaurant in the middle of the summer. It's unbearable to sit inside to enjoy a burger on a hot sumer day. Burgers are not cheap here so I would expect some electric fans or AC to make it a more enjoyable dining experience. And I agree with another yeller, tables are dirty and don't get cleaned on a timely manner. 
Would definitely give it another star if the inside restaurant was more tidy and properly temperature."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger in Canada.

Whenever I am visiting from New York, I make sure to stop by for Big Bang. 

Amazing staff, and a burger so fresh, you would think that they slaughter their own meat right before serving it to you."}
{"text":"Super good place, I had the burgernator, onion rings a coke and a milkshake I will go again sometime! :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I did that thing where you walk around waiting far too long to get food so you finally force yourself to make a decision. 

This was not the worst burger I'd ever had. And I will say they have gluten free buns, so that was a total plus. 

However it just wasn't enough for me to write home about. 

The restaurant itself has some great art and some interesting style, but it's really cold and felt not super cosy. It lacked atmosphere to be concise. 

The burgers were what you'd expect to pay for something where there's no table service and you're eating a \"gourmet\" burger.

The service was okay, although a bit confusing. There seemed to be a bit of confusion in their kitchen. 

All in all, it wasn't the worst. Certainly if you're craving a burger it tasted good, had a good mix of different types of burgers and toppings, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have a burger here."}
{"text":"Great burgers! The place is good to sit and eat at with friends especially. Prices are average. Great options for food."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST!! No one can beat burgernator! BEST BURGER I've ever had! The people who work there are really nice and it is run by Muslims - burgers are halal. Really great place! Delicious food. Still dream about it"}
{"text":"I've been to Burgernator twice and both times the food was impressive. I judge a good burger based on the patty and this place serves very juicy and flavorful patties. Everything I've tried so far has been excellent. The service is great too. Will definitely be going there again!"}
{"text":"Tried The Big Bang burger and Burgernator fries.

The burger was okay, and the chicken strips were crispy. However, I felt it was lacking salt or some sort of flavour - found it pretty bland. The fries were okay as well, but they seemed too soggy for my taste. Never had chili cheese fries, so can't compare it to any other places. 

Found it to be pretty pricey for food that was \"okay.\""}
{"text":"Edit: After my initial experience I'm pleased to say my 3rd experience was much much better than my first two. 

It is a new creative burger joint in Kensington Market. The menu is wild and well worth trying. I also really like the management 

Two notes: 1. It's a Hipster joint 2. Make sure you let the cashier know how you want your burger done."}
