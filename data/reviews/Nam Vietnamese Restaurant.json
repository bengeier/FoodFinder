{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant in the summer shortly after they opened as we live on the area. Since then it's been our go-to for viet food. Our top picks:    1. Pork chop rice - the  chops are thick and juicy (not thin and dried out like at other viet joints). It's a huge portion with 2 large chops and super flavourful.  2. Avocado shakes - rich and creamy but not too sweet 3. Classic pho - hot and fresh with a good broth sans MSG that tends to linger.   Family run restaurant that is super friendly. They get packed during weekday lunch rush so go early for a table. Closed Mondays and takeout avail."}
{"text":"It's a nice little place. Clean and neat so far. Appreciate the open kitchen. Hopefully they'll keep it up, as sanitation of a lot of Asian restaurant deteriorates rather quickly.   Been here twice. Had pho last time. It's okay. The taste of soup and the quality of beef were good. However, the beef balls were too soft and the texture of noodles were too starchy to my liking.   Had Banh mi with 5 spice pork belly this time. That was impressive. Love their baguette. Crust is crunchy, inside is soft and warm. The pork is tasty and goes well with the garnishes. We also ordered the beef stew in tomato sauce. The taste was good, but it looks more like a tomato soup than sauce.    The surprise was the avocado smoothie. Not only the presentation was impressive, it tasted good too. Not too sweet, but refreshing.   Service was friendly. They also have daily specials. Will go back to try their rice next time.   Overall, to be able to find a clean and okay Vietnamese restaurant in Richmond Hill is something we locals should appreciate."}
{"text":"Don't think this place is authentic Vietnamese restaurant, at least not for pho. The portion is fairly small and the soup from the pho is tasteless..... in comparison I would rather go to vip pho in fmp."}
{"text":"Having a Vietnamese mom I know what is authentic pho, and Nam is legit!  The pho broth was great, not too salty or taste like MSG.  We tried the fried chicken wings and I could probably eat a dozen, don't forget to grab a banh mi to go.  Staff were very quick and nice.  This spot reminds me of a hip downtown spot but located uptown!  The Will come back again."}
{"text":"Review of a Restaurant Without Even Tasting the Food  My wife and I wanted to try this new restaurant just to see what our options were in the area. Upon arriving at the restaurant at approximately 6:20pm on a weeknight, the door was locked. However, there were several tables inside the restaurant eating. Not full. Three to four tables were occupied. We tried opening the door as it was locked. No signs whatsoever indicating why it was locked. People inside were looking at us. Even the staff inside were looking at us. No one came to the door.  So I grabbed the staff's attention from outside and pointed at the door. Finally one lady came to the door, unlocked it and told us \"The restaurant is booked for a private sitting at 7:00pm\". It's fine if your restaurant is booked. But give us the option of eating and leaving within half an hour's time as your restaurant is not full. We arrived 40 minutes before the private sitting even began. It would be our choice to leave if we knew we couldn't finish within the time allotted. But to totally ignore us while we were standing outside the restaurant with no indication as to why you're closing your doors, that's unheard of.   A little sign on the front door would have helped. What a way to shoo away new customers. Won't be trying this place at all as it's true from what other reviews have mentioned: service is horrendous. I'll be taking my Pho cravings elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese places in Richmond Hill!! Very nicely decorated inside. The food was fantastic, especially the 5 spicy pork belly banh mi. It was nicely seasoned with a soft bun. We also ordered the rare beef, tripe, tendon noodle (#35 on the menu), it was average but the soup was very nice.  The downside to this restaurant is the staff, it was very slow and very hard to understand the waitresses. Very hard to get their attention during busy times.  But will still be going back :) (maybe at a less busy time)"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my coworkers, but sadly only a few of us actually got our orders filled after 1 hour wait. Majority were orders for Pho, I didn't know they were cooking it from scratch! I know they just opened, but when you see take-out customer orders getting filled before yours after an hour wait you have to wonder how you can justify giving this place a tip or a good review. I ordered the chicken pad thai and to be honest, it was nothing particularly outstanding. A few people received their pho said it was okay, but also not worth one hour wait. I'm not sure if I would go back, it's not like Richmond Hill is lacking for Vietnamese restaurants so unless there is something outstanding on their menu I will try my luck elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there late afternoon today. When we got in, the staff were just finishing their meals after the lunch hour rush, I guess.  So this young man, seemingly not pleased being interrupted, came by with the menu and a pot of lukewarm tea. I ordered \"Beef Stew Banh Mi\" with baguette and my wife ordered \"chicken in noodle soup\"(Pho Ga). Two minutes later, he came back and told me that they didn't do beef stew today. I was caught by surprise! It is supposed to be a staple item on their menu and is nothing special about it!  Then he stood there waiting for me to order another item, rather than suggesting something similar.  So I asked him which one is tomato based noodle soup. He said #31, spicy beef and ham noodle soup (Bun bo hue). Somewhat skeptical but ordered it anyway. When he brought it over, i tasted very spicy hot soup. It was good but no trace of tomato. While I could take spicy food, it was not fair to the customer who wanted just a mild noodle soup. Also, the chicken in Pho Ga didn't taste very fresh either.  We asked for cooked bean sprouts. He brought over a plate of bean sprouts which were still raw but evidently had had a bit of hot water run over them. Honestly, I would not go back to a place which does not respect their customers, no matter how good their food is!   PS. To be fair, the young lady who later served us after him was way way better, more polite, pleasant and customer oriented."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends who are originally from Vancouver and they have deemed it to be a close second of the popular Phnom Penh in Vancouver (with even better crispy wings with lime sauce).  We ordered:  -grilled Vietnamese pork sausages (5/5):this was a fun dish to eat as it came with rice paper and toppings which allowed you to assemble your own wrap   -butter beef rice (5/5): the rice wine flavour is quite prevalent in this dish however I thought it added depth to the flavour of the dish, comes with a sunny side up egg  -dry crispy chicken wings (5/5): everyone at the table loved these wings and thought that it was perfectly seasoned inside and out, is dressed with bits of onions and green peppers  -Phnom Penh style dry noodle (3/5): came with a delicious bowl of soup on the side, while I enjoyed how the noodles were dressed (reminiscent of Taiwanese yi mian) I personally was not a fan of all of the ingredients in the bowl. While I am typically a fan of innards, the gizzard? In the noodle was very tough and gamey   -Pho (3/5): wouldn't recommend coming here for pho as nothing about it stands out   All in all will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant - limited seating, in Richmond Hill.  Very basic.  The menu is limited.  We had the beef sandwich which was tasty.  We also had the soup - 3 types.  They were all good, broth flavour was good.  The serving sizes and ingredients were a good amount.  Prices reasonable.  I will return."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on second day it opened. While staff were still trying to get their orders straight, they were pleasant and courteous.  First, about the restaurant. It's a small restaurant with open concept kitchen. (Yay! Since you can see if they handle food properly). Decor is reminiscent of war time Vietnam with washes of army green, grey,etc mixed with kitschy wooden tables and rustic steel chairs. Typical design of many Leslieville restaurant. It's clean. Run by a younger generation that speaks English. Menu is simple with ample selection that doesn't overwhelm.  Now about the food: unfortunately I have to say it's just ok. And sadly nothing more.  I ordered lemongrass pork chop with ground pork omelette. The pork chops lacked lemongrass flavour. The omelette was a bit sad. We also ordered pho which was ok.  Five spice pork belly banh mi was on the dry side and lacked that punch to make it worth $5-6.  Spring rolls and cold shrimp rolls were standard.  I saw other tables order smoothies that looked outstanding. Looked more like margaritas or bellinis. I need to try that next time.  To sum it up, nice, friendly little place to drop in for Vietnamese if you want a clean environment but willingly to settle for mediocre food.  I'm hoping they will kick it up a notch so this place can become an all time favourite!"}
{"text":"So glad I discovered this Vietnamese gem. We had a great dinner experience and will definitely be back to try more dishes.  Food: Tastes great and very fresh. We ordered the signature pho noodles and pork rice dish. Great portion size for the price. The broth for the pho was flavourful with minimal msg.  If there were a bit more toppings, it would be nice. The pork rice dish was great value. It pork was so good, made you want more.   Service/decor: Relaxed setting.  They do check up on you to see if you need more tea or anything. Service can be slow but they don't rush you even if you're done.   Tip: on weekdays, usually last call for food is 8:30pm. First time we went at 8:35 and kitchen was closed already. So if you ever go in late, call ahead."}
{"text":"The broth. The delicious broth.   This Vietnamese place is probably one of my favourites. The prices are little higher than other Vietnamese restaurants but it's worth it.   I ordered the Beef stew with rice noodles and my BF ordered regular pho. The stew was very tasty, but the only thing they could have done to make it even better was to reduce the amount of star anise. Portion sizes are decent. I was unable to finish my bowl.   Wanted to order shrimp chips as well but they were out. Ended up getting fresh rolls as an appetizer instead. The rolls were filled to perfection. The proportion of vermicelli to meat to lettuce was just the right amount.   Highly recommend this place for vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"This place gets really busy at night...came here with a friend for dinner. We were both disappointed that a couple of the items were sold out for the night (even though their menu is pretty limited). I had the beef stew with noodles which was pretty delicious. We also shared the shrimp chips - they get a bit heavy but still delicious."}
{"text":"Nit the most comfortable place to sit in, but they have a variety of pho choices i personally like their smoothes the most, although a bit more expensive but their flavor is very rich."}
{"text":"The waitress forgot to bring us the bean sprout for the pho, forgot the egg on top of the rice, and the soup for the pho tasted below average. This restaurant is not authentic Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Delcious and authentic Viet food. I have tried the Banh Mi Bo (braised brisket sandwich), spring roll platter (both types of spring rolls, soft kind needs to be wrapped by yourself), and tomato sauce braised brisket noodle. Their Banh Mi sandwich was pretty good, flavorful, well marinated, juicy, generous on the sauce (siracha mayo and hoisin sauce). It gets a little messy though. The soft spring rolls, cool that you get to make your own, but pretty messy as well. I prefer the fried ones. Tomato sauce braised brisket noodle is pretty amazing, made with tomato paste that is not so sour or sweet but salty, not watery at all. Braised brisket is so tender and full of flavor. All their food comes in good portion. The only thing I don't really like about the place is how small and crowded it is. You share table with strangers and the seatings are not comfortable. If you go after 6:30 p.m., the line-up is quite long. The service is lind of slow as well. If good food and fair price is all you care for, then go for it for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered spring rolls, chicken wings and bun rieu (seafood noodle soup) but without the crab. Spring rolls were pretty epic - crispy but chewy and filling had flavour. Wings were really crispy and sauce was good. Bun rieu was alright. They had all the things I loved in there, tomatoes, tofu, pork blood etc., but the broth was off. There was a sour note to it, more like a sour soup than a bun rieu, although I must say, the rieu part ( crab/pork/egg mixture) was amazing!  Also tried my friends crab that came with her bun rieu and was kicking myself for not ordering the same.  I'd come back again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"The spring rolls here are THE BEST. Very crispy and I've very tasted anything like it! It's a must order!   The broth for the pho is very unique. Unlike other Vietnamese restaurants, the broth here is very tasty indeed and can clearly taste there is no msg.   Grilled chicken on rice vermicelli salad bowl. The vermicelli used is very different. Not too thin, but not the thick type either. Never had any vermicelli like it.  The pad thai like any other pad thai, is pretty average.   Also tried the curry, nothing very special about it. Very watery and not much meat in it. I found half a tomato in the curry which took up half the space.   The portions are very tiny, not very full even when ordering 5 meals for 4 people. Very tiny restaurant with a very long wait for a table. I think the only thing that makes this place 4 stars is the spring rolls and the broth."}
{"text":"Came here with a group based on a friend's recommendation. I was very impressed walking in because the decor was very different from other Viet restaurant uptown. It has a cool dt feel to it.  With that said, their prices are very reasonable and portions are great. It's such good value for the service and atmosphere you're in. I think this has become my go to Viet place.  I've passed this plaza so many times and have never gone into this restaurant. I didn't even know it existed. You'll be pleasantly surprised :)  We got a desert to share and it was so good!!! There was fried rice kripsies inside the ice cream and so many different flavors. :)"}
{"text":"Was craving for a Banh Mi but there wasn't any stores that make it fresh in my vicinity. Yelp search brough up this restaurant near me so decided to come for a try.  5 Spice Pork Banh Mi ($5.90) There were only 2 banh mis to choose from, 5 spoce porj or braised beef brisket. The banh mi is warm and bread is crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Could use more pickles and cilantro inside the bun as well rather than just topping on the top. Kinda clumsy to eat to get a bite of everything. The 5 spice pork is tender but not too much flavour. I was really craving for a traditional banh mi with the cold cuts and pate.  Dry chicken wings with lime sauce ($7.90) Hot and fresh, fried super crispy. Comes with 5 pieces. Smells of butter when served, but when you bite into it, it is not too greasy. Love the fried garlic and onion toppings but wish it would stick onto the wings more. I had to scoop it with a fork. Lime juice on the side brightens up the flavours.  Tip: Gets super busy with work folks around 12pm. Come earlier if you want to stop by for lunch."}
{"text":"2.75 with potential. Another lunch and another craving, so it's off to this relatively new restaurant to determine if it makes it onto the 'hey this is pretty good lets go here for lunch' list, or the 'holy moly this place is horrible and let's never return' list.  I would say that this is a pretty small restaurant, so if you're in a rush, it might not be the most swift. Luckily for us, a table had just left as we were walking in, so we were seated quickly. Someone in our group had heard that the Banh Mi here was good, so we decided to order two 5 spice pork belly banh mi to split between four of us.I also ordered a bowl of Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Beef and Ham Noodle Soup) with fresh noodles (you can also choose dry).  When the 5 Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi arrived, I was excited. The pork belly looked to be a fairly thick cut and the bun felt warm and soft, yet ever so slightly crusted (i.e. it was toasted). Then... my excitement evaporated when I bit into it. What I was expecting was a savoury flavour explosion, with my taste buds taken on a wild ride as I chewed through the fatty pork, pickled vegetables, and warm bun. Instead, what I got was an under seasoned piece of pork belly, which very much needed a gentle treatment of salt, in what otherwise would have been a quite tasty sandwich. This is a huge shame since everything else about the banh mi was right on.  So what about the Bun Bo Hue? In my opinion, this was a mixed bag. Even though this only came in one size, I thought that the size would have been perfect, had I not had the banh mi. There was a generous portion of beef, along with a respectably sized circle of ham. My main gripe with this dish as a whole, however, is that I couldn't get enough soup with each bite of noodles. Now yes, I understand that this sounds weird, considering that I had a giant bowl of soup in front of me, but let me try to explain. Typically when eating pho, it seems that the noodles \"pick up\" a lot of the flavour from the broth, so with each bite, you would receive noodles and broth (or at least the flavour of the broth). In this case, I'm not sure if it was the fresh noodles or the oil on the top of the soup, but when I took a bite of the noodles, I didn't get the soup... just noodles. I ended up having to supplement by manually spooning soup into my mouth. Yes, I know, it seems stupid, but truly this bothered me, especially considering that I found the soup itself quite flavourful and tasty. The noodles also have a nice texture/bite to them.  Prior to placing this place on a list, I think I'm going to wait a few months and try it again. Both things that I had were just so close to being really good, but both fell just short of convincing me."}
{"text":"My partner keeps ordering the daily featured noodle soup, which he says is very similar to the Vietnamese noodles he has with some Vietnamese family friends. I tend to go for classic pho, which I like for its broth that doesn't skimp on ingredients (you can actually taste some of the bone broth and spices). Also allows the option of dry or fresh noodles - apparently fresh noodles are a little bit wider. But maybe next time I'll try that shrimpy noodle, the bit I stole from my partner was pretty flavourful...   Also like the lime sauce crispy wings, which are about three flats and three drumettes with a side of clearish limey liquid with black pepper for dipping.   Super friendly staff. Even saw them letting customers in at 9:20pm despite having a closing time of 9:00pm closing hour displayed on the door.   Not many drinks available right now, but a couple of friends of mine have ordered the iced drip coffee and have given me conflicting info: one said it was super strong, while the other said it was very watered down. Saw the staff working with a huge jar of house-made salted limes, presumably for the salted lime soda to be made available in the future. Maybe it will be ready when I'm back again?"}
{"text":"Best soft shell crab pho EVER!!!  They also give you free authentic Thai iced tea if you check in on social media (and I know it's authentic because it's bright orange!!).  Their apps are also yummy - I loved the deep fried viet spring rolls and the lime fried chicken wings!  Quick service and cute space - albeit a bit small so make sure you come early or be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Passed by this restaurant on our way home and so decided to have dinner in this restaurant. The waitress is friendly and showed us how to eat the Beef Stew with baguette. The veggies  and the salad  on the side is refreshing but the stew if a hit salty to me. I can't finish the stew with one loaf of baguette. There are still plenty of meat  and sauce left. I remember this dish was not this salty last time when I had it in this restaurant.  Also the assorted meat with glass and egg noodles  is also on the salty side but not as much as the stew. Not very happy  with my meal  tonight. Hope to find something more interesting next time as I heard this restaurant has a good reputation of authentic Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"I came to Nam with decent expectations because it was recommended by a friend as new, local, and authentic Vietnamese food. My friend previously had a banh mi and love it.   To begin with, this is definitely a small restaurant with industrial decor and an open kitchen. I'm not sure if this is a one-off malfunction, but there is no air conditioning in this restaurant. There's a heat wave warning the past few days and there is almost zero ventilation in here. No explanation or apology from the waitresses about this, and the fans they've put around the place simply isn't enough.   The menu is relatively limited - the highly recommended banh mi is the only one of its kind on the menu. There is the usual pad thai and pho, but the heat and the lack of air conditioning turned me off from hot soup. Both pad thai and rice were just okay - pad thai was a little on the sweet side. Presentation is lacking, it really looks like someone slapped the food onto the plate. The banh mi is the only item we ordered that exceeded my expectation - the pork belly is a good texture and makes the entire bun seem so fresh.   Due to the heat, I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee. I'm disappointed to say that it's not a very good value - my entire glass, once it's finished dripping and poured into the glass with ice cubes, didn't come up to a full glass.   My experience was not too enjoyable due to the (unexplained) heat, and would give this one star but for the waitresses and staff who are all very young and energetic and all smiles.   Consider staying away during the summer months until they either install or fix their air conditioning."}
{"text":"Nam is a nice spot for a bowl of pho, but what impressed me was their Fried Chicken Wings in Nam Special Sauce.  Food: - Pho was good, broth not too fatty and medium was a generous portion size.  I tend to ask for cooked bean sprouts to go with my pho. - Chicken vermicelli with spring roll.  This dish was a bit basic compared to a few other viet restaurants.  Not a lot of chicken and the spring roll skin was different than expected.  My husband had the pork vermicelli on another occassion and says that dish is better. - Chicken wings are a must try.  Love the nam special sauce which is garlic based, and comes with some chopped onions and peppers as garnish.  Very yummy and large portion, 6 to 7 wings per order.  Ambience:  tastefully decorated and modern, but it is a small place and the seating is a bit crammed.  Expect to be sharing a large table with others, and gets fairly busy after 1pm on the weekend."}
{"text":"So good! One of the best pho resto in Markham.  The banh mi is sooooo good.  A very clean restaurant, not dirty like most pho restaurants.  Drinks still come out slow, but I notice most vietnamese restaurants, the drinks always come out super slow for some reason"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good pho joint and I daresay I've found it. Cute and quaint, nestled in the south west corner of Leslie and 16th Ave, Nam's is a big treat in a small plaza. I tried their fresh pork shrimp rolls, the added cucumber gave it a fresh zing. Next, I tried a Viet staple: the rare beef pho. I was pleasantly surprised to see real rare beef! Noodle texture was good and firm, broth was a bit underwhelming on the fragrant side, but still acceptable. Their staples are good, their selection is large and expanding, and the service was exceptional.  I had only come in once before to get a Viet iced coffee and the hostess remembered me a month later. All in all, the food is above average, and I can see a lot of potential. I definitely look forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"I really like this authentic Viet restaurant. My friends, fiancé and I always have a reason to come back. Their soup is flavourful, and their noodles are made pretty well. They give substantial meat in their dishes. The only thing that I would say needs to be changed would be the owner's attitude toward his employees. Sure, restaurant environments are stressful and fast pace, but from what I've observed, employees are hardworking and super friendly. What more can you ask for?  He is verbally abusive and passive aggressive. So even if the food is good, customers around me (including myself) are pretty turned off and uncomfortable because we hear all the demeaning words he says towards his employees (since he isn't exactly subtle about it). I would probably have given this place a 5 star review... But I really don't like the abusive attitude of the boss, especially treating defenceless employees poorly.   Seriously guy, be nice to people."}
{"text":"Tried their Bo kho and loved it! Also ordered their pho - the soup was a little too minty for me. The place has a nice atmosphere - playing the latest music, wooden tables, and colorful walls."}
{"text":"Came here to eat and grab takeout for someone else.  The chicken and egg rice was pretty standard and the shrimp and pork salad rolls were pretty tasty (if a little poorly wrapped, one of them was coming apart). The best part about the rare beef pho here is the beef.  It's thinly sliced and tender, the highlight of the meal.  Unfortunately I found the broth to be too greasy and while the food overall wasn't bad it was completely unremarkable.  They have a pretty good selection in the menu though and I'd be open to coming back and trying one of their other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's fairly new, and yet already fairly busy. Their food is always so fresh. The decor looks great and The staff is nice.   Came here a few times now, my favourite is still pho Tai. Their broth is flavourful and quiet authentic and clean.   There is free wifi available. They do it split bills during busy times."}
{"text":"Quiet cute restaurant. Fresh food, made quick and so deliciously good. Staff are friendly and prices for the amount of food you get is great. So many delicious juices to order from. Been to many Vietnamese restaurants and this one is now one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Came with high expectations because of friends' recommendations but dissapointed to find out that food here was not authentic Vietnamese. The grilled pork with noodle (bun thit nuong) I had was mediocre and tasted unappetizingly strong due to too much 5 spice powder. My friend ordered Pho, the broth was good but nothing mind blowing. Won't be back anytime soon since its quite out of my daily routes.  To their credit, the place is quite nice and clean compared to your typically shaddy Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"As others mentioned, their soup base is pretty good. It is well flavoured with the right spices and the portion of pho and beef was good. Three out of four of us ordered pho and we got a small plate of bean sprouts which we had to share amongst the 3 of us....would of been nice to give a little more as other pho places do. As well the service could improve, the servers seemed to be rushing all over the place and lacked organization where they were communicating loudly to each other."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0  This new restaurant is situated right beside Fresh Burger. Seen a few good reviews so I decided to give it a shot.  I ordered a bowl of pho to get a sense of where they are at amongst other joints around uptown. I chose dry noodles as it tends to be more chewy than fresh. However it was still borderline soft. The soup base was a bit too salty and oily as well. You can see the layer of oil on top and had a higher viscosity than usual as you scoop the soup. Toppings were just average and nothing to speak highly of.  We also ordered the special Bun Bo Hue which had a better soup base than the pho but the noodles came out really undercooked. We had to send it back and have them make another one.   The owners were nice but looked somewhat novice in terms of running a restaurant. They have quite a few things to iron out given that they just recently opened.   Will I return? Probably not."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  First off, Nam has a pretty awesome atmosphere for a Viet restaurant, at least compared to many I have been to. The decor reminded me of the classic open air food stalls in Asia (i.e dai pai dongs in Hong Kong). Of course, this was a much cleaner indoor version! The catchy and not too loud music was also a nice bonus.   As for the food, we shared the following dishes:  - Noodle soup with rare beef, brisket tripe, tendon and beef balls (Large $9.9): This was definitely a disappointment for me, the salt in the broth just overpowered everything else. At least it was clear and not oily though. I did enjoy the protein since the rare beef and tendons had a melt in your mouth texture, although for almost $10, I would've expected a bit more of it.  - Pad thai chicken ($11.90): This was my favourite dish of the night. The pad thai had a complex flavour profile, with the bean spouts, pickled veggies and peanuts adding a nice crunch. I usually can't take much heat in my food, but there was just the right amount in it.  - Special small viet rice with grilled pork chop and a sunny side up egg ($11.60):  I had mixed feelings about this dish. The pork chop was seasoned perfectly and I loved the flavour profile. However, parts of the meat was on the dry side. Although it does say special \"small\" viet rice on the menu, I do wish they gave a bit more rice! My dad loves his carbs, and the amount on the plate definitely wasn't enough. The good news is, there was generous amount of protein.  Overall, I think Nam has great potential and I will definitely return to try out other classic items on their menu."}
{"text":"Veggie noodle soup tasted like the veggies were still a little raw and hard. Busy during lunch hours and service was passable.  Good portion sizes but could be cheaper."}
{"text":"Tried this place for a late lunch on a Friday as I've been curious about it every time I visit Fresh Burger. Here's the thing, the food was really good. It was fresh, not greasy, and came out quickly with a good portion size. Food alone, I probably would've given it a 5! The reason for below was the cleanliness and the service. There were 4 ladies working on the service side, 3 of them teens and the only one working was who I assumed was the mom. The teens were loud, kinda obnoxious and were avoiding doing any actual work. I also never saw anyone wash their hands after handling money and then food.....There were maybe 3 tables with people at them, the rest empty but were all dirty. I watched people leave after their meals and the dirty tables just sat there. They were only cleaned when someone else would come in and ask for that specific table. Anyways, I'm all for a family business and supporting local, but this one needs a bit of help in the service and running the front of house. I'll may be back for the food, but only take out."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good but they changed their rare beef and flank and now it doesn't taste as good anymore. The flank became very tough and rare beef lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening around 6:30 and it was pretty empty, but by the time we left it was pretty full. The restaurant itself was really clean with an open concept and the service was really friendly. The guy working there was extremely helpful and enthusiastic, especially when he explained the daily specials, but a little forgetful. I ordered the dry chicken wings with lime sauce and the dry Phnom Penh noodles with half egg noodles and half glass. The Phnom Penh noodles were delicious! It comes with thin sliced pork belly, shrimp and tongue (I asked for no tongue) with a mix of red onion, green onions, garlic, cilantro and some sauces I can't quite describe. It was just the perfect combination. This dish also comes with a side of soup which was equally delicious. Our server forgot our order of wings, but it came out pretty quickly after I let them know. The wings were pretty good, but a little too greasy. I also went home feeling like I drank a glass of msg, so I would recommend drinking lots of water after your meal. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quite good!! 3.5 stars  The restaurant is cosy and the service is better than the normal kind that you get from typical vietnamese restaurant.  I had the chicken wings ($5), beef stew with baguette ($9), and grilled pork with spring roll ($9). Each of the dish are quite good and taste fresh and I enjoyed each of the dish. No compliant. I will definitely go again. Maybe next time I will try their  Pho and see if the soup is any different from other restaurant.  Oh, also tried the lime soda, quite good as well, this drink has strong lime flavour and complimented with some mint leafs which I like.   All in all, its better than the typical Vietnamese restaurant in terms of food quality and services and the good thing is the price is comparable as well. :)"}
{"text":"Great chicken wings, all beef soup was good but not excellent. Pricy than other Vietnamese and portion is small size for large.  The stay beef soup was excellent and meat was super tender! Recommend this one. Overall, good atmosphere, will come back and give it a try again but pricy!!!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Richmond Hill. Great little family Viet place. It can be busy on the weekends. I always get a their Pho Tai with Beef on the side..highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food arrived in a reasonable time.  There was free wifi in the restaurant.  The Curry Chicken with Baguette (banh mi ca ri ga) was the first to arrive.  It looked very authentic with the baguette arriving whole and not cut up into slices.  The curry was really good!  It was a nice consistency, not spicy at all, and full of mint and green onions.  It was a really solid curry sauce that went really well with the crispy baguette.  The pieces of chicken were decent too and there were chunks of potatoes.  On the side of the plate, there were some pickled vegetables like cucumbers, carrots, and cabbage.  When I ate the pickled vegetables together with the curried baguette and some chicken, it tasted so, so good!   The large bowl of beef pho (pho dac biet) soon arrived.  The large size was indeed large and I liked how the broth was steaming hot and almost boiling when it arrived at the table.  There were a lot of meat in it (rare beef, brisket, tripe, tendon, beef balls) and the pho noodles were the thin ones.  It tasted really good.  I especially liked how the rare beef arrived raw and actually red in colour.  When you dipped it into the steaming hot soup, it quickly cooked in the soup.  It was so tender and delicious.  I especially liked the beef tendon -- the pieces were large and so soft and melted in your mouth when you ate it.  The order of Nam's dry crispy chicken wings with lime sauce (canh ga chien) was a little disappointing.  There were only 7 chicken wings in the basket.  For a price of $7.90, my mom thought the price was not justified.  I was disappointed with the taste of the chicken wings.  I thought they could have been more flavourful.  Perhaps I should try the chicken wings with their special house sauce next time.  All in all, I was quite impressed with this new-ish Vietnamese restaurant.  I truly believe that their food was authentically made from Vietnamese recipes.  I would love to come back and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Just go. 2nd day open and they already have the dishes down. Definitely coming back to try their banh mi. What am I saying... The whole menu looks good. The friendly staff will help you with your order if you're not a regular.  Oh.  If you get here now you get a free appy with your entre. A little disorganized still but I like the effort they put through. Worth it."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since the pictures looked really good however was a bit disappointed. The interior is unique and very hipsterish, but seating is really tight and uncomfortable...I had to be careful not to knock anything over while eating.   I got the chicken bun and it was alright...the chicken was cut too small and there was way too much noodles. I could barely taste the chicken since it was cut so small. The spring rolls were okay but definitely had better."}
{"text":"ahhh so frustrating to write this review. Where do I start, service was awesome the first time we came here. Second and third time, not so much. Most of their dishes are actually really tasty. The rice dishes probably give you the best bang for your buck. In terms of viet flavor this place is legit. What makes this review frustrating is the portion sizes. As I said, the rice dishes are probably the most satisfying for what you pay. The pho broth tastes awesome (minimal MSG if none at all) but the whole bowl lacks a LOT of proteins in my opinion. If I order a L or XL pho I expect it to have lots of toppings. What I received was tons of noodles and not much else. The beef melted in your mouth however, so that was a plus. The curry and beef stew dishes... ughhhh so infuriatingly good, but suuuuch small portions and totally not worth the price. All in all, get a rice dish if you only wanna order one thing and get full.  Otherwise, be prepared to hit up Mc D's after your meal.  Final verdict? Amazing flavor, hit-or-miss service and frustratingly pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"There are nooo Bahn Mi places in Markham :(  Ever since It's a Bao Time closed, I have been searching long and hard.  This place comes close to what I am looking for, but not quite there.  (Food:) BAHN MI HEO is their pork belly sandwich and although a little heavy tasting, it's not a bahd sandwich (get it?)  I have definitely had better with bulgogi filling, but it definitely satisfied my craving.    The CHA GIO spring rolls were also a little heavy.  I think the problem is how they deep-fry the rolls, since I've been to other vietnamese places and the shell is definitely lighter.  I was also disappointed to know that there's no vegetarian option for the spring rolls (It would taste just as good, and save the environment!)     (Price:) BAHN MI HEO: $6.5  CHA GIO (3): $6.5  I find the prices to be really cheap! I couldn't even finish everything in one sitting!  (Ambience:) I like the ambience a lot!  I feel like my review is a lot higher because of the vibe I get from being there!  (Comparable:) The spring rolls at Pho Tai Bac are better (less oily and vegetarian.)  (Overall:) I know my review is quite harsh for 4 stars, but I still definitely enjoyed my meal here.  Aside from it being a bit heavy, the price was good, the ambience was good and the service was fine!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Viet food.  Tried almost everything on the menu, everything is great!  The owner is very respectful on customer satisfaction, and \"makes it right\" when something isn't up to par."}
{"text":"came here for dinner. the second i walked through the door, i could feel the authenticity of this place; it was amazing. we had to wait a little bit for seats, not long considering it's a saturday night. the food was really good and reasonably priced. i have to mention: they have extremely good service. in the restaurant, you write your own orders down on a sheet, and the table next to ours wrote chicken. when they served them chicken, they said that they actually wanted beef. even though they were the ones who made the mistake, the restaurant still recooked what they wanted for them, which i thought was really nice. on a separate note, while my table was eating our pho, we were being kind of slow. the lady offered us a bowl of hot soup, saying that ours looked like it was getting cold. shows how attentive the staff are. good food + good interior + good service. can't get much better than this."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant serving a good variety of authentic vietnamese dishes. The owner was really nice and welcoming. The pho and bun rieu were good, but #34 dry noodles were very very salty and I do not recommend it. We also tried the 5-spice banh mi and was disappointed at the lack of meat in the sandwich - too thinly sliced and couldn't really taste much of it. Price is on the higher side compared to other similar viet places in Markham."}
{"text":"We tried Fried wings, spring roll, banh mi, shrimp & pork dumpling. Ice tea, beef brisket side dish, pho, and beef stew.....Food was very good and tasty, place looked nice, and friendly....however they don't accept credit card"}
{"text":"Small family style Vietnamese restaurant.  Good service and the food is good.  Not salty and it's nice they brought a small pitcher of water for our table.  Searing is a bit tight but the size of the restaurant is not big so nothing you can do.   A bit hidden off of Leslie so just look for the Tim Hortons.  I had zero issue finding parking for dinner but I know this spot can get busy at lunch.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Had amazing meal and a rice paper wrap thingy (S2). The meal was so filling! Want to come back for their soft shell crab noodle."}
{"text":"I've been here twice;  Once I have the bun ga nuong cha gio (vermicelli with chicken and spring rolls) I know that this dish has peanuts however I do know that it is a garnish so you can ask for without it. However in my case even though I had asked for no peanuts I guess they forgot and still put peanuts. Usually I'd be pretty upset, but the owner and the chef were both sooo sooo apologetic that I knew it was an accident. We ended up getting another item on the house and an additional 15 or 30% I can't remember off our bill.   The second time I came here I had the banh mi and the employees remembered me and knew I had a nut allergy. I was very flattered and show how much they do care about their guest."}
{"text":"The people cooking your food speak Vietnamese ~ that's a big hint that you'll be eating something pretty authentic! I've dined in twice, done takeout once and plan to bring my husband here soon.  The Spicy Beef Stew had good heat, broth was robust, hit the spot. But my delight came at the end of my meal: the waitress noticed I didn't finish the meat in my bowl (not because it wasn't tasty but due to my personal limits on meat consumption) and she said, \"next time you don't like the food, let us know and we change it for you\". Wow, that coming from an Asian restaurant tucked in a nondescript plaza - sure caught my attention!  The next thing that caught my eye was a picture of their Phnom Penh Dry Noodles on their takeout menu. Looked so much like my favourite Bak Chor Mee (minced pork noodles) from Singapore! So I went back the very next day to try it. Though it wasn't what I was hoping for, this would serve as my go-to dish next time I miss home. [By the way, if any of you find Bak Chor Mee in the greater Toronto area, please connect with me!]  The following week I decided to do takeout Chicken Pad Thai. Oh-my-goodness ~ it was Heavenly! The noodle stir-fry had dramatic flavours: generous lemongrass, sweet and mildly spicy. Balanced with just the right amount of crunchy veggies (raw bean sprouts + surprising dollop of pickled radish) and peanuts, I ate with relish. I think I would have punctuated my meal with \"this is SO good\" & several grunts of satisfaction, but I was out in public and yes, I'm shy.  The Spice Seeker that I am, I was THRILLED to see on the table 2 types of chillies you can add to your food: a chilli paste (milder) and pickled chilli slices (one thin sliver packs a huge punch!)  Amazing food, great service, free WiFi. No wonder this place is busy during lunchtime. Fun decor with a rustic Asian feel, the noise adds to the ambience. Cash & Debit only. Come early so you can get a parking spot in the plaza :)"}
{"text":"food was really good, brisket banh mi was bomb.  tv was surprisingly nice, could watch the ball game while slurping my noodles. damn. grilled chicken vermicelli came with really good fish sauce. i love fish sauce. washroom was nice, someone didn't flush tho"}
{"text":"This place is small but man is their food fresh and delicious. Be prepared to wait a bit, because it's ALWAYS busy, but you won't regret it once you taste the food. The quality of the pho is probably the best I've had! Service is fast and friendly too."}
{"text":"Have tried a lot of Vietnamese  restaurants around town. This place the PHO broth is not as tasty  as I would have like it, have tasted better, the rice dish I had was delicious grill chicken and short ribs and I enjoy the broken rice and portion.  Can't say the same for the PHO the broth was plentiful but noodle and beef was skimpy as it was a large. That being said I will give it a another try. Debit and cash only."}
{"text":"Nam is a new restaurant opened right at Leslie and 16th in a plaza behind a gas station.  It's very hard to spot, so I recommend setting up your GPS if you want to try this place.  Visited this place with a friend on a weekday for dinner and it was alright.  This restaurant has a very cute decor, somewhat modern and trendy and I love the open concept kitchen.  Sort of makes you think you are eating at those wonton noodle soup place.   We ordered a pho each and a veggie spring roll (rice paper one) to share.  The pho is decent as the amount of noodle and meat is very generous and their soup base is good. The soup base is not too salty like your typical 88 or super light where it feels tasteless.  The Pho here I would definitely recommend!  The spring roll we got was good too, but I felt the spring roll (veggie) didn't really have any flavours so I did not enjoy it that much.  Overall not a bad choice if you want a quick pho near the 16th and Leslie area."}
{"text":"What a great find! This Vietnamese restaurant is a modern take on the traditional pho places around town.   I came on a Friday night and it was really busy. The special on wings ($5 on Fridays) might have something to do with it. Along with the wings, we ordered their Bun Bo Hue and Hu Tu nam Vang (#34). Both noodles were amazing, but the #34 dry noodles were my absolute favorite! They are unlike any noodles I've ever tasted before. The flavours were explosive and paired perfectly with a bowl of their fantastic soup.   The prices are higher than traditional pho places, but are definitely fair for the great food you get. Definitely a must try place!"}
{"text":"I heard about Nam from a friend who has come several times in the past. He highly recommended their special platters which includes a choice of meat and comes with rice paper, vegetables and toppings. Upon submitting our order which included the special (for two people) and their 5 spice pork belly sandwich we were notified that the special was unavailable. Our waitress asked us to modify our order as the specials could only be made by the owner. I was confused because the special consisted of other items on the menu but understood that perhaps there were certain things unavailable. Quite frustrated we decided to order two bowls of pho (note the same kind) and the banh mi. We were then told that the banh mi was also unavailable (although she did not tell us this earlier). Moments later we spotted that the special we wanted to order arrive at an adjacent table. We waved the manager over and asked her about the special. She then told us that some specials were available including the one we originally ordered. At this time one bowl of the pho had arrived and it was too late to change our order. It took another 10 minutes for the second bowl to arrive. One would expect the manager to take pride in their business and to show some goodwill but we were surprised that we didn't even receive an apology. Aside from the customer service, the pho itself was mediocre and the portions we received were considerably less than what we have had at competitors.  We were very disappointed at the overall experience and will not be revisiting in the future."}
{"text":"Coming here based on previous good reviews and fb reviews... I did have higher than regular expectations for this place...   Came on a Sunday afternoon after running all my errands. Arrived at closer to 3, realizing at the door that they close from 3-5pm. We were still able to order food.  I wasn't sure if it had anything to do with the time we arrived, the pho soup was watered down to quite an extent so I was kind of disappointed.   We ordered the Viet spring rolls, 1pho, and a  rice. Nothing really screamed to me and was super delicious... Everything was quite average,  in food,  ambience and service...   I may come back at an earlier time, giving it another chance for the pho broth...  It is a bit pricey for pho around Richmond Hill and Markham area compared to other restos.."}
{"text":"Very relaxed atmosphere, well designed, spacious.  Menu is small but tasty. Food is extremely tasty and portion sizes are outstanding. Try the smoothies, fresh and tasty! And the portion is huge."}
{"text":"Very athletic Vietnam food, yummy Pho, great Pad Thai, #34 is my favorite! I am so happy that I can have good Vietnam food near my work place now."}
{"text":"Cozy family place, steady flow of people and always busy at dinner time every time I've been (which is quite frequently). Not only is the food delicious, but they have super unique items on the menu that you don't see at most Vietnamese restaurants and a good deal on wings. Also their smoothies and Vietnamese drinks are so refreshing! My family comes here about once a week and we always look forward to it. The owners and staff are warm, welcoming and bend over backwards to accommodate your special requests. I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food seems pretty authentic. More variety than average Vietnamese restaurant. I tried their Phnom penh style noodle, comes with a soup on the side. Taste better when added some spicy sauce. We also ordered the beef noodle. Taste is okay, but soup too salty. Price is slightly more than average, but not too bad. Decor is causal industrial and cozy. Will go back again to try other food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rating for this Friday dinner. We arrived at about eight and didn't have to wait too long before we were seated. (It's close to 9pm their closing time anyway) They didn't really greet us so we just waited near the door. It's quite a small restaurant.  They let you write the order number on a piece of paper. And then the bean sprout for the pho arrived right away.   Maybe it's a bit understaffed at the kitchen cuz we waited long for our order. We saw that there were two waitresses and maybe eventually the owner also came out to help but there were three kitchen staff running around at the back.   We ordered spring rolls, chicken pad Thai and a rare beef pho.   We had a spring roll which is piping hot and the sauce that came with it was very nice.  Then I got my chicken pad Thai. And the reason that I got it relatively fast (still maybe 20 mins after we ordered) was because the table next to me who arrived earlier, also ordered a chicken pad Thai. Anyway the pad Thai was pretty good, very flavorful.   As for the pho, it arrived another 20 mins after the pad Thai so totally at least 40 mins wait.  You can imagine how sad the bean spout has been idling on the table for this long. And it was actually brought out by one of the kitchen staff. To me pho should be something that can be put on the table right away since the broth is already made, noodles already cooked, so I really don't understand why the holdup.  Luckily The pho was not bad, broth wasn't oily and full of herb.   In terms of the layout, there was really not much space between u and the next table. So the whole dinner we were (passively) listening to the table next to us.  I could tell that they try to have more stylish decor than average uptown Vietnamese restaurant.  As for the price/portion, about standard for average Vietnamese restaurants. BTW cash and debit only.   I think I will visit again ;)"}
{"text":"Get a reservation after 6pm on weekends, it gets busy. The decor was nice, interesting.   Overall, were happy with all the food we ordered. Deep fried pork spring rolls were the best, as well as the Vietnamese beef brisket curry with bread. The 2 pho bowls (rare beef and cooked beef brisket) were okay, well portioned, though the soup was a tad oily. We will skip the cold shrimp rolls next time; although it wasn't that bad, the shrimp tasted like freezer and it could be improved with more fresh herbs."}
{"text":"I can see why this place had 2-3 star reviews. I've been ordering from this place since they opened. I had a couple times where their food wasn't amazing but I came back in today and it was great!  Ordered a bahn mi and a beef curry and the food came quick. THEIR BAHN MI IS SO GOOD. Since i'm like everyone else and love bahn mi boys, this place is a great alternative when i'm too lazy to travel. Surprisingly, their curry was really delicious despite the fact that i'm not the biggest fan of the dish. They definitely changed some stuff around because they were a lot more organized this time. Glad to see this place is doing well.  Also their drinks are bomb af, the smoothies are huge so its well worth the price. They aren't exactly fruity but more creamy and sweet. However, i'd skip on the ice coffee."}
{"text":"Nam is a really cosy viet resto. By cosy I mean small. LOL. The staff constantly struggle to deal with the flow of people in and out. I felt bad for them. The food here is over priced compared to other viet restos. However, some of the items are more premium and are justified in price. Others are not however. The brisket pho is well worth the $13. But for some, that is a hard price to ask for when other pho joints charge $8 or less. I also enjoyed the crispy chicken wings but portion size was too small for the price. Would I come back? Only if I was in the mood for pho brisket and I didnt mean waiting in a cramped small space. Solid 3 stars ***"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we've been here and it's just as good as the first time we went! We had the rare beef pho which came out piping hot. Nice, thin, and chewy noodles with a good portion of delicious beef. We also got the grilled chicken vermicelli salad bowl. Chicken was flavourful and super juicy and good amount of vegetables and noodles. Also love the atmosphere of the restaurant. It's our new go to Vietnamese restaurant. So good!"}
{"text":"First off, their food is good. But service really needs a LOT of work.  I can usually let mediocre service slide, but not this time.   Their food has always been consistent, serving quite flavourful and tasty broths. Their chicken wings (both wet and dry ones) are also very delicious. I do not have any problems with their food, however, I do need to rant a little about their service. They were a solid 4 -4.5 star until the last dinning experience I had there. It was just poor customer service which made it really hard for us to want to revisit again.   We got there at 6:30PM on a weekday, and there was already a line. Good news was that there were several tables finishing up at that time. There was only a table of 2 and a table of 3 in front of us, so we thought it shouldn't be too long before getting seated.  We stood there and watched a few tables cleared up, and the two parties ahead of us were seated. However, no staff seemed to have acknowledged us in line. More and more tables cleared up, and yet we were still not seated. We saw a table by the front, so we asked and finally got seated. That took a good 30 minutes. Both of us already knew what we were going to order and were able to place our orders within a few minutes of us settling down. One of the staff took our order, repeated the order back to us, and put it in for us. We were quite excited for the food to come.   We thought the service was probably a little slower that day due to the high volumes of orders. Thirty more minutes in, yet we still haven't gotten our food. Mind you, the tables that got seated and ordered AFTER us were already served with food on the table. We asked the staff nicely as to whether the food is coming. The staff said it is on its way. We waited for a few more minutes, until the staff came back to us saying \"what did you order and who put your order in\".  At that point, I was quite annoyed. First, you don't seat us, second you forget our order and third none of the staff cared to stop by and asked if we ordered after 30 minutes. We obviously had to re-order and wait another 10 minutes for the food to get pumped out.   Fine, I was so hungry at that point that I was willing to wait another 10 minutes. Our food slowly arrived. But I really need to rant about the service for the rest of the night. We ordered two bowls of pho, a side of wet wings and shrimp rolls. I understand the table was small, but while we had food in one hand and utensils on the other, the staff decided to just stack our food on top of our plates. She did not care to help us move aside the plates on the table in order to fit the next dish. She literally just placed it on top my food and left. What kind of service is this?  We finished our meal at 8:30PM - TWO HOURS for pho. Unheard of. I was hoping that they would try to show a bit of regret for the poor service by either giving us a discount on our bill like ANY OTHER restaurants would have, or just apologizing. But neither happened.   I am sorry, but I do not think I will be visiting this restaurant any time soon. There are plenty of good vietnamese restaurants uptown, and honestly, busy is not an excuse for such poor service."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants in all of Markham. Their dishes are full of flavour and they have vietnamese dishes that other restaurants don't have. My family likes the beef in vinegar hot pot... Doesn't sound appetizing I know but it's sooo good when all the flavours come together and you make the wrap with the toppings that are provided. If you like spicy, the bun bo hue is delicious also."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  I'm a little embarrassed to say that even though this place has been around for over a year, it was only this visit back to the GTA where I finally decided to dine here. It didn't look too appealing at first, but the recent positive reviews and my dad's recommendation finally influenced me to try it earlier this month.  Nam is a relatively small place, therefore don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table. There's not really a good waiting area unfortunately, so try and squish in a bit...haha.  I had the rice noodle beef stew soup. My standards were quite high, as some of the photos looked really good, and the servers were highly raving that selection as well. It took a while to come out, but I definitely agreed that it was good. A bit pricier compared to the average beef stew noodle soup price, but the quality mostly made up for it. Portions were quite large too.  The lemonade I had to quench my thirst wasn't anything memorable. I'll probably stick with regular tea next time.  Service was excellent. Even though my friend and I arrived at a busy hour, they were willing to split our bills, despite a sign saying they wouldn't do it in peak hours. We definitely appreciated it.  It's a slightly pricier Pho/Vietnamese place, but the quality makes up for it. I definitely recommend it for Vietnamese food lovers."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place multiple times, but I've only decided to try it now. I should've came here a lot sooner. The food was amazing. I ordered the house special pho w/ house satay sauce (extra $1.50). The sauce came on the side so you had to mix it into the broth yourself - this allowed you to mix however much you wanted.   The pho was delicious; the broth was comparable to one of my other favourite pho restaurants. I'd definitely recommend coming here. The place was a tad small, but I only came with one other person, so we got a seat immediately as there happened to be a two person table available. The decor was alright, and the music wasn't too loud. Overall:  4/5 experience and would come again."}
{"text":"Really a 2.5 star - Mediocre Vietnamese food with service that needs a revamp. I've been here twice now, and I tried a bit of everything off their menu. With regards to Don N.'s comment, I have included an explanation at the end of my review.   First, their smoothies are a disappointment especially at a price of $5.95! Trust me, I've tried three different ones (coconut, green, tropical). They look gorgeous and pretty in that tall glass but that's about it. There's only a faint taste of the fruit/flavour... sometimes it feels like I'm drinking ice water. Of the three flavours I've tried, the green smoothie was the best - I could actually taste the avocado.   Their beef pho was decent (nothing out of the ordinary), and I found the broth a bit salty for my taste. Again, their spring rolls were good and crispy but nothing special.   Off to some of the good things to try!  - I like their shrimp chips which came with a satay style dip (yummy!). It was a good amount to share as an appetizer.  - I also enjoyed their special nam style wings which came with a lemon black pepper dip. The wings were crispy and tossed with some bell pepper/onion.  - Their rice dishes are plentiful, which might explain the higher price for it. I've tried the chicken one, and it came with two large pieces of chicken, rice, sunny side up egg and vegetables.   As mentioned before, their service (slow and poor) needs a change. Food came out slow, with the exception of pho arriving within 5 minutes. Don't expect to eat at the same time. My friends were 3/4 finished before my rice dish came... We didn't get to enjoy our smoothies with the meal since the order didn't go through. I reminded the server of our smoothies and even then, it came after 10 mins and we were practically finished with our food.   All in all, would I come back? Probably not, unless I'm craving those shrimp chips.  ---- Message with regards to Don N.'s Comment to this review ---- I edited my review in order to include my message back to Don. This is because I do not want readers to misunderstand my 'two contradicting' review on Nam on Instagram and on Yelp.   With regards to my Instagram and my Yelp review of Nam, I never provided any 'opinion' on my Instagram (on both occasions) other than 'feasting it up.' Yelp would be my first time providing a review  of the food I tasted unless you count 'feasting it up' as a positive feedback. So, I'm sorry if there is a misunderstanding with this aspect.  Furthermore, yes, half my review covers the food that I received for free through your Instagram contest. However, I also had another full meal prior to that (drink, pho and apps) that I paid for. This was also reviewed - so my review regarding Nam would still stand for the smoothie, the pho, the apps and the service. As a practice of mine, I try places twice before I write and post reviews because I understand that hiccups (as mentioned by you) occur.  ---- Message with regards to Don N.'s Comment to this review ----"}
{"text":"Got off the highway..... Starving.  Been here once or twice and it was pleasant enough...today?  Not so much.  Walked into chaos..was seated at a dirty table full of dirty dishes and half eaten food.  Waited 10 minutes and no one came for my order....as I watched 2 or 3 servers walk by.. Several times with empty hands....no one bussed this table.  As a server I may be extra picky in this regard however I don't believe it's an exceptional expectation to have tables bussed promptly.....they are slowing their table turnover by leaving the tables dirty.  Or maybe people like being seated with the previous occupants lunch remains? Not sure.  I couldn't stick around to find out.....lots of pho places in the area that don't present an air of chaos and dishevelment."}
{"text":"This my 1st choice for viet food in markham richmond area.  Pho is right not salty and tasty broth. Meat qty is right. Rice dish are good size with 2 big piece of meat. Ie. Pork chop. Viet bun sandwich is delish. My boys love the food here. Im usually here at least once a week. It always satisfy my pho craving. Viet food by real viet owner cook. Staff and service is friendly."}
{"text":"This place is actually quite good, I got the pork cutlet with egg and rice and it was really flavorful. A few friends got pho on our table as well. They  were raving about the pho. Richmond Hill definitely deserves a good pho place and I think this is pretty good for what it is. Check in on social media to get a free thai iced tea!"}
{"text":"Great experience. We arrived at 8 and there was a short wait for a 2 person table.   Ordered two pho, pork spring rolls, lemonade, and curry beef with a baguette.   Everything was fresh and tasted so good!   The pho was great, although I would've preferred more noodles. The beef quality was good, the soup was very flavourful but a little salty. The pho came with regular onions, basil, little bit of coriander, green onions and beansprouts on the side.   The spring rolls were great, they have a rough texture outside and were deep fried to perfection. By far the favourite thing I ordered.   The curry beef was good, had better. It's coconut based, flavours are pretty good.   The lemonade was amazing, not too sweet, nice, cold and refreshing. It came with basil as well and didn't over power the lemonade.   The food came rather quickly. Pho came out before the appetizers but we're ok with that.   I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"The only thing I liked about the meal were the spring rolls.... I definitely did not enjoy my chicken Pad Thai- it came out ten minutes after everyone and it was all dark meat with no sauce. My friend like his meal. Maybe it was an off night for them but I don't think I'd return. A side note you can't split bills during busy time."}
{"text":"Went in with a bunch of friends at 7:45 pm with 7 people and we only booked 15 mins prior. Despite having to wait for another 15 mins because the previous table have yet to leave, and the amount of food we can order was limited due to it being a small store on sunday night, we had a fabulous experience. I personally ordered number 32, a traditional dish from northern vietnam, and had an orgasmic experience in my mouth. Complimentary tea was also pretty great and the waitress recommended me other great vietnamese dishes that I should try next time.  Overall the food is great, and despite the busy traffic, it is definitely worth a try here. Make sure to order number 32."}
{"text":"Come for the food, not service. I've been here multiple times for lunch on weekdays and although they are always under staffed and the kitchen is chaotic, their food has not disappoint.   Their pad thai is the best I've had! It's looks like a simple dish but it's hard to master and perfect. Their noodles is chewy but not to a point of rubbery texture. All ingredients and noodle are evenly tossed in the sauce. The sauce is adjusted to taste more sweet than sour and salty. Their pad thai is quite impressive but I personally do find this dish \"boring\" after 20 more bites. I usually order the chicken vermicelli, which comes with 3-4 pieces of pork spring roll (they no longer offer chicken roll). Unlike some places that skimp out on chicken, this place has been giving a generous portion and I love that the chicken is grilled till the outer layer is crispy. On Fridays, my group likes to share the 7 pieces chicken special for $5. The curry with roti is also tasty and great for sharing!   Service needs improvement but if we're talking about food only, this place is where to try authentic Vietnamese food for a good affordable price."}
{"text":"Foods always good here. Different from the usual Vietnamese restaurant like pho 88 and such. I think there's way more authenticity on this party. I have never ordered pho gear because nam was able to show me the other dishes in Vietnamese food. I just think that service could improve a little bit, and maybe hire a few more servers because it often gets busy and just all over. Food doesn't come at the same time though. When it's ready it's ready so don't wait for each other lol.!"}
{"text":"Décor is not bad, trendy... (even though it could be less cluttered/messy). I got my Pho with rare beef soon after I've ordered it and was disappointed. Broth is very diluted, watery... Beef texture was strange, so was the noodles' texture. Some very slight chemical aftertaste for the whole dish, not sure what is that - low quality water used for cooking? I had to specifically ask for a glass of water to get one and the sign by the cash register says \"Take out containers are 35c each\". Um-m-m, really? :-|"}
{"text":"Really like the bun rieu cau! It comes with whole soft shell crab that really hits the spot. Would recommend making a reservation as the line up can get long on the weekends."}
{"text":"If you're looking for traditional Vietnamese food in the Richmond Hill area, this is definitely the place!  As soon as you walk in, the place has a very modern cafe style with a great vibe and friendly staff.   They might appear a bit disorganized and considering how busy they were, I was still pretty happy with their service.  Since it is our first visit tonight, we ordered more dishes to share between my husband and daughter.  Coming today on a Friday night, they had their weekend special \"Bun Rieu\" (tomato broth with crab vermicelli soup).  This is a must have if you come here on these days.  The flavouring was definitely on point.  Absolutely delicious.   We also got the grilled pork, spring roll on vermicelli which was good but it didn't quit stand out for me as places like Pho Metro or Little Saigon does it so well.  Next we had the Banh Mi Pork Belly (Viet Sub) which was also a great dish of the night!  We finished off with the beef stew with rice which had a lot of meat that was very tender but flavour was only okay.  We didn't get to try the Pho soup noodles so we'll be back for sure to try it out."}
{"text":"Saw mixed reviews on Yelp so I was hesitant to try Nam, but decided to venture in one snowy afternoon for lunch.   The restaurant is not hard to find (right next to Fresh Burger at Leslie/16th). Though it's a small space, the restaurant has soaring ceilings and rustic wooden tables. The restaurant also has a cool neon wall light and overall the ambience of the restaurant is great. I came in with a large group but was able to be seated immediately despite the fact that the restaurant was packed.   Immediately we were given tea, the customer service was fast and efficient. After looking over the menu, we wrote our choices down on the sheet of paper provided. I opted for the tofu pad Thai. The tofu was nice and crispy, and the noodles had amazing flavour. There was a perfect mix of crunch with the raw bean sprouts and peanuts along with the crispness of the tofu and saucy-ness of the noodles - it was great! The others got ginormous bowls of pho which looked very appetizing.   They easily split the bill for my group, however only cash or debit is allowed.   In all, Nam is a solid spot, but I wish that they had more vegetarian/fish options. Vegetarians like pho too!"}
{"text":"So this cute little Vietnamese restaurant just opened. I came by during their soft opening today, and I was impressed with their decor. Super cozy, not like any other viet restaurants I been to before. I was there for about an hour for lunch, and noticed how my clothes didn't even smell like food after I left considering the kitchen is open concept and you can see the chefs cooking.  I got the pork spring rolls (cha gio heo) & I was in love!! I ended up ordering another one before I left. I found it pretty convenient that their soft opening menu had different meat options for the spring rolls in pork or chicken. So thumbs up to that.   I got a dish of bun bo hue, and the flavour was on point. Huge portion too.   & I shared a bowl of pho with my sister. She got the pho tai. Because I'm not a big fan of pho myself, especially dry noodles because they ran out of fresh I would give this for my own preference a 4/5 but the soup wasn't bad at all   We both shared a plate of chicken wings and I believe it came with lemon pepper sauce. Like (lemon pepper rub) I highly recommend this dish. I'll be back for it!! I gotta come back to check out what they have on the rest of their menu since it was a soft opening menu.   To the owners keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place an updated review, not because I came here again (which to be honest I was planning to come back and give it another try), but after reading the owner's rude response below. I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE COMING BACK, and I will also encourage my friends and everyone I know NOT TO either.  I clearly stated in my review that I'm not Vietnamese and not familiar with Bun Rieu. I did not question whether it was authentic, I was only giving my person opinion on how I liked the dish, like a normal Yelper. I even said the soup was good. I may not know traditional Vietnamese food and culture but that doesn't mean I'm not open to trying it, which is why I paid a visit.  Didn't think writing an honest review would lead to being attacked by the owner publicly on social media. Super disappointed. Says a lot about your customer service one word, RUDE  As chef while I admire you defending your restaurant, but your negative response to me tells me you're not open to criticism or improvement, nor can handle a customer's honest opinion. To negatively comment about me for giving you an honest opinion (which is what yelp is all about) tells me how simple and closed mind you are as a chef. If I'm wrong I don't mind being properly correctly but doesn't mean you have to be rude about it. I'll take the negativity with a grain of salt and learn from it but so should you especially as a chef or else you won't last in the industry.  Thank you for your ruthless response. I'm sure that definitely gives you a great impression to others. I hope others won't have to experience it for just being honest.   ------------------------------ March 28, 2017 I've been hearing quite a lot of hype about this place so I wanted to give it a try, even though my brother warned me it was a hit or miss restaurant. Didn't believe it until I tried it, at least my last visit here for lunch on a Sunday was not great.  Spring roll & Pork Vermicelli ($9) This was just really bad, like one of the worst Vietnamese vermicelli dishes I've had. The pork meat was not only tough but really salty and the bowl only had a handful of pieces. Even dipping it in the fish sauce didn't help dilute how strong it was marinated. First time I've had Vietnamese spring rolls where the skin was orange color. To me that tells me they are reusing old oil to fry the spring rolls. The vermicelli noodles were thick, all stuck together and tasted raw. Even the veggies under the noodles were all raw bean sprouts, they couldn't even spare mixed chopped cucumbers, or radish like what most places do.  Bun Rieu with soft shell crab ($14) This was one of their known specials that they only serve on weekends. I'm not Vietnamese so I don't know how traditional this dish was but I thought it was odd that the bowl also came with a pork meat patty, and pig blood. To me, the fact that the soft shell crab was served inside the bowl defeated its purpose as the soft shell crab ended up being soggy. The soup was good, strong in tomato flavor."}
{"text":"- Their broth for pho is pretty damn good, generous portions of meat (quality thin cut meat) - Pork fried spring rolls are crispy, generous in portion and just delicious!  - The short ribs on rice with fried egg, was by far the best rice dish I've ever had at any Vietnamese restaurant. Again with the huge portion of quality ( little to no fat cut ribs) charred on a charcoal grill I'm guessing. Comes with a side of cucumbers, pickled carrots and daikon and lettuce. Also got a side of soup and the broth for this was also tasty!  - Don't go here expecting spectacular service! Also on weekends they have a Bun Rieu special, go early before they run out or GO EARLY to get a seat, there was a line up! - OH and also you have to ask for their in house special hot sauce, next level of spices and flavour to add to anything you order there!  - My go to viet spot in Richmond hill now!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I am amazed at how well decorated and clean they keep this place! Service was decent and the decorations made the whole experience more entertaining. The owners are Northern Vietnamese and their food were very flavourful. We ordered fried rolls, dry hu tieu, and broken rice. My bf and I could barely breathe after the meal and everything is decently priced. I will definitely come back to try their che ba mau and coffee!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  Their service is good.  Just the place is pretty small, so you would have to wait for seating.  There is limited parking space as well.  I would suggest for you to order takeouts if possible.  They have a good choice on the menu, I really liked their soup base and chicken wings."}
{"text":"Nam is an excellent Vietnamese restaurant at Leslie and 16th (South of 16th, on the west side of Leslie). They have traditional authentic Vietnamese dishes as well as other options with a flare of modern fusion.   Their banh mih's are delicious with the right amount of heat and baguettes stuffed with toppings.   I've had their rice plates (bun) with short ribs and it is delicious. The ribs have a nice charcoal singe to it that adds some crunch, while the flavours are distinct of the marinade. The rice has a bit of sauce on them as well, so that it isn't dry.   I also had their rice paper wraps that come with a lot of toppings to assemble yourself. You dip the wraps into the hot water then begin assembling with veggies and the selected meats.   Seating is limited so be sure to get there early for dinners, especially on weekends. The staff are helpful. However, in terms of Western etiquette I'd say they are sometimes unintentionally condescending because they seem to assume non-Vietnamese patrons don't know how to eat certain dishes. They are nice and as mentioned, very helpful in explaining. I don't find it to be an issue though I can see others misinterpreting their eagerness to help as being rude or curt."}
{"text":"Excellent food and Service! I eat at many vietnamese Restaurants and I'd give this a higher rating if I could. I had the bun which was very flavourful with fresh salad. My server was very attentive and the place had a good atmosphere.  Mind you this was my first visit so I'll confine my review to the bun for now."}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE. extremely RUDE.... They gave me the wrong order, it was their mistake and all I asked is to return  the right order to me (I asked politely). Then a man came over RUDELY AND LOUDLY SAID \"WHAT'S THE MATTER\"?.. I saw other customer sat near me are all looking over. He made me felt embarrassed and sound like I am complaning. .....and I have to explain it to him again. As a customer, I shoudn't be treated rudely. It was YOUR PROBLEM,Why don't you just go check your record and see what was wrong?   Also, he shouldn't interrupted me again while I am in the middle of eating and I noticed people looking at me again.  LEAVE ME ALONE.  I am not going back again."}
{"text":"Authentic good Vietnamese food! This small restaurant is always packed on weekends with many people waiting, so that's an indication of how popular it is. I tried the curry chicken with rice, crab and tomato noodles, and regular pho, which were all very good. Portions are also decent and service is not bad given how busy they are. The only thing I didn't like was the Thai iced tea which was too sweet. I would recommend making reservations if you don't want to wait at the door for a table."}
{"text":"Nam Vietnamese Restaurant has a lot of potential and will do well in this area without other authentic Vietnamese restaurants, if they would just improves on a few things.  I love the decor of the restaurant which is quite unique compares to other restaurants. The staff is friendly and willingly to help but still need training and more serving experience.  Menu is small but they do have a few items that are not available from other Vietnamese restaurants in the area and those were well prepared: Bun Cha Hanoi ($12), Hu Tieu Nam Vang Dry ($9.90). Their Bun Bo Hue ($9.80) has a nice lemongrass and ginger broth.  Things to avoid: Spring Rols ($6). Those were the worse I ever ate. The wrapping was hard and chewy and there was hardly any fillings!   Smoothies were quite tasty but the portion is small and presentation was not the most appealing.  Good luck to Nam and hopefully more improvement can be made so it would be my go to Vietnamese restaurant in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"A small gem that is in a small plaza jist by leslie and 16th. Menu is not overwhelmed like other pho places. Flavours are there for those that are looking for that viet taste. They alsovhave weekly specials so look it up on their site and ask when visiting."}
{"text":"The pork chop rice was really good.  Large pieces of pork chops. Not the flat thin slices of pork like most viet places offer in the area.  The fried egg made everything taste better!  We checked in an ask for one free spring roll.  They were nice enough to give us 3! They tasted good very light and crispy.  Will definitely come back and try the soup next time."}
{"text":"I ordered a spicy noodle, and my mom order a medium beef noodle.  First thing first, there were 2 red chillis included in the garnishment, which I appreciated.  Unfortunately, the broth of both bowls tasted like they were loaded with MSG.  These good and the bad offset each other.  The medium beef pho was small in portion.  The pho was fresh, bouncy on the bite, and tasted good.  Mom complained not having enough meat.  My spicy noodle, on the other hand, only comes in size large.  It was well portioned and had lots of ingredients.  The noodle was a different type of noodle from pho.  It was slippery to hold with chopsticks.  The broth was spicy enough to me.  Mind you my heat tolerance level is not very high.  You may add the chillies and/or chili sauce to make it spicier.  The interior decoration is nice.  The services is sufficient.  The parking is easy.  In summary, I like the noodle, but the broth is too MSG laden.  If a soup noodle does not allow you to choose a size, it is automatically size large.  Otherwise, you may consider ordering size large if you are a big eater."}
{"text":"Nam has some of the best Vietnamese food around. My go-to is usually the grilled porkchop combo and it is always delicious. They have a fish oil sauce as well that can pretty much go on anything so definately give it a try. Also they have specials for everyday of the week where there meals are a couple extra dollars off so definately more incentive time to go and eat there. You will not be disappointed.  Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"You could definitely tell that that wait staff was still getting in the groove. Not to take away from how friendly and helpful they were; the restaurant was just going through some growing pains.   I had the special noodle soup, which was pork and shrimp with a mix of rice and egg noodles. It was delicious. I'd definitely go again, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend.   Just a note to big groups, they don't split bills during peak hours."}
{"text":"Not too sure what the rave is about for this place but definitely had better food, cleaniness, and service. Decided to come here because it was something new for us. Got there just as it is starting to fill up but was able to get seated instantly. Placed the order for ice coffee, beef stew, and the pho. The ice coffee came instantly but two cups? We only ordered one so they had to take the second back, which initially it seemed like they didn't understand us speaking English? The portions of this coffee also seemed very small. Food wise, we had too wait for a while, long enough that we had to chase them for it, their reason was the was a group in front that made a big order...... you can see the kitchen (open kitchen concept), it just seem a little chaotic in there.   Finally the beef stew came first. It sure did not look anything in the picture, it was very watery which I am not used to for a stew.... soup maybe...but stew should be a little thick in sauce? Flavour wise it was ok but nothing too outstanding. Lastly the pho came which was surprising, I thought pho would be the quickest one to make especially with the rare beef. Once again there was nothing too outstanding for the flavour. But I do have to give it to them, the proportions are pretty big.   Overall the place just seems a little chaotic and disorganized (there was a table behind us that received their food and they brought out the same to them). Will probably go on a need to go basis.   btw, washroom felt a little slippery.... so watch your step!"}
{"text":"I come here whenever I crave pho. Sadly, every time I do, I remember why this place sucks.   Don't get me wrong, the food here is decent. Authentic pho, okay prices. But it's the service that is just plain awful. I came here for lunch the other day and upon entering was not even greeted with a \"hello, how many?\" until a good 5-10 mins had passed. The servers seemed preoccupied tending to their children, filling up hot sauce bottles, or just walking around with their heads in the clouds to notice that quite a few people were standing at the door.   After finally catching someone's attention, they sat us down only to forget to serve us tea and take our order. When the food finally came, they just threw it down.   Also, I find it incredibly bad form to have kids serve us and to be sitting at the same communal table with them while you're eating. Isn't there a room in the back for them to play in...or god forbid, they go home?   This place needs to up their service game pronto. Get some servers who know what the heck they're doing, have some proper manners, and some room for the kids to hang out in. Till then, you will not be getting my business."}
{"text":"I would give this new Vietnamese restaurant 3 out of 5. If you are looking for authentic Vietnamese Pho this is not the place to go to. Their food is a bit o the pricy side with less varieties.  We've ordered 2 pho with rare beef and beef balls, chicken wings, salad rolls (shrimp and pork) and salted lemonade and it comes out to $40. Salted lemonade was overly salty even they gave me syrup on the side, I can't even finished 1/3 of it. It feels like drinking saline :( salad roll is average nothing special.  chicken wings smells vey good but when you tasted it.. It's disappointing. Too much raw garlic and it's over powering the wings.  The best part is the raw beef from the pho which is fresh and soft."}
{"text":"First off, I have to mention the Thai Iced Tea ($3.99). They made it so well  that I wanted to order a second one for takeaway (but I'm trying to be healthy so I didn't!) Our order also consisted of Chicken Vermicelli, Grilled Pork Chop Rice, Curry Beef Brisket with Bread and Dry Wings. Everything came out separately. The Chicken Vermicelli was pretty standard/average tasting. At ~$9.50 on its own, I thought it was slightly pricier than other Vietnamese restaurants. The spring roll was crispy and had an interesting texture. The pork chop was good; wasn't tough/too chewy. The Dry Wings were really good - exploding with flavour. I'd definitely order this again.  I also loved the slices of pickled peppers on the table. They were the perfect amount of tangy/spicy but I might of overdone it because my throat was on fire after. Good thing I had the Thai Iced Tea!  They are quite busy during lunch hours. My co-worker made reservations just as we were leaving our office. I thought this was a little silly since we were so close, but I'm so glad she did because there were only three tables available when we got there and many people were coming in behind us. No complaints about the servers but you will have to speak loudly and clearly to them. The first girl did not understand me when I wanted to add onto our order. The decor is also very interesting... At first glance it looks \"authentic/street style\" but then you have a neon sign on the right making reference to Game of Thrones but at the far back it's very girly with pastel coloured paper lanterns/tassels. Very Pinterest-esque!"}
{"text":"Worst Vietnamese restaurant I have ever had the mispleasure of going to.   First thing, upon entering they sat our group of 5 at a table that was not meant to hold more than four and was very cramped. In addition we had to sit on uncomfortable stools, while the rest of the tables had proper chairs. Next the wait staff forgot about us, some how in the 600 or so square feet and 10-15 tables we were lost to the wait staff and didn't get any menus. Finally we get our menus after numerous attempts of flagging down someone.   The wait staff did not seem to be very well acquainted with the menu as we asked some questions and were responded with \"I'm sorry I'm not sure I haven't read the menu myself\" very unprofessional for a restaurant. In addition we asked if we would be charged for a substitution of beef tendon to tripe and were told no.   We all received our food and for the most part the house special pho was ordered and I ordered a phnom penh style dry noodle with soup on the side. It arrived and the noodles were just a big clump all stuck together. In addition the soup was extremely salty, this was also the case with everyone's pho. In addition we were told only afterward that there were no beef balls available and we received extra \"beef\" however from going to other pho restaraunt a it appeared that we received less beef then would be normally expected. We took issue with this because we were paying a decent amount for the soup, not expensive but more than other pho places we had gone to in the past so we expected a decent amount of toppings. When we got the bill we noticed that we were charged an additional $3 for the substitution, I found this unacceptable as they didn't even inform us of my having beef balls as it would have changed some of our orders and the fact that we asked about substitutions before hand. I understand they are a new restaurant and things happen but they did not seem the least bit apologetic.  We were very disappointed with both the food and the service we received. I am normally inclined to give a new restaurant a second chance if I can tell they are struggling and giving their best but that was not the case here. The food, service and atmosphere was not up to par for the area and price and we will not be returning. In fact we all went to the McDonald's down the street afterwards."}
{"text":"Awesome pho & great dining space! This place is always busy as the food is fresh, fast and delicious.  Great value as well!!  We went during lunch hour for a quick bite. We ordered the vegetarian rolls and LOVED them!! The one on the menu had pork and shrimp and we asked for a vegetarian one instead and they gladly substituted. I love the fact that for their Vietnamese rolls, the lettuce comes out of one end.  Also had the rare beef pho and it was so delicious!!  I ordered the large and it had generous portion of beef and noodle.  Broth was out of this world! The restaurant is clean and funky, with a mix of cool metal and wood chairs, and wood tables.  I believe it's a family run business.  Fast service and great food!!"}
