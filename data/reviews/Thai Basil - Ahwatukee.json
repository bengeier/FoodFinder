{"text":"Seafood lunch red curry plate.  Awesome. Tiny little place but clean and comfortable atmosphere.  As soon as I walked in I smelled good food!  They have free wifi and waitress was really nice!"}
{"text":"First time at Thai Basil and did not care for the food or the service.  Your money is better spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have had quite a few meals from here, I usually stay with the curries, chicken and seafood, they've always been okay.  Recently I tried the special duck curry for the first time as a to go order.  I was very disappointed; three very small shreds of duck meat and three times as much duck skin/fat.  Also had the crispy sweet potato appetizers, nothing crunchy about them, just a soggy mass."}
{"text":"No personality service, they tried to charge me an extra dollar when I asked for my Thai Iced Tea with no ice (usually places put way too much and my drink is gone in two sips). The fresh spring roll sauce almost make me throw up, I was literally wretching. The food was way over priced for what it was. I ordered three lunches and two of them were supposed to be Thai hot, they were mild at best, very disappointing. Service was dry and lacked friendliness, would not go back.

Oh and I bought an eggplant dish and there was barely any eggplant maybe two or three pieces!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times.  Actually, we usually get take-out.  If you're craving Thai food, this place will take care of the craving.  I really like their hot and sour soup, but everything that I've tried there has been good."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful and the server was very nice,
but ...
DON'T GET THE PAD THAI. Its NOT pad thai.

The young coconut... it was served whole with a spoon.
The coconut meat was to tough to scrape out with the spoon.
But the coconut water was refreshing.

I think I'll stick to Touch of Thai in north phoenix"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Ahwatukee!!! I get the Tom Yum soup extra spicy. It is the definition of delicious!"}
{"text":"Placed a take out order and when asked if I wanted meat I said no tofu only as I'm vegetarian.  When I arrived home with my order it was full of chicken :( I called to inform them I was bringing it back and they said ok.   When I arrived I received no apology for the inconvenience they just stared at me awkwardly.  A simple we're sorry would have made me feel a little better after having to drive 2 roundtrips.  Then I get home with second order and it's way to spicy. I asked for mild.   Dinner in the trash :( I won't be back to waste any more money here."}
{"text":"Was craving Thai food and happened upon this little place. It was about 11:45 am so it was not yet packed. We were greeted by a young woman who seemed a little grumpy or maybe just a little shy (who knows) The waitress was so nice and attentive. I ordered Red Curry (kang-dang) and it was SO tasty and fresh! I noticed a couple of people saying the food was bland, I didn't experience that at all. My waitress asked if I wanted hot, med, or mild. waitress kept beverage full and was always very cheerful."}
{"text":"I m writing this review as I m sitting in here. Ordered a noodles (\"Pad Thai\") plate straight off the menu just no eggs since I m vegetarian. Any restaurant in this entire world would understand that it comes with standard stuff mentioned on the menu e.g. Tofu, veggies etc. Guess what, after waiting for more than 30 mins, and my entire table (party of 9) had finished eating their half of the lunch, mine came in. And guess what it comes without a single piece of tofu!!!??? I mean you hv to be coming from different planet to be running a thai place n screw up someone's plate after delaying by 30 mins???? Common guys. To make it worse, in a busy lunch hour, they only hv staff of 2 people!!?? Told the guy (1 of 2) about tofu, he said he would \"check\". Another 15 mins had gone by everyone on my table finished their lunch waiting on me. The guy is trying to avoid looking at us. Finally told the 2nd person, she brought 3 tofu pieces literally slapped on top n handed over to me and time to leave. Taste is something a rookie in cooking makes it at home.

Since we go out for corporate lunches, I know for the fact this place will NEVER EVER get our business. And on the top they're gonna get so much -ve publicity from my team who witnessed this first hand and made fun of me all day!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I am a fan of thai food; however, my boyfriend is not. Therefore, when I get the night to myself I make sure to call in my order and it is always ready fresh when I get there. I believe it is the owner that is always there to greet me; she is so sweet. All the staff is diligently working while making you feel welcomed at the same time. Thai basil is my Thai food escape. If you like thai food and your wanting an authentic taste and atmosphere go to Thai basil on 42nd street and Chandler blvd."}
{"text":"Well.....they screwed up the order not once, but twice...went to pick up, and it was wrong...then recooked it and it was still wrong.....offered to recook, but we are too far away to drive back....wouldn't give a refund....every excuse in the book as to how it wasn't their fault....Um, you cooked the wrong food?  How is this not your fault?  Spend $50 and it was nothing that we ordered.  Stealing from customers in not a good business plan.  Thankfully.....I can do a charge back on my card.  Won't be back.....the Thai Basil on Chandler and Rural is so much better and friendlier....you should go there."}
{"text":"Thai restaurant with cheap eats and quick service.  I had the Chicken Pad Thai and coconut ice cream and it was really good.  Friends all ordered different foods and each was a fan of their meal.  We were there at 2:30 on a Saturday and the place was practically deserted so we got the full attention of the owners/servers.

My only complaint is that they don't have high chairs for kids."}
{"text":"My colleague bit into his egg roll to spit out a bolt. No further review necessary (see photo)."}
{"text":"My step mother is Thai, and so when it comes to Thai food, the food has to be pretty amazing to impress me, but when I ate at this location of Thai Basil last weekend, my taste buds LOVED what I was eating!!!

 I was also with my family who is not very... hmm how do I put this? Open to new things.. All they wanted was the BBQ chicken and of course my daughter wanted the very kid friendly,'chicken noodle'. Now I got the Peanut curry which is one of my favorite dishes my step mother makes, and while of course nothing can top your mother's meals, this dish came very close! I rarely ever get to experience authentic Thai food at that quality and words could not explain how excited I was to discover this little piece of heaven only minutes from my house! 

Now the pressure was on the rest of my table, would this restaurant I had already fallen in love with be a favorite of my family too? I was nervous at first for their rating because they tend to be very picky, (especially my teenage daughter!!) but she ate every bite on her plate and asked if we could come back again the next week! Success! 

My husband enjoyed his meal too and has promised that he will try something a little more adventurous next time as well. Overall this ranks as one of the best Thai restaurants I've found in the Phoenix area! Finally my family can stop searching for a place we all enjoy! And hopefully I can get them to keep trying new foods! I definitely recommend Thai Basil for all your  Thai needs!"}
{"text":"This wasn't bad Thai food, but it was a little undercooked. My eggplant was still really hard (almost raw). Their Ahwatukee location does it perfectly! It's worth driving a little further if you have time to go to Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Decent food. Not really authentic Thai food. You can pick your level of spiciness, which is good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I am extremely picky when it comes to pan-Asian cuisine, especially Thai food, and am constantly on the lookout for restaurants that serve food that is well-made, authentic, and delicious. Thai Basil delivers. While this individual restaurant is relatively small and dimly lit, this is just a minor inconvenience that is easily made up for by the delicious food. My personal favorite is the Pad Thai, noodles and meat served in a spicy peanut sauce. I highly recommend this place to my friends and coworkers and, after you eat here, you will too."}
{"text":"Overcharged for lunch. Ordered a green curry Thai chicken and a side of fried rice which was a tiny small box and paid $15 for everything. Did not even get a soup or salad, no side or drinks."}
{"text":"I don't understand the people who have caused the rating of this place to be so low.  I am not a Thai person, but I know delicious food when I put it in my mouth, and this place is great.

First the atmosphere: This is a fairly small place with a warm, pleasant feeling.  It's usually not crowded, so it's not a bad place to go to have a little dinner conversation, and maybe get a little bit romantic.  Maybe move in close with your lover and get some kisses in before you order those spicy dishes.

The food is great.  Fantastic flavor, good spice (I order 'medium' which is just enough to make me keep reaching for my drink), and reasonable sized portions.  A hungry person can go away fed but not bloated, and someone with a little appetite can have a little to take home!

I pretty consistently order the Beef Drunken Noodles (without onion, because I am a lover and have to keep that fresh breath) which have incredible flavor, and are a dish which I haven't been able to find at a lot of other Thai restaurants.  I definitely recommend it, and if you don't like it then you probably don't know what good food tastes like!"}
{"text":"We only ever order take out, but I really enjoy this little place. It's got a very neighborhood restaurant, family owned feel - which I love."}
{"text":"Over the last year we've had some good meals here. We went last week and it was inedible. The pad Thai was cool and had NO flavor while the curry was flavorless. When we pulled up, 2 of the kitchen help were standing outside smoking...not sure if they were the cooks for our food or not. Regardless, we won't be going back. It was a waste of money."}
{"text":"I will start by sharing that I have many years in the service industry and it takes A LOT for me to complain to a manager... or write a review... My family and I  have been dining here for years. Typically the food is good and the service hit or miss, however there are few if any other Thai restaurants in Ahwatukee so it's been our go to place. Well, no longer.  Today my son and I went to have a late lunch, we asked to sit on the patio and were sat at the table requested. We ordered a side of rice, spring rolls, and vegetable and tofu Pad Thai. The service was timely and the young gentleman that served us was friendly. When the food arrived I immediately noticed (as did my son) that the pad thai had a very metallic smell, upon further investigation there was a black smudge of something on the rim of the plate, which wiped right off ( no idea what it was) however I decided to take a bite.. it tasted awful and not at all like the pad thai I have ordered there before, many many times . It was oily, smelled bad and didn't taste like it would be wise to eat anymore. So, I asked the waiter to please take it off the bill and that the rest of the food was good but that this pad Thai was not at all what I was use to here and that  I just needed the check without it and no to go box necessary. His response was ( now this was a different young man than the original that served us ) that he \"needed to check with his boss\" I said well okay but I am not paying for that.  Next an older woman comes out to the patio and says- \"Whats wrong\" I explained that I had been eating there for years and that this was not at all what I was expecting and that we had to leave due to time and to please take it off the check.  She didn't say anything just walked away and went inside..... Next the younger man came back outside and laid the bill in front of me, I looked down and saw the $25 total. I said \"She is really going to charge me for an entire plate I kindly told her I strongly disliked both the flavor and smell of, and this after I have been a regular patron for over 10 years!!??\" He responded \"It is our policy if you don't like something you can pick something else not get your money back.\"   I said shocked, that \"I have been in the restaurant industry for over 12 years and never would force a customer to pay for something they only had a bite of and whole heatedly seemed so displeased with. And that my business, as well as my families is far more valuable than the restaurants cost of that plate of food. I said I will tip you 20 % because this was not your bad decision but for a manager/owner to ask me to pay for something that I know did not come out normally, and  I didn't even eat more than a bite of, is in such poor taste and bad business. I said, \"You may let her know that the cost of her not wanting to comp this meal has cost her much more than noodles, let her know we will never be back , and I will let others know how little valued I felt today.\"   Even my son said, who is 5 years old,  \"This manager should know some things are more important than money.\"   Well said son, we won't return."}
{"text":"I've always had a very good experience at this time basil location. The service is very fast and friendly, the food is delicious, and the selection is very good. I do wish they had lunch specials on the weekends."}
{"text":"Got sick from here...My food came out in about 30 seconds.  I should have known."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and I've waited to write a review about it all. I gave them a few chances and visits as I try to not to judge a small restaurant by its first impression. But, here it goes..

Wow, There Food (WTF) could use some work. I like stir fries and curry, so I usually order their Thai Basil Signature Dish or Green Curry. Many times, I'll get portions too small, or with the curry way too much curry sauce and not enough of the goods. And, that's usually with lunch takeouts - dinner takeouts are about the same deal. Yet, they jack up the prices, but I'll look like the same size as a lunch takeout!

I've dined in a couple times too, and It looks like if you want the true the dinner size, you gotta dine in - takeouts are a ripoff. 

Drinks are great. Water is good for the most part and I've ordered their Thai Tea sometimes. I don't know what's up, but it seems like these Thai Teas of the \"Basil's\" are just really sweet in general. Why do they even call it a tea? 

I guess I've knocked down two stars for their food, now a star for their service. Overall, pretty quick. I usually don't have to wait longer than 10 minutes for my lunch takeouts (as their lunch isn't really that busy whenever I go). When I dine-in, their waitresses are quick on bringing out water and taking our order. But, sometimes the \"language barrier\" makes it a little hard to get what I want. It's not a big deal - they still bring out what I want but it would be nice if they could understand what I'm trying to say. And, also courtesy is something they could work on. There waitress are little abrupt, and they seemed rushed most of the time, and I hardly see them smile or say a \"You're welcome.\"

But, aside from the complaints, this place is great for Thai food. Their spices are just right and the meats are always cooked well, and even the most underrated things like their rice is something to enjoy. I still bring my friends here and I occasionally order from them. They just need to work on a few things. 

Just to note, I think each Thai Basil is owned separately, so I guess there's one for everyone to try out. Like there's another Thai Basil down the street near Intel that has a slightly different menu. They're always packed whenever I pickup a lunch takeout too. I've never had a chance to dine-in, but I gotta wait a little bit longer for my takeouts there."}
{"text":"Worse thai food i had in a while. Tasted very watery. No flavor at all had a curry. Was pretty much coconut water with very little veggies and almost no taste."}
{"text":"Had a few dishes here and have never been disappointed. The service is always good and the food is well prepared with quality ingredients.  This point really stands out after having Tai food at a few other restaurant where ingredients are past their point. The food here always seems really fresh and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this Thai Bazil. 
We ordered the Chicken noodles dinner dish for take out.
I  ordered medium heat. 
The food was packed with tin foil in a Styrofoam carton. The food came to me very quickly. The restaurant was not busy so I didn't think much about it. 5:30 PM.
We live a short distance so it was maybe 5 min before opening the container. 
The food was bland and cold. No spice heat at all.
I  take partial blame since I ordered MED heat, so we will know better next time. The cold food was not acceptable though."}
{"text":"First time at Thai Basil in Ahwatukee.  My daughters birthday and she wanted Thai food so we always like to keep our business local.  Reserved a table for six adults and were seated.  Ordered 3 appetizers and 4 drinks from the menu, 2 Pina Colada's and 2 Moscow Mules.  Only 2 appetizers showed up and when the drinks came they were just coffee mugs with ice and vodka.  They did have little umbrellas with olives on them.  I asked if theses were the Moscow Mules and Pina Colada's we ordered and was told they were.  Four of the meals came out together and the last two came out after we were 1/3 of the way through the meal.  When the bill came we were grossly overcharged and had to argue the price.  We were charged for an appetizer that never came and charged much more then the posted meal prices.  We had to bring up the menu and go over each line with the woman running the place and she was not very nice.  We finally got the bill reduced over $50 to the correct amount.  Buy the way most of the food we did get was good, most not all."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Panang was really delicious. Quick and great service. I would def recommend to Thai food lovers."}
{"text":"Extremely polite, attentive staff with incredible Shrimp Pad Thai! BONUS for not having any hair in their food the way Panda EXPRESS just down the street is FAMOUS for!! Eat well, avoid cheap knock offs like Panda. We deserve better! Thai Basil ROCK!"}
{"text":"3.9 Rating
Picked up the Green Curry Chicken. It was delicious with a creamy coconut milk taste giving me the thai basil taste that I was seeking. This was a comforting dish that just tastes happy and comforting. 

Some complaints:
The large chunks of eggplant in the curry are kind of a pain. I could do without them.  Also, It would be nice to have the rice mixed in with the curry, instead of in a different box, but that's pretty trivial.

I am very excited to try the other curries, along with the rest of the menu. The green curry was great, I just want to try it all!"}
{"text":"Used to live & work right by this place, so I would come regularly. Sometimes the food was a bit garlic-y, but other than that, I was never disappointed by the food here. The service was fast & friendly. The portions were just right, and it seems like their food is made healthier than other Thai places I've been to. I LOVE hot spicy food, and they actually challenged my palette a time or two. So let it be know, if you ask for something very spicy, they will give it to you!"}
{"text":"I loved the Thai iced coffee. I order it with coconut milk. I love the peanut Thai bowl and spring rolls. The Thai coconut soup was delicious as well. Great service!"}
{"text":"Great food! Love the Yellow Curry! Hubby had the Green Curry. It was tasty. We called in our order and it was hard to understand the person we were speaking with and worried our order wouldn't be correct. I had asked for extra veggies in my curry.  Our order was perfect! The gentleman that was there was very nice and had no issues. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I just have a consistently great experience at this location for lunch, dinner and take-out. The ladies who work the lunch shift are great and always cheerful.  Some of the nicest staff at any restaurant I have had the pleasure to dine in.  The only time I had shaky service were a couple days they had off in the summer.  The replacements were very nice just not up to the usual standard, but I go so often I'm not one to ding new people as they tried.

I still recommend going with medium (5)  if you like pretty spicy without burning you up.    My parents always get no spice (0) as they are sensitive to spicy food.  So don't be afraid to take your friends who don't really dig spicy foods.

There is another location down the avenue near the Intel Plant which is also pretty good, but they are always super busy for lunch ( Go Figure ). 

Try:
- Pad-See-Ew  (Best in AZ )
- Pad Thai ( Seems Real to Me )
- Crispy Sweet Potato
- Purple Sticky Rice"}
{"text":"I have tried Thai food in many US and Canadian cities (Vancouver, San Francisco, Seattle) and I keep thinking that I will like it better somewhere besides Ahwatukee. And yet, I keep coming back here and loving it best."}
{"text":"They have a great green curry and huge spring rolls. Their beef and broccoli is just okay. I know, beef and broccoli? Well, it can be great. I've had beef and broccoli that's worth talking about. Anyway, the food was great and the portions were huge. I just moved to the area and I'm happy to find a thai place ALMOST as good as my favorite haunts in Chicago. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great location.  I used to come here at least once a week for lunch when I worked near 48th St. & Chandler Blvd.  Easy to understand menu and big patio for people who like to enjoy the Arizona sunshine.  Definitely a must if you have never try Thai food before.  They have 3 other locations to try out if you don't live near here."}
{"text":"LOVE Thai Basil.  My favorite is the Green chicken Curry.  My boyfriend loves the bean thread noodle soup.  It is pretty pricey but oh so delicious."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch. The place was busy (which is a good sign). The server offered us drinks right away. Though they were busy, we didn't wait that long for our food to be served. I ordered Pad Thai mild but it was still a bit spicy for my taste. I told the server about this and she took my food back, no questions asked. She came back with freshly cooked Pad thai which was perfect! 

The portions were huge for such a reasonable price. I give this place 5 stars for not only superb food but excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Wow, I was shocked to see some of the mediocre and poor reviews for this location. We went there for the first time today and had good service and food. I had the Pad Thai which I really enjoyed. Susan had some kind of peanut sauce rice thingy that she gobbled down with no problem. Flavor? Plenty enough for me and I ordered \"medium.\" The little bowl of soup offered as an appetizer was a nice touch too. We both really enjoyed our lunch experience but maybe we are not the Thai food aficionados some of the other yelpers are."}
{"text":"We have been to the location in Tempe and really liked it but the food here was just okay.

We had the pineapple fried rice, peanut curry and their Thai Basil special.  None of the food was spicy as we requested \"Thai spicy\" so that was a disappointment.  The peanut curry tasted quite different from the same dish we had at the Tempe location.

The service was very friendly and the food was brought out quickly. I wish they would have refilled our waters more frequently."}
{"text":"This curry is the best I've ever had. However, don't let the 5 stars fool you about the service. While they were attentive, the little old lady has a bad attitude. We weren't ready to order because we were chatting, I haven't seen my friend in like 6 or so years. When the little lady asked if we were ready and we said another minute please she rolled her eyes and scuffed while walking away. I kind of laughed it off and my friend said \"yeah I forgot to tell you, the food is amazing but the service sucks\". The little lady did the every time she came by, eye rolls galore and an angry look on her face. 
Dude, the food though, is seriously amazing. That's why I'm giving it 5 stars. Would you rather have amazing service but shitty food or the best curry ever and have a few eye rolls? I'll totally be back, she can roll her eyes at me all day long as long as I get me some yummy curry."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times the service continues to get worse. They are severely understaffed and it's impacting everything from their service to their food. We waited an additional 40 minutes for carryout when we were told the food would be ready in 20 minutes. They shorted us on rice as well. We ordered multiple dishes and they gave us one box of rice instead of a box with each dish like they are supposed to provide. The quality of the food is slipping. The curries continue to become more watery. The sauteed dishes or so dilute with water that you can't taste any seasoning but rather just limp vegetables that resemble a bad broth. It is sad because this place used to be 5 stars but it seems to me that they really don't care about customer service. Today was so pathetic, they had one person(one of the owners) serving tables, taking phone orders and busing tables. And the restaurant was busy! Seriously, you can't afford to hire a couple of waiters? 

This place used to be 5 stars back when they had a normal waitstaff but for the past 3 years or so, it just seems like they don't care about customer service. Unfortunately, now it's impacting their food. 

I would only order carryout. Stick to the curries. If they tell you 20 minutes, double or triple that time when arriving to pick it up. And don't tip on carryout!!!"}
{"text":"Update:  while I did and still do love this place. I've noticed they charge dinner prices during lunch and they refuse to honor the \"free Thai tea\" yelp coupon you get after checking in three times. Food is good, but customer service is poor. They were very rude about the coupon..."}
{"text":"Thai Basil has awesome food. Some friends have said there was some better Thai in the area but we still love the food. Eaten in once and the dining area is small but we love doing pickup orders."}
{"text":"I love Thai Basil! I've only been to the one in Ahwatukee (they have one next to Tops Liquors in Tempe), and I think it's pretty darn good.

They have all the usual suspects like Pad Thai Noodles, and it's a great vegan option because of the choice of tofu (or chicken or beef) with almost any dish and the rice noodles.

it's pretty darn cheap, too. i got noodle dish big enough for two meals, and some of the best iced tea I've ever tasted (seriously, these Thai folk have a secret recipe and i want it!) for about $8. and, you can order the dish as hot as you want it. I'm a pretty big wuss with spicy and i got a \"one\" and it was nothing. i would say a \"two\" would be qualified as \"mild.\""}
{"text":"ok... I am a \"Thai Virgin\".    We got to Thai Basil and got the menu and we were a bit overwhelmed.   Once we settled down and actually started to read the menu items,  we ordered Pad See Ew with pork and Spicy Rice with Shrimp.    We ended with Fried Bananas with Ice Cream.  All I can say  is  -  YUM!    I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. The menu says free soft drink and tea refills. So we ordered Dr. Pepper, she brought it in a can so I asked about the refills she said we don't have free refills. Ok, but it states that they do on the menu. As I was handing the menu to my boyfriend, she grabbed it out of my hand... she was very rude, but the little old lady sitting at the table greeting everyone was nice and cute. I won't be back to this Thai Basil, but since the food was delicious I'll try another one next time."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food! Take out or dine in, they always get it just right. Pad See Ew w/chicken is my fav! And their Pad Thai is better than most I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This restaurant has true knowledgeable cooks in the back. They don't just make the typical 'pad Thai' for those that generically order. This place knows how to make authentic Thai food. So glad it's in my neighborhood. Lucky me."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not the best but very far from bad. Haven't been disappointed yet and we eat here about once a week. The Thai basil is really good as well as the steak salad."}
{"text":"I will definitely back for more peanut curry and mango sticky rice, best place for having dinner these days"}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup is delicious! The service is great! Our waitress brought us waters as soon as we sat down. There weren't many customers sitting down to eat but they were busy with takeout orders."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch spot. Wonderful service and friendly atmosphere.  We eat here weekly. Food is delicious and consistent"}
{"text":"I love this place. Very nice, upscale but casual atmosphere, friendly staff, quality food, reasonable prices. Been to several locations, always good. You could come on a date, to grab takeout, with the family, whatever.  I've had other Thai here in the valley and this place is an 8.5 in my opinion for strictly the food, the other attributes push it up a bit.  Hard to go wrong here.  Why 4 stars instead of 5, feeling like I need to reserve those for absolutely knock your socks off, out of this world places,...sometimes I can be too generous, but this place is really good, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide what to have for lunch so ordered both: Pad Thai w/chicken and Red Curry w/beef. Tons of food for lunch, left-overs will be good. Chicken in the Pad Thai didn't have much flavor-needed some seasoning or marination, but overall very delicious. The Red Curry w/beef was yummy, a bit sweeter than I like. Definitely will come back to try other items."}
{"text":"The Thai food here is incredible.  The curries are all some of the best I've had and the Tom Kha and other dishes are great. The only dish that I didn't care for too much was their Pad Thai. The service here depends on who is serving you. Some are very friendly but some are not at all. Overall a great place though."}
{"text":"I order take out from here every chance I get. Love all the curries, the pad Thai is also very good. It's a great way to eat healthy and enjoy doing It!"}
{"text":"I added a photo of food I peered and paid in Yelp full. They turned my boyfriend away of picking up the food then called him on his way home saying he can come back and get it. We were angry! This isn't the first time. They offered to deliver it and all food wasn't delivered they then told me I didn't buy yellow curry the lady was yelling at me I told her I had proof I bought yellow curry and I could come in and show her and the lady continued to yell. This place has proven to me countless amount of times the service is horrible and me and my boyfriend will never return again that even means take out now too."}
{"text":"Gracious people, great food...  It's close to home and delicious.  The owners and staff could not be more hospitable.  Don't miss it if you are hungry in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I ordered from Thai Basil through Amazon. First, Amazon was amazing throughout the entire experience. I called, discussed the issue, and was refunded. Now that that I've added that disclaimer, I'd like to get to the \"meal\" itself. 

I've had drunken noodles at various other Thai establishments around the valley, but this version had to be the absolute worst. I've never had an order that was so bland - I'm pretty sure the only seasoning on it was pepper. The chicken was dry and \"gummy-like,\" likely due to overcooking. As for the ratio of noodles to chick - well, let's just say the noodles were very overpowering.  I ordered a side of rice, which was dry as well. 

After calling the establishment and citing my issues, the only explanation offered was to contact Amazon. At no point did the establishment take responsibility for the quality of its food, but rather, chose to blame Amazon. Therefore, not only was the food terrible, but the staff (at least the one on the phone - supposedly, a manager - if he could call himself such) was unprofessional was well. Ultimately, I don't recommend this place, unless you like bland, dry, and tasteless drunken noodles."}
{"text":"Went to my fav Thai restaurant in Scottsdale, but the water pipes broke so I drove around doing errands. 

Eventually hunger took over and I ran across Thai Basil. Venturing in at lunch rush is never a good idea, service was still good. 

Tables are cramped together so you never feel as though you are eating alone. Ceilings were dusty and bathrooms worn so it made me wonder the conditions of the kitchen???

Food was not the best. Bland and missing all the wonderful flavors Thai food has to offer, I will try another Thai place if my haunt is ever closed again."}
{"text":"Ranks poorly against some of the great Thai restaurants I have visited. The food lacked flavor and color ( Anemic ), The vegetables were of poor quality and a BBQ Chicken we ordered was yellow ? pounded too thin and of questionable quality. Would have enjoyed a non fried appetizer ? some refreshing spring rolls would have been appreciated. We did order some tasty fried calamari, probably the highlight of this forgettable meal. Nothing about this place, including service gave me the impression we would return."}
{"text":"I've been here with friends and family a bunch of times. I've also tried a lot of the menu, which for the most part is delicious. I agree with what some of the others have wrote, that the curry is VERY good. The Musaman (sp?) is unbelievable. But it is weird that their Pad Thai (which I've NEVER had a bad order of anywhere) doesn't taste very good. I was turned off by it, and when I had my girlfriend order it a different time, she said it wasn't good either. 

But I gave it 4 stars because, everything else I've ever had there was very good."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice dinner.
I like the curry dish but everything else is good too.
Always clean and fairly easy access."}
{"text":"Order was taken quickly. The food arrived fast. It was good and hot. Prices are comparable to other Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"All the Thai Basil around the valley is confusing me!  Make sure you pay attention next time someone says lets meet at Thai Basil's - get the location down before acting.  Anyways, Thai Basil's aren't the same everywhere - certain locations taste better than others.  This one is decent and yes they can get spicy - real spicy - youch!  The decor is classic Thai artwork and portraits, I can dig.  Our waiter; which looked like a 15 year boy (Asians - maybe he older than he looks!), was on the ball; more water yes please, can I remove those plates yes please, more water? Okay go away!  If you need a quick fix for Thai food these places are the shiiz, but make sure you can handle your spices :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I usually love Thai basil; however, I made an online order from the yelp app last night. I tried to call the place three times yet it kept going to voicemail so I decided to order online. I got the confirmation email, I even tried calling to make sure the order was received but the phone went start to voicemail again. When we got to the restaurant to pick up the order they did not have it made. They stated the order was lost;however, they read me the order number. I'm very upset this happened and they didn't even apologize or try to make it right."}
{"text":"Service was good, I ordered chicken satay and the chicken was still raw and completely clear in the center, The waitress was nice and replaced it even took it off the bill. Coconut curry was delish but ordered the pad Thai and it tasted like someone poured a bad of sugar on it.  I was left sadly disappointed with the food... I won't be giving them a second chance ."}
{"text":"Good Thai food poor english speaking skills.  They messed up my order.  I tried to explain it to them on how I had the wrong order but the old lady did not understand, neither did her daughter nor did the Mexicans in the back who cooked Thai food."}
{"text":"It's OK Thai food. The pad Thai was decent and while I know it's not supposed to be saucy, it was kind of dry? The tofu tasted funny but I'm no fan of tofu, so for all I know that's how's supposed to taste. 
Spring rolls were good but I didn't care for the corn inside. 
Masaman curry was watery, no rich flavors there. 
The coconut ice cream was delicious!"}
{"text":"The waitress was rude from the start. She tried charging me more than menu price.I heard her complaining about me in the back kitchen. It was my daughter's birthday and she couldn't finish her I'd cream because she rushed us out. While we were driving away she even flipped us off...and o had a 6 year old in the car...inappropriate. Im reporting this place to the BBB NEVER going there again. Also... i want to add that this Thai Basil location is not associated with the Thai Basil chain...this one is family owned and operated."}
{"text":"This place is great. Each dish has unique flavors. Everything is fresh and tasty. Ordered the green mango sakad, crab fried rice, and chicken curry last night. We ordered everything medium spice as my husband is a wimp. It was all delicios. Fast friendly service, clean restaurant and bathroom. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Three stars instead of four because the service was pretty slow even though we were the only seated table for a while. The food was pretty good though and I especially enjoyed my pad thai. Beware ordering a soda- it's pricey and you get a CAN, not a refillable fountain drink."}
{"text":"Nice server, but VERY slow! Didn't get our food until an hour after... Also make sure you check your bill, they upcharged a few dollars on each entrees.. Most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Unfortunately after picking up a few dishes for take out I found a FLY in one of my dishes. I was unable to get back that evening for a refund  but was assured the person in charge we could stop by and get our money refunded the next day.  I was told the next day by the manager that she would only refund the money for the dish with a fly in it.  We explained we threw away all the food (who would eat from a restaurant that had a fly in it). But she insisted that I was unreasonable and wanted to give me a new dish.  I like to support my local businesses but what terrible service.  Thanks Thai Basil but I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"We loved our soup and Thai basil chicken lunch!  Just the right spice and great Thai dishes!"}
{"text":"The BOMB thai food - and the best choice for a vegetarian.  I am a vegan, and how often can you actually eat almost everything on the menu?  Thai Basil will make all of their dishes with tofu or vegetables, and they don't use chicken stock to cook with so it's all fair game.  The service is consistently superior, it's super quick and very clean."}
{"text":"Great food, I love the green curry with tofu! Mango sticky rice for dessert was amazing. Staff is friendly the place is clean and they get the food out to you quick"}
{"text":"I usually order green curry because I love the eggplant here-- and then order it Thai Hot for extra heat.  The atmosphere is very cozy and relaxed."}
{"text":"Heard good things, but, did not even measure up. Very bland...really man? It's Thai how can it be flavorless? Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and very friendly 
Warm atmosphere 
Clean
Our food came out right away and was very tasty
Will be back
Nicely priced for the two of us
Even the bathroom was clean
Great job"}
{"text":"So I've been craving Thai food.

This place is fairly close to me, I decided to try the Red Curry with Tofu , my daughter had the Chicken Noodle with beef. (see pics)

The sauce part was perfect, spicy and slightly sweet of coconut, BUT the tofu was spongy and tough and the bamboo shoots were awful and tasted like bleach? 
The egg-roll was my favorite part that spicy sweet sauce they serve it with is so damn good!

Val really liked her dish, I'm not  fan of beef but I tried a noodle and it had really good flavor.

The glasses were really clean and the water tasted filtered. Generous portions and affordable prices.
OK place, but I probably wont go back seeing as I didn't like their Tofu and that would be my filling of choice."}
{"text":"The worst place I have ever been. The service was horrible and the food was even worse. If u are someone who values customer service this isnt the place for you."}
{"text":"I am leaving Thai Basil incredibly disappointed. I just waited 45 minutes to get my take out order while tables that had come in after me were served and finished their meal. I asked the flustered server if the bag on the counter was my order waiting and was told no. After staring at this bag for at least 20 minutes I figured that since no one had come in to claim it that I would ask again. I read the receipt on the bag and it matched my order so I told the server and he said oh yes it is ready. I grabbed the bag,frustrated that my cold order had been ready the entire time and the server was too busy( 3 tables) to look close enough or even acknowledge how long I had been sitting there. The worst part is that there are items missing from the bag and I'm too hungry and upset to go back. The food is great but tonight the service was miserable."}
{"text":"We busted moved to Awatukee from Tempe where we ate at Thai Basil all the time. This location is no exception, food is really tasty and fresh. Our go to is usually chicken pad thai, or the red curry extra hot. Occasionally do the tom yum, or Thai basil(rice special). I wish they delivered."}
{"text":"This is now forever called \"Lie Basil\" in our house. Normally we go to the one in Tempe on Rural. It was our spot. Then we moved to this area and got excited that Thai Basil was nearby. We were disappointed that the place was ENTIRELY different than the other. Why name a place the same as another? Hence...Lie Basil."}
{"text":"We've traveled the world and search for Thai food wherever we go.  From Bangkok to Myrtle Beach, without doubt we've eaten some great meals.  But there's no place we love more than Thai Basil in Phoenix.  

When it comes to delicious Thai cuisine, Patrida and Norman Fite run one of the best restaurants ever.  And, the service?  Exceptional.  There was a time when they had a difficult manager, we'd eat there anyway (it was kind of like going to Seinfeld's Nazi Soup Kitchen!).  That manager has been gone for over a year, Patrida is there many days of the week, and the feeling of Zen has returned.  

We love you, Patrida.  We're sad we've moved away.  Dinner last night was DELICIOUS!  But food aside, seeing you made our night!  Trust me, if we're ever within a 100 miles of you and Thai Basil, we're eating lunch and dinner at your place until it's embarrassing!"}
{"text":"Very nice Thai restaurant with lots of dishes you won't find in most Thai places.  Pay attention to the specials on the boards.  They have several great dishes you won't find on the menu.  The food was very good and the waitress was very polite and helpful.  The food runner/water girl didn't speak English.   It would be nice to teach her something like \"your welcome\", etc.  The place was pretty empty on a Monday night.  I'll probably be back.  The fish cakes were a little over done and my drunken noodles had too many noodles...but both were very good and tasty otherwise.  They really know how to spice things up...so if you're use to ordering 10, go for 5 and use the spice tray on the side...I didn't need to and I always order 11 elsewhere."}
{"text":"A date night favorite!

Small, cozy and romantic little spot with nice lighting. Get away from the Chain restaurants and relax with delicious food, wonderful aromas and good prices. My boyfriend and I have been here about 4 times in the past year and have loved every dish. The egg rolls are delicious and I order the lamb with fried rice dish which is incredible. I just keep ordering it because I love it.

He likes spicy food and puts hots sauce on everything and he has never complained about the medium spiced food. 

The service is good and I noticed once we started visiting more and we always tip 20% or more, the staff are very welcoming and nice. I think that goes for every restaurant but just a tip for those who want better service when they eat out."}
{"text":"The food is very good, especially the coconut shrimp. Go to the Ahwatukee TB and be entertained by the funny Thai Grandmother, and if you're lucky, you will hear a heated conversation from some of the authentic Thai=talking servers. Priceless!"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was not that good. Very surprised to hear this is the best place in Phoenix. The pad Thai has no sauce on it just crushed peanuts and not a lot of flavor. The lady on the phone was confusing and frustrating to talk to. I paid another $2 for some brown rice and it wasn't good either. I give it 2 stars based on the pad Thai. Maybe other dishes are better and that is why they receive all the rave in ahwatukee. Going to try other places even though this is really close to our house."}
{"text":"Always great service at this location! The owners seem like they are family oriented and care about the level of service they provide! I will continue eating here as long as I live in Ahwatukee because it has consistently been a solid choice!"}
{"text":"This place has become my new favorite!  I've ordered take-out each time and have received excellent service!  The food is simply amazing.  The Pad Thai not only has huge portions, it's exactly how Pad Thai should taste.  The Thai Iced-Tea is a great addition to any order.  I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Awful. Ordered a $12 soup. Chicken curry. Not only was it overpriced for its size, it was slammed full of bay leaves, overpacked with mushrooms, and literal sticks all through out my soup. First and last experience here. I will not return."}
{"text":"Place real good. Great tasting food. Come hang out at their tiny restaurant or do take out. Either way its really good. 

\"I like\"

Eugene"}
{"text":"The atmosphere there is great and the food was fantastic.  Very authentic and they were very mindful that we were a bunch of caucasians that likely wouldn't be able to handle the heat and offered more mild menu choices.  I've been there half a dozen more times and had a very consistant experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! We took our one year old and they were very accommodative bringing us a bowl and spoon to share our food with her. They get our waters refilled and didn't rush us, and best of all they were super nice about the mess we left behind."}
{"text":"3-3.5 stars

Went for lunch and ordered some pad thai. Decent amount of food for a fair price. It's a small restaurant but fast and friendly service. They pad thai is decent."}
{"text":"My family and I crave their food weekly! The service has always been great. My favorites are the Panang and the Thai Basil. Great vegetarian options too."}
{"text":"I love this place. I get the pad Thai. The people who work here could be a bit more outgoing but the ordering process is short, they've never messed up an order and they are quick-which let's face it, we all like fast and convenient."}
{"text":"We love Thai food...and have had a good luck with other Thai Basil's (Oregon location).   This location on a Saturday night was not very busy (mostly takeout).  We dined in...and the service was not very good.  There was one gal handling everything...seating, phones, takeout and waiting on tables.  Three of us ordered Pad Thai w/ chicken.  However,  it came w/ Tofu...actually more tofu then chicken, AND it was not very good.  Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"After Keegan's would take my dinner order over the phone because it was too small, I called Thai Basil and as always, DELICIOUS!!! Always fast, tasty food served with a smile!!! Red curry chicken is my favorite!"}
{"text":"So I made an order over the phone picked it up. I got home and checked and it was the wrong curry.... I called and I nicely stated my frustration to the guy on the phone. He told me he will talk to the manager, a minute later the manager picked the phone and the first words out of her mouth were \"WHATS WRONG\" in a yelling tone. I said \"You handed me the wrong order and I would like a refund. My order was this... and I got this... I am throwing it away\". She refused to REFUND ME. Had to wait 30 minutes and they delivered my order and I gave them the wrong order just in case that manager thought I was lying (the way she was asking me questions made it seem like she is not believing I did not get my order). She is rude and disrespectful, please do not support this location."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to try this place because of the current rating but actually, after my experience, I think it should have a little more credit. Came here for lunch with my dad and I ordered the green curry. It said it had eggplant in it which I love, but there were only two pieces of eggplant in it. My dad even commented that they don't give enough meat. He ordered the red curry. While that is so, I found the food to taste good and the server was very attentive. There were also a good amount of people there having lunch."}
{"text":"Been to a few Thai restaurants in the area, and this one seems to be consistently the best food. Portion sizes large, and they will make it as spicy as you would like...service is good and the food arrives fast. The only negative remark I would make is that an older waitress would walk around and pass gas while serving food. I may not return due to this."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about my lunch here yesterday.  

The service was friendly and gracious, but we were seated on a cluttered patio at a table with a dirty tablecloth with a cigarette hole burned right through it.  (The table next to us had a pile of cigarette ashes on top of it from the older lady that runs the place, she hastily put her cigarette out as we pulled up, but not before accidentally ashing on the table top.  Yuck.)

Anyway, we were seated and immediately given ice waters and small bowls of the most delicious clear broth soup even before we ordered.  The soup was seriously amazing, one of the best clear broth soups I've ever had.  We both ordered the Thai Basil Specialty, one order with chicken and one with tofu.  Within 5 minutes our food had arrived and we started eating, but I was confused, why was there no sign whatsoever of any basil IN my Thai Basil dish?  None.  The dish was good, albeit salty, but otherwise palatable.

I'd probably come back here again, but I certainly won't sit on the patio again, unless they clean it up; it's mess and really needs to be cleaned and organized, the table linens need to be washed."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken pad Thai and had it delivered to my work. The food was not as spivey as I liked and the noodles were a bit dry. However it was still good and they were nice enough to deliver it for me. I still need to give it another try before I say I love or hate because. Overall great customer service."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place because it's relatively close to our house. The prawns on our salad were not cooked all the way, and the Tom Yum Gong soup was bland. Not sure how you can make that soup bland, but they did it. The under-cooked food was enough to cure me for life - I won't go back."}
{"text":"Our experience at Thai Basil was sub-par at best. The chicken satay that came with the appetizer sampler was decent, but the rest of the items (fried sweet potato, fried tofu, spring rolls) did not have a crispy enough coating. Perhaps even worse, the coating tasted more like one that belonged on a corn dog than on an Thai morsel. 

When we had finished our appetizers, the waiter brought out our spicy clear noodle dish, but not our beef red curry. We decided not to wait to start eating and dove into the noodle dish. It tasted like noodles sauteed in hot sauce and...that's it. In my opinion, good noodle dishes have a complexity - for example, a good pad Thai has hints of tamarine, peanut, lime, and fish sauce. This noodle dish had one level to it, and the one level wasn't even that good. 

About 10 minutes later, the waiter returned with our red curry, started to set it down on the table, and then hurriedly excused himself, going back to the kitchen with the dish. 5 minutes later, he returned with the same dish and apologized, saying that before \"it was too rare.\" Well, it was now the opposite of rare - tough and chewy. Additionally, the curry sauce was thin and milky-tasting, not thick and properly balanced between the spice and coconut milk. Oh, and in case it wasn't bad enough already, the rice was chewy and a bit dry as if it had been made the previous day. 

So that was our experience at Thai Basil. Not great. Not even good. To be fair, the check was very low for such a decent amount of food, but I would have rather spent $20-$30 more and had a good Thai meal at Wild Thaiger or Malee's Bistro."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch on a whim.  Simple, informal and direct - but the food was amazing. We actually got a little emotional.  I had the house special and she tried the garlic chicken.  We both said that we wanted to come back the very next day for lunch!  Affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Foods are outstanding! I have been here with my friends over ten times and never get disappointed. Our waiter Zhu is a very considerable server. Always come here to check and refill water at about the right time. They really does an excellent job! I will bring more friends to here!"}
{"text":"I asked the waiter, \"What's your most popular dish\" he told me, Thai Basil dish.  So, that's what I ordered along with Tom Kha soup. 

I figured since it was lunch time, the waiter would bring out a cup of soup, instead he brought out a Pot.  He should have asked if I was eating for 4.  I was having lunch alone, by the way. The tom kha soup tasted like it was missing something,  perhaps flavor?? The thai basil dish had too much bamboo shoots.  I'm not a panda! Come on, really, you're most popular dish?!"}
{"text":"We went to the Ahwatukee location to celebrate my niece's birthday. This place had pretty good food and a nice location. However, I have never experienced such terrible service before in my life. When we walked in, there were a few people seated and eating, but it took 5 minutes for someone to even come out and greet and seat us. I have never seen anyone so outwardly unhappy to be in a place! The waitress did not want to be there and she wanted everyone to know it. The food came out quickly and was delicious, however, it did not make up for the terrible service. Then, when the check came, we were overcharged for one of the meals. The waitress claimed that the prices had changed, however none of the menus reflected the price she was trying to charge us. We could hear her yelling in the back complaining about us. While we were trying to leave, she stood and glared at us until we walked out. Once outside, she slammed the door behind us. Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I loved the small pieces of fried tofu in the Pad See Ew.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  The owner is also great too.  I'd highly recommend this if you need a great lunch in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered the spicy green beans with tofu and the spicy fried rice. The beans were crunchy and flavorful. I liked that the pieces were cut to the right length, not kept long which adds to the aesthetics but then I need to cut it all up! The rice was ok, though I like rice to not be overlooked. The rice here was on the overly cooked side. Bc of the kids, we made the food mild... My experience with the triple Thai hot will have to b carry out. The lady taking our order was cheery, and knowledgeable on making suggestions. Her smile made me feel she welcomed our patronage and that deserves an extra star

Update: I got the triple Thai hot on my mixed vege tofu....was tasty but not hot. Disappointing, bc I did carry out so I didn't have the sauces they have in the restaurant on hand."}
{"text":"3 stars - I've been here multiple times and prior to the last experience they would have gotten 4 stars.  Last time I went I ordered pad thai - it was dry, cold, and bland.  What the heck happened here?  Usually the pad thai and spicy noodles were consistently good.  Sad to have experienced such a drop in quality.  Hopefully next time is better."}
{"text":"Co-workers and I have been coming to this location for a few years now.  It was one of our favorites until they hired a new manager named Taika.  She used to work at Yuppha's Thai restaurant (used to come to this one too until they moved their location a few years back).  Taika always give us an attitude everytime we ask for something different like changing white to brown rice.  Came here today and when we got our food, it was not even warm.  Asked her why food wasn't hot and she grabbed the plate and said she'll microwave it for us... in a very very rude fashion!

Food was ok.  Noticed there wasn't much meat in my curry.  I can see the discoloration (brown spots) on the potatoes.  Curry tasted watered down.  Will definitely not be going to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is very inexpensive and yet delivers a great value!  We ordered Chicken green curry and a tofu yellow curry. It came with a veggie broth soup first. With our dishes came a veggie spring roll and steamed rice. Food was excellent, service was super fast and friendly. Check was $17.20 for two guests."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but you never know what you'll get. I don't think I've ever actually received what I've ordered. Chalk it up to a language barrier, but even pointing on the menu doesn't help. 
On the plus side, the food is delicious and I've had the opportunity to try lots of different things on there menu."}
{"text":"Well..... I have mixed experiences with the different locations of Thai Basil around the valley. This location was not the best. I picked up food from TB for lunch one day and it was decent. I had the panang curry with chicken, which is so delish at the downtown location, but was just ok at this location. It wasn't spicy enough for me despite my ordering it spicy. There are many Thai restaurants in the east valley, so I probably would not return to this Thai Basil location."}
{"text":"I have read great reviews about this place however I decided to try Thai Basil for the first time and was extremely disappointed.

I ordered the Red Curry. The flavor itself was great however my rice was so over cooked it almost had a mashed potato like texture. The vegetables in my curry were pretty much mush.

We also ordered the Satay and the chicken has this extremely rubbery texture. 

Needless to say I will never come back. If you want some great Thai food visit Pink Pepper or Yuphas in Tempe"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I'm in Ahwatukee . The food is always good and the people are always friendly. I'm a big fan of curry especially yellow chicken Thai hot. They continuously strive to add new menu items. The appetizer soup is fresh and tastes very good."}
{"text":"Love Thai Basil, everything I've tried is really good. My favorite is the Thai Basil with chicken & the spicy fried rice with chicken or shrimp."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the Ahwatukee location yesterday.  Food was great as usual.   Waitress was the worst I've ever experienced.   Walks away from you when you ask a question.   Doesn't bring what you ask for.   Rude to all the customers.   This place won't last with her serving the guests!"}
{"text":"Chicken pad thai very good both in quality and taste and the portion is good as well - the location is small with limited parking and the poor culture - service etc usually off sets the value of the food - too bad because there is good potential"}
{"text":"We will never visit this location of Thai Basil again and I suggest you avoid it, as well.

The service is SO bad now.  Let me repeat: the service is AWFUL.  The last two times we have visited, the RUDE staff has completely ignored our table with the exception of stopping by to take our order and then deliver it.  It is just nonexistent service.

The food?  Bland.  I hate to be blunt but JUST BECAUSE I AM WHITE does not mean I like bland food!  I have ordered my dishes THAI HOT, which is supposed to be the hottest level of food and I actually felt comfortable giving my 4 year old daughter (who thinks black pepper is spicy) some of the vegetables from my dish.  

Honestly, just head a few miles down the road and go to another Thai Basil if you must."}
