{"text":"Your friendly neighborhood diner with a specialty in Greek food.   The place was welcoming and had what seemed to be regulars coming in and out while we were there. It had your average diner menu. The service was good and friendly. The food was like your average diner quality.   I had the clubhouse with a side of home fries. The home fries were very good and the clubhouse was decent. They also had an all day breakfast menu which we enjoyed. No complaints.   This is a good local diner."}
{"text":"UPDATE  Best breakfast deal in this area: $5.95 for 3 eggs, 3 bacon or 3 sausages, home fries, 2 slices of buttered toast with their home made jam (flavor changes periodically), water served in chilled glasses AND complimentary Brazilian coffee with free refills served all day! Free WiFi, free neighborhood parking along the side streets and friendly, easygoing staff.  Most places don't include coffee with their breakfast specials or the specials are available only during a limited time frame, so I gotta bump them up another star. When I need some coffee with my breakfast or I'm in the mood to have breakfast for lunch or dinner, I'll be coming here.  TIP: mix the Heinz ketchup and Sriracha for a yummy dipping sauce."}
{"text":"We had a good diner breakfast. The home fries were delicious. One woman did everything while this lazy dude sat. She took the order, cooked our breakfast and did dishes. She is a machine!"}
{"text":"The food was above average. The hollidaise sauce was good and poached egg to perfection for my Benny."}
