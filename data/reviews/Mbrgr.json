{"text":"It's not so much the prices that bother me about this place- it's the value they fail to support. I'd like to think that an $18 stand-alone burger would be worth every mouth-watering penny I paid for it- and in some places it is- just not here.   Listen to the other reviewers here: walk another block west and just go to Craft Burger. Looking for more of a sit down environment? You're in luck! Temple Bar is en route and also serving up some delicious burger fare."}
{"text":"I seemed to walk by here constantly but never go in. Then I got a coupon, so I thought I'd try it out. I've read a couple of reviews on here, and I'd have to agree with what they say. It's alright, but really not worth it for the price.  It's spacious, the decor is fine and the wait staff were nice. We had the kobe beef burgers and it was alright, but not amazing. For this price, I'd expect it to be better. Even with the coupon it was pricey.  It's too bad. I've been looking for a decent go-to restaurant in the area, but I don't think this is the one."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the one in Montreal and was happy when I heard they were moving the build-your-own-burger concept down the 401. Try a whole wheat bun with well done bacon, cheese and a side of sweet potato fries. Finish with deep-dish chocolate cookie. Pure burger bliss. Highly recommend. Thank me later."}
{"text":"We are always open for \"new\" ideas in restaurant fare. Count burgers out. You can make them ever so good, they still are \"only\" burgers, what the kids order from the bottom of the menu at a fancy restaurant.  The ambiance is restrained and really quite stylish, but for the price we expected much more.  It seems as if the chef wanted one thing, really fancy and high priced gourmet food and the interior designer a more plain version. - The mix doesn't feel right.  Keep on working, bring the prices down and we will be prepared to stand in a line for a superb value (still to come) in a nice looking but very noisy restaurant. (What is wrong with sound absorbing ceilings, so seldom seen in Toronto?)  Our meal was tasty and served hot. The staff and our server was friendly and very competent, a nice touch. But $ 22 +tip each for a hamburger and a small draft beer? Pricey.  I'll wait for the next 1/2 price offer in my email inbox."}
{"text":"Bought the $40 voucher from Wagjag for $20. Went there for lunch with my co-worker at around 12:45. The place wasn't crowded at all. I got the AAA Canadian beef burger with pulled pork, mozzarella, roasted pepper, and portobello mushroom. My co-worker got AAA burger, pulled pork, friend egg, caramelized onions, and portobello.  Overall the burger was really good. The pulled pork topping is really good ($6 extra), but it overpowers the taste of the beef patty itself, because the sauce is pretty intense. The beef patty was really tender itself too.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was better/different than most burger joints. This place look quite like an upscale dining restaurant.  Would I go back there? Maybe if I can get another 50% off voucher. Otherwise there's no way I'm spending $45 for two burgers."}
{"text":"It's official Mbrgr is closed for good. It seems that gouging customers on substandard food is a great way to go out of business."}
{"text":"I attended a soft opening of this spacious second floor King West newcomer. This is not a newcomer to burgers... I've been a big fan of the Montreal location since it opened a couple years ago. To customize your AAA, organic or kobe burger there are a variety of mouthwatering toppings that range from smoked bacon to shaved truffles (prices range too). The location includes fully stocked bar with a variety of wines though sadly they've not brought the Quebec microbrews with them.   The sesame buns are fresh and just large enough to allow for several add-on toppings. I chose buffalo mozzarella, bacon, caramelized onion, horseradish mayo and of course a fried egg (I shied away from the Michigan sauce - aka chili - on this visit). Of course it was tasty, the burger alone tastes great with the right balance of saltiness and seasoning. Famous Moishe's coleslaw is a nice side along with a basket of sweet potato fries.  Oh and there are various other non-burger items on the menu - don't let the name fool you. I have never ordered anything else here but the poutine looked great and was certified as excellent by a young girl sitting at the table behind me. Desserts also look very tempting but my burger and sides were filling enough.  Pulled pork sandwiches, chicken, tuna and even mac and cheese are vegan options (to me a vegan is anyone who doesn't eat beef).   With several Montreal-based team members relocated to Toronto I think Mbrgr should see a successful opening this month."}
{"text":"We visited M:Brgr about 4-5 days after it opened and overall it is a great location and nice environment.  Server and hostess were great.  I had a standard beef burger with some additional toppings and shared a side of regular fries and a sweet potato fries.  Overall, the burger was good but not great.  The meet was slightly overdone and not overly juicy and the bun (whole wheat) was nowhere near the freshest or best I have had.  However, the fries were both excellent (although too salty for my taste).  Overall, a good burger but given the number of options for places to have a burger in the city, this would not be at the top of my list, especially for comparably priced places."}
{"text":"I went to M:BRGR for the 1st time last night. I would have to say that my experience was fairly on par with what others have mentioned thus far. The only reason that I went was because I had purchased a deal via Wagjag (spend $20 get $40), otherwise, I think it's rather ridiculous to charge $8.75 for a basic hamburger before adding any toppings (this place is not Mortons or the Four Seasons ;-)).  Setting price aside, I had no complaints regarding the food itself. I actually elected to try the Chicken Burger, while my cousin ordered the standard AAA burger. He ordered it on a white bun, with cheese and bacon. The slice of cheese cost an extra $1.25 and the two strips of bacon cost an additional $2.50. He also ordered a small serving of fries which cost $4.00. I had a taste of the fries and they seemed rather standard. I did not try the burger, though, I asked him how it tasted and he said it was fine.  My chicken burger (which cost $9.75) was served on a whole wheat bun, with some shredded lettuce and with a few slices of tomato. It came with a pesto mayo which was served on the side (the waiter did not ask me if I wanted it served on the side).  We also ordered a beer each. I had the Wellington Pale Ale ($6.50) and he had a Steamwhistle which was on tap ($4.50).  For dessert we split the deep dish chocolate chip cookie with ice cream ($10.00). I had read about this one from prior posts and it definitely did not disappoint.  With taxes, our total bill came to $53.47. Normally that would seem rather outrageous for a burger joint. With the discount, the bill came to $33.47 which is a little more reasonable for two people (considering we ordered beers and dessert in addition to our mains).   A few other points to note:  - Now that I think of it, the waiter did not ask my cousin how he wanted his burger cooked (which should be an absolute requirement); - I arrived at 730 on a Friday night, and there was plenty of space. Definitely no need for a reservation; - The decor was acceptable and the restaurant was appropriately lighted, however I do second another person's post regarding the cafeteria style chairs. Nothing to write home about there, but I probably wouldn't dock them any stars because of them. - The noise level was high, but not unbearable; - The wait staff was rather prompt and answered all of our questions; - We did not have to wait too long for our food. Even after lingering for a bit after we had settled the bill, it was still only 9pm by the time we departed.  Conclusion: if the website would let me do it, I'd probably give a 3.5. If the prices were a bit more reasonable I would be willing to give a 4. Given the expense, it's unlikely that I would return to M:BRGR without another coupon. If I have a craving for a burger, I'll go down the st. (like others have mentioned) to Craft Burger."}
{"text":"Damn your location and classy inviting decor which made me think I was in for a burger delight.    It's so easy to walk by m:burger after going to Branthouse or another lounge and think to yourself, \"this place must have great burgers\".  This is one of those few times you SHOULD NOT listen to your inner self.   The burgers are super boring, super expensive, the bread sucks and it comes with few toppings if you just order the burger, topping are extra.  Yes, they have the $100 burger (I don't know who's tried it), but even $10 for their \"AAA\" burger is beyond reason because the burger it self just isn't good.  Add soem toppings and you're looking at $15 for your below average meal."}
{"text":"COMPLETE and utter waste of a $30 burger.  Ordered the kobe beef burger on a whole wheat bun, grilled portobello mushrooms, caramelized onions, and brie.  First of all - they don't even ask you how you like your burger cooked (hello, a well done kobe beef burger? uh, i think NOT!).  Secondly, it took about 45 minutes to get our order (we were literally the ONLY patrons in the restaurant aside from the people in the bar- why would it take this long?).  I was too hungry to even tell them about my dissatisfaction with the way my burger was cooked for the fear that it would take another 45 minutes.  The only saving grace about this burger is the truffle aioli that came on the side.  On the plus side - they DID give us a coupon for a free desert with our next meal. But would I spend $30 on a mediocre (at its best) burger again? I think not."}
{"text":"I had the organic burger was good at first bite.. but then it got boring soon after.. and i really didn't like the cafeteria style chairs.. if i'm paying 20 ish dollar for my meal, i don't ant to sit on cafeteria chairs."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is perfectly fine, until you check the prices!!   Maybe part of my dismay with the exorbitant burger prices in Toronto is because I came here from NYC and you can get some damn good burgers for pretty cheap in NYC (I'm looking at you Corner Bistro and White Horse Tavern. And I am drooling).  Mbrgr takes expensive and raises it to insane!  The only reason we went is because I got one of those daily deals (can't remember which one - Groupon has sort of become the XEROX of daily deals, hasn't it?), so my price was half off. And really, that's the only way I would go because the prices are double what they should be.  Who cares if the food is any good or if the service or decor is good if they are charging DOUBLE what they should charge? Really. I am finished with this review now and finished with Mbrgr and so should you be.  Just bbq a burger at home. It'll taste better and be much more affordable. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Ended up here since our original destination (Burger's Priest) could not accommodate our group of six, and was pleasantly surprised to find a rather spacious and stylish interior.  Our group was comfortably seated in a corner area and were promptly greeted by our server.  I ordered the approx $20 Kobe beef burger; there happened to a special for this burger which included cheddar, truffle aioli and french fries for $23.50 -- to which I added a few extra condiments and upgraded to sweet potato fries which put my entree at close to $30.  By the time I had added my single glass of wine, my total tab for the meal including tax and tip was about $54.  The burger was good (but certainly not the best I've had), so the price point (for a burger, some fries and a glass of wine) made me feel like while the overall experience was fine, I wouldn't be raving about the place to my friends or rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"Oh god I hate this place so much.  I used to think it was impossible to ruin the simple art of the hamburger.  You can cover it in oil, douse it in sauce, slice it in quarters, replace the bun with lettuce, even make it out of unicorn meat.     It does not change the simple fact that this is as close as you can come to a perfect food.  Then why does M:BRGR fail so miserably?  It's a multifaceted problem.     Being in the heart of King West is usually a mood-kill in itself, but other burger joints like Craft are able to make the most of being an oasis of meat on a street full of meat-beaters.     M:BRGR takes a different approach altogether, actually ratcheting up the douchebag quotient by coating the decor in faux sophistication, dark interior and date-rape aesthetic.   You want to shower before you've had a single bite.  The hamburger is supposed to be the most simple of foods.   The sure-fire bet on a gamble of a menu.   M:BRGR decides to remove this ease by making the ordering process the most complex endeavor in the history of the restaurant business.     Half of the ingredients offered you cannot pronounce.  The other half you do not want.    All of them you cannot afford.   You need to use calculus to decide what you're eventually going to order.   You still fail the final exam.   You feel stupid and want to drop the class.    The restaurant makes the massive mistake of buying into the idea that \"price\" is the most important variable on a menu.    They even name one of their concoctions \"the hundred dollar burger\".  The last place to name a burger after a price point was Carl's Junior with the \"Six Dollar Burger\"... and that was an ironic piece of fast-food art that actually cost $3.39.    The hundred dollar burger actually costs one hundred dollars.  It's just plain stupid.      It's not that expensive burgers are not good...  Bymark's is one of the best plates in town.  Mildred's Temple has a wonderfully delicious burger, Oddfellows had a city classic on it's hands...  it's that the goodness of a burger has nothing to do with the price, or with what they say the price should be.    All of this criticism would be rendered moot if the burgers were truly a cut above all other food items in the city."}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is nothing special. Craft burger for one, has it easily beat. I suspect the money they donate to sick kids was simply tacked onto their already inflated prices. And yes, as the previous reviewer says, the burger is mediocre at best.  Steer clear of the poutine if you go. They advertised that it was vegetarian as they make the 'gravy' using portobello mushrooms. Seemed interesting and worth trying. It came with 5-6 monster-sized cheese curds. they didn't melt :( it was like eating soaked fries with cheese golf balls of top. I love cheese, but eating it in semi-melted globs that large simply grosses me out.  extra toppings $1.25 each? WTF? the burgers are pretty spartan. and the patties, not too juicy. honestly, what's up with this burger craze anyway? What Toronto needs is an In N' Out.."}
{"text":"i don't want to be mean, but the burger tasted like something from a church bbq.  even the coleslaw was bad.  how can you mess up coleslaw?!  beautiful surroundings.  very expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here on St. Patty's day for a drink.  The burgers looked good and we were ready to order.  Then we looked at the prices and our jaws dropped.  We decided to stick around for drinks only (which were equally overpriced).  I find it odd that it is so upscale for a place that only serves burgers.  I don't really see the appeal, but maybe its just me.  Service was nothing to brag home about.  Our server kept hitting on the girls in our group and ignored the guys looking to order more drinks.    I'm willing to give this place a second chance, so if ever I'm feeling in the mood for an expensive hamburger I'll think of Mbrgr."}
{"text":"Mbrgr: wanna buy a vowel? oh wait...you might not be able to afford one...  So I have to give it to Mbrgr that they found a way to UPSCALE a burger joint.  Arrived on a Friday evening (9ish) and it was surprisingly sparse.  Regardless of that, our hostess seemed to be a bit particular about where to seat me and my couz.  Wait staff was courteous and attentive.  The wait for food was a tad longish, but like I've said, I appreciate time taken in making fresh food rather than quickly churning out crap on plates.  I ordered a AAA patty ($8.75) on whole wheat with Monteray Jack Cheese ($1.25), Portobello Mushrooms ($2.00), Bacon ($2.50) and Michigan Sauce ($2.50) - more on this later.  My couz ordered a Veg patty ($9.75) on whole wheat w/ Gouda ($2.25), Fried Egg ($1.50), Fried Onions ($1.50), Bacon ($2.50) and Semi-dried Tomatoes ($1.25).  We shared a Poutine w/ BBQ Sauce ($7.75) and washed it down with a pint each.  I'll let you do the math, but the staggering total came out to over $35 each with tax and tip.  FOR BURGERS!  Taking the cost out of the equation (which is a bit hard to do), the beef was actually quite tasty.  And if you're a bit of a burger connoisseur (which seems a bit like an oxymoron to me) and have cash to burn for this experience then this would be the place to go.  They even have a $100 burger which comprises of 2 kobe beef patties, shaved truffle, foie gras,  and topped with the tears of a unicorn (ok no unicorns were emotionally harmed in the making of this burger).  If I give this place another go, I'd probably go a bit simpler to really appreciate the meat.  The toppings are great, but a good burger to me isn't worth it's weight unless it's tasty without all the other distractions.  As for the Michigan Sauce...meh.  The server made it sound all fancy, but in the end when I tasted it alone, it reminded me of the master of all elementary chefs: boyardee.  Haha."}
