{"text":"I'm staying less than 5 miles away. I called for a delivery and was told \"that's outside our delivery area\". Really?"}
{"text":"My friend from New York still raves about the pizza and the mussels. Miss being able to smoke in a restaurant, but once the weather allows, no problem being outside. I was always impressed by the service, at table & behind counter. Wish Reddi's was downtown Cleveland, but worth the drive to Maple Heights (not that far from most places in the metro area). I am raised in New Orleans & wonderful New Orleans' cuisine, but have been a Clevelander for 17+ years. I heartily recommend Reddi's for singles, couples & families for great food & drink, reasonably priced. David Wolf, Cleveland, OH..."}
{"text":"Always amazing! The food is superb and service is fantastic. Anytime we are in the mood for pizza this is our favorite place. With a pitcher of beer and pizza out tab is usually around $20. Not too bad for a pitcher of draft beer and home made pizza with their house made sauce and dough. If you're in the area take a minute to try it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"'Against policy' to charge my phone. Well its dying and Im on the road, thanks a lot. Waitress condescendingly told me to charge it all night next time and walked away laughing after I pleaded..

I ordered the rigatoni lunch special anyway.
I went to the restroom (dirty).
I returned to see my food sitting out.

White and pale iceberg lettuce with a couple olives, some cheap shredded mozz, bulk italian dressing and one pepperoni slice.

One bread roll with one butter packet.

A small plate of COLD rigatoni with flavorless canned tomato sauce and TWO measly meatballs on top.

I had to ask to reheat (microwave) and waitress asked me 'where I went for so long.'

Not worth $8 plus tip IMO.
I am not from here and was very disappointed and feel like my poor treatment had to do with the way I was dressed."}
{"text":"I got a small pizza delivered to me. They were on time and this pizza is good! This is my first time having them, but I will be ordering again very soon!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza place!!! All homemade and tastes like grandmas. A little on the pricey side for pizza but well worth it. On Wednesdays they have buy one get one for a $1...this is take out or dine in. The atmosphere is a classic mom and pop Italian restaurant. I recommend checking it out and they serve beer and vino!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, a homey feeling pervades. Stop here whenever I can."}
{"text":"Terrible. Ordered sheet pizza through here three times for work potlucks. It never got better. You have to order it the day before for sheet pizzas. 
That's fine but when you get it, the pizza is cold like they made it the day before. I kid you not. I've never seen anything like it. Don't bother. We also get wings. Ugh. Nasty. The sauces are always caked in too much of something, mostly butter so it makes the skin mushy. I just can't."}
{"text":"Google says they're open till 11pm today. We called twice. No answer the first time. The second they said they closed at 8pm. So why did they answer now at 9:30pm? Got a crappy response after we said that their hours are stated to be open till 11pm. That they don't have a site and that we did it wrong. No.. We didn't. Your business page says the times. We didn't make it up. Even if their food is good.. We won't ever find out. A response like that was unnecessary."}
{"text":"Nostalgia. I grew up within walking distance and this place is blessedly the same as when I was young. Friendly people and Italian family standards. Everything is familiar and comfortable. Whenever I'm there its like stepping back to my youth. Everything on the menu is tops. My choice is eggplant parmesan sandwich with onion rings. Always PERFECT !!  Please don't miss this gem."}
{"text":"I wanted to get a pizza with a heart in the middle delivered to my boyfriend and the owner went above and beyond! I live in California and the owner accepted my debit card over the phone ( normally you have to pick up when using a card) and I got two large pizzas for only $14! He was super friendly and my boyfriend loved it :)"}
{"text":"normally the food is pretty good here but the last time that was not so .. the ambiance was distracting since the waitress had 2 kids running around & playing in the restaurant .. not to mention watching children's shows on the large TV in the dining room at top volume .. our cheese/garlic bread had hardly any cheese on it & it was served to us cold .. the marinara sauce on the side was cold as well .. thought perhaps they were rationing ice cubes as well since neither of our drinks were served with much ice & they were room temp at best .. had to ask for more ice twice .. small cheese pizza was decent but this diner hopes that the other issues are not going to continue to be the norm in the future or we may have to consider going elsewhere in the future .."}
{"text":"This is some of the BEST Italian food I have had!  I LOVE this place and their chicken parmigiana one the best I've ever tried.  Whether you order take-out or you eat inside, it's a delight for anyone looking to try some family style Italian food that will surely leave you satisfied and wanting to try something else on their vast Italian menu.  The only issue I've had at Reddi's is their parking.  The building itself is literally on a corner and the parking is wrapped around the building.  So, parking can be challenging.  With that said, it can be helpful to plan out your timing for your visit.  This can also be challenging as there are schools and churches within a mile or so heavy traffic on the roads makes exiting the parking lot a chore.  Overall, Reddi's is DEFINITELY worth a try if you're in the area and are looking for some very nice and authentic family style Italian food."}
{"text":"I ordered Pizza, wings and a large salad that served two people.
The wings I ordered plain with bbq sauce on the side and extra extra crispy.

When I got my order, the lady gave me a small salad and tried to charge me for another to make it a large, and the wings were soggy with sauce on them.

The pizza came out good. 
I now know that I'll never order anything but pizza from Reddis again."}
{"text":"Another Cleveland pizza place that tries to force you to buy a whole pizza,  I'm a single guy,  I don't need a whole pizza, why won't more pizza places sell slices?"}
{"text":"I went in Monday during lunch as an ace and the only people in there were staff and their children. Warm stinky water melted my ice immediately in was never refilled. The 16 oz Bud Lights cost $5 apparently. The Giant sub is meat and cheese only. No dressing no vegetables. The onion rings were frozen fresh out the bag from the basement. Not quite sure if they even have an apron in there for the cooks. Asked them about the pizza one of the regulars or owners walking by told me it was horrible and not to get it but I got one to go anyways thinking it was a joke. The decor is old the service is old and the menu is dated. Can't really speak out for the food quality as I just had a sub but basing it on a sub , it's not good. I really should give a one-star but something needs to offend me for that happen. The only reason why that place is still open probably is they own the property and just have to pay taxes otherwise for my second time there I will never be back. It's not one to like to trash-talk places but that place really needs an overall two I'd prefer to give great reviews. Two Bud Lights, cheap onion rings, cheap sandwich, and a cheap pizza. $40... see ya later"}
{"text":"A pizza restaurant that is completely off the grid, and who knows why. I was in the neighborhood, met up with an associate while he ate dinner here with his family. As soon as I walked in, I noticed the ferris wheel style oven. Very similar to the one in Danny Boy's. I know that the oven plays just about as big of a role in pizza taste as the ingredients, but this pizza reminded me of Danny Boy's. The sauce was a little bit thicker with a few more spices. As a whole I prefer this place to Danny Boy's or Angelo's. I think it was one of the better pizza slices that I have had in Cleveland recently. The prices are also way lower than Danny Boy's. I hope that you are feeling adventurous and try this excellent, sit down restaurant out. I am glad I did and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A small disclaimer before beginning my review. My first job was at Reddi\"s when I was 16 years old (almost 25 years ago). So I know what goes into making their pizza. I got to savor the smell of their homemade sauce. I balled up the fresh made dough, and sliced the fresh mushrooms. Everything was done right, and it showed in the quality of their food. I brought my kids here to relive the experience, and was pleasantly surprised to see that absolutely nothing has changed! I mean nothing, the restaurant looked exactly the same, and the food tasted exactly the same, which is to say that it was delicious! We had a pizza and some cheesy garlic bread, and my kids enjoyed it just as much as I did. Reddis is a testament to the value of a small, neighborhood restaurant which is actually run by a family, and not a corporation.  Thanks for staying true guys!"}
