{"text":"The pizza was delicious as was the antipasto salad.  Everything was made to order, fresh and delicious.  One of the owners, Maria, came over and chatted with us. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  We would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza - huge slices and great dough/sauce. The breadsticks are also incredible. Would 100% come back. Super friendly staff made the experience that much better!"}
{"text":"Hey it's all about the pizza not ambiance. Pizza is great by the slice or to go and that is what this place is about. Best pizza in the area. We go there to drop in and get a few slices for a little while and keep moving."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and salad and was told 30-40 minuets. Called after an hour and was told 15 minutes. I asked if not here than it is free? Got a smart ass answer. Regardless not a good way to do business."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the east side craving pizza, and not one of the other 900 amazing restaurants within walking distance of this place, and you just absolutely have to have a big slice of $3.50 pizza, then....well, think hard on it, and if you just can't wait, and don't want to spend a bunch and you feel you body digesting itself, then head on in get ready for the most \"nothing special\" slice ever.  Because, let's be clear, the two best things this place has going for it, is the fact that you can't get a \"slice\" of pizza really anywhere else in the area (which means it can compete with the fast food price point), and it's quick (again competing with fast food).  This place kind of defines \"utility pizza\".    If you NEED pizza, and I mean \"fuck I need a slice!!\", then go here, but if you can help it, don't."}
{"text":"The main reason I chose pizza from here was because of the coupon as advertised on their website: 12 cut 1 topping pizza, whole hoagie, and 2 Liter Pepsi product for $16... Sounded too good to be true, but when I called in my order, and asked about the coupon, they said it was valid. I was told 20 minutes, I was there within 15 minutes of ordering. They would not honor the coupon, even though I showed it to them on my phone on their website... my pizza and hoagie were both cold. I am extremely disappointed and will definitely not be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"Worst Pizza in East Liberty... Nobody ever goes here... Try Pizza Perfecta.. That's the Best pizza ever here in the East End. Shadyside finest pizza is on the the corner of highland and Alder."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!  Only second time, but so far consistently really good and will be ordering again. Great dough, great cheese!  The guys behind the counter have been really pleasant and friendly too.  Would definitely recommend.  Not sure what's up with the other negative reviews? I was hesitant to try after reading them, but my experiences were very positive. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is such a good pizza place. All of the ingredients are fresh and the dough is chewy and delicious. Check out the pepperoni rolls while you're at it, they come with a fantastic house made garlic dipping sauce. Oh, they also deliver, which really makes them my go to pizza spot now."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and variety of choices! The waitors and waitresses were very helpful and cheerful. I will be sure to come back here soon."}
{"text":"This just opened in the place of the old Pizza Sola on Center Ave in East Liberty. They did put some work into the interior, cleaning and upgrading quite a bit. They also brought the menu from the Oakland location on 5th Ave.   I stopped in for lunch and ordered 2 slices, pepperoni and sausage. It was actually not at all crowded for a 12:30 lunch. There were a few people eating at tables and only one other person in the line with me to order. As such, the turnaround time was quite exceptional. They also had a nice lunch selection of \"by the slice\" pizzas, split between traditional red and white styles. The pizza is good here. The sauce has a little spice to it, which I like (I'm not at all a fan of sweet sauces, Mineo's, I'm looking at you...). You also get a hint of that char taste, like its been cooked in a wood oven, which I also like.   Is it a high end pizza, no, but it's more than good enough for lunch, poker night, feed a bunch of kids or timber wolves, i'm too drunk to care. They also have gluten free pizza for those that are intolerant, or just avoiding it.  Last point, and only because I am a geek, they have a tablet based register system that spins around to sign and request an electronic receipt (email, text, etc). Pretty cool stuff that should accelerate things when the lines are longer."}
{"text":"These folks are the best! Best pizza, best staff, best delivery people. I get takeout for lunch and order in for dinner. Best pizza in the East End, easily. And hoagies and rolls, too.   Today, they weren't prepped with enough Sicilian crusts for my early dinner order. They called immediately, explained and offered an alternative. I chose to wait. Their Sicilian pie is well worth a short wait. Still arrived in under 90 minutes from my order time.  Best."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here since they opened this location for business and must say my family and I are always satisfied!  Ingredients are fresh, portions huge, and all at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give a higher review because the pizza is really good. But don't ever try to order delivery. We have twice; once with Grubhub and the other with YelpEat24. Both times our orders were cancelled because at the last minute they didn't have drivers available. If that's the case they shouldn't have shown as active on the apps or taken the orders."}
