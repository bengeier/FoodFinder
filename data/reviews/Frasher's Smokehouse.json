{"text":"Good BBQ is a layback space and generous drinks. The brisket is as tender as butter and baby back ribs have a great smoke.  Your choice of sauce and don't forget to try the gooey butter cake!   It is amazing - like pecan pie without the pecans and the pie is cake!!  It's a great trial of your sugar levels"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Friendly greeting and nice quaint atmosphere. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Quality of the brisket was disappointing for what we paid. if you like a firmer meat instead of fall off the bone, tear with a spoon texture that (imo) smoked meat should have, then this is a great place. Also, NO did between their sweet and spicy sauces."}
{"text":"We decided on eating here on a whim.  The pulled pork was good. The brisket was a little too fatty for my liking. The bbq was good as they offer sweet or spicy.  Everything is charged a la carte. The sides are overpriced.  They informed us the Dr Pepper was not working after we drank the brown soda that \"didn't taste right\". They had a 2 liter sitting on bar instead.  Yet they failed to put an out of order sign on fountain.  May never eat here again as not sure if we came at wrong time or wrong day."}
{"text":"Second time I have been here and I probably wont make a 3rd visit unfortunately. I am a mac and cheese lover and theirs just doesn't cut it. For one it tasted like cheeseless velveta. It was super runny and had no cheddar or real cheese taste. One would think they would use a beschamel and a trio of cheeses and maybe bake it with a crumbly topping.. nope. Just plain and bland. The I got the burnt ends today which was prepared like greasy carnitas is. The pork was fatty and greasy and I've had a stomach ache all day. Would love to offer some recipe tips cause the decor is great, friendly attentive staff, and the owner is always there walking around. We have tried the pulled pork and brisket in the past and that was sub par as well. Such a shame too."}
{"text":"Spent thanksgiving day at Frasher s    It was an awesome experience.  Tenderest turkey. Great stuffing and potatoes.   The Mac n cheese was really really good.  The pumpkin pie was sinful.    just like my grandma Jackson used to make.  Ordered ribs to go.....we I'll be back"}
{"text":"This is one of the best bbq places I've ever been. The food was amazing and so was the service. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Serving size = large. Smoke flavor of meat is perfect. Mac & cheese needed a little salt but that is personal preference. Cornbread and butter cake are delicious. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We just had an amazing lunch here. Hands down the best BBQ I have had in a long time. A couple of Old employees from the original restaurant told me about this place. They bragged about how good the food was. They were right. I can't say enough about how good we thought everything was."}
{"text":"I was truly disappointed in this place.  I drive by this place daily and smell great smoke, so I decided to drop in. I ordered a beef brisket sandwich and fries for 10 bucks plus tax.  Staff was friendly and it wasn't busy, yet it still took about 12 minutes for my sandwich. 
     Although it said that meats are smoked daily, I am absolutely certain this was yesterday's beef.  It was dry and chewy, likely reheated.  I eat BBQ almost weekly and I'm used to brisket being served medium at most with a nice fat layer and a pink smoke ring...not the case here.
     Sadly, I will not return."}
{"text":"On our way to Costco I saw BBQ and decided to try.  When you walk in its a bit dark inside. I ordered the turkey gumbo and my husband ordered the BBR.  He loved that they didn't put the sauce on because he always feel they over add it.  He can add as he wishes. My gumbo was good but not overly excited about it, it was \"just\" good. 
So I liked the place but my husband loved it. Yes, I'll be back and I will recommend it to my friends.
The only recommendation is to have hot sauce."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this week. Needed a break from the usual Biltmore corridor fare. Someone threw out the idea of bbq and this was closest. 

Large place, lots of seating at booths or tables (seat yourself) clean, dark and casual. Sparsely decorated with no real theme or atmosphere and a couple of TVs playing quietly. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Meats come un-sauced and they have three or four different sauces at a central counter you help yourself to. Crowd was sparse and a mix of suits and uniforms  service was friendly and competent and they explained how to order since it was our first time. 

My lunch mate had the pulled pork sandwich which is simply meat in a bun and a side of green chili Mac and cheese. 

I had a two meat combo with brisket and tri-tip and the Mac on the side and ordered a slice of the gooey butter cake for us to share. Combo comes with Texas toast. 

Pulled pork was excellent, smoky and well cooked. The brisket and tri-tip were ok, not horrible, not memorable and all my food, including the toast, was room temperature and dry. Mac and cheese are individual (not suitable for sharing as an FYI) a la carte portions and was tasty and heated through. Drinks are also self service and the ice tea was fresh and it appears they have beer, wine and cocktails. My lunchmate noted that the choices are \"white\" and \"red\" and are $9 a glass, cocktails are $7 and beers are $5, going on memory. 

Combined this very simple meal was about $35.00+ and frankly for that much was not comparable to what you'd get for the same money at many other places in the area, for instance at OSHO a short distance away that serves really great hit and juicy pulled pork, brisket and pastrami sandwiches with good sides in a slightly nicer environment, or for that matter Hillstones at the Biltmore, where we could have eaten for a comparable cost."}
{"text":"All sauces had too much \"cheap\" chili powder in my opinion. Brisket was nice and moist with good ample flavor. 
Baby back ribs were cooked nicely, but the sauces weren't compatible or of good quality."}
{"text":"Great experience! Our first time. Friendly, helpful staff and excellent customer service! The owner George made the rounds to see how everything was. Delicious food! Love that the meats are naked! They were so good they didn't need sauce! Tender lean moist meats, we had pulled pork and brisket. Ribs were meaty but fall off the bone! Best beans my husband's ever had! Would definitely recommend! The only feedback would be to exchange the disposables for more environmentally friendly plates, silverware etc. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Consistent. Outstanding BBQ. Really good ribs fall off the bone. Have to try the ribs, the corn, and the brisket. And all their great sauces. I have ate BBQ all around the states and this is one of the best. Great value as well. 4 meats for $21 and 2 sides."}
{"text":"If you are a meat purist, this is your place. There is little to no seasoning on the meat other than the smoke flavor. All was tender (brisket, pulled pork and tri-tip). Beans were spicy and fries were crisp. Four different types of sauces provide choices and all were good; not too sweet and not too spicy. Not the best BBQ I have had but decent and not dry. Nice vibe."}
{"text":"So as a BBQ enthusiast, and having just got back from Kansas City literally 12 hours ago, I was excited to try this place having just had some of the best BBQ in the country.  I quickly realized these guys share my definition of BBQ.  

I'm not going to comment on the services as I got there a little early so the rush crowd wasn't in, this is a new restaurant and at this point the service is expected to be working out the kinks, and unless the service was either spit in your food terrible, or give them a plaque great it's really pointless to me since its a thankless job anyway.  Having said that they all were working their butts off and was great to be around.

Right as I walked in I was filled with the wonderful aroma of smoldering wood chips giving my future meal the love it deserves.  The place looked rustic with a modern appeal.  The menu had all the great's when it comes to barbecue.  I was absolutely amazed that they had burnt ends!!  My first time having them was in KC 2 days ago and I fell in love.  They had to be mine.

I ordered the baby back ribs and the burnt ends as any lover would do.  I ordered the Mac and cheese also but I as more concerned about the meat.  Right away I noticed the great pink smoke ring on the meat meaning they took their time in the smoker, vs an oven which I appreciate.  Both of them were very tender and filled with the wonderful smoke, and meat flavor that would make a vegetarian blush.  The reviewer before me said that the family is from St. Louis so I was surprised that the burnt ends were chopped up so small.  In KC they are in much larger chunks, but maybe they do it differently in St. Louis.  Still very good though.  

I didn't get a chance to talk with the owner but I did see him walking around talking with the customers, and he seemed like a very nice man.  The midwesterner in me appreciates that.  Some reviewers before me had some complaints about some pretty petty stuff like the tip line on the receipt when ordering from the till.  Get over it.  The only real complaints I have is that the parking lot wasn't very efficient making it difficult to enter and leave.  Coming from an engineering and construction background I notice these things but no big deal.  I also noticed that they need to have misters installed on the patio which can be fixed.  All pretty minor when it comes to the real reason why I came here.  Deliciously smoked meat.  I'm definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"If you are in Phoenix and are looking for really good BBQ you will end your search at Frashers Smokehouse!!! Fast friendly service and excellent food! Doesn't get any better than here!! Mike Kloke, Brookfield, Wi"}
{"text":"I love my ribs. I've eaten ribs in all of the classic BBQ towns in the US... Frasher's ribs rank up there with the very best. The pulled pork was also excellent. The Sweet and Hot sauce, I would happily consume as my beverage for the evening. Mac and cheese? Yum. The service was friendly, energetic and welcoming. The décor is rustic... as it should be for an authentic BBQ joint. Blues tunes add to the ambiance. Quality food, reasonably priced. Overall I really enjoyed the place. I'll be back, often."}
{"text":"I came for the brisket, amazing!...then did the wings, burnt ends, ( cmon they are heavenly), some beers and lemonade, and we finished with the gooey butter cake. ...all was great and can't wait to get back with friends.  Also the place looks great!...great old Americana mural on the wall, and a nice open retro feel throughout.  Can't wait till the bar scene kicks in and we can stay later over some specialty cocktails!  Right now they are so kicking they close when the food sells out!!  That's fresh daily made.food and attest to the quality...maybe another smoker is on the horizon cuz we want more!!!!"}
{"text":"We're back in the Phoenix area for the winter, and yesterday we went to Frasher's Smokehouse.  We used to go to George Frasher's Steakhouse in Scottsdale, but he moved to this location and is doing a bar-b-qua menu.  Oh, my gosh!!  The pit masters at Memphis in May have nothing on this place.  We've been to some of the greatest BBQ restaurants in the country during our extensive travels, and this ranks up there with the best.  My husband had the smoke chicken platter, my sister and I both had the burnt ends, and my brother-in-law had the brisket.  All were amazing!!  meat was tender, smoked nicely, and the sauces were fantastic.  (I mixed the sweet and the Tennessee Tangy sauces, and everyone else had the spicy sauce.)  George, the owner, makes all his sauces from scratch.  The sides are great.  The baked beans also have a great smokey flavor, and is full of chunks of pulled pork.  The corn tastes like it came right off the cob. I got a piece of the gooey butter cake to take home, but I was so full, I didn't get a chance to try it, yet.  (Looking forward to diving into that later today.)   While we were eating, George came over and let us all try one of his ribs (fall off the bone great!), his creamed corn (yummo!), and his cooked greens.  A little later, he brought out two samples of his gumbo and small piece of jalepeno cornbread.  Everything tasted fantastic.  The decor of the restaurant is really cool.  The place has a great vibe.  You would swear you were in Memphis or New Orleans when you walk in.  The background music has a definite cajun and/or blues theme, which makes the eating experience complete.  All the details in the restaurant were carefully orchestrated to help you enjoy the entire eating experience.  Even the bathrooms were decorated in a very cool way.  The sink vanity is a big wine cask, with wine corks lining the sink.  The bathroom stalls are painted with chalkboard paint, and there's a small bucket of chalk on a shelf near the sink so you can leave messages for the next \"patron\".  Just a lot of fun!  Overall, I'd say George Frasher has a huge hit on his hand with Frasher's Smokehouse!  

Bravo!!"}
{"text":"The food is good. But, I noticed that they keep the food wrapped in plastic while heating. This is really bad if you are worried about BPA's. But, again it tastes good, kind of dry. They seem to be understaffed, but this could just be because people called out."}
{"text":"Just had excellent pulled pork sandwiches fries nice and crispy, good coleslaw.

Need to up the game on beer/wine, real limited and the wine pours were chintzy for a 9 dollar glass"}
{"text":"Well...came here when the place I was going to eat at was closed for renovations. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, fries and the Mac n cheese side. Went to sit down and wait for my food at a dirty table. It also had an empty roll of paper towels. I wiped the table myself with the last scrap of paper hanging on the roll and waited. Food came quickly minus the French fries as they said they were on the way. I lifted the bun and asked the girl where the BBQ sauce was after I didn't see anything on the table. She told me it was up in the front. So I walked from the back of the restaurant to the front by the entrance to a table lined up with to go boxes, plastic silverware and BBQ sauce squirt bottles. They are marked with a sharpie which flavor they contain. I filled my little plastic cups and headed back to the table. Felt very cafeteria! 

My sandwich was good and the fries once they arrived were also good. The macaroni cheese is terrible. Mushy and tastes artificial. Don't bother for 3 bucks you get a small side and it tastes bad. All food served in styrofoam, plastic and cardboard. Plastic knives and forks too!

Overall it was okay. The decor was a good attempt but the overall feel is very cafeteria which is emphasized by the lack of real plates and silverware. A long rectangular room with a bunch of booths lined up against the wall. Very dark inside due to the Edison bulbs used in the fixtures. Cool looking but not practical. 

Not sure I will come back. Meh...."}
{"text":"food was excellent and service was good. recommended BBQ if you are in the Phoenix areas"}
{"text":"Outstanding Atmosphere and BBQ!  The staff is extremely friendly and the owner (George) is always on premise. That alone shows his dedication to creating a new great restaurant for the Arizona locals. Do not pass up this place. If you dont know what to order ask the staff they will steer you in the right direction."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have eaten here. Both times were delicious. The meat was moist and I like that I get to add the bbq sauce. The Mac and cheese was delicious too. We will definitely be back. Thank you, George for another great restaurant!"}
{"text":"New location! Five stars! 
Bartender April! Five stars! 
Food ! Five stars! 
Company! A million stars! 
George, THE Frasher MAN! A million plus STARS! 
Another winner for mid town! 
Great location , great for groups! A win win! You will not be disappointed! 
Thanks for a great casual , awesome evening!"}
{"text":"Disregard the negative reviews here.  You go to this place to get barbecue and that's what these guys know and do best.  My wife and I got the baby back ribs and burnt ends (translation: the good parts of the brisket) which were amazing on their own.  Then add one of their three bbq sauces (we loved the spicy sauce, there's also Tennessee Tangy and a Sweet BBQ sauce) and it makes these meats mouth-watering.  I would go back just for the Baked Beans which are some of the tastiest beans I have had.  The corn side is grilled on the cob then sliced off -- delicious as well.  The owner, George (previously of Fraser's Steakhouse), came out to check on all the guests which was a nice touch.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying the Tri-tip and Turkey!  Thanks, guys, for satisfying our craving for BBQ!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Enjoyed the brisket and turkey. Don't pass up the flash fried spinach"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food but I am not a bbq expert. I had the chicken which was moist and flavorful and the sandwich serving was a respectable amount of meat. For $8 however, I would have expected a side to be included. My husband had the brisket which was also good but not exceptional. The fries were thick and generous but undercooked. I also tried the green chili mac which was tasty. The assortment of sauces was good too, but not exceptional.

The place was quiet at 6:30 on a friday and the service was fast.  My issues with this place started with the price point. For a smokehouse that serves on plasticware , they are a little too proud of the food. my husband and I can get full on brisket AND a cocktail apiece for the same $40 at Grassroots. 

The second issue I have is the plasticware. Plates and forks as well as styrofoam clamshells for the taking as needed, I cannot fathom the waste. Again, for the price point, please let's have silverware instead of piles and piles of plastic in our landfills. I'm sure it's cheaper than paying for a dishwasher and the staff to bus and clear, but if we went back, I would bring a fork from home."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly! The food is good, but they are always out of brisket and mashed potatoes SUPER early. The sides are also super tiny. Other than that, it's good bbq and a cool environment!"}
{"text":"Loved the steakhouse and love this spot.  Other people on here just hating. Damn yelpers... don't give a good spot bad reviews for minimal stuff like being out of takeaway menus.  It's a new restaurant and concept, going to take a little to get every little detail figured out.  If you want good barbeque, GO HERE!  I don't know of a similar spot in the area that's better.... please enlighten me if there is"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this place for lunch. The sauces are tasted good, meat is juicy. One of our favorite place for BBQ. Their service is nice, too."}
{"text":"The bbq was ok, not bad but nothing special.  The portions were small and the sides are RIDICULOUSLY over priced.  $9 for large fries??!  The way the food is brought out to the the tables is fairly inefficient... They bring out each item one at a time, wandering the restaurant like a lost child, with no idea whose food is whose calling out the names of the patrons.  You can imagine what this is like when the restaurant is busy, or when there are multiple customers with the same name."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say.  Breaded  chicken wings?  Glad they served celery and carrots.  Plastic utensils?  Either your in or your not.  if I want to eat with plastic I'll go to a food truck.   
Jenn was awesome. She made a nice drink.  Can't say I'll be back anytime soon unless babe drags me along."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited and hopeful to try this BBQ. My aunt suggested I would love it.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite hit the mark of my favorite BBQ in Phoenix. The sauces are good... they get 5 stars.  Yet the briskett was refrigerator cold on the inside, microwave tepid on the outside, tough and absent of soul and lacked flavor. The cheeseburger, tho nice in size for a kids menu, came with no fixings and lacked anything characteristic of a good bbq place. Service wise, our \"waitress\" was great and exchanged our cold briskett for the cheeseburger yet the female bartender made sure we heard, \"the briskett is cold because of the bbq sauce you put on it..\"  The bbq was room temp... her theory left a cold taste in my mouth as did.her treatment of a homeless man who came in and asked for a glass of water which she dropped the cup into his hand to make sure she didnt.touch him and didn't even apologize.  Rude.  Not the dinner experience I was expecting after a great recommendation."}
{"text":"We just Had the best Pizza ever!!! So happy that Frashers has added the first weekend of the month pizza on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I went a few months after my first review and nothing had really been changed and my pulled pork sandwich was awful. I went the day after Thomas was closed all day due to a gas leak so I thought it was possible I was eating meat that was supposed to be for the day before. But it was still too expensive for me for the plastic utensils and lack of consistency food so I won't be back."}
{"text":"Frashers has paved its own path when it comes to BBQ by presenting amazing sides to compliment it's solid meat selection!  The tryptophan coma from the smoked turkey is totally worth it!!  The gooey butter cake is a mandatory purchase and wraps up an amazing BBQ experience.  George the owner is charismatic and passionate about his craft and will totally sit down and talk BBQ and the finer details about his smoker. Thanks for the awesome experience!!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for 15 guest holiday party. Customer service was excellent on the phone - they made sure I ordered enough food and helped me choose a good variety. The food was ready on time and delicious, especially the pulled pork. Will definitely get food here again! Thank you Frasher's!"}
{"text":"Seriously, YUMMY !

The food here is AMAZING... the meats are all served plain. They don't need to drown their meat in sauce to make it taste amazing... but if youre going to use a sauce try the Tennessee sauce, perfect mix of sweet and spicy.

The sides are all great.. our favorites are the mashed potatoes and the beans, the beans eat like a chili they are so so good.

ALSO when you're there get the GOOEY BUTTER CAKE you'll thank me later. So so good"}
{"text":"This is a down home BBQ place with outstanding meats, great side dishes and a buttercake to die for!"}
{"text":"awesome place - george did great with this new place - completely different than the former frasher's steak house, but some old favorites are still on the menu (gooey buutercake, mayfair salad, garlic mashed potatoes,...)"}
{"text":"The turkey seemed like smoked deli, yes deli meat.  The corn's texture was very soft, not at all firm like fresh off the cobb. The chicken was dry and the beef was the better choice.  This is an alternative for fast food but nothing stands out."}
{"text":"What an awesome place!  This is the old Chuys location....When you enter, you are greated with awesome  aromas and friendly staff...the decor is warm and inviting....the menu is simple, a less is more approach....my daughter and I do not usually eat BBQ, but came here with our family to help my Dad celebrate his 78th birthday and he loves BBQ! We ordered a tri tip sandwich, fries,  a house salad, and their green chile mac n cheese....the portions were decent sized and the flavor of all was delicious...we even brought home leftovers :)... there were 16 people in our group and everyone enjoyed their meal tremendously!! Come and give them a try....George the owner is a very friendly guy and is doing a terrific job!  Thanks George for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic just as you might expect from George and the crew. Get ready to leave fat and happy."}
{"text":"The food was greasy not well seasoned. The signature Mayfair salad was tasteless. The prices are very inflated for lack of quality food.
Unfortunately this concept is not going fix the declining issue that was present at former Fraser."}
{"text":"An unexpected gem stumbled upon while out and about. Fresh, flavourful and friendly- we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sides were good, loved the creamy green chile mac n cheese, bbq beans were alright.  Ordered  2 meat combo.  Brisket and Tri Tip.  OMG.  About 15 degrees overcooked.  Driest meat ever, should of known when i saw King Size BBQ sauce available.  Had to drown the meat in it to get it down.  
I am from the home of the Tri Tip BBQ, Santa Maria, CA.  If this placed served me the first Tri Tip in my life it would have been the last.  That dry.  Smokehouse is misleading, I believe its a pit hickory bbq, cause smoked meat is very tender, this meat was cooked too fast and way overdone.  
Sorry Smokehouse but Im burning rubber outta here, leavin you all in my Smoke........"}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich 

It was good not great. It arrived devoid of sauce so despite it being tender and a nice portion it really needed the sauces they provide to make it tasty

So if that doesn't bother you, it ranks higher"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and Pete is the best manager ever :) It was our first time there and he walked us through the whole thing, have recommendations, really was a quality person. The music was perfect, too."}
{"text":"Had the ribs for lunch today and they were outstanding. Will be coming back very soon. I'm very picky about coleslaw, and this was exactly what I like. Owner was visible and made sure everyone was happy. Atmosphere was great for our group, we will make this a destination for us regularly."}
{"text":"This is George's newest venture since Frasher's Steakhouse. Must try the burnt ends Brisket which they smoke an additional 4 hours. I know... About time we got good barbecue in Phoenix! This restaurant will competes with Little Miss BBQ!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time to get a couple of carry-out sandwiches. I was super impressed with the helpfulness of the staff. The servings were generous and the food was excellent. This is my new \"go to\" barbecue place!"}
{"text":"Great bbq! The staff was friendly and helpful. Simple concept but very well done. Reminded me of the south. I was very impressed with the use of flavors from the meat to the beans. Must try items: pulled pork, baked beans, corn, and defiantly the mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Frasher's again and I was pleasantly surprised. This time I got the pulled pork and I now see the light about this place. The pork was delicious and the mashed potatoes and corn I ordered as sides were also great. The sweet BBQ sauce was tasty as well.

I tried the brisket again hoping it would be better this time around and still disliked it. Won't be ordering it again but I'll be back to continue trying other things."}
{"text":"Owner and servers were awesome, and food is great! Great hospitality from the owner who catered to our big group. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'll start by listing the good things. The head chef was very friendly and made sure to walk around and greet customers. I very much appreciate his effort doing this, customer service is always important. It wasn't very busy so we were able to get right in, ordered, and seated. That's unfortunately where the good ends. 

Unfortunately, the food was just mediocre and it was priced too high for the quality of food. The brisket was dry, tough and lacked the good smokey flavor that you expect at a place called a \"smokehouse\". The food cooled very quickly and dried out once it was on the plate . I had to add BBQ sauce to the brisket which is a total no-no, and makes me cry. I spent $16 and really regretted it. I'm not sure what they're process is but it seems like they cook it into \"the stall\" and then take it out of the oven. It didn't seem like they pushed it to the right internal temperature for it to come out tender. Good BBQ takes time, and this brisket tasted and felt rushed.

All in all, if you have to add BBQ sauce and use a knife to cut brisket, it's wrong. But the guy running it was friendly, so it gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ!  I like the baby back ribs, pulled pork and beans and corn.  Great for take out on the way home. Place also has a bar if you decide to go in."}
{"text":"The bomb BBQ, I have had the brisket chicken turkey and pork
Service is always friendly on the phone, The green chili mac & cheese is delicious and so is their butter cake

Get burnt ends!!!  Best brisket ever!!!!

They serve texas toast along with your meal and many different barbecue sauces

It is delicious I think you should try it!!"}
{"text":"WOW! Great BBQ in the middle of the desert!!! Sis (from Chicago) and I just returned from a wild BBQ road trip in Kansas City & St. Louis, so our expectations were low! But George and his crew have knocked it out of the park. The pulled pork was so juicy and delicious. The brisket had a great flavor, enhanced by the house-made sauces (Spicy, Tennessee Twang, & Sweet). We also tried a rib and it was fantastic. 

And the sides...heaven. The corn was amazing and the gumbo is out of this world. Friendly staff. Flavored, unsweetened teas were great also. We will definitely be back for more and when I need to get on hubby's good side, I'll bring him some of that amazing GUMBO! Thanks again for a great BBQ experience."}
{"text":"I visit Frasher's every Wednesday evening for the BarBQ and on Friday's for their fabulous Catfish Dinner.  The staff is always friendly and George never forgets a face much less a name.  Excellent Food and the sides are some of the best.  The mac n cheese, the garlic mashed and the coleslaw are some of the best.  Will keep going back.  The tradition continues from the former Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Pretty cool little barbecue place love the decor excellent service at the counter the girl their explained everything about their barbecue but what wood they used and recommended a couple things and talk me out of getting extra cornbread because they were so big now for the brisket it was the best but it was pretty good A little dry for me but very well smoked the barbecue sauce they have was pretty decent their portions for their brisket combo is huge and for what you pay was a great price jalapeno cornbread what is okay I think I was hoping for it to be better overall pretty good place I want it necessarily drive on my way for it but that was an area and definite would stop"}
{"text":"Sounds good, but sadly haven't tried it, because I have a newborn and they don't take phone orders for pick up. Who does that these days, when convenience is paramount?"}
{"text":"Stop by for brisket and it was so delish. The ambience is very inviting and calm. I love how you order your food at the front."}
{"text":"I showed up before reading the Yelp reviews, around 6 p.m. last Friday night. All BBQ sold out. I guess this is common from some of the previous posts but I just can't get to a restaurant any earlier because of work. They did have wings left so I ordered them but at $9.00 for one pound I felt they were a bit overpriced and reminded me of the ones I buy at Costco in the bag, 5 pounds for around $15.00. I ordered two sides and as mentioned by other reviewers, they were $6 each and VERY small. They say 1 cup, but seemed smaller to me and the coleslaw was not really even ONE ample portion, for $6.00 I expect more. Staff was disorganized but friendly and I really love the decor, they did a great job. I hope they work out the kinks, I am all for supporting the local family business. If they re-evaluate their side portion prices and get it together regarding the running out of their main food it could be good. I will come back in a few months and try again. I am a bit confused though, I thought this store was basically just moving from a Scottsdale location where they had been successful so wondering why all the glitches. I hope they work it out."}
{"text":"Well worth stopping for ... These guys know their cue! Don't miss the burnt ends. The beans and slaw are top notch too!"}
{"text":"Coming from KC to AZ I had high expectations. I still have yet to find a GOOD BBQ joint here in AZ. This was the last I'll try. If I Want BBQ I'll order online."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We have tried almost everything on the menu and have Not been disappointed. The staff is beyond friendly, and service is so fast. We don't live around the area but its worth the drive for sure."}
{"text":"The only thing worth ordering are the wings, which are awesome, or smoked chicken. Everything else was dry and tasteless! Follow it up with really bad service and you too can spend $50 for utter dissapointment. We live in the area and love our local places but we've gone 4 times too many now and we are done."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch because of the reviews.....
$47 later, for 2 people and we left what you see in the picture. 

ABSOLUTELY THE WORST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD!

Brisket....was that even brisket!?!! Tasted and had the texture of boiled meat.
Burnt Ends: tasteless and mushy
Baby Back Ribs: tasteless, greasy and mushy 
Turkey gumbo: full of salt
BBQ beans.....dry, tasted like the bottom of a pan
Green chili mac and cheese: a scoop of mush! 
Corn....half decent but full of butter
3 BBQ Sauces: all incredibly sweet

EVERYTHING left a greasy film in my mouth!

We should have never went in when there was only 1 other car in the parking lot.

To top this all off, as we left all of our inedible plates on the table, the waitress said absolutely nothing about all of the \"food\" we left, she actually hurried to clear the table.

Do not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Best place to eat by far. Smelled very good once you entered. Clean, well-mannered, and just tasted great! Every meat is top-notch and the mashed potatoes are the best side, next to the hush puppies. Lemonade is very different than anything I've drank, but is still the finest. Although there is only cornbread and gooey butter cake, don't get them......you'll want more! The gooey butter cake is so good. I haven't had the cornbread but, you know, cornbread is always great tasting. When I came here, they gave us a slice of gooey butter cake, for FREE! Trust me, just go here and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"As described before the opening, this is a more casual version of Frasher's Steakhouse (complete with plastic utensils and a \"place your order at the counter\" routine), but with the same steakhouse-like higher prices.. The menu is also lacking most of the favorite Midwest food items the former restaurant had (now I have nowhere but St Louis to go to eat Imo's or toasted ravs!) I ordered a small portion of average brisket and a side for around $20  I don't think I'll be returning.. Too much competition in this neighborhood to deal with minimal options, a pricey menu married with a super casual, dark environment. Giving two stars for the attentive customer service, but I can't say I prefer the food, menu or restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"We used to love Fraser's steakhouse so we have been wanting to try Fraser's Smokehouse for a long time now.  We finally stopped by today and we LOVED it.  Best baby back ribs I've had EVER!  Thank you Fraser's for finally bringing legit BBQ to AZ."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! The food is delicious and the service is even better! Everyone was so welcoming. Would definitely come back to support whenever I come back into town."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking, easy access and in a great area make this place very appealing. Frasher's is an order at the counter restaurant, which is a nice change from the traditional place. The staff is very polite and willing to answer questions which is inviting. The atmosphere is very laid back and shorts and t-shirt would not be out of place. I went with a friend and his kids, which was no problem, as they have a pretty stamdard kids menu. As for my order, I chose the pulled pork sandwich, baked beans, and I asked for cole slaw on my sandwich (If you have had pulled pork in the south, this is a must). The beans were tasty, but honestly and in my opinion, standard fare at a BBQ place- not bad at all, bud did not stand out. As for the pulled pork sandwich, it was tasty, but again (my opinion), pretty standard. One thing I noticed was that even though it was a sandwich, the bottom slice of bread was soggy. Not a problem- I just used a fork, but considering I have had truely legendary pulled pork sandwiches where the bun was not soggy, that was a tad dissapointing. The flavor was good, but again, pretty standard. Now, I am not saying this place is bad- I will go again and try something different because it seems that each BBQ place has one thing that is their specialty and I want to figure out what it is! Keep in mind that having spent years in the south, amongst some of the best BBQ masters out there, I am a hard sell to say a BBQ place is exceptional, but in my opinion, this place is good and worth trying."}
{"text":"Deeelicious!! I've been to BBQ spots before Scotssdale/Gilbert... This one, the meat stands on it's own and is enhanced by the variety of BBQ sauces. Clean, simple and generous. Nice job!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Newly opened restaurant that seems to have a lot of potential, I had the pulled pork and corn as my side. Loved both items! The owner was great, I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed and underwhelmed with quality and taste of food. Ordered the 3 meat combo with 2 sides (pork ribs, brisket, pulled pork; green Chile mac n cheese and corn). First the good: the pork ribs and brisket was decent not great. Service was fine and place was clean.

The bad:
Pulled pork was dry and tasted / looked as if sitting out for hours. Mac N cheese tasted watered down and overcooked...the cheese sauce was thin and did not taste much like cheese at all...like if you watered down velveeta 1 part cheese and 4 parts water. Yuck. Then threw a can of chiles in it. Next the corn was chewy and tasted like frozen corn that has been overcooked in a pot all day.

Overall just not great food. Rudy's is better I think...and that isn't saying a whole lot.

I wanted to like this place. The dogs will love it however. Bringing home all of the pulled pork to feed them."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Phoenix.  We tried three different proteins - all of them tasty.  The sauces are each unique and very flavorful.  The buttercake - amazing.  My mouth is watering thinking about it before breakfast this morning.  I'll be back for sure - and will bring friends."}
{"text":"This place serves up some of the best BBQ around.  Please remember there are several types of BBQ.  
This trip my father and sister came too.  
I had the chicken, beans and slaw and the food delivered again like many times before.  I might want to think about trying some of the other items on the menu.  LOL 
I think this place is a KC style BBQ.  I love the numerous BBQ places popping up all over.  It is really good.
Give this place a shot and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Totally badass BBQ, no kidding they have BBQ tofu!  WHAT!!!!! I had the ribs, Mac and cheese and paired it with their sweet sauce. Omg it's an o moment in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I give Frasher's Smokehouse 2 stars for trying, even that is being generous. The green chili mac and cheese should be called pasta salad, it was ice cold and had a sour taste to it. My husband had pulled pork that he couldn't even finish because it was so dry and the sauces were nothing to write home about. It was an all around awful experience. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Been involved in Barbecue in Midwest for over 20 years so always looking to try a new barbecue place..  Served for lunch at 11:45 and the place was about  1/2 full. First thing I noticed is everything is al-cart and way over priced for Lunch. They had no sampler platters and no combination meals so no real way to taste much. I ordered burn ends and they were out already. It's 11:45 lunch rush hasn't even started.  So I went with the brisket and baby back ribs with a side of beans. $23.00 for lunch. When they brought it to me they forgot my ribs.. Waitress said the probably gave them to someone else, so she grabbed an order from another waitress as she walked by the table. As for the sauce they had four to choose from; can only recommend the sweet.. Others are way over spiced and take way from taste of the barbecue meat. As for the meat the brisket was cooked well, good smoke ring and tender but no flavor and very little rub. Not worth the $7 for a sandwich. The beans were $3 for a half cup and was more like chili than backed beans.. If your  going to make baked beans in a BBQ joint don't put hamburger in them and make them thin. Then there was the ribs .. Oh my! They were horrible... Not done and very Fatty! No flavor. Not sure where they get their ribs but not impressed at all and being so underdone the fat didn't render out at all so it was like bitting into a cold piece of fat. 
I could not recommend this place to anyone who likes good barbecue at a fair price. Sorry I won't be back"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great customer service. We felt welcomed from the moment we walked in. Food was AMAZING as well"}
{"text":"I'd been craving smoked turkey ever since I saw that Honey Bears occasionally offered it. So when I mentioned it to my son the other night, he suggested checking out Frasher's website to see if they carried it. (I'd completely forgotten that this place had opened in the old nearby Chuy's). They did! We went over to order some takeout for Monday Night Football -- and decided to try a few things ... A rack of ribs, pound of smoked turkey, side of beans, side of chili mac-n-cheese, and some cornbread later, the family has a new go-to for our carnivorous indulgences!!! Yum! This is the real KC-style deal: dry-rub-smoked-fall-off-the-bone-melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness!!! The sauces are okay, but not really necessary. The mac was good. But, those beans!! OMG! They're a meal unto themselves. When we realized we hadn't ordered any cornbread, they threw some in for us to try. Dee-lish!! Loved the friendly staff; devoured the amazing dishes; promised we'll be back -- again and again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Baby back ribs are so good! I wish they served smoked sausages, but they only have them on Thursdays. Large tables for bigger families or large party. Try it, you'll become a believer!!"}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ I've had in my years of eating BBQ. Super laid back, friendly vibe, with wonderful service. My boyfriend and I got a 4 meat platter and two sides: ribs, chicken, brisket, and pulled pork; green chili Mac and cheese and baked beans. Oh my Lord. 
Everything was perfectly tender, no dry meat here. It was so well seasoned and cooked it didn't need sauce, but when in Rome. All of the sauces were equally as wonderful, I couldn't choose a favorite! 
We definitely will be back! I highly recommend this place to anyone with or without a love for BBQ! 
We left absolutely stuffed!"}
{"text":"If the meat here is smoked, then it certainly doesnt taste like it- with the exception of the Turkey, which is excellent. The rest of the meats that I tried (chicken, brisket and ribs) all taste like they were slow roasted in the oven.  For the ribs, they were still tender and juicy, but I missed that smoky taste. Costumer service is excellent though. Just wish the meat was better.

TRY: the Turkey and the green chili mac and cheese
AVOID: Cornbread (dry), brisket (tough and flavorless)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!! We had the best experience in a long time when trying a new place. The meats rocked and the corn bread was the best ever. We will be back."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix for conference duties, had to stop by a local bbq joint.  Service was excellent.  The person taking our order definitely recommended the ribs.  We got a mix of 3 meats, ribs, brisket and tri tip along with a pulled pork sandwich.  While waiting for  our order the guy who took our order delivered my peach margarita after a small wait.  He came back later with our order to go along with a coupon for some credit.  He apologized that it took a while for him to get my drink.  Was definitely impressed but had to decline because I said I'm from California and wasn't too sure when I would be back.  So he hooked it up with some dessert instead.  I'm about to dig into my food but the meats smell delicious!   I'm taken not only for the great food but excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"I got the baby back ribs with jalapeño Mac n cheese and corn!! SOOO good I had this for my cheat meal and will definitely be back... (put bbq sauce on the bread and make a Mac n cheese sandwich!!!!) BEST THING EVER"}
{"text":"Right up there with the top turkey in town, but the real star of the show was the green chile mac n cheese. This was a more soupy version of the dish, but once you mixed up the mac, the flavors really shone through and no liquid was left after you finished. I looked forward to each bite of this side dish and it went great with the turkey. Now this turkey was sliced really thick, some people like it thinner, but it tasted great and they don't skimp on the portions. It was about $11 for lunch, but very worthy. The sauce was a tossup as both the TN tang and sweet stuff hit different notes. Owner was wandering around cleaning tables and seems like a nice guy from the midwest (who isn't?). Probably head back to try the Monday pastrami special."}
{"text":"Glad I stopped. Nice restaurant  family owned and it shows! Wonderful service for take out pulled pork sandwich!  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Ribs were good, the brisket and tri-tip were a bit dry.  Sausage wasn't bad.  From a local vendor.  Turkey had some nice flavor.  Flash fried spinach was interesting.  Nice texture, but needed some salt or additional seasoning. Cole slaw was tasty.

Nice ambiance inside."}
{"text":"This was our first stop here after meaning to come for a while. It was hit and miss. Pretty classic BBQ joint environment. The server was super friendly and helpful. We tried several items. The gooey butter cake dessert was definitely the highlight! The ribs were also delicious. The pulled pork was very good. The tri-tip was ok. The brisket was not very good, no smoke ring and a lot tougher than I would anticipate. The sides were mostly ok. Mashed potatoes were the best. The corn was so-so. The mac and cheese was tasty but could've use a little more spice. The sauces were all ok as well. Overall, I'm not mad about it but we won't be hurrying back."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood!  Stopped in this evening to try out the menu. The parking lot is filled with the fantastic smells of the outdoor smoker. The inside is clean but perfectly set as a BBQ joint. The staff was all very nice and offered a great overview of the offerings. 

Daughter had the ribs, and is now addicted.  I tried the Gumbo, and can honestly say that it is one of the best gumbos I have had, ever. I have traveled a bit and had my share, but this one is off the chart. Lastly, I had the two entree combo, with brisket and pulled pork. Epic. 

Well done Frasher. Welcome to the 'hood."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I am a BBQ snob, I found the ribs moist and generous in the portion given.  The beans were meaty and delicious. I was in and out in 10 minutes for takeout.  Everyone was nice.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We eat at a lot of Bar B Q joints, and this one is the worst we have experienced, really!
The servings were small, the side of beans and mac & cheese were extra small. You would think that for $30.00 ( our bill without drinks), we would have received ample servings, and large sides.The pulled pork was piled in a little pile and contained  many sorts of gristly black threads of something. The brisket was hard, chewy, and dry. The four tiny slices of bread were skimpy and ridiculous as well. So we received about $6.00 worth of food for $30.00....."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing St. Louis BBQ. Gooey Butter Cake is the best too. Big portions too! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food/awesome staff.Everyone is very attentive and friendly.
You have to try the smoked turkey and the Gumbo ...they were both Awesome!!!!

Great Food/Staff and ambiance.
Great work!
Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Absolutely love George! The food is out of this world and it has a very friendly & inviting vibe. Pulled Pork is delicious along with various other things on the menu. The one thing they are still famous for is the \"gooey cake!\" It is a MUST have/try the first time you go! So make sure you save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best BBQ around! The turkey is amazing and the ribs are to die for. When I get a craving for good brisket, this is where I go."}
{"text":"Tri-tip sandwich for lunch was great! The staff was very helpful in helping you decide what you would like to order. Would definitely recommend ."}
{"text":"Good food, appropriate prices, comfortable servings. I enjoyed sitting outside enjoying the soft winter's day."}
{"text":"Love this place the people the food.  I have never had a bad meal or time at this place. I wish the Bar was bigger but you will enjoy the food 


Peace in the Middle East"}
{"text":"Found this establishment on Yelp, I was visiting Phoenix.  It was good, prices were about the usual for a bbq restaurant. I got the 3 meat plate, come w 2 sides and Texas Toast.  Went around 2-3p on a Monday, there was no crowd. THE EMPLOYEES WERE VERY NICE and the place is clean.  A MUST TRY IS THE GOOEY BUTTER CAKE, OMG  FANTASTIC!! I will def visit/eat here again!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed.  I love brisket but this is the first time I had brisket from a smoke house that lacked the smoke flavor.  The brisket was moist as I asked for fatty brisket.  The cashier was friendly.  She gave us a sample of the turkey and pull pork but it was really dry.  We ended up with the brisket platter with two sides and the baby back ribs with two sides.  We ordered the garlic mashed potatoes, green chili Mac n cheese, baked beans and corn.  The sides were okay.  The baby back ribs had a little smoke flavor, the meat was moist and did fell off the bones."}
{"text":"I've been to Frashers twice now.
On my first visit I ordered the burnt ends. They were extremely flavorful, smokey and fatty but an order consisting entirely of burnt ends is a bit overpowering.the green chili Mac and cheese was solid though. On my second visit burnt ends weren't ready yet; however Brisket was. Hrmmm don't you cut the burnt ends off first?? I ordered the Brisket and found it had zero bark as they say they cut it off to make the burnt ends. The Brisket was extremely rubbery, and given that burnt ends weren't available at opening time I highly suspect I was either eating yesterday's Brisket or they don't know how to properly smoke a Brisket. Given the high prices, and the poor meat cook I can't recommend this place. Hopefully they can improve because I really wanted to like the place."}
{"text":"Nothing but warm, deliciousness on my tastebuds and in my tummy.  Gotta give it to George & his crew.  Top notch food and fantastic, pleasant customer service.  Thank you for always being on point."}
{"text":"Well, I don't know about 5/5 as compared to some other places I've been, but I'll say 4.5/5.  I finally cleaned the 4000 restaurant receipts out of my purse so I'd remember to write reviews, and got to Frasher's.  My husband and I were here back in late July and came prepared to take leftovers home because we wanted to try a lot of food.  Here is what we ordered:

3 meat plate ($17) which comes with 2 sides.  We ordered the fries and baked beans.  We also ordered a side of green chile mac & cheese, some cornbread, and a half doz of the smoked wings, naked.  For our meats we tried the brisket, chicken, and baby back ribs.

Everything was 5/5 except for the chicken.  It was pretty dry and I probably would not order that again.  Do I really need to go into details?  Just look at the pictures.  The baked beans were seasoned very nicely and had chunks of smoked meat in them.  Very nice to dip that dry chicken in.  The baby backs were our favorite out of the 3 meats and we didn't have any of those leftover to take home, I can assure you.  The wings had a nice smoky flavor and were surprisingly moist, but the drummies had a fair amount of gristle.  Just kind of a turnoff to what would otherwise be perfect wings.  

The cornbread.  Dude, the cornbread.  It's listed separately under desserts and if you order it you will see why.  Totally decadent and we had a couple of bites and took the rest home.  I proceeded to savor the rest all by myself the next day.  Delicious.  

And how could I forget the green chile mac & cheese?  Fantastic!  We had a great meal and took 2 togo containers home with us as well.  All that food and a beer came out to $37.47.  Not bad at all.  The staff were friendly and helpful as well, when we told them it was our first visit.  Is it the best BBQ I've ever had?   No, but it's in my top 10.  Looking forward to going back and getting a full order of those ribs, some cornbread, and some mac & cheese.  I don't know what you'll be having, but that's my dinner!"}
{"text":"Sauces were great and markedly different from each other. I love the easy access and the readily available to-go containers.
The turkey and chicken were moist and flavorful.
The beef was not as flavorful or tender.
For sides I thought contrary to the potato bashing made be other YELPERS, I liked the consistency of their mash."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here .. Ribs  are fantastic  ...Pulled Pork  comes in a close 2nd ... Don't miss the \"gooey butter cake \" it's like crack !! Make sure to say hi to the owner George , he will always take care of you and make things right !!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while. Finally ate there....I can check it off my list. The meat was moist and seasoned well. But still nothing to write home about. The macaroni chili was mediocre and bland. Over priced for quality. And no peach cobbler?! WTH?!!!! What place has ribs and meal and no cobbler? Bizzair. They have some sad \"original butter cake\"= nothing impressive. Bummed because I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"We loved Frasher's Steakhouse and were sorry to see it go after so many years.  But we have been to the new Frasher's several times now and found the food to be just as good as at the original Frasher's.  All the meat is incredibly flavorful and tender.  The atmosphere is casual but comfortable.  1st class barbecue!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in town. Great atmosphere, awesome food and great service!!! :0)"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ! Best since I've had since Texas. Brisket is top notch, ribs are even better. Great service!"}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue in town. Not only is the food excellent, the service is best of the best.  Favorite menu items are the chicken, ribs, Mac n cheese and cream corn.  I have also used Frasher's several time for company events and meetings and they always have everything ready to go right back on time. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place! I pulled up and although it looked deserted , I decided to park my car and try my luck, boy am I glad I did. I was approached by a incredibly nice girl upfront, very welcoming! I asked about the baby back ribs and she said with confidence those are what everybody likes ( don't quote me word for word) well she wasn't kidding!  She was so cute although they take the order at the front when you come in and then bring the food when cooked, I  still gave her a $6.00 tip . When  she gave me change from my 20.00 bill ( Oh yes did I tell you my meal was only 13.00 and change!!!) I said keep the change and she was so honest as to say wait this is 6.00 (when someone can put a mile on your face like she did with impeccable customer service, she deserves a big tip!!!Ok now to the ribs!!!The rib meat fell off the bone and into my mouth! The coleslaw which they make with a vinegar dressing instead of mayo was fabulous!! I can't say enough about this place!! Kudos to the owner who obliviously mentors his employees with his heart oh yes and don't leave without trying desert!!! Oh my goodness please excuse my punctuation as I was not able to gather my bearings an incredible establishment that just fell into my lap!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food, service,  sauces (the tangy one is my favorite) and prices. Hands down the best BBQ in Phoenix. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was really shocked at the quality of the meats for such little money! Good size portions and selections makes this an affordable place to visit.Will be returning again in the future. Can't forget about the crew awesome in every way!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST gumbo & corn bread I have EVER had!!!
I have been craving it all week!!! I can't wait to try the \"burnt ends\" next time. Oh- the smoked turkey was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Great place! Great smokehouse! No frills, clean not pretentious just plain good BBQ. Multiple sauces, full bar great place"}
{"text":"When I want sit-down BBQ that is served fast, needs paper towels, has plenty of sauces, and in a Cowboy-esque atmosphere, I go to Frasher's. Being within the Arcadia area is a big plus. I like the flat screens playing sports, free self-serve soft drink refills, and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Mehhh! Was totally disappointed. First off, the service was sad. I asked about the size of their chicken wings..the guy taking my order said \"the size of chicken wings\"- I'll pass on the side of smart a$$ thanks. Just a bad attitude. 
But, on to the food. My mouth was sexy for some good ole BBQ!! I ended up giving my dry chicken and fries to the homeless lady outside..along with their soupy/kraft macaroni mac-n-cheese. But, the cornbread was decent.
Mehh! Won't go back."}
{"text":"Meh, food was just ok. Brisket was flavorful but not very tender or moist  Chicken and ribs were average.  Service was freindly and fast."}
{"text":"I took the Wife out for a Sunday night dinner and was amazed at the quality of the food. The Ribs were awesome. No sauce was needed since they had so much great flavor and we couldn't get enough of them. The owner George was walking around making sure everything was up to par and which it was. Its a Great environment for dining. Definitely recommend. Thanks for the great food and service keep it up."}
{"text":"I could not be happier about finding this place. The food is amazing, the customer service is well above the industry standard, and the prices are reasonable. I love the ribs, but just tried the Burnt ends. My life is now complete! So delicious. I can't wait to come back for some more real BBQ. Side note - the gooey butter cake is a must for desert!!!!"}
{"text":"We came in at an off hour completely expecting to be served older bbq & were taken aback by the delicious fresh smokey aroma! We were greeted right away by who I'm assuming is the GM or owner, he was great & went over the menu with us. You could tell how enthusiastic he was about the BBQ, he offered to get us samples of anything on the menu & gave us complimentary soft drink cups as it was our first time. I had the 3 meat combo with ribs/turkey/brisket and garlic mash and green chili Mac as the sides. The ribs were my least favorite (still good) but I prefer my ribs with more of a bite to them, these were a little too tender. The brisket was flavorful & juicy, turkey was the winner as it had the delicious smokey flavor while still being tender. I didn't care for the sides, the garlic mash was good but it just didn't seem to pair well with the smokey meats. The Mac was a little soggy but my husband enjoyed it. We will definitely be back as the food was wonderful, priced well for BBQ and the service was top notch!"}
{"text":"Great casual place with very nice staff & very juicy & tender meats!!! Mac & cheese awesome!!"}
{"text":"George Frasher started something so good that I couldn't think about eating anywhere else in the area. George himself, a St. Louis native like myself, understands the concept of great BBQ and delivers 100%. This food is just as great as the staff that presents and makes the food. This is the only place in the valley that reminds me of authentic Midwest BBQ, not to mention the perfect touch of Gooey Butter Cake and Imos Pizza to top it off. I highly recommend this delicious restaurant."}
{"text":"My family was looking for a good BBQ place and Frasher's did not disappoint. We went for lunch and found the place surprisingly empty. The place was clean and the service was fast and friendly. The prices were fair and the portions generous. Even the bathrooms were nice. The food itself wasn't the best meat I've ever had, but it was still some good quality BBQ. They have their three BBQ sauces out for easy access, so you can decide how much you want of each. All three were pretty good and worth trying.

Overall, I'm not going to say this is the best BBQ joint in the valley, but I will say it's worth a try. You want good BBQ without the long lines and less than ideal seating options? Try this place out!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place! George Frasher wants to help put Phoenix on the map as a BBQ mecca. 

The meats are served plain and you can choose amongst three different types of sauces. This makes the 
BBQ experience more personalized and less messy! 

I had chicken and my friend had ribs. Don't expect fall off the bone...George says that's a sign they're overcooked! 

Mac and cheese was tasty as was the cole slaw. Oooey Gooey Butter Cake (George's mom's recipe) is like the top part of a frosted bundt cake. And Moscow Mule was great and came in a copper mug which many restaurants don't have! 

Worth noting: they fry their spinach so it's like crispy spinach chips - delish!

When you say BBQ that can mean a lot of different styles, so check out the maps and look at all the different regional variations. 

Highly recommended!

I heard George Frasher speak at the AZ Central Food and Wine Experience. I thought his sincerity and pure love of cooking and BBQ was very endearing. I had also tasted the food at the event so I KNEW it would be good!"}
{"text":"We've been to Frasher's a number of times for their barbeque meats and always loved them all -- brisket and smoked turkey are my personal favorites.
Last night we were able to (finally!) take advantage of their \"first Friday of the month\" St. Louis style pizza.  The Frasher's have family roots in St. Louis and offer pizza and toasted ravioli from their family recipes.
What exactly IS St. Louis style pizza?  Thin, cracker crust, with a unique local cheese (dare I say, addictive?), and cut into squares vs. wedges.  
We got the 16 in. pie with sausage and the toasted ravioli with homemade tomato sauce.  Both were EXCELLENT!  Hot, crispy. The ravioli were stuffed with hamburger.  We took ours home and re-heated the pizza at our leisure -- because it is so thin, it crisps up in a hot oven in 3-4 minutes.  Delicious.
And -- the staff at Frashers told us that now we don't have to wait a whole month before our next pizza fix ... Starting in mid-March, the St. Louis pizza will become a regular item on Frasher's menu.  Good news for all you pizza lovers out there."}
{"text":"Great barbecue. The turkey platter was excellent. My wife is a vegetarian. She ordered four sides & loved all of them. George Frasher is an excellent host. Oh, & try the gooey butter cake. I usually don't eat desserts; I devoured it. Great decor."}
{"text":"Good BBQ but not great. In the sea of mediocre BBQ places this fits right in. I love good BBQ but I dont think I would bother going back to eat here on my own. 2.5 is the best score I could give this place."}
{"text":"The owner George is an incredible host, but the food is the star. I eat here a couple times a week and everything is excellent. My favorite dish is the catfish with their unique flash fried spinach."}
{"text":"Amazing! Worth checking out, all the meats are fantastic and perfectly cooked. A great dinner spot for flavorful meats. I love the chicken with the spicy BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I have sat at the Vegan restaurant across the street from Frasher's, looking out the window; and hearing the BBQ sirens calling out my name!

\"Why eat vegetables, when you can feast on delicious Smoked BBQ Flavored meat!\" The sirens incessantly called out.

I'm not a practicing vegan, but I do enjoy a well prepared Vegan Meal. However, I have no compunction of consuming meat, as well. 

I had managed to resist all that time, until one day, my daughter invited us to dinner. 
When I suggested to her that we go to the Vegan restaurant, she proffered the alternative across the street - Frasher's!

That's all the urging that I needed. Whatever reservations I had about eating at this place didn't just go out the window. It was literally heaved out the window!

As we walked in, the aroma of such delicious BBQ flavored meats wafting from the kitchen and enveloping the place was simply too much to stand. It didn't help at all that I hadn't eaten dinner from the previous evening. And then I summarily skipped breakfast and lunch, as well.

My beloved wife and daughter wanted to examine the menu; whereas I knew exactly what I wanted. 

I had the 2 meat combo (Pulled Pork and Brisket) with all the trimmings (Baked Beans, Fries, Corn Bread, and Garlic Mashed Potatoes). I realize that the meal comes with two sides, but that would not suffice this evening.

Honestly, I forgot what my family ordered, until I looked at the pictures of their food choices, as I write this review. I was absolutely fixated on how my order was going to turn out, and the subsequent enjoyment that I would derive from it.

So, much for loving husband and father! LOL

I digress. 

They had the pulled pork and the brisket, individually; with all the trimmings.
Our overall impressions were that each of our dinner selections were a definite home run!

The meats were well prepared, seasoned, and had the proper textures. Not too soggy, and not too dry. The staff were both cheerful, and enthusiastic. Definitely quite passionate about their product, and truly interested and concerned about each customer's impression; as we had observed during our time there.

The sirens that beckoned us to this place positively and absolutely did not lead to a shipwreck. On the contrary, they led us to a wonderful dining establishment that we so truly enjoyed!"}
{"text":"My first visit was the other day for lunch and I was so happy with it I bought some for dinner and enjoyed it. However yesterday and pick some up in the evening to bring home for dinner and the brisket was way overcooked. It was gray and dry and tough."}
{"text":"Best bbq I've had since I lived in Kansas City! The Turkey is the TRUTH! Good sides as well.  They keep it simple and the focus is definitely on the food."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, very friendly and informative. 
The brisket didn't melt in my mouth. Meat was so so . 
Mac and cheese and gooey butter cake very yummy"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new BBQ joints in Phoenix, the most tender brisket and their Texas toast was unfair, it's otherwise what you expect from a smokehouse, although more BBQ chop house I'd say, in any case they have a few sauces to your liking, mine was the spicy. Going back soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Frasher's Smokehouse on a wim.  The inside smelled great, of smoked bar b qued meat.  My wife's pulled pork sandwich and my beef brisket was great.   The owner stopped by to make sure everything was great.  If we lived near Phoenix, we would be there alot.  Next time we come to Phoenix, will eat there again."}
{"text":"Out with the old and in with the new!
Stopped in today with my brother to try some of the grub I have been hearing about for the past few weeks. It really was all that and more!!! I generally don't trust most restaurants with Cole Slaw, but I have always trusted George and his kitchen and I have to say The Slaw is OUTSTANDING!!! what was even more perfect was the Brisket sliced just the way I like it and the star of it all was The smoked Turkey Breast. My bro tried the mac and cheese and said it was as good as the Original spot. No fried Raviolis or late night drinking here, but I actually like this spot better then the old digs on Scottsdale rd. 
Service couldn't have been any better from the nicest lady, and it was great to cross paths and palms again with George.  Stop in cause these guys have cued up some mighty fine BBQ."}
{"text":"Great smoked turkey beans and coleslaw. 
Friendly and attentive staff, great music. 
The sauces were good as well.

Next time i eat here, they can keep the Wonder bread in the plastic bag, to me, it doesn't belong on the plate with such tasty meat. -1 star for having that in the building.

Forget Dickies this is the place to have a great bbq experience.  I will be coming back here for other flavors."}
{"text":"Just moved close by and I liked this place a lot. Pulled pork was my favorite, and turkey was delicious. It was moist, with lots of flavor. I thought the mashed potatoes were tasty and the baked beans were pretty good. The only thing was the ribs were a bit dry, It could have just been a bad batch. I'm excited to go back and try the green chili mac n cheese. 

The service was great, the whole menu was explained to us very quickly and we were given great recommendations. They also have one of my favorite beers, Fat Tire. Give it a try if you're nearby."}
{"text":"I dig the food. Worst part is they run out of the good stuff on the regular. Never stayed to eat either.  Just takeout."}
{"text":"I was a fan of their Prime Rib, which is not yet available at this new venue.

Pleasant enough surrounding for BBQ with ordering from a knowledgeable young girl and delivery to your table.  The owner does circulate, which is a nice touch.

Based on previous Reviews I tried the \"Burnt Ends\" and they had good (NOT excellent) flavor. I thought the portion was small and their \"sides\" are ridiculously small and priced much too high, which seems to be the \"norm\" for BBQ Restaurants. All in all NOT a bargain and for the price would expect significantly better. 

All in all will NOT try again, unless he starts serving the same Prime Rib he did at his long standing location on Scottsdale Road."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place is amazing! I wish I took some pictures of the food to post but I was too busy stuffing my face with all of the deliciousness! My wife and I are in Phoenix visiting for a few days and we found this place because she was craving ribs and it was the closest BBQ place to our Airbnb. Right from the moment we walked in the place we were greeted with friendly staff and smiling faces :) Every single person there was so kind and funny and made us feel at home. I had the chicken sandwich with green chili Mac and cheese and a side of fries and cornbread and my wife had the ribs with mashed potatoes and beans and everything was cooked to perfection! We live in San Diego so sadly we can't come here often but we'll make it a point to always stop by when we're in town for the good food and the great people that work here!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try George's newest concept. That area needs a BBQ place, and this one is great! I bought the 1/4 pulled pork, which comes as a sandwich, and French fries. Delicious!  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went there for my first time with my roommate and a buddy with his girlfriend.  When I got my ribs, I was expecting them to near fall off the bone, however, they did not.  I usually go to Outback as I like the soften of their meat and the ease at which it comes off the bone. 

Now, there are others who really like their ribs, but for me, it just wasn't what I was expecting, so if you are expecting an outback type ribs, you will be disappointed.  But again, this is only my opinion and you may just love them like many others do!  The sauce is really good, I can say at least.  

But this is what sets this restaurant apart from many others, and that is how they handle an unhappy customer.  The owner took the ribs off my bill, offered me something else, then brought me a complimentary side of chili/beans which were very good.  And then he brought out table a dessert to share for free.  To me, that would make me come back to try their pulled pork, which my roommate enjoyed.  

It's rare these days where you find owners really appreciative of the patrons business, and that's something that I fully value as a customer."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome bbq. Great Mac n cheese. They had a killer desert also called gooey butter cake."}
{"text":"Long have I searched for a BBQ spot that could satisfy my cravings. This may be it. The meat is amazing, tasty sides and good service.

When you walk in, you have to go to the counter to order and pay, then they'll bring it to you. Or you can always sit at the bar. We went at dinner time and it wasn't too busy. We both got ribs and then the hot mac and cheese, beans, and cornbread.

The ribs come unsauced, but are sooo delicious and not super fatty or anything. The sauces that they have are sweet, Tennessee tang, and hot. The best is the sweet but I wish they had some better sauces. 

The spicy mac and cheese was cheese my and jalapeñoy deliciousness. Super ooey gooey and very filling. 

The baked beans have meat in them and are kind of like a chilli with a whole lot of flavor! They could be a meal all on their own.

The cornbread is fine, but I wished it had been sweeter, it was a little dry for my taste."}
{"text":"Went last night for ribs. 1lb of baby back ribs ($24) & 2 medium sides ($12) & 2 medium iced tea...total $44 
Not too thrilled with this place. First of all, the ribs are just pork ribs & not baby backs. However they did taste pretty good. The sides are mediocre. The decor is like a self service  joint. Line up to order, pick your table & they will bring the food. Not much table service. My complaints are that it costs way too much for $44 for a rib dinner which doesn't even include sides. I'll have better value & services at other restaurants ( ie Lucille's BBQ ). Probably won't go back again ! Disappointed !"}
{"text":"Solid experience and hoping that a future visit brings another star.  Brisket was too dry with little char or fat to keep it tender.  That was the big complaint and hopefully I caught it on a bad day.  The ribs and sides were great. A nod to the items prepared in the St. Louis style."}
{"text":"I lived part of my life in Oakland, and so I know good barbecue. Hey, Everett & jones! When I first walked into Frashers, I was a bit cautious: everyone (from the staff to the clientele) is white!  Just like you can gauge the authenticity of a Chinese restaurant by how many Chinese people dine there, I feel more reassured with bbq when I see African Americans doing the cooking and eating. But the bbq here is Legit. I ordered both the burnt ends sandwich and the baby back ribs, and the staff assured me it would be enough for a good meal.  The burnt ends I wasn't crazy about: more of a novelty item, an acquired taste. A bit tuff and chewy. 
      But the back back ribs. OH. my. God. The baby back ribs is Hella good. The bbq sauces, which u serve urself, is On Point. What I noticed as a good touch is that Frashers toast their bread on the griddle. Everett & jones just serve wonderbread in a sandwich bag. It's a very nice touch, a solid finish on the execution.  And toss in how friendly and nice the staff is, and the very reasonable prices, and Frasher is A WINNER."}
{"text":"NO!  DONT DO IT. I don't want to write a negative review. I've been there twice now and it angers me. Especially considering what I got for how much I paid. 

-brisket is like POT ROAST w BBQ sauce. It tastes like it's cooked in an oven and not smoked or even grilled. 
-no flavor
-no smoke ring
-greasy
-flavorless

Ribs and sides are decent. All of the flavor is in the sauce, but the meat is just bad.  

Don't believe me, check out the smoke when you show up...oh wait there is none. They do have a side smoker but it looks like something I should have in my backyard. Not a restaurant. 

Also, very pricey for what you get. My thoughts. Save your money or if you really need a fix try Little Miss. 

Frasher's sorry for the review but please take this as advice as I want to see you succeed. Get some smoke and flavor on that meat. And work on your take out presentation. Fatty brisket floating in grease in a styrofoam box is not appealing."}
{"text":"Went last Friday for my dad's birthday, had a good time.  They only had 3 meats left on the menu for the day so I was disappointed we missed out on the burnt ends.  But the other meats we got were pretty good.  The set up is okay but they don't need to let you know you need to order drinks as well as alcohol when you order your food.  Also when they bring your food they should tell you, you need to get your own utensils.  Price is okay, hopefully as they are opened longer and if they listen to their reviewers it will only get better.  I think they set their own bars high by handing up all their rewards from Frasher's Steakhouse.  Good Luck guys I'll be back."}
{"text":"Looking forward to trying it again in about a month. Hoping they can make some changes before I go back. 

When we got there (about 6:45pm) they had run out of bbq, except for chicken. So I had me some chicken. I give the chicken 5 stars; it was absolutely delicious, and priced fairly (1/2 lb for $8. So, they have at least one main dish right. The rest of my experience was lack-luster. Here's what went wrong: 


ISSUES:
~ staff unorganized. This is not the fault of the staff; this is a management issue. Why open a place if it's not organized?
~ they ran out of bbq! I know it's cheaper to run out than it is to make a little extra, but it isn't very nice for the customer to only have one option
~ side dishes were good (green chili mac-n-cheese, and coleslaw), but severely overpriced. Those two sides cost us $6 and the portions were really small. Suggestion: if you are going to have small side dishes, just include it with the main course instead of jabbing everyone for every morsel on their plate.
~the bar didn't have basic liquors; just knock off brands. Also, what's a bbq place without beer on tap?
~ when we placed our order at the counter the process was not organized. 
~ pet peeve: hate it when I stand in line to order and the receipt I am supposed to sign has a line for a tip. I like to have my food served before I issue a tip. Isn't the reward supposed to come after the service? 

I'm going to give this place another go in a month or so. If they can make a few corrections it could go from below average to great. In my opinion there's a-lot of work needed to achieve that goal. I want it to work. We need a great bbq place in these parts. Need a lesson on how? Go have a meal at Little Miss BBQ in South Phoenix. People stand in line there for the privilege of having great BBQ because it's that darned good."}
{"text":"Holy COW! This place is amazing! 

Had to try this spot since its new in the neighborhood and I love bbq. Food was excellent, service is super friendly and the ambiance is casual- perfect for dinner out with my Fam which includes my rambunctious 2 year old.  I'm a huge bbq sauce fan so it's great that you can grab a bottle of your choosing and have as much as you like. 

Surprise free dessert at the end- best Ooey Gooey Carmel Cake- yum!

Will be back again and again"}
{"text":"If you want the best baby back ribs...come here!, the best green chili macncheese, come here! The best pulled pork,  come here!
George out does himself on his molasses sauce!
The best! A forever returning fan...most definitely!"}
{"text":"Their pulled pork is one of the best I have had in the area. The service is nice 100% of the time and it creates a nice neighborhood feel. Will definitely continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Very underwhelmed, the brisket and chicken combo was dry and skimpy on both brisket and chicken. $28.00 for 2 ok, but really, you should ever leave hungry. A big disappointment."}
{"text":"This was an unplanned excursion on the way to grab a burger somewhere else.  The building caught my eye and decided to stop. boy am I glad I did.  The outside has a big patio and the interior is spacious and nicely decorated.The bathrooms were clean and there is even a Frank Zappa Poster hanging up in the hallway. 

 Travis and the bartender took fantastic care or us.Everyone was warm and friendly including the cooks waiving from the back.  it looks like they are more than happy to work there.  I have been all over the country and had many different BBQ and this one of the best.  Whats nice is they provide you with sauce on the side in squeezable bottle letting you choose.  I love this.  This way it allows you to taste the smoked  flavor of the meat. I tried the Brisket, pulled pork and the burnt end.  All outstanding, I am always partial to pulled port.  The sauces they had I tried and really likes the hot one.  just enough spice for my pallet. My sides were the Baked Beans,the coleslaw Garlic Mashed and the Green Chile Mac n Cheese.  Loved them all  really the black beans could be a meal on their own, the mashed melts in your mouth and the mac has just enough chili to let you know its there. The slaw was just the way I like it non goo  not runny just refreshing and thick. I have to try the Gooey Butter cake.  I was like its made of what.... Well it was outstanding a real treat.  I don't eat desert ever but this was very special and different so give it a rip.  

 I wish these folks well. The staff speaks highly about the owner and the care he put into his recipes.  The whole place runs like a top notch restaurant very pleased I will be back, with friends and family."}
{"text":"I always order the ribs and baked beans. Fantastic! The best beans I've ever had and the ribs are a top contender against the now retired Rib Pit in DC. Yum!"}
{"text":"It's alright. The butter cake was the best part! Other then that the sauce is alright not much flavor and the meat is dry. The food is not horrible but not amazing."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ I've had in Phoenix - and I've been searching for awhile! Excellent food, atmosphere and most importantly, service. All staff members are friendly and attentive. The owner, George, was kind enough to introduce himself today and as always, ask if we require anything. Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. The place is scented with smokey bbq. The deserts are to die for. You will be in heaven. Staff is super friendly and accommodating. Outdoor patio is spacious. The decor is cozy and western.It's a lovely place, that's all there is to it."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night for the first time. I must say I was impressed. The ribs were fantastic. They were served with out sauce so you can add your own. I found them perfect as they were served.I also tried the green chili mac n cheese. That was so good. I wish the bread would have been a little more toasted but it was good. The service was quick and with a smile. Going to have to come back and try some of the other item on the menu."}
{"text":"The pulled pork is amazing. I really enjoyed the selection of sauces. The green chili mac and cheese and the coleslaw were amazing additions to the meal. The place was great!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday brunch time. Definitely not busy cuz they just opened about 30 minutes ago. Parking lot is good. nice family / cozy/ Mississippi feeling atmosphere on the inside.
Good music. Good ambience.

Order a brisket sandwich with one side of corn and also a half pound of baby back ribs with 2 sides. For the two sides I had the potato and mac and cheese.

With regards to the size, and the corn was okay. I would pass on the mashed potato. Mac and cheese would be a better choice for a side.

With regards to the brisket, still juicy, not dried, flavor really depends on the sauce that they have on the side for you to get on your own.

With regards to the ribs, definitely way more meat than other places, juicy, some fatty parts, flavor also depends on the sauce as well, but eating it by itself is still good.

With regards to the sauce, I preferred the Tennessee sauce. The spicy BBQ sauce isn't really that spicy, but would be my second go to Sauce. The sweet sauce was very Bland and lacked flavor. I did not try the tangy sauce which was the last sauce there.

Overall, Tennessee sauce is my favorite.

Also with the rib plate you get 2 side of Toast. 

Pricing wasn't too bad.
The brisket sandwich cost around $10 I believe. Plus tax.
$14 plus tax for the rib plate, half pound ribs.

Quick-service especially if you go when I did in the morning right after they open.

They also have daily specials, such as pastrami Mondays, Texas Tuesday, check the calendar on the outside for the daily specials."}
{"text":"First: go try it. 
Second: baby backs

Beer selection was in a bottle mostly, a few on tap.  I did love the food, the desert is to die for.  The corn bread is awesome.  He uses multiple areas for his inspirations:  Memphis, Texas, Kansas City type bbq.  He was all out of the mustard BBQ, which I so wanted to try because of my many military travels, the South Carolina Mustard BBQ is one of my favorites, especially on Wings.......

This is a great establishment, great prices, and he has been a local restauranteur for several decades.  

My only suggestion to George.  Please get with local breweries and place those taps on the bar.  We have some amazing local brews.

R"}
{"text":"Disregard the negative reviews, above. There's nothing to dislike, here. Good bark on the meaty baby backs. I ordered the two-pound plate with 10 bones with the sole intent of having some bones to take home for tomorrow night's supper. 

Other stellar servings and moments:
-- Friendly, courteous staff members. And when you tell them thank you they don't say \"No problem.\"  Instead the proper \"You're welcome.\" or its equivalent.
-- The veggies served with the wings were killer. Fresh. Crisp.  Crunchy. And cold as ice. I ordered extra carrots; I couldn't stop eating them. 
-- The Ranch dressing served with the wings was better than any I've ever tasted. Honest to Pete. Creamy. Perfectly seasoned. Damn near drinkable!
-- Green Chili Mac was killer diller.
-- Baked beans were near chili-like. A bowl of 'em and a  slip of Saltines would be good on a cold, Winter night. 
-- The Texas toast was delicious and buttery.  Toasted on the griddle jus' like this Texas boy is used to.  The bread had the same \"tooth\" as potato bread, however the bread's packaging referenced not a spud. I could've eaten a whole loaf but I didn't wanna push my luck having ordered extra carrots.  
-- House music is good ol' blues and mellow rock at precisely the right volume.  If I wasn't driving I'd dive into one of the bar's bottles of tequila. 
-- George, the owner, is a cutiepatootie Teddy bear. 

Now, if the joint added apricot fried pies to the dessert menu, thus ol' Texas boy would be forever grateful. Otherwise, the joint's a winner.

Check it out or miss out."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this BBQ restaurant.  The staff is friendly and the pulled pork is to die for.  Try all three sauce blends, they all rock."}
{"text":"I drove past Fraser Smokehouse on my way to CrossFit Saturday morning and decided I was going to make a U-turn and come back later on to have lunch there. Everything seems so right about Frasier's, great menu great location and very friendly staff.

I ordered three-meat combo which was three bones of baby back ribs, burnt ends and pulled pork. My side items were French fries and green chili macaroni and cheese. I also ordered a cup of turkey gumbo.

The combo meal:
The meal was fine, but it was not great. I would say the best selection out of the 3 meat combo was the baby back ribs. The ribs were moist had decent smoke and had good flavor.

The burnt ends where not moist and very tough and chewy. It's always a delight to see someone outside of Missouri making burnt ends but when you are from Kansas City you are going to be hard when it comes to burnt ends because you know what right taste like and looks like.

The turkey gumbo: this was honestly my favorite dish out of everything I had. Very good roux it had turkey sausage which gave it an abundance of flavor.

grades:
Turkey gumbo- 9
ribs-7.5
burnt ends- 5.5
pulled pork-5

Maybe they had a bad day and they look like they know what they're doing so don't let my review scare you off still go by and give them a try. I eat a lot of barbecue all over the country so I'm going to be a pretty tough critic"}
{"text":"This place has the best competition style ribs that I've ever eaten in a restaurant. Fantastic. I would give them 10 stars, if could. Service is great and this place is always clean."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting from Los Angeles and wanted to explore Phoenix to its entirety, including the food! Even though I'm not a big barbecue person, I thoroughly enjoyed their chicken sandwich with their baked beans on the side. He loved their tri-tip sandwich. The restaurant itself was decorated with lots of funny signs and sports memorabilia, including a bar area where you can watch sports and enjoy a drink with your meal. Service was very nice and the manager/workers came over to us asking if we needed anything else several times during our visit."}
{"text":"Great burnt ends and baby back ribs! A little disappointed in the brisket and tri-tip. Beans and cream corn was fabulous but the coleslaw and mac-n-cheese was just ok. Went back the next day for more burnt ends and cream corn."}
{"text":"They have a good menu, and the service is pleasant, but there are some issues:   First of all, the tables are \"sticky\".  Two different people explained that \"it's just the finish\".  When I said that it makes the place seem less than clean, they both repeated that it's just the finish.  Paper towels STICK to the table tops.   That's just gross.
The chicken was dry ad tough, and the green chili mac and cheese was so overcooked that it had more of a texture of mashed potatoes.  When I commented on this, the same employees said that a \"new batch\" was just removed from the oven.   End of conversation.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I shared the 3 meat combo and with baked beans, cornbread and coleslaw. Which was ALOT of food!

The ribs and pulled pork were outstanding super tender, with a lot of smoke, natural flavors and not too greasy

The brisket was underwhelming and the reason for only 4 stars. While the brisket is tender it seems like it has been boiled or steamed and is flavorless without the house BBQ sauce [spicy sauce is Ab Fab!!]

The Texas toast side seemed superfluous and had prob been pre prepared as was soft and lukewarm.

We added a Takeout order of the pulled pork on our way out, to go with bean and coleslaw leftovers later!! Great service and perfect 'Q' ambience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Today my wife and I tried Frashers for the 2nd time. We were disappointed once again. We really wanted to like the food because the place looks nice and it's comfortable. You'll notice that most of the pictures are of the decor not the food. It's a little expensive for BBQ which I wouldn't mind if the food were good.I hope the owners and managers pay attention to the negative reviews because the pre-slicing of meat and the steam table is sucking the true flavor from the meat. I had a 3 meat platter with Tri Tip, Brisket and Ribs. The Ribs had a little smoke flavor but we're dry from being sliced ahead of time and the bark had little flavor. That was the good part, the Brisket and Tri Tip had no flavor at all. The steam table had sucked all the flavor from the beef. There was no bark on either meat, I'm sure it's at the bottom of the steam pan. My wife had pulled pork and it was dry and had no flavor either. The sides were ok, we had frys and slaw this time. The Mac and cheese was pretty good when we tried it the first time we tried Frashers. 

Owners please slice to order. The better BBQ places like Bryan's, Little Miss, or Pork on Fork all slice to order and it makes a huge difference. I'm sure you have great flavor when the meat comes off the smoker, I would really like to taste it. Good luck, I hope you can make some changes to improve the food. My BBQ friends and I will be waiting and watching we want to see you make it."}
{"text":"Catering review.

My work had Frasher's catered in to fill the gap between when our cafeteria closed and reopened and I was less than thrilled at the idea of having BBQ, even less thrilled at catered BBQ. 

I was so pleasantly surpised! I had the chicken breast -- cooked and seasoned very well, not one dry piece. I sampled all their BBQ sauces: spicy, sweet, and tangy. All good flavors but liked mixing the spicy and sweet the best. The cole slaw was crunchy and flavorful, the beans had large chunks of beef and had a nice smoky flavor, the potato salad was par for the tater salad course. And the butter cake was great. I thought to myself that it wasn't going to be good because only Mastro's does butter cake the way that i like it but i have to say. This butter cake was good too, not going to give Mastro's a run for their money but also not what I think Frasher's is going for. 

A total believer. If their catered food was this good, I bet dining in is 5 star worthy!"}
{"text":"They catered my son's wedding last night and did an amazing job; great food, plenty of it and very professional."}
{"text":"Damn good BBQ!!! New spot to visit everytime we visit Arizona. Great food, friendly service, great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great BBQ and fantastic service. Ribs and tritip were tender and Smokey.  Great fries but I like my Mac n cheese a little thicker.  It was still good. At the end of our meal they brought out some butter cake that made my cheeks sweat ;)"}
{"text":"The place looked like it was closed when we got there. But they welcomed us pleasantly and explained the menu. Great looking menu, we had the ribs 2lbs, chicken wings, garlic mashed potatoes, green chili macaroni, and spinach chips. These were the first ribs that I could say stand alone without any sauce. You put sauce on them it's that much better, three choices: Spicy, Tennessee Tang, or Sweet, all we're good. Chicken wings were huge and delicious. I would highly recommend this to everybody, good place, good people, good value."}
{"text":"The service at Frasher's was amazing. We just moved to the area and drive by this place everyday. We finally stopped in to try it out and weren't disappointed. Great food and great atmosphere. Highly recommend the mashed potatoes and corn bread. We will certainly be back soon!!"}

I can't say enough about how good the food was and the customer service was outstanding.  I'm so glad we found this place, we will be back. Thank you Frashers!"}
{"text":"I'm from Memphis and I know my BBQ. This place kills it' the pulled pork and brisket are amazing. They have several different BBQ sauces so you don't have to pick just one region. I'm also obsessed with their Mac-n-Cheese.

The best thing about BBQ joints is that they're quick. I highly recommend this place for their food and service."}
{"text":"From out of town and sounded good. After the lunch rush. Owner? Very friendly. Asks your name for your order and removers it through out your visit. Nice touch. I got brisket without the bread and broccoli offered as a side. Great for low carb lifestyle. Great food. Would have liked the meat a little father. Lol. I know very one pushed lean but there is another way of thinking."}
{"text":"So impressed! Went last night and I couldn't be more excited that this place is down the street.  The service was so nice, restaurant had a nice ambiance. We got wings to share- super amazing smoky flavor with the best ranch! We shared tender ribs with mac n chz & cole slaw. This is a great place to share food that way you can try a few things. 

On the way out we decided to take lemonade, gumbo, corn bread.... and more mac n chz Togo. The gumbo has such authentic flavor. After eating more tonight for dinner I wished I could have just gone back again lol.

Wish I had pictures. Oh and the BBQ sauce- bomb.

Go! :)"}

The beef brisket, if that's what you want to call it, tasted like one of those microwave barbecue meats that you buy at the grocery store in those black plastic microwave trays, there was not a drop of a seasoning on the so called brisket, not any smoked taste, it was as tough as shoe leather, and it actually looked like it was boiled, if that is possible, the fries were those huge steak fries that were clearly frozen, the corn was nothing more than canned corn that they doctored, the so called \"Texas toast\" that they gave with the meal was the consistency of mush, the ribs had zero taste, and the barbecue sauce was doctored K.C. Masterpiece.  And $40.00 later!!!Steer clear!!!"}
{"text":"First of all the people are very bubbly and welcoming! The people alone are a reason to eat here. The decor is southern country very cool. We ordered them picked a table. They gave a great military discount but prices were affordable too. The ribs and brisket were tender and flavorful. They had delicious sides too mac n cheese has corn in it which I never had but trust me it was wonderful! The corn and beans were great too! They put their own spin on every fish and did it well. We will be back and will recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"This BBQ is amazing!! I love it, it has to be one of the best  in town!! We had 3 different meals, and they all where cook perfectly! From my experience with BBQ I know it's not easy! The chefs are on point! The staff is very friendly and the decor fits with the food! I feel at home it's definitely a must stop for yummy food and a great experience.."}
{"text":"We were in town for the Cavs and Indians games and NEEDED some meat. Frasher's came up and we showed up to some seriously good service. And the MEATY BBQ pizza was so unique. Eating those burnt ends and jalapeños, on their front patio, was spot-on. The fresh corn and green chile mac & cheese were packed with flavor. But our highlight was meeting George, the owner, as he showed us the smoker and how it worked, right behind us. Last but NOT least, their Gooey Butter Cake was UNREAL. I travel quite a bit and don't drink alcohol, so I'm always seeking out another drug: sugar. The cake was UNIQUE and caused me to laugh, that's how good it is. Get it and like and thank them for the experience. MONEY."}
{"text":"They say you can't have good, fast, and cheap. If it's fast and cheap it won't be good. That's why I was nervous when my order for 1/2 pound of ribs and two sides for under $15 came to me in less than 10 minutes. Was preparing my mind to order something else once I got to my hotel room and disappointed by a low quality meal. I was shocked! The ribs were absolutely incredible! The sides were good, too. Will return next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came in for a second try after the first attempt was thwarted when everything was sold out. Had visited Frasher's steakhouse in the past and really enjoyed it. Sad to say the new concept just didn't appeal to me. 

Overall my sense was meh. It was not the best, not the worst but meh. Could give the benefit of doubt that maybe I just ordered the wrong things (always a possibility). Wife and I had Burnt ends (which are usually yummy), tri-tip platter side of the corn. Burnt ends which are an item we would usually really enjoy just seemed bland. No real flavor to it apart from the overall smokeyness of the meat. Trip top was about the same, almost seemed like all the juice had been sucked out and both items were just a bit dried out. 

This place is right in the neighborhood so I am sure we will be back at some point. Hopefully it will end with a better experience."}
{"text":"True smokehouse flavor!  Delicious and reasonably priced quality BBQ.  Had the four meat combo(ribs, brisket, pulled pork and burnt ends), pulled pork sandwich and smoked turkey gumbo.   Will have all again.   Looking forward to the wings next.."}
{"text":"Spent out Easter with Frasher's Togo. To say the service is EGG-cellent is an understatement. I don't know if I've placed a carry out order with such ease....  Ever! We went in and only had to wait a few moments before they gathered our order. When getting home everything was packed so neatly and all the sauces, wipes, cutlery was inside. The meat combo with brisket & chicken was standard, the Mac and cheese and corn were good. The sauces were really well done tangy, sweet, and hot is the best. GET THE BUTTER CAKE! Will be coming back"}
{"text":"By far the best barbecue in the Valley that I have found thus far. 

For not being a fan of turkey, this was the best thing I had on the menu! The Gumbo was out of this world, and paired with the jalapeño cornbread, you can't out do it! 

I can't say enough great things about this place."}
{"text":"No question this is what BBQ is all about , first time here , the smell alone when we walked in the door we knew we were in for a treat , I tried the chicken platter and wife had the ribs , both were delicious but we both leaned towards the fall of the bone ribs , we tried 4 different sides , fries , jalapeno Mac n cheese , corn and beans , hands down the beans were awesome , Mac n cheese also very good , can't wait to go back seeing as Im doing some work near by ,  forgot even there lemonade was very good  , not to mention the staff was very friendly , see you soon"}
{"text":"We had the perfect BBQ meal. George and his crew are serving fantastic BBQ with all the right flavors and textures. Everything from the highest quality meats, delicious sides, to the variety of savory house made sauces, will have you wanting more. 

...MAKE SURE YOU GET THE OOWEY GOOWEY BUTTER CAKE FOR DESSERT!"}
{"text":"Good service food was good, I had the brisket and ribs, and bbq beans and mashed potatoes. I'll pass on the mash potatoes and try something else next time."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to their Gooey Butter Cake at the Food & Wine Festival in 2016.  So, I knew I had to stop in and try their food.  I ordered their 2 Meat Combo (St Louis Ribs & Brisket) which comes with choice of 2 sides (Green Chili Mac & Cheese and Garlic Mashed Potatoes) along with Texas Toast.  The toast was ok, but everything else was really good.  Seasoned well and I used the Spicy sauce, which had great flavor as well.  The cashier/order taker, was very friendly.  You order upfront and they bring you the order.  Nice size restaurant and plenty of parking.  I would definitely go back.  I didn't order the Gooey cake this time, because the food portions are a good size."}
{"text":"What a great spot.  Nice decor, simple but outstanding menu.   I'm have had the chicken, turkey, and brisket so far and all have been top notch."}
{"text":"They just opened so they are slowly adding more to the food and drink menus but, this place is so neat, it's modern/rustic decor and I love the walls they old wall paper simply painted as well as old brick showing thru. The old refurbished wood tables and trimmings add a ton of character too. The food is bomb, if you like smokehouse food this is one place you should check out. It picks up in the evening and weekend but for now they close at 8 so come for dinner or take out. Take out is less than 10 min and all smoke did is made fresh reach day! So come hungry Cuz anything you order is unique and amazing. Sauce is crazy tasty, the staff is fun and once again the food is so bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Hell yeah.   Found out Monday was Pastrami Day
First of all in Phoenix you can not get good or even descent pastrami because everyone serves Deli Pastrami.  I had the Pastrami Rueben and ask if they could out Coleslaw instead of Kraut BOMB 
Nothing else to say.  So good to one to Go for a friend so hey can try Real Pastrami.  

Had the Beans for a side. And they let me sample their Gumbo.  Everything was on Point

Can't wait to come back and owner hinted about doing some St Louis style Pizza.  Yum."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious barbecue. Last night was our first time here, so we went with the 4-meat platter in an effort to sample everything. Best. Chicken. EVER. Dry smoky and so flavorful. We also loved the baby back ribs and the tri-tip. I love me some well-made mashed potatoes and holy cow, the garlic mashed potatoes did not disappoint. Tasted exactly like my mother's famous mashed potatoes! Now I don't have to wait for Thanksgiving whenever I get the craving . When the nice guy at the counter heard it was our first visit, he brought us a slice of the gooey butter cake on the house. Oh my goodness. Really, OH MY GOODNESS. I'm the type that would always order dessert first if it were socially acceptable (okay okay, if my husband would let me ) and this dessert BLEW MY MIND. I truly don't think I can waste my time on a lesser dessert ever again, that's how good it was. If I were still pregnant, it would have seriously brought me to tears of joy."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday and it was WONDERFUL.  The staff were so nice to us and the food was great.  I highly recommend getting the Burnt Ends, so yummy! Frasher's will be a regular stop for us, whenever we're in Phoenix.
The restaurant's clean and nicely decorated, the food is great and the staff are very accommodating and have a great attitude.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Stay away from the brisket and Burt ends. The brisket is all meat no char and no fat. The Burt ends is all fat. The chicken is good and green chili Mac and cheese is ok. Unless you are craving chicken I find it not worth the 5 minute trip from the office."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a 4 meat platter which was perfect for two and they split it up for is! We got ribs, turkey, pulled pork, and tri trip. All the meat was moist and excellent, except the ribs could have been better, had some dry spots and was firmly attached to the bone.
The sides here leave something to be desired. No green beans or collards, no vegetables as sides or you can pay extra to do a side salad. Baked beans were a bit spicy and the mashed potatoes while they tasted good, looked a lot like they came out of the freezer."}
{"text":"Been there four times now. Really liked the burnt ends, brisket and tri-tip, good smokey flavor and really juicy brisket that's not dry and crumbling like some other places. I thought the turkey was underwhelming, but then again, I shouldn't be getting turkey when there's other better meat to be had. Spicy sauce is really good. The space has a nice build out and is welcoming, though I agree with another reviewer that the food delivery system (wandering around the place calling out names for each item) is inefficient. What got me was the prices versus portion sizes, as well as the sides. They don't really offer a complete meal with meat and a side or two, but rather everything is a la carte. So if you want a half pound of meat, a side, and a drink, you're looking at well over $20. While the food's good I just can't see that lasting in this neighborhood...might want to consider a price adjustment or a meal deal where someone can sample a couple meats and a side."}
{"text":"Really tasty.  Customer service was amazing.  I had the tri tip. It was very flavorful.  I love how you pick your own sauce.  I had the sweet.  Would definitely come back if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"came here with all my Phoenix family. I ordered the brisket sandwich and the green chili mac n cheese. My cousin recommended this place and I warned the family that I wasn't the one because its usually me. I wish I was the one because it was pretty good. 
My brisket was tender and good flavor.
a good mac n cheese is really hard to find and this one might be one of my favorites. 
My grandma gave me half of her pulled pork sandwhich and I didn't touch it, the bread was completely soaked and the pulled pork looked like sloppy joe, my aunt complained about hers also. 
stick to the brisket or tri tip and stay away from the pulled pork"}
{"text":"Really great BBQ food and great atmosphere and staff! Also really great Bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"I was bummed  the old location  closed because  it  was  a spot to gather with fellow Cardinals  fans to watch the games. That'd be St Louis  Cardinals,  who cares about the Phoenix Cardinals,  sorry.  ;)

I was so so sad.  

Tuens out they opened a new spot. 
The owner is great  as always.  Food is delish. Tender meat. Personally I love the pulled pork. The jalapeño  bread is amazing and the gooey butter cake victory die for.  

They have tvs  add on you can watch the Cardinals  games, but I miss toasted  ravioli!  ;)"}
{"text":"I only got the macaroni and cheese here, but tried my husband's pork, beans, and garlic mashed potatoes.  I thought everything was alright.  There wasn't anything absolutely amazing in terms of the BBQ.  For dessert though, they gave us buttered cake, which seriously was to die-for and is probably the only thing I would come back to get."}
{"text":"We stopped by this restaurant for lunch, let me start off by saying this place is super cute and very inviting. We got the 4 meats brisket, pulled pork, tri tip, chicken and let me just say delish, delish!!!!!!! The staff was great the wait was not long at all. We also got Mac and cheese and corn as the sides again delish and for dessert the ooey gooey delish!!! I have no bad things to say I recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"If you enjoy true high quality barbecue, fresh from the smoker or grill, this is your place! The service is first rate, the food incredible and the sauces are to die for. Do yourself a favor and stop in for a platter today! 

Don't miss the green chili mac &a cheese and the gooey butter cake! Pulled pork lovers rejoice, they got ya covered too!"}
{"text":"I originally gave them 2 Stars.   Giving 4 Stars now for their ribs 3 stars overall.  Ribs are smoky and have a great bark.  My brisket was dry and not much bark and wasn't good.  I will be back for the ribs for sure."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  The ribs were excellent.   Baked beans were very good also.  I will get a full rack next time I am in town"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I didn't try the meat because, well, I don't eat land animals. My Midwest family got some smoked turkey and pork sandwiches and the consensus was that their lunch was \"Good, but expensive.\"

We came here because we are a Saint Louis people and Saint Louis people 1 apparently love BBQ and 2 love scouting out other Saint Louis people, and this place is run by a STL family. I grabbed a salad, average, but was impressed with my green chili mac n cheese (it had corn and red peppers in there too!) and the gooey butter cake. No one can make gooey butter cake like my mom, but this was pretty good.

The inside design was cool and the kids staffing the counter were friendly and talkative. Pretty much everything is ala cart. If you like meat and eating in places with that smoke house smell and you aren't on a budget this is a good place to try."}
{"text":"Attended a wedding last night where Frasher's catered the event. AMAZING. I'm from the South, and this BBQ blows away anything I can find in Atlanta! The jalapeño Mac & Cheese is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! My mouth was just in awwww its delicious! I had the pulled pork with a side of green Chile Mac and cheese, I also tried some of my hubbys burnt end sandwich and baked beans, and yeah its good! This place has a great presentation inside and out, friendly staff, great portions too!"}
{"text":"Good place for good BBQ!! Their cornbread is very good and the baby back ribs are very tasty!"}
{"text":"Going down the list of best BBQ's in Phoenix and ruling them out:
1. Little Miss...closes early, too long of a wait
2. Bobby Q's...been there too many times
3. Texas BBQ House...closes at 7pm
4. Frasher's...never heard of it, stumbled across it for first time on Yelp, decided to give it a go.

Best Friday night dining decisions in a long time!
Service was excellent as in other reviews, baby backs were top notch, meaty, fresh, perfectly seasoned.  I asked about the mac and cheese and was given an honest answer about it being your standard boxed mac and cheese spiced up so I passed, why set myself up?  I had the turkey gumbo and it was such a nice alternative to your standard gumbo with too much fish and sausage for my taste, had a great kick that was offset by white rice to soothe the spiciness.  Hubs had the tri-tip and liked it a lot, he liked the slaw and beans as well.  I am a sugar addict so I took a slice of  gooey butter cake to go and added a scoop of vanilla ice cream and lounged with it- never had butter cake, would eat it every day now if i could, so good, really, really good.  

Loved the barrels sinks in washrooms and the space is quite inviting. We are in north Phoenix so the drive was not the most convenient but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"New places can be a little scary for the first few months...they haven't figured everything out between the food and the service and as excited as we always are for new places, we don't want to be let down because the company hasn't gotten their stuff together yet, but this place...as far as I am concerned, has got it together. 

We went for lunch and sat at the bar and had a great server/bartender who chatted with us but also left us alone if we were eating or talking with each other - he was great. He suggested a few things on the menu - like the tri tip instead of the brisket - which were good. We got the three meat platter, green chili mac and cheese and the chicken wings. The chicken and pulled pork were the favorites while the tri tip was good...we liked the others better. Our favorite sauce was the Tennessee sauce - tangy and spicy and I could have drank the stuff. The mac and cheese was delicious as well! Some of our favorite wings are the grilled wings we get at LGO and Frasher's was up to par with their wings - yes that good. 

I loved what they did inside compared to how the old Baja Loco was. It was natural wood and a great, simple vibe focusing on the food and service. The patio has upgraded furniture which looks comfortable and inviting and we can't wait to go back and hang out there. 

George, the owner, was there and making his rounds. He seemed like a really cool guy and was really proud of his product...as he should be. I would love to go back and chat with him again and try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were out and about driving around town and we can across this place and exuded to try it because he loves BBQ. We come in not knowing a thug other than the other yelp reviews we saw online. The girl at the front counter was rude and didn't even offer to help us with anything we had to ask questions. Do we seat ourselves? Do we order now or when we sit? She didn't even point us to the self serve soda machine. Our food came very quick maybe less than 10 min. It was not as great as we had hoped. It didn't even look like authentic bbq it looked like it was all just taken out of the microwave and thrown on the plate. Not an ounce of fat or burned pieces it didn't even look like BBQ! The sauces were good. The side I had was Mac and cheese it was horrible and not even creamy it was runny and gross. Maybe it's different BC it's St Louis style and not Texas style buttt I don't think we will be back here. Horrible service bad attitudes and mediocre food. Below is a picture of my soggy bread that my chopped pork came on."}
{"text":"Tri tip sandwich was mmmmmm good, midnight train to Memphis. Plenty of room and nice bar along with outdoor seating. Would def come back"}
{"text":"Wow, been looking for a good BBQ place and just found them.    Food was wonderful and service was too.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch.  Great pulled pork sandwich, great price, and really friendly and courteous staff.  Definitely recommend this plate if your nearby!"}
{"text":"It's about time I found a rib joint that can live up to St. Louis ribs. Go figure the owner is from the Lou! No fancy words needed. Get a slab of ribs with the ridiculous beans and you won't be let down. If you have a sweet tooth you have to try the gooey butter cake. A St. Louis tradition created by a culinary mistake."}
{"text":"AWSOME   We really enjoyed it. Great food and the owner greats u at the door. George.   His staff is great   Our new favorite Arcadia/Biltmore BBQ. Thanks George"}
{"text":"Hop back in the car and drive to naked bbq or head to little miss this place is not like his old restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered the pulled pork platter (son) and sandwich (me).  The meat was cooked to perfection.  Unfortunately, the sauce was just ok.  Nothing too extraordinary.  I like spicy, vinegary sauce, and theirs had very mild kick and slightly sweet and syrupy.  I also ordered a half dozen wings, which I would avoid altogether.  They bread and fry the wings (like you would find at Hooters), and drench them in their sauce.  I ate three and threw the others away... they were that bad.  The interior is cool, and the staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Saw on DDD and normally I'm impressed with DDD places. Saying that I have pretty high standards for bbq. Especially if you've ever been to Smoques in Chicago. This place smokes there meat and I had Sliced Brisket and Baby Back Ribs, both in which where bland. Bbq sauce was good but really good bbq doesn't need a lot and this place does. Coleslaw was super bland but fresh and crip, bbq bean where ok at best. Lemonade was very good and overall ambiance was nice, very cool outdoor seating area but off Indian School road so a little noisy. Service was very good, fast and friend and that's why 3 stars. If looking for ok bbq and nothing else is open it'll at least satisfy the need."}
{"text":"Frasher's is a BBQ Smokehouse that is hands down a FANTASTIC place to go for a meal, either with or with out children. The staff is incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable of their menu and (who I assumed to be) the owner's son had the most charismatic smile that oozed charm. The bar tender was very upbeat and friendly. The patio seating is comfortable and the interior casual with booths and tables to choose from.  Now, let's get serious for a minute. The pulled pork was wonderful; and as a Southern woman, I take my BBQ seriously; it was prepared and seasoned PERFECTLY. The butter cake, y'all. It is life changing. Eat. Frasher's.  Go there, right now."}
{"text":"Went in tonight and ordered two three meat combos. After we ordered five more customers walked in.  They all got their orders before we did. I walk up and ask why the girl asked my name and said it is here now.  She then gave two more orders out.  Then gave us ours not even a sorry for the wait.  We get home and my order was wrong.  What a disappointment and the food was not that great.  I will not recommend this place.  For the money I spent the food and service should be better than what we receive.  I work for a hotel and my clients ask me all the time for a great place to eat BBQ. This will not be one I recommend 
The sad part is I have to give one star or this will not post"}
{"text":"Can in with some buddies!  Food was amazing!   Sat at the bartop, had a great vibe and George the owner was personable and made dinner even better. Nice to see an owner take pride in what they do!"}
{"text":"Righteous BBQ plus all the St. Louis specialty foods. Burnt ends, gooey butter cake, thin crust pizza with provel cheese Evan fried ravioli. Good mix of sauces to put on the meat since it comes without any already on it.  Definitely coming back to try the tri-tip. 
 
Was there at 5:30 not so busy, but was packed shortly thereafter"}
{"text":"Dry, dry, dry and tasteless.  Went based on the many wonderful reviews.  Had ribs and brisket.  The brisket was dry and tasteless and the ribs weren't much better.  No falling off the bone meat in this place.  After placing our order at the counter our plates came out in 10 seconds flat, meaning it's sitting in the kitchen under warmers until served.  This makes for DRY meat.  Everything was room temp including the mac and cheese and potatoes.  The garlic mashed potatoes had no garlic in them.  The mac and cheese was a soupy, tasteless mess.  The cornbread was good and my husbands fries were hit.  $41 later we were very disappointed.  I sent my entire meal back.  One positive note, George and his staff are very nice people.  If you've been to Joe's real BBQ in Gilbert (where the lines to order is often out the front door) then you've had good BBQ."}
{"text":"Great brisket, generous portions, nice atmosphere. Tangy sauce was delicious. Loved the side corn, really fresh. Cole slaw needs a little help- pretty bland, no dressing to be found- maybe I got a bad scoop. Gooey butter cake was amazing. Good service, friendly attentive staff."}
{"text":"I live down the block-- saw under construction and for a while was excited, anxiously waiting the arrival of what I was praying would be good local BBQ when suddenly I drove by and found that Frasiers was open! Yay!

Merely 2 days later- my wife and I embarked on the journey which is a meal from which I'm still stuffed to this moment.

We got brisket, chicken and pulled pork- all of which were top notch. Loved the BBQ sauce. The sides were good too, especially the corn and fries (we also tried the Mac and cheese).

While the meat itself and convenience earns this place a well deserved 5 stars, there are significant needs for improvement in this new establishment:

-Mac and cheese: was fair at best, it had the texture and monotonous flavor of a KFC Mac and cheese with some green chilies mixed in. The flavor had little to no depth.

-Toast/bread was boring and generic

-service still has kinks that need to be worked out (a little slow and they had run out of regular napkins and were passing around a large paper towel napkin rolls as a backup)


These flaws in mind- definitely won't stop my next visit. I genuinely enjoyed my meal and look forward to trying turkey, ribs, cole slaw and baked beans next time. So happy to have a new and great BBQ joint so close to home! 

Try it!"}
{"text":"First time at Frasher's Smokehouse last night.  OMG was it good.  Every new item served seemed to be better than the last.  The cornbread and hush puppies were great.  The chicken wings and ribs outstanding.  The souses were so good, almost could eat them on a spoon.  We live in Fountain Hills, but worth the drive.  The atmosphere was wonderful, the decor keep you rubber necking.  And the staff couldn't have been nicer,  William"}
{"text":"Clarification as this was a quick lunch pick up order and not a full on dining experience. 

Service was excellent the cashier was accommodating to my brisket sandwich order and the wait was no more than 10 mins. 

Food - I am a bit of a connoisseur of BBQ having competed back in Texas for a couple of years and our team has even placed in some (credentials). The brisket flavor was mild in smoke and lean. Due to the leanness the brisket was a little on the dry side and it appeared they were using be brisket flat which yields leaner cuts. My failure was not asking for marbled cuts since I was in a bit of a rush, not sure if they have that. I am not knocking this some people like it dryer, I just like my cuts from the point with more natural juices. Back to the flavor it being mild in smoke didn't make it so rich and overwhelming as some. The sandwich paired with their spicy sauce made for an excellent lunch. I like my sandwiches with onions and pickles which is a Texas staple. The coleslaw was standard nothing outstanding but still good. The sauce is more of a Memphis/KC style sauce but it was good. 

I would go again to try other items and go with a little more time."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here (him being a massive BBQ critic) and the result was OUTSTANDING! He literally ordered one of everything on the menu and was not disappointed. George is the owner and is awesome at not only smoking delicious meat but is a really cool dude! George has an extensive history in BBQ and incorporates different styles from around the nation in his very modern BBQ restaurant. Very pleased with this experience overall and can't wait to come back for some more delicious food!"}
{"text":"I'm from KC so I'm a bit of a BBC snob and this place is great. Ribs are fall off the bone delicious and the other food has great flavor. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Nothing terribly wrong with this place at all.  But the food is just OKAY.  It is a little bland.  \"Vanilla\" as some would say.  And once you factor in their [high] prices for a casual setting, we're down to three stars.  A passing grade, but not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! My husband and I were craving BBQ one night and stumbled upon this place and got the ribs, which were the best we've ever had in AZ. We later had them cater a pool party for us this weekend and George was a pleasure to work with. He was very kind and professional, and prepped/set-up all the food for us in a matter of minutes. So many people at the party raved about the food! We will definitely be returning for their business!"}
{"text":"We went to Frasher's a couple of days ago. We didn't  realize that they closed at 8 pmm. The guy at the register stated that they were closing in a few minutes and that we could order to go. We decided to leave along with another family. There was another couple looking at the menu outside and we told them they were closing which they too were disappointed. We were getting into our cars when the owner came running out and told us not to leave that we could still order and eat in. We decided to stay along with the others only because there bbq (all of it) is delicious!!! We were also given free dessert!! Will we go back, heck yes!!!"}
{"text":"Bbq is pretty good. The bar has limited options. Menu is a little pricey for portion sizes. I got the general feeling that they were feeling out their market before formalizing their menu etc. will return nonetheless"}
{"text":"Best BBQ around. This place is great and doesn't compare to the corporate BBQ places around. George the owner is on site and makes you feel really welcome. Even remembered us coming back for the second time around. We tried ever meat they offer and the green chili mac and cheese is to die for. Also, you have to try the corn bread. BBQ sauce is amazing and very unique. LOVE COMING HERE!!"}
{"text":"The service was top notch and the pulled pork was amazing. The baked beans were like nothing I've ever had before smoky and a little of spice. Over all I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a good BBQ place."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite bbq spot in Phoenix so far! We walked in and the owner greeted us with his beautiful blue eyes! I'm a real skeptic when it comes BBQ because I'm from Cleveland and Cleveland has GREAT BBQ! 
We got flash fried spinach, beans, garlic mash and corn! All of the sides are super flavorful!
We also tried both the brisket and turkey. 
You know a good piece of BBQ if you don't need bbq sauce! And this is it! Love love love
Thank you George (owner)!!!"}
{"text":"The BBQ here is the best! 

-The food here is spectacular, and they take great pride in it being top notch.
-Not only is the food great, but the service can't be beat. Everyone is unbelievably accommodating, friendly, and there to make sure you love your experience.
-The atmosphere is warm and inviting; it is easy to relax and enjoy. 

Tip: Make sure to order burnt ends, beans, and butter cake...you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"As a teen my family owned bbq restaurants and we had phenomenal bbq. I have not had that good of bbq again until eating at Fraser's. Absolutely amazing meat. Try the mac n cheese as well."}
{"text":"Holy cow! My first BBQ experience in Phoenix was great! I love the laid back atmosphere; the disposable dinnerware and self bussing tables makes it feel like you're at someone's house, not a restaurant. The smoke on the ribs was perfect.  The chili beans are just like my dad makes. My only negative is that the noodles in the green chile mac were overcooked. Other than that, I was not disappointed. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My first time today at this BBQ restaurant, which has been open for about 8 months, according to the very friendly employee who came to clear my plates. 

I arrived shortly before 2 PM on a Wednesday, just outside of the peak lunch period, and during my roughly 30 minutes in the restaurant I was the only customer around.  The interior decor is rather simple and rustic, but comfortable, and a nice repertoire of blues tunes played in the background through speakers.

You order your food from the counter, and your order is then delivered to your table on a plastic plate.   You then pick up your plastic utensils from a common table which also contains a selection of three house BBQ sauces.   I tried the \"Spicy\" and \"Tennessee Tang\"  sauces.  The former is a thick red sauce with only mild heat, but it was still quite flavorful.  (Might be more accurate to label it \"A Tiny Bit Spicy.\")  The latter sauce is thinner in consistency, and it too has a modest amount of tang, but it still nicely complimented the smoked pulled pork and chicken that I ordered.

The pulled pork and chicken were tasty, with a nice smoked flavor.  I would describe both meat selections as neither too dry nor ideally moist.  They were both tasty and flavorful, though perhaps not exceptional.

My chosen sides were green chili mac & cheese and corn.   The corn was firm, with the right amount of crunch (who likes soggy corn anyway?), and my guess is that it is served straight from a can.  The green chili mac & cheese was good, though, once again, not exceptional.  There was almost no perceptible heat.   As other reviewers have noted, the cheese sauce is also very thin and watery, and not very \"cheesy.\"  Still, it was tasty, and I finished the modest portion of this side without regret!

My lunch bill totaled $17, a bit pricy given that the food was not exceptional, and the portions were on the small side.   The folks behind the counter were friendly and enthusiastic (at times, they seemed to be trying a bit too hard to enthusiastically welcome me as a new customer...).

As this was my first visit to this BBQ joint, I will definitely need to come back a few times to sample other items on their menu.  I did enjoy my meal, and the exuberant service, although the price seemed a bit on the high side (for the reasons that I've already mentioned, above).

Based upon this one experience, I don't think that I'd drive across the Valley to dine here.  But we live relatively close to this restaurant, and i believe in supporting independent/local restaurants, and so I do plan to return for at least a second visit."}
{"text":"Having waited as long as I could for the opening jitters to clear and for Frasher's to dial things in, I think I timed it perfectly.  A quiet Monday lunch, I was there five minutes after opening, so I could be sure to get everything I wanted.  We were greeted with a smile as we perused the menu.

They've got Brisket, Chicken, Turkey, Burnt Ends and some other stuff.  Sorry, I just homed in on what I was hungry for.  It was tough to decide, so we spread it out.  Everything is sold by the pound which makes it easier to order different items, like you are not stuck with a half-pound of something when you want to try other things.  The meats (except chicken wings) come dry, and they provide squirt bottles of a sweet and a hot bbq sauce.  I tried the hot and it was awesome.  Not really hot, but very tasty.

They got my vote.  The brisket has just enough chew to it so that it does not fall apart all over the place, The burnt ends are a tasty treat and the chicken wings are large and freshly-cooked, slathered with a mild hot sauce they are actually \"finger-licking good\"  We also had the green-chile mac which sported a very mild green-chile flavor and was a bit thick.  I prefer my mac a bit creamier, but I can live with this version.

The only real problem I had was that they served our dishes in takeaway containers.  Which would be okay if we were actually ordering to go.  We were dining in and it was difficult to grab the brisket sandwich out of the tight-fitting container.  I would suggest that they provide plates for dine-in customers."}
{"text":"Went yesterday, it was a cool place.  Got medium brisket with 2 sides.  Owner was very nice and checked on us as we sat outside.

Brisket was nice, I like it a little fatter but it was decent.

The jalapeño Mac and cheese was pretty bland but beans and corn  were good.   The lemonade was little weak but it's hard find good lemonade.

Overall good, I'll be back.

$40 for 2 med brisket platters, left pretty full and happy."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had in Phoenix. New restaurant that I hope people find out about and keep it thriving. Nice outdoor seating and the inside smells divine. Very friendly staff and you order the register and it's a pretty quick turnaround to when your food arrives. 

Just sooooo good. Prices are great. $8 to $10 is the average.

The sides were fine. I liked the corn, Mac and cheese was ok as were the mashed potatoes. But the ribs, oh, my heaven, were the best ever."}
{"text":"I am in love with Frasher's Smokehouse not only for the food, but because the staff is always engaging, informative and appear to genuinely enjoy being helpful.

As a St Louis transplant, I am super fond of the St Louis style pizza, think IMO's.  Thin crust with Provel cheese! Oh, that cheese!  The toasted ravioli are equal to what I eat when in the Lou. And of course I must get the token gooey butter cake to round out the meal of my dreams. 

Tonight when it was discovered that our order had inadvertently been given to the wrong customer, the staff bent over backwards to get our order out pronto, but they also gave us a few extra goodies at no charge.  I have worked food service and I understand how this sort of thing can occur. No big deal. But, the manner in which it was handled was such a pleasant surprise.  Kudos to everyone working tonight!  

My husband is of the gluten free variety so he always orders the BBQ. The ribs tonight were especially meaty and very moist. Next time there we want to try the turkey everyone raves about. 

Be sure to visit the First Friday of every month for the pizza, ravioli and gooey butter cake. It is limited, but worth the 29 day wait each month. 

I understand why you have lasted nearly 18 years in the BBQ business. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great local, easy to find! This place is close to my house and I drove by it with the intention to go someday. I finally got to check it out yesterday. You order at the counter, menu is pretty straight forward. Friendly staff brings your food to your table. They have 3 house made bbq sauces, my favorite was the spicy. Least favorite was the sweet- tasted like chocolate and that is not the flavor I want on my ribs! Yuck! My boyfriend and I shared the baby back ribs and some chicken wings. Baby back ribs were ok- a little dry and plain for my taste, I had to add a lot of bbq sauce to enjoy. Don't get the coleslaw- doesn't taste like anything! Meat filled chicken wings were excellent, hot sauce was just right! They also came with a generous portion of carrots and celery sticks. I would come back again just to try their sandwiches and to see what the buttery cake dessert is all about..."}
{"text":"Not good! Ribs were only thing good. Brisket was cold in cold juice so obviously it's not fresh. Mac and cheese had no flavor. I had to clean my own table, get up 4 times for service. Owner and staff focused on the owners friends that came in and forgot about everyone else. Fries were the best thing. Slaw was bad and mash potatoes say they are garlic mash potato but u can taste the garlic powder instead of raw garlic like it should have. Very disappointing dinner and waste of $48.00."}
{"text":"This was literally a last minute decision to stop here, and I'm really glad we did.  This place has only been opened for about 2 months.  They have their grand opening coming up the second week of September.  The decor is great, I love the simplicity of the menu and the staff was friendly.  We ordered the 3 meat combo and had pulled pork and brisket x 2.  Both meats were wonderful and the homemade sauces are amazing.  Both my boyfriend and I say the Spicy wins but the others are really good as well.  Tennessee Tangy and Sweet and then some tangy mustard that we did not try.  There are plenty of sides to choose from, dessert (gooey butter cake - sounds amazing) and a kids menu.  One thing I noticed while we ate was that the staff was always moving and busy.  All three FOH girls were productive the entire time whether they were checking on customers, refilling sauce containers, bussing tables, general cleaning up and restocking, etc.  I was very impressed.  Overall, a fantastic experience and we will be sure to give more of the menu a try next time!"}
{"text":"Have always heard great things so I stopped in for lunch before heading to the airport for a afternoon flight. Food was absolutely amazing. Ribs, smoked turkey, gumbo, cornbread and gooey butter cake were all top notch. Also, tried the wings which were stellar. Fried, then grilled=AMAZING. George the owner and his staff were super friendly and you can tell they love what they do. Cant wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"So very different than the old Frahers on Scottsdale Rd that you wouldn't know that they moved because it is so very different.  Much more like a midwestern bbq restaurant than a dark dive bar as it was.  The menu was small but everything we ordered was good.  The chicken wings were the bomb.  The smoker is outside the front patio.  They have a small bar area but it isn't the kind of place you'd want to hang out in but the beverages are more just to go along with the meal.  Had a very small selection of craft beer and well drinks.  Service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Not sure how anyone could give this place anything less then 5 stars. The food is absolutely amazing. BEST BBQ IN PHOENIX. The service was stellar and the patio is awesome. Clean and most certainly a great place. The brisket is perfect. I recommend getting it a little fatty. The pulled pork is PERFECT. The rib tips are out of this world."}
{"text":"Great food here. The meat was all tender and smoky. I tried brisket, pulled pork, and turkey in a combo platter. They were all delicious, but the turkey and pork were amazing. Plus, the green chile Mac and cheese was super creamy. Friendly staff and blues playing in the background topped off the experience. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"As promised in my first Yelp review, we returned for our second family dinner exactly one week later. I'm happy to say everything went great again. The smoked turkey and brisket are exceptional. This time we also tried the tri-tip and it, too, tasted great   We couldn't miss the gooey butter cake!  This time we tried the AZ red wine blend-- another good choice. Say hi to Pete when you go. You and your taste buds will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Lordy!!

I wasn't expecting that!! Amazing BBQ that requires no sauce (but try the spicy sauce)  I'm sorta sad I didn't find this place before - just the perfect amount of smoke !! I'll definitely be back here!


And whatever you do... don't leave without having some \"gooey butter cake\" OMG!!"}
{"text":"Really great BBQ. Amazing smoked turkey, some of the best I have ever had and good corn bread with a honey butter drizzle. The Green Chili Mac and Cheese was ok but grew on me when I got addicted to their Spicy BBQ Sauce. Not very busy which is unfortunate because I want them to stay around to feed my BBQ cravings!"}
{"text":"One simple comment to the owner of Frasher's:  please go to Little Miss Barbecue at 4301 East University Drive in Phoenix and try to do what they do."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed especially after seeing this restaurant has 4 stars! The only decent thing we had were the baby back ribs. Other than that the pulled pork was beyond dry and had an old taste, brisket was also dry, Mac and cheese was overcooked and watery not cheesy (I would have rather had Kraft Mac and cheese) and the corn definitely came from a can and also sat way too long until it was soggy. Basically everything has clearly been sitting in warmers all day and not at all fresh. 

I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Best brisket sandwich we ever had. Service was 10 stars, can highly recommend this place. Don't forget to try the gooey butter cake, absolutely delicious. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place was a Huge disappointment. Everything is ala carte and over priced. No BBQ sauce on the meat yet this is supposed to be a BBQ place?? The \"meat\" was ALL fat and very little meat on the brisket sandwich..threw half of it away and went to McDonald's!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this sweet bbq place while visiting Phoenix. The place has a nice smokehouse feel when you first walk in. We were greeted immediately and looked over the simple, yet adequate menu. I decided to order the 3 meet sampler, and my meat choices were pulled pork, ribs and brisket. It came with two
Sides so I took the cole slaw and mashed potatoes. The wife ordered burnt ends, beans and cole slaw.

If you're like me, then you've probably had some dry brisket. The brisket at Frasher's was incredibly moist and it was the best I've ever had. It was tender and juicy and had just the right amount of smoke. The ribs were good, a tad dry but packed full of flavor. The pulled pork was moist and piled high. The smoke flavor was a tad light on the pulled pork, but the other meats complimented it well. 

The baked beans were also the best I've ever had. Not too sweet, slightly savory and packed full of smoky flavor. The cole slaw had a nice flavor to it and was a bit tangy for my taste. The garlic mashed potatoes were just as good as any I've had at a 4-5 star restaurant. Now, on to the burnt ends. OMG, they were amazing. My wife ordered them and the portion size was so big we packed up her leftovers to go. The flavor was rich and smoky with just the right meat to fat ratio. 

Overall, we really like Frasher's and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of its BBQ. We will definitely need to make another trip to Phoenix to get the opportunity to visit Frasher's again."}
{"text":"Average at best. I had to bring a point to the attention of the owner before any action was taken. 

Employees look confused. 

Ordered tri-tip and brisket. Brisket was a good, soft and moist piece from the flat and had good flavor, but hardly any bark. Maybe 5 minutes over cooked. As for the tri-tip, theirs should be called dry-tip. Obviously cooked at high temp for short time, no rendered fat goodness, just giant chewy chunks and ribbons of fat. Someone needs to turn in their BBQ card cause if you can't do a tri then I have absolutely no respect for you. Tri tip is one of the tastiest on the cow, yet this had zero flavor and zero bark.may as well have been a 3 day old leftover from the fridge that you snack on. Mac n cheese was the best part.

Overall I rank Frashers on a Famous Dave's level of BBQ. Definitely not a place you show up early to or stand on line for. Pricing should be 2 dollars less, mine were 1/4 pound each and were $6 sandwiches, not $8 and $9 respectively. Mac side was $3 and should be $2. So, if you're passing by and it looks empty you may want to try for yourself, but I do not recommend. So there you have it folks."}
{"text":"This was the worst Smokehouse/BBQ Food ever made for consumption,I would compare it to food thrown on the floor and then out to the dump perhaps,The server to get our order was very pleasant,Once we got home thats when the sh** hit the fan. $10.00 for a brisket sandwich that had a soggy bun and no sauce on it.The turkey was pure sh**.it was dry and the slices even looked pathetic. The Tri Tip was hard as little rocks on a hamburger bun.We were supposed to get beans as a side and we wound up with chili that had jalapeno,s.The corn was so bad that no one could even swallow it down, I wouldn't give that to prisoners in Sheriff Joe,s care. We were very upset and disappointed with Frasher,s. Being from California really makes us miss The Hat in Brea Ca.Now thats a sandwich"}
{"text":"Me and the hubby came in to try this place for the first time.... We were not disappointed.. Friendly and attentive staff. Very clean restaurant and bathrooms. Food was very delicious, ribs and brisket was superb!! Will DEFIANTLY be coming back. Great choice of sides and meats. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Having lived in Kansas City for The Last 5 Years I can tell you this is probably one of the few places in town that serves burnt ends the correct way. The sauce is pretty good the sides are good but what really blows you away besides the burnt ends is the butter cake!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Came out hot and fresh, we got the pulled pork sandwich, rib plate, and the burnt ends sandwich. Whether it's Frashers Steakhouse or Smokehouse you will always be satisfied. Also, It was my moms birthday and they brought her a butter cake with a candle that I thought was pretty sweet of them! :)"}
{"text":"This is a place to go for good BBQ.  From the moment you walk in the decor speaks a place for BBQ.  It has the typical great BBQ places order at the counter and find a seat setup.  The pulled pork looks and tastes great.  It is not the overcooked mush you get at some so called BBQ places.  The smoked turkey is moist, tender and just the right amount of smoke.  The beans are good and the coleslaw is exceptionally done.  It is crisp and well flavored.  The chicken was a bit dry and not much smoke flavor.  It didn't seem to match the rest of the food.  As a strictly personal preference it would have been nice to have pulled chicken and/or maybe the ability to have a hot link along with the meal.  I look forward to returning to try the ribs and some of the other sides.  The turkey gumbo also looked interesting."}
{"text":"Honestly came here because Little Miss BBQ was closed, was a bit wary because the parking lot was pretty empty, but wow! We got the 2 meat combo with burnt ends and brisket with the corn and mac. All the meats were super tender and the price was unbeatable @$15 (especially coming from LA).

Unfortunately I did find a hair in my corn, which would normally cause me to give a 1-star, but the food and service more than made up for it. The worker offered us free pork ribs to try even before I found the hair, AND gave us a complimentary gooey butter cake for the hair mishap. Would definitely come again... Especially for those burnt ends"}
{"text":"We chose Frasher's as runner up after we had a failed attempt trying to go to Little Miss (that place is ALWAYS so dang packed!)

Another AZ BBQ experience in which we realized we are no longer in Tennessee anymore.

Meat was okay.. not the best, but certainly not the worse we've had. The sides though. God bless those sides...

I ordered the turkey sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. The mac n cheese tasted fine, but it was extremely runny and soupy. No thickness to it at all.

My poor fiance ordered their mashed potatoes as a side to the three meat platter. When the plate came out, we thought the mashed potatoes were grits (see attached photo). In addition to their watered down appearance, they were pretty bland and ended up forming a solid mass by the end of our lunch -  we were a bit disappointed. The bbq sauce was okay, but tasted like it came out of a huge tub.

My recommendations: 
In addition to improving the side items, I would highly recommend sweet tea be served, an absolute staple paired with BBQ. We were baffled as to why they were serving some sort of tropical kiwi/watermelon tea by the soda machine at a bbq place."}
{"text":"Omg this place from the start was amazing. I walked in and this amazing smell of barbecue hits me. In my attempt to order I couldn't make up my mind, so I had the order the 3 meat combo, what else is a girl to do. Well it did not disappoint. I went with the ribs, brisket and chicken. The chicken was all but the brisket and ribs were amazing. I did order my food to go but the folks working were very personable, easy going and super approachable. I enjoyed everything about this place. So yum. Need to go back."}
{"text":"I had driven by this restaurant a couple different times and it reminded me of Frasher Steakhouse on Scottsdale Road. Well lo and behold guess what... It was the same George Frasher. I was greatly saddened when they're Steakhouse had closed on Scottsdale Road. So last Saturday we tried the place for lunch. My wife had the brisket and I had the burnt tips. It was pretty good the garlic mashed potatoes are still the bomb. Tonight we went back my wife had a combination platter of brisket and tri-tip and I had a 10 ounce ribeye. Awesome food. I really enjoyed the steak. It was a lot of food we had so I couldn't enjoy the gooey cake but let me tell you that's to die for. Thank you George for another great meal."}
{"text":"Good BBQ!  Confusion over special prices due to new employee is forgivable given the quality of food and sincerity of staff.  Fatty brisket is just that.  Will get lean next time.  Interesting sauces."}
{"text":"I came in with my family on father's day, no wait plenty of room and the food was FANTASTIC. They ran out of the tri tip because of a big party that had come in before us and but the owner saved the night by offering to upgrade to the rib eye no extra charge and the sauce choices they have are amazing. I will be back"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Az! This was my 7th time eating here,
The food is amazing every time! I've tried multiple items, but my favorite is the pulled pork, its hands down the best pulled pork I've ever had. The portions are huge, the meat is slow cooked to perfection. The homemade BBQ sauces are amazing I LOVE the sweet and hot, I mix them both to get a custom blend I love. The sides are to die for, the corn is the best corn I've ever had at any restaurant its so buttery and seasoned perfectly. I enjoy the music and the atmosphere every time. I honestly can't say enough good things about this place! Whatever you do save room for the dessert the homemade gooey butter cake is a slice of heaven! I'll be back to visit soon I get cravings for the pulled pork all the time!! Do yourself a favor and stop in for lunch or dinner ASAP!! You'll be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork burnt ends brisket chicken coleslaw and the best  beans I've ever had going to make me fat I will die happy good but you don't need them gotta come you have missed out and barbecue if you haven't been here."}
{"text":"Came in for Late lunch after my chiro. Absolutely amazing had the brisket enjoyed it with their tangy bbq sauce. Corn bread is delish. Thanks Pete for making this Birthday girl feel extra special."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for BBQ this will not disappoint! 

Came here tonight with the family. Can't go wrong with:
- baby back ribs
- green chile Mac n' cheese (not spicy if u were worried)
- corn bread
- gooey butter cake! Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"We've passed by a few times and kept saying we would have to try it. We were in the neighborhood and decided to stop. I was not disappointed. I got the ribs. They were tender and smokey. My husband got the three meat platter with pulled pork, brisket, and tri tips. All were excellent as well. We had our choice of sides and I ordered the day's special, pan fried spinach. They should consider adding this as a regular menu item, I loved it. We also ordered a cup of the turkey gumbo. It was good, but I'm from New Orleans so the bar for gumbo is high. It was a little pricey for lunch,  but we would go back."}
{"text":"First time in today, I really like the looks and feels of the restaurant.  Old blues playing in the back ground is a real cool touch while earing awesome food. I had the gumbo which was as good as I have ever had. Everything seems to be on point, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Great food and good service! I ordered the pulled pork and brisket platter with mac n' cheese and coleslaw on the side. Everything was yummy! I liked the sweet BBQ sauce the best. The Tennessee sauce was a close second."}
{"text":"Everything I had was amazing. The smoked turkey was the best I've ever had. I even bought a pound to put in my sandwiches for the following week. Glad that I stopped in the service was fast and friendly too. Don't forget to try the Ooey Gooey Butter Cake!!!"}
{"text":"Despite having wanted to try Frasher's for a long time (and I'm talking since it was a steakhouse in Scottsdale), I only finally made it to the smokehouse a couple months ago. I got in there super close to closing time and got my order to go. Unfortunately, they were out of a bunch of stuff (that's the way it goes when you get there late), but they made up for it by loading my bag with goodies to try...for free! What awesome people! We ordered ribs and gumbo and mac and cheese.....the ribs were awesome, the gumbo was so so, the mac was tasty. They gave us coleslaw, cornbread, and beans....so glad they did....the cornbread was incredible! Dangerously good. Diet destroyingly good. The beans were also fabulous. These would be must orders in the future. The prices here are very reasonable. I would 100% recommend Frasher's for your BBQ needs AND I need to return soon to try their mashed potatoes (and for mooooore coooornbread!)."}
{"text":"We moved to the neighborhood last week and wanted to find a good BBQ place.  Decided to stop here for dinner and we were pleasantly surprised.  The Smoked Turkey Gumbo was awesome.  The BBQ Chicken was great and we enjoyed the Green Chili Macaroni & Cheese.  The owner, George is a nice guy.  The Gooey Hot Butter Cake was very good.  We will definitely return so we can try their other meats."}
{"text":"Soooo good here. Went during lunch and there were a lot of people (cause the food is amazing). Def recommend!"}
{"text":"I walked in to Frasher's really thinking I was going to love my meal. I love their old restaurant and I love good BBQ so why wouldn't I love this place? Right?!

When we placed our order I was happy to see that they had all of their meats in stock (the first time we came they were sold out of nearly everything so we left and decided to try another day- this was our re-do) We ordered the rib tip special with corn and the tri tip with fries plus a soda and a beer- the total came out to $45 which seemed a little bit on the high side for what we had ordered.

The food was fresh and hot when we got it and smelled great. The good- the fries and corn were extremely tasty. The less good- both the rib tips and brisket seemed kind of dry and flavorless. 

The true test for me is whether or not I am excited to eat my leftovers the next day for lunch and I hate to say it but I have already made other lunch plans because I have no interest in re-visiting last night's leftovers today.

I hope to come back and have a better experience. I will update my review if I do."}
{"text":"Clean. Very friendly, considerate, and attentive staff and manager. Great flavors and big portions. This is definitely my new rib spot."}
{"text":"I drive by this establishment often and have been wanting to stop in every since I saw it open months ago. I'm glad I finally did the other night while looking for a place for a quick bite with my mom. The first thing I noticed about Frasher's was just how friendly everyone was - from the man out front out held the door open and greeted us to the girl who took our orders to the guy who brought out our food - everyone seemed genuinely happy and that really makes a world of difference in your dining experience. 

Much like many other smokehouse or BBQ places, this is your counter-ordering and then open seating experience. The décor is inviting with a large patio out front which is exactly where we landed on this lovely spring/winter night. We ordered the burnt ends sandwich with no bun and the chicken with no bun along with the green chili mac and the mashed potatoes to share. We also got a slice of the butter cake to split as well. 

The food came out very quickly, was hot and was reasonably portioned. I thought the sides were a little small, but that could be just how they presented them in a tiny little stryofoam cups on the plates. The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth good and I seriously could go back just for that again and again. The burnt ends were decent, I've had much better but they did not disappoint me in any way - just not the best version of a product that I'm a HUGE fan of. The slice of cake was small but it was the perfect size because of how rich it was - tasted just like Christmas butter cookies that we make every year. A great treat for the end of a nice meal. I might just have to stop by for a to-go order tonight, really good experience."}
{"text":"Great set up, walk in and order, pick out a table and the hot food arrives in minutes.  The meat couldn't have been any more tender and the dessert cake was warm and sweet."}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL. I was a regular at the old Frashier's spot and have been looking forward to trying the smokehouse. Incredible experience the minute we walked in. Love the ambiance and I was so happy to see the Gooey Buttercake still on the menu. I ordered the Turkey sandwich and my boyfriend had the Brisket. The meat was so tender and juicy and the BBQ sauce was some of the best I've had in AZ. The french fries came out hot and perfectly crispy!!! Looking forward to coming back. OH, And the gooey buttercake is just as amazing as I remembered. Impeccable customer service."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to love this place since its in my neighborhood.  I am a HUGE mac and cheese fan, and was even more excited that it had green chili.  However, their cheese sauce is totally bland and the pasta was overlooked and mushy.
The smoked meats were just ok.  I LOVE pulled pork, but this one was particularly greasy.  I like Joe's BBQ version a lot better.
I may try it again just to see, but it wasn't \"cravable.\"
The setting is really charming though and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I totally spaced on writing my review for this place. We've been here a few times, and my husband and I love this place!!!!!!!!!!! It is so good, and you cant really go wrong with anything on the menu. The staff is so nice and respectful. I absolutely hate staff who bother you every 5 mins while you're eating. The bbq is worth the drive to us, and we will definitely be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They have the best BBQ I have tasted in the valley and the staff is amazing.  They are super friendly,  fast, and the food, I mean ALL the food is fantastic. They gave us free dessert and soda on our first visit. I love BBQ and am blesses to live down the street."}
{"text":"If 3.5 was an option I would've done it. If I'm near home and craving ribs hands down this will be my spot. I wish I had better way to describe my feeling of e
\"ehhh\" regarding the brisket and pulled pork. They were cooked just right not dry or overcooked not super moist and juicy either. I think what was lacking was bbq seasoning. Some spots put out quality product where you dont even wanna dip it q. This wasn't there but..the sauces were good. I got the three meat platter with my sides being Mac cheese and I think the second was coleslaw. Mac cheese was green chili Mac cheese and not bad but kitchen 56 has set the bar for green chili Mac cheese. I liked the spicy and Reg bbq sauce..didnt love the Tennessee style. They do have a bar no draft beer but decent selection and surprisingly a few house cocktails. Definitely different crowd than when it was chuys. Modernized clean nice cool rustic feel. You order at register and they bring food out. I think it has potential I'm just not in love yet. The ribs have my attn though"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place I saw the good reviews. I must have come on an off day. I kinda wanna give 2 stars but there are a few things that were good. The beans are amazing the ribs are good. Pulled pork is tasteless can't even make it better with sauce. It's oddly watery in my mouth. The brisket was room temperature and each peace of slippery meat was separated by thick firm fat that reminded me head cheese. The mac and cheese was so bland I wanted to cry. The toast they gave with the platter was crispy but drenched in butter. Corn bread was good. Sauce is alright my favorite was the one in the middle I think it said Tennessee on it. The mashed potatoes are dry bland and tasteless and didn't come with gravy. I can't imagine how this would all taste if I wasnt absolutly starving after working 10 hours. I saw the owner or manager from across the room he seems nice. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"We just moved to Phoenix from Utah and noticed this BBQ when driving by. We decided to stop in and were so happy we did!

We were there at an odd hour - around 3:30, so there was just us and some people who popped in around 4. We talked with the manager (maybe owner??) who was very helpful and guided us through the menu options. 

I decided on the rips, corn and coleslaw and my husband got the pulled pork, broccoli and jalapeno mac and cheese. 

OMG! The food was AMAZING!! I got the 6 rib plate which was way to much for me, so thankfully we had leftovers. You can tell the care that they put into smoking and preparing the meat. It was so delicious, falling off the rips and the cuts were rather lean for ribs. There was a lot of meat on there!

The BBQ sauces they had are house-made and spectacular. I love that they are home-made and don't have MSG or high-fructose corn syrup. The variety of flavors was great too. 

One thing I highly recommend getting is the corn. I don't know exactly how they make it, but it was delicious. The cole-slaw isn't loaded with mayonnaise so we all enjoyed it. 

This is definitely our new favorite BBQ place. The service and food were both worthy of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I like Frazier BBQ. It's cannot compare with the BBQ I use too from KC. The restaurant is vey nice and clan. I e had the brisket, burnt ends and ribs. All are very good. I really like the Mac and cheese. It's spicy.  The service is very good and the prices are good. This is one of the best BBQ's I had in Arizona."}
{"text":"My 10 year old loves BBQ so we stopped in. Good lean pulled pork and brisket. The sides were noteworthy, excellent mashed potatoes and green chili mac n cheese. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Order at the counter and they bring the food out to you.

Shared the 1/2 beef brisket,  1/2 lb pulled pork, baby back ribs, Corn and jalapeño mac and cheese.

The brisket is good, but does not stand out, the pulled pork is a better choice and the baby back ribs are a keeper. 

There are alot of great bbq places in Phoenix and this is not one of them.

Would rather spend my money at a couple other bbq places"}
{"text":"I am one that really enjoys a good BBQ, and I found it here. Though this is a little drive for us, it was recommended and we took the trip. It was well worth it! We were there for lunch on Sunday and I had the competition style ribs (available Sundays only). The meat was falling off the bone. The flavor was excellent. I am one that likes to use a lot of BBQ sauce, but not on these ribs! I ate these without the sauce as the taste was Phenomenal. My wife had the 2 meat plate with pulled pork and tri-tip, both were very good as I, of course, had to try them both! Our friends had the baby back ribs and told us they will definitely be going back as they live much closer than we do.

I do have one suggestion for the management, maybe consider putting in fans or ceiling fans on the patio as it was a beautiful day out and we did sit there, but the fly's were getting a little annoying. Fans will help to keep them away.

For anyone that enjoys a good barbeque and do not want to pay very high prices, this is the place to try,"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ. The food was a great price and hefty portions. Loved that you can get the gooey butter cake that was served at the old restaurant."}
