{"text":"We went here one time and that will probably be it. The staff was nice and very accommodating, no problem there except all were wearing a hodgepodge of mismatched uniforms and very sloppily dressed. I usually don't take much notice of that but here, that really stood out. The food: my wife had the pesto and it tasted fine, just that there was a huge amount of oil that had separated from the sauce and laying at the bottom of the dish. Very unappealing!  I had their meatball sub and was hugely disappointed. The meatballs were OK, but what threw me was that their signature item was served on a food lion crap quality hogie roll for ...get this $10.00. Are you kidding me? They actually had a nice artisan style baguette that came with the pasta entree. Why the meatball sub wasn't served on that I can't figure. This place left me scratching my head about a theme. Cool place, nice older home converted into a restaurant, entree's served as you would expect on ceramic dishware but drinks are served in styrofoam cups???? Seriously?? This place left me scratching my head!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Meatballs on Main on Monday for lunch. It was our first time here. 
My wife does not each cheese and we could not find anything on the menu with no cheese. The menu was very limited, but we settled on trying 2 different burgers.  The buns and fries were good, the slaw was excellent  but the burger patties were highly overcooked, almost tough. The service was OK. We will not be coming back as there was nothing really special about this place. If you like the old houses, meatballs and a lot of cheese this place might be just what you were looking for."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the portions were just right! I got the cluck cluck meatballs with bbq sauce atop mashed potatoes and my husband got beef meatballs with marinara sauce atop fresh cut fries! The restaurant is inside a quaint older house which offers a nice cozy feel! Definitely worth checking out!! It's unique, charming and delicious! :-)"}
{"text":"My wife and I purchased a Groupon to try this restaurant for the first time.  We were really excited about the opportunity to enjoy a good old fashion meatball.  First of all, I think their pricing is HIGH for the portion you receive.  The wait time was long.  Over 30 minutes to receive our food.  My wife's sandwich had 3 meatballs in it and one of them was burnt.  We still have another groupon to use, I may try and sell it :-)  We would NEVER return and pay regular price, but may go back with coupon or for a special to try something else on menu."}
{"text":"I also waited each day for this restaurant to open with visions of yummy sauces and homestyle meatballs.  Maybe I over thought it or envisioned it.  You are great by waiters that are in yellow tee shirts (generally wrinkled and unkempt).  You are lead to a table and given wrapped silverware and served your drinks in a disposable cup, then served on glass.  But I jump ahead.  The menu in photo copied on a half sheet that has been cut to save money-the other half of the menu is the wine menu.  I was afraid to see if the wine came in plastic.  The menu is very limited and over priced for the amounts of food you receive.  We went with the smaller meatball sandwiches-3 in total-like sliders- when the sliders came the bread was as hard as a rock.  The meatball on each sandwich look like it had been smashed on the rock bread and a half of teaspoon of the sauce put on the meatball smash.  We order a salad with the sliders-thinking we would get a salad.  As we waited for the salad (which came on the plate we discovered)-it was a few pieces of lettuce with 3 pieces of spinach and a teaspoon of tomato chopped on top.  The dressing were so limited.  I asked the waiter what Green Goddess was (I had not heard of it since I was younger) he said parsley and some other stuff-wasn't sure. It had no taste.  The sauces on the meatball smash had no flavor.  The only flavor we got was hot when we ordered the hand cut fries with can with a seasoned ketchup (hot seasoned).  The fries totaled less than a half of handful at a cost of $4.00 a side.  They were delicious, but their could not have been more than 20-25 shoe string fries on the little side plate.  With the fries and two slider plates and two iced teas we spent nearly $40.00-a non value not well spent.  Even if the waiter had come back and filled our drinks or ask us how everything was or the staff did not stand in the lobby laughing and joking during the dinner.  We could have looked over the fact that this is a restaurant that just does not know what they want to be fast food, sit down or a high end meatball \"joint\"  It is not of the above.  Run don't walk away from Meatballs on Main."}
{"text":"Went over on 4/9/2013 at 7pm and discovered they were out of business! Never had a chance to try. I guess they have been struggling for awhile and tried reducing overall menu offerings but it didn't help. Their sign has been taken down and notices are on the front doors."}
{"text":"We went there on a recent Friday night, which seemed to be an \"off\" night for them. The place was packed, there were seemingly only  2 servers, and they were in the weeds.

We had the Old School meatballs with Marinara and the vegetarian meatballs with a spicy sauce, both over pasta. They were good but not memorable. What WAS memorable was the $40+ bill for them & 2 sodas in styrofoam cups (yuck)! Crazy prices for what you get-- and we had an hour and a half wait after we sat down to even get our meals. They ran out of dessert (there's only one on the menu) before 8PM; the whole evening was out of synch with different servers coming by with incorrect orders, etc.

To make up for it we went out for Vietnamese food the next night and 3 of us had delicious, hearty bowls of pho for $26. Much better."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise ...

While traveling north from our home in Sarasota Florida we decided to stop for lunch. As we often do we look for a unique stop in a small town . We decided on Davidson North Carolina as it was near our route north on Interstate 77. We found this charming place called \"Meatballs on Main\" right outside Davidson. What a pleasant surprise .....

We ate on the front wraparound porch on a lovely afternoon in late September.

The menu consisted of different kinds of meatballs, sauces and bases. I had the Hog Wild meatballs with Whisky Bar B Que sauce over mashed potatoes. Really something different and original. Food was excellent and the prices were reasonable for how big the portions were. Service was good and I thought the iPods they used for order taking were neat. Atmosphere inside was \"old fashioned victorian\" and is located in a restored older home. If in the area give it a try ..."}
{"text":"Meatballs on Main is located in a cute little house on Main Street in Cornelius, I drive by here every day on my way to and from work and I was excited to try out the place when it opened.  

I tried out Meatballs on Main the second day it had open and in an afterthought, I'm thinking maybe I should have waited until they were open for a little while.  The meatballs I got were very good, they were the Cluck-Cluck meatballs in Mushroom Gravy (so good!).  The only problem I had was that I got the mini portion, which had 4 meatballs and a focaccia breadstick, the breadstick was rock hard.  I am not a picky eater so if the breadstick would have been a bit hard, I wouldn't have complained, I would have dipped it in the sauce and chewed it up the best I could.  But this breadstick was unbreakable, I feel like my teeth would break before the breadstick.  I asked the waitress if I could get another breadstick and she went back to the kitchen and came back saying that they are having problems with the bread so all the breadsticks are that way.  I thought to myself... why are you serving these if they are all this way.. They offered no other alternative to the breadstick so I just had my meatballs and that was it.

As far as their menu was concerned I wasn't too impressed, in newspaper articles they made it seem like there were going to be all these unconventional sauces.  They do have 7 different sauces but 5 of the 7 aren't that out of the ordinary.  All their servers have nifty little phones that they take your order on but... be patient because it seems like they are just getting a handle on the software so it takes them about 5 minutes to enter your order.  This all gives me the impression they just threw together a menu and didn't properly train their servers just so they could open as soon as possible.

To sum everything up.. I'm going to try the place again a few months from now and hopefully by then they will have all the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"Disgusting! I'm a huge meatball fan, and while the meatballs themselves were decent, the atmosphere and other foods were terrible. I ordered the pesto sauce and it was - frozen! Yes, parts of my dish were actually ice cold. I couldn't finish it. I'm also a huge bread fan, and the \"baquette\" I got with my meal was cold, squishy, and tasted exactly the same as a hot dog roll. Again, I couldn't eat it. I'm really not that picky, but I left extremely disappointed and still hungry. The atmosphere from the outside is cute. But inside, you get styrofoam cups, cheap tables/seats, and staff that doesn't even try to dress nice. Not impressed...beware of this place!"}
{"text":"If the name of your restaurant has \"meatballs\" in it, you better have the best meatballs around, and they do not. I didn't taste much meat. The spaghetti was overcooked and sticky and the pesto sauce was dry. On the good side, the bread and garlic and goat cheese appetizer was very good. Service was decent, but atmosphere was \"uncomfortable\"."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and fresh. They have homemade meatballs but recently added burgers and gooey grilled cheese. It's like eating at your Granny's house. The salads are crisp and white beans are (one of many) a choice in lieu of fries for a side. My kids love putting together a dinner that is combined just for them. My husband always orders the stuffed burger and I have white beans with a veggie meatball and pesto, which doesn't taste healthy just scrumptious."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a meatball restaurant, then this is your place. The decor and facilities could use some polish, but it also adds to the charm."}
{"text":"They were open on New Year's Day, and I had already tried three or four other places that ended up being closed for the holiday.  I wasn't too hungry, so I got \"baked spinach\" from a part of the menu labeled \"from the oven\", described on the menu being made with breadcrumbs.  I'm thinking it'll be 2-3 inches high, substantial, but it ended up being pretty much just spinach with a little cheese on top -- basically just a side dish, nowhere near an entree (I went directly to Cook House afterwards, for a gyro).  Almost $10, including a drink, tax, and tip.  I don't see any reason to go back.  It's in the same location as the Tea House of a few years ago, and it still has the same cute decor inside and out.  I miss that place."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed until a friend suggested we have dinner here.  Pulling in I was immediately intrigued at the historical house tuned restaurant. We were greeted by friendly staff and showed to our table. The restaurant was fairly empty for a Wednesday night and the playlist was quite random varying between country and class rock... But made for interesting dinner conversation while we waited. Our server was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, offering suggestions for us first timers. This place was one of the few restaurants I've actually been to that server takes your dinner order on their iPhone...pretty cool. Their specialty is their meatballs (veggie option as well) which you can get any way you can possibly imagine and offering a variety of sauces. I ended up getting going with a classic (though was tempted to try something new) and ended up choosing the veggie meatball sub. I loved the sauce!! You can definitely tell they use high quality fresh tomatoes!! I tried my husband's meat version of the same and mine was just as good! I'll be back at some point to try something new...."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I've been here twice and really enjoyed the food, but the restaurant itself gives off a vibe like it doesn't really know what it wants to be.  

On one hand, you have a quirky menu with several great meatball choices.  But the subdued decor of the dining room and their wait staff don't seem to match what they are going for.  (Anyone who has been to Bad Daddy's can understand the importance of these elements to their success.)  On my second visit, they had great rock music playing, but the CD kept skipping, and we had to say something before they did anything about it.  

Another thing that bothered me was that they served our water in styrofoam cups, when everything else was served on dishes (and with real silverware).  It cheapened the dining experience somewhat.

But the food is what really stands out at Meatballs on Main.  The first time, I went sans hubby, and had their special, a Greek lamb/beef meatball topped with tzatziki sauce, and served with pita wedges and fingerling potatoes.  It was a good sized bowl with four meatballs @ $10.  (Alternatively, I could have gotten this dish for $8 without the potatoes.)  The sauce was a wonderful complement to their awesome meatballs.

The second time, I tried one of their menu items, the Cluck Cluck chicken meatball with mushroom gravy and macaroni noodles.  I really loved this meatball with the sauce - it was incredibly flavorful!  My hubby had the Here's the Beef meatball with the spicy meat sauce and macaroni.  The sauce was definitely spicy and very good.  (He also had the beet salad and loved it, but he thought the portion could be halved for a lower price.)

I hope more people give MoM a try, because the food really is good.  I also hope they jazz up the decor and work out some of the new restaurant kinks so they can stay in business for a long time."}
{"text":"4.5 stars: new menu (GREAT cheeseburgers and fries) now with fewer meatball options but the same sauces and carb (fries, mashed potatoes, white beans, pasta), friendly new staff, love the sweet tea, and now open on Sundays so we go can there after church!! Meatballs on Main is the new Sunday post-church tradition for my family. Look forward to it each weekend!"}
