{"text":"Love Joe boos obviously the chicken wing the only half decent kosher ones in Toronto. Their smoked meat sandwich is mouth watering. The service is on par with all other Jewish establishments.
The optimal time to go there is lunch were the staff is a lot more attentive. The food is 5 stars but because of the service it is knocked down one all in all great experience and have been and will continue to be a regular."}
{"text":"We've only gotten takeout from here so I can only speak to the takeout side. The food is really good and the service is pretty quick. I've had the steak sandwich and it was really fantastic. They also have some great prepared food section. The burgers were pretty bad but that's just one menu item of numerous that are great. 

The only thing is you need to double check your takeout orders as they ALWAYS make a mistake. Otherwise totally check it out!"}
{"text":"The chicken I have had at this place has been fantastic! It can be a little pricey, but it is worth it. This is a COR Glatt Kosher meat restaurant. 

I knew of Cookoos for years, but never went inside. Something about it never appealed to me. Then, the TV show 'Restaurant Makeover' did an episode there. They remolded the entire place, including a new sign and logo. It was because of the show that we gave the place a try...

Cookoos specializes in slow roasted chicken. That is their signature dish, as it obvious from the floor to ceiling wood burning fireplace, in which the chicken is roasted.

The first time we visited Cookoos, we ordered a whole chicken with steamed veggies and potato wedges. The mouth watering chicken was dripping in natural flavour. My wife and I agreed it was love at first bite. We order the same thing every time we go there :)

The menu also offers burgers, wraps and a few Chinese dishes. I have been told they now have shwarma, too."}
{"text":"This is a Jewish restaurant that serves kosher food and is Very over priced for the amount of food you receive. If you do not require kosher diet than I would suggest dining elsewhere for better value. The meal itself was not very flavourful, the chicken was dry from being under heat for a while and quite bland."}
{"text":"5 star review for the BBQ chicken. It was delicious and I loved the BBQ sauce that is served with it. Hot table they have is average as many of the items I have tried on it were nothing special. Love the whole BBQ chicken. Maybe they should add BBQ ribs to the menu - Mazel tov to that idea!"}
{"text":"I like Joe Boo's. I feel though sometimes it's hit or miss with them.  I find during the day is better quality service.  The burger specials are great, you get a lot for your money. The chicken wings are excellent.  

I placed a large order once for my family, and they forgot the burger in my son's sandwich (there was just a bun with toppings). I mentioned it the next time I was in and they replaced the missing item.

I find though sometimes the sandwich is sloppily made with WAY too much condiments to the point where its soggy and falls apart. I find this seems to happen more at night vs. the day. (I guess it depends on whose working)

Over all pretty good place to eat. A bit on the expensive side though."}
{"text":"If I'm going to Joe Boo's for something, you can easily bet I'm going to chicken wings. Of all the kosher places in Toronto, this is the place that seems to get the chicken wing right. It's crispy and the sauce to wing ratio is good too.

That ends the positive portion of this review. 

Now on to the cons. My biggest issue with Joe Boos has been the fluctuation in price for wings. For 2 pounds (That's right my unkosher consuming friends, 2 pounds) I've paid between $17 and $21 ever since I've been going there. Now it could just be a complete oversight by a recently hired employee or it could be company policy to be confusing to customers. But I've had issues with pricing of food there in the past so I really don't know what to fully think. For what it is though, the wings I order are worth the money in comparison to other kosher alternatives in Toronto.

The sauces available are (that I'm aware of):

Honey Garlic, Mild, Medium, and Hot.

In reality it is:

Honey Garlic, Ketchup with a bit of Hot Sauce, Ketchup with a bit more Hot Sauce, and Ketchup with a lot of Hot Sauce.

I'd talk about more what they offer there and of what of that list I have eaten, but when I wen't to their website and clicked on Menu, it pulled up direction on how to get there. Not really a Menu and not really what I was looking for.....

I've heard stories of poor customer service there as well (ie server forgetting to sauce wings and such) but that goes with any restaurant and that type of stuff happens. The food makes up for the lack of creativity and service at this place and I'm not saying don't go there. The food is worth it to check out. I just tend to stagger the times I go there for a meal."}
{"text":"Went to this place based purely on reviews via Yelp. 

Pretty disappointed as we ordered chicken, fries, veggies and a hamburger. 

The chicken was dry and not tasty at all. Fries and veggies were fine but cold. Hamburger was actually decent. 

Won't go again. Not sure if it was an off day or what."}
{"text":"Looking for a kosher burger? This is the place in town to get it. 
I usually order the Double Burger, and it's consistently hot, big and juicy. Compared to other places in town, the meat is better (all cooked on a wood fire) and the price is just right. The service is also great, but the only issue I have is the cleanliness (which seems to be an issue with kosher establishments in general). The tables are always sticky and full of crumbs, so consider taking your burger to-go."}
