{"text":"Enticed by a coupon for the \"grand\" buffet brunch. Not impressed, far overpriced for what's offered, even with a coupon."}
{"text":"Note to self:  don't order the room service.  Maybe they handle your food differently in the restaurant, but the \"dinner rolls\" were warmed in the oven in a sad attempt to his the fact that they were stale.  And here's another tip:  if you're going to charge $12 for a salad maybe use something a little better than iceberg lettuce."}
{"text":"Visited PJ's tonight to try something new in our neighborhood.   Not impressed.   The food was way overpriced and average at best."}
{"text":"Had a free beer thanks to a Yelp coupon. Was here on business and was able to sit at the bar, watch a game, and do some work on my computer. The bar tender was friendly. Not bad for a hotel."}
{"text":"Despite its convenient location less than three miles from our home, my wife and I had not dined at the Fort Couch Road Crowne Plaza Hotel for years because we had found the food to be consistently mediocre.  My advice to anyone considering the spot is that you not waste your money.  You would do better to go to Eat 'n Park, whose reasonably priced Sunday brunch is good by comparison.

The hotel has the chutzpah to call the Sunday brunch \"grand\".  The only facet of it which is grand is the price, $16.95. It is a spartan selection of mediocre, processed food.

The carving station consisted of one meat: ham. The items at the buffet station were creamed chipped beef, scrambled eggs, waffles, quiche with spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes, oatmeal, bacon, sausage, an omelette station, hash browned potatoes whose main ingredient was salt, bagels, sliced breads, danish and other breakfast sweets, and cherry cobbler.  The one dish that had great appeal at first glance was a mixture of sliced strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries, but the fruit medley was warm, apparently intended only as a topping for waffles.  There was no salad of any kind and no green vegetable offered, a rarity for a Sunday brunch buffet.

We received reasonably attentive service from a gracious and pleasant server.

When we departed at 11:30, which should be a busy time for a fine hotel's brunch, there was only one party of two left.  It is easy to see why that is the case.

This is an attractive, comfortable restaurant into which the management/ownership has obviously invested a great deal.  It would be the perfect place for a fine dining experience at this, Holiday Inn's \"high end\" Crowne Plaza division.  It is a shame that a restaurant located in an affluent area is being wasted.  I am thankful that there are many fine dining spots nearby."}
{"text":"This place has pretty decent food and a really nice inside decor.  The bar especially looked nice.  Like I said, the food was just kinda alright.  I got some sort of herbed chicken, which after I scraped the herbed dusting off, there I was left with a tiny tiny peice of chicken.  The sides of green beans were pretty small too.  I understand it is a pre-dinner discount menu item, but the fact that it was not too filling makes it not much of a special deal.  Drinks were kinda weak too."}
