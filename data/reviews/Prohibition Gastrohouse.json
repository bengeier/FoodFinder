{"text":"Everyone was raving about Prohibition and I finally had a chance to find out why!  Loved the food, atmosphere was very cool, service was flawless!  This place is a little out of my way but so worth the drive.  See you there!"}
{"text":"We just keep coming back this cozy joint. Great food - love the quesadillas with pulled pork - and a good beer list. I love a restaurant that delivers consistently.  I'd like to see some periodic menu change to give a little more selection on our return visits. If that happens it would be great to see a few smaller plates.  Solid choice."}
{"text":"Between lunches, dinners, and drinks over the last three years, being charged $5 cover for the privilege of being a male, with the reason from the hostess being \"My manager told me to,\" is too arbitrary for me to tolerate.  After two minutes waiting for female company to cost-check, listening to their shitty Sat. night DJ and watching several televisions spread through the environment, I apologized to my company for having to leave, and asked the hostess if I could have my cover back. Naturally the fairer sex forwarded me to buff security, who refused, without reason, to return my cover, saying \"It wasn't possible.\"  This experience demonstrates how lucrative the meat market has always been, I suppose, and how unwelcome a regular (several times monthly) customer becomes when Dr. Jeckyl becomes Mr Hyde. All the good food does nothing to recommend a place like this to me."}
{"text":"Really like to food. Soooo too bad about the bad service.   Came for brunch today. Ordered the duck benny and french toast and a side of DF tater tots (wanted to give them a try). When ordering the waitress asked if i wanted the side dip for the tots, but forgot to mention it was $2. All the food came together- lovely and hot. Had to call or track down the waitress for everything I needed. More water, salt, sugar, etc. When the bill came  i saw i was charged $10 for the appetizer portion. So my $5 side, just became $12. And really, again, no biggie. But when I asked the waitress about it \"oh, I ordered the side\" (and we didn't even finish them), she said sorry, I thought you ordered the app. Although, it didn't come as an app.  If a food item is listed in 2 places on the menu  at 2 different price points, the waitress should clarify.   The correct response should have been to say, \"oops, my mistake, let me change that for you.\" But instead, she said sorry a few times and made my feel like it was my mistake. I assumed in a local place like this, folks would be trained in the customer-is-always-right motto. It also would have been nice to have been checked in with at least once through out the meal. Was hoping I just got the wrong server, but the bad service reputation was confirmed with a few other friends' experience. Such a bummer.   Hope they get a handle on this because the food was great, but service is why people return places."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite gastro-pubs around.  Great selection of beer and drinks, a daily drink special, and fantastic food - their grilled cheese sandwich with pulled pork keeps me coming back.  Also, love the oysters!"}
{"text":"Had very high expectations when we went there. Unfortunately weren't satisfied at all. Salad was very plain, the chicken super dry and the ribs not even worth mentioning it. We were very disappointed and let our waiter know about it. He waived a few drinks off the bill which was nice. But still, wouldn't go back there again. There's too many good restaurants in TO and this was definitely the worst I've visited so far."}
{"text":"This place has the best mac n cheese I've ever had. It's a good place for a casual night of drinking and eating pub food. They have really good happy hours every day. Good for a small group or a large group. If you are planning a party of more than 10 people, make sure to book weeks in advance if it's during a weekend as they are get fully booked for large groups very quickly."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my family. The food was delicious and really surpassed my expectations. I had the \"wet burrito\" which although poorly named, was excellent! Everyone else in our party of 6 loved their meals. Our only complaint was that the coffee wasn't good, which is important to us when we go out to dine in the morning. Also, the place was very family friendly, without being cheesy."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mac and Cheese in the city....which I stupidly did not order so I had to teef it off my friends plate.  I had the nicoise salad which was also absolutely delicious.  Tuna: perfect.  Dressing: zesty.  It really was a perfect salad.    I notice a lot of bellyaching on here about the lack of vegetarian options.  I have said it here on yelp before and I will say it again:  No Chef gets a hard-on over vegetarian cooking unless they are the owners of vegan/vegetarian restaurants.  It is hardly surprising that a place called PROHIBITION doesn't specialize in vegan fare.    They got us out of there in less than an hour (we had a show to go to) which is impressive on a Friday night in Toronto.  I will have to go back to try something more substantial than a salad."}
{"text":"I had my birthday celebration here just over 2 weeks ago on June 17. Booking the table for 20 was a breeze, thanks to Emily who was very prompt and professional. Our server Jesse was great, attentive and somehow managed to keep us all happy. He even offered to keep my presents safe, so we could move the party to the dance floor. Special thanks to the security team who were simply class acts. It was definitely a great night and I'll be happy to come back. Drinks were great, no one in my party complained about their meals and we all had a blast. It would be 5 stars, except for the surly DJ."}
{"text":"It's inconsistent. Quality seems to have gone down and it remains very pricey for the most part. Sad, since the place is cool, relaxed and friendly. During our last visit, our waiter was really nice and attentive. Unfortunately, we were disappointed by the food. Two oysters (out of twelve) were not fresh (kitchen staff, please smell oysters before serving. It gives you big hints about freshness). The pico de gallo was soggy. The tomatoes looked like they had been cut a long time ahead. The biscuit accompanying the soup was delicious. The cocktail was fabulous but when you pay over $14, you don't want the glass  entirely filled with ice cubes."}
{"text":"Was out on a Saturday night with my wife, long week so we decided to go watch a movie in the Yonge and Eglinton area. Wanted to eat first, I noticed last time I seen it , it was a Boston Pizza and now it's Prohibition Gastrohouse. I've been to the one on Queen and Broadview many times and was like great something decent since area doesn't has to many good choices.  Walked in and working in the industry for as many years as I've had I can tell they were in the weeds and looked like a shit show. I didn't want to assume, looks can be deceiving so waited for host, when she arrived she gave us few choice also letting us know there is a DJ tonight in back. We decided to sit in the back lounge bar area. Was packed at all. We must have waited 15 mins and no one said a word to us, I was really shocked, I think she was a manager short girl looked young I could only assume cause she had a ring of keys on her wrists. How my night turned out , I eating at Pickle Barrel we didn't even get a hello someone will be right with you or get us drinks..... If you come to my restaurant in the financial district this would never happen someone would be fired \"Grand Opening many Grand closing\" I know a lot of concepts failed in that location and they not off to a good start. Thanks we are late for our movie now!!"}
{"text":"I came here couple times. Price is good and awesome energy here. Friendly staffs and love lollipop chicken and poutine."}
{"text":"Indifferent, impersonable 'service' - not even as much as eye contact from the bartender / server, on a fairly quiet Sunday night, and not even a smile from either of two of them.   Why not?  We always try to make sure that we are 'warm and friendly' guests, so . . . WTF?  Are you kidding me???? If you want them / Prohibition  to take your money, go there, but don't expect any 'hospitality'. All we expect is a smile, and you get 20%, for sure - without being effusive or 'ass-kissing'  - just nice, please and thank you. But not at Prohibition. Sorry to say."}
{"text":"The Good -  Half Price Beer and Mixed Drinks from 3:30-6pm every week day.  How can you go wrong with $3.00 bottle of Heineken? The owner,  Michael, very social and makes you feel comfortable as soon as you walk in.  The Bad -  Service...Took me over 10 minutes to get a drink and I was one of 5 customer's in the place.  To make matters worse, the bartender was within 10 feet of me for over 5 minutes!  The Ugly - The bloody bar seats....My god where did you get those things? You need to be on roids in order to move them to a more comfortable position."}
{"text":"Drinks menu and the ambience is really good but service is really poor. We were a group of 5 and we had to clean our own table and get napkins from the counter. I think due to hooch hours when all drinks are $5 from 5pm to 7pm, the service goes way down. Well hope they improve later on."}
{"text":"Good vibes! We went with a bunch of friends for happy hour and dinner on a Friday. Good selection of beers, house red and white was alright. The group ordered lobster mac n cheese, lobster poutine, nachos, guacamole side, deconstructed Ni√ßoise salad, burger, fries, and oysters. The waitress didn't know the oyster menu ended up they only had east coast oysters. Good food and good service. A very mixed crowd, even a family friendly area in the back. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Prohibition Gastrohouse is a great upscale pub.  Service is friendly and quick. The atmosphere is lively.  I've been for dinner, lunch, brunch and late-night drinks.  The place is always packed! There is a a lot of pork on the menu  It's a tiny bit pricy for pub food but I keep on going back cause the food and service are some of the best in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The duck poutine is a religious experience. No other single dish in the entire city of Toronto compares to the sheer decadence and deliciousness of this unless it is their duck eggs Benedict on the brunch menu.  If you find yourself anywhere along Queen East then do yourself a favour and swing by. Even their salads are a thing of beauty."}
{"text":"Just another overpriced chain restaurant (even though it's not a chain). TVs showing sports, greasy food, service is fine. But experience is dime a dozen."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times - Hooch hour ($5 House wines and beers) is worth 3 stars in and of itself.  The menu is limited, and everything has duck fat (which is fine by me.)  You can order things to be made vegetarian though, in most cases.  It's a nice place to go and have a drink, but the menu's predictability makes it somewhere I don't generally go to eat unless I'm taking family out somewhere and want it to be close.  You can only eat Duck Fat fries with gravy so often."}
{"text":"I really do like this place. My buddies and I have come here a couple times and the only negative things I have to say is that they need to get their \"policies\" straight. Called to make a reservation and was told that they werent allowed to be made for weekends, which is fine, lots of places are like that. But when I got there I was told that it would be a 45 minute wait because we didn't make a reservation. When I stated that I was informed there were no reservations permitted on weekends they said \"oh you must have been misinformed\"  Total disappointment."}
{"text":"Amazing!  The gluten free Mac and Cheese was to die for accompanied by a perfectly poured pint! Good service, clean and reasonably priced.  Perhaps a couple of dollars more than pub food but the the quality of food is far superior.  Duck confit, truffle oil and so on.  No frozen foods here.  Overall, money well spent.  I will be coming back for certain....most likely in the next week;)"}
{"text":"I have been to prohibition  on many occasions and usually I woukd say it is reasonable but pretty average in most respects  Recently I was there for a group event (12 or so in our party) the service was laughable. Between the saccharine and endearments.of the server and the ridiculously slow kitchen and bar service... I will not be going back"}
{"text":"Another restaurant/gastro-pub within minutes from my house, Prohibition looks like a sports bar from the outside, but don't be fooled. Their food is pretty great and they play great music. Also have a really extensive beer menu (on tap & by the bottle), wine list as well as an okay cocktail list.  Have been numerous times and have sampled many items on the menu I'll outline my favorites:  - Pulled Pork & Applewood Smoked Cheddar Grilled Cheese: served on sough dough bread, I opted for a side of greens with maple balsamic dressing. Very tasty, super decadent, the pulled pork is an amazing addition   - Buckingham Blanket - a wrap sandwich with rare flank steak, arugula, caramelized onions, wasabi-mayo wrapped in a Yorkshire pudding-like flatbread. This is my favourite item on the menu, like Sunday dinner in a handheld sandwich  -  Chicken Lollipops - frenched Ontario chicken drumsticks. Tasty, their version of chicken wings  - '37 Cobb Salad - I know, who orders a salad in a bar, but as Cobb salads go, this one was perfect! Included pulled chicken, diced tomatoes, huge chunks of blue cheese, bacon, avocado, eggs dressed with a tasty vinegarette  Have also ordered oysters on the half shell, priced at $2 & $3 depending on the type, they were super fresh and briney and came with the typical oyster sides.  Overall, a good spot if you are looking to please everyone in your party."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the fiesta margarita. Only reason it didn't get a 5* is because they sat us by the door which kept opening and letting in a really cold draft, and the tuna app portion size was too small."}
{"text":"I could go into detail about how great the food is, how cheap the hooch hour is, how great the decor is, how great the Friday and Saturday nights are, but to keep it short and sweet, if you can get out here you'll definitely want to go back. Period."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my birthday a week ago on a Saturday night. This place USED to be really good. Waited in line over an hour in the cold while we could see the place wasn't full. We had guest list that wasn't honoured.  Once inside the inside is starting to look worn down, the speaker system was broken down with one of the main speakers crackling all night. Will not be coming back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, reasonably priced drinks and honestly the best gastrohouse poutine ever!  four stars because we had to leave our table so they could move it for the \"club\" portion of the night."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend on Saturday night to grab some grub after a long afternoon of studying. Meh. Nice atmosphere, but the service was lacking and I really didn't like my meal. I had ordered the Redneck Poutine, not expecting taters to mean the kind you get from a McCain's package (they probably weren't but they tasted and looked exactly like them). The meal was so salty, the lamb confit, red wine jus and cheese just added to the heaviness. Perhaps a smaller portion with a side of salad would have helped, but I really think they need to reconceptualize this one. My friend had the Bison Burger, liked it. I don't think I'll be frequenting here again, except perhaps for the beer, which was as standard an offering as they come."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend after a spinning class. Going out for dinner after working out is kind of backwards, isn't it? Oh well, it was definitely worth it in this case!  I loved the food here. We were extremely hungry (from the workout) so we decided to get a few plates and share. My god are the portions insanely large and therefore awesome. We ordered the mac and cheese (with truffle oil!), the bison burger, and frites fried in duck fat with black garlic aioli (we were really trying hard to undo that workout). It was all so delicious. The mac and cheese was so complex tasting because they put all these unusual types of cheeses in the sauce. We were able to order how the bison burger was cooked, which means they ground the meat themselves. Medium rare, and cooked exactly how we asked. The burger was huge, and also delicious. The frites were great. And that black garlic aioli was insanely flavourful. I was left wondering HOW? Great food. Period.  I thought the whole menu looked amazing and it's too bad I wasn't rich and didn't have a pit-less stomach, because I would have liked to try more dishes in that one sitting. There was one thing I noticed on the menu that was a nice touch: they had an option about how you could dress your salad (light, medium, or heavy). A lot of restaurants overdress salads, so it's good they recognize the failings of other restaurants in this area and have come up with a way to prevent it here.  Our server and the other staff were great too. They were very helpful in bringing extra side plates for all the sharing we were doing, and when the people beside us left, our server went ahead and pushed their empty table beside ours so we had tons of room for our huge spread of food. Woot woot.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. Although there were no window seats available (their window seats are in front of huge, huge windows), our seats were still great. We had a view of the TVs and they were playing I Love Lucy, which I thought was a fun, retro touch.   I would definitely come back. We didn't have any drinks, so that is on my to-do list the next time I go back."}
{"text":"We were a group of 10 and service was great! Everyone enjoyed their food. I had the Greek burger and it was delicious! The waiter couldn't quite get the cheese on fire but it was still quite delicious. I would recommend and visit again. Bonus is happy hour from 5-7!"}
{"text":"Nice place on Queen Street East. My first time here with my soccer team wasn't memorable and was pre-yelp (I literally don't remember the experience) but I went back last night and had some tasty food. Their Nacho tray is spectacular with some nice side dips including egg plant. I also had the 1/2 order of Mac and Cheese which was tasty and enough food after sharing the plate of nachos with 4 people. Service was excellent. They have a neat service switch you can flick on in the booth if you need service. However we didn't even use it as the service was excellent. The menu in general is slightly pricey but I did quite well on 25 dollars including tax and tip"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that rubs your insides with loving indulgence. Order a pint, or two and dig in to the menu. I've spent 20 years eating at a lot of Toronto restaurants, this is one of the best."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the past 3 days. First visit on Sunday for the Raptors game, enjoyed a few beers and shared the Nachos topped with pulled pork. The nachos were the best we've ever had in the city!!! I would definitely recommend it. We loved our experience so much we wanted to come back for the next game 2 days later. We had the chicken lollipops with habanera sauce, blue cheese sauce as well. They were very tasty with lots of spice. We also had the mac and cheese and haute poutine. Both of these were spectacular but very filling and rich. I suggest doing small sizes for both even between two people. The location of the bar is very close to where we live and I expect this will be our new go to spot! It's a great atmosphere, service, company and great food."}
{"text":"Sunday service staff slacking. Need to step up your game. Didn't try the food. Decent drink menu but not overly impressed. Nice patio to make up for some of the complaining."}
{"text":"I just don't understand it anymore ... People seem to have lowered their standards . Althought the service was good at the door and table , the food wasnt any better than you could get at a greasy diner . Put some embellished name to a a food item and overcharge should quickly be a downfall of a restaurant but when there is no real competition in the neighbourhood makes for a great business plan . Tried their pulled pork and chicken lollipops .... Below average taste and definitely overpriced for the quality . I frequent restaurants at least 3 times a week but this one won't be on my list ever again . I don't mind paying for good food but please make it really good so that I want to come back and bring friends . I could picture a certain tv chef at the table trying the various items and spitting out the food for its lack of quality ."}
{"text":"Good food and good beer. Fun spot but could use more charm and less polish."}
{"text":"Yeah, I dig this place.   Some friends and I met up for drinks and a catch-up...we ended up ordering a plate of nachos with chicken (that came on a baking sheet and was more like an army of goodness than just plain ol' nachos) and a round of drinks. Great so far!  Then, a friend ordered a meal -- she was absolutely starving -- some kind of grilled chicken dinner or something of the sort... what came out was a honking, Medieval Times type dilli-yo with french fries, all served on a cutting board. After she hacked through the skin, she said she enjoyed the chicken itself (and the fries) but the presentation was a little horrifying.  Still, we enjoyed ourselves immensely, the waiter was really great and very attentive...they had a lovely selection of wines and all in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our evening.  Yay for Prohibition!"}
{"text":"Good ideas for menu, food preparation not well executed. Poor service, slow even though the restaurant was almost empty. Disappointing experience overall."}
{"text":"I'm only here for the 5$ drink special. Food is over priced. Host is always super pleasant. Service at bar is almost always average or just above. Had my birthday here on a Monday night...I was embarrassed. One of my guests told me straight up the service here sucks. I get it... Late night Monday seperate bills.. Ppl moving, but wow!!? Her bad attitude made us feel unwelcome. Good thing she excitedly agreed to settle up with us and have us order from the bar. I don't dislike the place or even that server.. I'm just embarrassed I brought my friends to a place that didn't live up normal table service standard."}
{"text":"I've never been to Prohibition during prime time on Fri or Sat night. The five start is for their Sunday brunch. Good vibe, nice service, free meal for my 7 year old daughter and they keep her entertained with crayons. It's very nice to see a hard core night spot also cater to the local families with small kids."}
{"text":"Have had the pulled pork grilled cheese as well as the half beer can chicken, food is absoloutly insane, a little pricey but of the highest quality. Staff are great, actually know how to bartend properly, you dont get that stupid look you get when you order anythiung beyond a rum and coke like you do at some bars. Was given free shots for a little birthday celebration which really makes a difference. This is a real Gem!"}
{"text":"AMAZING mac and cheese! Full of flavour (and a hint of gorgonzola, just enough to add flavour without tasting too much like blue cheese!), unlike the mac and cheese at many other places, which is often bland, and lacking aged cheese.  I went with a group of four people and tried a bit of everyone's meal. We started with nachos, which come on a flat cookie sheet, so you can be sure all nachos have some topping, and they were quite tasty. The bison burger and pulled pork were also very good and full of flavour. Tried a bit of caprese salad as well, can't complain, the cheese was fresh imported buffalo mozzarella imported from Italy.   All in all, a great meal, not for anyone who's on a diet. We spent at least a couple hours there and had a few pitchers, great service the entire time. Will definitely be heading back to try some of the duck, and duck-fat items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love this place, as it's close to home, has a great and unique menu and great atmosphere but it is not for those even remotely on a diet. Their 4-7 and 10-? Happy Hour (hooch hour?) is nice, $5 beer and wine; the wine is a bit of a ripoff as the class is practically empty, but I will happily buy a $5 pint of Erdinger or (whatever the size is of) Delerium.  Tonight I had the bison burger with fries, which while very very tasty, was also very very juicy. Same with my friend's quesadilla. For a place that allows you to add fois gras to anything on the menu, this really wasn't that much of a shock, but still be aware tomorrow you are going to want to go for a run.  Also, if you are adverse to cigarette smoke wafting in while you eat your meal or enjoy your pint, stay away from the otherwise gorgeous garage door windows as people will stand practically inches away from you completely unaware that their smoke is fumigating your table."}
{"text":"This is a great fun place.  The videos are great to watch, the food and drinks are great and the price is right."}
{"text":"Totally in love with this bar. Its in such a great area where all my friends can meet - close to home if they need to call it an early night and a $20 cab ride downtown if we want to continue the evening. DJ BARBIE plays on Saturday nights (I've only gone in on Saturday nights so I'm not sure if she plays other nights) and she is so sweet and plays different genres for everyone to enjoy. All the decor is interesting (be sure to read the plaque by the water fountain ;)) and they have a great selection of beer. HOOCH HOUR (10:00pm - 12:00am) is amaze balls because they've got $5 pints and $2.50 shots of jager."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times, and the food is always good.  The chicken drumstick appetizer comes in so many different flavours, most of them very spicy!  Highly recommended!  It turns into a club with very loud music on weekend evenings...which isn't a bad thing, but if you weren't expecting it, it's quite a surprise when the 80's classics start blaring."}
{"text":"Facility: Located on Queen, just east of the 404. Get off at Easter and turn around. Washrooms are standard. It was a Saturday night and although the place was busy, there was no wait time to be seated (party of 2). Loads of tvs and decent music selection for dinner. We were attending and event at the Opera House and wanted to find a decent place to eat. Loaded up Yelp and Prohibition was the closest to parking with 4/5 average ratings. I would say the mark is true to experience.  Food Quality & Price: Husband had the philly cheese steak sandwich and LOVED it. They placed a Gator sauce on the table to compliment the meal. All condiments are sold at Prohibition too. So my husband picked up a bottle to go ($12). I ordered the halibut taco which was okay (3/5), next time I'll probably get a side order of mac & cheese instead. Each dish ranges from $10 - $30 (with entrees on the latter side of that scale). But sides seem pretty hefty in size. We both really enjoyed the DF (duck fat) fries and Sweet Potato fries. We made it at the end of Hooch hour and got some beers for $5 each. The cider was delicious!  Service: Was friendly and attentive. Exactly what you'd expect but nothing above and beyond.    Overall: We were really glad we picked Prohibition Gastropub for dinner. I would return if I'm in the area. There were a few annoying flies in the joint during dinner, but that's probably because the doors were left open. If you're headed to an event at the Opera House, Prohibition is a 2 minute walk from there and a safe choice to pick from. My husband had a 5/5 experience, for me it was more of a 3.5/5, so I'll rate it a 4/5 to even it out."}
{"text":"It's the kind of place you can sit with your friends and catch up. It's just solid. They do the classic pub thing well."}
{"text":"Living very close to PGH I admit I have been a couple of times. Mostly for drinks and snacks and I was not really impressed. Last time I went for drinks we couldn't even get in the place was too packed. (I didn't realize it gets this buzzy in the evening). Lets just say I had decided it was not the place for me.   Well since I have been frequenting the gym next door I often get a chance to quizzically peak at the happy diners.  So this week after a session, I needed somewhere to pop in for a quick bite with the SO, and we chose Prohibition. What a surprise!  Something has changed. The menu definitely has, and I assume the chef as well? Anyways, the food is on the pricey side but it was very very good. I had a special burger and it was outstanding. Even my side salad was excellent. High quality ingredients and alot of love. Since we made it there before 7pm, my wine and the SO's Guinness were $5 each.   Very pleased, and will return. Bonus star for the drink specials."}
{"text":"They advertise Tropicana as \"in-house squeezed fresh juice\"! They do show soccer on TV but only on mute. The food was okay, but not tasty."}
{"text":"Don't understand the why this place gets as much traffic as it does.  The food looks a lot better than it tastes (giant shrimp cocktail with the worst cocktail sauce I've ever had).  Every time I've been there, just for drinks and apps, the place had loads of seating and the incompetent staff say they're all booked up and seat us at the bar.  By the time I leave, there's still loads of seating all over the place.  Tired of the bar/restaurant mediocrity that has saturated Leslieville.  The sign sucks too."}
{"text":"Outstanding - everything  I sat at the bar with two friends (not their first rodeo) and basically said Fk yes a lot.   Everything in duck fat is a mini mouth miracle. The goddamn grilled cheese (with bacon, obviously), I would punch people in the face to get to (namaste) I had this one since it was recommended to me but since sharing is caring I sunk my teeth a couple times into my friend's pulled pork grilled cheese and the other amigo's bison burger. You know those times where you're unsure who ordered the best dish? This is one of those times. Everything is incredible.   Lobster poutine - ridonc.   I basically swooned with happiness every time I ingested anything. I'm sure the drinks are great but I focused on quelling the hunger gap. Which I did. I ate WAY past the full point, just for taste.   I basically intend to make everyone I know go so they think I'm the greatest and care about their happiness."}
{"text":"Walking into a cool atmosphere good music and lively crowd for a Monday night first impression was great. Hooch hour was a nice surprise. Brian was our server he was great friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Also did not rush us as we did say we were not in a hurry and wanted to relax. So far 5 stars. Appetizer was tater tot poutine and it was great. Raw oysters was the next, got really bad one, Brian handled it well taking them away and replacing them, no presence of a manager. Next was dinner 2 cowboy steaks and a mac n cheese. Mac n cheese was good, steaks were charred black, leaving the taste of burnt in your mouth for a while, funny thing is it was ordered med rare and cooked to the right internal temp. Again Brian recognized that the steak was not enjoyable and apologized he also took one off the bill but still no manager stopping by. I would go back and I would eat there again maybe not steak or hope they are not having an off night. Brian is awesome ask for him! He earned all the stars last night!"}
{"text":"I paid 20$ with tax for a glass of wine from a 25$ bottle at the liquor store. The bartender tried to defend it. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Fancy salads and its classy pub atmosphere!   God, I love their irish cider beer.   I was there for brunch with my boyfriend.  We both ordered salad which was spectacular.  (37 cobb and benny canard) This place definitely made me want to order salads at restaurant.(no not your regular caesar salad! :)    the bill came around $45 for two people. (two salads, orange juice, coffee, beer) It's not something I can afford every week but if the place wasn't far from my place, I would definitely come here time to time."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Prohibition earlier this week. Sat at the bar and ordered a beer, my friend ordered a burger. The burger took a little longer than we would have liked and we were on our way to a concert so time was important. We asked on the burger's status once and the bartender immediately went to check on it. She ended up giving us the burger and the beer for free due to our wait! Not necessary, but GREATLY appreciated. Amazing service, delicious food, would return any day!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is my first review, so please go easy on me. The fact that it's taken me this long to sign up and share is criminal, as I've had the privilege of experiencing some of Toronto's finest over the 3 years I've lived here. In any event, I'll try to make up for lost time with a flurry of accurate and intriguing commentaries! Now, on to Prohibition Gastrohouse...  I'd heard about Prohibition before, but completely forgot about it until a spontaneous weekday stroll through Leslieville on Thursday, May 3rd. Traveling with 2 other nouveau Torontonians, the \"East\" (i.e. everything east of Yonge) has always been the final frontier in terms of exploring the city; no longer, I say, as Prohibition definitely whetted an appetite for this vibrant neighbourhood.  AMBIANCE:  The layout of Prohibition is unique in that it forms a horseshoe around a central bar area. I'm not sure whether this is a positive or not, but I did find it impeded flow somewhat and created a barrier between the two sides of the establishment. That aside, it definitely had a homely feel, and the desired atmosphere of a welcoming, comfortable \"public house\" was attained. Numerous flat screens were well within view for those wanting to catch a glimpse of the game. Lastly, my friends and I discovered that the beer tap on top of the seat back is not merely decorative, but in fact functional for those parties wishing to purchase a keg of their own! How inspiring...  DRINK:  A wide selection of beers ranging from local microbrew, European standards, and hipster favourites awaits. The cocktail list offers something for everyone, and keeps pace with the current trend in speakeasy mixology. As for wine - although I didn't spend a huge amount of time examining the list, they appeared to have a good variety at a wide range of price points.  FOOD:  Here's where Prohibition sets itself apart from the other higher end pub/gastropub/gastrohouse establishments. Their menu is rich and unabashedly heavy, with essentially everything being cooked in duck fat. Realizing this, we started with some lighter items: first up, oysters, which were nothing out of the ordinary, with the standard sauces and horseradish toppings provided; our second shared item was the chicken liver pate, which unfortunately was a bit heavy on the spread-to-crostini ratio, and was accompanied by a rather blaze compote of sorts. The mains were when things got real, though: I had the \"pork butt\" sandwich, which included a delightful sweet and succulent piggy component complemented with a couple of artfully smoked cheeses, all pan-fried between what was likely sourdough; my pal had the 25-minute fried chicken, which was sensationally crispy but heavy enough to bump you a weight class in a MMA bout. Had we any room left over, the giant ice cream sandwich being attacked by the 4-year-old to our right would surely have been sampled.  COST:  On the higher side, but you get what you pay for!  SERVICE:  Cheerful, knowledgeable staff answered all our questions and waited on us without delay. They even promptly escorted us back to our original table after our first attempt at leaving was blockaded by the monsoon ravaging the street outside.  Overall, Prohibition left me full and well sated, with the numerous endorphins bathing my body post-meal all telling me it was a good time. Highly recommended!  - B"}
{"text":"Depends when you go there and what you have. I've been there twice - once for a quick early evening drink the other time for a Winterlicious dinner on a Saturday evening. Both times the barman and waiter and waitress were very  friendly and very professional. Reduced priced beers 5-7 and 10-11 are excellent.  The drink visit was fine. The Winterlicious visit had good craft beers and reasonably nice food (duck poutine starter, lamb shank, tiramisu - all good, though the lamb could have been hotter). The salmon in chowder main looked way too small and the fried chicken is mediocre, according to my party.  Unfortunately the kitchen cannot cope with the huge numbers in the restaurant in Winterlicious season and we waited over an hour for the starter and 1 hour 50 minutes for the main course. Maybe they shouldn't have Winterlicious and I wonder whether the kitchen can cope with the massive number of people eating there. Maybe it is too big a restaurant."}
{"text":"A local staple to many.   The place is always busy during the evening.  It might be best to reserve for dinner because there is limited space.  The general atmosphere is a cool professional crowd and you tend to notice the locals amongst everyone.  The downfall is it's kind of dark and when it's nice and sunny outside, the darkness makes it feel like you're in a cave because of the walls being painted black.  I really wished they had a patio.  The food is exceptional for pub fare - especially the nachos, but make sure to top them with their pulled pork (you will thank me).  I recommend everything, except  I don't usually eat salad so I can't really give any feedback on it.  Typically there are dinner specials.  On one occasion the special was rottisserie chicken with a cut of beef rib that was to die for.  Another was a unique dish of turkey stuffing poutine (so good).  Their 25 minute chicken is very tender and succulent - it's to die for, but be prepared to wait 25 minutes before it's served - recommended with a couple of pints.  Everything else I've tried: grilled cheese with duck poutine, oysters, flatbread, chicken lollipops, burgers are awesome.  Probably the best pub menu I've seen so far (recommend more to me please?).  There's a moderate selection of draught beers - my personal favourite is Stiegl.  Best to arrive for happy hour where pints and your typical mixed drinks are around $5 - hours are 4-7pm and then 10-closing (I believe).  Their service is awesome.  The girls behind the bar are always nice and always do their best to quench your thirst.  The bonus is that they smile and have zero attitude.  The boys aren't too bad either - they really take care of you during dinner and you'll be asked if all is well a couple of times during a sit-down, which makes it a good service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pub in the neighbourhood.  Food is consistently excellent, service is always friendly, efficient and fun and the drink selection is great.  I would agree with other reviewers that a reservation is a good idea if you don't want to wait (especially on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday).  Very much worth checking out if you're planning a night out in Riverside/Leslieville."}
{"text":"Hooch hour is the best! Great beer at $5 per pint. I'm a casual consumer, maybe going there twice a month. The service is good, the atmosphere is casual but upscale. There is an odd lack of cellular reception in parts of the bar of which others have said they've experienced the same, although I'm not sure how that could be the bar's fault. The food is a tad overpriced, and a little too greasy."}
{"text":"Been here many times for Brunch (duck poutine and goat yogurt, yes), dinner (favourites: pulled pork grilled cheese, the cheese board, oysters, and poutine!), and late night drinks. It gets pretty packed on weekends at night, but the music is pretty good and everyone is dancing.   When it's nice out they open the garage door at the front. Sitting next to it with Caesars is the perfect Sunday morning activity. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is that the service is sometimes a bit slow."}
{"text":"Was taking a business lunch (like a boss) and as I walked into Dangerous Dan's, I just knew that it wouldn't fly. Yelp monocle said that Ruby Eats was right down the street. Not open. Damn. Turned around and next option: Prohibition.   Perfect.  Hot waitress with KISS patch sewed onto apron: check Almost every entree cooked in duck fat: check Some of the most excellent sweet potato fries I've ever munched on: check  Bill was 25$ after a huge lamb-shank sloppy joe and a can of Rolling Rock - which is steep, no doubt. But I was happy.   19.99 for 5 Moosehead in a bucket at all times (beat that deal...really. Try to) and fancy bar rail for 5$ during happy hour (Grey Goose, Hendrick's, etc).  You could do a lot worse on this section of Queen.  Big fan, big fan."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have been impressed. Food and drinks are reasonably priced and the quality level is terrific. Staff are very attentive and friendly. The chef's table has great ambiance. All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"So, went in about a week ago and had some breakfast... and a vodka.  It was a rough morning! :-p  Was pleasantly surprised with this place.  Staff was very friendly; the decor was nice, and the breakfast was fantastic!  Pretty impressed.  Will be going for dinner soon.  Let you know how it goes."}
{"text":"Was hoping for a little more from this place the poutine wasn't what I was expecting it to be but still was average the service was good not much else to say decor was nice."}
{"text":"Dans le genre, c'est parfait. Ce bar-restau de l'est de la ville refuse de faire dans le style 'pub' et pr√©f√®re l'appellation 'gastropub' : mets de qualit√© et menu vari√© et enrichi. Nous y avons go√ªt√© par exemple au fameux grill-cheese, ces sandwichs au fromage pass√© √† la po√™le avec du porc √©ffiloch√© et frites cuites dans la graisse de canard. Tout le reste des mets √©tait d'aussi bonne qualit√© : soupe √† la dinde, macaroni au fromage, hamburger ... Et le service, excellent ! Tout pour gagner et tout pour plaire."}
{"text":"Great place for a drink, good service, but the food is not great. They're trying to be an upscale pub without the quality that should come with the price tag."}
{"text":"Last week, I came for lunch and the whole experience was very disappointing! This place is close to work and was hoping this would be my regular lunch spot but I don't think I will be returning.  Ordered a fried chicken sandwich and my friend a cobb salad. The chicken was raw in the middle. Took forever to flag our waiter over. He looked totally dazed and said he would fix this. About 10 minutes later, the manager came over and said a replacement sandwich will take a while but she could do a salad immediately. She was very polite and professional. Most of the other staff appeared to be new and totally clueless! The meals for the table next to us arrived by mistake and I watched them struggle to figure things out."}
{"text":"Heard about this place on the queen street, thought we will check it out since now in our neighbourhood; went with my boy friend Friday for a light dinner, The place was new the decor is just modern  enough but still cozy. The place is very large and would be nice for small group party. We didn't want to eat too heavy so we asked recommendation for some finger food; We ordered this Spanish conservas , we went with small scallops in Galician sauce, it came with  thin crunchy bread, that you can mix it is so much fun; we also ordered the sliders, kind of small hamburger, I don't normally eat hamburger but this one is so tasty! We spent 60$ with a few drinks which is pretty good. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I had my second dinner of Saturday night here.  When Wally, our server, suggested the chicken-fried ribs if I was feeling a bit peckish, I couldn't say no.  Braised and baked ribs, subsequently breaded and deep-friend.  A bit dry, but they fall right off the bone.  Served with Kozlik's Mustard!  The fries, btw, were also delicious.  Truth is, the food was really good last time I was there, too, though I don't remember what we had.  Service is better than you'd expect for a place that's more bar than restaurant.   Al in all, this is a cool place to hang, with better-than-average food and service.  There's really no good reason why I haven't given this place five stars.  It just doesn't quite seem likke a five-star joint."}
{"text":"Horrible service, felt discriminated, they seem selected with who they let in or not. Went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Found this place pretty much by accident one night when I went to one of my favourite places to find it closed. My boyfriend and my best friend were starving and started to walk around seeing what was opened. A really nice guy told us about Prohibition. We got there to be served a late night menu and all looked at each other with disappointment... The server was such a sweet heart and asked the kitchen what they could make us in terms of the regular dinner menu and the whole place seemed to go above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Not only was the service great but so was the food!"}
{"text":"Great place (not packed like sardines), great ambiance, great staff and great food and drink! Had the Buckingham Blanket, which was excellent! Will have to come back and try the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"The star is just for the staff. They were great!! Very kind and accommodating!! The rest was awful, unfortunately. I've been to the Queen East location which I quite enjoy but usually go after 10pm just for a beer and maybe the Duck Poutine.   Went to the Eglinton location for the first time. I grew up in this neighbourhood and I think the owners have really missed the mark and maybe misjudged the clientele.   Prohibition is insanely OVERPRICED!!! It's ridiculous!! The food was atrocious. My group ordered a variety of entrees including the pulled pork sandwich (the smallest, saddest looking grilled cheese I have ever seen), Mac n Cheese (smelled great but pretty small portion and barely any cheese), and I ordered the chicken sandwich. The sandwich came out looking raw. I was assured by our very lovely server that it just looked a bit odd because the chef first smoked the chicken then cooked it Sous Vide. I'm no chef but my friend who is an excellent cook said it would be very strange to smoke it THEN Sous Vide... I don't know but it was awful, cold, and honestly I still maintain it wasn't fully cooked.   The Menu makes no sense. $36 for some Spanish tapas?? It is all over the map and they don't really do anything well. I mean, $20 for crappy MAC n Cheese? $19 for basically a grilled cheese with a tiny bit of pork. $19 to add meat to a salad?! $5 to add cheese to salad?!  You can get an amazing Rack of Lamb for around $24 at BROWNS or fresh pasta over at TERRONIS.   The drinks are obviously the reason the go here. Very cheap $5 Premium rail during hooch hour. Only come here after 10pm for drinks and maybe a duck poutine or wings...though they were sold out when I visited. There is a hilarious dance floor at the very back. Yet, the DJ booth is mid restaurant. Not an ideal layout. I wonder if the people sitting up front even knew about the dance floor. Also the DJ was really rude!! Rest of the staff was cool though even security :)"}
{"text":"Fun music and atmosphere on a Saturday night! Very mixed crowd and definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I used to come here regularly but the last two times the service has been terrible. My server never brought me a drink that he rang in, and then ended his shift without telling me or any other server. And then I waited about 35 minutes to get an order of tacos. And the restaurant wasn't very busy at all. It seems like no staff member makes eye contact with you at the bar, that way no one has to actually help you."}
{"text":"Best duck poutine! great food, cheap jager!"}
{"text":"Really great evening. Good food, excellent music, Leafs ahead 1-0, and Prohibition offering a great pulse. What made the night  however was Toren. Outstanding wait staff and host for our table. Incredibly personable and makes the experience special. Enjoyed ourselves and will come back again"}
{"text":"Wow! This place knows how to do food and service. I have been here three times and each time was amazing. I first come here back in 2012 when it first was brought onto my foodie radar. The fod was good and the service was good. Each time has gotten better. We were here with 6 of us on NYE and the food was fab and the service was stellar and they managed to move us to another table after 10pm when they open that mini dancefloor. Very nice and wont be forgotten. I came here again for a friends bday. There was 15 of us and again all of us great food and awesome service.   We will be back!!!   The best part? The gost chilli wings. Man are they hot but so damn good. So was the oysters. Fresh and paired with over 12 different hot sauces to choose from.   Visit at happy (hooch hour ) and you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"A great spot for Sunday brunch, a Thursday night work party or a  full-on Friday night out with your friends, this Pub has quite the story, and quite the Facebook following!  From daily oyster bar options to comfort food selections, Prohibition has the staying power it needs to succeed in the up and coming Riverdale/Leslieville neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I'd love to comment on the food, but I can't. Ordered at 7:10 on a Tuesday night: two burgers. at 7:40 after I found a waitress we were told our order was being plated. But at 7:50 we cancelled our order and left. 40 minutes with nothing to show for it?  Fail."}
{"text":"Fresh,clean ,good service bar great drinks and food perfect place to go for a relaxing night out without dissapointment."}
{"text":"Pretty good service, at pretty good prices, and pretty good food. (A proper side salad with thinly sliced beets!)  Minimal/non-existent line ups.  They give my kid a balloon and play wacky cartoons in the morning. Kids under 5 eat brunch for free when accompanied.  Nothing fancy but the little lady loves her flat crust cheese pizza.   Whatever the formula is, Prohibition has found it.  That place is ALWAYS packed.  Good for mellow first dates, friend hang-outs, a quick, pragmatic dinner or some nachos & beer.    There are televisions and that can be very distracting."}
{"text":"I hate to do this, but a 2 hour lunch service is ridiculous.  The food and service are normally terrific, however winterlicous seems like the perfect time to just give up.  the duck fat fries were not. they were regular fries.  the brownie, well they were out of that, unapologetically.   the restaurant was mostly empty, yet the server came by for only the briefest of moments.... we were there almost 30 min before we were even able to order, and that only happened when we called her over.   including the gratuity in the total is also very poor form.  there was a time when a gratuity represent the gratefulness of the customer, appreciation for the effort of the servers.   I suppose you have to force it when that effort is completely missing.  this was one of my go-to date night places, however this one experience was so bad that I'm completely removing it my list.  damn shame."}
{"text":"Can I tell you how much I love this place? The drink prices are amazing, and the food is yummy. It's nice to have a place like this in midtown TO. The staff have been great every time I go, coming to check in and serving the perfect drinks. I'll be sure to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Prohibition was indeed a sad, sad time in history.  Thankfully, in Gastopub context it means delicious grub and plenty of booze.  We had their famous mac n' cheese.  The large portion was enough of an appetizer for three people.  Gruyere reminds me of fondue... and combined with cheddar and truffled cream it makes for some fantastic cheesy and saucy fun!  I shared the pulled pork grilled cheese with my friend.  I'm so glad we spit it... it was massive!  It's 2 sandwiches cut in half (4 half sandwiches).  That's a lot of sandwich...and butter...and more cheese...and pulled pork.  This isn't the cheapest place to grab a drink and food.  But we had a good time here and the service was excellent.  I'd stop by again for sure... maybe for some more mac n' cheese. :D"}
{"text":"I've been to Prohibition twice now - once for food, and once for drinks, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. For starters, I love how a large number of their menu items have one of the following words in it: \"bacon\", \"pork\", \"duck\", or \"fat\".  Dishes like mac 'n cheese with truffle sauce and bison sliders just top off the menu of richness.  But actually, the most fun I've had is going there for drinks after dinner. $2.50 jager shots, $5 patron...whaaaat!!  This place is awesome!!  Might I add they also have an extensive beer list at reasonable prices.  On Friday night there was a dance floor with the DJ playing some serious 90's and early 00's jams, that had me screaming, \"yeaaaah I haven't heard this for ages!\".  Note that there is something like $5 cover for the guys after 10pm but hey ladies, that doesn't affect us!  As an added bonus, there's also a green P parking lot right around the corner of Broadview, plus some street parking on Queen."}
{"text":"It used to the go to for me and my daughter but the quality is not what is used to be... They have the same menu, correction they've reduced the menu.   Had the Sous Vide rib and it was tender but zero flavour... Disappointing to say the least.  The staff are awesome though and it saddens me that they will lose myself and my daughter due to a stake menu and zero flavour in their sous vide and limited menu / variety."}
{"text":"By far the best place we went in Toronto east. Space was great, service, food and finally someone got the beer list right. Listing from least percentage to the highest ABV Thank You!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to fall in love with Prohibition Gastrohouse, but unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype for us. To use an analogy: our experience was like a first date with a guy who's amazing on paper, but there's zero chemistry in person. We were drooling over the menu, but were disappointed with our food overall.  THE GOOD: - The service was fantastic. We were seated by a very bubbly hostess, and our server was kind and attentive. I'm also happy to report that the food came very quickly.   THE BAD: - We both had the mac 'n cheese ($17.95), and added smoked pork belly for an extra $3. This is highlighted on the menu as \"TO's best\" mac 'n cheese - a pretty big statement to make in a city where awesome gastropubs are abundant. For me, this mac 'n cheese was not a winner. The combination of different cheeses was interesting, but it still tasted bland and didn't have the cheesiness I was hoping for. I could also barely see or taste the pork belly that I paid an extra $3 for. - We also shared a side of duck fat fries ($4). The only other place in Toronto where I've had duck fat fries is Beer Bistro - which were incredibly yummy, by the way - and so I had high hopes for these. Unfortunately, PG's duck fat fries were extremely salty and basically tasted like McDonald's french fries. Not a fan. - Considering how underwhelmed we were by the food, I found the prices to be borderline outrageous. Each of our mac 'n cheese dishes alone were nearly $21 - in my opinion, not worth it at all.  On our way out, I did sneak a quick peek at others' dishes and noticed that the breakfast options did look pretty good. I may consider coming back for brunch and giving this place a second chance, but I can't say PG gave us a good first impression."}
{"text":"Came during Late Night Hooch Hour (10-11 pm) and select beer/wine was $5 including Delirium...cheapest you can get it anywhere by a long shot !   The bartender gave us taste test of their three \"more adventurous beers\" including a beer made by Trappist monks. Excellent service, wide selection and great beer in a nice pub atmosphere.   On Tuesday they do \"Free Bill Tuesdays\" where one random dinner bill will be paid by the restaurant which is fun."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my meal here. Good service, great menu. My favourite is the Margherita flatbread with prosciutto added on. Bison chili is good, too. Great happy hour prices on their drinks!"}
{"text":"Refused to make a steak at 3pm since they can't do dinner prior to 5. Give me a break. Wont be going back."}
{"text":"this is my total go to when I'm in this area. It's a combo of a neighborhood bar and an upscale restaurant (without being pretentious). The drinks are amazing and they use really good quality alcohol for a very reasonable price! Hooch hour (their happy hour) is unbelievably cheap! I really like a lot of the food too... the nachos are huge (make sure you share), the breakfast poutine is amazing and comes with tater tots rather than fries, and I also love the wings. Their mac and cheese is ok... lacking some flavor.   For sports fans, they don't always play the sound on the sports events unless most of the customers request it. I was there for a playoff game and at first they said they wouldn't play the sound but everyone went up in arms and they eventually did."}
{"text":"I came here last week for brunch and also to watch the Brazil vs. Chile game. I am unfamiliar with the Riverdale area, but my out-of-town friends stayed close-by and suggested Prohibition Gastrohouse.   Overall, I was impressed with their brunch considering its bar atmosphere. They have a wide selection of items, from the traditional \"big breakfast\" to breakfast poutines, stuffed french toast and duck benedicts.  I opted for the \"Mexican Waffle\", which turned out to be a good choice. It consisted of 3 eggs, cheddar cheese and bison chili served over a crisp waffle. It's served with fresh guacamole, crema and salsa which added a nice sour component to the otherwise savory dish. It's a bit heavy, but oh so good. There were no leftovers.   They had a decent selection of draught beers and \"brunch libations.\" I ordered a \"Gastrohouse Caesar\". It was a little pricey at $10 but it had the perfect amount of heat and saltiness. The green bean garnish was also a nice textural and tasty touch.   Prohibition Gastrohouse's food and drinks were good. The TVs were plentiful and service was attentive. It also didn't hurt that the bartender was pretty cute. I was not sure what to expect coming in, but I walked away a happy customer. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Extended happy hours every day and a really tasty menu. For the vegetarians and gluten free eaters, there's something for everyone (including GF Mac and Cheese!)"}
{"text":"it was SO good, that we ended up here twice in one night.  we came here for a late lunch and pre-drinks before we went to Cabana Pool Bar. I had the prosciutto flat bread and a ceasar; my friend had a burger with fries and a beer.  our service was quick and easy, the server was super chatty (personable) and really related to us and our stories!  the best thing about this venue is that their 'hooch hour' has the best deals...Grey Goose is rail.. that was phenomenal!   As we wandered back from Cabana we ended up seeing our server outside and ended up chatting with him - that is how awesome he was - and went back in for another drink before we continued our night! I'll definitely return here if i am on that side of the city again!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite new place to meet a bunch of friends with the express purpose of eating and drinking our faces off.   Prohibition has everything I desire: great food, premium booze at very low prices, comfortable seating, friendly service, nice music and ambiance, and excellent ventilation.    How good is the food?  We celebrated my partner's birthday there all Saturday night til the wee small hours. I woke up Sunday more hungover than I've been in 20 years (cheap premium booze). I washed down some Advil with coffee, shook Samantha awake and said \"get dressed, we're going back to Prohibition right freaking now\".   And we did."}
{"text":"Nice servers, prompt service + good food, drinks and overall vibe. Tried the chicken lollipops (honey garlic and chili) -- drumsticks are a lot easier to eat than wings, and I love them both. These lollipops were deep fried to perfection with just the right amount of sauce. Also had a sizable portion of nachos with pulled pork. Although the kitchen forgot to add pork the first time around, the nachos came back to us straightaway and it was delicious. Someone in our group really likes Cobb Salad and from what I could tell, he enjoyed it because he devoured the whole thing faster than you can say...hey, how's the salad. We left Prohibition with a nice buzz and happy stomachs. I'll be back if I watch another curling match."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this restaurant because we were walking on Queen East and it smelled SO GOOD. The atmosphere was nice--a little loud but not unmanageable. I got the inside-out pulled pork grilled cheese which is the definition of comfort food. Really delicious.   Our servers weren't super attentive and they switched 3 times which was strange. Other than that small blip, it was an enjoyable experience and I would likely return just for that grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"I think I owe this delectable Toronto Gastrohouse an apology as after two visits I still have not written a review about you. That being said, this isn't a review, as a review would suggest that I have something constructive to say or \"evaluate.\" So let's call this a RAVE, not the kind filled with mind expanding drugs and loud music but as in this is \"a rave\" about Prohibition!   Just past the DVP on Queen you'll find this fantastic little gastro-resto on the north side. Set up similar in appearance to a English-Irish style pub, it is anything but that. Sure they have ample on tap and booze offerings and shots of Jagermiester are $2 any day, anytime - yep even at breakfast if you role that way. But aside from the ability to get sloshed, this spot is all about stuff your face good time grub!  Seriously, for shame I've never reviewed them after two visits, let me tell you a bit about what went down on each of my visits to P-bition:  Visit 1 - Open faced sloppy Josephine (LAWL). A chili made with a mix of meats, duck, pork, beef topped on a great piece of focaccia-style cornbread YUMM. With a side of Duck fat fries...Yep... DEADLY. I was stuffed for a solid day afterwards.  Visit 2 - Brunch/lunch with my sister. We both got the pulled pork grilled cheese served with a mixed berry compote to dip the sandwich in, served with the same duck fat fries... HOLY HADES! All grilled cheese should bow down and worship this as a the KING of Grilled Cheese. Don't wanna bow down... seriously? Do you want to get in a fight? I didn't think so...  The menu changes pretty often so there are no guarantees that you'll be able to enjoy the same awesomeness that I did, BUT I know they've always got something else cooking!  Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were great. Enjoyed the loaded pierogies, lamb shank and Mac n cheese. Awesome server. Fantastic place to celebrate a birthday! We had four birthdays to celebrate and were surprised with a big tray of desserts. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I like coming here for drinks and snacks. It's casual and low-key. We usually get the nachos and I love that you can get different sizes. Plus the nachos are baked/served on a flat tray which is great for the nacho to cheese ratio. I dislike nachos with a mountain of chips that don't get even disbursements of toppings."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out in a fun and gentrifying neighbourhood. Great service and great beer. Not such a fan of the chicken tacos... Hard taco shells? Kind of   retro but not in a good way."}
{"text":"Best services and great beers and liquor selections specially during hooch hour. Great stuff! Recommend everyone."}
{"text":"It was our second time here.  The first time it was busy so we chalked up the crappy service to that.  We gave it another shot and, well, the service still sucks.  We sat at a table and were served our initial drinks quickly.  The wine tasted like bleach (probably because the glass was not rinsed well enough).  When we brought it to the servers attention, she said \"ya, we get that complaint alot\".  She proceeded to bring another glass.  Not a glass of wine, just the glass.  For our next round of drinks we waited a while and, after unsuccessfully trying to gain our server's attention, we had to get them ourselves at the bar.  When we finally got our bill, after asking three times, I advised the server that the service was terrible.  She just smiled and shrugged.  Terrible.  There are nicer places with better food in this stretch of Queen St."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin with this review. I'll start with the 3 stars I did give it:  Star 1: visiting bar tender from Queen street location was a friendly sweetie pie. Despite things going terribly wrong at this place he was handling it all well etc etc.   Star 2: DJ was pumping old school music that totally go the vibe going!   Star 3: the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was actually pretty good!   Now on to why I docked 2 stars: How is this place able to perform at this level on such a busy prime location. Everything was broken and dirty! This place was def poorly managed. All the waiting staff looked stressed.   Worst part was when a waitress came behind the bar we had asked for our bill and first she looked confused ... insert long pause and dead stare ... followed by a rude \"you have to ask your own server. I only do the table.\" Ok, that's not unusual but I'm asking YOU cause I don't see my server. Normal practice is to say \"let me get your server\" or \"do you know who your server is? I'll ask them\" which promptly indicates politely to the customer that ooops I've clearly asked the wrong person - I shall try again.   I should have read all the terrible reviews before coming! Considering this place is already hidden and hard to get to with the construction - I don't expect business to survive under these conditions."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch (after a really late night) with friends and ordered the Mexican Waffle with eggs and chili on top of that cheesy savoury waffle! Even had a side of sour cream, pico de gallo, and guac! Great choice for many reasons: - It was hot and made fresh - I was very hungry and ate it all - It really hit the spot! - Interesting dish (including a waffle with cheese!) that I would not make at home, and therefore would be more inclined to order in a restaurant - I did not eat for the rest of the day Be warned, it has three eggs, which is quite a lot. In general, the portions were very generous here... Come hungry! My companions ordered the safer (and healthier) smoked salmon Eggs Benedict with the sauce on the side and a small salad, all of which seemed lovely. I was still pleased I ordered what I did. Coffee was fresh and unlimited (and very needed!). Service was courteous, and they even accommodated us with a high chair. As for the restaurant, would I be correct in calling this a hipster joint? Or is it more of a high-end British pub with interesting food? I never know in Toronto. Either way, I will be returning!"}
{"text":"**Actually, 3.5 stars.  I've been here twice now -- once for drinks on a weeknight and once for drinks on a weekend. I loved the vibe on the weeknight: pub-style drinking without having to be in a pub. And as many others have mentioned, the food is really tasty. I love the nachos. They're served on a baking tray, so no more bare nachos at the bottom of the pile! And their guacamole was amazing.  So I didn't expect when I came back on a Saturday night that the place was going to be a pseudo-club? It was strange, to say the least. There was even a dance floor at the back. The vibe was completely different, but fortunately, the nachos were still available!"}
{"text":"For costing as much as it did, it was just.. Okay. Very ho-hum. My friend and I had some sweet potato fries and they certainly weren't my favourite, but they did the job as I needed to load up on carbs before a concert at the Opera House ;) The service also left a LOT to be desired. Very slow and not very friendly at all. The server seemed like they were in a rush, which would have been acceptable if not condoned, but it wasn't busy at all.... Probably won't come back here, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beers. Great decor and friendly staff. Think this is my new watering hole. (AFRICA reference)"}
{"text":"The only thing worse than a bad experience at a restaurant is a bad experience that is defended by the management and staff. This was not my experience here. As you can see below, my previous comment, I was quite honest and harsh. I got a reply from the management and to my surprise, not defending but acknowledging they are not perfect and took my concerns serious and agreed about the \"tatter tots\". I like to eat as natural as possible (this is my problem) and the less time my food spends in a factory the better. I do eat out from time to time and know I have to accept what is standard fare and tend to do so. These tatter tots just pushed me over the edge. Bottom line, these people do care. Caring is as important as presentation and quality. They rank high on caring and for that I upped them one star from my previous comment. Apparently they had planned to ditch the tatters and encouraged me to try again. I will go back and try them again and will update."}
{"text":"So, two visits, service is meh... slow to greet, slow to serve, the selection is quite good, the food is good, so if you have more patience than me, it's worth a stop.   Wait, one visit, they forgot I was sitting there, so I left, second visit, it took 8 minutes for a drink and they missed ordered on my food..."}
{"text":"This is definitely, an east end gem and one of the places i miss about living there. The food is out of this world amazing and delicious combinations. Its the first pulled pork grilled cheese I've had in the city and it was amazing!! Ive also tried their mac and cheese which was so cheesy and mouth watering. They have a nice interior layout and good night scene here, as well as great deals for \"hooch hour\". They play nice music throughout day, beware it can be a little loud or chaotic at night,but they handle it well. Its a great date spot, or evening with close frIends..check it out1"}
{"text":"While the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food is pretty good - not great (although their truffle Mac and cheese rocks my world) the lack of service diminishes the entire experience. I've been to this pub a few times as it is close to where my husband works and they tend to have some good drink specials but I don't think I will be spending my money there any more. The servers who work their seem super lazy. They don't smile, they ignore their customers, we had to wave them down to get their attention multiple times - which is something I detest doing as I work in the industry as well. (Two bartenders walked right past us multiple times, pretending not to see us.) My husband and I are not difficult people to please. We usually always tip 20%, we are patient, kind and friendly customers. We know what it is like to work in a restaurant / bar. Which is why it is so incredibly frustrating to feel like we should get up and do their job for them. When I am not working and I am spending money at an establishment, I expect decent service. Usually we tend to frequent the same places where people know us and give us good service and in return we tip them well. After the three or four times we've been there, around the same time, mostly on the same nights, one would think as a bartender / server \"Hmmm.. Maybe I should talk to these people, they come often enough, sit at the bar, seem cool and kind \" etc .... It seems as if at Prohibition that they are pooling tips (??) and that they don't care about what sort of impact they have on their guests. One of the guys behind the bar (would know his name if they introduced themselves) was not as bad as the rest but when the majority of the staff is walking around like they have a golden spoon stuck up their ass, ignoring their guests, it just makes the whole place look bad. Will probably not return and find somewhere else in that neighbourhood to spend my money."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday with friends and had a wonderful time - went back the next day (Sunday of a long weekend) with a large group of about 20.   There wasn't room for us (understandable) but the hostess was horribly rude, and one of the servers (manbun) shoved my husband while saying \"I told them I couldn't serve them but they won't get out of my way.\"   I've worked in hospitality and know that this is completely unacceptable. Will not be returning and happily spent our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome caesars...sometimes I go just for the caesars. When I do eat, its usually the quesadilla or the cobb salad. Both are terrific."}
{"text":"We checked this place out as part of the Winterlicious 2012 promotion and we quite pleased.  Everything we ordered was well-prepared and well-presented and the service was excellent.  My personal recommendation is that everyone try the \"Mac & Fromage\" at least once. Be forewarned, it is a lot heavier than it looks and it tastes fantasticly rich.  Prohibition also does $5 drink specials between 6pm-7pm."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place so we went - was there with 6 people. Food was OK, bar food at best and what's decieving about it is the price. It's ridiculous. They charge you per shrimp (I have never seen this in my life !!) - A shrimp cocktail is $4 PER SHRIMP. OK. The food was alright at best and what was distracting was our crappy waitress who every time dropped by our table, had to check herself out in the mirror. How embarassing. Also, the fries should have been better - fried in duck fat - sounds amazing but they came out cold and limp."}
{"text":"Good service, lots of different beers, food is pretty good, but watch for that bill, i had to argue about home drinks 2 people consumed, they said 20, i said 12. It was long negotiation, even though i came out on top, its not worth going through that again. If you count on your bartender to be honest ..."}
{"text":"Its hard to write this review because I don't know where to start! Came here for a team lunch and had a fantastic meal. To be fair it was pretty quiet but we also had a side room to ourselves. The food came out promptly and hot. And everything we had was delicious. I will say I couldn't really tell the fries fried in duck fat tasted any different than normal fries tho (but it was good!) Server was friendly and attentive. But the best part was they had tater tots! I had the inside out grilled cheese with pulled pork. It was definitely on the oily side but ultimately a flavor bomb. Especially the raspberry jalapeno compote that came with it. A whole new dimension of flavor. Had a wonderful time and will check out hooch hour soon!"}
{"text":"The Boyz are partying here again tonight!  We met Katie (on April 6th), the new manager, and she took the time to make my friend and I feel very special; while we waited at the bar area near the entrance, Katie walked around the whole bar and then came back to say there was more room at the second back bar area...plus she took our order...plus served us our first round!  Don't worry, I'll eventually get used to posting while I'm a little tipsy plus how to submit a review, update a review or just plain check-in!  Note that this place has $2.43 PARTY SHOTS of J√§ger and JD Tennessee Honey all day/night.  The food is great and so is the atmosphere.  The DJ did a solid job with the tunes while a few of the Boyz showed dated moves on the dance floor...until 2am!  The outdoor patio at the back looks very inviting so many of us are looking forward to the 2018 grand opening..."}
{"text":"Other than it being pricy, it's the perfect local watering hole. Gets hopping in the evenings especially on weekends. Had the best grilled cheese ever with pulled pork and other fun stuff. Poutine is solid. Very close to the opera house great location for after a concert. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had the Smoked Chicken Lollipos with the Gator Hammock sauce, for the second time, and they are absolutely delicious!!! This is really far above any of the usual pub food. Exceptional quality. A very special treat. And still surprisingly affordable. Plus, they have Paulaner Hefe Weizen on Tap, which is perfect with this food item. It looks to me like the kitchen staff is very dedicated. I ordered a side of fries with garlic dip, and while the dip was delicious and the fries plenty and very ok, I would enjoy larger fries that you can eat with your hands instead of the tiny bits you really need a fork for. How will I be able to have pub chicken wings after this exceptional experience?"}
{"text":"I have been to the Queen St location for brunch, but I tried this location for the first time for dinner. Super impressed with everything. Nice layout with smart decor (drinking fountain for heavy drinkers, mirrors in each women's stall, table tech to get service). Made reservations weeks in advance. Quite busy on a Saturday evening as expected, but the service was fantastic and the food was delicious. Appetizers were not hot or freshly cooked, but the mains and dessert were excellent. We had their 36-hour sous vide short rib and seafood chowder. Excellent! To finish, the tiramisu was the icing on the cake. It is rare to get superb service, but our server was on point! I've been a restaurant server and restaurant service trainer for years, so I was impressed by her quickness, attention to detail, and friendly personality. I wish I remembered her name to request her next time!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service.  Fun atmosphere - loved the videos! Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"We checked this place out for Winterlicious - I have mixed reviews about the experience in general.  Service wasn't great - the hostess appeared to be more interested in talking to co-workers than helping people.  They were apparently quite busy with Winterlicious and I believe they don't know how to run properly at full capacity.  Service was pretty slow in general, even while dining.    Food wasn't bad - Mac N Cheese wasn't Toronto's best (as advertised) but pretty good, if not a little dry.  Beef ribs were tasty as were the appetizer salads.  Dessert was good but honestly at that point I was ready to leave from being there for 3 hours.  Happy hour is indeed a great deal, probably one of the cheaper ones in the city.  I spent a large part of the evening trying to figure out the theme of this place.  Is it a speakeasy?  But then they have music videos playing on screens that surround the bar.  Sports games are also played.  So..what's the atmosphere supposed to be?  I think Prohibition has a bit of an identity crisis.  I'd eat here again when it was a quieter day.  Prices and quality were good, service could be better the next time.  I just don't think I'd rush back."}
{"text":"Went here since they recently opened and knew they had a large back patio. I went around 1pm but was kind of disappointed when they only had a brunch menu, I really wanted something for lunch. I ordered the ceased salad with chicken (pulled chicken was the only option) thinking how bad could a plain old Caesar salad be? They used large pieces of butter lettuce that I had to cut through with a knife, what seemed like porchetta pieces that were really really fatty tasting and chunks of pulled chicken (unseasoned) with tons of gristle. So nasty! On top of that it took over 10 minutes to receive my tiny boring mimosa. Our bill for brunch with 2 drinks each was well over $80. Very disappointing and I would not likely ever return for the food. Quite expensive for poor value. Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch.  So happy that we came here as we were very satisfied with the food and service.  The servers were warm, friendly and prompt.  The food selection tends to be heavy but that is what brunches are for, right?  To laze away the afternoon.  So we had the pulled pork grilled cheese, which was rich and savoury and paired with some jam on the side.  This is truly dangerous to have as a meal because you will think this much richness is normal.  We also had the Mexican waffle, which had savoury waffles, topped with super umami bison chilli that taste so bold and decadent.  All of this with poached eggs and salsa, guacamole and sour cream on the side.  I was in meat heaven.  Yummy in my tummy.   So there it is.  A happy place for brunch and I did not have to wait in line.  What a great spot and so accessible from my hood.  I will definitely be back here again.  I will have to make sure that I have earned it before I come here though and get those extra workouts to earn the great meals here."}
{"text":"I came here after a concert at Opera House on the promise that they had really good poutine and I was not disappointed at all. Large order on the late night menu was around 15$ if I can recall, and it was amazing. Had to get 2 orders. Besides that I ordered shots of jager and I asked the waitress to have them chilled. When she brought it to me she told me I cant keep asking her to chill shots.   I'm sorry, what?  If I want my shots chilled there is no reason that I shouldn't be able to have them served cold. Gah!  I was pleased with food but extremely unpleased with service. We had to go around the bar looking for our waitress because she barely even attended our table."}
{"text":"Of this I'm sure: Prohibition is a great place to get a drink.   That being said, everything else got a little hazy as the night progressed due to said drinks.  I came here with a friend to discuss some business things. The place was absolutely packed so we sat at the bar and did some work on my laptop, thanks to the FREE WIFI.  A couple of hours and some pints of Innis & Gunn later, we sat at a table and split the bison burger. The burger was pretty good, from my recollection.  What I really liked about the place was the service: everyone who served us was really professional and genuinely friendly.   It's not the best place to hold a business meeting, due to the fact that it's pretty loud in there, but the free wifi is great. It may have been easier to talk in one of the few booths in the place.  It's a bit pricey here, but I might check it out again because I like the atmosphere so much."}
{"text":"The worst breakfast I have ever had. We waited for over a hour & i had to send my eggs back because they were still liquid."}
{"text":"The food was great, service was fantastic - present and supportive without being obnoxious -  and we loved the overall vibe of the place. They very deliberately avoid the current pop music and range from the 80's tunes which provided a fun backdrop to our meal last night, to a mix of soul/jazz/blues and Motown on the weekends (per our server, Claire). In fact my friend and I decided we'd make it our new 'local'. The drink options and the regular menu are fantastic - I would give it a huge thumbs up. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Review is for the food only. Ordered the grilled cheese with home smoked bacon, and side of tater tots.   The grilled cheese was disappointing, considering the price point on it (somewhere around $16 incl the bacon). The tater tots were pretty good (they had real crunch to em).  Wouldn't return for the food."}
{"text":"Expect great drink deals (Happy Hour $5.09 drinks), decent food and below average service.   We enjoyed their fish tacos. It was good portion size and the fish was fresh. The fish was battered and fried nicely that it was not dry or too oily. The slaw was crunchy which gave the tacos a good texture. Only thing to complain about is there was barely any pico di gallo on our tacos.   We tried their truffle oil mac n cheese because we heard good things about it. Lightly breaded on top and you can distinctly taste the truffle oil in the mac n cheese. It was aromatic and had great flavours. They used penne for the mac n cheese and it was a little bit undercooked.  Their pulled pork burger was ok, not amazing. It was good portion size. Their fries were also ok.   For dessert we ordered a strawberry donut. It tasted like a donut that has been out for too long, covered in whip cream and drizzled with strawberry syrup..... would not recommend this and not worth it.   I came here with one other friend and we were both very disappointed in the service. The waitress basically ignored us for the whole 3 hours we were there... she was happily making conversations with the table beside us (even offering them a drink on the house for their wait on the food)... We also waited for 1.5hr before our food came out to us. She had her back towards us most of the time while she was talking to the other table.. It was hard to even get a drink menu from her and I had to call someone else for it.   Honestly the service we received makes it hard for us wanting to come back.... the only thing that would draw us back here is probably during their happy hour."}
{"text":"Was hoping this place would be like a Yonge/Eg Queen and Beaver...went with friend...she had the fish and chips and said they were the saltiest things she'd ever eaten...I had one of her french fries and just about chocked on the salt...I had the fish tacos which were mediocre...and within five hours both of us were feeling sick...literally the only thing I ate was a bagel for breakfast and the fish tacos...she had a smoothie for breakfast and the fish and chips...neither one of us would return...I am still feeling sick as I write this review!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place has great deals for drinks! Their \"hooch hour\" is from 5-7, 10-11 and offers drinks for $5.09. My friends and I arrived at 7:30, so we just missed it! D: However, we noticed almost right away that they offer shots of Jack Honey or Jager for only $2.43 (CAD)!! We ordered rounds almost immediately. (NYE weekend - swear we don't have a problem)  Service was very good. Our waitress was extremely friendly and checked back on us regularly. The menu was extensive - serving up a variety of entrees to choose from.  My friend and I decided to share the duck confit poutine. I actually never eat duck, but figured I'd give it a shot! The flavor of the duck/gravy was great. It surprisingly wasn't too heavy considering it's gravy & French fries. The fries were cooked perfectly, so you didn't get super soggy fries. I also liked the variety of hot sauces they provided on the table.   Overall, a great place to eat and drink!"}
{"text":"Although I did not live through Prohibition, which referred to the ban on alcohol and a period where bootlegging thrived, there's something naughty in the name that drew me to make reservations at Prohibition Gastrohouse.    Once inside, you will be greeted by overall dim lighting, booth seats that remind you of the rooms that men used to retire to to have a cigar and brandy, and accents of neon signs.  The most interesting piece of decor for me was the rotating liquor rack.  Talk about irony.  Another interesting fixture was the beer fridge which quoted George Jean Nathan (a drama critic and editor) which read \"I drink to make other people interesting.\"  The restaurant was definitely visually appealing and had a lot of character.   For appetizers we tried the P√¢t√© Br√ªl√©e and Mini Haute Poutine.  It was interesting both from a textural and taste perspective.  Offals are usually an acquired taste for most, but the otherwise \"gamey\" taste was offset by the caramelized sugar which had a slightly \"burnt\" taste to it.  I usually indulge in liver of the duck variety, and was surprised that the chicken liver actually had a more pronounced taste to it.  Texturally you had the creaminess of the liver coupled with the crunchy crostinis and sweet berry jam.  My only regret was that there wasn't more crostini for the excess liver left over.  If there's one thing you should know about the food prepared at Prohibition - there is a lot of duck fat swimming around in the kitchen.  I am all for using natural fats to flavour your food.  While on paper this sounded wonderful, the presentation was not.  The colour of the gravy was this light brown-ish colour that looked utterly unappetizing.  The duck confit was soft but lacking in any real flavour and the fries were pretty soggy.  Again, I applaud the specialty ingredients that Prohibition used, but it just didn't look or taste great.  Our water glasses were topped up whenever they were nearing empty.  Our server checked up on us from time to time to make sure everything was fine.  I was impressed with our server.  The kitchen staff however - not so much.  I say this because from the time our appetizers were taken away to the time our mains showed up at our table, about 30 minutes had elapsed.  Our server was kind enough to let us known about 20 minutes in that the food wouldn't be much longer. They were over capacity with 2 large b-day crowds, the Winterlish crowd, and the local crowd.    By the time our mains (Lamb Shank and Mac et Fromage) came out, we were hungry.  To add insult to injury, the Lamb Shank was cold.  While it was quite tender, the absence of a reduction or jus made an otherwise promising dish from reaching its potential.  The scalloped potatoes were bland and not crispy.  Nothing compared to Julia Child's Potato Dauphinois!  It also came with a side of green beans.  The portion size was quite sufficient.  My Mac et Fromage came in a modest portion.  I've heard people claim Prohibition serves the best mac and cheese.  I beg to differ.  And I nominate Trevor Kitchen & Bar for having a better mac and cheese.  The promise of Vesuvio pasta was substituted by a common penne.  The sharpness from the 2 kinds of aged cheese (Cheddar and Gruy√®re) all but drowned out our dearest Elizabeth (Bleu).  If there was any truffle oil it turned out as just oily sans the truffle and the brioche crust that was supposed to provide the crunchy top was also MIA.  If this spells the best mac and cheese in Toronto - kudos to you!  I will add however that their mac was buttery and creamy, and I quite enjoyed the grainy texture of the cheese sauce.  For dessert we opted for the Eton Mess and the Triple Layer Brownie Cake.  The Eton Mess was something I had never experienced before; hailing all the way from England; it is made with meringue and strawberries and topped with whipped cream.  Great textures from the crunchy meringue which contrasted the smooth whipping cream.  Ixnay on the un-fresh strawberries (which also made an appearance as an accompaniment to my Triple Layer Brownie Cake).  The Triple Layer Brownie caked looked like a store-bought cake.  The Balkan Yogurt & Whipped Cream Frosting was definitely a \"sour\" note in the dessert and was most wrongfully matched with the brownie cake.  I just don't understand why one would decide to put a dollop of tart frosting that does nothing to enhance the taste of the cake.  This is one of the many times I actually didn't finish my dessert.  At the end of the night, our server came with a bill that already included gratuity.  I looked around me to see if I had any invisible friends from my childhood sitting next to me to form a party of 6 which would warrant a tacked on gratuity.  Alas, it was just me and my dining companion who were taxed with an 18% gratuity.  I guess we should be counting our blessings that Prohibition didn't catch on to the article from the Toronto Star boasting that 20 is the new 15."}
{"text":"I can't stop talking about Prohibition, but maybe I should, as it might get me in trouble, horizontally.  A few classmates and I have what we call \"Flask Fridays\" which really translates into a visit to a pub on Fridays after class. We've visited bars on the east end, downtown, in the west end, you name it, we've got 8 more weeks to go and hopefully just as many bars.  To start with, we weren't aiming to go to Prohibition, we were looking to hit the Avro or The Comrade but the former wasn't open yet (5pm on a Friday, open yer doors!) and the latter was closed ALL JANUARY, so off to Prohibition we went, and it was the best decision on the block.  They have happy hour pricings, pint specials, drink specials and some insanely delicious beers on tap (Innis & Gunn, Flying Monkeys, Beaus, etc) not to mention some of the best gastro-pubby snack food this side of the Don Valley.   We came in early, 5pm and didn't leave til 10, we had the macaroni and cheese, the duck fat tater tots (which have ruined regular tator tors for me forever), a few pints each and we spanned TWO different shifts of servers. The mac and cheese was huge and split between two people and the tater tots was definitely a sharing dish. While we didn't order the sheet nachos, the table beside us did and it was also gigantic and perfect for sharing.  In terms of pricing, a person can nom and leave under $30 but if you really want to try a variety of the foods and beers you'll spend more.  But my favourite part of Prohibition was the service. They were quick, friendly, attentive and FUN. When my first beer turned out to be flat, they were on it like a bonnet, sniffing it, pouring a bit from the tap and tasting what they pulled. No muss, no questions, they apologized profusely and came back with a second beer of my choice. CLASSY. The service only continued to be great from there on. I will go back here any day, any time and you should do it too."}
{"text":"I had 2 pints of Guinness and a duck poutine which was delicious. We went there before 7 o'clock and so the pints were only five dollars.  They provided a good amount of pulled duck on the poutine so great value, even at 12$.    Reading other reviews it looks like they have some other items I will need to try as well."}
{"text":"Sweet mother of god this place is awesome.   If you do one thing, make sure you order the chicken. So juicy and well seasoned. Not exactly the healthiest thing you'll ever eat, but it was ridiculously good.   Everything else was good too (oysters, fungi pizza, and fresh beer) but the chicken was a delicious roundhouse to the taste buds. Shouldn't be missed."}
{"text":"My office is across the street from this location (Eglinton), so we go to this particular Prohibition weekly - much to my chagrin.  I always make a point of ordering a beer with my bill, because I've never got a drink faster than 20 minutes. Today, I arrived at 5:20, was served at 5:40, and got my first drink at 6:15. 45 minutes. It took 45 minutes from when I arrived to get a drink. The crazy thing is that this is par for the course here.  Somehow, my peers still insist that we frequent this location despite a plethora of options available in the area - for what reason I will never know.   If management reads this, your staff are great, but you need many, many more of them because this is junior kindergarten-esque. Get it together."}
{"text":"I love prohibition. I've been their numerous times for dinner and drinks. I never realized they served such a fantastic brunch. I highly recommend going for brunch one day. Honestly it was the best egg's Benedict I've ever had."}
{"text":"All around great experience.  Comfortable bar experience, but with great service, diverse craft beer on draft and most importantly a menu that you won't find elsewhere.  From mac and cheese with pork belly to surf and turf Philly cheesesteak with lobster.  If your a foody, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars.   Great food, excellent service and the space has wonderful character. It's great for groups, and the people were really friendly.   I booked a table for 10 for lunch with work, the lady on the phone was very much appreciated that I made a reservation as if a lot of people don't do such thing for a large party.   Table was ready to go when we got there, and the server asked us if we wanted separate bills. Love the proactiveness.   Everyone on this menu is something I want to try. It was really hard to pick, and I reminded myself most likely I will come back. This is pub fare with flaire, and for me anyway, gluttony at its best. You have burgers and sandwiches, which come with duck fat frites or you can sub a poutine (chilli cheese with bison and bacon among others) or a exceptional mac and cheese ($10) with bacon (+3).  They also have sharing platters as well.   AND some dishes you can add a Foie Gras for $18 (to your sandwich, burger) etc.   They seem to make lots of accommodations about dietary restrictions. Like you can get a pulled pork sandwich without the pork!  Everyone's meal looked excellent today. I got the Sloppy Josephine (braised lamb shank in duck fat, on a foccaia) with a side of mac n cheese , even though i know it was so bad for me I had to try it. And it was just as amazing as everyone says it is. If you like mac n cheese, go for this.  The portions are quite big. I think I could have just eaten this MacNCheese side on it's own and it would be for me. Although the guys in the group finished off their giant bison burger. Oh, and you can get the MacNCheese to be gluten free.   Its a bit more pricey than you would expect it, but packs in much more flavour than your typical chain restaurant, and has a lot of heart in the presentation. It was $30 for my meal today.   Will definitely be back for sure! Everyone loved it."}
{"text":"Hi I am a local to Prohibition and really enjoy coming here for brunch, dinner and late night drinks. I usually always have a positive experience except when I dined there last Sunday. I brought my friend from out of town because I enjoy this place and although the bartender was really nice she wasn't really on point. Being a server and manager for over 6 years its hard not to critique places and I don't normally like to complain but the last experience left a bad taste in my mouth. We both ordered coffee which came cold. We then ordered our brunch ( my friend got the regular breakfast with eggs, bacon, and hash browns and I ordered my favourite, the duck confit benny). The duck confit benny came with two loonie size pieces of duck, a WAD of benny sauce and still frozen bread on the bottom. While the salad was delicious the hash browns were not the usual that were on the menu. They resembled tater tots with no flavouring or spices (like they usually have). I ended up not eating 90% of my meal and the bartender did not say a thing to me! I also didn't want to complain in front of my friend but I needed to voice my dissatisfaction. What was once usually my favourite place to come to brunch is now a place to go if I can't go anywhere else."}

{"text":"It's been awhile since I spoiled myself to some pretty damned good food. And by pretty damned good food, I'm talking about your guiltiest pleasures with a twist.  Prohibition has been on my radar for quite some time now. It's one of the few restaurants I've been eyeing during the commute between downtown and the Beaches. It took being transferred to Leslieville for work to finally give it a try!  We all took advantage of the Winterlicious menu and came in time for their Hooch Hour. $5 beers? Hello! Anyway, we all ordered the poutine, got two orders of the mac and cheese, and one order of the lamb shank, and ended with two orders of the Triple Layer Brownie Cake and one order of the Chocolate Mascarpone Mousse.  We were all pleased with our poutine. The fries still had enough crunch and crispiness to it, and it wasn't smothered with too much of the duck gravy. The best part was the duck confit, which was just perfect.   The mac and cheese, despite its small serving and cutely shaped pasta, was amazing. It must've been the black truffles that did its magic as I might go on record and saying this might be the best mac and cheese I've ever had (and this is coming from someone who loves his Southern style mac and cheese)!  Finally, there was the Triple Layer Brownie Cake. which I was expecting a rich cake (I mean, c'mon, a triple layer?), but it was nice and balanced, without being overly too sweet. The mousse, on the other hand, was a bit much for me, but sweet enough for my cousin who loves her sweets.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience with pretty attentive service by our server (who's name I didn't catch). It's definitely somewhere we all agreed we'd come back for, even with its regular menu.  I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Ohhhkay! Soo. The mac + cheese at this place is hands down - immaculately delicious. I'm not normally a pasta eater at restaurants, especially macaroni and cheese but all of my other dining friends weren't shut up about it, so I had to order it. I desperately wanted to order another serving after I was done but didn't wanna seem like a major fat boy slim in front of the four other men that I was dining with, so I didn't. I was tempted to say to the waitress 'I'll take 3 orders for take out please - for my roommates.\"....ya, right! TRUST! Do yourself a favor and order it!  The nachos were also very good but nothing to rave home about. When I LOVE a meal, I want that feeling of wanting to go back just for that specific item. Nachos didn't do that for me. But the mac + cheese sure did:)"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I have been to Prohibition a handful of times and each time has been great. Tonight, we took a few of our friends here for drinks and we made it just in time for Hooch Hour. $5.09 premium bar rail, all draft and bottles, and house wine. Can't beat that! I was able to get a Kettel One and cranberry for a great price and our friends enjoyed the selection of beers.   Prohibition also offers $2.43 shots of jager and honey jack all day, every day. You can get drunk for next to nothing.   We ordered the nachos to share with the table and while impressive in size, I found the cheese toppings a bit too scarce. It was however, served with a side of guacamole (and sour cream and pico de gallo), which was a nice touch. Most places would charge extra for that.   My fianc√© ordered another pint after Hooch hour and it was kind of pricey for just one drink. I would suggest coming in during those two time windows. One is 9pm - 11pm and I can't remember the other one. I THINK it's 5pm -  7pm, but don't take my word on it."}
{"text":"I'm upping my review to 5-stars (from a solid 4) because I can easily say that this is my favourite place to eat in Toronto.  If I could eat here every day without getting fat/going broke, I would.  The food is consistently good.  The service is consistently good.  The atmosphere is relaxed but refined.  Yes, it's a bit pricey, but the food is rich and delicious and if I were on death row I would request Prohibition's mac and cheese as my last meal.  If an out-of-town family member comes for a visit, this is where I always take them for dinner.  Brunch the next day too, if we can swing it.  I honestly cannot rave about this place enough.  Even on occasions where there have been problems, we've been taken care of and compensated for any issues.  Seriously, I have zero complaints.  I'm more of a dinner-goer so I can't speak about the service and atmosphere later at night when the booze starts flowing a little more freely, but when we don't have any dinner ideas and find ourselves craving mac and cheese, I am so grateful that Prohibition is just around the corner."}
{"text":"For what it is this place does it for me.  I've seen it evolve from it's first days  and continue to go back.  From breakfast (Duck Confit Benedict) to grilled cheese with bacon with a side of poutine or the mac and cheese (you can order it with bacon), the bison burger and nachos by the 1/4, 1/2 or full tray - perfect!!  Lots of great beer on tap, TV sports, dining street side open air or roll down window in the winter, booth or table in the 'dining' area - it's ALL GOOD.  Service has always been good to great too.  Prohibition does it nice."}
{"text":"Signs of a true foodie: you aren't afraid to declare that your new favourite brunch place is right next door to a strip club. Seriously though, don't let Jilly's next door deceive you- our brunch gathering at Prohibition certainly resulted in a happy ending.   What I ordered: Bison burger ($13)- DELICIOUS. Admittedly, the best burger I have had all summer. The bread is made in house, super moist and chewy. The bison was also grilled to a medium rare perfection (or however you like it). Just deliciousness, deliciousness all around.  Soup of the Day ($6)- Smoked Tomato. Equally amazing and my favourite tomato soup to date. The smoky flavour had a strong presence, but not overwhelming as you can also taste a nice background of spices. I definitely thanked Past-Sisi and gave myself a pat on the back for ordering this. It was one of those mid-August days where you start to feel the chill fall air creeping in, and the soup felt like a warm Snuggie in my tummy.   Other impressive things: - Unique menu: It is filled with plenty of  fun items that you don't typically see on brunch menus, from Mexican Waffles to Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese to Pulled Pork Grilled Cheese (Future-Sisi better be seriously grateful for Present-Sisi for resisting the temptation to get this. Seriously. Grateful.) The menu also describes each item in fancy sounding words like lardon and essence of truffle that makes you feel like you're at a fancy brunch place when in actuality you are not and are actually only in a pub next to a strip club.   - Most things are made in-house: I.e. they have an in-house smoker that smokes fish and meats to my delicious smoked tomato soup. They also bake their own bread. They fry a lot of the items with duck fat aka extra delicious fat.   - Friendly service in a relaxing atmosphere  Overall, a highly recommended spot for all your brunching needs."}
{"text":"Top shelf product. No question.   My wife and I finally checked this place out last night. The food was great. The wine was great. Hell, even the water was great (with just the right sized wedge of lemon--I hate it when the lemon in your water is too big or too small).  Service was spot-on, friendly, and knowledgeable; I tested him, he knew what he was talking about. I like that. (Not that I test all servers I come across--last night I was feeling a little punchy.)  I ordered the Bison Burger. So good! Seriously. The meat is seasoned perfectly to where the flavor of the meat is the main stage and cast of the show. Fresh produce on board an artisan bun with a healthy amount of just-the-right-color fried onions (as requested extra) made the burger a work of art. Sweet frites were my choice of accompaniment, and I wasn't disappointed. No flimsy fries here.   My wife had the Nicoise Salad. She said she enjoyed, but that it was perhaps a little over dressed. Otherwise it looked like a finely composed salad with sushi-grade tuna on top.   Incidentally, I like hot sauce, so I had a side order of the De Arbol sauce--hot, but fantastic. So much better than the typical Tobasco-or-Frank's?-run-o-the-mill pub-like version of hot sauce.   The Zinfandel we ordered with dinner was above average for by-the-glass wine. So much so I asked the brand and intend to buy some.   All in all, I look forward to my next visit--and you should definitely go!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch last Sunday w/ my boyfriend & we both loved it. The atmosphere is cool; modern, hip, and laid back. Our waitress was fabulous & the food was fantastic. We got the haute poutine, truffle Mac & cheese, & stuffed French toast bake & they were all fantastic. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There is a good vibe here at Prohibition Gastrohouse and is a deservingly 3.5 star establishment.  Stepped in for a drink, fries, and onion rings as a nightcap for the evening.  We couldn't stand the wait at the Broadview Hotel once we were able to go up to the patio.  We traded a stand-up patio view of the city at the Broadview Hotel for a ground level open window patio section of Prohibition.  We were happy with our final decision.  They have great happy hour specials nearly every day of the week but we were in-between the happy hours.    Hope to come back again during happy hour and try some more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner here last night and they continued to serve food and drinks an hour after having no running water. The toilets were not flushing, no water to wash hands etc. The management was unapologetic for dirty glasses and even referred us to speak to the bouncers if we had an issue.   On top of that, we were a large group meaning the 18% tip was included on the bill. Our server took total advantage and only came by our table 3 times in 4 hours. I honestly have not had worse service in Toronto in the last 15 years."}
{"text":"Possibly the best fish and chips I've had in my life and I travel to London a couple times a year.  The mac and cheese was good but I think I'd prefer it without the blue cheese.  I think it would be amazing without that hint of bitterness.  Overall excellent quality, service and a nice place.  I can see why it's always busy."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great environment. Great staff. The food is far beyond what you would expect from a pub. Delicious."}
{"text":"Definitely do not come here for a light meal or if you're on a diet. The food is heavy but that's the point! It is quite pricey compared to other brunch places. The negative is the food does not come with the sides, so we got the mac n cheese but was charged the reg price. Which was quite disappointing. I enjoyed the food the latte I had was yummy. BF had the orange creamsicle milkshake which was very good. Overall was a good experience, definitely should try if you've never been but expect to fork out a bit of $$$."}
{"text":"Very impressed; the duck poutine was smothered in gravy and had both melted cheese and small curds. The duck wings were intensely flavored with teriyaki, very game-y. While smaller than expected, they were unique: the leaner meat is crunchier and tougher, but was capitalized nicely by a kick of hot pepper.   The beer and wine selections have something for everyone, and the menu has at least something for picky eaters.  This is a great place to grab drinks and dinner in a casual gastropub. Don't expect super fast service, as it's relatively large inside, but the high number of tables for two make this a good place to share stories and hang out over drinks with a close friend or a date."}
{"text":"Came here for a little happy hour action, and it was pretty awesome. Hey call it Hooch Hour, and some pretty stellar deals on that drink menu. Ate a ceasar salad, which was really good for a ceasar...would love to come back to this joint and try more things cuz the service was outstanding and the vibe was on point."}
{"text":"After the Yelp Elite event, some of us wanted a few more bites plus beer. Upon recommendation from another Yelp Elite. We got quick seats at the chefs table and watched them prepare the orders for other tables including ourselves.  However, I was disappointed in the food. We tried T.O.'s Best Truffle Mac & Cheese and Karaage Chicken. The mac and cheese was ok but the chicken was not what we expected as it was soaked completely with Maple-Chili Glace. There was way too much sauce and it was similar to wings with sweet sauce. Nothing special about this place so likely will not return."}
{"text":"Good Lord, where to start with this place.  I used to live in East Chinatown about three years ago, and Prohibition was a great place to visit; excellent tap selection, friendly, prompt service, etc.   How times have changed...  I don't know if these guys have gone through an ownership change or what, but the last four times I've been here, the staff seem to be new every time, and seriously abysmal in every way.  It's now a regular occurrence for me to get a different beer than what I asked for, while being utterly neglected in every way. These new servers don't seem to have any knowledge about the product they're selling, let alone have a vested interest in their guests. Seems odd, given the fact that beyond their \"Hooch Hour\", this place is insanely expensive for the location (ten bucks for a side of fries? okay...). You'd think the quality of staff would at least reflect their prices.  I would recommend avoiding this place, unless again, you're visiting during Hooch hour (7-10pm and 10-11pm everyday), in which case you can get an imported draught beer for five bucks. Beyond that, have fun paying a high price for God awful service, while Chumbawamba plays looped on the various TV screens around you, and idiot bros sit at the bar trying to impress their dates over $2.50 jagermeisters.   Seems telling that there's no contact feature on their website..."}
{"text":"Showed up on a Saturday night around 8pm, and learned that it was a good thing that we only needed a table for 2 because otherwise there would've been quite a wait. But luckily being a small group, we managed to get a small table near the front west side corner which suited us well.   The interior is a pub meets sports bar cross over, which is a bit different and more casual than the normal gastropub vibe, but still worked. Not sure if it was because it was a Saturday night, but there was a surprising mix of music including Daft Punk, Deadmau5, Justice and other mainstream electro tunes.  The draught beer selection is rather impressive with lots of good local and import selections to choose from. $2.43 Jager shots any time of the day is an interesting value prop as well, but being the driver for the night I was unable to take advantage.  As for the food, well first thing I'll say is that we ordered too much to eat, but 3 of 4 items were deemed successes. We started with the Prosciutto Pio Tosini which is a lovely serving tray filled with prociutto, butter, a loaf of uncut tostini bread, and a pile of nuts which all worked quite well with eachother. Our other started was not such a success. We went with the Redneck Poutine and were quite disappointed by it. The lamb was good but didnt really fit the rest of the flavours, and most importantly the tater tots were a mushy mess in the bottom of the dish. A waste of $12.  The mains however were great. Wer'e talking one of the top 5 pulled pork sandwiches in the city! Not as saucy as I usually prefer but still a perfect balance of flavour with a pretty healthy amount of pork on the bun. I also got to try the Open Face Sloppy Josephine in all of its glory with the stacked pieces of lamb on top of a really thick piece of bread. I really liked it, and feel it redeemed the lamb disappointment of the redneck poutine. For sides, the DF Frites are better than Sweet Potato Frites by a long shot. The sweet potatoe fries seemed a bit too limp and greasy.  Throw in the combination of good food with friendly service, it leaves me to say that while I don't go to the east side often, when I do, it'll be for Prohibition!"}
{"text":"First off. Yes Sara KP, no one should miss on the irony that I went to \"Prohibition\"  Please note: I did live in Dubai in my teens, so defo had a lot of bootleggers! Though none of them were as amazing as Prohibition!  Called on Monday to get a reservation for Wednesday, the final day for the WINTERLICIOUS Menu.  Called on Wednesday to up my reservation from 4 to 6, and she did it happily :)  Went it and we were seated at the best table in the house. Super tall with bar stools. Really cool.   As soon as we walked in, we could smell the amazing food. My tumz was rumbz fo sho.  Our choices were:  1. Apps : EVERYONE HAD THE MAC AND CHEESE. Though the portion was tiny, it was immaculate. Perfect blend of truffle and cheese. MATCH MADE IN MY TUMMYS HEAVEN. I want millions and millions of orders of this stuff. They are magic.   2. Main Entrees: I had the Pulled Pork Grilled Cheese. GUY THIS PORTION WAS HUGE. IT WAS TWO SAMMIES + A HUGE PORTION OF DUCK FAT FRITES. From now on, I insist that everything be cooked in Duck Fat. The pulled pork was so fucking amazing. It came with a side of Raspberry-Jalapeno compote, which went with it SO WELL. And usually, I dislike sweet things in my mains, but boy, was it amazing. Im drooling right now. Someone needs to come and clean up this mess yo.  My friends went with the BIson Burger - IT HAD THE BEST BACON I EVER DID PUT IN MA MOUTH. Wild Boar is definitely everything I need in my life from now on. The bison was cooked beautifully. The bun was awesome.   And then finally, my other friend went with the Mushroom Flatbread. BOY WAS THERE A WHOLE LOAD OF MUSHROOMS ON THERE. Too woodsy though.   3. Desert, we got all the options. The cheesecake was awesome. Really good. Red Velvet Base. In a mason Jar. YUM. The chocolate mousse I was not allowed to try (my friend devoured it before I could even glance at it). And the creme de marscopone was amazing as well.   SIDE NOTES:  1.  I ordered Dead Elephant beer. Don't. That shits nasty. Too bad I'm not a beer maven like Sami  2. My friend also had the Redneck Poutine. If perfection was possible, it came SO FREAKING CLOSE. I only had one bite, so I will have to go back to re-assess it. It's calling my name,  FINAL THOUGHTS  I shouldn't have ordered everything cheese. Within 20 minutes of our dinner, CHEESEAGEDDON happened. (I'm lactose intolerant)  (I did it to myself)  OH NOTE  The washrooms were awesome + clean but down the stairs."}
{"text":"Claims to have T.O.'s best mac and cheese.... it was good- but only if you eat like a bird- portion was tiny!!  Is this a pub? I think not. Pubs serve Real portions when you order a Main, not an appetizer sized hipster slap in the face.  They should remove pub from their name.   If you are hungry- go elsewhere! As I left hungry after 'eating dinner' here."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  We had dinner Oct 3 2012 - I had Mac and Cheese with bacon (yummy) and my date had a bison burger (also very good).  Then we moved to bar and enjoyed the $2.50 Jaeger shots.  It ended up going from a 7 pm dinner to a midnight walk out.  Good times."}
{"text":"Sorry to say the \"upscale comfort food\" wasn't fresh or fun. 1 stars for my dry Double Decker Club Italiano sandwich ($18!). And 1 star for my fishy fish taco."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Stephanie the manager is very unprofessional. 23 of us will NOT come back, walk a little further on Yonge and go to Spacco or Alleycatz.  Note, if you make a reservation and try calling their phone goes straight to an automated machine. Worst customer service, bad music, and bartenders who are unclean."}
{"text":"It lives up to the hype! Came here on a Friday night, not expecting to have seats available and stubborn me refused to call for reservations.. No seats indeed but I was perfectly fine settling for the bar. There's ample parking on the street, probably because it's the emptier side of downtown. There's green P parking right at queen st E & broadview, but also free street parking after 4pm on weekdays. Probably the 2nd time in my life I parallel parked by choice.   The restaurant is huge and the bar is also very large. Sitting at the bar was pretty good, because I got a nice clear view of the jays game and the actual bar is big enough to enjoy a meal. The drink menu is huge and the Belgium beer my boyfriend had was amazingly smooth. The food was actually delicious as well! Pulled pork grilled cheese is the queen of all sandwiches, oh my goodness. The double decker chicken club was yummy as well, even though the chicken tasted suspiciously from costco. However, the toast was crunchy and soft at the same time, which I was a huge fan of. The veggies was also fresh.   Service was amazing and even though we were at the bar, we were attended to many times. The food came quickly and the workers were nice. Also, a cool thing is that on Fridays (or maybe weekends), one area of the restaurant turns into a dance floor. Cool! I'd definitely come back, maybe even for the Friday night dance parties. Any tips on the crowd here during those times?"}
{"text":"Beer selection is on point! I audibly ah'd after my first sip of La Trappe Trippel.  Came here with a couple of people on a Wednesday night and it was still decently occupied. Maybe I was being picky, but I wasn't impressed with their sandwich/burger selection - 3 pulled meat sandwiches, and one burger. I order a pulled pork grilled cheese and it came with a garden salad (creative and unique but too much dressing), and a sweet sauce to dip the sandwich, which was a perfect accompaniment. They're also well known for their duck fat fries - and a duck poutine which is incredibly rich. I would recommend sharing that one!  Overall good experience; good beer selection, few cocktails and a \"premium\" bar rail, different types of food, good service. I think this place has enough variety to please a mixed crowd, but still offer a different experience from the \"typical\" sports bars."}
{"text":"I came here after work on a Thursday evening with 6 of my colleagues and I was super glad we reserved the table by the window. It can get quite stuffy as the night goes on so sitting next to a huge window definitely made it easier to breath. Also it gets quite crowded at night and the window seating was kinda in a corner/booth so we didnt bump into anyone.  This pub has many different beer on tap to choose from, im not a big beer drinker so I cant really comment on the variety and taste.   In terms of taste, they serve pretty good food here. I got the chicken and waffles for $25.75. That day was definitely my cheat day, cuz it came with many pieces of fried chicken and four ham and cheese stuffed waffles. Talk about a food coma afterwards......... The chicken was crispy, but I think it was a bit over fried for my taste as it was a bit dry. The chicken pieces consisted of chicken breast, thigh, and drumstick. The waffles were good and the maple syrup that came with it went well with the chicken and waffles. Im pretty sure they mixed the maple syrup with some other sauce because it wasnt overly sweet and was kinda savoury too. And of course I wouldnt finish this dish cuz it was huge.   My friend got the truffle mac and cheese for 18.75. It was so creamy and cheesy and I believe they are known for their mac and cheese. My other friend got some sort of grilled rib and it was super super flavourful and soft especially the charcoal taste. Im kinda jealous I didnt get that. It also came with mash potato and salad. My other friend got the famming greek burger and she said it was big and juicy. It looked big. I tried one of their fries and it wasnt crispy, kinda soggy actually. I heard their tater tots were better.  Overall, the food was nice and fresh. Our waiter was friendly but he kinda messed up on all our drink orders and billed it wrongly. He fixed it at the end but it took sooo long so it was kinda annoying to deal with. But he was nice and apologitic about it. We all make mistakes.  I will definitely come back to try their brunch menu and definitely the grilled rib :)"}
{"text":"I find this place to be hit & miss. Not bad but not great. Marscapone stuffed french toast is off the hook though!"}
{"text":"Awesome Gastropoda in Toronto! Great selection of draft beer and wine. Didn't wait too long on a busy Friday night. Our waiter was great. Very informative staff including the bartenders. They knew their stuff! Food was great, really nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Decently priced drinks. The bison burger was great with a caesar worth the price. The 1/4 nachos are enough to feed a family of four! The chicken on the nachos (optional) wasn't very good, but after you pull it off they were superb. The service was lacking as I think three waitstaff plus kitchen were working and it was far too busy to be understaffed that way. The ambiance and atmosphere was great, and the nachos would make me a repeat customer despite the lacking service."}
{"text":"These guys have a solid place. They were finally able to accommodate my gluten intolerance with a lettuce wrap. The fish tacos were great. I have to say that the staff are exceptionally helpful. It's great that they have an organic wine on the menu. I've also tried the nachos with pulled chicken ... Very generous so good to share. My companion had the Mac 'n Cheese and ordered it a second time on another occasion. My friend had the duck poutine: looked delicious if you want something rich. The balsamic vinaigrette is delicate and tasty and salad greens very fresh. It's a good neighborhood go to place especially because of the personable staff."}
{"text":"I have two views of Prohibition Gastrohouse.   Restaurant: when it comes to really good food in a great atmosphere served by friendly and efficient staff at decent prices this place has it locked down. I've had quite a bit off their menu and so far the Mac n Cheese was the only thing that was a let down (surprisingly Frans Diner is ridiculously better!).   As a bar/club: are you a douche bro? do you like hanging out with douche bros? is being repeatedly hit on by douche bros a great way to spend a night? when it comes to entertainment, is watching douche bros hit on uninterested/completely drunk women something you enjoy?   ....if you answered yes to any of these questions you'll love this place!   Also, the bartenders never really seem interested in serving people so it takes forever to get a drink, said douche bros have a really bad habit of pushing women out of the way for drinks, it's crammed so there's little room to move around without having your ass grabbed by some douche bro, the bathrooms are tiny and if you're not careful you'll likely get bashed by the door while drying your hands, and the cover charge only applies to men - which is great if you're a single girl - HOWEVER, if you show up with your boyfriend, expect to pay (happened to me on 4 occasions - advice, if you're with your partner don't go in together and save some money).   Definitely come here if you're looking for somewhere new to go for dinner, whether with a date, co workers, or friends but stay away from their bar nights... unless you're a douche bro. You'll feel right at home."}
{"text":"Have dine here many times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. Love their brunch menu, and have an amazing houch hour daily."}
{"text":"First time coming here. I live in the area and was really looking forward to it. In a nutshell probably wont be back.   ---  Arrived on a Saturday evening to grab a bite and grab some drinks at 10:10pm and was told that there was a $5 cover. I suppose that's ok for a club or bar but for a \"gastrohouse\" a tad unusual.   Our group was seated quickly and we ordered. Really liked their Hooch Hour prices.   About an hour and a half after being seated the hired Security guard walks up to our table and tells us we can't be seating here because it was reserved. Ok... we were seated at this table by YOUR staff, it's not right to then tell us to leave because it was reserved by someone else. They claim they're creating a new table for us to move to to seat our party. 30 minutes passes, no alternative table is offered. One of the several waitresses serving our table comes back after another 15 minutes, apologetic but claims yet again that we have to move because the table we were seated at was reserved.   In a nutshell, get your act together Prohibition! A) Don't sit a party at a reserved table.  B) if you sit a party at a reserved table, don't have a security guard come to them and tell them to move after they've been seated there for over an hour.  C) if the above does happen, offer them something!  I will say the waiters we had were really good BUT the establishment as a whole needs to get their act together!  No refunds. No complementary anything was provided, thus this review.  At the end of it, we were never shown to our new table nor actually kicked out. So rudely interrupted and told to get out of our table for 0 reason."}
{"text":"From the outside you might not think this place was worth a look, but deffinitely give it a try.  Great beer list, something for every preference.  Food is hearty, homemade and very tasty.  I recommend the cobb salad and the poitine (sans duck if that is too fancy)!  The nachos are also killer - perfect for a shared snack.  The wine servings are scant and a waste of money, but if you stick to beer you won't break the bank.    Sit near the window and watch the crowds pass by - enjoy!"}
{"text":"$2.50 Jagershots + Good food = Happy Chris.  Happy or Happy drunk? either or this is a sweet spot if you live in the east end.  I tried the flatbread which was really good.  This place is usually bumping on the weekend...well $2.50 Jagers, after 5 of those you should be good to go."}
{"text":"Apparently things have changed in the Kitchen, lamb shanks don't fall off the bone. Beef ribs no longer savoury sweet. It can't be all about the booze. Loved the food in past but there has been a change and it's not good. So sad;("}
{"text":"when I'm in the neighbourhood without my dogs this is my go to place.  Love the food the atmosphere.  Always some friendly punters sitting at the bar, which is low so shorties like me can put their feet on the ground, cheers for that. The food has always been fantastic a good variety and presented nicely for a pub. Highly recommend.  Even had our company Christmas party here and they handled it all very well, great service"}
{"text":"Located a few venues west of Jilly's, dim lighting, the decor was interesting, & the bar had lots of character.  Me & Yvonne T. went here for the Winterlicious menu.   For appetizers: \"P√¢t√© Br√ªl√©e\" & \"Mini Haute Poutine\".    The P√¢t√©  was excellent in flavour & texture, however, not enough crostinis were provided as there were lots of the chicken liver left after the the last crostini was eaten.  The Poutine, fries were prepared in duck lard so I was expecting crisp robust fries, the duck toppings were not as flavorful as I remembered a duck confit to be. The dish portions were lacking, duck was not the best & the fries were soggy.   25 minutes passed after we finished our appetizers before our mains came to the table.   For mains:\"Lamb Shank\" & \"Mac et Fromage\"  Lamb Shank was tender, however it came out cold & there was no juice or sauce which could have easily made the dish significantly better.  The scalloped taters were soft & had no flavor. The dish could have very easily been better.  Mac et Fromage was good, nice flavor & the cheese's texture was enjoyable. I would not have minded if there was a little more of it to go around.   For dessert: \"Eton Mess\" & \"Triple Layer Brownie Cake\"  The brownie in the brownie cake was not really brownie at all, more like supermarket cake. The Eton mess was interesting, like a lump of macaron at the bottom of some whipped cream like substance.   At the end of it all the bill came but also included gratuity, 18% gratuity, most uncharacteristic of western restaurants. I do not think I will revisit."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner around hooch hour. Ordered some drinks for $5.09 each to start off. My friends had the custom burgers and I had the mussels. Not bad! We got a free tiramisu from the server due to an error on their end, which was unexpected.   This is a nice place to hangout for drinks during hooch hours. Don't miss it~"}
{"text":"I'm big on service, so, given the reviews on here about things being spotty in that respect, had given my husband permission to tell me to lighten up if I got too uptight. Happily, a memorable date night was had! We tried a few expertly-prepared cocktails, the mushroom flatbread (wow), a steak & frites special, and the green salad. Server Nicole was lovely - never rushed, attentive, knowledgable, and very surprisingly on her second day on the job. Plus, she's from the East coast, so obviously points for that. It's pretty loud in there, but not terribly so. I'd go back. And get the mushroom flatbread again."}
{"text":"Great fast service. Truffle mac n cheese, bison chill and fish tacos were delicious! Mac n cheese being the favourite. Will Be back!"}
{"text":"We didn't order any food - just a few drinks.  Wasn't impressed with either the drinks nor the prices (although there are happy hour prices).   It's going for that loud, cool vibe but I wasn't feeling it.  While this location is conveniently located in the Yonge/Eglinton area, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Went in after driving by so many times. It just happened that we were hungry and we thought we'd finally check this place out. Lucky for us we went during happy hour! :)  Ordered the Mac & Cheese with bacon, Ceasar Salad and a couple of drinks for happy hour. I do have to say the Mac & Cheese is good but I've had better at a bar in cabbagetown.  Service was quick and our waiter was friendly.  If I was in the area and hungry I would go back but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"The only thing that prevents me from giving this place 4 stars are the prices of drinks and food.  The menu is is full of unique and classic items, but dinner and drinks in what appears to be a bar and grill can easily hit $100 after tax and tip.  I had the bison burger and a beer and it was nearly $30.  The burger was very tasty, real juicy, and topped with crisp, fresh vegetables.  The inside is a mix between modern and rustic, with great open walled tables looking on the street front.  The service is usually spot on quick and the washrooms very clean.  Overall it just feels like an overpriced bar and grill."}
{"text":"They're Mac and cheese is delish here!  It's super busy and on the weekend they charge cover (at least to guys). The servers here are nice, and the food is great.  Definitely a great place to hang out with a bunch of friends."}
{"text":"WHOOHOO is definitely right for this place. I have to gather my thoughts and summon my inner writer because I want to write the review to end all reviews for this place....  I went here at around 11-11:30am on a Monday. Of course it wasn't packed, but closer to lunch time it started to gather more and more anxious, hungry customers of all shapes and sizes. There were suits, hipsters, mommies, teenagers, etc etc..... The atmosphere is perfect in here. It's dimly lit, it can be romantic if you want it to or just relaxing if you're gulping down a drink with a friend.   FOOD: chicken drumsticks come in 3 and they're $3 each, minimum order of 3. Cheap for what you get - the sauce was AMAZZZZIIINNNGGG!!! GLORIOUS, DELICIOUS, ORGASMIC you name it. We ordered the third flavour from the end...I can't remember what it's called but it's a version of Habanero. It gets spicier as you move down the list - ending with Naga (ghost pepper which is deadly. try at your own risk...). Super duper amazing. One of the best chicken drumsticks I have ever had.  Then the open faced sloppy Josephine with duck fat fries - it comes on a piece of really really really soft bread, mixed with grilled veggies, delicious sauce and lettuce with some kind of creamy chipotle on top. It was messy but doable and horrible mouthwatering. Just embarrassing how much I salavated at this place...   Next we have the Haute Poutine - duck fat fries, cheese curds and duck confit.....jesus all mighty....this food must be served to the gods. IT WAS AMAZING. taste buds were just exploding all over the place.  I recommend his to anyone and everyone. They have awesome beers on tap, great witty quotes all over the walls, cute waitresses (i fell in love with mine, have been stalking her since), cheap Jagger....anything anyone could ask for.   THIS PLACE IS NOT OVERRATED!!!! It's not even AYCE and look how much I'm raving about it...it must be a gem.   HAPPY INDULGING xoxo"}
{"text":"I'm here right now.  The food is above average and the beer menu is too (though that's not saying much in Toronto).  The atmosphere was better and the food amazing before they changed formats to a more sports bar feel.  I'd probably rate them better if their hostess wasn't so consistently miserable. Without fail, whoever is in the role is dismissive, short, and unhelpful. I'm your typical Canadian so am undyingly polite to service staff, I wait for them to approach me (far longer than necessary, typically) and I don't ask more than a question or two. I'm not sure what I've done to deserve the treatment, but I truly miss the place this used to be."}
{"text":"the story behind this place is as follows:  they originally wanted to call this place \"the booze emporium\" and because of the community not wanting to have a place in their midst that has the word booze in its title because it would attract dodgy folks they had to find a different name and brilliantly came up with prohibition.  though the story is interesting, the whole thing is so stupid on so many levels.  there are bars for people who need to be drunk 24/7 and this is not one of them because likely most of those folks wouldnt be able to afford it - not to say that there arent well off folks who spend their days in bars or being drunk all the time too.  anyhow, for a pub i think the food is quite good actually.  ive had the mac and cheese which has found itself back on the new menu - made with elbow macaroni, oka classic, asiago, parmigiano-reggiano,truffle scented cream, and panko breadcrumb crust (hardly pedestrian in both taste and makeup).  ive also had the nachos which were very crunchy and filled with cheese, the chicken caesar salad which was awesome and pints and pints of caffreys which is on tap.  its a richly designed pub with dark wood, brass and  a full bar.   the food is not cheap, so if you are stuck on the notion of this just being a pub and pub food shouldnt be that expensive you might be turned off by the price but not necessarily the food.  i dont care for all the tvs that around. its hard to be there and not be distracted by one.   they do have bands there which i dont recall as being anything spectacular, but ive never regarded this place as a music venue either.  so for a fresh take on pub food made with better ingredients (at the very least in terms of style and quality), good choices for beer, a lively atmosphere come bring your shifty self to this place for a brewsky man."}
{"text":"We got great service but horrible, overpriced food. My steak was cold, my salad somehow wasn't cut up whatsoever so I had to deal with huge pieces of lettuce. My friends burger was salty and the cocktail that I got was disgusting. It's a cool enough venue but I'd redo the menu because there's so much potential.   Also who only has one dessert? Like we could choose from baked Alaska to a scoop of ice cream- are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Hooch Hour is fun!  I came here with my meetup group and I am impressed with the Hooch Hour. $5 beer and mixed drinks. They have a good selection of beer. I discovered Innis & Gunn and now I want to go steady with it.  The service was friendly and personable but I had to ask our server to bring us water, after we had been there for over an hour and a half. The company was good, the place has a great decor and a good mix of people.  I enjoyed my meal: the mac & cheese. It's made with fancy cheese but the shallots and herbs gave it a good kick."}
{"text":"Wow! Best addition to Yonge and Eg in a decade. Very impressive bar menu. Excellent service. Outstanding drink selection.   We arrived at 9:40 pm. Our waiter first suggested we wait until 10:00 to order so that we could take advantage of their happy hour. From 5-7pm and 10-11 pm, all tap beers and a variety of wine & cocktails are $5. La Trappe, Delirium, etc. for $5!?!?   Our waiter offered several food suggestions - pointing out their \"platter\" as the most popular dish. We took his advice, ordering a selection of fried chicken, biscuits, truffle mac n cheese, and \"The Rib\". Boy, was he right. The food was incredible!  The rib was on par with any top restaurant in the city. 2 massive fall off the bone beef ribs. Indescribable.   You're in for a special experience at Prohibition. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my 6-year-old and was really pleasantly surprised (not having any clue what was in the area other than Jilly's). It's nice & posh to look at - cloth napkins etc. - and really great food (duck fat fries!) but really reasonably priced and with a great kid's menu. My son had the plain cheese pizza which was I think only $4 and just the right size (as opposed to being served, as so many kids' items are, with a mountain of fries that only guarantee he will have no room for real food). It's always a rare treat to find a place nice enough for a grownup that can still keep a kid happy. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Meal was meh, definitely not worth the $. After I finished eating I went outside for a dart. When I came back in a bouncer asked me to stop and show him my stamp. I explained that I was here for my sisters birthday and had a table. Thinking the bouncer would realize his mistake and welcome me, he does the opposite. The bouncer tells me I have to pay cover charge. I calmly try to explain to him that I have been in the restaurant for over an hour, ate a meal, and am returning from outside. Apparently this was too difficult to understand and his unquestioned authority and power have been challenged. Now a 2nd bouncer is looming over me. In order to show the world how much power the little bouncer has he says I can return to my table \"gee thanks\" but get this...he tells me I have to turn my baseball cap around so the brim faces forward. I actually try and reason w meathead however he starts talking to me about gangs and danger of backwards caps. I tell the two bouncers that my hat was fine when I entered the place and no I will not turn it around. The bouncer insisted on bullying me so I said I would wait outside rather than comply with his BS. I did not re-enter and gladly waited 20 mins in the cold for my wife, sister and friend. Apparently the waitress and manager attempted to intervene however they essentially did nothing. Great way to treat your customers, obviously won't be back and why anyone would pay cover to enter that place is beyond me. Avoid at all costs. 1 star is too much."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks after 10pm on Fridays, what's not to love?  There's usually a two seater somewhere (although it's madly packed on the weekends) and although sometimes the waitresses/bartenders can get inattentive, they're definitely above average compare to other bars in downtown Toronto.   I have yet to try the food, and I definitely will soon (+ a drink)."}
{"text":"My friends and I went for dinner the other day and we got there around 6:30pm, which meant we could order beer at their happy hour prices ($5.09). This seems insanely good; however, you are not getting a true pint of beer for that price, so it's not as cheap as you first think. (my beer was 16oz) That being said, it's still a good price for a beer after work and their list is better than most places.   I have to say, the menu here has a lot of really unique items. However, I don't know that I would be in any way inclined to spend $45 on a surf & turf Philly cheesesteak sandwich. In fact, I would rather go to the Keg around the corner for a sirloin steak & 8oz. lobster tail for the same price.  I ordered the daily special, which was a jerk chicken quesadilla for $13.95. It tasted fine and was a decent portion, however, it was mostly filled with potatoes, which the server failed to mention. Given that I was already getting my fair share of potatoes with my side order of fries, I would likely have chosen something else, or even just gotten a different side.  One of my friends had the Flaming Greek Burger, which was topped with fried Kefalotyri cheese. They bring a shot of flaming Sambuca or Ouzo (I'm guessing, because the server didn't actually say what it was, she just poured it on) and then doused the flame with a squeeze of lemon juice. Given that my friend doesn't drink alcohol, it was a bit of a surprise to him. The menu doesn't mention this part, and the server didn't even ask if it was ok - just poured it on and left. He ate the burger, but I really think this should be detailed on the menu, or have the server explain this at the time of ordering. Not everyone wants booze poured on their food.  This seems like it could be a fun place to have drinks with friends after work, but I can't say I'm too inclined to want to eat there. Prices are about 20% higher than they should be. This is not fine dining, it's pub food. Interesting, for sure, but still pub food."}
{"text":"So much hope for this place.  Great review and I've enjoy the Leslieville location on many occasions. I'm hoping they're just working out the kinks. It was loud, very busy and understaffed.     We stopped in after work for a drink and a bite to eat.  It's just so happened to be happy hour which had a good selection of beers to choose from at $5.09 (don't understand the $0.09?).  That was followed by a half dozen of Rodney's oyster house oysters at $3 a shuck.  They're Rodney's.  you know they'll be good.   Mains included the double decker club Italiano with tater tots (because I'm 8) and the fish and chips. The sandwich was great but the tots were inedible with the amount of salt that was put on them (someone had a salt bae moment in the back).   As for the fish, I'm always weary of getting fish and chips anywhere other than a fish and chips place.   It was definitely not fresh.  The outside was over cooked and the inside undercooked.  The fennel slaw that came out with it was brown.  We brought this to the waitresses attention and she agreed that it was unappetizing.  She then proceeded to tell us about how she's worked in fine dining and this would never be allowed.  The waitress returned with the bill and advised us that she had notified the kitchen and they also agreed about the slaw however no concessions or adjustments were made to our bill.   One last thing that seems to be a growing trend that irritates me is the pre designated gratuity percentage on the point of sales machines starting at 15% and going upwards of 20%.  Sorry gratuity, like respect is earned and not given.     Maybe we'll try again once they work out the kinks of a newly opened restaurant."}
{"text":"If I was rating the restaurant on its own, I would give this place 3 stars.  However, I've also been here a couple of times when the bar turns into a club and that bumps it up to a 4  I love the decor of this gastropub.  The staff are lovely and the service, excellent.  When I came here for dinner we almost ate at the bar (which would have been fine because they have the full menu there) because it took longer than expected to get a table.  The hostess apologized profusely and we decided to sit at a table.    We had the tacos, mac and cheese, duck fat fries and pulled pork grilled cheese.  If you have mac and cheese on your menu, I've probably tried it.  I've been told that Prohibition has one of the best on the menu, so I was quite disappointed that it was cold on the inside.  There was lots of flavour, but I almost felt like they went a little too crazy with the truffles.  The tacos I couldn't eat at all.  I bet they were good, but they were so spicy and I couldn't hand them - I don't like spice at all.  I wish the menu (or even the waitress) would have mentioned it beforehand.  I was taken completely by surprise.  From the one bite I had as well, I could tell the shells were stale too!  The duck fat fries were delicious.  I love the skinny cut for the fries, and they weren't super greasy.  The pulled pork grilled cheese was also tasty.  Although I wasn't really happy with the meal, I would come back to try some other dishes.    This place kind of turns into a supper club at night.  This part is always fun.  Their happy hour is during times you actually want the happy hour to be (5-7pm and 10-11pm).  I love coming to this place around 10 or so, having some jager shots and dancing the nice away.  The crowd is usually friendly, the bar staff are quick, and the dj isn't bad.  Make sure you don't come too late if you don't want to wait in line though!"}
{"text":"Technically a 3.5.     It's not a pub nor a gastropub or even a restaurant. It is a gastro-house.  I must admit,  I was quite thrown off by this bustling place when I walked in. Because I was not sure what it was trying to be. Now, of course, I do know - a gastro house.  The vibe of this place does feel like a busy pub. I could hear the loud voices of men drinking and talking about man things. I assume because they were so loud. LOL  Happy hours with a constant jagermeister specials scream - pub. If only I was younger and thought this was wine.  Part of me thinks that because its not a restaurant it can get away with some culinary license. It is true but since it's not a pub I do expect more. So now on to the food.  Definitely more pricey than a pub. Not many a bar can claim foie gras and confit on their menus.  A variety of items to choose from including daily specials.  Categories to choose from include: ruffage, big stuff, handheld, gastrospuds, hodgepodge etc....  The funny thing I found about this place was the plating. Just not appetizing looking.  I was scoping out the yelp image bank and I scratched my head to ask, why, plate like that?   The open faced steak sandwich was tasty. Grilled medium rare meat perfection. I could taste the char. Mmmm. If you are a steak lover - you know what I mean. The accompanying salad was overdressed but that aside I give them points for not using the spring mix.  What intrigued me about my dish was the rosemary focaccia bread the steak was paired with.  When eaten together it completely worked. I was sitting there eating this, surprise in my mouth. (yeah i said that). Although the bread was dry and the presentation, sucked, it was pretty good.     All round I would go back to this place.  It's energetic and definitely a modern pub.  A fun place to go chill before or after a show. The east side, Leslieville, has some awesome to offer you."}
{"text":"I've been to the Prohibition location on Queen about a half dozen times, with a great experience each time and nothing to complain about.  The relaxing atmosphere and classy crowd is always something you can expect at Prohibition.  My initial impression of the Eglinton location was positive, as they had renovated the location to look almost identical to the one on Queen down to the layout, chairs, and 80's pop hits that were being played.  Most people were sitting outdoors, but we chose to sit inside instead since the remaining patio seating was soaked from earlier rainfall.  I feel the service was sluggish as a result of this, and I initially decided to give them the benefit of the doubt since we had not yet received our food.  Their beer and drinks selection is impeccable, with a wide range of craft lagers and ales on their menu.    We tried the Sierra Nevada and Muskoka beers, which each came in branded beer glasses which I thought was a very nice touch.  We ordered the duck poutine, comprising of fries, duck fat gravy, cheese curds, and pieces of cooked duck.  I am not a very picky eater, but the chunks of duck had an awful stale taste to it that was too offensive to ignore.  I was sharing the poutine with a friend, and we only got through a couple of bites before unanimously agreeing that it was not palatable at all and we could not continue eating.  Bland, stale and inedible food is unacceptable, even more so when you are paying a premium price.  The chicken lollipops we ordered were much better, even though they were cold by the time it was brought to our table.  The lollipops were made of barbecue flavoured chicken and basted in a tasty sauce.   Disappointed with our experience and still hungry, we decided to ask for the bill and leave to get something to eat somewhere else.  I was even more upset with the service, as the bill took over 10 minutes to arrive.  I'm not sure if they were understaffed, or just inattentive.  This seems like a good place to go for drinks with friends, but I would avoid the food as it is in my opinion overpriced and potentially poorly prepared.  Suffice to say, I do not think I will be returning to this Eglinton location of Prohibiton again.  I really hope they do get their act together, as it does have the potential to be a successful franchise!"}
{"text":"A lot of people seem to rave about this place but I just don't really understand it. Maybe it's because I've only gone there for bunch and perhaps the dinner menu is better but I disliked both of my experiences there.   I had the pulled pork grilled cheese on both occasions (only because nothing else on the menu seemed even the least bit appetizing but I should have learned my lesson the first time). It was pretty bad on both accounts. I found it so incredibly greasy. My side salad came dressed with so much dressing that the leaves were dripping. It was completely inedible. I had the fries as a side the second time, they were good but being able to make something fried in duck fat taste good is kind of a no brainer.  The others at the table thought the food was mediocre to okay, at best, but when you call yourself a gastropub and charge for food like a gastropub - then the food should be more than the local pub down the street. I found it to be significantly overpriced, way too greasy and generally just not very good. Any hint of satisfaction our table had with the food was quickly dashed when we saw the bill. You've got to be kidding me.   One of the members of our party was a vegetarian. When asked about the limited veggie options the server simply replied that she could have anything on the menu made just without meat. Which basically narrowed her choices down to a grilled cheese or a quesadilla. Good thing she wasn't a vegan.   Our server so incredibly fake nice and did little to show that she actually cared about her job or our experience at the restaurant. The encounters I had with other staff members were the same - fake and uncomfortable.   As time goes on I still hear people rave about the place for some reason that I don't really understand. It seems to be fairly busy so I guess it probably has some redeeming qualities. The service and the atmosphere surely aren't the reason, so i suppose it's the food? I'd love to say I'll try it again, next time at dinner, but I don't want to risk wasting money on such disappointing greasy food.   Basically it's (insert name of local suburban pub chain) food at twice the price minus half the variety and charm."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the service, food, and atmosphere! My friend and I went during their happy hour and ordered a couple of glasses of red wine and their amazing duck fat fries! It was my first time trying duck fat fries and they were thick and not very greasy. The servers were very attentive, talkative, and friendly. Every few minutes a new server would come by and ask if we needed or wanted anything. The atmosphere was very laid back, they had awesome music and videos playing. Overall I felt appreciated and wanted. Definitely will come back to Prohibition when I am in the Toronto area again!"}
{"text":"This review is for the cheese/charcuterie board. True, it wasn't cheap...I believe it was around $45. But it was enough to feed two and had a major deliciousness factor. Four generous cuts of very different cheese (blue, hard, creamy, sheepy) were served with a jammy compote, balsamic glaze and walnuts to mix and match flavours. On the meat side were 3 thinly sliced salami and prosciutto-type selections along with a spicy sausage and creamy liver pate. Those were accompanied by both honey mustard and crunchy mustard. Four slices of beautifully soft-toasted, thick-cut bread was the perfect partner in crime for all of the above.  My one complaint is that the board was served to us with no explanation of what anything was. But I guess we also could have called them over to ask.  Anyhoo, we washed the whole thing down with flights of beer (because 4 mini beers is always better than 1 giant beer, IMHO) and lived happily ever after!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I ordered a mac & cheese and it was the best mac & cheese I've ever had. The sauce was creamy and not too salty. The order is large, I recommend splitting it with a friend. Also, try their duck fat fries... so good!! Soft and chewy :)"}
{"text":"Good place, a friend of mine is moving away and I took him here as a goodbye present. we both got a pint of beer, he got the pulled pork nachos and I got the Margarita pizza (the one in the picture). Fuck me our food was good, and filling. Even though both our meals were appetizers we were both stuffed after eating. The place has a nice atmosphere, its cool but not snobby or anything. $2.50 jager shots all the time. I had a great time here and I'm sure I will be back again. Only downside is the price. Our 2 pints and 2 appetizers set me back $60. An even bigger shock because im so used to going to mi gia phung these days where I can get drunk of my arse and a full stomach for about $20  nice place though, although until I'm a millionare I probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Haven't been here as frequently as I would have liked, as the place shines in so many areas. Gastro Pubs do tend to be a cut above the rest, but this one is a step better.  First, the name. What a cool name for a pub. Real throwback feel. The atmosphere is the same. Classically styled brass rails, bolstered seats and good lighting.  The food here is amazing. Most of my reviews contain frequent references to how good the fries were, and this is no exception. They're excellent. Burger is great as well. It's been awhile since I've been here (I moved and it's now way out of the way, but I'd still go if there was an event that called for it or otherwise), but I remember the food is great. Lots of drink selection, and the prices aren't unreasonable.   They also have a dance area should the mood strike, and are set up to cater parties as far as I know as well.  Go check it out, totally worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Been a fan of Leslieville location and glad to see them in my hood.  Same great food and service.  2.50 Jack and Jaegar shots. Mac and Cheese is the best.  Ask for Hannah from New Brunswick. Super friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Went there for the second time last night.  Mushroom flatbread is out of this world.  Cobb salad was well dressed and delicious. Fish tacos equally good.  $2.67 shots of j√§ger and jd?  Yes.  Are you kidding me.  Friendliest wait staff and great atmosphere.  Can't wait to make the trek down to prohibition again."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch the other day as it was recommended on Blog TO for a good spot to eat with a young one in tow. Upon entering we were welcomed by a bright and cheerful waitress and seated in a booth which is perfect when you have a child with you.  When looking at the menu I found the kids meal section and was disappointed that it said all kids meals come with pop so I asked our waitress if we could sub it for apple juice instead. I was told unfortunately not. Kids meals only include pop and apple juice would be an additional $2. What?!! I find it incredible that they do not allow a child to have juice or milk with the kids meal. I mean isn't encouraging our youth to drink pop a big part of the problem our southern neighbours have? In my opinion the kids meal should just not come with a drink if thats the case. What's the point?  I ordered the Ultimate Mac & Cheese an my hubby got the daily special, Pierogies. I was totally excited about my mac & cheese. On the menu it listed things like 4 different gourmet cheeses, fresh herbs and truffle oil. YUM!! When our food came I was disappointed that all those delicious flavours were over taken by just one cheese. My hubby's Pierogies on the other hand....OMG! It was amazing!! I wish I had ordered that.  Overall I would come back here to give it another try but it would definitely be a kid free visit."}
{"text":"Excellent portions and quality. I had the bison burger which was delicious. My friend tried the lamb shank and they served him TWO meaty shanks. Great value for money, great selection of beers, great ambiance and reasonably priced.  Would definitely go back again for the bison burger."}
{"text":"I come here all the time as my brother lives in the area. Pulled pork grilled cheese is so good! Mac and cheese is also sinful and wonderful at the same time. They have a nice drinks selection, and a cider on tap, which is always a positive in my books."}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in Toronto for high class, high quality pub food!   I love their happy hour deals, can't go wrong starting your meal with a $2.50 Jack Daniels or J√§ger shot!  This was one of only places I've been to in Toronto with Delirium Tremens for a good price (Half the price of Warehouse)!  But they really won me over when I first asked for hot sauce and the waiter brought me a cast iron pot full of unique heats and flavours. A thing of beauty.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Came for the Summerlicious dinner menu, $28 with a starter, entree and a dessert. The place itself definitely has more of a pub feel, they offer a bunch of local beers. Wanted to order the perogies, but since they were sold out, settled for the shrimp tostada for starter. Fish tacos for the main. Strawberry shortcake for dessert.  The shrimp tostada was a shrimp salad on a large nacho on a bed of avocado, topped with a shrimp. Pretty tasty, and good presentation, but a little small. The fish tacos came with two tacos and some duck fat fries. The tacos can vary in size, but were quite delicious. Fries were okay. My girlfriend ordered the truffle oil Mac N Cheese. The truffle oil really comes through, very strong flavour. Definitely worth trying. The dessert was kind of lacking. It seemed to be a shortcake made of store bought donuts. Not impressed here. Overall though, a fun meal."}
{"text":"Came for brunch during a recent statuary holiday and the place was empty. Several tables trickled in after we got there but remained generally empty for our meal.  I had the Breakfast poutine: 3 Soft Poached Eggs on top of a pile of crispy tater tots, drowned in bearnaise, curds and bacon. It was creamy, smokey, crunchy and amazing.  The tater tots were perfectly crunchy and help up well under the sauce and eggs. My friend didn't want her bacon so I was the lucky recipient of extra bacon. Score!   Unfortunately I have to minus one star for the really slow service. Our waitress was really sweet and great when she was with us. However, she seemed like the only one on duty for the whole floor that morning and was run off her feet. We waited a good while for our food, and then there was another 20 minutes between getting our bills and actually getting a machine to pay said bills."}
{"text":"Simply put, the food is flavourless. Server was kind, place was clean, menu looked ok in theory, prices were reasonable for the description of the food. Got the lamb confit, was the most flavourless and bland meal I've had in months. Nothing against the establishment, but I will not return."}
{"text":"We had brunch at Prohibition GH today. Busy spot on a Sunday, but we were a bit later, so a couple ws finishing up by the window and so we waited.  However, when we went to be seated, two guys at another table had just moved themselves there (really ???!! looks like people really do behave that badly), and we  had to wait instead for another table.  Candidly I did think that the hostess should have told them the table was already taken, I mean they were already at a table and had ordered.  We know, because their beers were delivered to us -- personally I think it should have been the surcharge for the move!  hahaha  Other than this -- the experience was good. Good food - hubby had the steak and eggs and I had the Benny Canard.  We started with a medium order of mini scones.  Food and drink was good, and service was friendly and prompt. We'll probably go back there again - but just a word to the wise -- if you ask for a special table -- make sure you get it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice -- the first time only for drinks, and the second we had food and drinks at the bar.   The vibe and food really, that sets the tone for this place. It was pretty packed both times? They have drink specials after 10pm ... we had the duck poutine. VERY fragrant. black truffle oil? if i'm not mistaken. and a pizza of some sort. very yummy!  Good service at the bar ... nice ladies behind the counters. Will definitely come back if i weren't moving so far away!"}
{"text":"The BEST meal I had in Toronto or a tie to the Roti I had.  We went during their Hooch Hour (5-7pm) to take advantage of the drink and shots specials ($5 drinks and $2 shots). You can't beat this as liquor is so regulated in Toronto. Its a happy hour to visit.  My boyfriend and I split a lot of the food which is mostly made fresh and in-house...down to the dressing. We both got mixed green salads which were good but not the star. The Mac and Cheese was awesome - I like their twist on the cheeses and backed to perfection. The duck fat fries made us order another batch they were so good. I mean its fried in DUCK FAT! The pulled pork grilled cheese was awesome too and comes with a chutney. You can taste the effort they put into their food.  Awesome place for date night or to meet up with friends. It got really packed on a Saturday around 7pm."}
{"text":"I'd been seeing the \"Eat Well Speak Easy\" sign for months before this place opened, so I was certainly quite excited to finally walk through the doors.  We arrived at around 10:00 on a Saturday night and the place was packed, but we were fortunately shown to a table right away.  We were there mainly to drink, but decided to get an order of the Haute Poutine (\"Duck Confit, PQ Curds, DF Frites, Duck Gravy, Demi-Glace, Duck Crackling\") to share.  It's really good, despite the fact that it arrived to the table far from hot. (Why wouldn't they bring it out as soon as it's ready? Baffling.) It's a small-ish dish that's loaded with the aforementioned components, and the duck gravy also gives it a flavor one doesn't usually associate with poutine. The chunks of meat and crackling prove a perfect complement, too.  We liked it so much we actually ordered a second poutine, although without the duck components this time. It arrived hotter, at least, and was indeed quite delicious.  I should also point out the \"hooch hour\" deals are amazing. $5.09 for a pint of beer? Yes, please."}
{"text":"Two stars for frying all their \"frites\" in duck fat and barely having any other vegetarian food on their overpriced menu.   I didn't eat here since my only options were salad or a $16 flatbread. Just had beer which was good, but also overpriced at ~$21 per pitcher. Quite pricy for a place 10 doors down from Jilly's."}
{"text":"was always intrigued of this place when I pass by on the streetcar. Finally decided to try this place out this past summer. Read the reviews and everyone had lots of good things to say.  one of my friends has dietary restrictions and needs to have gluten-free items. When I had called to make the dinner reservation, I had asked and the hostess said, yes, we do have gluten-free items that are not just salads. Just let the server know when you come in.  excited to find another gluten-free place in town, my friends and I show up for the reservation. Upon arrival, the server was really nice and friendly. When we had asked about the gluten-free options, the answer was unfortunately as we do not cook our foods separately, the only gluten-free items are salads. Which was a disppointment to us, as we had specifically asked if there were gluten-free items that weren't salads on the menu.  So we decided to just order a couple of apps and drinks as we have been sitting there for quite some time, and it wasn't the server's fault that there wasn't any gluten-free items (we felt bad to just get up and leave).   In reading the reviews, everyone thought very highly of the mac and cheese and poutine, we had ordered that to try. It wasn't bad, but not sure what the hype was about. Definitely pretty rich and filling and made for sharing!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place.  I have had some really good meals here and some that were inconsistent.    The Good Their Happy Hour is awesome and they offer high quality pours.   The service has always been friendly and professional.   The atmosphere is fun and cozy. The menu options are good and creative.  The Inconsistent The food.  Sometimes it is really good and sometimes not so good.  I have had their burgers, Mac n cheese, flatbreads, etc and for each one, I have had them in really good versions and some where they were really bad.  I recently went there for brunch and had the breakfast poutine.  Probably the most disappointing meal I have had at this place.  The poutine was made up of tater tots that looked like they can out of a McCains bag, three poached eggs which were OK, one cheese curd...and one tiny piece of bacon.  I don't know what makes this a poutine or worth $14.  Wish I could give this place a better rating based on previous experiences here, but the last brunch left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I especially love this place because it is a 5-minute walk from my house!! Now, THAT is quite dangerous! It's been opened for quite a few years now, and if you are looking for a good pub/bar in the neighborhood, then look no further! Perfect for a quick meet-up or a sit-down dinner. Come by yourself, or come with a small group of friends!  I've been here many times, and have brought many people here! Everyone loves it! There are many TVs around the restaurant and even right above some of the booth seats, playing sports games, news, and even retro cartoons! Sometimes they have a live band playing although i'm not quite sure which days. In the summer time, they open their garage-style windows to give you the nice sunny patio feel, but the tables there are usually packed! Definitely a 5 star for atmosphere!  Their menu consists of burgers, wings, nachos, DUCK poutine, to charcuterie, pat√©, lamb sloppy joe, OYSTERS, and one of the best simple mac and cheeses in town!  All their fried foods are fried in duck fat!!! OOOOHHHHH YEAAAAAAA!!!!! Beers on tap range from Rolling Rock to Erdinger to Delirium. Overall, a very good selection! They also carry a wide variety of bottled beers such as corona, heineken, moosehead, red stripe etc.  From what I remember, I've never had a complaint about their food.  The most recent time was last week when I came to grab a drink and a bite just before the Raps game, and this was our \"snack\";  Chicken liver pat√© brul√©e: $9 (3.5/5 stars) I definitely have had better, but this was as good as I can ask for at a pub. It deserved that extra .5 star because it came like a charcuterie platter with dried figs, apricots, honey, some delicious jam-like sauce, toasts! I asked for extra toasts to finish the liver, and I got it!  Mac et fromage: $11 half (4.5/5 stars) As good as any simple mac and cheese out there! Half portion is the perfect portion if you want a snack or a side dish.  It's served in a casserole dish and you just dig into creamy delectable cheesy goodness!  Tatertots: $6?? half (2.5/5 stars) Just like your normal tatertots, but they weren't greasy at all. Best part was that it was served with wasabi aioli!! YUM!  Did I mention they have HOOCH HOUR?!?!?! 4-7pm and again after 10pm!! $5 ANY PINT!!!!! Also, just discovered they just started having $2.50 JAGERS, ALL DAY, EVERYDAY!!!   The only downfall to this place is that if you come at late at night on a weekend, chances are you will not get a seat.  Let's meet for HOOCH HOUR!!!"}
{"text":"Living in the East end, I knew I had to check this place out. We came here for Summerlicious the other day, but unfortunately it's over-rated.   Firstly, the service is great. We were seated quickly to our reserved table and greeted with water.  To start, we order the kalbi ribs and shrimp tostada. Three pieces of kalbi came out on a sizziling plate and I was consumed by the smoke. The ribs ended up a little dry since I couldn't see my plate and all I could taste was burned/burnt soy sauce. Not a great marinade for the ribs.   The shrimp tosada was a bit better. Refreshing shrimp and avocado topped on a fried...thing, I guess. It was difficult to share and eat, but it was good.   For the mains, I got the halibut tacos and my fiance ordered the ribs. I enjoyed the tacos but I found them a bit small. I was quite hungry afterwards, but I think if the tacos came with a side, say fries, I would be fine. I'm not much a rib person, but my fiance liked them. He got 6 ribs where the table near us only got 4 ribs. The cheddar biscuit and coleslaw were really good.   What disappointed me the most was the dessert. I was so looking forward to my New Yorker Chipwich and the Brownie Sundae but none of them really delivered. I assumed the cookie part of my chipwich would be warm, but both cookies were cold, hard and the ice cream just made them colder and harder.   The brownie sundae consisted of a two bite brownie at the bottom, ice cream and whipped cream. A good combination but one you can make at home.   That's all. I don't know. Maybe they didn't impress me solely on their Summerlicious menu. I've heard good things about their brunch and hooch hour, but I'm hesitant to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Old stand by. Love this place. Try the chicken lollipops.   Great place to meet up with friends before heading out to other adventures on an evening in Toronto"}
{"text":"Had a great night there last weekend with cheap shots and some really well done apps.  The atmosphere is nice but the service was a little slow but they were quite busy and worked hard to get us a table and moved when we found we didn't have time to finish up during the time they offered us (we took the chance and agreed to this so it wasn't their fault!).  I'd go back, especially for drinks out in the Queen East area of the city."}
{"text":"Last night my fianc√©e and I went to dinner here. They overcooked my steak and I asked them to make it again. The wait staff were very apologetic and sent it back. These things happen and I thought nothing of it. It took a little time to remake the steak and our waiter comped our whole meal.   Why the 5 star rating? This place not only made sure I was satisfied, they also remade the food and it was delicious. They are polite and professional and a great example of what we look for in the east end. Accidents happen, this place bounced back and made sure we left satisfied. Well done. We will be back."}
{"text":"I find this place hard to rate. It's so many things at once. A local bar, a restaurant and now the first nightclub (well it tries) complete with bouncers and DJ on the weekends. I gets rammed at times and benefits from the fact there's not enough competition in riverside. Local bar hangout 4 out of 5! Lots of TVs, awesome bars and nice staff. Restaurant - I'd say the food was better back in 2010, now it's overpriced and average IMO. 2 out of 5 Really it's a fun place to hang out because it has some size and it's a bit of a who's who place for the neighborhood but there are much better restos in the area."}
{"text":"Prohibition is a solid gastro pub with some decent dishes, good service but nothing particularly memorable. Located in the Riverdale area, Prohibition looks to be a pretty standard pub style restaurant. I don't usually come to this area so I'm not familiar with what's nearby. Service was good with our server checking up on us regularly and bringing us what we needed. In terms of food, we ordered the fish tacos, duck poutine and truffle mac'n'cheese. The fish tacos were sub-par in my opinion and I wouldn't get them again. The duck poutine was tasty but I've had better (I think Bannock does a better one).   The highlight was definitely the truffle mac'n'cheese which I found tasty and cooked well. I'd highly recommend trying that dish.  Overall, I had a positive experience but would be more interested in trying other restaurants in the area rather than visiting again in the near term."}
{"text":"Meh. I came here with friends last night and was very underwhelmed by the food. I had a Cobb salad, the lettuce and tomatoes had seen better days, the chicken wasn't very good (greasy, rotissererie-style meat), and it was very expensive at $17.95. The beer special was a good deal ($5.09 for any beer on tap, between 5PM and 7PM) but I definitely won't be going back here to eat."}
{"text":"After previously saying I wouldn't return here I decided to give it another go, the owner did address my concern which I appreciated. So I came on a Saturday night with a group of friends. Glad I did, as I really like the concept around this place.   I've been back at least 7/8 times in the past 12 months. And it is a good place to go if you feel like a change from run of the mill bars or the craziness of a club. It does be busy and there is a $5 cover for guys on Sat nights. They do really cheap Jagers ($2.50!!), there are a couple of options in the area and imo this is the best place to go. I live in the Beaches but think this it is worth travelling to. It's so close to downtown and the east end. The bouncer on the door is fair and a seems like a good guy which is a nice touch. Definitely a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Prohibition, I reeeeeally did, but I was greatly underwhelmed and generally turned off by the place due to everyone's attitudes.  Our waitress was terrible, hard to hear, and seemed uninterested in her job.  I was not terribly impressed with the food, and in all honesty, for the price of the 25-minute chicken, it warrants a 1 star review.  However, the duck fries were good (with black garlic aioli), and my bf loved his mac & cheese.  The bf claimed that he looooooooved Prohibition, but take it with a grain of salt, as he was 2 beers in on an empty stomach. :P  One last rant: why the heck would you charge male restaurant patrons $5 cover??? I totally understand charging people who come after hours to drink, but if my bf plans on eating, I don't think the $5 cover is necessary.  At all."}
{"text":"Popped in for hooch hour when most drinks were $5.09+tax. I tried the house white and a vodka lemonade. The first one was good and a very good deal considering it's normally priced at $11.50. Much to my disappointment the vodka lemonade was probably the worst I've ever had. It was basically vodka with a loooot of sugar syrup and water with what seems to be artificial lemon flavour. Not at all a lemonade!  If you go for hooch hour you should order beers on tap. But go for the pricier beer options like Delirium or La Fin du Monde. This is where you'll save money. These beers are normally priced at around $9 each so hooch hour really is a good deal. Overall, despite the nasty lemonade it is a good place with awesome prices during hooch hour. Staff is nice and friendly and keeps checking in. Definitely a place worth trying out!"}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday and it was packed! Thank goodness she made reservations (even though there was only the three of us).  I got the open face sloppy Josephine which was lamb shanks in a tomato sauce on top of a focaccia bread with a side of fries. I found it a tad salty (probably coming from the tomato sauce) but it was very delicious and I loved the bread. The fries were also very tasty and crispy.  My friends got the fungi flatbread not knowing there was goat cheese in it. They both hate goat cheese but lucky for them, I love goat cheese and helped them with the dish. Again, I thought that the flatbread was very salty even though my friends thought it was fine. Since I didn't pick out the goat cheese, we discovered that I found it salty because of the cheese.  None of us got the duck fat fries which means that we have to come back here to try it!"}
{"text":"First visit was great. We sat at the bar after work on Thursday. Service was attentive, Great beer selection with couple of tasty appetizers. Second visit was not as great. On Sunday around 4, the place was empty. Service was just horrible. Our server treated us like as we were bothering her every time we asked for things that she forgot to bring. No smile, never checked on us to see if we need anything. We didn't stay long as it was very  uncomfortable to order anything else. I live and work in the neighborhood so it is too bad that I never want to go back."}
{"text":"With this bar, I just can't even. It's supposedly a pub, yet we walked up and were told we had to get on the other side of a rope (there was no one else outside). It did seem full inside, so I figured they were at capacity. However, a couple people walked up who knew the bouncer, and in they went. Another guy came up with a group \"on the list\" and they went in. Honey, this is not Vegas. There should not be a guest list for a pub."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here dancing good times after eats at a pub across the street. So if you're looking for a food review, might want to skip over this one. What I can say about this bar/gastro pub is that it has a little something for everyone. There's a small dance platform for those with dancing feet. There's an array of drinks for the beverage-lovers. And there are small pockets of table for the chatters in your group. The drinks were a decent price and the staff was quick, exactly what is needed for a second buzz."}
{"text":"Duck fat tater tots - amazing! Great place for drinks and apps  Ambience is a bit abrasive, they could lose the TVs for example"}
{"text":"We were in Toronto and wanted to try tradutional, per our Canadian friends inquiry, Canadian food, which turned out to be poutine. Unfortunately, or should I say fortunately, all good places in downtown were already closed, so we went to this bar/pub/restaurant... well, it was phenomenal.  We ordered mushrooms Flatbread,  which I would definitely recommend to any mushrooms lover, and bison burger,  which was finger liking juicy.  Poutine with duck was delicious as well. Overall, great experiance, phenomenal food, and very friendly staff, would surely recommend."}
{"text":"ANY place that you can add Foie Gras to anything, is OK in my books. Not to mention the fact that even without the FOIE the food is still some of the best I have had in my time in Toronto. They offer pretty much everything I love; maybe the best Ceasars I have had, cheap oysters (and a selection), and pub food with an elevated twist... I ask you...WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED??? It is usually very busy in the \"dinner time\" hours...so I recommend a reso if you don't want to wait at the bar, but sometimes its fun to have a drink and some oysters while you wait... I mean you HAD to wait anyways! May as well make the best of it ;)   Great place to hang out with a group of friends or have a date night out.. I can always get down with a place that has duck fat fries, lobster poutine, AMAZING pulled pork sandi and maybe the biggest Nachos serving I have ever seen!!   All I can say is if Prohibition is wrong, I DONT wanna be RIGHT!"}
{"text":"Bad service. We had booked for a party of 12 on a Friday night. When we arrived, we found out that another group who quoted our reservation name was given our table. While they were nice enough to comp our first round, our evening went downhill from there. It took more than thirty minutes to get our drink orders in from the bar and even longer for our food to come out. Our server that night probably shouldn't be in the Industry - as she seemed overwhelmed at the chaos of Friday night service. We had asked her for glasses of water three times, only for it to arrive thirty minutes later. Because our drinks and food were so late, we decided to start ordering drinks at the bar. Our server did not like that - and instead of approaching us with any understandable reason why, she decided to ignore our table altogether. Thankfully, our table was given to another server - Justin - who saved the evening. The food was okay - but coupled with bad service - I can guarantee they lost twelve customers in a span of an hour based on the service they provided."}
{"text":"After being recommended this pub serval times it was time for me to make a visit. My sister and I went for lunch and decided to share a couple of dishes.  The beer was cold and the Caesar delicious.   We were told to order the Mac and Cheese and so we did. I was a little disappointed, it was not very cheesy and quiet flavourless. We also ordered the chicken bites, which were delicious. The fungi flatbread was good. Overall the food was enjoyable, the atmosphere was fun, and the service was good."}
{"text":"So let's get this out of the way-- the menu uses a lot of really fancy words to describe things that aren't too fancy.  But who cares?!  Only negative--it's a little bit pricey.  Food was so good--I especially recommend the foie gras p√¢t√©--not just because it's novel, but super quality and really good!  My fav was the haute poutine--hearty and sohohoho good.  I would happily eat that every day if possible!"}
{"text":"Should I quote The Double by Dostoyevsky here? One side attempt at bygone era cocktail-ing. Other side jaegermeister machines, sports pub with booths. Cheap shots, pricy cocktails. Then I've read that the food can be as chiaroscuro as the images on the wall. I went here two times while posing as an East Ender and they were two contrasting experiences. A midnight excursion felt more like I was in a bar that Canadians would find to be a frustrating typical American experience. Boys were drinking too hard, sloshing their conversations and breaking glasses. While that midnight booth-ing was overall really nice, with attentive service, the music didn't match the sequence. Then, New Year's morning it was a casual, comfortable brunch scene. They had steak & eggs on the menu. And it wasn't a pan-griddle cheap cut, it was a filet. They have tea -- tea type tea, not cold tea -- so if you're not in the mood to drink you can still enjoy their expansive, indulgent menu. Breakfast poutine of tater tots drenched in duck fat gravy & bison belly. And I have a feeling there's a bouncer considering it's next to Jilly's. Sure it's off putting at first, but really that's likely a good idea with what's happening out on that corner. The only corner in my Canadian experience thus far that reminded me of the states. This bar too, in fact. Sometimes, yes, it's not a bad thing!"}
{"text":"It's a regular pub/sports bar and not a gastropub. The food is essentially bar food even though they try to make it sound like its more than that. Please don't get fooled by the name.   We came with no reservations, and told us we could only sit at the bar, even though the rest of the restaurant was empty. It did not fill up by the time we left. Service is also pretty slow and had to put in work just to get the waiter's attention.   The main draw of this place seems to be the cheap drinks during happy hour/late night. Would not come back o this place."}
{"text":"Great Queen East pub! They have a great selection on tap, and great deals on their \"Hooch Hours\"  $2.50 Jager! (dun dun dunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn) I've been her a few times, and the nachos are always great! You can get duck confit on just about everything. Stiegl on tap! :) Tastyyyyy!  Can be a tiny bit loud, but it is a pub. Lots of TV's and pretty quick service. It is great places like this that are helping transform Queen East/Broadview area."}
{"text":"The lobster dip was religion just a tiny portion. The nachos were good also! Good drinks but should add a few more options for cocktails :) overall good."}
{"text":"We came here on their second night after they just opened. They're off to a good start. We have never been to the Queen Street location so this was our first experience with this franchise. The place was surprisingly busy since they told us they haven't even advertised yet. The food was excellent. I had the grilled cheese which was very greasy but quite tasty (8/10). It came with a nice sweet raspberry dipping sauce which i quite liked. My wife had the burger which was too salty but otherwise excellent (8/10). Fries were \"good enough\".. a little soggy, not as crispy as i like, but better than standard pub fries(6/10). I was impressed with the menu! Naturally brewed root beer on tap!? so cool!! unfortunately i couldn't try it because it wasn't delivered yet. Their deserts also were not available at the time we were there. They had an excellent selection of premium beers though. They also had special sparkling water bottles were the proceeds go to wildlife conservation which i thought was pretty neat. bottles were only $1 but i have to say they were not very \"fizzy\" they tasted like Perrier that was sitting out for an hour. Still cheap though and a great cause. The atmosphere was loud but comfortable. Kind of somewhere between a high end pub and standard pub atmosphere. Great place for after work drinks or dinner with friends, professionals and 30 somethings. This place is not cheap! They're obviously targeting mature professionals, but it seemed like good value for what we got. I liked the decor. Reminded me of Union Social Eatery on st. clair. Great place to watch a game as they had a spacious bar with big flat screens above. The service was amazing. They were eager to serve and please as it was their opening weekend. Our server went above and beyond to ensure we were happy. All in all it was a good experience and we would definitely come back to try again. overall (8/10)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Prohibition on and off for quite a few years now.   The best part has always been their gastrohouse concept which meant for people who like good food in a casual pub environment, this was the spot. The ability to add foiegras on to anything was one of the most fun aspects of the menu.   I popped in the other night, and things have changed. With gentrification of the neighbourhood, they're adapting. This means lots of customers and packed weekends, but sadly it's also resulted in the menu not being as great as it once was.   The beer selection is still really good, but what was once an excellent place is now a good place, with a similar value proposition as many places downtown.    Definitely still worth a visit, it's just no longer a planned destination to go to."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my friend on a Thursday night. It was pretty busy when we got there around 7, but we were seated immediately. We wanted sangria but were told they wouldn't have it until summer, which was fine, we got Strongbow ciders. We both split the margherita flatbread which was INCREDIBLE, and a smash burger with fries, also delicious. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! We went there without a reservation thinking we would find space but forgot it was a Habs vs. Penguins game night. Nevertheless the place is very nice, great ambiance and vibe. Mostly yuppie crowd but great place to catch drinks or grab a bite after work. I would highly recommend their home cooked fries, the best I have had."}
{"text":"The patio here is stunning. It's large with greenery all around and the music is great. However, the inside is very dark and makes you feel as though you need to take a nap.   The service is a hit or miss. Unfortunately I've experienced more \"misses\". It tends to be very very slow, which can be displeasing especially during hooch hour (they offer premium bar rail and house wine glasses for 5.09 from 5 pm to 7pm). Sometimes 15 minutes goes by and no one stops by my table. But on the rare occasion the service is great. I wish I got his name, but there is a server there who has shoulder length brown hair who was fast and very helpful. My boyfriend was looking for a different type of beer and the one he suggested was perfect! He was prompt and knowledgeable.  The food is also something I am torn about. I know it is a gastropub, which is probably not the type of place you look for healthy meals anyway. However, I find the dishes so incredibly heavy. I seem to always walk away lethargic. Don't get me wrong, it's always tasty (shout out to the chicken burger and the braised beef), but there are many days I want to go for hooch hour, sit on the patio and enjoy a somewhat light meal. They have salads but the chicken you can add to it is pulled and smothered in barbecue sauce. Maybe I'm picky. Anyway, overall it is so-so."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite pub in Toronto. I've been here many times and it's always a good time. It's totally unpretentious, the staff is super efficient and friendly, the food is excellent and the drinks are cheap (especially if you show up during happy hour). By now I tried most of their food and everything, and I mean everything, is amazing. Whenever I get together with friends or just feel like having a drink, Prohibition is the first place that comes to mind.   I love their duck fat frites, fish tacos, mac & cheese, flatbreads, oh wait...pretty much everything.   If you've never been to Prohibition, you should definitely check it out. It gets busy, especially at night on the weekends (they have a resident dj and it's a party) but during the week or during the day on the weekend, you shouldn't have a problem getting a table. They also take reservations.   Prohibition attracts a good mix of people. On any given day, you'll find here young couples on a date, groups of friends celebrating special occasions (yes, including bachelorette parties and christmas parties), older people kicking it after work, and even babies and toddlers. Everyone is welcome and that's what makes this pub a great place."}
{"text":"Nothing Special.  Duck Confit Poutine, had the texture of braised duck legs.  The Orange Juice is super sweet like its minute maid concentrate.  And to boot $15 dollars for a two ounce glass of Ice Wine that is flat(like it has been opened before, probably for a few days) and served in a champagne glass."}
{"text":"Update to my Prohibition review.  It's still 4 stars, which directly correlates to their proximity to my house and the fact that they stock Innis and Gunn.    Prohibition changes a lot.  Maybe too much, but maybe not.  I think they may have actually settled on their menu now, as it hasn't changed in a while and in the past it would have changed 3 times in the 3 months since Christmas.  Some of my favorite things are gone from the menu, there's something new that I like, the hashbrowns are different every time I eat them and they are carrying Delerium on draught right now.   The things I miss from various old menus: a) DUCK FAT FRIES. These were the greatest and used to come with a trio of sauces including a curried ketchup that I was in love with.  Zack S and I enjoyed them on a number of great nights at Prohibition... they were kind of our go-to snack food for the east side.  I sort of understand why the fries had to change - it's expensive to use duck fat and it's not vegetarian friendly (and their new fries ARE very good) but I wish the curried ketchup was still on the menu. b) There was a chicken wrap that was kind of like a very chunky chicken salad.  It used to be my lunchtime go-to item.    The things I like on the new menu: a) Buckingham Blanket.  This is a yorkie flatbread wrapped around roast beef and arugula with wasabi mayo and jus for dipping.  This is either amazing or terrible on a given day.  If you have it later in the night the beef is less rare and the jus is reheated and thick.  If you have it earlier in the day it's usually better.  This is a great sandwich and a good addition to the menu. b) Chicken Fried Ribs.  Another good new item.  The staff: The guy who works the bar is awesome.  He brought me a beer before I even ordered it the other day.  He is friendly, composed when it's busy and has great beer picks when I say surprise me.  The cook is a jerk. I won't go into details, but don't try to talk to him (even if he talks to you, because he will just walk away in the middle of your conversation.)  Anyways - if you are reading this, what I was going to tell you before you rudely walked away from me was that the 'final iteration' of the hashbrowns were really nicely seasoned and I applaud the use of the potato ricer but I wish there was a crispy outer layer.  But whatever, you obviously don't care what the customers think because you're back there making art or some bullshit.  The manager is always there and drinking at the bar and he's hilarious and has great hair.  He is always surrounded by cougars and I am slightly in awe of his magnetism.  There is also am amazing girl who works here that once yelled at a vagrant who was passing by through the garage door style window.  \"Be on you way Sir!\" she hollered.  Overall, Prohibition hangs onto it's 4 star rating.  It's a trustworthy food source in my neighbourhood, I love the ambiance and they have good taps.  Bonus points for the speakers corner video booth in the basement that has never worked once when I have been there."}
{"text":"In agreement to post from Kat F. (below), the vegetarian options are meager and the menu is pricey.   Despite these unfortunate flaws, I have to admit this is a cute spot to come and have a drink or two with some friends- particularly if you are an oyster fan. Apparently they have an oyster bar? It was not functioning whilst I was in present, but everybody seemed to be very excited about it.   The poutine dish was also quite nice... Albeit, I had removed both the duck and the duck gravy, so really it was just french fries with cheese drenched in some red-wine sauce... but they were very accomadating in my asking for such a complete removal of the main ingredient in the dish... Which was nice.  The decor is also kind of cute. It's like an upper scale dive bar. Oysters and fancy drinks but a rather 'ripped jeans' and 'greasy hair' feel to it: very laid back.   I probably wouldn't suggest going out of your way to come here, but if you are in the area and are looking for a place to go to hang out for a drink, it's a nifty little spot to stop in on."}
{"text":"The duck poutine is amazing!! Excellent beer selection too!  Unfortunately service is \"just okay\". Staff seem friendly but distracted, don't know their menu well enough to give advice on gluten free options, but decent advice for beer selections. We had to wait quite a while for service when we went with a group (of 6) sitting at a table. Got much better service when I we went as a couple and sat at the bar, even though it was busier and during a Jay's game."}
{"text":"Truffle mac n cheese was awesome.  Pastrami on a Caesar salad??  I still prefer bacon. Crab cake sliders were excellent"}
{"text":"Service was simply amazing. We were taken care of and checked up on frequently! Our waiter was super friendly and established a positive rapport with us easily.   The ambience was quite comfortable and inviting. I felt like I could easily sit there for the entire evening and chat away with my friends!  The one negative was some of the food. My friends and I all ordered the flaming Greek burger. We all enjoyed the burger, it had the right combination of textures and flavours. But what I did not like was my side, which was the soup of the day. Now, I can't remember exactly what it was, I think a jerk chicken soup, but it did not taste good at all. It was really salty! I couldn't even finish it.   Overall however, we had a great experience and would return again."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. It was the hostess' first day and she was so happy. I love going places and seeing happy employees!  A friend and I came here after spinning nearby. After the torture session we wanted to reward ourselves. No better way than regaining all our lost calories!  We split an order of fries. They were fried in duck fat! Wow! Impressed. We got black garlic aioli on the side ($1). There wasn't enough aioli to fries ratio but the aioli was tasty.   We got Mac and cheese, which had several types of cheese on it. It was delicious!  Next up was the bison burger with a side salad. The salad was fresh tasting. The dressing was a bit sweet but it was still pretty good. The burger itself was delicious. We were able to order it medium rare, which was great. Most places require that the burger is cooked to a specific internal temperature, essentially destroying the meat, but if the restaurant grinds the meat themselves (from my understanding), that rule doesn't apply. It really makes a difference!  The servings were a good size. There were leftover fries and Mac and cheese, which we had no problem taking home. Both were still good the next day.   This place is not like any other pub. Most pubs don't fry their frites in duck fat (expensive), use freshly ground bison meat for their burgers (not already-ground beef), and they have fancy condiments (it's the little things). At the table they also have Himalayan salt grinders, one plain and one with black peppercorn. Definitely not your average iodized salt and tasteless black pepper shaker! I think this place was priced fairly for what it offered. The people complaining about price probably don't value or notice higher quality things and would be just as happy going to the Firkin.   Although, interesting to note, they appear to have rebranded themselves. Before I wouldn't have even thought of going in with the giant BOOZE \"stamped\" on their sign. It just screamed \"trashy bar\" to me. Maybe the people coming in and complaining about prices wanted a dive bar. Their rebranding definitely changed my mind about them and I'm glad I tried them out! From dive bar to gastrohouse... Awesome!"}
{"text":"Saturday brunch (after a long night of drinking) is a must on a cold Toronto morning!   Mind you, the smell of last night's beer still lingers and some of the 'tenders look like they've on a bender of their own, but it's good solid food and booze for your first meal.  I've been told that the Caesars (aka Bloody Mary) here are excellent, but I went straight for a Sprite. Gotta calm down that fussy tummy after about a gallon of wine and spirits from the previous evening.  Hearty menu items include duck confit poutine as well as duck fat tots (YUM!), Mexican waffle and a huge breakfast burrito. Just enough to coat the inner linings of your stomach and make way for an afternoon nap.  Please note: No sleeping allowed in the booths. One of our companions had to excuse herself from the table in favor of a snooze. Understandable that it's not legal to let patrons get too cozy inside."}
{"text":"Came for a weekday lunch. Food was tasty but service was crazy slow. Over 90 mins for lunch and it wasn't all that busy. Not that great when you need to get back to the office!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service here!  Went here for lunch with my boyfriend. I had the duck poutine, and my partner had the pulled pork grilled cheese. Both were very tasty! Would come back for the pulled pork grilled cheese and the dip they provided with it."}
{"text":"It was a rainy day in Leslieville, and I was surprisingly starving after the Leslie Food & Drink Festival (it was majorly lacking food/overpriced ... but that's another story).  My friend suggested we go to Prohibition, and I'm really glad she did! Their truffle Mac & cheese is sinfully good - the perfect meal for gloomy weather or any other occasion really :)."}
{"text":"Amazing place! My co-workers and I went here on. Saturday to celebrate a postpartum baby shower. I showed up late so didn't end up ordering food but i tried my friend's food.  The Nachos were delicious! Served in a baking pan with sour cream and salsa on the side; and even though it was basic nachos (veggies and cheese), it was probably the best I had - they didn't try to mess up a good thing by adding extra toppings. Huge portion too!   The drinks were so affordable! Hooch hour starts after 10pm so all shots were 2$ each and 5$ bar rails! I like the fact that the end of the restaurant turns into a dance floor after maybe 11pm if memory serves me right and they played awesome music the night I was there.   The best thing about this place, in my opinion, is that there's a mini bar attached to the dance floor with the main bar being so close and is the centre of the restaurant. Would highly recommend this place if you're not into the club scene but want to go to a place with good food and great music"}
{"text":"Food was really nice except for some scalloped potatoes that arrived cold. Attentive waitress (who was unfortunately busy with the large crowd) and a nice selection of interesting food."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab dinner before the Cirque du Soleil performance of \"Totem\".  The options in the Distillery District looked dismal so we had to broaden our search.  I called Prohibition for last minute reservations not knowing if the place would be swamped on a Friday night.  Was greeted very politely and enthusiastically by person on the other end of the line.  Actually made me look forward to good things to come.  We arrived around 6pm to find a booth already awaiting us.  Our server dropped off menus and informed us that we were in time for \"Hooch Hour\" where all pints and a few glasses of house wine were $5.  It's a deal too good to turn down so we ordered pints of Cracked Canoe, Wellington Ale and Spearhead Hawaiian.  For mains, I went with the bison burger ($16). Others ordered the pulled pork sandwich ($14), Buckingham Blanket ($14) and the 25-minute Poulet ($19).  We were warned that the poulet would actually take 25-minutes to prepare so we went with an appetizer - prosciutto platter ($18).  The prosciutto was served on a wooden board accompanied by a small warm loaf of bread with olive oil and balsamic, a selection of berries/figs/apricots, salted almonds, pickles and mustard.  A really great start.  Mains took a bit long to arrive, and even though we were warned about the 25 min. wait, it did take a bit longer, although not a huge problem.  We all enjoyed our mains with the 25-min Poulet being the highlight.  It consisted of 2 breaded chicken breasts, a side of sweet potato casserole, jalapeno cornbread and coleslaw.  It was a portion that 2 people could have shared.  Prices at Prohibition are a bit higher than the average pub but most of the entree sizes are pretty substantial and enough that two people could share, along with an appetizer.  As others have stated, the wine pours looked small but the draft selection is good so stick with beer.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  Our server reminded me of a young Fred Savage (\"What would you do if I sang out of tune...\").  A big fan of the Hooch Hour, I'll most likely be back for drinks and apps.  My fear of the East end is slowly subsiding."}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2016  Shrimp tostadas: great flavour and received a pleasant surprise when I lifted the tostada to discover a dollop of guac underneath.   Beef Short Ribs: great sauce plus meat was done just right. The biscuit was crispy and flavourful but not overwhelmingly cheesy. I also tried the Mac n cheese which had too much of a blue cheese taste. It lingered for far too long...inside me.   Brownie dessert with icecream was comfortingly nice. Couldn't finish it.   Unfortunately the speed of service declined noticeably through the course of the evening. Which I didn't expect from a winterlicious dinner. There was a long drag between main and dessert, when the place wasn't even full. When I asked a server about it, he said \"I just saw them putting out a bunch of desserts in the kitchen\". It came across like something you tell an impatient child to shush them."}
{"text":"Came here for the summerlicious menu for dinner and it was pretty good!   For the appetizer, I ordered the shrimp tostado. It was like guacamole on a large tortilla chip. The flavours went really well together, but it was a hard tortilla chip to bite through!   For the main, I got the truffle Mac n cheese, it smelled and tasted pretty yummy! Although it was a strong and distinct flavour, I really enjoyed it!   Lastly, the dessert was a little disappointing. I ordered the cheesecake and it wasn't anything special - almost tasted store bought.   All in all, the service, atmosphere and food were good, but was lacking in the dessert dish!"}
{"text":"Great place if you're hungry. Doesn't brake the bank and will leave you full upon leaving the venue. We decided to be adventurous and tried their oysters. They were around $3.25 - $4.00 each. Can't recall the last time I tried oysters, but it was an interesting experience. I liked the East Coast oysters, while the West Coast oysters were small and didn't taste as well as the East Coast ones. Their pulled duck fries with gravy and cheese would nicely complement an main (e.g. chicken, stake, etc.) and you can share them, because even the medium portion is good for 2 people. The atmosphere is more of a local pub than a classy restaurant. I would surely come back to sample some more oysters or try a different item on the menu."}
{"text":"Prohibition seems kind of overrated.  I was optimistic upon arrival, since it happened to be HAPPY HOUR and they had house wine and a large variety of pints for $5. We also scored a very nice table overlooking the beautiful Queen and Broadview area...  The server gave me the smallest glass of wine I've ever seen, $5 indeed!  I didn't order any food because I'm CHEAP and it looked fairly rip off. Did you know you can order nachos here for FORTY SEVEN dollars?!?! (Large nachos with chicken added) Those have better be good!  My friends ate a bison burger with fries ($15 - not too bad I suppose) and 3 chicken wings for $9. THREE chicken wings (drumstick only) for NINE dollars...but they did look pretty and had parsley sprinkled overtop.  The service was OK and the pub interior was nice. Plus, their logo has a centaur on it. So that's cool."}
{"text":"Place was packed and the atmosphere was great .First I ordered the salad and the dressing was discussing then I ordered the smash burger and it was already a little bland but flavorful at the same time kind a like if you were to make a burger yourself from scratch. It was crispy on the outside tender on the inside and juicy I don't know how they did it but they made mine medium I loved it!  Restaurant I give a five out of five Food I give a four out of five Waitress I give a -0 out of five  Now for the bad part I Kinda seeing that the waitress was going to reach over the food so I hinted to her to go around and she did but then she had to come back to leave me my food but she didn't come back she put her hand over the person food that was I was dining with and I I thought her I've had touch the plate of food though the person I was dining with had said no it was just about very very close also they served my drink in a rocks glass instead of a flute who drinks Chardonnay out of a rocks glass I have studied in bartending and the first thing you learn is the glass types."}
{"text":"The waiter with the man bun and the hostess with the curly hair hate their job and it's obvious. Their attitude makes the atmosphere so unwelcoming and uncomfortable. We wanted to have a good night and spend a lot of money, but we essentially were told to leave because we had a large party even after we were told we could drink at the bar.  P.S. The male waiter shoved a member of our party. The polite thing to do is to say \"excuse me\". PLEASE DON'T SHOVE HUMANS."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood but first time at Prohibition Gastrohouse, and it won't be my last!  Our experience was great, I reserved a table Friday late afternoon for 6:45pm on the same day because we wanted to take advantage of their hooch hour ($5.09 drink btw 5-7pm and 10-11pm). It worked out for us, and reservation was for 4 adults. As the evening went by, another friend joined us, the waitress was very accommodating and moved us to another table for 5.  We had their nachos platter for 2, smash burger, Mac and cheese with truffles and bacon, and baked Alaska. I personally had the nachos with pulled pork and it was pretty awesome but greasy. It was a huge tray so by the end the pulled pork was a bit dry. The baked Alaska was good, and the bottom layer was more like fudge than brownie.   Overall we really enjoyed the hooch hour, the service and the food!"}
{"text":"The food is decent but the prices are not. You pay about 50% more than you should for the quality. Flavor-wise, nothing was really worth it. Just your average pub fare at inflated prices."}
{"text":"It is always the greatest spot to end a work week, been here few times now and it's been great. Orders comes in late sometime because they are super busy"}
{"text":"The service was excellent; prompt, friendly and fast without being overbearing.  Happy, pleasant people all around.  The brunch menu was full of great choices.  I went for the Breakfast Poutine and was not disappointed at all.  Generous with three poached eggs and tater tots.  Who doesn't love tater tots?!?!  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for whenever someone comes over from another village because you can take your crazy OCD relatives or your embarrassing friends you haven't seen since high school and they will be comfortable (big screen tv's, beers!) or impressed (sleek decor, duck frites!)  There's a diverse menu, altho don't ask me about the needs of vegans or the gluten-free champions of this world as I am not their voice, but I have taken small children and old people there and everyone has been happy.  I met a blind date there once and while it awkward at first, things got rolling over some lollipop chicken drum sticks.  These are Prohibition's enchanting version of wings, they roll the drumstick meat up in a ball and it looks like a delicious lollipop. They were HOT (as in spicy) and I said \"I'm going to have a burning ring of  fire tomorrow!\"  He said, \"Well I can put that out for you!\" And we laughed and had some Jagermeister shots and then things got blurry after that.  Although I woke up the next morning at home in my own bed, alone, I checked the timeline on my Instagram and there was a #selfie of me with an entire lollipop drumstick in my mouth, at least I think it was a drumstick.  Good times."}
{"text":"Been here for brunch, dinner and drinks, and winterlicious. Each time good experience.  The food isn't outstanding, and they have some misses, but overall very good, and some cool menu choices.  My faves are the breakfast poutine, duck eggs benny, normal poutine, mac and cheese, duck fat tater tots (must get!) and inside out pulled pork grilled cheese (you can see all not healthy lol)  Service has always been great and they take resos which I love.   Great beer selection and great vibe and crowd. Super fun place to head for drinks in the evening!"}
{"text":"This is a late crowd but guaranteed not to disappoint. Go see Manning and you will have a great experience."}
{"text":"Love the food. It's a bit overpriced for a pub. It's not UPSCALE, but it is nicer than the average brewhouse. Get the Beef Ribs if you're real hungry.   One great thing is that they do have \"Happy Hour\" at certain times, which so many places have done away with."}
{"text":"So happy we discovered this place this morning. Quaint interior, pleasant and helpful staff and so accommodating for my celiac. Enjoyed a delicious capaccino along with a Gluten free prepared mac and cheese! ( changed pasta and topping to accommodate) portion size was perfect as I couldn't finish it all.  Big open front window allowing a breeze and to hear the sounds of Queen street. Music playing in the background was pleasant and perfect level for still allowing conversation.  If and when we return to Toronto from our home in the west I would definitely return to this location!!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend. I think they do shot specials from 10-11 pm. Like $2.50 shots and $5 beers. It was a great filler for the night if you're hitting a few places."}
{"text":"My first experience about two months ago was pretty good, but last night's was less than good so the balance of the two is 3 stars. Last night the drinks were slow to come like what you would expect on a Friday or Saturday night when the place is slammed, not on a Wednesday night when the place is empty. Since we were a larger group it was an awkward situation with some people being relegated to the side tables away from the main table the majority of people were at.   I don't really think I would make this a regular place of mine and I definitely don't understand all the hype from friends and other Yelpers."}
{"text":"Delishhhhh.  Stopped by Prohibition for a quick lunch after a quick appointment. What a treat.   Hadn't been here in a while. Ordered the duck confit poutine and it was amazing. Frankly I've had one better (in Chicago) and it was short on salt (IMO) but this place is still amazing. The menu has lots to offer so check out this Leslieville staple.   Made me miss the old 'hood something fierce!    I recommend: trying some kind of poutine. Any kind.   Extra tip: make a reservation if you want a booth."}
{"text":"Happy Hour from 4 pm to 7 pm everyday for $5 a pint?   I would not complain too much if I am at Prohibition during their happy hour. Their draft choice during their Happy Hour is awesome.   However, being a gastropub, Prohibition really not good enough.   I was really hungry and when I need food when I drink my beer, so I forced my Yelp Drinking Buddy to order some food to share with me!   The Bison Burger with fries ($15) I found it A-OK.. didn't wow me but when I am hungry I am easy! The fries are seasoned with sea salt which is a nice touch.... Chicken Lollipops ($9) for sure is a little disappointing! I think I need 10 of those in order to satisfy me... they are quite tasty for just so mini...mini drumsticks!   Services here is so slow....... Waiter took forever to take our order!! Drinks took forever to arrive and so were the food. Maybe I just hungry??   I don't mind coming to Prohibition for their Happy Hour but the area just creep me out when it is dark outside.......and I would have just order a drink with no food.....and definitely NOT those lollipops!"}
{"text":"Burger was excellent and Mac and cheese was quite good, however, a tad more expensive than your regular pub or bar."}
{"text":"If duck, duck fat and truffle oil means you can charge $30 for 10 nachos and call it gourmet, enjoy! One meal was enough for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic duck poutine. Actually all appetizer/entrees we had were fantastic! Many different kinds of beer. Music a little bit loud but nice place"}
{"text":"I've always had a good time at this place. The food is decent and a cut above regular pub fare, and I have no compunction about getting totally sloshed here. The layout is a bit schizophrenic: restaurant to the right, expansive bar to the left, but they pull it off well. I was wary of their ability to showcase live music when I was there Saturday night but it was a success.  Obligatory Title Pun: More like: prohi-BITCHIN'!  Menu Readability: They changed it from a broadsheet to a book, but it's still all right.  Even though it's not a franchise, everything has a polished corporate look about it.    Need to mention: Music was excruciatingly loud in the back room where we sat.  Management did not let up until the problem was fixed. Kudos!  What this place teaches me about myself: I'm secretly in love with downtown's East End."}
{"text":"Just opened near my house . Nice decor , decent prices , service abit slow. Well come back soon"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.  Fruit flies everywhere.  Restroom in need of maintenance and cleaning.  I was a chef for many years and I wouldn't make my worst enemy eat here.  Add to this the owner treats his employees like trash and I saw him go into a fit with one girl that should have resulted in an assault charge.  I don't see this place lasting long with the new ownership.  Don't waste your time or money.  Too many great bars and restaurants in this neighbourhood to bother with Prohibition."}
{"text":"The service was excellent but the food, and the psychotic presentation of it were awful.  My gfriend and I both ordered the 25 minute chicken - it took 44 minutes and the plates were actually cutting boards that almost covered our entire table, leaving just enough room for our 2 drinks.  Service: 5/5 Meal: 0/5"}
{"text":"Dear Prohibition,  Please stop completely revolutionizing your menu at such feverish intervals. The vitamin D fortified soy milk in my fridge lasts longer than an average entree on the menu here. With every new menu pressing, the list of vegetarian options dwindles and the prices go up (it's not a good look). The current incarnation of the \"aged\" (yeah right) grilled cheese has so little flavour that it belongs on a BRAT diet meal plan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAT_diet).  Thanks, Kat F"}
{"text":"I celebrated a friend's birthday at Prohibition Gastrohouse  One friend had the open-faced sloppy jos√©phine ($15) - duck fat confit lamb shank, spicy antipasto-aioli, shredded iceberg and focaccia. She particularly liked the bread. Unfortunately, I didn't try any of it because of my dislike for lamb.   The bday girl and I shared two things- the first being the funghi flatbread ($17) with woodland mushrooms, ch√®vre noir, grand chevalier ch√®vre, garlic paste, truffle oil, caramelized onion and fresh thyme. This came highly recommended by her co-worker, but unfortunately, neither of us read the description properly. It turned out that ch√®vre was French for goat cheese, something that both of us hated! Anyway, we tried our best to pick off all the cheese, but despite our best efforts, we still weren't able to.   We also shared the Buckingham blanket ($14)- rare flank steak, arugula, caramelized onions, wasabi-aioli, Yorkshire wrap and red-wine jus. I was intrigued by the concept of a Yorkshire wrap, but was somewhat disappointed that it was pretty much like a regular pita. The filling was nice, but the flavours were a little one-note. I wished the caramelized onions were sweeter. That said, I did enjoy dipping my sandwich into the red wine jus. The side of fries was pretty good and we pretty much finished it all.   On the whole, I thought the food here was decent, but nothing really wowed me. But to be fair, I can't really give a sound assessment because the only thing I could judge was the Buckingham blanket. In the future, I'll be more careful about ordering things with goat cheese."}
{"text":"Had a birthday party at this location and to be honest I wasn't expecting much. However, this place was a pleasant surprise. The staff here are very friendly and kept checking up on our table (I believe there was over 20 of us). We had an amazing seat by the open portion of the restaurant so we had plenty of fresh air coming in. After 11 they have a DJ playing very random music (dance/hip hop/ throw backs), but there was a lot of space to get your dance on. The only thing that sucks about this place is the area it's located in. It gets really sketchy in the evening and like 90% of the people walking by were asking for change."}
{"text":"My favourite pub in T.O! The staff are welcoming and the menu is very well crafted. I could eat their chicken tacos and bison chili all day, every day."}
{"text":"My 'local'.  Great staff who work hard and are really friendly.  Nice place to watch the game or hang out by the huge garage doors open in the summer making it feel like a covered patio!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and great deals on drinks. 2.5 for jack honey and jagger all day and $5 happy hour. The food is pricier but quite good.. although a little greasy. The service is almost always super slow. I waited for 20 minutes for a drink and they weren't busy. But I continue going back here because overall it's good."}
{"text":"Had brunch here today and the service was horrible. Our server forgot an order, was missing for 90% of the time and took forever to come by when the restaurant wasn't busy in the slightest. The food was mediocre, I had the Duck Benny and the biscuit was quite hard/dry.   Listen to the other reviews on their page, this place is blah."}
{"text":"Upscale pub spot with a beer selection that leans more to quality than quantity.  Comfortable high chairs and spacious ambience.  Over sized appetizers, especially the meatball sliders.  Typical selection of pub mains with a few extras.  The r√∂sti is well done and and nicely dressed.   Not a cheap spot to have a drink, but overall a good meal with a lounge-type vibe."}
{"text":"Not much was open on Boxing Day in the east end, but I was out of Christmas wine. Ah oh! Ah oh! Sound the alarm!   Fewf. PG was open it's usual hours, until 2am. Double fewf.   I'm sure the food is just as solid as I mentioned in my previous reviews, but something ugly happens here after dark these days. There is a bouncer. There are frat boys everywhere. The music is top 40 and far too loud. Any signs of sophisticated life appear to have disappeared into the cold Leslieville air, leaving me in some twisted hell.   PEPPER'S PISSED: Sick jager bomb, brah."}
{"text":"Prohibition, I want to REALLY LIKE YOU. But you continue to underwhelm me. I really, REALLY love your hooch hours because you have a great draught beer selection and cheap tennessee honey jack daniels but your food consistently underwhelms me. I've been here a handful of times and tried something different every time. Alas most dishes are overly salty, which is the quickest way to ruin a dish and to make me really salty. Pun intended. Most recently I had a chicken sandwich which was fairly tasty and things are going well except there were actual bones in my sandwich. I don't know about everyone else, but usually a chicken sandwich is a made with a chicken breast which is boneless to avoid someone choking. i digress. I like the nibbles here while I indulge in some of my favorite brews. But I have yet to be floored by amazingness on the culinary side. Keep trying, PH. I'm rooting for ya.  **PS** Yes this place transforms after 10pm usually on the weekends to dancing in the back. it's a weird mixture of people but less clubby than elsewhere and some Top 40 tunes and guilty pleasures to amuse you!"}
{"text":"Delicious drinks and food - especially the grilled cheese. Good service too."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for a while now and I just love the resurgence of decent eating/night life establishments along Queen St. E. The Booze Emporium looked like it could become a regular hang-out spot, so we stopped in for dinner to check it out for ourselves.   I don't know if I just have high expectations, but I was pretty disappointing with the menu and with the food, itself. The advertise themselves as a \"GastroPub\", which, according to Wikipedia, is a British term for a public house which specializes in high-quality food a step above the more basic \"pub grub.\"   The food was anything but high-quality, quite pedestrian actually!"}
{"text":"1. They serve delirium beer here, huge plus. 2. Food is fantastic, when my brother comes to visit it's our go-to place 3. Service is great, but better to go earlier in the day and get a window seat :)"}
{"text":"I need to come back here on a night where they don't have a lineup outside to make it look SUPER KEWL (and there's still tons of room inside). I mean where even were we?  I just remember taking the streetcar there for awhile.  That aside, I really liked it in there. I also really liked the cheap shots, and the blaring top 40.    I didn't eat anything, so my review is sort of invalid in that regard.  But I did look like a total idiot on the dance floor by myself, swaying back and forth and doing a weird floor-stomp, and I know people were staring at me but yet I still felt welcome in there.  How can you go wrong with that?  I was even one of those annoying people that wanders around the bar holding out their phone trying to get reception, and one of the bouncers even joked about it with me instead of just glaring.  Solid!  We had to leave because the rest of our group was being forced to wait outside, so we went down to the street to Rasputin.  Crappier music, but they let us all in."}
{"text":"after waiting almost 5 months to check out this place, I decided it would be an excellent place to try out for my S/O and my 2nd year anniversary. when we got into the area, we had to walk through about 4-5 smokers hanging out under the canopy avoiding the rain. inside we were quickly brought over to this two seated table right beside the staircase to go down into the basement\bathroom area. I wasn't impressed with this because of the spacing I had to pull out the table and chairs to give us enough room to sit down, and accommodate the people around us, plus the music is very loud, to the point, I couldn't talk to my s/o!. we were greeted by our server who recommended the drink menu to start us off, and then just disappeared, I couldn't help but notice the drink menu having \"all day, everyday party shots\" for a steal at $2.43 a shot(jager or JD honey) which I thought was a pretty good deal, and it is, especially when you see the other shots on the menu ranging from 5-7 bucks, all the way up to 28.41 for a portion of specialty whiskey(I really wish I got a photo with that/I say portion because it wasn't clearly outlined what size the shot would be showing up as) what made this even more jaw dropping was the fact that this item had a blue crown beside it...I looked on our table and noticed a blue crown with a sign attached to it, which basically said premium drinks at an extra charge, ok so we didn't come in at hooch hour, I get it, but this menu was insane. 14.21 for a portion of grey goose? highway robbery. my s.o and I decided to just stick to water. and we began to look over the food menu. now from the very get-go I had my heart set out on the duck poutine, so I knew I was having that, but there were other items on the menu, so I figured I would give it a once over. what really puzzled me was the fish section of the menu, none of the items had pricing, the only thing it said was \"price based on daily market share\" I took this from a very stand offish point, almost like saying \"we don't know the price, neither do you...so don't order it ok?\" the other thing to the menu that made me shake my head was the additions you could have on anything and everything, extra bacon, a cheese sauce(7 bucks!) and if you told the server to \"FG it\":, you would get some foie gras on everything. when the waitress decided to grace us with her presence, I honestly wasn't done looking at the menu/decided on anything, so she came around to ask us if we wanted drinks, to which we both replied water is fine, within about 2 seconds of the words leaving our mouth, I felt like a switch just turned off in her head, any smile, happiness, or general eagerness to provide a good service just shut down completely. fast forward 10 minutes later, we had ordered our food to a robot of a waitress, honestly it was like us not ordering drinks just sucked all the life out of her completely. it took about 15 minutes for our app's to come, once we were finished it took 20+ minutes for our mains to come...after finishing our app's? unacceptable on so many levels, to further the level of frustration even more, this waitress was serving all of the tables in my view, at the time there was 3 other tables that were sat within minutes of our initial sitting, given drinks, app's and even there mains, before we got ours. it felt like this waitress was playing favorites, even worse was the fact that our app's and our mains were brought to our table...by someone other then our waitress...? now if you've read this far down, surely we can agree that this doesn't make any sense. our food was very small in portion size, which was very frustrating when it came to the price of the items on the menu. ah the duck poutine, the absolute gem of the night, the reason why I wanted to come here in the first place...oh wait...its nothing special. lack of sauce, the sauce tastes like its packaged from a store, and the actual meat was very small in size. by the time the end of the meal was near, I was at my boiling point, having dealt with this table is an awkward spot of the restaurant, with people being completely inebriated bumping into my arm, while im trying to celebrate and/or eat. the washroom is also super tiny, and the faucets are broken? I quickly got ahold of the waiter after coming back up, who brought our food, not the original waitress, paid, was brought an ipad mini to fill out a survey, which I wanted nothing to do with, from the germ factor alone, we got out as soon as we could. no thank you from anyone, no have a good night, no thank you...nothing.  The ambience is a really nice touch to this place, but the service is some of the worst I have received.  this restaurant has the motto of eat well...speak easy, this restaurant doesn't deliver on either, as it will eat a hole in you're money. and its impossible to speak easy with the music cranked up as high as it is. avoid this place at all cost. over priced, under flavored, horrible service."}
{"text":"Another stop on our beer tour with our friends from Toronto.  We stopped in at Prohibition on a Tuesday afternoon and they had half the restaurant closed.  We had to sit at the back by the chef's prep station.   It was somewhat cool to watch the chef's prepping food, but also sort of awkward for seating.  We didn't order any food here, but I had a Delirium beer which came in its specific glass.   Overall I enjoyed the dark ambiance of the place, and the decor.  Compared to some \"gastro\" places I've been too the beer selection was not varied enough."}
{"text":"Good is decent but not amazing. Outside patio is fantastic in the warmer seasons. Service at night is not always great although have been for lunch many times and it's always great then! A decent casual place to go. Decent value overall."}
{"text":"Substantial chicken lollipops (drumsticks, not wings)-- four more than enough for average person. Good sweet potato fries.  Pleasant service."}
