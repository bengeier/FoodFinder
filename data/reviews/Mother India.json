{"text":"WOW!  The butter chicken roti is by far the best in the city!!  I've been ordering from Mother India for years and I'm never disappointed.  I would never dine-in because the restaurant has a lot to be desired, but the food they pump out of that small kitchen is what dreams are made of.  Just Eat and Uber delivers...that's the only way to experience the awesomeness of Mother India's butter chicken rotis!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Parkdale.  The lamb roti is delicious. Most people seem to enjoy it as a take - out restaurant so it is easy to grab a table at almost any time.  The staff is willing to give friendly advice without making you feel like an outsider."}
{"text":"I've reviewed Gandhi Roti before and they really are the same quality. The butter chicken is just incredible (note I don't usually order butter chicken at a regular Indian restuarant but in a roti and when they deliver some spice it is perfection).

We usually call ahead and it's ready when we get there (approx 20min). The samosas are probably the best I've had in the city (on par with Trimurti) and I love the tamarind sauce they serve alongside. 

Last time my husband ordered his usual chicken vindaloo (delicious) but also tacked on a chicken biryani for us to try and have for leftovers. He is a biryani aficionado and thought this was the best he's ever had. It came with a strange yogurt sauce (perhaps their version of raita?) but we didn't like it at all. Luckily the biryani was fantastic on it's own.

*Note: I don't think Gandhi offers biryani

Final verdict: with Gandhi or Mother India you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I love Ghandi and I love Mother India. The first time I went in it seemed oddly familiar so I asked the guy behind the counter and he confirmed it was in fact the same owners of Ghandi... He told me that if I want my roti exactly like Ghandi, I just have to ask; apparently they tone down the spice a little at this location.

It's always butter chicken or saag paneer for me; I've been to this location about a dozen times now and it's just as good as Ghandi, but much more exciting since it's in my 'hood!"}
{"text":"So delicious.  I even managed to convert or at least open up the possibilities for my caribbean roti loving boyfriend.  We ordered the chicken roti, saag paneer roti and the butter chicken roti.  All was right with the world. It was spicy and tasty at the same time.  Bonus, we ordered enough to have leftovers to freeze.  FYI, the leftovers thaw nicely and are still super tasty!  
We too experienced no line and the server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Price point is on point. Takes me back to Asia in one bite. The rotis (both meat and veg) are scrumptious, as is the pakora, as is the masala chaiiiiii.... Mmmmmmmm......"}
{"text":"Oooh yeah, I have to give Ghandi Cuisine the big F U right now!  

:P  j/k... I still respect you, Ghandi.  It's just you are so hard to access by car.. your seating area is so tiny.. and you serve everyone in a tin foil box, even if you are dining in.

Mother India is a legit restaurant, with menu, server, water, steel cutlery, washroom and space for several tables.  I did not get to try the Butter Chicken Roti when I was at Ghandi last time, but went for it here based on strong Yelp recommendations, and I was not disappointed.

Was it the best butter chicken that I have had?  Mmm... not really.  That title would belong to Babur.  But I am knit picking here, because it was still very deeelish.  

And yeah, all the other compliments that went out to Ghandi goes here too--perfect level of spiciness (I had medium, and it was exactly that, medium level of heat), texture, dirt cheap and friendly service.  A fresh!  You can hear the vegetables being chopped in the background.  When your food arrives, it is piping hot!

Definitely a repeat visit.. if you have a favourite roti that you think I should try, shoot me a message please =)"}
{"text":"Best Roti in the city. Because they don't sell beer, we always get ours to go and eat it at home with a cold one. Never disappointed, always delicious."}
{"text":"If you're looking to develop a wicked gastrointestinal virus from poor quality Indian food, this is the place! If you think, 'well, this food looks a little mediocre or perhaps even sketchy,' you're right! I was PISSING out of my ass for 3 days - I had at least 50 bowel movements over the course of 48 hours. Apparently, they do not abide by basic food storage and health guidelines here ... I hope this place suffers the same fate as my bowel movements and moves swiftly down the shitter. Be warned. Also, if you want quality Indian food that won't make you bedridden for several days, try Banjara!"}
{"text":"Had my first experience eating roti at Mother India and really enjoyed the food and the service.  Lovely people, good food, and reasonably priced. The restaurant is clean, also.  If you haven't tried it, I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did."}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise finding this spot. 

It's most ideal for takeout but you can dine in there as well - no frills. Location can be a parking nightmare. 

Food was very tasty but spicy! As someone who loves spice, I was shocked at how hot medium was...still edible though.  

Simosas were good. Butter chicken roti was really good and the veggie rice dish was great. $28 fed two generously."}
{"text":"Go hungry. The portions are absolutely monster-size! There's nothing fancy about this place, but it produces decent food. Not sure how fresh the samosas are, as they just sit in the display case, but they were ok, nonetheless. I got the mixed veggie roti and it was decent. I don't think I was crazy about the sauce, but I would definitely come back and try something else. The prices are extremely cheap, too."}
{"text":"The Indian food here is delicious, and lots of vegetarian options. The service is extremely polite and quick. The price can't be beat! The portions are large enough for a really hungry person, or to take home for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"We split a mixed vegetable roti and a lamb roti between the two of us, and it was a fantastic meal. We ordered it medium-spicy and that was perfect, I'm not sure how hot their hot is. The waiter provides customers with a jug of water which is fantastic thing to do for this type of lunch. I'll go again the next time I'm in Parkdale. Don't be discouraged by the bleak entranceway, once you start to eat you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem. The food was very tasty and the staff friendly. So inexpensive. A top choice for Indian food. I liked the chicken tikka and my wife the saag kofta. A great week night meal."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The prices are pretty good, especially considering how large the rotis are.  My personal favourite is the mixed vegetable roti in medium spicy.  I usually eat half or three-quarters of it and take the rest home.  The man who works there (possibly the owner) is also lovely and takes great pride in the place."}
{"text":"Wonderful and amazing roti.  picked some up for the ride home to Detroit, wound up tearing it up before we hit the bridge.  everyone there is friendly and aims to please.  great experience, i hate that its four hours away"}
{"text":"I ate here with my family and the food was awesome. Triggered a nostalgic response, felt i was back home in India. Really delicious food overall, portions of the roti are good for two, unless you have a nice appetite.
Saag Paneer Roti - fantastic, 
Lamb Roti - just fabulous ! - best so far amongst all the rotis that i tried.
Butter Chicken Roti - ok, i've had better, but still decent.
Chicken Jalfrezie - U can skip this.
Want to try the Chikken Tikka Masala roti next time.  Servers were pleasant, helpful and service was quick. Place is nothing fancy, but the food makes up for all of that. Bit of a trip in streetcar as it is quite west for me, but i would say it is still worth it."}
{"text":"Jesus fucking Christ!!! Wow! Just wow! This is the greatest fucking food on the planet!! The roti's here are orgasmic comfort food pur√©e. It's like a burrito filled with hearty goo. My faves are the saag paneer and chicken korma roti's. Jesus Christ, I just can't stop eating this shit. It hurts my stomach so much, but it's worth the pain. I feel full, hungry, sick and high all at the same time. And I just burped a huge one in my girlfriend's face like a disgusting animal. And I don't care. She doesn't even care. Because nothing matters anymore. Everything is going to be great. It's better than great. Thank you, Mother India. Namaste."}
{"text":"Ahh the roti, the curries, the spice!  I can't really pimp this place enough, or better than the plethora of solid reviews it already has. This is a sublime Indian experience, the curries are all made with fresh herbs and the rotis are giant. Watch out for anything beyond medium spice.

What are you waiting for?! Go get a friggin roti!"}
{"text":"Straight to the point:
Everything was ordered mild to med heat cuz I heard it can get pretty spicy (and I can usually handle spice)

Saag paneer roti   - amazing!  Must try!
Butter chicken roti - different taste/sauce from the butter chickens im used to eating in NY and jersey city; good but not great. 

Also tried the masala dosa which was just okay."}
{"text":"What's that noise you hear? Oh, that was me grumbling that Gandhi Roti[1], though delicious, is too expensive for a hole-in-the-wall take-out joint that doesn't even have the decency to throw in some free chutney or pickles--or any other freebies with your order to compensate for the long waits and trapping pungent odors reminiscent of a NYC cab in your hair, long after you've paid and gone home to eat your food.

Lucky for nit-picky, pain-in-the-ass diners like me, and the 10 other Yelpers in our group, partner establishment Mother India has the same exact food as Gandhi Roti at the SAME prices BUT also provides: menus, tables, seats, servers, real plates, real cutlery, and carafes of water to fill your metal cup.

FOOD
I went with my favorite: saag paneer roti at medium heat. The saag (spinach puree) is dense and creamy, interlaced with the occasional potato chunk and cube of paneer (homemade cheese) to break up the monotony. All of it is tucked snug into a big sturdy blanket of tasty roti (Indian flatbread). And when they say \"medium,\" they really mean medium, not wimpy Toronto medium.

My saag paneer roti tasted exactly the same as at Gandhi but I think the portion may have been smaller because I was able to finish it this time. (Or maybe my stomach has adjusted to piggy-Toronto portion sizes.)

With one bite of Connie T's mutter paneer, I was hooked on the buttery curry of peas and paneer. So mutter-flippin' good!

The vegetarian roti start at $7.95 and the non-vegetarian roti are around $12.95 (butter chicken, for example). 

Soda, lassi and teas are available but no alcohol.

SERVICE
Brisk and efficient; blessedly free of the \"Yes, right away, ma'am\" and refilling-my-water-glass-after-every-sip business I see at other Indian restaurants. The dishes arrive as the kitchen prepares them so don't expect all 11 roti to hit the table at the same time. But I adhere to the old rule that it's OK to eat when at least three diners have been served, anyway.

VIBE
A no-frills dining room that looks like it could be rented out after-hours for AA meetings.

BOTTOM LINE
Everything I love about Gandhi Roti, minus everything I hate about Gandhi Roti. 5 stars.

{"text":"Ordered the butter chicken, easily the worst butter chicken I ever had. It tasted like it was from a jar from the grocery store. And they include potatoes. I have never seen potatoes included in butter chicken. If they want to include potatoes, they need to lower the price. All restaurants charge $11-14 for an order of butter chicken and they all use 100% chicken. Why are these guys charging the same if they are substituting potatoes for chicken. Never again from this place."}
{"text":"Ive always loved this place and I wont give up yet but guys pleeease return to your original quality.  Saag paneer and chicken roti was runny and too much potato.  Had to wait forever to order because uber took priority.  Nooooooo.   Don't change!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down your best option for Indian roti in the city. Ghandi is good but it cannot compete. My personal favourites are the mutter paneer and the butter chicken. If it's your first time eating Indian then get your butter chicken mild and your mutter paneer medium. 

The rotis are huge and unless you're really starving then you'll have leftovers for later. The raita is a bit watered down but still good to have if you order a spicy roti. 

I have only once been slightly disappointed with the lack of spice and flavour but I have found this occurs in the best of kitchens and so I gave Mother India a pass and have never been disappointed again.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good food, as expected.

I had a vegetarian roti and the mango lassi to drink. The \"medium\" spice level was pretty much in line with other Indian restaurants. There was a lot to eat, and I think all the main plates are of similar size.

Decor was good, nothing fancy, but clean. Waiter was OK, had no trouble making suggestions but wasn't all that friendly. 

All in all, would go again. Good value for your money."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times got the Saag Paneer Roti, and both times it was delicious. 5 stars for that.

My dining partner ordered a chicken rice the first time and one of the dosas the second time. Both times he said my Saag Paneer was way better.

Both times were dinner - plenty of seating. Cheap price. Huge portions. Overall, very happy with my favorite dish."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great flavors, good prices!
Simple dining room with friendly service.
Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! After reading all the great reviews, I wasn't sure if it would live up to to high expectations. I'm pleased to say it did. The butter chicken roti was amazing! So was the saag paneer...it just melts in your mouth. Absolutely delicious. The portions are large though...my husband and I could finish a little over half of our rotis. We also ordered idli which was just about ok. We'll definitely go back for more roti though!"}
{"text":"Nice service, reasonable prices, and better/more interesting flavour than the average TO Indian food restaurant.  Was hesitant to try a roti place because I cannot eat wheat; however, they were more than happy to accommodate.  

Not a place to take a first date, because the decor is a bit boring."}
{"text":"Meh. 

I wandered down to Queen St trying to decide whether I'd return to Bacchus (from whence I recently had the Most Amazing Roti) or try Mother India to compare. As it turns out, Bacchus was closed, so my decision was easy. 

I got two rotis, a chicken and a spinach and potato, both spicy. I was underwhelmed by both. The spinach and potato roti was just sort of... mushy. And, although it was very spicy, somehow still felt sort of bland. The chicken roti was somewhat better, but still not mind blowing. Flavorful, but not enough variation in texture to be particularly interesting. The roti bread part itself seemed sort of bland as well. Especially compared with the incredible bread at Bacchus. 

On the other hand, they win points for being spicy enough for me - I like my food to bite back and am only rarely satisfied with the spice level when I order food. Mother India certainly made me sweat.

The woman working at the counter was friendly, which was nice, and engaged me in conversation about the weather while I was waiting, but all around I found little of particular interest at Mother India. I would enjoy eating one of their rotis if someone brought it home to me, but wouldn't go out of my way to get one."}
{"text":"My favourite roti place in the city! We usually eat in but I've done takeout before too. The service is excellent (and their uniforms - so fancy!), the prices are reasonable considering the portion size. I get one roti, eat half of it there, and take the rest home which lasts me two lunches that week. Their paneer rotis are great, so is the jalfrizi and the butter chicken. Be careful - the medium is almost too spicy for me.

My only caution is the pakora - they taste good but I don't like the texture. They make them ahead of time and then microwave them to serve, so they're not crispy."}
{"text":"It feels weird to review both Gandhi's and Mother India because they're basically the same place, but at least you can find a place to sit here.

Get the butter chicken roti. It's one of the most delicious things in the city of Toronto, if not the world.

Beware their spicy level - it is not typical Toronto standards. \"Hot\" is seriously spicy - only for the most adventurous. If you like normal Toronto-level spicy, go with the medium and it'll be enough.

....I wish I was eating at Mother India right now....stupid Yelp always making me hungry..."}
{"text":"Best Roti in the area, period. When I moved away from parkdale I tried so many places but I ended up committing to the trip back for Rotis every tme I get a craving. Vindaloo is gold, spicy, but liquid gold."}
{"text":"The food here is next level! The Saag Kofta and Saag Paneer roti's are worth having to take a Lactaid if you are lactose intolerant, which I am. Not just those dishes though, everything on the menu will blow your mind.

That being said, there is a new-ish server who is younger than the gentleman who used to always serve me. He is rude and I'm going to flat out say it, he is sexist. Whenever my partner and I go there for dinner he never addresses me, is annoyed if I say anything and will never put the bill in the middle, always in front of my partner. He will also just stand in front of the table with a pad and pen and say, \"Yeah?\" to us when he is ready to take our order.

Anyway, in all honesty, the food is worth the rudeness, which I would normally never say!"}
{"text":"Faboosh! Some of the best food in Toronto -- you will not be disappointed! YUMMMY!"}
{"text":"Hot, steaming and fresh are the words to describe this establishment.  Their rotis are some of the best that I have ever had.  Their rice dishes are pretty good too, particularly the butter chicken.  They don't hold back on the spices either; the most we could handle was medium and mild.  Portions were a little over the time.  I found it amusing that when you request for a container to take the left over home, they provide you with one that fits your leftover perfectly... which makes me believe they are very aware how much you can eat in one sitting.  lol

The only downer was their samosas.  They were pre-fried, and they reheated it by nuking it in the microwave, making the outside crust soggy.  And nobody likes soggy samosas.  Yuk.

The atmosphere was kind of dingy, but clean enough.  The basement washroom was a little suspect, so I never used it.  Service was prompt and attentive though."}
{"text":"Best Indian roti ever! Take away is always pretty quick and hot. I've only ever dined in once but it was a pleasant experience. 

Sometimes your spice level can fluctuate but it's never off-putting."}
{"text":"All I can say is their butter chicken roti is worth risking my life riding my bike down Queen Street to get it, the best so far in the city!!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Decided to eat in the establishment, that may have been the mistake. It seems to be a place that's take-out oriented but seating is available. The food took a long time to emerge after we ordered and we were served cold and soggy samosas. Maybe our experience was an anomaly given all the great reviews. Not sure if I would come back here."}
{"text":"I had the Saag Paneer roti wrap.  It was very flavorful and definitely complemented the cold weather outside.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating.

This place is a very simple restaurant so don't expect first class service and ambience.  Come here expecting only great food at decent prices.  Will come again."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes. So good. So very, very good.

I am a woman of habit so I always get the same thing: mixed veg korma roti. It is truly sensational. My husband gets the butter chicken roti. He loves it. Even when we're trying to eat healthier, it only takes one of us mentioning Mother India to have the two of us salivating and my hubby marching along queen west to pick up the best roti in the city. Oh that fabulous dough. That creamy rich sauce. The tender vegetables!
The restaurant itself is not a thing of beauty, but being a takeout gal, I don't much care. I'd rather they save money on renovations and fancy decor and just keep doing what they're doing."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a roti. Ordered one upon arrival for take out, and it took about 10 minutes to prepare. If you think that's too long, it's not, the roti was delicious and mother India is definitely one of the best places for them in the city."}
{"text":"Solid veg and non-veg rotis, this place is a staple take-out spot. Saag paneer is my go-to; the mutter paneer ranks second.  
I love these guys - consistently amazing!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Mother India but unfortunately I have to agree with some of the other reviewers about their Roti's lack of filling.  I ordered the Curry Chicken Roti by delivery.  At least the other reviewers had some potatoes...mine was mostly sauce.  I had about 4 tiny potatoes and about 4 tiny pieces of chicken... I wish I was kidding.  The roti upon arrival looked flat. This was not a chicken Roti...it was a sauce roti with tiny bits of potatoes and chicken.  The taste of the roti shell, sauce and potatoes was ok but for the price and for practically no filling. I suggest you go elsewhere.  I hope they correct this issue and if they do I will try them again, if not I won't go to their restaurant again."}
{"text":"Great food, made fresh and reasonably priced. Things to order:
     Butter chicken roti - medium spice level
     Malai kofta roti for vegetarians - medium spice
     Chicken biryani is pretty decent
     Spinach roti - medium spice

The decor and ambience is less than desirable but if you are willing to overlook that then you will pleasantly surprised with the efficient service and value for your money. Take-out is not a bad option and 1 roti can be split between 2 people."}
{"text":"Super heavy but just the best. My faves are mutar paneer or saag paneer. Best hangover food."}
{"text":"My go-to for comfort food. I seriously think I've ordered from here like thirty times. 

It's super filling and probably best split between two people, however I find that it tastes great leftover too. Not to say that I have never eaten the whole thing because that has definitely happened.

I started off eating Butter Chicken and thought it was too good to venture away from. However, eventually I decided to try the Saag Paneer curry roti and I'm so glad I did! That is my new go-to. Creamy sauce with spinach and chunks of Paneer. So good.

I haven't eaten in the restaurant ever, always take out / delivery, so I can't attest to that. Also I've gotten the dishes before and I'm not a huge fan. For some reason the Roti is just immensely better."}
{"text":"Mutter paneer roti gets my vote for pretty damn good next to Ghandi's but for heaven's sake please make it spicy when I ask for it. 
I constantly ask for hot and get medium, sometimes getting into the \"are you sure you want spicy?\" Conversation with the waiter. 
Yes I do want spicy, just because I'm white doesn't mean you have to baby my taste buds. 
I keep coming back, so obviously the food is good."}
{"text":"It was as good as the ratings suggest.

I ordered something other than a roti by mistake...the manager said it would be no problem to bring me one...so he switched it! And it was my fault! I had a lamb and veg roti. Fuck. It was great. Eat half though, save the rest for later. You don't need a whole roti."}
{"text":"After walking by this place countless times, I finally decided to pop in and satiate my cravings for Indian food. The place was pretty empty on a Thursday evening, and the lady behind the counter was very friendly and smiled the entire time while I asked and she answered my questions regarding the menu. For example, what is in the mixed veggie roti. ( BTW is cauliflower, potato, and green peas). 

I originally wanted a dosa, but I was told that their fridge had stopped working earlier that day, and so they had to throw out everything they need to make the dosa. Oh well. I settled for a mix veggie roti, and the bf got a chicken roti, both were takeout. We sat down and perused through some magazines that they have for those who are waiting for their take - out, and in less than 10 mins, out came another lady with our orders packed up and ready to go. 

We got home and opened our containers, and WHOA!! These things are huge! We dug in, and this was the verdict: 
-Mix Veggie Roti was ok. I wasn't totally won over by it, I got mine medium hot, and it was spicy but there was also a sweetness to the sauce that I wasn't crazy about. 
- Chicken Roti was yummy! I really liked it, it was delicious, and saucy and my only complaint would be that my bf got his mild ( the big baby) and I wanted more kick to it! Otherwise totally delicious. 

Like I said, these things are huge, so I got halfway through mine before I almost had to undo a button on my pants. If you're a guy however, this is probably just the right amount of food, as my bf ate all his and then finished mine up. 

Most importantly, this place is really affordable, two roti's for a little over $16.00 tax included. :)"}
{"text":"This place has nine reviews.  Six of them are five-star, and there's a reason for that.

The food is DELICIOUS, and the service is great.  I had the chicken vindaloo roti, which I'd recommend t anyone who can handle a bit of heat (the medium was more than spicy enough for me, and did wonders for my sinuses).

A few slight beefs though (maybe 'beefs' isn't the right word; I don't think I saw that on the menu).  Water was served in stainless steel cups, which is fine if you're serving good water.  In this case, I think it might have accentuated the minerals in the tap water.  I'd have gone for a beer instead of water (a nice pale ale is almost a necessity), but ditn't see any on the menu.  Finally, presentation was bland.  almost all of us got rotis, and they just kind of came out, sitting on lplates.  That was it.

All said, the place is great."}
{"text":"It's a very delicious authentic Indian taste .. dining in is ok - they mostly serve take out orders. But dining in is nice. They never have enough pakoras tho. They make only a certain amount during the day and then they sold out. Which is abit disappointing cuz it's delicious too .."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We were looking forward to ordering from Mother India, given the good reviews it has received. We placed our order (for pick-up) over the phone, approximately 40 min before closing (I will come back to this later). We decided on two items: Butter Chicken (a favourite of ours, something we've had at many places over the years), and Shrimp Korma, both mild in spice level, and served with rice. Two major issues: 1) Both dishes were extremely bland in flavour (spice level should not affect this; it never has before). Contrary to every Butter Chicken we have ever had in the past, this one lacked the rich flavour for which it's known and loved. 2) The Shrimp Korma was sorely lacking in shrimp. Our first reaction upon seeing the dish was, \"Were's the shrimp?\". There were a slim few, buried below a sea of sauce (we actually had to dig around to find them). Had this dish been half the price it was, it might have made sense, but for $12.95, this is not what I would expect (I should mention this dish had no other ingredients, meaning it was just shrimp and sauce, nothing else to fill in the gap). Earlier I mentioned the time of our order; this is significant as it felt as though we had been given \"whatever was left before close\" in the shrimp department. Overall, Mother India was bland and disproportioned. Skip it."}
{"text":"I walked into the place and thought it was closed!  I also thought it was a dining hall but it's a restaurant.  They have a limited menu as they only do a few things but there's nothing wrong with that.  

I ordered a chicken tikka masala roti to go and man was I annoyed that I was not given a wheelbarrow to take this thing home in.

The flavour was really good, it has great filling compared to some of the other places I've been for roti.  It wasn't just good filling but good flavour in the filling,  It was damn good, damn large and a decent price.  I'll be back to try the lamb.

I forgot to mention I ordered my roti medium hotness and it had serious kick to it!  This is not a North American hot scale it's the universal proper hot scale so adjust accordingly!"}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken (medium spice) served with white rice - to go.  The butter chicken was very good, but did not have a lot of chicken.  The taste made me feel guilty for the cheap version that I make at home.  For the price they could add more chicken, but I would return.

The \"dosa\" was very popular for people that were dining in and I have to admit it looks delightful... I will try it on my next visit as it is recommended that you dine in to eat it crispy!

If people are saying other restaurants are better than this... I am going to have to try some."}
{"text":"I have eaten here quite a few times and it is good! I always order the butter chicken on plain basmati rice with a side of roti. However I personally find their medium spiciness to be so spicy that you can't really taste anything else. I enjoy their mild spiciness though."}
{"text":"When anyone mentions Queen and Landsdowne, I usually think \"Ah right, that part of town that I drive through really fast.\"

Now, if anyone mentions Queen and Landsdowne,  I will think \"Ah, right, they have crazy-delicious roti there.\"

Yes, I've been to Ghandi's a bunch of times.
And yes, this place is Ghandi's and then some.

I like that they have lots of seating.

I like mango lassi in silver cups.  The lassi is thick enough that your straw can stand straight-up in the center.

We ordered the chapatti as an appetizer.  The spicy sauce on yogurt, soft potato bits with crispy fritter things, what a tasty surprise!

And of course, the butter chicken was spicy and perfect.

We ordered the shrimp roti (which was alright).
The highlight of the evening was definitely the saag paneer.

I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said.

5 stars."}
{"text":"A very nice and friendly whole in the wall. Delicious homemade food. I was very happy with my experience. Don't let the decor deter you."}
{"text":"Best roti! Enough said, just go. They customize everything. Service is amazing, so friendly. Just a family joint. The music is great. I loooooove the mixed veggie korma roti."}
{"text":"We snapped a photo of the microwave behind the front counter.  It may be faulty, however, because the samosa we ordered was still cold in the middle.  Let's just be clear: we paid $1.50 for a samosa at a restaurant that was heated in the microwave...improperly. 

We told the server it was cold, he asked if we wanted another one.  Now wise to the fact that they'd just nuked the samosa, we declined.

Food was good.  Vegetable biryani & Saag Paneer.  Service was minus one hundred points.  This guy really sucked bad.  He brought our mango chutney and pickled lime after we'd finished our meals.  We'd have flagged him down sooner, but he was just hanging out with his chef buds in the kitchen.  We told him we were sharing the two dishes and he didn't bring extra plates, just put the rice in front of me and the roti in front of my girlfriend.  He didn't check in on us once.  

The atmosphere, I'd liken to a Ukranian hall.  And he charged us for the samosa.  

GO TO BANJARA RESTAURANT INSTEAD, GUYS."}
{"text":"Love love love them. mmmmmm.

I enjoy the vegatable pakoras and I always order the malai kofta, medium spice. Perhaps my favorite meal in this city."}
{"text":"How do people eat at this restaurant. The interior is dirty and filthy. The outside of the restaurant looks like it's about to collapse any moment and it hasn't been renovated since 1935. 

Dined here twice and won't be coming back again. The employees are clueless, management is clearly lacking and refuses to invest money on renovations when their only profit is from $6 roti orders. Please improve your food, the customer service and the cleanliness before the   Government inspectors comes in to find all the expired frozen food and mold you got in your restaurant. 

The food was very suspicious and tasted below mediocre. I assume most people rate this place cause of the price. I love Indian roti house and their butter chicken roti is $16 and well worth the money. You get enough chicken in the roti that you can't even finish.

I guess you get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"I recently had the Chicken Korma Roti and Lamb Jalfrizi Roti.  Both were medium spice level.  

Flavour in both was delicious, well spiced.  The roti itself was very soft and not heavy at all, letting the flavour of the fillings shine through.

My one major complaint is that there was VERY LITTLE amounts of meat in both.  This was a disappointment.  Although the flavours were on point, I felt duped by the lack of meat in each roti.  This might be fine for vegans, but was definitely not fine for me - a meat eater."}
{"text":"Butter chicken roti always worth it here.  Good mango lassi.

But kind of pricy...  2 butter chicken roti + 2 mango lassi = $35."}
{"text":"My favourite take-out place in the city. Period.

These roti's are absolutely delicious. I've tried most of the roti's on the menu but my favourite is the \"Mixed Vegetable Korma Roti\". I like it extra hot! 

Half a roti is a more than satisfying meal (which means you have lunch ready to go the next day).

The prices are good, the service is friendly and quick. It doesn't have the nicest looking storefront but the food is amazing. 

Take my word for it and check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is a heartattack waiting to happen. Very light on the vegetables, very heavy on the gee, sauce and carbs in general. The flavour is ok, but \"mother\" is right when it comes to the sauces. They all taste about the same. And there is no spice to speak of. Fair value, but there are far better places for real indian food."}
{"text":"Must have passed by this place a hundred times but never got around to going in till today. It was...\"I feel..Like a big burger...With cheese...\" [see sign advertising Chicken Tiki Masala Roti] \"Oooohhh...I like chicken tiki masala!\" Done and done. It was gooood. I asked them to make it spicy and would not be put off by their warnings. Turned out perfect. I give them four stars for now. Gotta go through the rest of their menu. Recommend if your in Parkdale."}
{"text":"I ate here today and had a fantastic experience! The portions were plenty to share between two hungry people.  In fact I cannot imagine getting through more than half on my own... 

We got the chicken roti, medium spice.  While it was really hot temperature-wise, it was just enough heat spice-wise. The sauce itself was very good and I was happy that it wasn't overpowered by onions! 

For $10 I will definitely go back again..."}
{"text":"There is a restaurant across them, Glory of India, same menu but very generous amount of meat, dont get me wrong, the owner of glory of india is a cheap ass too, but at least he gives what you pay for.

I am extremely disappointed with the greedy tactics of Mother India, if you are Indian you know that the cost of making Indian food is dirt cheap. Yet at 11.95 if you order chicken roti or lamb tikka rotti, they think they can just fill it up with Potatoes and sauce and throw in 2 pieces of tiny cubes of meat and call it a lamb or chicken roti. How is this fair? I kid you not, I only saw 2 pieces of meat. It is unacceptable for the price they charge here. 

Why do this shady thing? Why cant the restaurant be honest and think about customers and give them what they pay for? Unless they are going to correct this, I am not going to waste my money here again. Seriously, do they even know about customer satisfaction, I am not asking you anything for free, but give me the damn thing that I paid for. This is what happens when they hire FOB students and coach them to be a chef, and they think by saving up all these meat being stingy (An Indian mentality, trust me I know) they think they are doing the owner a favor. They are not. This is ridiculous.

EDIT: I just wrote a review for Glory of India, after actually being there in person. Read it before you order it from there as well."}
{"text":"Mother India, yes please!

Catching up with a friend who has recently returned from a number of months in India we thought we would go enjoy a cultural throwback. 

As she is a vegetarian we ordered two vegetarian friendly dishes and I can honestly say that the flavours are so good at Mother India that the food doensn't require meet. We got a delicious roti with chickpeas in it, but the malai kofta that we got was a stand out for me. 

The 501 literally stops out front of the restaurant so it is brilliantly located on my way home from work. The ever important service aspect was also fabulous, from start to finish the staff was friendly and helpful."}

{"text":"Update of the old review-- saag paneer roti was back to its deliciousness tonight!

2012: i am sorry to give Mother India only three stars. i found the place a few years ago on Yelp and fell in love with the saag paneer roti. i think they have a new chef. the dish is still \"okay\" but it has lost the deep, richness that kept me coming back."}
{"text":"My first rumali roti! I started with the potato spinach and then moved down to all the vegetarian curries. Mutter paneer, saag paneer are out of the world. Never had such wonderful curry even in India! 
Great music and calm ambience."}
{"text":"The texture of the food was an issue for me. I ordered takeout (saag paneer and chicken tikka) from Mother India recently. The service was great, the flavor of the food was good, but the texture was a little weird. (Specifically the paneer was cut large for my liking and the herbs were very woody and coarse). I really wish I'd had a better experience :("}
{"text":"Great flavors (it is Avtar Singh from Gandhi's food) but the portion sizes have shrunk dramatically.  Barely any meat in their Roti' anymore (trying to squeeze an extra dollar) and stupid wait times."}

Good Indian food in Parkdale!"}
{"text":"Am I missing something?

A number of friends (including fellow Yelpers) have raved about this place in Parkdale and suggested that I try it since I live in the neighbourhood. I have to say, I wasn't that impressed. 

While the prices are very affordable and the portions are large enough to either share or save for next day's lunch, the service and taste were just 'OK.'

I ordered the saag paneer roti (medium spice) and my dinner companion ordered the curried lamb and rice. Not knowing all the ingredients that go into saag paneer, I thought the little tasteless squares in it were tofu when they were actually small pieces of cheese! 

Our server was attentive but had just about as much personality as a doorstop. 

Are there any honourable mentions?
- You could probably feed a small family of 4 here for $10"}
{"text":"I think I might be the only person who hasn't tried ghandi yet. Mother India was a delight! I got a take-out order of Saag Paneer Roti. It was burning my hand just holding the container. I normally don't shy away from spices but I decided that it probably wouldn't be the greatest idea eating a roti that burns a hole in my stomach when bedtime was just around the corner so I opted for the mild version which still had some kick to it.
It was savoury and the portion was perfect (although I was forcing the last few bites down only because I didn't think it would make a good nuked re-heat).
Next time I visit, I'll spring for the veggie kofta roti!
yum yum!"}
{"text":"I love this place specifically for the Butter Chicken Roti.  It's insanely good, a hearty portion and can vary in spice depending on your mood.  

I love that getting take is quick, efficient and almost transactional.  They aren't wasting your time when you are in a hurry.  

I discovered recently, that should you decide to stay and eat in the restaurant they are the sweetest and most considerate hosts around!  I should try more dishes off the menu but at least have a roti here!!!"}
{"text":"I really really love this place. I went in-person the first time I tried this place (it was a Saturday afternoon and it was completely empty - which I think means they may get a lot of take out and other delivery orders) and the food was amazing! I was initially disappointed to find out that they do not deliver, but found them on Just-eat and I think they're on Uber eats now as well. I always order the butter chicken, saag paneer and the roti and it's satisfying every time. This is my go-to dinner and it's really delicious.  

I love spicy food so if you order spicy, it's great! The thickness of the curries do vary depending on the day, but have never been lacking in terms of flavour. My only wish is that they start doing their own delivery so that they can get the money instead of going through the third party food delivery apps, but hey, I'm just thankful that I can get delivery, period."}
{"text":"Not really a sit down restaurant, but goddamn, this place has the best East Indian style roti in all of Toronto, and the price is just right hovering in an around the $10 mark."}
{"text":"So I'm picking up roti here or at Gandhi Cuisine almost every weekend. 

I thought nothing could steal my love for the dahlpuri roti that my trini neighbour made for me thoughout my childhood, but I didn't know the Indians outside of the Caribbean were bringing together favourites like saag paneer and butter chicken with the magic of roti pastry! 

Both restaurants offer the same mouthwatering choices, gargantuan servings and fresh from the kitchen goodness. Mother India has less business after work, so it's a little more pleasant to visit if you don't like being squeezed together with other hungry strangers. Service is quick at both sites. The dining room at Mother India does not invite you to linger. It reminds me of a church basement (keep thinking someone will yell 'BINGO!').  I think the staff like having the place to themselves,

Mother India has definitely won the queen and Lansdowne roti competition and I don't think Gandhi cuisine has any competition at queen and Bathurst. I definitely recommend checking it out!

A friend tells me Malaysian roti is going to blow me away; can't wait to find out."}
{"text":"Really Really solid Rotis! (Duh)

-I've been here several times and tried the butter chicken and Sag Paneer Rotis as well as the soup and the chai tea. The prices are fair so don't expect the cheapest roti in the city but the portions are huge. Each Roti is easily enough for two meals!  

-I mostly get takeout from Mother India but I've eaten in once or twice. It is decent and the service is fairly attentive. The decor is nothing special thought. 

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Very delicious, fresh, inexpensive and enormous. 

The spicy is actually quite spicy so be aware take care.

Service is friendly but they're hella busy with a delivery operation so the food can take forever. Call ahead if you're in a hurry. 

Yum."}
{"text":"Good curry and the vegetarian options are great.

The meat filled curries tend to be a little bit watery. Biryani isn't as dry as a real biryani is, but still quite good.

One of our go-to areas for food in that area"}
{"text":"Happiness is an evening in with your sister, getting two different vegetarian rotis as take out, splitting both in half, swapping, and tucking in.

I have a soft spot for delicious foods wrapped in other delicious foods (see: burritos, etc.) and rotis are no exception. Total gutbomb, but 100% worth it when you feel like crap and also every other time. Go big or go home -- malai kofta is where it's at."}
{"text":"We went there last year since we had been craving Indian food and we used to live around the corner.

We ordered a Chicken Roti for take-out.
Back home we discovered they had given us a Chicken Rice instead.
We decided to just eat that, but it didn't really knock our socks off cause the entire dish contained 3 tiny pieces of chicken. The rest was just rice. 

Kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"Before my intro to Mother India (with fellow Yelpers), I was an Indian roti virgin. I have had my share of Caribbean roti, but never before had I experienced the smooth, thin, crepe-like Indian roti. My roti was filled with the food of God's...butter chicken. 

I managed to eat most of the roti (and she was a biggie), and plan on a return to have another and perhaps try other goodies. 

The only reason I didn't give Mother India a perfect score is the ambiance (or lack thereof) and, for me, location. If I lived near Mother India, I would be giving it a perfect rating."}
{"text":"The absolute best Indian food in the city. Friendly staff, good service and a Chicken Tikka Masala that will make you weep."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing!! Love this place and will dream of it when back in Belleville. 

CHANA ROTI is a MUST have!!!!!! I have had 2 in the past 4 days and am thinking about having another.

A FEW WEEKS LATER

I DID have that other Roti so that made it 3 in 5 days ooooohhh yeah...that's how I roll..

Since then I have tried to cook a comparable Chana. No luck. It was good but nothing close to Mother India.

YES!!! I have been dreaming about my chana rotis almost every night but try not to think about them during the day as my mouth begins to water badly. Cannot wait to be back in Parkdale so so close to Mother India."}
{"text":"Very good prices. I like how the vegan, vegetarian and non-vegetarian food are on separate pages. Mild is actually spicy, keep that in mind when ordering. Service is quick and friendly. We ordered the pakora which was okay, the samosa, chicken tikka which tastes similar to the chicken tikka from \"Butter Chicken Roti\" restaurant (not as intensely flavoured as other places we've been too) and the aloo gobi. The flavours are definitely catered to the more westernized Indian food style from what I'm used to. Less intensely spiced. On a positive note, this place is definitely not oily like other restaurants I've been too. This is a good option for those trying Indian food for the first time, or someone who wants a very good value for Indian food in the parkdale area."}
{"text":"Definitely a take out type of place. They make my favourite roti in the city - with portion sizes that are enough for two or for a snack later. 

Recommend trying the chicken karahi roti"}

{"text":"AMAZING!

My husband is half Indian and though I am Chinese both my parents were born in India, so its fair to say that we have both have our share of Indian food in our life time. 

We ordered in because we were having a craving and we were not disappointed! We ordered the classic butter chicken (medium-mild) and saag paneer, with an extra order of roti (because of course husband dearest thought there wouldn't be enough). First off, our food arrived FAST. The butter chicken was off the charts! Even better than homemade and so flavour-ful! The saag paneer was pretty good too but was trumped by the butter chicken. I would highly recommend the garlic roti but do not be fooled, YOU WILL BE FULL!

We ordered dessert too because we wanted to try the Ras Malai (a cheesecake like dessert soaked in a sugary milk sauce with hints of cardamon and pistachios) but we were so stuffed we only had a bite. It was also pretty good, not too sweet which was nice.

Overall if you're having a hankering for good Indian food I would give this a try!"}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken curry and rice... SO GOOD! Was a bit pricy for one person I paid $17 for butter chicken curry and rice with bread. But there was plenty left over so technically it could feed two people!"}
{"text":"After having tried Ghandi's Roti, I knew it was a must to try Mother India.

I went with my other half, and we ordered the Masala Dosa, I ordered the Vegetable Korma roti, and he ordered the Butter Chicken roti.

With my Mango Lassi on hand (how could anyone not order this at any Indian restaurant?!), the server kindly told us to eat the dosa first, as it is not good when cold.

Ohhh, my goodness, was I glad we ordered this!  I highly recommend for anyone to order this when you come in here for a visit.  It was just so tasty, and the lentils were perfectly cooked - just a little crunch!

The man friend enjoyed his Butter Chicken Roti - neither of us have had butter chicken for a while, and it was nice and creamy, and the sauce was lovely with the rice.  He gave it a 4/5.

I had the Saag Paneer at Ghandi's Roti, which I would give 4/5, even 5/5 (I remember I was mega hungry that time), but the Vegetable Korma roti was...OK.  3/5.  It wasn't that it wasn't good, but maybe I had not ordered something that satisfied what my stomach really wanted.  But no matter, I had the dosa to devour!

All in all, I thought Mother India's rotis were the same and just as good as Ghandi's Roti, but because it is a sit-down type restaurant, the ambiance was much more pleasurable as compared with Ghandi's Roti.  Take it for what it is - one is a restaurant, the other a take-out joint.

I will come back, specifically for the dosa!"}
{"text":"Flavours are amazing!!! Got the BUTTER CHICKEN ROTI and it was delicious, a bit spicy and full of flavour!!! I heard this place is the sister space to Ghandi, which is my fave!! Definitely worth the order!!!"}
{"text":"Mother India is the sister restaurant of Gandhi's but to attract more attention it should be really be known as Gandhi Plus because a) it's menu is the same as Gandhi's with a few extra's thrown in and b) it's more of a sitdown establishment with the bigger seating area and a less rushed vibe. You can also enjoy your rotis and other indian cuisine favourites served on plates and tableware. All of Gandhi's rotis are featured on the menu here, I tried the butter chicken for comparison and was impressed. It came in the same soft, warm shell as it's sister resto and the filling inside was less salty and more complex in terms of spicing. It's still a huge package, plenty of tender chicken morsels tucked into the rich curry. Mmmmm. The menu also featured some south indian dishes such idli (rice cakes to be savoured with chutneys) and a variety of dosas-a return visit is in order to try them out. Even though it was virtually empty when I went, my order still took 20 minutes-seems like they're not used to the hustle and bustle present at their twin restaurant. So if you're in the west, west end and are craving indian, give Mother India a try. It's also open on weekends which is a another advantage it carries over Gandhi!"}
{"text":"I love their valiant attempt to reclaim rotis as Indian cuisine (as opposed to the number of West Indian places in the area).  The roti was huge and the butter chicken was delicious.  Butter chicken is not necessarily my go-to, but the waiter highly recommended and I obliged.  I am a fan."}
{"text":"Don't tell \"momma\" India but I've had better roti.

It may be because I'm biased that I love my west indian roti better. It may be that the medium heat, which even our server claimed would be pretty hot, did nothing for my spicy tastebuds. It may even be that after I was done eating, I was craving roti.

Meh, it's all of the above.

I did really sense the flavour. The chicken roti was more temperature hot than spicy. It felt like it needed a kick of something. I didn't mind the thinness but it just felt like something was missing. I didn't finish it all and it's not just because I was full. It left me wanting. I think for good roti, I'll stay on the Bloor subway line route.

I almost feel like there's a story behind the metal cups. They intrigue me.

I did love the server though and his account of being robbed. It wasn't really funny but him telling it with a smile on his face made it funny.

5 stars for Yelpers as usual. I love sitting back & listening to the various stories and jokes. This night did not disappoint in that department. Honourable mentions to everyone on my end of the table."}
{"text":"That saag paneer roti....whoa. Now that's a good roti. I somehow challenged all of humanity and was able to finish the entire thing in one sitting. Let me tell you, that is not an easy feat. Their rotis are quite huge but definitely delicious. I'll be back to try the mattar paneer and chana masala rotis. 

Added bonus: the food is quite cheap and the staff are super friendly. The place isn't exactly nice, but hey, at least the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"I got the Lamb Masala and Butter chicken roti and they were both yummy."}
{"text":"Last time I went back, which was awhile ago, I noticed that they took the dosas off their menu. Too bad. They were delicious."}
{"text":"Mother India was a pretty big disappointment for us, since we moved from being proximate to their sister restaurant, Ghandi Cuisine, closer to downtown.

Even though their menus are almost identical, everything is just different, and not in good ways.  It's like one of those stock mirror-universe sci-fi themes where things are almost the same but not quite.

We tried figuring out what exactly was wrong, and here's what we came up with:
 
- Food - the proteins (and especially the chicken), aren't cooked the right way - proteins are nowhere near as tender and moist as they should be - there've been times where they've been downright dry and chewy (criminal!).  Also, they occasionally make the one mistake that we absolutely HATE with Indian food - the sauces/gravies are too thin & watery!  At the end of an Indian meal, the bottom of your plate or takeout box shouldn't be wet
- Wait time - ironically, the fact that they aren't low-and-slowing the meat the way they should be above, the time it takes for you to get your food is LONGER than at Ghandi - how does that happen?  They're nowhere near as busy, either.
- Service - granted, Ghandi isn't the bastion of great service, but at Mother India, it's somehow both ineffective and snooty (why, because it's a sit-down restaurant instead of a hole-in-the-wall?)
- Atmosphere - depressing.  Dark and empty, and badly designed with a long narrow entrance/counter as soon as you get in.  Don't even like waiting inside for takeout.

To be fair, their samosas are still pretty awesome and are the same price ($1.50 per) as Ghandi.  We've gotten into the habit of ordering our rice and roti curries at across-the-street Glory of India, and making a quick pitstop at Mother India for their samosas."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Authentic Indian food and great prices. Really great service and very polite staff. This is a hidden gem on Queen Street. I am coming back! I had the curry chicken Roti-medium heat. Still quite hot and I love hot food. The dishes were served freshly maid and hot. We were a table of 4 and we were all super pleased with our meals."}
{"text":"How I met your Mother(India) was from a group taking me to the entrance.  I walked by this place an hour before but didn't notice it.  They have a Green/Orange banner outside and I'm color-blind with Green(Lettuce, Spinach) and Orange(Orange, Carrots).  

Also I usually tend to associate those colors with something Vegan or Vegetarian, NOT Indian but I was told by a fellow yelper that there is no specific way to determine Vegan except to take the restaurants word.

1 Asian Server, 1 Indian Manager, 1 Asian Cook and 1 Indian Cook was available this night in this ceramic tiled dim lighting Indian painting on walls type of Restaurant.  The doorway to the downstairs washroom is recognizable by a metal clothes hanger on the knob and a key in the door.  Turn the key right, if you wish to open this door.

I was pretty happy with the Butter Chicken Roti($11.95) in terms of flavour and portion.  It was SPICY for my taste and had trouble tasting the Dosa flavour profile afterwards however the texture was a bit interesting as the Dosa had a unique crunchiness while the Mashed Potato interior was a good contrast.  Dosa isn't something I would order over other Indian favourites but definitely nice for Rookie's to try.

How spicy was that Butter Chicken to me?  That Metallic Cup was totally unnecessary as I easily consumed half the Glass Milk Jug of complimentary Tap-water."}
{"text":"I used to date a girl that lived in Parkdale many years ago.  Losing this restaurant was one of the worst things about that breakup.

I probably cannot add much here.  I love the simple menu, huge portions and fair price.  I always remember the roti being super delicious.  And the restaurant was not a bad place to dine in either.  The owner was very pleasant.  

This is a good date place.  You can negotiate your two favourites and then share.  The wait (for the food) is worth it and gives you a chance to chat.  

Highly recommended.  I'd almost come up with a reason to come down from East York just to get a roti here."}
{"text":"Mother India has changed my life. As MTV would say, \"you think you know.. you have no idea\". Mother India is the sister restaurant to Gandhi, both on Queen Street West. Mother India is in the Parkdale area, so it's a little far from the hip vibe of central Queen West - but a stone's throw from the High Park area. 

They make the best pappadom (indian cracker made from lentils or chickpeas) out there. Spicy, crispy and all around delish. You can't walk away without trying their pakora's either, drizzled with a sweet sauce ontop. They are known for their rotis, but I think I'll have to try their rice dishes too. For good hearty indian food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"1st experience at Mother India tonight.  Hate to disagree with so many Yelpers, but I wasn't blown away.

1st, I'd have to say that I'd call it \"East indian food with a West Indies presentation\".   I'm ok with that, but when I think roti, I think West Indies.

I had the Saag Paneer Roti (hot), my wife had the mixed veg roti (medium).

The Saag Paneer roti was ok, the spice was flavourful but not overpowering.  Definitely more East Indian flavour than West Indies.

My wife's mixed veg roti was also good, but not enough to compel a quick return visit.

Both of us prefer Bacchus's roti (specifically the bread) to that of Mother India."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time -- friend and I both had the Butter Chicken Roti. It was fantastic and quite large. We were both impressed with the sauce, the chicken, and the overall service.

The value is okay. $11.95+tax isn't cheap, but it's comparable given the quantity you get. We were quite full. The wait staff was very polite -- they gave us the menus the moment we sat, and they didn't have us waiting too long to receive the food.

(edit: as of 2018, it's now $12.95+tax)

It's been a long time since I've had a good butter chicken roti, and this may be one of the best. People always rave about nearby Island Foods (a different cuisine, I know) but Mother India blows it out of the water. It's not even a contest.

I got it \"mild/medium\" and my friend got \"medium/spicy\" and both were spiced accurately to our preference.

To me what makes or breaks a butter chicken dish is the quality of the sauce -- and their makhani sauce is fantastic. It's rich, creamy, and I was savouring every bite. If it was a few bucks cheaper, I'd be here more often.

Update: I went back and upped it to \"medium\" which was still good, but I'll stick with \"mild/medium\". If you prefer to taste the flavours without being overwhelmed by spice, I think it's a good spice level. Everyone is different though!

Oh, and I've been told this thing has a ton of calories... but with the sauce being as rich and creamy as it is, I guess I'm not surprised. Haha."}
{"text":"Got take out yesterday and went with butter chicken roti and asked for spicy.  I was told that Indian spicy is different than western spicy.  Little did he know I enjoy pure fire.  Anyways I found the spicy level to quite enjoyable and the roti itself had rich, tangy creamy sauce that was excellent.  The chicken wasn't dry and the roti was delicious.  I have a tiny gluten sensitivity and strange enough I didn't have any symptoms.  So that was just a bonus for me.  Also I recommend the mango chutney for this roti. 

I'll definitely be heading back to try the saag paneer."}
{"text":"I ordered the butter chicken for delivery and got a large portion of rice with a very small portion of watered down sauce and chicken.  It was flavourless and cold when it arrived at my house.  Understandable, this might have been the delivery service's fault, but it was all around a bad experience.  I have heard good things about this place, so I will try it again and give it another shot.  I hope they change my mind."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I blame my friend Joanne for my Friday after work addiction. Even with the uber eats and foodora pick ups they are fast and the muttar paneer roti is amazing. Filling and rich and creamy and vegetarian."}
{"text":"I will hand it to Mother India for one thing... Their selection of roti's seems second to none, with around a dozen options between all the meat and vegetarian options. 

They make a mean Butter Chicken Roti which is something I haven't seen at a lot of other roti places. Definitely is a nice change of pace from the typical Curry Chicken Roti. On the curry tip... The curry itself isn't as good as one of my preferred joints down the street so if Im in the chicken curry mood I do go elsewhere, but I'm very impressed by the fact they have a Lamb Roti for around $9 plus tax. I mean really, where else can you spend $10 and get a plate of lamb anywhere? As a lamb fan, this is a big motivator to come to this place. 

On the appetizers front, try the pakoras. For $1.50 you get a big vegetable patty thing which you can either dip in its accompanying sauce or chop it up and mix it into the roti for a true flavour party.

I also enjoy that they actually supply decent take out containers for the rotis. It keeps them nice and together and ensures they are still plenty hot by the time they make it home when getting take out. The pakoras on the other hand they just throw in a bag so its best to have a microwave if you're bringing those things home."}
{"text":"Toronto has many claims to the title \"best roti\".  It seems like every roti shop I walk by has that tagline painted or posted somewhere, which is a shame.  I've had some good roti in this city.  But there's \"good\", and then there's the peerless roti served by Mother India.  All others I've had pale by comparison, and I find myself bypassing all shops claiming \"the best\", knowing -- a priori! -- that they're merely pretenders to the throne.

What makes Mother the best?

1)  Superior, tender dough -- I never need a knife, but it still holds up to the moist filling inside without falling a part.  Magical!

2)  Superior filling with a deep flavour profile.  Most of the roti in this city is very basic in its filling.  Mother's is complex, with layers of tastes to explore.

3)  Superior, generous ingredients.  I've yet to experience bone or big hunks of fat in my roti; their meat fillings are mostly meat, as opposed to mostly potato.  The fresh herbs and spices are plainly evident.

4)  A cheerful willingness to accept the \"no, really, I like it HOT!\" challenge.  And not with an extra three tablespoons of hot sauce, oh no!  Mother's chef dices multiple hot green chilies, seeds and all, then folds them through the filling and takes care to cook so as the heat really permeates the dish.  When \"hot\" is met with fresh, delicious chilies, I'm a happy camper.  They even bring out some nice, cooling yogurt with a sly \"just in case\".  Victory!

So what's my favourite?  The best of the best, so to speak?  Lamb roti, extra hot if you will, with a helpful side of yogurt.  It's more food than one should really consume in a sitting, as so many have observed, and it clocks in under $10 before tax and tip (the latter of which must always be generous -- these guys are \"the best\", after all!).

So thank you, Mother India, thank you for ruining me towards other roti shops.  Thank you for showing me the one, true way to roti heaven!  Thank you thank you thank you!

(A final note:  While some like the butter chicken roti, I find the chicken gets a bit overcooked... and butter chicken is the \"meh\" of the Indian culinary world -- venture out into the unknown and you'll be in good hands!  Mother knows best!)"}

What to get: Chicken Tikka Masala with Roti or Rice
What not to get: India-pendence from the bloody Brits, not without a lot of bloodshed first :(

Ways to improve: Slightly lower prices, slightly shorter wait times

It may take awhile for your wonderful, delicious Roti to be ready, but it's worth the wait. The lovely young woman serving here does so with a smile, and is as gracious and welcoming has her food is magnificent.

Indian food is plentiful in Toronto, but few places blend the spices with fresh doughy roti as wonderfully and magnificently as Mother India. I think it is quite liberal use of the word mother, because I doubt too many Indian mothers can make their food taste this good.

The Tikka Masala dish borrows from British Indian food, invented by immigrants to the UK from India, which itself borrows from the original Subcontinent dishes. The Canadian incarnation of this - complete with the wonderful floury slippery roti skins, and the piping hot blend of spices and chicken inside - is unmissable. If you haven't made your way out to the West end of town for some of the ethnic delights - Indian, Caribbean and many more - along Queen St W, then you have yet to truly experience the breadth and deliciousness of the magnificent food choices in Canada's largest city.

And if it existed in a world where the bloody Brits had never invaded and colonized India in the first place, then it would be \"Another India.\" But we can't undo the heinous actions of our past. Unfortunately, we also seem unable and unwilling to learn from them."}
{"text":"OMG - BEST INDIAN TAKE-OUT OF ALL TIME. A must try. Butter chicken Roti will change your life. This location is a lot faster then its sister location Ghandi which is equally as good (same menu)."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Not awesome, but good.  waitress really friendly. I will come back and next time will try other vegetarian food.  Menu for veg food is long."}
{"text":"Ever since I had a roti here, no other roti has topped it. Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on where you live, I don't happen to be in PArkdale very often, so I haven't had one in a while, but I still think about it. Seriously, it's that good.

As I said, I am not a regular, so I was the fool who sat and waited for 20 minutes while smarter people than I came in for the orders they'd called in earlier. Either way, it is super delicious, and worth the wait. Affordable too! I was shocked at how big the roti was! I had half and saved the rest for later - it was still good reheated.

I had the chicken roti, but I do want to try them all. I'll call ahead next time and just randomly order something. Based on the other ratings, it sounds like they're all good!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their butter chicken rott. Really big portion at a decent price and very tasty.

 Would skip out on the samosas which I wasn't a fan of."}
{"text":"It's Gandhi's, but open on the weekend and more consistent.

Done.

Why are you not there now?"}
{"text":"Mother India, I love you. 

I don't know much about roti, I actually know nothing about it. One thing I do know is that mother India knows how to make it taste really good. 

If you want good roti in parkdale/Queen West. Then hit this spot!"}
{"text":"Went again and things have seriously improved.  I hope that my last visit was just on a bad day and they keep this level up."}
{"text":"\"A mother is one to whom you hurry when you are troubled.\" ~Emily Dickinson 

Ok, so when I'm down and troubled and need some loving care I head straight to Mother India. What this Mother can do with buttered chicken roti, in my opinion, sends her right to the Mommy Hall of Fame. By far and away, Mother India serves up the best buttered chicken roti I've ever had the good fortune to wrap my lips around. 

I took a friend there last week for a quick bite and we indulged in onion bahjias, samosas, rice with curried vegetables and of course my beloved buttered chicken. I just don't know how they make it taste so damn good. It is spiced perfectly and the lightness and fluffiness of the roti is astounding. I have often shied away from roti because it is so heavy and chewy. Not the case at Mother India. They have always used white chicken meat and not once has the chicken ever been dry or had that shredded like consistency. 

Service was pleasant. I would have five starred this spot but the dining room leaves something to be desired and I must be honest here, I don't care for those metal drinking glasses. Other than that, for food quality and price, this is a total win win situation."}
{"text":"HUGE rotis with yummy, perfectly fresh and chewy dough with spicy (we opted for medium-hot) stuffing and very generous portions! i preferred our vegetarian option over the meat since you can't really tell the difference d/t the yummy sauce and the cauliflower and potatoes were cooked perfectly. forrest y ordered the lamb roti and was pleased by the tenderness and generous serving of lamb. they also offer my favorite, dosas (thin crepe-like dishes with a potato stuffing), but unfortunately ran out of the garbanzo bean soup that goes with it.  

service was friendly and helpful, spot was clean with bathrooms available, prices are decent but portions are so big that if you're from out of town like us, it's probably best to share a roti plus an appetizer or lassi so you don't end up sleepy-full!"}
{"text":"I tried the Paneer Makhani Curry (think butter chicken sauce, with cheese instead of chicken) in a roti wrap. 
 
The waitress kindly advised me to try it as it was one of the popular dishes. 

The portions are huge, so you definitely get a bang for your buck. Not to mention the roti was filling, and tasty.

More than anything, I was impressed by the service. The waitress was incredibly attentive, kind and patient! World class. 

Thank you for having me Mother India,

Sophia"}
{"text":"Had the saag paneer roti. HUGE and not too bad tasting...just wish it had more obvious Indian spices. Sort of lacking those quintessential flavors for me. The potatoes inside it were bland so every time I got a bite with one in it, it sort of ruined it for me. 
The server was lovely though and the place was quiet and rather peaceful to sit and eat in. I'll definitely give it a try again and order something else."}
{"text":"This place is fairly far from where I tend to be in the city. It is also a pain in the butt to get to. It's not all that nice inside. The sign looks like it should be an Indian convenience store.

Fan-Effing-Tastic. If you've never had Ghandi's roti, skip it and come here. If you have had Ghandi's you'll definitely love their sister restaurant Mother India. It's all the flavor and roti goodness of Ghandi's but with cutlery, water, seats, tables, and a wider selection.  

Food spicing and quality is equal or better than Ghandi's or maybe the cutlery and seats make it that much better. This place is nevvveerrr busy but that may change and the yelposphere start broadcasting this place. 

The servers here are also super nice and on the ball when it comes to water and other things. It's really hard for me to go back to Ghandi's when I can get the same thing with more comfort. 

Overall, Mother India is Ghandi's on crack and that my friends is a good thing. The price is super cheap for the quality and quantity of food you get. I'm drooling right now just thinking about this place. I'm leaving. Right now. Need roti. So good."}
{"text":"Mother India is the Queen of Takeout Roti. 

The ambiance of the restaurant itself isn't glamourous but is very clean, but if anything it reinforces the hidden quality of the dishes. Just like Schwartz's in Montreal, looks aren't everything. 

The Butter Chicken Roti is a must have. It's worth giving up vegetarianism for. Just pretend it's a chewier potato. I promise you it's worth it. They will cater to your spice tolerances and I find the medium to have the best balance of heat and savoury flavour. The Tikka Masala is definitely worth a try as well. 

My only problem is whenever I order, I can only ever try one new dish, as my Butter Chicken craving cancels all else out. I will do my best to hit the remainder of the list and update."}
{"text":"Not bad. Great flavours. Roti was very \"tender\"/soft. Was a little small for the price. 2 of our rotis came to $24. 

Would return"}
{"text":"Mother India is one of the few restaurants in Toronto to serve roomali rotis which is a plus for them. Roomali rotis are a really thin bread that is made by tossing the dough and cooking it on an inverted wok. They're nice and light for people who don't like tandoori naans that are made in a tandoor. I asked the waiter to suggest what I should get and he said that their butter chicken wrap is the best and thats what I got - a roomali roti stuffed with butter chicken. The wrap is really complicated to eat without making a mess and I'd suggest getting the butter chicken and roomali seperate. I ordered the butter chicken mild which is maybe why it lacked flavour. It was better than a lot of places in Toronto but definitly not worth the high ranking it has on Yelp. What was particularly strange is the fact that the butter chicken had potato cubes in it which is something that really does not belong in butter chicken. I've been eating butter chicken all my life and this is the first place I have ever been to that has gone ahead and done this. I didn't taste anytihng else but the samosas and pakoras in the case didn't look particularly appetizing either. I think the pakoras were prefried and were heated up in the microwave before being served instead of frying them fresh for the guest. The service is good but the place is a dump especially considering the fact that my roti and coke costed me ~$17. I wouldn't mind any of this if the food was worth it but I am afraid it wasn't. There are many places in Toronto that have much better Indian food at around the same price or maybe even cheaper and I'd reccomend Babur, Bombay Bhel or even New Kwality over Mother India."}
{"text":"Neither I nor the others in my party were impressed with this establishment. We wanted to find a good Indian place in Toronto. This place seemed promising, but did not deliver

The food was mediocre, and the service was poor."}
{"text":"Finally! I can talk about how amazing this place is, too!

AH-MAZING! 

As Kat said, \"same owners, same menu\", only a few dollars cheaper!
AND, there's no huge line up. 
They even have seats you can sit at while you wait for your take out.

PLUS, when I was there last night around 7pm, the dining area had one lowly couple in it ...it was quiet and very very clean.

The 2 men (okay, more like one young dude, and an older dude)  who greeted us when we walked in, where very polite, and well dressed with matching white dress shirts (tucked in, which is a rare sight these days!) and black dress pants.  

They quickly and efficiently took my order.
And BAM! 10 minutes later, my order was all ready to go.

Our rotis were even HOT by the time we arrived back home. , And was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo yummy. (i'm sure you get the point with all of those 'o's!)

I'm dying for more. 
Maybe even again tonight --
Make it a ROTI NIGHT, 'cause I said so!"}
{"text":"Maybe not the best Indian food in Toronto, but definitely the best on West Queen West (west of dufferin :). 

Their Rotis are amazing, huge and delicious.  If you don't want to eat all that dough, you can have the meal with rice, very good basamati rice, usually well cooked, though once I had sticky bunches, which usually mean that the rice cooker was left on too long.

The three pages in the menu (I ignore vegetarian options :) are chicken, lamb and seafood (shrimp).  Each style of dish can come with each meat, and is counted as separate dish on the menu.

Some of the styles are Butter (Chicken, Lamb or Shrimp), Madras, Saag, Tika, etc.  I really liked Chicken Saag on rice. 

The ambiance is nothing special, but the food is good and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Not really getting the accolades. The swiftness and nuclear temperature of the food indicates that the microwave gets a workout at this joint. The spice level (we ordered two different levels) were indistinguishable, both from each other and from the dishes. Passable, at best."}
{"text":"Got the lamb roti - which was pretty good and a pretty huge portion for the price.

Really not that interesting, but this is the reason I'm writing this review: ORDER THE ROTI SPICY.

When two of us requested that our rotis be 'spicy', the waiter sized us up and then cautioned us that 'spicy' was 'zOMG REALLY SPICY!11!!!one!1!11!\" or something to that effect.  I balked but trusted the waiter - so we got the medium and the ladies grabbed milds.

While the medium spice roti was pretty good, neither of us tasted any heat at all.  My Caucasian friend and I felt a bit offended - did we look like a couple of pansies?  So, he ultimately chalked it up to 'white guy spice'.  I'm honestly not used to servers thinking that I can't handle spice.  Just look at my avatar, tell me that's a face that doesn't look like he can eat EVERYTHING...  you can't.

And sure, most of the patrons were non-Indian (read: white), but it's a young Parkdale crowd (read: hipsters), who you would expect to be a bit more adventurous and has a  wider breadth of culinary experience.  You don't really have to 'dumb down' food for this crowd... right?

Less than 10 minutes after the 'spicy' conversation, a young lady walks in with two young gentlemen and are seated to the table behind ours.  As they are perusing the menu, the lady is raving about how much she loves this place and are presumably introducing this place to her gentlemen friends.  Then, she grabs their wrists and with a piercing intensity warns them both, \"Oh - and *NEVER* order the spicy - it is really SPICY!11!!!one!1!11!\".

So, in short, if you enjoy Indian food or used to food with flavour, go ahead, ignore the waiter and order your food spicy.  If you're the type of person to pour soy sauce on rice or enjoy chicken fingers, heed the waiter's warning."}
{"text":"i usually have my curry chicken roti from this palce. The food is good, place is neat and I would recommended this palce"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Briyani & was disappointed. I thought I was gonna get big pieces of chicken, chicken breast at least & it was little pieces of chicken which was not much. The dish was not satisfying since lack of meat, mostly rice. I was still hungry after eating it. I got mild & it was still spicy for me. For the price you pay ($10.95) I think there should more chicken & it was small pieces to begin with."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and worth going out of the way for. I will definitely go again when I'm in town, but maybe It would be better as take out. I didn't care much for the dining room atmosphere, maybe it didn't help that we were the only couple in the place for a good portion of the meal. Also there wasn't any music or anything, just the hum of traffic outside. The service was fine. The portions were fairly priced and generous in size."}
{"text":"Hey Mother India, I ordered a butter chicken roti but it looks more like I got one that's mostly potato. Potato and roti and sauce.
And since when has potato gone into butter chicken?
Next time, I'll just get the potato curry roti at half the price.

No I won't...there are more than enough roti places in in the area. Next time, I'm going somewhere else.

P.S. Your raita tastes like plain buttermilk and your samosas & pakoras seem pre-made and frozen too."}
{"text":"I got delivery from this restaurant! One of the best deliveries I have ever had. I ordered the paneer makhani roti and the samosa chaat. 

The samosa chaat was a little soggy by the time it reached me, but that is to be expected. I think I might request for the sauces to be on the side when I order next time. Despite the sogginess, it did not affect the overall taste, which was sweet, spicy, and savoury all rolled into one. Haven't had better samosa chaat in a long time. For those of you who don't know, samosa chaat is basically samosas covered in chana (curried chickpeas), chutneys and yogurt. 

The paneer makhani was rich, tasty, and very filling. I had enough food to last me until the next day. One of the best parts is that delivery is free if you order more than $15. With taxes and tip both items came out to less than $20. Would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  I am from the states and I love Indian food and am a very hard to please South Indian.  The lamd roti was quite delicious and the portions are very generous.  I ordered my dish Indian hot and it was just too my liking.

I ordered take out since the atmosphere at the restaurant is lacking but the food was ready in about 10 minutes.

I will definitely become a regular if I am out in Toronto for an extended period of time for work."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Indian food place in the city. And even better they deliver on Just Eat. We normally order the samosas which are crispy, flavourful and come w a great sauce. The butter chicken with rice (standard I know) which we get medium and it's pretty spicy! And the mild roti korma curry which has tofu, green peas, potatoes and cauliflower. So so so good. And makes for great leftovers! Pro tip: order a few extra garlic naan to soak up the sauce"}
{"text":"Delicious saag paneer roti served here! Creamy, spicy, spinachy goodness with bits of potato and cheese inside. Yummy.

But a word of warning: do not start eating your roti right away as it is still too hot. I made the grave mistake to not wait for my food to cool down and burned the roof of my mouth. It took days to heal. Painful. 

Mother India is a great place to come to when you're craving a roti on Sunday because they're open."}
{"text":"This place was a big disappointment and I was surprised at the good reviews. The samosas and roti came microwaved and were beyond steaming hot. Their hot sauce tastes like A1 and tobasco and the pakora was totally dry. Basically nothing was fresh."}
{"text":"Safe bet for great Indian food . . .Chose this place over Gandhi because I heard I was more likely to find seating.  I liked the the laid back casual atmosphere.  I tried the butter chicken(told less spicy than the Tikka) and the Saag Kofta.  Both were delicious and the thin naans were great too. Due to the simplicity,  the service would probably take longer than your more formal restaurants, but that's a small price to pay for the great food."}
{"text":"To look at the place you would not expect much, but I have been living in Parkdale for 2 years now and Mother India has never disappointed the 10+ visits I have made there. So flavourful and the roti bread is so fresh and moist. The curry is just as good over a bed of rice instead. The only issue is the dine in service is very inconsistent. It can get busy really quick and usually only one person is ever working the front."}
{"text":"#IndianFood #ChickenJalfrizi #Roti #ChickenTikka #SaagPaneer #Curry 
Umm everything was delicious! Medium heat was perfect. I would reorder everything. Friendly servers. Perfect portions. Great price!"}
{"text":"Same ownership and cookery as Gandhi's (just east of Bathurst) but with a seating area and better hours!

So you need not look any further than my review of Gandhi's to know that I love the food.  I can't possibly say enough wonderful things about it without sounding like a crazy person.

If my last meal on earth came from this place, I would die a happy man.

I'm not quite sure if the spice rating system here is the same as Gandhi's, although I have the suspicion that they both somewhat recently started making the spicing levels more westerner-friendly and far less spiteful/vengeful.  (The \"hot\" was pretty brutal when I first found out about them a few years ago... think molten lava pouring out of your face inferno)"}

And when I arrived, there was a long line ahead of me - finally had my order taken after 5 mins, I was informed it would be a 15-min wait for a roti take out. I decided to wait seeing that there must be a reason the line up was long, and it didn't appear it was because of bad service.

Ah - the butter chicken roti - was worth the wait!!!!! Definitely will return many many times in the future :)"}
{"text":"I ordered this from Uber eats, I was a little concerned when I found out my driver was actually getting here on bike but believe it or not he got here in under the time that actually a car would get here, 

now as for their menu favorite thing on there has to be the butter chicken roti the chicken melts in your mouth if you like spicy you can order it extra hot , I play it safe and order it med, really good on their menu is  Jasmine rice, as the roti is overstaffed and you can use the bed of rice to eat your roti on, Extremely delicious and cheap eats"}
{"text":"One of my fav Indian restaurants. They can make almost anything dairy free and I love the carrot amuse bouche at the beginning!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 9:30, just before their 10:00 closing and we were welcomed, not rushed and well taken care of the whole time.
 The food was hot and flavorful.
 We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!  I have only had it delivered so I cannot speak for the actual location. 

That being said, in two orders in the last 4 days... we have had the butter chicken with rice...spice level \"medium\" which the first time was seasoned to perfection...the right amount of heat without being too hot! The second time ordering was a little on the mild side but still delicious!  Recommendation would be \"medium to medium spicy\". I also had the mutter paneer roti which was good, but not the greatest. It was a little too potato heavy..so if I was to reorder I would definitely add extra paneer and \"easy on the potatoes\" The chicken Tikka was also very good. But again...slightly on the mild side...so perhaps order up a spice level (If you like medium order \"medium spicy\" if you like spicy get \"extra spicy\" etc. 

The Show Stopper: SAAG PANEER (dish) Omg!  AMAZING! !! I have never had such amazing saag paneer.  I ordered it mild, expecting bland...but it was spice-ful without the heat...and so creamy and delicious!!! I was sad when it was finished. Will order again and again!!!"}
{"text":"My first roti that was filled with curry, and it was delicious. Usually, when I have roti, it's just the bread and we use it to complement our curry dinner or whatnot. Growing up in an Indian/Caribbean family I can't believe that I've been missing out on curry filled roti.

The only thing that could have made this place better was knowledge of their selection of chutnis. I only realized they had that selection as I was leaving. Thanks Mother India, but no thanks.

And Thanks Kent P. for suggesting the place."}
{"text":"The best rotis. The roti itself is fluffy and tasty and the filling is always aromatic, flavourful and has a decent kick. I enjoy the lamb roti or the every-popular butter chicken. And they're huge! I could eat one in a single sitting, but it's a bad idea. I usually grab some samosas and/or pakoras with my roti and turn it into two meats!

My mouth is watering just thinking of their rotis in writing this review."}
{"text":"For my 100th review I wanted to pick a place that lived up to the honour and represented exactly the type of restaurant I love. Food that's delicious, cheap, and plentiful. Good vegetarian options. A bit of a hole in the wall. The kind of place that you get excited about when you discover and you love telling your friends about. Mother India is exactly this sort of restaurant.

Mother India takes your favourite Indian curries (Saag Paneer, Mutter Paneer, Butter Chicken, to name a few) and wraps them up in a delicious roti. The curries on their own would be awesome but inside the roti they're even better. My favourites are Saag Paneer and Mutter Paneer both of which are about $8 and huge. If you've never been here before ask for your roti medium. I consider myself very spice tolerant and I even find the spicy almost too much.

One of my favourite places in the city for a cheap and delicious feast."}
{"text":"Ive been looking for an Indian place that doesn't charge an arm and a leg for good Indian food and this is the place.  They're pretty quick and the service is great.  Their dishes are on the spicy side but that's what Indian should be.  And it's tasty spicy,  but just uncomfortable spicu"}
{"text":"Mother India is a nice, no frills Indian eatery.

First off, the roti concept served at Mother India is very different from the West Indian concept of roti that people generally have. There are several kinds of East Indian rotis varying in the flavour of dough, chewiness, thickness etc. The roti they serve here is the ultra thin Rumali roti which is popular all over India.So please don't compare the Mother Indian roti to West Indian dalpuri roti. Even though they are from the same species it's a different family, genus etc :)

The food has a homey taste which can be both a good and a bad thing! I wasn't too happy with the chicken biryani which was just meh from a spices/tenderness of chicken pov. The channa masala was fresh, spicy and good and the roti was soft and smooth tasting. The portions are generous. They serve water in steel glasses which is what Indian people do at home! The wait staff is pretty engaging. It's not that great of a place for dine in purposes( spartan ambience for one), but they have a steady stream of regular clientele who order take out. I'll give my dollars to this establishment. 

p.s. It's also ridiculously cheap!"}
{"text":"If you read only the first line of this review and are going to decide whether or not to come based on it...read the second sentence:

This is not a typical/full menu Indian place. They have about 5 meat options (including Butter Chicken, Lamb + Chicken Curries and Chicken Vindaloo). These items are either served with Rice or Roti. Their specialty is the Roti. If you are looking for an Indian buffet, or for a larger variety of dishes, or Naan, then this is not your place to go.

That said: If you are a fan of Roti, and you are looking for a budget meal, this place is the place for you.

The curry chicken ordered very spicy was about a 6 on the spicy scale where Jalapeno is a 3, Habanero an 8.5 and Dave's Ultimate Insanity Sauce a 10. 

That means it started to make me sweat slightly, and I was totally OK with that. I prefer more spicy, but didn't fight too hard for it today.

The food was Excellent however. The Roti is sort of a Roti burrito filled with the meat of your choice...comes out piping hot, and super tasty. This place is pretty inexpensive too and you get a lot of food. if my date and I liked the same dishes we totally could have shared a single order of the Roti.

Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum Yummy Yum!"}
{"text":"It was a very quiet late weeknight when two dinner dates and I came in for a much needed fill of roti recently. The incredibly friendly server was quick and efficient at bringing us our large mango lassis and many water refills while we perused the tasty looking menu. 

All of our roti arrived piping hot and plump. My veggie korma roti was incredibly creamy and delicious. The chicken and lamb roti were both reported to be very good as well. I can't believe it's taken me so long to finally try Mother India! I am definitely a fan now."}
{"text":"For East Indian style Roti, Ghandi's is arguably the best in the city. Mother India is a very close second. This no frills establishment has been around for ages, and the OG of all new places you see popping up today. Big bonus is they actually have dine-in seating, so you can scarf down your grub with real cutlery! 

Favourites are Paneer Kofta, Saag Paneer, and Lamb. Their Briyani is also excellent! 

Similar to Ghandi's, spice level is very deceiving.

Mild=Medium
Medium = Extra Hot
Hot = Ain't no Tabasco
Extra Hot= Human Jet Fuel x2 days
Extra Extra Hot= Irreversible Damage"}
{"text":"Mother, Father, King and Queen of Indian Roti. Used to make it a weekly ritual ... Chicken Tikka Masala, hot. Despite knowing me, my relentless pleas for a Hamilton location, and my repetitive order, my lovely server would always repeat: \"Sir, the spicy is veeeerrrry haawwt.\" If you're a bit sensitive when it comes to spice, or you just want to mitigate the inevitable \"outcome\", order a side of yoghurt and a mango Lassi."}
{"text":"''It's nice little restaurant the food very tasty but many times I feel I need to eat more the portions are very small it's clean and the service is good and my daughter love it there so we go me and her and we have great time"}
{"text":"Mmmm yummy! I came here for a UYE while in town on business and the food was great. I'd only heard roti used stateside to refer to the bread itself, not the bread-wrapped bundle of goodness that comprises roti here in Toronto.

New terminology or not, the butter chicken roti was awesome. I asked for medium spicy, and I'd say it perfectly hit what I'd expect for medium spice level -- good kick, but nothing that left me rushing for a glass of ice water -- which is good, because carafes of room temperature water are all they serve. 

Portions were big but not unreasonably so -- I left satiated but not uncomfortable.

Sadly, Mother India is sorely lacking in ambiance. Lighting is sort of dim, but you don't get the sense it's that way on purpose. There were white streamers with rainbow \"Happy Birthday\" messages printed on them hanging up on the walls when I was there, which was equal parts cute and confusing.

No booze, which is too bad -- I can see a nice cold malty beer being THE perfect accompaniment to the spicy and rich roti.

All in all pretty good though!"}
{"text":"This yummy spot is a block from my elementary school and only a short walk from my home, so I was surprised at the fact it took Yelp to tell me how great the food is here.  Although, you can't really blame me considering the location of this place and it's unassuming appearance. 

The Saag Paneer here is so BOMB!!!! By that I mean it's awesome, but it also means that every bite is an explosion in the mouth, especially when you order it spicy. The spinachy, creamy, spicy goodness is out of this world. The size of the roti is pretty darn good too. It's big enough to last two meals. Eat one half for lunch and the other half later on. Just don't eat it as a late night snack unless you want the spicy burn to wake you up. 

An interesting personal note is the fact that this is probably the only restaurant I've visited multiple times that I never ordered a meat dish. That truly is something coming from a carnivore."}
{"text":"I was hoping for AMAZING, but I didn't get AMAZING. I did get pretty good though. 

We got Butter Chicken on rice ($13) and Saag Chicken (12) on on rice, 2 samosas ($1.5 each), and mango lassi ($4). I have to say that the place is a bit more expensive than I expected and it definitely was not the best indian food I've ever had. It was good, the portions are big, but I wasn't wow'ed.  There wasn't a lot of chicken in the dishes either, mostly sauce, rice, and potatoes. The samosas were the most disappointing, after being nuked in the microwave. 

I was asked how spicy I wanted my food, and I said \"spicy!\" and the server said \"are you sure? because it's really spicy\" so i settled for medium. The medium was a good amount of spiciness that induced a bit of snot running down my nose, but I would have preferred HOT and have tears and snot running down my face. 

Maybe I'll go back and try their rotis"}
{"text":"This place is very small but delicious!
I went here half minded ordered biriyani and goat curry wrapped inside a Roti. The biriyani tasted so authentic just like Indian style very fresh with a hint of spicy. The Roti is extra soft and so delectable when it touches your tastebuds. 
Must visit!"}
{"text":"A Chana roti is the perfect dinner on a brisk fall evening. Medium spicy packs just enough heat, and the perfectly spiced chickpeas and potatoes are wrapped in a delightfully chewy roti blanket.The portions are huge and I always eat half and have half left over for lunch the next day. All for under $10!"}
{"text":"I had my second experience here last night.  This time was just take out but the experience was just as good.  The chicken roti was super yummy, though not as saucy as the last time.  What more is there to say when everyone else has said it already?  Good food, no frills, great price."}
{"text":"Mother India is a perfect restaurant if you are into sharing your food! 

Not just that their Veggie Roti has enough calories and fat for a your whole day worth of daily consumption or more.. but the size!!

I almost fell off my chair when I saw that Dosa they dumped on our table! Who is able to finish this gigantic carb monster in one seating?  Not only just the flour outside, the inside has this huge scoop of potato!! It is hard to say the taste of this Mint/Corriander is excellent because I ate this after I have the taste of butter chicken Roti. The favour of the butter chicken is so strong, it kind of overrider everything I ate after even with glasses of water!

I am glad that we only order 2 things to share between the 4 of us. Too much food in front of me really takes away my pleasure of appreciate the taste of food itself.

I have to say the price here are great!! The table are a little small for 4 people with these big plates! I was really squeezing my tablemate next to me all the way to the end of the table.. I am so sorry.. Maybe I got big from all these eating!

Mother India is a little out of the way for me, I don't mind coming if I am in the area but won't be coming here just to eat!"}
{"text":"I need to talk about an addiction I have. It started out as a casual habit but it risks becoming more frequent. Especially as fall and winter hibernation months approach. I am addicted. To the mutter paneer roti from Mother India. It's rich and creamy and spicy and has a perfectly chewy but kind of melt-in-your-mouth roti wrapped around it. I have to stop myself from eating it all in one sitting. Sometimes I do not succeed. 

I have tried other items from Mother India but they don't cause such a reaction in me. If you're curious, they are: 

+ The samosas. They are good, but pretty standard as far as samosas go. 
+ The pakoras. The ones here are not my favourite style, but maybe that is just a personal preference. I'm more into the smaller crispy ones than the larger, almost pancake sized ones they serve here. 
+ The samosa chaat. My dining (read: sitting on the couch watching Mean Girls in our PJs) companion LOVED the samosa chaat, but I hated it. I chalk this up to our opposing feelings on onions. I can't stand them in excess or raw, where as they love them in all forms and amounts. So what I'm saying is, order this if you basically want to marry an onion."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian places in the city palak paneer and the butter chicken. Great rice"}
{"text":"We always order takeout.
We pretty much always order the same (vegetarian) rotis.  & it never fails to be warm, comforting, & full of flavorful spices.  Customer service is great - once one of our rotis was a bit long on the burner & we were given extra naan.  I probably wouldn't have thought twice had they not gone the extra mile.

Be warned, their spice scale is f'serious - while I usually enjoy 'medium' spice at other spots, 'mild' here is just perfect for me.

It is one of our top takeout destinations."}
{"text":"I always have to stop at Mother India when I'm driving through Toronto.

The food here is by far the best Indian food I've had anywhere. They specialize in rotis, and when they say roti, they mean whichever Indian dish you like, but inside a roti. Kind of like a wrap. I always get the mutter paneer roti, and my non-veg friends get the butter chicken roti, which is also amazing.

Be careful about the level of spiciness. If you normally ask for things spicy, I'd recommend going for medium-level here. They aren't kidding around at Mother India. I've gone with some Indian friends who asked for Indian-level spicy and their mouths got burnt off.

 I almost always get take out, but I've eaten in a few times too. It's definitely nothing fancy inside, but if you're coming for the decor, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"I love this place and go there frequently.  Mother India is one of the few roti spots in town that will still serve you a roti that will make you sweat.  If you order a roti here that is hot, be prepared for the burn, because Mother India don't play.  Add to that a healthy selection of delicious vegan friendly ingredients and you know why this is one of the best spots in town."}
{"text":"This place is great, as others have said.  I thought I would add that they are very flexible in terms of adapting their menu.  For example you can recombine their ingredients to suit your taste or dietary requirements-- I like to substitute channa for potatoes in the saag roti.  Or you can get them just as a curry (no roti shell).  I love their cooking and really appreciate the adaptiveness.  Wish that more restaurants were like this."}
{"text":"Mother India = Gandhi Roti on weekends. 

I don't know why Gandhi doesn't post a sign on their door on Friday nights when they close for the weekend directing traffic to their sister restaurant in Parkdale. I suggested it to our server and he seemed uninterested by the idea. 

Same owners, same menu, except instead of standing in a line ten people deep and muttering under your breath about how long it's taking, you can sit in a quiet, virtually empty restaurant with plenty of seating and ventilation."}
{"text":"If you want to know how much people love Gandhi roti, you need look no further than the hell Kat F. went through to come here when she found out it was the same people running this restaurant, only this one is open on weekends. Any restaurant worth 3 different streetcars - and a cab ride - is well worth checking out*.

The food is just as good as Gandhi's - spicy, tasty, and huge. As Kat noted, it's very strange to eat the roti from an actual plate and not out of foil. The dining room was empty - there might have been one other table of people eating there. 

Normally, my motivation for coming to the Big City is to see friends. Since this became a weekend option, my priorities have shifted somewhat... \"I can get roti! Uh, with friends!\"

* transportation issues due entirely to traffic insanity. On any \"normal\" day it would have been far easier."}
{"text":"Great food, great value. 

So why only 3 stars?

Not a great deal of selection. Although they have vegetarian selections, they don't have any vegetable dishes - everything vegetarian is heavy and sauced and stuffed in rotis. Essentially, this is a great roti takeout shop, pretending to be a real restaurant. Don't get me wrong - the rotis are huge and delicious (Too huge, actually - they'll feed two easily). But that's as good as it gets - the rice dishes are huge, and heavy, and need some side dishes for variety. And there aren't any. 

I read the reviews here and thought I'd found a great indian place on the edge of the neighborhood. Instead, I found a less-than-a-real-indian-restaurant, with great take-out rotis.

I'm happy to know Mother India is here. I'll be grabbing a roti from time-to-time, but I'm never going in past the front counter again."}
{"text":"Pick a curry, order your dish on rice or in a roti and voila! It's all just so. Damn. Delicious.

Yesterday we got my toddler a mild butter chicken and ourselves spicy mutter paneer and lamb vindaloo, all on rice. It was a perfect feast for three, plus leftovers. 

I've had their rotis which are also good, but I'm an on-rice dudette when it comes to curries and these places do curries in a hurry very well."}
{"text":"Mother of all restaurants (in this block anyway)..Mother India is a perfect restaurant if you like to share. Try their Veggie Roti that has enough calories and fat for a your whole week.

I saw the Dosa that  they dumped on our table! Who can  finish this gigantic carb monster in one seating...OK, I know this one girl fro York....  Not only just the flour outside, the inside has this huge scoop of potato!!  The favour of the butter chicken is so strong, ....I am glad that we only order 2 things to share between us. Too much food in front of me really think of all those starving kids in India."}
{"text":"Ok, so I didn't really expect much from this place as all the Indian we've had in Toronto thus far has been a complete let down but WOW! Really surprisingly good. 

We got a butter chicken(just to be safe) and I was really pleased with it. I would have liked some naan but the garlic roti hit the spot. I should mention the roti are enormous. 

Definitely eating here again and I'm excited to try more from the menu!"}
