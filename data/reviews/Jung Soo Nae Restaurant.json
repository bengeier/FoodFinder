{"text":"Definitely a local Korean place that must be checked out. They have a great seafood pancake and crab stew."}
{"text":"There are a lot of Korean restaurants near the Yonge/Finch area, mostly easy to find, but this one is quite hidden. I've been to this place twice and it was quite full so we assumed the food must be good. However, we were disappointed twice.   First time, they were out of their famous crabs, so we tried the pork bone soup hot pot. It was enough for two but I've tried better pork bone soup hot pot. The flavour is not quite right and we were really thirsty after eating it.   Second time, we tried the crab, the recommended one year old kimchi soup, and seafood tofu soup. The crab was quite expansive and it was not worth it. If I remember it right, it was almost $20 for three or four really small crabs. The crabs were raw and seasoned with soy sauce and left in the sauce for around a week. The taste is not good and is clearly overpriced. The seafood soup had almost no seafood. The one year old kimchi sounds good but it is much worse than the regular kimchi, it was very sour and it was chewy, not crunchy at all.   Also, this place is more expensive than many other Korean restaurants I have been to. I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant few times in the past. very authentic Korean restaurant with good food. highly recommended their marinated raw crab, it's best to mix it with rice.   The only thing I wasn't impressed is their service, they weren't happy if you arrive early, and will keep asking if you are done and ready to pay when you are only half way done. Asked you if you like to pay with cash or credit, but recommend you to pay cash, and keep saying \"we recommend client to pay cash\""}
{"text":"The food is good in general. However, I find the waitresses/ servers are not friendly. My friend and I order 3 entrees. We have to ask water for 3 times. And when we asked for refill the side dishes, the waitress replied \"this many? We can only do refill 3 side dishes for you\". However we saw her have no problem refilled more than 3 side dishes for other tables."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight. We ordered the grilled octopus with rice cake and kimchi tofu soup for a dinner of two. The grilled octopus is da bomb. Definitely a 5 star for the dish! Once the dish was cooked, it turned into a spicy octopus stew. The rice cakes and bean sprout  soaked up the soup.  So delish!!! The kimchi tofu soup was ok, definitely not the best kimchi jighae I've had. We went there at around 7:30 and the restaurant was very busy. So we waited around 20 mins to get seated. Btw, this restaurant is also well known for their legit Korean style raw crab."}
{"text":"This place is a total scam!!! Overpriced and horrible service. DO NOT COME HERE! I'm pretty sure the good reviews are fake.  My friends and I came here at around 2pm and was greeted by a cold hearted woman who spoke Chinese to us. Isn't this a Korean restaurant. We responded in Korean but she kept speaking to us in Chinese. She must be really racist and really uncivilized.   I opened the menu and felt the prices were way too high. The same woman who greeted us kept coming back to see if we wanted to order. She came to us a total of 4 times asking us if we want to order. On her third time asking, we said we weren't ready and she sighed and looked really annoyed in a super obvious way. On our fourth time, we were sick and tired of her always coming to us so we ordered anyway. I ordered bossom which is $30. I checked other menus at the Korean restaurants in downtown and their bossoms are $20. $10 mother fuckin more expensive? THIS PLACE SCAMMED US!!! The side dishes were okay, the tea was fine but the prices didn't justify anything, let alone the SHIT service we got. At least offer us some free rice. We only got 1 bowl of rice for the 4 of us! WTF??? This place trying to overcharge and starve us at the same time!   When it came down to paying the bill, I didn't want to tip, but judging from the attitude of our server, I knew she wouldn't let us leave unless we tipped. I ended up tipping less than 10%. She didn't even give me change when I payed for my order. So this place steals peoples' money.   Just before I left, I dumped my leftover tea on the table to show how fuckin angry I am at this place but one of my friend was like \"please don't show aggression, it will only make it worse\" and grabbed a napkin and wiped up the tea I purposely l spilled. I should have took leftover kimchi and made an artwork on the table that resembled a FUCK YOU finger.   This place should just go out of fuckin business."}
{"text":"This is a tiny cozy restaurant just north of Yonge and Finch. We came for the raw crabs,  as this is one of the only places I knew served it.  The crabs were quite salty, I recommend eating it alongside rice. Our other orders were fairly standard Korean food - delicious but nothing out of the ordinary.  Service was alright, but we ended up having to get our own water.  I would come back to try the crabs again, even though they were quite a bit of work to eat!"}
{"text":"If you love raw crabs, you gotta stop by.  I was elbow deep in soy dressed raw crabs within 15 minutes.  I could eat ganjang gejang every day.  Seafood pancake was also very good - just the right amount of crispiness and good seafood ratio.  The cold noodle was ok, but nothing compared to ChoSunOk (if you want specifically naengmyeon).  Delicious wild rice as an accompaniment to the crabs, to sop up the leftover roe and soya sauce.  Though menus have English, i would say that the proprietors speak very little English.  Still, enough to serve their customers.  Parking is limited in the back and can be confusing (only spots 1-9)."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Jung Soo Nae Cuisine: Korean Location: North York Address: 5754 Yonge St Price Range: ~$10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3.5  Service: 3  Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3.5   Extra information:  * 2 locations owned by 2 different owner * Lunch menu avail * Seasonal menu avail  Jung Soo Nae is what you call a 'hole in the wall' restaurant. Not necessarily an amazing spot that's hidden away and you want to keep it a secret from the others, literally it's a hole in the wall restaurant. First of all it's hidden away far from all the other restaurants are gathered in North York. Because of the construction going on with the TTC entrance, you wonder if the place actually exists. Once you find it and walk inside, it's like walking into someone's home....not the most luxurious house you've been.   I wanted to try this place because I heard they have delicious raw crabs. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's called 'Gae-Jang'. It's made with raw crabs (usually smaller and soft-shelled) and marinated with either soy sauce or spicy sauce. It's quite strong in taste and it's meant to be eaten with rice. Anyways, because this dish is specifically Korean- it's hard to find places that does this right. First of all, it's almost impossible to find the proper type of crab that won't break your teeth....  Anyways, enough story about the type of crabs- so I decided to check this place out. This restaurant is family run and serves authentic Korean food, their food is anything but fusion.  Ordered: Gae-Jang (marinated raw crab) 2/5  * Plate of marinated crab for $12.99 * You can order soy sauce based or spicy sauce based * I ordered soy sauce based Gae Jang * Basically you get 2 small crabs all cracked up  * Soy sauce marinade was decent but a little too sweet * What turned me off from this is how the crabs didn't taste very fresh * Although it is marinated, because you are eating this raw- freshness is quite important * My mouth felt a little dry/tough after eating this and it wasn't very pleasant * The claw part wasn't cracked and there was no way I could break it with my teeth * I was quite disappointed with this dish since I was looking forward to it  Ordered: CheolPan JjooGgooMi (baby squid stir fry) 5/5  * Baby squid stir fried with vegetables and ricecake for two people at $19.99 * This was recommended by my friend who's had it before * It's meant for 2 people and cooked at your table  * This is very spicy (be aware!!) * It came with lots of baby squid, ricecakes and vegetables * Sauce was very intense in flavor (spices) and it was good to eat with rice * I thought it was kind of odd how they had broccoli in it * I loved this dish and would go back just for it  Complimentary: Kong Bi Ji  * This is a grinded up bean paste that people like to eat with the rice * I am not a big fan of beans....or grinded up beans so I didn't really enjoy it * But my friend said it was really good!  Mid way through our meal, the restaurant was full house and it got super busy. There was only one person serving all the tables and even though the restaurant isn't that big, I could even tell that he was so overwhelmed. Although the Gae Jang (raw crabs) were kind of disappointing, I really loved the Squid stir fry and would go back just for that dish. Keep in mind that it can get super loud in the restaurant and it's def not a place to go for a date. I would like to go back and try other dishes off from their menu."}
{"text":"Very rude service, we received cut eye from the serving staff because we ordered too little."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for a late lunch/early dinner. The restaurant has about 10 tables or so, and there was traffic of customers going in and out (which was a good sign to me). I came here specifically to try the raw crabs after finding out that they served it. I ordered the raw crabs in the special sauce, and the tofu stew. This was my first time trying raw crabs. I found that both the crabs and the stew was quite salty. The owners and workers here do not know much English, it took 3 people to finally be able to answer my friends question of where the washroom was. Not that them not knowing english was a problem, but it felt like they didn't really want to bother with us at all.  I'm not sure if I would return again..."}
{"text":"Price?7/10 (10 means really expensive)  Service: 9/10 Family-oriented. Really warm and friendly.  Food: 9/10 -raw crab: 10/10.  love it! If you like Korean style food, u must try this. Put the rice in the crab and eat together. -fish with hot sauce: 9/10. Sauce is great  -kimchi fried rice: 7/10   Food amount: 8/10 (10 means a lot)  Environment: 8/10 Feels like you come back home. Not fancy or special but warm."}
{"text":"Must visit if you want authentic traditional delicious Korean food. Food tastes like it was made with love and care by your grandmother's hands. That's all I have to say about this place. Go eat!!!"}
{"text":"This place has korean raw crab \"Ge-Jang\" that is one of my absolute favorites. I always come here for their raw crabs. This place is located at yonge and finch- it's a small little restaurant below an apartment building.  Price for dinner is pretty decent for the amount and quality of the food that you are getting.  I only gave a 4 star due to the service- i find that service is not very consistent with the staff at this restaurant.  Overall, you must try the raw crab if you do come to this restaurant !!! It's so good that i come back once every little while :)"}
{"text":"We received very rude service from multiple servers in the restaurant. Quite unbelievable that there is service like this in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here often as they provide rare dishes. But I wouldn't visit there anymore because of bad service and cheap about side dishes. When I asked few side dishes, they said they don't have it anymore. But it wasn't! They served more side dishes to the next table.. I guess they ordered more?!? But it wasn't nice when they lied like that. Left there feel upset.."}
{"text":"I would almost give it a 5 star. Raw crab: as good I can dream of, this side of Pacific. They use the blue crab, instead of the type from Korea for obvious reason. It is not as big, and a little harder in shell. Otherwise the taste is just as good and sweet.  Seafood pancake: excellent.  The only draw back is packing and sign to the restaurant."}
{"text":"When you step inside, it's like you've been transported to a small restaurant in rural Korea circa 1995. It's unassuming, no frills, old-fashioned, AWESOME country food. (And yes, as another Yelper noted, the washroom is VERY impressively CLEAN.) Especially well-known for the oh-so-delicious, fermented cheong-guk-jang (think stinky miso soup or Japanese natto in soup form) or raw (blue) crab marinated in either soy sauce (recommended) or hot spicy sauce. Probably not the best place for a first date, suitable for Korean family visiting from Korea (because it's that authentic)."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Who would have expected a restaurant right under an apartment? If you're not looking carefully, you'll miss this place. A lot of Korean places give you this mom and pop store feeling but this one goes one step further to make you feel homey (perhaps unintentionally). This restaurant makes me feel like I'm eating at someone's house. Don't worry, you can keep your shoes on. It's a pretty small place. The owners look like they are family. And we were able to see their refrigerator and microwave from where we were sitting.   On a Saturday night they were packed so they must be doing something right.  Food wise, they have the standard Korean stuff with a few uncommon finds. They have sauced crab. They also have red bean porridge/noodles. We ordered kimchi stew and pollack stew. Both were very good, and reasonably priced.   So with a name most non-Koreans can't pronounce, its strange location, this is the perfect definition of a hole in the wall hidden gem. Based on just 2 dishes, I can't say if it's superior to other restaurants. But I'm definitely going to revisit. This is one of the few restaurants that can make me feel like I'm in a different country."}
{"text":"The GanJang GeJang raw crabs arrived in two plates and split open to reveal the guts inside each small blue crab. It looked mighty fresh. Gen was a big fan of the special soy sauce blend and taught us to eat it by taking some of the rice and putting it into the shell of the crab in order to use up the soy sauce blend. The soy sauce was actually really delicious! The best part was mixing the fat of the carb, called tomalley, into the rice with the sauce!  The difference between cooked crabs and raw crabs is that the meat in the raw crab was very gooey, with its texture and consistency similar to that of egg yolk. It was chilled and very gooey. You cannot distinguish any 'meat' inside at all. It also took a bit of time to chew through the shell and legs of the crab in order to eat it. However, it was a very unique and satisfying experience! The rice really went well with the soy sauce blend as well."}
{"text":"After bugging my bf to come here for months so I can try their infamous soy sauce marinated crabs, we finally went yesterday evening! We were quickly seated by who I think was one of the owner and I remember other yelpers mentioned that the owner and servers were quite rude.  I felt a bit of that rudeness when my bf asked the owner how good the crabs were because he's never had them here in Toronto and the owner answered they're the best in Toronto. I don't speak Korean but you can tell by the tone of her voice. It was just an innocent question..geez. I guess she's moody 24/7.  Anyway, our side dishes came fairly quickly as well as our food. The crabs came first, and immediately I saw how small they were. These were blue crabs in soy sauce and there were two cut in half. The best part is mixing the crab with rice, and I made sure to scrape everything off. Delicious! There's not a lot of meat with the other part but you won't taste any fishiness because it's been marinated well. My bf said the soy sauce marinated crabs taste the same if you were to eat it in Korea. We also shared a ground soybean stew, and that was alright.  Overall, I'd say it's good to come try the raw crabs at least once because they are quite pricey! But beware of the owners/servers although we had no problem with the server."}
{"text":"Ganjang Gejang has always been one of my most wanting to try Korean dish for the past year.  Until recently, I finally had the chance to get a taste of it.  Recommended by one of my friends, Jung Soo Nae has one of the best Ganjang Gejang in Toronto.  She said it tastes exactly the same as the one she had in Korea.  Of course, without a doubt, my boyfriend and I went there for our Saturday night dinner.  Jung Soo Nae is a very small family restaurant hidden on the ground floor of an apartment building.  We were there around 6:15pm, and it is already packed.  Luckily, we got the last table available, we sat down and started to order =)  Here are the side dishes.  The best ones are FISH CAKE, bean spouts, and mung bean jelly.  We had them refilled couple of times.  Since it is crab season, all tables have at least one order of Ganjeng Gejang.  We were very excited once the waiter bought the gejang to our table.  Seeing the tomalley and roe just make us salivate even more and we couldn't wait to give it a try =)  The crab itself was pretty good, however the marinating sauce was a bit too ordinary.  It seems like they used nothing else but soy sauce to marinate the crabs.  There was no other taste than saltiness in the sauce.  In addition, the claws were not cracked, so we have no way to get the claw meat.  Their bimbimbap comes with heukmi (black rice), which is a much healthier options to plain white rice.  Heukmi has much more nutritious values such as iron, vitamin E, and antioxidants.  The bimbimbap was loaded with veggies and beef, the portions are bigger than any other Korean restaurant we have been to.  The Gamjatang was served extremely hot, as you can see the steam coming from it in the picture.  The taste was a little bit to salty, it is great if you have it with rice.  However, if we were to eat it alone, the flavours were just too rich.  We also found ourselves drinking a lot of water after having it.  On the whole, Jung Soo Nae is a very nice restaurant for family gatherings or small parties. The Ganjang Gejang was a little disappointing and overpriced, but it is worth the experience.  Even though the staffs do not speak fluent English, they are very friendly and tried their best to serve us.  We look forward to revisit and try something new on their menu."}
{"text":"The crabs with soy sauce was delicious! I have not had it anywhere else so they definitely serve very unique Korean food! Also had the seafood pancake and it was HUGE!!  I'm talking about medium pizza huge. It was very crispy and filled with lots of seafood. The food here was very good and we did not experience any bad service like some other reviews. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"2.5/5  Mostly came here for the raw crab because it's definitely a dish you can't find anywhere else. Overall, the dish was pretty tasty - pretty hard to get the actual meat out since the shells were fairly hard (but that's a given). $15 for two crabs is pretty steep and it definitely didn't live up to my expectations. The marinade was a bit bland in my opinion.   We got the seafood hot pot which was okay. A lot of mini octopus. Not really anything special imo. If you've never had the raw crab before and you're interested in trying, I would recommend it. But I wouldn't go back again for more. That being said though, I wouldn't mind going back to check out the rest of the menu (which seemed pretty big from my memory)."}
{"text":"Went there to try their super famous crabs. When we entered we were barely even acknowledged by the male server and when we ordered the guy made us feel like we were begging him for food or something. Worst. Service. Ever. There were three other tables and each one he served with a smile and it was obvious he wanted nothing to do with our table for some reason? Oh maybe because we were not Korean I'm not sure...The crabs were just ok...$17.99 Quite pricey for two blue crabs if you ask me...The claws were also not cracked and they don't provide you with any tools so it was impossible to eat them. If you absolutely must try their crabs I suggest getting takeout."}
{"text":"First time, all dishes were great, fried pork chop, marinated raw crab, and tofu soup"}
{"text":"Korean food at its best. Atmosphere isn't the best with the place being so small. Literally could hear all the conversations. Loud but fairly worth it. The ahgeoshi is super nice."}
{"text":"Authentic, homestyle, diverse menu with many options.  This little restaurant is kind of shaped like an apartment; because it is. Short on seating but large on quality,we will be coming back here for sure.   Had the moon ah shared hot plate. It was so fresh and flavourful. One of the best we've had in K town thus far.  Homestyle Korean at it's best. Try this dish if you don't go for the blue crab. The menu is far more diverse than most Korean restaurants which sets it apart."}
{"text":"We came here specifically for their raw marinated blue crabs. I've never tried this delicacy before, and it's an acquired taste. I felt it was OK, but then we have one piece leftover and brought it home. I think the taste is growing on me, as eating the leftover was more delicious, in my opinion, than when we ate it fresh.  We also ordered their seafood pancake and it was amazing! Nice size, light and fluffy, good quality seafood ingredients. We plan to order this every time we come here.  Lastly, we shared their kimchi fried rice with an egg on top. This was an A+ dish. We thoroughly enjoyed it. Delicious right to the last bite.  Other reviewers mentioned that service is bad here. We felt their service was acceptable, though their English language skills are very limited. However, these nice Korean workers speak Mandarin so you can speak to them in Mandarin if you wish.  This is not like Sushi AYCE places that have fake Japanese people who are actually Chinese and speak Mandarin. These are legit Koreans speaking Mandarin, if that matters to you.  This restaurant is on the floor level of what appears to be a ghetto apartment building. I don't know where to park here, and the staff didn't know how to articulate and answer to me, so I ended up parking illegally and prayed for the best.  Overall, COME FOR THE FOOD. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with this place. It's a bit of a hole in the wall that is hard to find, but not much of a hidden gem to warrant the trip, unless you're here to try the raw crab or like very homey food. I ordered jaeyeukbokkeum (spicy pork and veg), pretty standard Korean fare, and it wasn't the best version of the dish I've had, but they did well enough with it. Service is a bit subpar, and honestly the prices are not entirely warranted given their quality, especially in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"I've eaten here so many times since its opening, I can't believe I haven't written a review.  I come here for Jip-bob (home cooked style meal) style meals with lots of banchans and yes, their \"dead-body\" soup.  The infamous Korean \"dead-body\" soup a.k.a. Chung-gook-jang, was so named because of the intolerable aroma of the fermented soy bean cake (not the same thing as Ddoen Jang, people) that this soup is made from.  It is definitely an acquired taste and a dish with many haters vs. followers.    Jung Soo Nae is one of the only restaurants in Toronto that actually serve up the \"dead-body\" soup properly without the stench of the wrongly-prepared one.  I'd say Jung Soo Nae is the most authentic Korean food I've come across in Toronto and I hope they stay around for many more Jip-bob meals to come for me.    Only thing I really dislike about this place is the location and parking.  But for their food, I'm willing to brave both every once in a while."}
{"text":"This place is literally right beside my condo. I've only had the pork bone soup from here. It's a little pricier than other Korean restaurants in the area but the quality is good. Soup is perfectly seasoned and sides are delicious. Staff is very friendly but they don't speak much English."}
{"text":"This is an authentic quaint little Korean restaurant tucked away under the apartment complex along Yonge Street. Service was prompt and polite. Tables were for 2, 4 or 6. Washrooms were very clean, if that`s important to you.  What I love about this place was that it serves up dishes most restaurants don`t ie. blue crab stew and raw blue crab.  We ordered the Spicy Crab Stew for 2, which was under $30. Portions were ample and side dishes were all amazing. I`d definitely come back to try their marinated raw blue crab. Mmmm!   Parking: Behind the apartment complex - not many. Alochol: Yes"}
{"text":"*small restaurant under an apartment complex *rude service. Even my Korean friend hated the server here.  *Pricing is ok. In Korea the crabs can even be more expensive.   -YangNyeom GeJang (Raw crabs marinated with hot spicy sauce) - $14.99 Unlike the ganjan gejang, the crabs for YangNyeom are already opened and cut into pieces before being marinated for the sauce to coat and penetrate the crab meat. While the crab was fresh, there was no other flavors such as sweet or salty and the crab was just.. bland and spicy.  -GanJan Gejang (raw crab smarinated in JungSoNae's special, unique soy sauce) - $14.99 I found the brine for the GanJang to be more flavorful while not overpowering nor too salty. The sauce eliminated the raw, fishy taste while enhancing the flavor of the fresh crabs at the same time. Since the crabs were kept whole - which is how it's supposed to be anyways - I would have appreciated more if the staff provided us with a knife or scissors to cut the crab into bite size pieces. This way it would be much easier to suck the crab flesh out of the legs and claws. I also recommend you guys to put a few spoons of rice into the shell to mix with the roe and tomalley - absolutely delicious!   -SaeAl PatJuk (red bean porridge with rice balls) - $9.99 The supposed-to-be porridge was thinner than expected - I remember having a creamier red bean porridge in Korea. The rice balls were too salty yet the soup was just not too sweet. The flavor combination was so strange that none of our friends liked this dish."}
{"text":"I am very surprised at the comments regarding rude service.  I have been coming here for almost 20 years and have never had any incidents with rude staff.  It is a small, family owned and operated restaurant.  I have travelled to Korea since 1999 and this place reminds me of the food I loved in Jeolla Province in S. Korea.  The quality of the food is excellent and prepared meticulously and with care.  At the end of the day, that's what my dollar is buying.  And Ajossi is a hardworking, salt of the earth, decent human being."}
{"text":"The raw crab here is not my type, but the seafood pancake is nice, the fried fish is delish, spicy chicken pot is good but they give less chicken than lim ga nei, side dishes r good Service here is friendly"}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's birthday. I just love this small but warm restaurant.  It's a hidden restaurant near Finch station (under/next to an apartment) and it's small so if you come here during their rush hour, good luck having a seat.   The staffs are friendly. The old man can speak better English and he was very nice. We asked for iced water and he asked if we want cold tea. When he had nothing to do, he started to clean every leaf of the tree they have for decoration. The lady couldn't speak English very well but she was very friendly. After helping us with the grilled octopus, she looked at me and pointed at the it.I think she tried to tell me that: \"The octopus is ready you can eat it now.\"   We order crab soup and grilled octopus. Their serving size is huge!!! Their crab soup was very good and spicy!!! It was also perfect for such a cold day during spring (almost summer). Although crabs were small but they were still very tasty. Grilled octopus came with rice cake, and bean sprouts. It was really flavourful!!  We love the kimchi and fish cake. We kept having those two refilled :p  The price is reasonable for the portion size. I was impressed with their washroom. It's super duper clean! VERY CLEAN!   Even though the restaurant is small, it's warm and very welcoming and friendly. I know it's weird but I felt like I actually was invited to a Korean friend's house to try their food.   I will definitely come back here to try more food. Plus, I will definitely recommend this place to whoever wants good Korean food with friendly service."}
{"text":"I love all their dishes! They have typical korean restaurant menus along with dishes that you cant find in most korean restaurants. Everything I've tried was great with lot of flavours:)"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Food is sub-par, priced a little higher than I would've liked.  Some of the worst service received.  Will not be returning. There are tons of great Korean spots in town."}
{"text":"Very solid and authentic Korean restaurant. It's not only famous for the soya sauce raw blue crabs, other traditional dishes are also very well done.   I would highly recommend the raw crabs and crab hot pot which you won't find them in many places in Toronto.   We also tried the sweet and soya marinated slow cook beef bones; the meat was very tender and basically fell off the bones easily.   The potion is very generous and always good for bringing a few friends to share."}
{"text":"Finally I tried this place after driving by almost everyday for the last two years. I was surprisingly happy with it. It's a small restaurant with about 10 tables and it gets busy during lunch time.   I had octopus casserole cooked on table.  It was big enough for two people. I didn't care about the octopus too much. It was good, but nothing too fantastic about it.  The sauce was really really good. It was spicy, not too spicy, and sweet. With the sauce, I finished all my rice (I usually don't eat rice). This dish is officially my favorite Korean dish now. :)  Service was prompted and the restaurant was clean and cozy.   I can't wait to return. :)  Service"}
{"text":"Small family-owned restaurant tucked away under the apartment complex.  The food was good but compared to the surplus of amazing Korean restaurants in the area it's tough to give it more than 3 stars.  They're very Korean and you could tell they were struggling speaking English with me (i'm sure their English is a heck of a lot better than my Korean though). I got the bulgogi which was very tasty (portion and price were reasonable), my friends got the dol-sot bibimbop (portion was a bit on the small side but looked quite delicious), and naengmyeon (generous portion size and perfect for the hot weather we've been having lately).  Overall an ok restaurant that you should visit if you're in the mood for Korean with a very casual, family atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would have given four stars for the food, but I am deducting a star for the service. They were consistently curt whenever I asked for something, except for the guy. Also, at the end I confused the amount on the bill, but later I apologized more than twice. The lady never responded. I wouldn't bring important guests here if I want to impress them with good service."}
{"text":"My favourite place for traditional home style Korean food. The spicy chicken hotpot was great, pork cutlet was great the marinated raw crab was great. I don't really trust other stuff enough to order them but I think the three I mentioned are must gets here. Crab is a little pricey(4.68/pd at t&t and they only give you 2 small ones for around 16) and could be better but there are just so few places that offer the raw crab dish.   Service is just like any authentic Asian places but they do what they need to do at a decent speed. Since I don't really care about service at these places it's not included in my score."}
{"text":"Wow the worst customer service ever! Got rude stares from two of the waiters for ordering only one dish.... And just kept asking whether I wanted to order more when I said I was okay. Would not recommend at all!"}
