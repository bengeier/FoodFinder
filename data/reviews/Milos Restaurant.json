{"text":"I'm happy to report that I've even been to such a nice restaurant. It was so nice, I'm tempted to swear to emphasize how nice it was. I took pictures of the bathroom, if that tells you anything.  This place was top-notch. We ate an oyster appetizer, served with red vinegar. So fresh, so tasty. Next came deep-sea lobster, three pounds. I have never had lobster that tasted so fresh. And the last thing we ate was killer. Mediterranean sea bass, served with olive oil lemon sauce. Best fish I've ever tasted.   But really I'm writing this review for the service. They were amazing. I think our waiter is called \"Jerry,\" and he knew everything about everything. The waitstaff worked together on all the tables, and they seem really well-coordinated, and very concerned about not allowing us to keep our plates between courses. Once, someone even took our plates and exchanged them for new ones even though we hadn't used those ones for anything yet. Ha. I liked all of that a lot.   Thank you Milos!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful experience at Milos, I don't know where to begin except to say, that the food was outstanding and the service was incomparable. Ask for Theodoro:)  I thought he must be a partner in the restaurant because his enthusiasm, personality, and passion for what he was doing that night were really something to experience. We started off with a personal tour of what was being served fresh that night right in front of the kitchen, where all the fish and seafood were on ice. We were given a brief description of what each fish was, and how it could be prepared. A completely cool start to a wonderful dining/eating experience. We were then presented with house olive oil, with literally, fresh snipped oregano, (the server snipped oregano off of little plants into the dishes at our table) and a basket of grilled bread, which was amazing.  We started off with the grilled sardines which were robust, as they should be and served whole, with fresh lemon.  we also ordered the Milos Special: paper thin zucchini, eggplant and saganaki cheese lightly fried, served with tzatziki.  the presentation was beautiful, and unique, and very resourceful, as the waiter dismantled the pyramid at the table which allowed evryone to grab some crunchy fried vegetable goodness, and tzatziki-see pic.  also, saganaki cheese?  hello.  That's like the cheese of the gods.   We then got the tomato salad which is the classic greek horiatki, served family style.  I should mention, that the menu is designed for everything to be shared, as it invites a communal vibe, as you would feel if you were eating at someone's table at home-it was a nice touch, but you might want to order two of something you like if you have a big party, like we did.  I was the last in line, but that was just the luck of the draw.  I sampled the lamb, which was wonderful, but the restaurant specializes in seafood, so I went with the grilled whole fish, which you can also get salt encrusted and roasted, which looked pretty spectacular.  The fish is some of the freshest I've had and really changed the way I will eat fish from this point on-seriously life changing. it was grilled whole and filleted table side and served with lemon and a drizzle of olive oil. Simple, yes, but a total culinary knockout.  Another spectacular dish was the fresh linguini and Lobster pasta dish.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and coated in a flavourful rih tomato sauce with huge chunks of lobster meat from an entire lobster. Unbelievably good.  Of course, the desserts were off the charts good, baklava, loukoumades, and my favorite, galaktoboureko; vanilla custard in honey drenched filo dough-the espresso was pretty wonderful as well.  Milos specializes in seafood, but they let us know that their sister restaurant Cava is their version of the Greek steakhouse, with specialties from the mainland, and our waiter described it as a place whee they serve thick cuts of beef, and lamb with big fiery red wines-sounds like it's worth another trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"People always ask me which is my favorite restaurant in Montreal and it's always difficult to answer because I have so many but the one that stands on top for service quality and freshness on a consistent basis is the one and only Milos. George Spilliadis and his team from Kosta to Jerry and Ioanna make an evening at Milos a trip to Greece without the need to fly. The fish chosen from a selection not seen in North America is cooked perfectly in my favorite way and that is salt crusted and baked now I know that most of you will disagree and opt for the BBQ method but you must try this at least once in your life just so that you can experience pure bliss in harmony between Man and the Sea. I can go on and tell you how great the crab cakes and Greek salad,octopus and of course their zucchini fries are but I recommend that you visit this restaurant so that you can concur with us mortal souls who feel that those who have not visited have been denied a little of what the Greek Gods meant for the World to experience."}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal at Milos but be prepared to pay the price.  Everything was incredibly fresh and the fish in particular was outstanding.  We also loved the Milos Special appetizer and enjoyed a cocktail and a glass of wine with dinner.  The service was top notch.  But the bill was close to $200 for a party of two, so for us this would qualify as a special occasion."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Food and service. The octopus, Greek salad as shared appetizers oppened our senses for the outstanding salt fish and the lobster linguini, what a feast!! As usual the ambiance, service and quality were correspondant with the brand and price Milos stands for anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went there during the lunch special. It took us half an hour to get seated. The next time I go I'll make sure to make a reservation. Otherwise, I loved the ambiance and the service was good. The white fish I had was very fresh but lacked flavour. However, the baklava ice cream was easily the best I've ever had; everyone needs to try it out!"}
{"text":"Dined at Milo's after a recommendations from a waitress at Vargas restaurant. She overheard us talking about Greece and said we should go there.  Having been to Greece in the past I was looking forward to some great mediterranean flavors.  We started with a nontraditional Greek ceviche. Absolutely delicious and refreshing.  Our second course was the grilled octopus. Flavorful and beyond tender.  It was so good I thought I was back in Mykonos where I  tried it for the first time. Next was the rack of lamb. Simply done and served with roasted herb and lemon potatoes.   You couldn't ask for anything tastier. We finished with baklava ice cream. Again it was really good. Milo's is not inexpensive but it's worth every cent.  The quality of the ingredients and the attention to every detail from the staff was fantastic.  The best restaurant we dined in Montreal."}
{"text":"Feel like your next to a market with fresh treasures from the sea, with wonderful chefs ready to cook for you.   Favorite dish was octopus. milos special and crab cakes are fantastic too.  Great expresso martinis."}
{"text":"I went there for a client dinner.  The ambiance is very european and the services is very good.  For starters we had bread served with their homemade olive oil and fresh basil (that they use scissor to cut the potted plant straight onto your table).  We had crab cakes and alaska crab legs as apetizers. The crab cakes are the best I've ever had in my life.  We had what tasted like deep fried tempura vegetables (zucchini, eggplant and potatoes - all thinly sliced) which came in the shape of a high tower..  For the main we had Trout cooked and coated in sea salt.  It was served with lemon and their special house olive oil. We had side orders of steamed brocoli, asparagus, and homemade fries.  For dessert we had a fruit plate and baklava, as well as greek coffee.  We also had greek wine to compliment the meal."}
{"text":"Much of what makes Cava such an amazing restaurant is applicable to Milos, which is obvious to many since the owner is one and the same. The flagbearing quality that sets this place apart from others is the impeccable service, practically white glove. Waitstaff ooze class - they are literally there to make your dinner experience as top notch as possible, and will focus on the little details like pulling your chair out for you and swapping your utensils without you noticing.   The ambience is really spectacular - it's light, whitewashed, and vaguely resembles a cycladic landscape. The feeling is very comfortable and very unique, especially for a city that's quagmired in snow and darkness for half the year.   The food is very good - simple, honest, predictable dishes that have been honed to a high standard. The fish is simple and fresh. The salads feature tomatoes that don't taste like tofu chunks, quite the feat in Montreal. Everything has this light airy feeling to it, almost like you're sampling all night. Nothing on the menu will break the mold, and if you're looking to get knocked off your feet by some stroke of culinary genius in the kitchen, forget it. Like all smart businesses, they stick to what they do best, which is why the restaurant is so popular.   And, btw, not nearly as expensive as some people think. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Milos Montreal, owned by Costas Spiliadis of Estiatorio Milos in Manhattan, is currently in the charge of renowned Italian chef Franca Mazza, previously at Little Italy's Il Mulino.  A Greek meal cooked by an Italian in Montreal! It seemed out of place but it would have to do.  And the suggestion, purloined by a couple visiting New York from Montreal, was worth every bite.  Spiliadis has taken it upon himself to elevate the status of Greek cuisine, which is commonly associated with gyros lathered in oily tzatziki, salty Greek salads with cheap feta and olives and syrupy baklava that cloys to one's molars.  Many Greek restaurants eschew Greek for the more common appellation of Mediterranean--hardly a sin, but telling.  A quick inspection of the catch, and the total absence of fishy smell, iced on display in front of the open kitchen reassures diners that the prices for this lesser esteemed cuisine is justified.  If not altogether charitable.    If people are uncertain of how Greek food can be, they need to talk to Mr. Spiliadis at one of his restaurants.   Milos serves family style meals: whole groupers that feed five, enormous salads that waiters plate at your tableside, and bountiful sides such as baked beets or greens.  The two of us, unable to fully enjoy such a feast chose the five-course tasting menu and a bottle of highly recommended 2005 Assyrtico (Areti, Ktima Biblia Chora) over an Alsatian Riesling.    Greek wine is not as various as Italian or French, but this bottle worked throughout the meal.  While we waited for our meal to begin, we munched on hearty bread that steeled our appetites and warmed us--the walk from the subway to the restaurant was much further than our map portended.  We noted the success with which the rustic/chic interiors had been designed and the crisp, formal (if not old-fashioned) service of the staff (my fiancé was excluded from almost all decisions and questions).  We sat at wide, spacious tables that were stationed at comfortable intervals or pushed together for large families.  The floors were a matted brown, which offset the formal white, and the fish, imported foodstuffs and ironwork reminded me of the taverna tradition.  The first course arrived.  Grilled octopus atop thinly sliced, raw onions. Portioned into medallions, the octopus was nicely charred but still tender and sprinkled with sea salt and olive oil.  Filling the plate were grilled oyster mushrooms and colorful peppers whose tender flesh resonated with grass and straw flavors that met balsamic and olive oil directly.  The onions provided a crunch that balanced the dish.  Quietly, the plates were taken away and we were presented with a more ambitious course: grilled shrimp on lemongrass skewers with the fixings of a Greek salad.  The shrimp were delicately imbued with the citrus notes of the lemongrass and quite succulent.  The Greek salad was comprised of tomatoes, which were a bit flavorless, a bring feta and olives arranged to fill the remaining space of the plate but offering little else to the shrimp.  This dish was the least impressive of all.  The attempt to reinvigorate the Greek salad came off as unimaginative, forced.   The crab cake that Milos boasts as \"famous\" followed.  Actually, it contained a meaty lump of crab meat spiced with something not unlike Old Bay, and slices of calamari served after prolonged boiling and a quick trip to the grill.  The crab cake was bound almost wholly by meat and was not over-breaded or mealy.  The nod to Old Bay was charming, appropriate and delicious.  Having nearly filled ourselves with crustaceans and mollusks, we patiently waited for our entrees.  I was moving inland, hoping for the arrival of lamb chops and fries.  My fiancé had ordered a dish of grilled salmon and beets.  I am not a fan of salmon, having eaten too much of it when it was the only fish my mother allowed in the house, so leaving the sea was an easy choice--even at a seafood restaurant.  My risk was rewarded.  The chops were rubbed with salt and rosemary, grilled to medium and served with crisp fries sprinkled in sea salt.  The salmon, however, was the superior dish.  As fresh a piece of fish as I had ever seen upon a plate, the flesh was firm, a beautiful hue and cooked with care.  An undisturbed surface yielded to glassy meat in the center.  A side of beets gave the dish weight and the deeper hues emphasized the appealing appearance of the fish.  By the time dessert arrived we were ready to loosen our belts.  Knowing full well that we would be wondering through a city of French pastries, a plate of baklava seemed superfluous.  But our server insisted and I added a cup of Turkish coffee to the bill.  The baklava was as flaky and light as my mother's, but prepared with honey it surpassed her recipe.  It was topped with crushed pistachios and fresh strawberries that were surprisingly tasty."}
{"text":"Simple, elegant and authentic ambiance. In the past, the food has been outstanding. The fish is usually excellent. This time, I found it really overpriced.  I also found the service a bit off.  That being said, it was packed on a Wednesday night. I personally left this time feeling it was just not worth the money."}
{"text":"The greatest seafood restaurant period.  Anywhere. As soon as it opened in New York City it became the number one Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"Honestly, an extremely mediocre restaurant. I had the octopus entree which was chewy, the Mediterranean style halibut was mild on flavour, service was nothing special and the desserts were good. At that price point you would find way better cuisine in Montreal. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Excellent place for fish and seafood  fresh and tasty , besides they make the Greek salad on a special counter just in front of us and it is delicious with the best taste of olive oil , the entrees are divine and the fish and seafood from the best excellent choice , not to forget the best desserts that they have ."}
{"text":"Never go wrong... always great food. Salt crusted sea bass was amazing.  Pasta for my 2 year old boy was so good I hoped he will leave me some..he didn't. . I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Shared a wonderful dinner with a few of my closest friends and loved ones here last week. We were excited to experience this restaurant for the 1st time all together! And it did not disappoint! Great service, gorgeous ambience, fresh and mouthwatering fish dishes. Instantly bringing us all back to that memory of a cozy sea side restaurant in Europe! In the mood for seafood, highly suggested."}
{"text":"Very euro.  The service very good.  The bread served with their homemade olive oil and fresh basil ...Try the crab cakes and alaska crab legs as apetizers. Makes you want to live there. We had what tasted like deep fried tempura vegetables (zucchini, eggplant ...love the eggplant). I also tried the Trout cooked and coated in sea salt.  For dessert : baklava, as well as greek coffee."}
{"text":"So torn on this review...because A.) my husband and I really, really wanted to like it, B.) he's full on Greek and really, really wanted to like it, and C.) because almost every reviewer loves it!  However...we were a little disappointed in, of all things, the food itself.  Let me explain.   The restaurant itself is beautiful.  Clean and Greek without being tacky and blue and white stripes w/gold gilded statues.  The servers really are knowledgeable and professional to a T.  The late night menu, which is only $29 is a STEAL.  After 10pm, you'll get a started, main and dessert.  (During normal dinner hours, appetizers can be as much as $29 apiece!  Or at least that's what I saw for the eggplant app.)   The food is beyond fresh-- that can't be disputed.  What can, is the seasoning.  The fish was clean and perfectly prepared...but lacked even the most basic SALT.  The filet was perfectly cooked, but again, it seemed not to be aged properly, or was missing flavor.  A steamed broccoli/cauliflower accompaniment isn't good contrast to food so bland.   The appetizers were better-- the spreads, all delicious, the tomato salad surprisingly flavorful.  What went wrong, I don't know.  Would I try it again?  Well...maybe the late night menu or lunch...but if I paid any more for what we got, I'd be angry!"}
{"text":"Sono stata a cena da Milos poche sere fa con mio marito ed una coppia di amici e devo dire, dopo tutte le recensioni lette e quelle ascoltate dai miei amici, forse sono arrivata a cena carica di aspettative.  Purtroppo però ne sono uscita delusa. Essendo stata in Grecia svariate volte mi sento di poter smentire tutte quelle persone che hanno scritto che questo è un vero ristorante greco. Per me l'unica cosa greca che hanno è lo yogurt come dessert, per di più non buonissimo. Comunque questo non toglie il fatto che il pesce sia fresco e ben servito. Peccato però che quella sera molte cose proposte nel menù non erano disponibili.  Abbiamo quindi fatto un assaggio di antipasti (molto buoni) tra cui una porzione di ostriche, e poi diretti al secondo. Io mi sono affidata al consiglio del cameriere che sembrava molto competente. Purtroppo però mi sono trovata davanti un filetto di pesce bianco cotto al vapore con delle verdure. La carne del pesce era troppo cotta, asciutta direi. Insomma... Molto deludente.  I dolci un disastro ma questo è sicuramente soggettivo. Arriviamo alla nota dolente: IL CONTO!  Per quello che abbiamo mangiato e per il vino bevuto un vero furto. Con quello che abbiamo pagato avrei mangiato branzino al sale per 6 mesi a casa!!!! Non penso che tornerò in questo ristorante. Sinceramente ho avuto la fortuna di mangiare pesce cucinato in maniera eccellente a prezzi decisamente più accettabili.  Ps. Attenzione alle ostriche, conosco ben due persone che hanno avuto fastidiosi \"problemini\" il giorno dopo...."}
{"text":"I would have given Milos 5 stars if the service was on par with the food but it is not.  Everything we ordered was delicious and perfectly prepared.  My husband wanted to order the pasta and lobster as his main meal but the waiter told him the restaurant did not have lobster and that it was not preparing pasta that evening. While we were eating, I saw a couple across the aisle eating pasta with lobster.  We asked our waiter why they were eating pasta, and he said they called ahead and requested the dish.  We felt put off by that kind of treatment and would hesitate to return to the restaurant as it seems that they do not treat customers equally."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Food, atmosphere and service was top notch. The pink snapper sashimi from Portugal was to die for. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Three words: simple, fresh, quality.  First time to Montreal, and a foodie friend took me here.  Tremendous fresh fish, giant lobster. Fish of the day displayed on ice at the front of the restaurant, between the dining room and the kitchen.  Two kinds of fish I'd never tried before (and since they grill the entire fish, one was enough for the two of us to share) so I tried a fago -- Greek Snapper.  Really firm flesh, flavorful, and perfectly grilled.  Tomato and feta salad fresh, side of broccolini fresh, olive oil and house-made bread, fresh... you get the picture.  Service was attentive and swift, without being remotely clingy or overbearing. Wine selection is 100% greek, so I needed some recommendations from the waiter, but he was great in steering us through the by-the-glass selections for our starter and entree courses.  For desert, my friend had house-made baklava, and I had fresh greek yogurt drizzled with thyme honey.  We complemented this with fresh-leaved mint tea and a greek coffee.  Again, simple, fresh, quality."}
{"text":"Wow, loved loved loved this place. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and very classy, and service is amazing. They're very courteous and helpful.  For lunch, there's a 3 course option for $25.15, which is so worth it. They also provide complimentary bread with olive oil from Greece, which I enjoyed very much.  To start, I had the salmon tartare, which was very good and fresh. My companions had the lentil soup, tomato salad, and smoked salmon as appetizers, and they all loved their starters. We also split half a dozen of oysters, which were excellent.  I had the white whole fish of the day as the main, which was Mediterannean porgie. It was simple but amazing and very fresh, and I love how they don't skimp on the portion size. For dessert, I had the baklava ice cream, which was super good.   Also, random side note, their bathrooms are super nice! Super big and spacious and classy.  Long story short, this place is amazing in every aspect - service, decor, food. Even if you're short on cash, go for the lunch menu! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Way way overpriced. Yes, the fish is fresh and the atmosphere is classy but it's not worth the hefty tab. My boyfriend and I went for dinner and ended up spending more than $250. We had the fish in sea salt to share, two glasses of wine each, an appetizer and some veggies (both to share). This is the most we ever spent in a restaurant in Montreal and the food was nowhere as remarkable as some other places. Perhaps coming here for lunch is a better idea. Also, this placed seemed targeted for older patrons so it's not hip and trendy, but more classy."}
{"text":"What could have a great dinner (albeit expensive) ended up being a very poor experience due to the awful service we received. Our waiter was hostile, rude and careless. Thank goodness we didn't need to tolerate this behavior on a consistent basis as he was fairly non-existent. After waiting patiently for nearly 30 minutes for him to come by to take our order, I literally needed to stop him in his tracks simply to ask a question as he never bothered to stop by. Our orders did not come out as requested, this as a result of our waiter simply not putting the order in properly. He never came by to ask about water or more wine. We had to ask a busboy close by. At 2+ hours, we could not wait to leave. A waste of an evening and a waste of money. Never again. Milos here in NYC on the other hand is fantastic. Pass on the Montreal location."}
{"text":"Very nice place, nice food and reasonable price. I love the lunch set menu, and the whole white fish was just excellent! I would definitely come back again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Yep, if you've got the cash to drop here... Just drop the cash.   Incredible meal, though as the night got busy our server had a little less time for personalised service. Still worth every penny."}
{"text":"The beginning of the end. We've been fans of this restaurant for decades, however, things appear to be changing.  We look forward to the Milo's salad and the Greek toasted bread before the feast. Last week we noticed the previously amazing Milos salad was not flavourful and the bread was a sliced tasteless untoasted French bread to go  with the olive oil.   When we inquired, we were told that Milos is modifying their recipes to create uniformity if it's new foreign chain restaurants.   The Montreal Milo's is the original and by far there was always a noticeable difference in the quality of some of the dishes compared to Vegas and New York.    We hope that Milos can be persuaded to revert to their original lighter and tasty bread, which works perfectly with olive oil and decides to add their amazing wine vinegar back to the salad. The vegetables are lacking flavour due to the reduction of artistic blending of what has always been amazing.  In summary, if it's not broken don't try to fix it."}
{"text":"I love Milos! Whether it's in Miami, New York City and here in Montreal. The food is just unbelievable. I always get the salted fish whenever I go here and you will never regret it! For those of you who do not eat fish, you are missing a lot in this life and I believe if you try this one you will change your mind and will begin eating fish.   The fried zucchini is a must! I know I said fried and not all of us eat fried. This one is different, the crispness and the subtle sweet taste will cover the sin.  Romanesco is one of my favorite vegetable, it's like you're eating cauliflower and broccoli in one! The way they prepared this dish seem so simple and fresh with a touch of garlic, salt and pepper and yet so delicious.   Key lime pie is also my favorite dessert and here they make a super smooth and creamy one and perfect crust as well.   Overall, not even a tiny morsel left on the plate!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. I like to go for lunch or after 10PM when the menu is around 25$ for a 3-course meal. It is amazing value, the meal is sensational and the service is always flawless.   I recommend ordering the dips as appetizer (or not included but worth the extra: the fried zucchini) + whatever white whole fish they have on the menu + baklava or Greek yogurt for desert. The staff makes you feel like royalty and doesn't even budge if you arrived as a casual civilian ;) it's very appreciated. Thanks Milos!"}
{"text":"Impecable, consistent, and always the place to be for a nice, chic evening out. I usually do the lunch special with Tuna or the Fish filet. Always spot on. For dinner, I always start with with the fried zucchini tower. Yummmm! Yes it's pricey. But it's a treat for your date or special friends. Always a nice evening."}
{"text":"Dans le la gamme de restaurants chic locaux, on ne peut pas trouver mieux. Je crois que mon conjoint était ravi de passer un moment dans restaurant de choix. La salle de restaurant, la poissonnerie intérieure, la gentillesse du personnel sont de multiples facteurs qui m'ont permis d'apprécier les côtelettes d'agneau, le poisson du jour, des huîtres choisies par mon conjoint et une entrée de tomate maison. Si j'en crois mon conjoint, la sélection du vin était littéralement exquise. Le cadre est très familial et relativement sénior donc je qualifierais l'ambiance de très classique voire traditionnelle."}
{"text":"This was a complete surprise for lunch.  The food was so fresh and yummy.  They even grow their own tomatoes, so you can have awesome \"real\" tomatoes in the dead of winter!  The fish was simple, clean, and not over the top with sauces.  Just fish!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is mediocre at best (missing a glass at our table and took 15 mins before the server realizes). Service was slow. We went for the late night menu. The restaurant lacks the attention to details that fine restaurants of its class generally should have."}
{"text":"My friend and I drove back from Toronto last Thursday, when we arrived at around 10:30 we decided to go to Milos for late night menu. The service was awesome and the food was awesome even though it was late night menu. I was not a fan for Greek food in that I didn't like Greek salad and I preferred butter to olive oil on bread, but the olive oil in Milos was amazing. The other food there was amazing too. I ordered lobster pasta for the main and I loved it. The sorbet I had for dessert was very dense in flavor. Definitely would go again."}
{"text":"this is the best restaurant experience i've ever had in my entire life. first of all i was totally underdressed when i decided last minute to come and they were so gracious. secondly..... i can't even go into detail because its like there are no words. freshest... cleanest... its ruined me. i can't order octopus or calamari anywhere anymore without tooting my nose up in the air cause i've had way better. the waiter & back waiter were perfect too. i miss it."}
{"text":"Maybe an off night for Milos...I always love it here, tonight...not so good! My date felt very uncomfortable, rightfully so...why all the staring...get a grip people...anyway, back to food...  Entrees: calamari + Milos special 6.3/10 (calamari saved the day)  Main: Halibut + salmon 6.5/10 what happened to the taste...  Dessert: loukoumades 7/10 pls next time use grade A honey.  Cocktails + Wine : as expected  Milos u can do better."}
{"text":"Well I really wanted to love Milos but here is my experience: 1- Salad- fresh tomato salad with really good tomatoes 2- Appetizer- Zucchini Tower which you will see everyone raves about on every review and it deserves the high praise, delicious! 3- Lobster- 3&1/4 lobster at $48 per pound (for 2 people) Tail was a little on the tough side which was disappointing, but rest of lobster good, not the best Ive ever had by a long shot. 4-Servce- here is where it falls apart.  We ordered sparkling water & 2 lichee martinis. We had to ask for these again mid way through our salad & appetizers.  The waiter says, someone was supposed to bring them to you. Really? So we finish drinks, salad & appetizers and the we sit there, waiting, waiting, waiting & waiting for ONE HOUR for our lobster.  What are we supposed to do with no food or drink in front of us in a restaurant for an hour?  After a good forty five minutes, I catch the waiters eye and he says, Its taking too long, right?  DUH YEAH.  So he goes and checks and says it will be right out.  Another fifteen minutes till the crustacean appears.  We should have left the restaurant but we didn't.  Then the lobster wasn't even that great. We order dessert and one coffee.   Not even a mention of \"The dessert and coffee is on us. Sorry about the long wait.\" NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM ANYONE! Our bill comes  and it is $283 before the tip.  My husband, who is a gentleman tips this guy 20% and we leave!  We were on vacation and we were very relaxed and in a great frame of mind.  Otherwise,I would have never kept silent about the service that evening  We just didn't want to get into a hassle and ruin our mood. But really, this was really absurd for a restaurant of this calibre.  I will be curious if anyone responds to us here on Yelp from the restaurant,"}
{"text":"There's a reason this is ranked among the best restaurants in Montreal. Every ingredient they use- down to the olive oil (which they produce themselves) is as fresh and high quality as it gets. I've only ever had great meals here (lunch, dinner, and late night) and it's one of the few restaurants worth going to again and again- *especially* for the baklava ice cream!   Be sure to check out their lunch and late-night menus!"}
{"text":"Been going here for 40 years with Pops!  One of Montreal's finest!!  Absolutely delectable and with great service.  Costa, the waiter has been there for 20 years and totally service oriented.   And why spend ridiculous Vegas and NYC prices for what you can get in Montreal.  It's like why pay retail I tell the Saudi's when you can get the stuff wholesale....wink....wink...from my sources, right?  Ad if you can't get a table, let me know.  As you know, if you know the right people, everythign can be arranged!!"}
{"text":"Superb service! We were attended by a great host. He was awesome! The atmosphere is really bougie. With recommendations from the Canadian in our party, we had their Greek salad whose tomatoes are supposedly the best she ever had (literally what she said). It was alright. I loved the cheese and banana peppers. I wanted the octopus and guess what, it ended up being the hit of the night cause we ordered a second at the end of the meal! We had the special zucchini and eggplant which I thought was the quintessential Greek dish. It was mesmerizing to watch as we cracked it with the spoon. I roll with a foodie bunch. Filet mignon was sooo good. Potatoes were so lemony (I like but not the others) but broccoli was just ok. Lobster pasta-lobster was good but spaghetti wasn't as sensational. I would def wana check out their branch in NY! That octopus~"}
{"text":"This place is overhyped. The service was bad. They clearly serve the regulars way better than us. I came here twice; the first time was for lunch and the food was good, but not extraordinary.  The second time was for dinner and I ordered the shrimp. The dish was 40$ and all they did was grill the shrimp and give me a lot of salad. I would have expected for that price they would do something to the shrimp, but they just grilled it. I understand that the seafood is known to be fresh, but they seem to use that as an excuse to not bother putting much effort in making the dish.  That dish was by far the biggest disappointment because they didn't even bother trying. There are much better restaurants in Montreal with better service and better food that are in the same price range."}
{"text":"Best Greek restaurant in town!! We've been to the one in Miami, Vegas and they are all amazing! The food is 5 star quality, so as the service, ambiance. Love their extended wine list, the price range are pretty good and there is always something for everyone.   The milos special is divine, they also have the best crab cake & baklava in town. The lobster pasta, lamb chops and fish are absolutely amazing!   It's obviously not cheap but worth every penny! Try it and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best restos in Montreal. I've been many times and never once have I been disappointed. If you ever happen to go for the lunch special, try the ahi tuna burger - it was easily better than a regular hamburger."}
{"text":"loved this restaurant. ambiance was so perfect. food amazing must gets: milos appetizer special, greek salad, fish cooked in salt, homemade baklava ice cream. had david as a server, who made the experience so perfect."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service,perhaps a little uptight and stuffy, but I guess that would only bother you if you wanted it to. very pricy but the food is excellent, Had a whole fish and a tomato salad. both amongst the best dishes I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious, but the prices are just outrageous. The tomato salad is excellent as is the octopus. Those are really the best items on the menu. We also chose a fish which was great- just not worth the price. The service is good."}
{"text":"Service was poor and exclusive. Focused on regulars, not first-time diners. It was clear we were treated differently from the diners they knew (who were sitting near/around us). Milos service appeared to be high end, but in reality it was not up to par.   Food was delicious, but service is what will bring you back to a restaurant.   7:30pm reservation and we waited 20 minutes to be seated..."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best baklava I've ever had. But that's not what they are known for.  Their fish has been touted the best in the city! It was fresh, and portion size was really good.  From the outside, it looks pretentious, but when walking in, it's like you're transported to Greece.   The service was very good, and even though we showed up late, he did get our meal to show up some what around the same time as everyone else.   We got the catch of the day, roasted Sea Bass that comes with a large bowl of rapini. It's simple dishes, but very tasty.   For a special occasion, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! I recall vividly the first time I dined here, everything I ate, everything I drank ... I'd venture to guess that in 5yrs you'd remember your meal and your experience here too.  This is what Milos is known for really . The facade is quite subdued, you could pass it easily and not realize it. Inside the atmosphere is more semi-formal than casual and modern but its also very comfortable. The rooms are spacious and typically filled with people and conversation. I really like the flow of the restaurant and the waitstaff is excellent, professional, friendly and helpful ... never an empty glass of wine or water.     I don't think you can go wrong ordering anything on the menu but I highly recommend the crab cake, its still the best I've ever had. I love the grilled sardines as well. I also recommend getting a whole fish, which you can select from the case and have prepared baked in sea salt and presented at your table and savor that moment when a group of men present you with a large platter of excellence. All of the food here is top notch really, if I could afford it I'd dine here much more often. Milos is the kind of place you need to treat yourself to, go in willing and able to indulge in it 100% and recover later."}
{"text":"One of my worst restaurant experiences, the ambience of a sports bar, worn out silver ware and china, a server that splashes wine all over the table, bones in the fish and vegetables (rapine.....that's it?) that are over cooked and slopped in a bowl. Even the French fries were limp. Only politeness to my host kept me sat there, I may never step into another Greek restaurant, they really are not the best cooks. Of course I also did not see any Greeks in the kitchen so maybe I should have known what was coming. Never again"}
{"text":"Great place... Great food great...great service. Nothing bad to say about this place. If you like fish or seafood, this is the place to go. My best advice is let your server pick for you."}
{"text":"Awesome, yes a good 15 minute cab ride from downtown but worth $30CA round trip!    I had the prefix lunch with bacalao croquettes, Royal Dorade and finished with the baklava ice cream. Every plate was perfect the croquettes were so light I don't know how the kept them on the plate. Beautiful decor, Joelle was cute, professional and made me feel like I was her only customer. I will be back for the octopus!"}
{"text":"I went there during the \"Montreal à table\" festival. Was extremely disappointed!! I was told this is one of the best Greek restaurants in Montreal - especially for fish. What a joke ! I am very picky with fish and octopus (which I love perfectly cooked) : the octopus was burnt and hard, the halibut was overcooked Very expensive also despite the festival special  Will never go there again  Much better places in Montreal for half the price"}
{"text":"Incredibly classy place with excellent service an obviously wide selection of fresh dish and sea food. The bass was really delicious !!!! Obviously a nice place for any special occasion $$$$"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible ambiance and the menu is as exquisite as the food taste. The staff here are trained professionals and they take a tremendous amount of pride on making sure you have an amazing experience. If you aren't a fish lover -- this place might just give you a change of heart.   The freshness of their seafood was impressive. Everything from the colossal shrimp with brandy were very tasty. Drinking the brandy out of the head, mixed with the seasoning and natural flavor of the shrimp was unlike anything I have tasted. The grilled octopus the smoky flavor and had incredible texture - these plates were cooked to perfection. Even the salt encrusted sea bass, served table side, was mindblowing -- the texture was amazing. The fish was so flaky and every bite was full of flavor. The service was on point and the bartenders looked like they were trained mixologist.  DIning at Milo's was definitely a memorable experience. The pictures just can't do the food justice. Everything we tasted was cooked and seasoned beyond belief.   They have locations in Miami, New York City and Montreal. I can only imagine that the food is unbelievably incredible no matter what the location is. I plan on checking out their location in NYC - I will keep you posted."}
{"text":"I went to Milos with high expectations and was really looking forward to/expected a great meal via the high praise people seemed to give it.  First they bring mediocre/tasteless toasted bread to the table - a sure sign of things to come.  Then we ordered the octopus appetizer - which was good, not great.  While I understand letting the octopus be the star of the dish, I found the flavor experience to be lacking.  Having had delicious octopus in Greece and Spain, Milos' octopus was just 'ok'.    Their wine was grossly overpriced relative to the quality in my opinion.    Additionally, if you're going to charge 150 CAD for a 3 pound lobster it had better be delicious/one of the best lobsters I've ever eaten...not so much.  Over hyped, and supported by what appeared to be a pretentious clientele who went for the name, we're willing to grossly overspend, and we're happy about it.  Not a place for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible! I live in Miami Beach, where there is an outpost, but had never been. I just couldn't fathom how exquisite food can be until I dined at the original.   We had a noon reservation for lunch and the restaurant filled up quickly. The staff here is a tad more formal than I found at other Montreal fine dining establishments, but were happy to accommodate our fish-peeping and photo taking.   We started with a dry Greek sparkling wine. I was a little hungover from the previous debauched night out, so I had just a sip and was impressed. We next had a sampling of 5 oysters from different regions in the area, ranging from PEI to Maine. They arrived on a bed of ice with all of their liquor and were fresh and delicious. Following the oysters was the grilled octopus. Unreal! It had a wood-grilled smoky flavor and was incredibly tender.   We next went with the prix-fixe lunch; 3 courses for CA$25. We started with lentil soup, smoked salmon and salmon tartare. All were fresh and beautifully presented. Two in our party then had the lamb chops; two had the whole white fish and one had the tuna burger. The tuna burger was ordered solely for the side of fried zucchini and was the only miss of the day, as it was a bit dry and probably not the best way to experience fresh fish. I didn't try the lamb chops, but the fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. A delight! We all finished with the baklava ice cream, the taste of which I can still recall!  My only complaint was that the restaurant got loud. We were in a corner with poor acoustics and was also significantly warmer around our table than in the rest of the room. However, the service was impeccable and this meal was a true highlight of my Montreal trip!"}
{"text":"I had some of the best Greek food I've ever tasted at Milos.   It was my cousin and his fiancee's rehearsal dinner. We had the entire restaurant with almost 200 people. And even with the huge crowd, the food and service were both excellent.  Top dishes:  - Thinly sliced fried zucchini, served with a tahini sauce. An OMG dish.  - \"The best crab cakes in town,\" claimed one server. And they were quite delicious.   - Charcoal grilled shrimp   - Grilled lamb chops  - Filet mignon  - White fish, served simply with olive oil   - Salad with feta and tomatoes   Even my grandma, who HATES Greek food, thought this was the best meal of the wedding weekend. And I would 100% agree with her. I would have all of these dishes again. The zucchini, shrimp and lamb chops were particularly wonderful.   I would certainly return in Montreal or visit the New York restaurant."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Milo's. Superb fish. Exquisite starters. And I adore the Milo's Special. Service is also spectacular."}
{"text":"WOW! Simply wow! We went to try Milos on a Wednesday night without a booking and the place was full! We were first seated at the bar, but just as our waiter approached us, they got a cancellation and therefor were able to move us to a table. We couldn't decide whether to get the tomato or green salad as appetizer and when we mentioned this to the waiter, he let us have half-half so we get the best of both! Both salads were delicious and fresh! For the main meal (or entree), we decided to get the halibut Mediterranean style to split between the two of us. The waiter also recommended additional vegetable on the side (asparagus in our case) to compliment the fish and made it a full meal for both of us. The halibut was magnificent! It was fresh, perfectly cooked, moist and great taste! Even the asparagus was also cooked wonderfully, not too hard and not too soft. This place is simply a gem! Great food, good atmosphere and excellent service!"}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of fresh seafood so by default this place is a huge win! Love it when they have a nice showcase of their fresh seafood for their customers to consume!  Unfortunately they seem to be slightly overcooking the fish here which is a little of a downer as I had an amazing experience in their Las Vegas location. They also serve much larger fish here so it's not as young so the meat might be little more tougher by default regardless of how well you cook it. So without this confirmation, I'll let it slip by as a minor issue.  I came here 3 times within a week that's how much of a fan I am.   Items ordered:  Appetizers:  Crab cake - very delicious and highly recommend it; just wished they would serve more crab cakes for that price! It was served with a spicy mayo sauce which goes perfectly with their crab  Grilled Octopus - very delicious as well and highly recommend it but maybe I was either sick of eating it but the 2nd time I ordered this it wasn't as good tasting and didn't seem quite as fresh as the first time. It was a little more tougher than usual and the color didn't seem as fresh. Hopefully i would not repeat the same issue in my future visits next time I'm in town  Grilled Lavraki - very delicious fish but wished they served smaller portions like the Las Vegas location. Meat was tougher than usually so I would probably still reserve my Lavraki cravings at the Las Vegas location  Halibut - this was supposedly the best fish dish in Montreal but I wasn't so impressed with this one. Halibut is a very delicate fish and can easily be overcooked even by the finest restaurants and unfortunately it was overcooked here as well. Nothing is worse than a tough texture especially with Halibut. Halibut is too expensive and prone to being overcooked that I would not order Halibut in restaurants often. So for that reason, I would not really recommend ordering this.  Lobster pasta - this was amazing. I saw them actually take out the 1.5lb of fresh whole Maine lobster from their tanks to make this dish. Usually restaurants don't serve fresh whole Maine lobsters and just serve frozen Lobster tails but they did not disappoint. They even provided the claw meat which was awesome! I usually prefer lighter Lobsters as it's usually more flavorful and the meat isn't as tough. Wanted to order just the Lobster but they said minimum weight would be about 3-4 lbs which is too heavy/old of a Lobster for me. Their pasta was perfectly cooked \"al dente\" and their tomato sauce was the bomb. I wished they would sell it in retail or something as I'd buy their tomato sauce in a heartbeat!  Probably the best seafood restaurant in Montreal and definitely recommend giving this place a try but be warned, it'll cost you! They have free valet parking as well which is a nice plus as usually it's hard to find parking in that part of town."}
{"text":"Le menu de lunch vaut absolument la peine pour tous ceux qui hésitent d'essayer Milos à cause des prix! C'est parfait pour un lunch entre collègues. Le menu comprend trois plats - entrée, plat principal et désert. J'ai pris le tartare pour commencer, ensuite le poisson entier et la crème glacée baklava fait maison. Bonne bouffe, bon service, beau restaurant. J'ai entendu dire que les croquettes de crabes sont fantastiques. J'y retournerai, c'est certain!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Montreal! If you are looking for a great fine dining spot, Milo's is the place.   I came here with a few buddies, the oysters were extremely fresh, the grilled shrimps were great,  the octopus was one of the best I've ever had, and the milos special was on another level delicious!   If you come after 10 PM, they have a prefix menu that has an appetizer, entry, and desert for about 20 bucks. (A few of the dishes are an extra $15)   I got the lobster pasta which was an extra $15. It was good, my only complaint was the sauce they used . The lobster pieces were big and delicious but the sauce had a bit of a weird taste to it (it was sweet).  Overall had a great experience, and will defiantly be back here when I'm in Montreal. Will try out the New York location as well."}
{"text":"Came to Milos on a Thursday night around 11pm for their late night menu (available Thur to Sat 10pm-midnight). For those not from Montreal and don't have a car, the restaurant is difficult to reach via metro and easier by bus. Was seated at the bar as a single diner. Service was OK as bartender was busy fulfilling other orders. No cocktail menu.  For the late night menu: for $25.16 you get a starter (salmon, salad or Greek platter) and a main (tuna burger, lobster pasta, filet mignon, dorade fish) followed by dessert (baklava or ice cream). I went with the organic salmon sashimi, filet mignon steak (was $10 extra upgrade) and baklava. The salmon sashimi was good but nothing special. The pieces were small and thin. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and came with the big pieces of broccoli and perfectly oven roasted potatoes. Note portion size on both the appetizer and main were towards the smaller side. The baklava was pretty boring.   For those who want to save some money and still have a nice meal, the Milos late night specials are for you. Otherwise, I would pass. The Lemeac late night menu is far better."}
{"text":"Everything I've read about Milos is true Loveeeeeeeeeeeeeee this place.  Took my Mom and Sister for their Birthdays and the staff, decor and atmosphere was amazing. My Mom was a little cold and walla out comes a table cloth placed around my Mom like a shawl, problem solved.  The Calamari and Greek salad starters were  excellent just the right amount of olive oil no dips necessary.  Our meals were to die for I had the Lobster Linguine loved it.  Our server took the time to explain the fresh water fish texures making the selection easy for my Sister and Mom. The surprise birthday treat was sweet with a fruit salad.  This is a must visit if and when you come to this fabulous city."}
{"text":"After almost 40 years, Milos remains the best seafood restaurant in Montreal. Not only is the food and service perfect, the restaurant has recently been renovated. Every seafood dish we had tonight-the crevice, crab cakes,salmon and halibut were as good as any we've had. The Brussels sprout and beet sides were simple but exquisite. The entire dining experience is uplifting. It almost makes you question why you should eat anywhere else in town."}
{"text":"Very good seafood,Very fresh sea bass.just a bit on the pricey side"}
{"text":"If you ever have a birthday to celebrate, this is the greatest spot you could chose. We had my wife's birthday at a table for 17 and it was a feast of Roman proportions the service was beyond anything I have ever experienced anywhere. The food was nonstop for 3 hours of a quality that gave us all the feeling the boat was tied up next door the food was so fresh. We were served almost the whole menu from octopus to fried mushrooms and Greek salad. The cooked in salt Mediterranean Sea bass was so good that a few guests wanted some to take home. I must Thank all the staff for a most memorable experience."}
{"text":"We had the set lunch here and found it to be a solid, if slightly out of the way, option.  The waitstaff was attentive and helpful.  My wife had the tomato salad and tuna burger and I had the horcopita and chicken skewers.  The yogurt sauce was terrific and they use mint here which is different than boston.  The tomato salad was huge and the burger had a very beeflike consistency.  The horcopita did not have too much pastry so you didnt feel bad eating it all.  The chicken was flavorful though probably could have benefitted from a few extra minutes of cooking.    However, the highlight was dessert.  The baklava ice cream was heavenly.  Lots of nuts for crunch and plenty of sweetness.  It was just a small scoop so a good size but I could have eaten a half gallon.  I think Id go back just for this.  We tried some greek wine (2010 Malagousia G) and found it oaky with just enough sweetness to counteract the oak."}
{"text":"Well, here is why Milos Montreal is getting 3 stars. They made us wait for a long time and the halibut was very bland. We are visiting from Los Angeles and decided to have dinner at Milos last night. I called around 7pm for a reservation for 3 people (2 adults and a 9 year old), and I was told that they can accommodate us for 9:00pm. I wish they had just told us that they were fully booked. We took Uber and arrived at the restaurant around 8:55. Upon arrival, we were told that our table will be ready in 2-3 minutes, but we weren't seated until about 9:35pm. Since we had a 9 year old with us, we just stood in the small hallway, instead of sitting at the bar that was almost full. They did apologize around 9:20pm and invited us to sit at the bar that had 1 customer left, and served us a delicious Meze plate around 9:25pm. Unfortunately, by this time I was already extremely agitated. The restaurant is very clean and VERY nicely decorated. Service is good. Most diners were regulars out with their families, and most of them seem to know each other. The waiters were very friendly with the regulars, which was nice to see. We got the octopus=excellent. The crab cake was good. The lamb chops were great, so was the lobster pasta, however, not sure what happened to my halibut. Sadly, it had no taste at all. The key lime pie was good, but the greek coffee they served tasted horrible. I drink greek coffee regularly, so the taste is nothing new to me. This coffee was so bad, I barley finished half of it. So sad that my Milos Montreal experience took a negative turn."}
{"text":"Milos had longevity for a reason: consistency of quality.  This place is gorgeous  The service is flawless The food will have you Moan  Very very fresh products  My favorite items on the menu are the Milos special, which is basically lightly fried zuchinis, eggplant with tzaziki and cheese.  You don't feel any grease that's how good they are.  The octopus was as fresh and good if not better than what I had seaside in Europe.  The lamb was tender and perfectly seasoned.  Everybody raved about the lobster pasta.  I didn't get to try a fish yet but it will be next.  Thumbs up Milos"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend for lunch. Lunch special consists of starter, entree and dessert.  I had a Begula salad, grilled salmon with rice and yoghurt martini with sweets.  The taste and plating of each course was absolutely exquisite.  The service was wonderful.  I also need to mention the bathroom, so clean and fancy.  I would definitely return to this establishment when I'm in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Best sea food restaurant in town.  Top service!"}
{"text":"You think that it looks good from the pictures, but you really have no idea. I had been here as a child but I didn't remember it too well and was besieged by family members to return, I'm so glad I took their advice.  We started with the Milos special, a tower of crispy eggplant and zucchini slices on a bed of creamy and tangy tzatziki, accompanied by four pieces of fried haloumi cheese. The haloumi was like a pungent feta, but the texture was excellent melted. The waiter saw us struggling to be proper, eating the tower with forks, and urged us to be comfortable in using our fingers. He was right, it did taste better that way.  For an entree my boyfriend got the lamb chops, which were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I got the lobster pasta and it did not disappoint. There were huge chunks of lobster and the  tomato sauce had a creaminess too it, its magnificence cannot really be described beyond that.  I only wish I had come with a bigger party so that we could have tasted more of the dishes, the two of us were stuffed from one appetizer and our 2 entrees."}
{"text":"Im a fan of Milos .Montreal ,Miami and Nyc are the ones I been . It's a fancy Greek in a beautiful ambiance . The food is very good and very fresh"}
{"text":"Had lunch with co-workers. We opted for the lunch table d'hôte. We were impressed with portion sizes and ingredient freshness. The ventilation system needs to be adressed, until then bring a jacket as it is windy in the dining room. Great waiters hustling you for add-ons don't take away from the overall positive meal experience.  Make time to visit their breathtaking washrooms while your there. Now I understand that the menu is discounted for lunch I'm not sure what the supper offerings are. Good luck finding parking and Bon apetit."}
{"text":"Upscale Greek food, delicious Greek food! We came here around 1:00pm on a Friday with a group of 5 and waited about 30-45 min for a table. The hostess was super nice and held all of our luggage downstairs as we weren't able to check into our place yet. We felt underdressed as some of us had traveling workout attire on. When we were seated our server was somewhat rude the entire lunch. I'd give this place 5 stars if he had been nicer to us. I'd highly recommend getting the prefix lunch menu, the value is unbelievable from the cost of only $25 for appetizer, full size entree and dessert. I attached pictures of these all. I really wanted to get the zucchini and eggplant platter but couldn't justify paying $30 for vegetables. I ordered the tomato feta salad which was super fresh and light. I got the whole fish for an entree which didn't have as many bones as I was expecting that came with fresh veggies. The baklava ice cream, please get this! Ours were a little watery like they had sat out for too long but still so delicious!"}
{"text":"It is very hard to please people who love traditional French style cuisines with other country cuisine. Estiatorio Milos could help you if you have that kind of dilemma. If you or/and your friend(s) like seafood and want to experience luxury dining, Milos offers various choices of seafood. Fresh fishes are just flown from Mediterranean and North-American sea. Be sure to take the tour to select your own fish(s). Each fish you selected will give you the amazing and unique taste that Milos can offer.   * Service: Excellent (a bit slow for who has not been experienced European dinning) * Price: Pricy as all high-end restaurants would (be sure to ask price prior to complete your order if you are in doubt or want to stay in your budget)  * Atmosphere: Excellent  * Food Quality: Superb and great wine selections as well.  * Parking: Valet parking is available or parking nearby the street (Metro is nearby and you can use public transportation if possible)  * Avoid factor: Do not order too many dishes which one fish may be more than enough for two people and you still can have the great dining experience at Milos. If you want to dine there for once in a lifetime deal, you may not want to order expensive wine (either a glass or a bottle) along with your main dish. You can always taste wine separately elsewhere (remember you go there to try their awesome food).  * Recommendation: Try their awesome \"Grilled Vegetables\"."}
{"text":"Open and beautiful decor.  Excellent service. The food is contemporary, high end and delicious!  We really enjoyed this place!!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Loved the lobster pasta and the salt covered fish. Service was amazing and the waiter was great. Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once during lunchtime and another at dinnertime. Both times I was wowed by the outstanding fresh seafood.   For the appetizer we had the crab cake which we were told was made up of 95% crab meat. It was amazingly sweet. For the main course we had a grilled Mediterranean snapper (Balada) selected from the fresh fish bar. Drizzled with olive oil, light herbs and a dash of lemon, it was tender and flavorful - quite unforgettable.   However, note that it's $45/lb so the dish cost $67 for a 1.5 lb fish. I haven't tried other similar Mediterranean restaurants, so I can't assess if this is considered the going rate.   Service was prompt despite the restaurant being crowded on a holiday evening. There were ample waiters going around filling up glasses and clearing the plates. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the items on the menu, and gave a thorough introduction of the fish at the fresh fish bar.   Decor of the restaurant was tasteful and provides a warm atmosphere for dining - whether you're on a date, going with your family, or dining with business associates. We noticed many families around us."}
{"text":"One of the best seafood restaurants in Montreal. Oysters, octopus, crab cake, grilled fish...every dish is cooked just right, every time."}
{"text":"I have to say going to Milo's is not like going to just another restaurant. It is an event, something really to look forward to. This is a very classy restaurant that features valet parking service with pride and waiters at your fingertips to fulfill your every need. The seafood is always fresh and some of it imported, the waiters/waitresses are knowledgable and the herbs are grown in house. Almost every dish is made with their signature olive oil and it is spectacular. If you are offered a chance to try this restaurant don't hesitate. Easily one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"An absolutely stellar meal.   Everything was just right. Even with 7 guests we enjoyed a meal that flowed thanks to the most impressive service. The task of these waiters was admirable, the layout of the restaurant is pretty cramped but somehow they navigate all of the obstacles. There was never a wasted moment for them, they are constantly fluttering around with massive dishes.   Our party wanted to start with a variety of appetizers so we asked the waiter to give us the restaurant's best and we had 5 different platters to share (exquisite fried calamari, grilled octopus, greek salad, peppers, and one I am forgetting). They were very accomodating and the waiter quickly came up with which dishes to have and then a nice white wine to match.   We then ordered our own main courses and I was blown out of the water by the lobster pasta. Wow, it was so rich with a healthy dose of butter and the lobster tasted delicious.   To top it off, we all shared a decadent platter of fruit salad. In the US it is impossible to find strawberries as delicious as the ones we were lucky enough to have. They had a deep sweetness and tart which is rarely seen in the US. All of the other fruits were wonderful.   An incredible meal and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food and wine service at this amazing Greek restaurant are beyond compare. I enjoyed a delicious tomato salad as well as a cut of swordfish that was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Despite an odd trip during a dark and cold season in Québec, Milos managed to distinguish itself. I look forward to returning under different circumstances."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. Food was very good. There were lots of fresh fish selections. You can go right up and select your own fish, that prepare for you. I definitely recommend it for a special night out."}
{"text":"Greek food at its best! I was skeptical at first not having had good experiences with this type of cuisine thus far, but so many people recommended it, I had to try. I cannot say enough good things about this place, the quality and freshness of the ingredients, the preparation and presentation, the service, and of course the taste, everything was perfect. We sat next to the seafood market display, which is a nice touch to their decor, and we ordered the Milos Special, followed by a seafood pasta, and the lamb chops. Delicious! When I saw the impressive variety of dishes being carried out to other customers, I knew I would have to be back."}
{"text":"Okay.  So read the reviews this afternoon after I had booked a table 3 weeks ago and almost considered canceling.  So glad I did not.  One of the best meals in a long time and this is from Washington Dc native who frequently dines out in Boston and NYC.  Agree it is expensive but really worth it.  And service was awesome coming from a tourist."}
{"text":"Good food but can be found in some other great Greek restos in montreal to more or less same level. So when one goes to a resto of this caliber it is not merely for the food but also for the service and the whole dining experience. In fact the service becomes even more important than the food when you pay such high prices. In our recent visit when we took a guest our experience was really not good. My husband's steak arrived after we had almost finished eating our fish. At first we kept waiting as the waiter kept saying few more minutes but then we reluctantly started eating our dish which was smart because his meal arrived when we were done. You can imagine how unpleasant this was at 400$ plus for 3 people. Milos waiter could have still saved this bad dinning moment for us by merely offering a simple coffee on the house but he just pretended all was normal. Is his attitude a representative of the establishment ? We all know things can happen in a busy resto and even the most organized establishments can make mistakes but it is how you train your staff to deal with it that keeps your customers coming back. We def. will no longer go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! What a dining experience it was coming to Milo's in Montreal. Everything from the service to the wine and food was amazing.   Highlights: - the octopus appetizer.. It was possibly the best dish I have ever had in my life. An absolute must for all diners - the Olive oil with fresh oregano cut at the table. Simple and fresh  - the Greek wine! Our server recommended a fantastic white that the entire table enjoyed   Go to Milo's if you're in Montreal- you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the appetizers 4 stars for the entrees 3 stars for the desserts  Sad how the meal gets worse as it goes along, lol, but still a great meal overall.  Began our meal with calamari, octopus, a crab cake.  Funny how I'm from Maryland but was still willing to pay the high price for this maryland crab crab cake.... It tasted great though. The octopus was my favorite. We even ordered a 2nd round of it.  For my entree, I went with the lamb chops. It came with a delicious greek house salad. The lamb chops itself was good but nothing spectacular in taste. It also wasn't the largest chop and had less fat than I'd prefer. My aunt's fish was good. Just olive oil and lemon on it; simple.   Finish the meal off with ice cream and baklava, neither of which were  impressive.  The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and our waiter was magnificent (except when it came time to pay as that took him quite a while...). But I did enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant and the food presentation was very elegant."}
{"text":"Fun fact (if you didn't know already): Milos is a well renowned restaurant with multiple locations throughout US and Europe but the magic all started right here in Montreal :)   With fresh fish flown in daily from the Mediterranean sea and a quite impressive privately imported wine list heavy on the less known but surprisingly elegant Greek wine, it is heavy on the wallet. Needless to say, this is definitely a special occasion kinda restaurant.  The decor is bright and very white, yet very inviting. It's almost as if you were having a meal in one of those cute little white houses in Santorini.  Service was top notch. Our waiter made great recommendations and made us feel at home despite us being the youngest table in a rather posh crowd.  Food was the freshest we've ever had! The crab cake was made with crab so real that you could still taste some of the cartilage from the shell it was just in. And it was made with just crab, no filling! The fish aka the Lavraki (european seabass) had been caught only the day before... in Greece! and was baked in seasalt, requiring only a drizzle of olive oil to complement it's tender meat. Fresher than that and you might as well buy a ticket to Athens!  Although none of their menu items reinvent the wheel, they bank on being the best at what they are renowned for. Which is serving a fresh and authentic Greek dining experience without having to fly you 8 hours to experience it. A truly enjoyable fine dining experience that we will look forward to repeating... at the next very special occasion!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious! Fresh, flavourful... best of the best. I wish I could give a full 5 star rating, but I really didn't appreciate the attitude I got from the waiter last time I went. Also, word of advice for future diners: do not give your server carte blanche to choose wine for you. Always ask for the menu, otherwise they'll bring you the most expensive option. Seems to be a common practice here. Lesson learned... twice! Regardless, great spot, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"My favorite seafood restaurant, i will say it, ever! Oysters, shrimp(giant), octopus, salted fish, lobster all so fresh, simple and  delicious! We had a small group so we dined in the more private basement area. We got everything family style and shared.  The salted fish and octopus were standouts as was the greek yogurt with honey for dessert. The wine was delicious. Service outstanding. I can not wait to visit again next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"If I posted a picture of the incredible Milos sampler appetizer that  my boyfriend and I devoured (even though four people should share it), it would be like posting another picture of the Eiffel Tower. Most incredible appetizer...  We were seated by the open kitchen, which my boyfriend loved since he is a restaurant owner and an incredible chef. We watched the symphony of coordination between the kitchen and the servers.  The unique bread service: snipping fresh herbs onto our olive oil plate!  When I found out that this Milos has been around for over 30 years and they were going to open in London, it was great - not because I live in London but that an immigrant from Greece came over here and is another success story - love it!  The Greek salad left us speechless...not because it was so expensive but because it was outrageously great.  Fantastic service, great food, exciting tableside presentation with whole fish (which is weighed by the pound) - saw a 5 lb lobster being prepared too.   Go to Milos...enough said."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend and his family. We ate fried zucchini chips, salmon filet, and baklava ice cream The atmosphere was lovely and the service was septacular. I would definitely come back here again. Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"Went there for special dinner for dinner. I found the place too noisy, but it was nicely decorated. The appetizers were good. Crab cakes, calamari and fried eggplants and zucchini. But my would arrived much much later than my companions, which is unacceptable from a restaurant with a caliber and prices as Milos! What was even more unacceptable was the waiter telling me to keep myself busy with my companions' side dishes until my steak arrives!!! By the time my food arrived they were finished. My idea of having dinner with friends is not watching them eat! As for me I can not recommend this place, there are much nicer places with better service and same quality of food to waste your time with Milos"}
{"text":"The lobster pasta was mouthwatering and the highlight of my night. If I can describe this dish in few words it would be: Perfection and worth every single penny (I guess this is more than a few words, but you get what I mean). The thought of this dish still makes me salivate to this day.  Where have I been all this time?  Read my review: bornandbraised.ca/2017/02/05/estiatorio-milos/"}
{"text":"Staff: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Food: 3/5  I think I'm the only person in Montreal who's not an exceptional fan of Milos. Don't get me wrong, everything is well cooked, and the restaurant is absolutely lovely with great staff, but the food is exceptionally overpriced (appx $100/person), and mildly underwhelming.  We had dishes in total: Fried Calamari, Lobster Pasta, a Greek Salad, Grill Shrimped, Charred Octopus, Fried Zucchini and Eggplant chips. But I'll break it down one by one.  Entrées:   The Fried Calamari was exceptional. It's lightly battered, nice amount of salt and pepper, and the freshly squeezed lemon added a dimension to the Calamari that pushed it off the edge of being subpar. I find it difficult to cook fried calamari well, and I thought Milos did a great job, and there wasn't an unpleasant rubbery texture that you find with so many other restaurants that also serve fried calamari.   The Charred Octopus was cooked well. It wasn't rubbery, and it wasn't dry and that tends to be what you look for in a good octopus dish. That said, the Octopus had no flavour, and even when you mixed with the capers and the onions, it didn't really help the octopus itself. Mixed with the char on the octopus, it made a bitter vinegary taste that wasn't terrible, but just didn't stand out.  I guess the same could be said about the Grilled Shrimp. The grilled shrimp comes with beans and a small micro greens salad. It's a lovely concept but neither the beans nor the shrimp had any flavour, and it was underwhelming at best.  The Greek Salad was incredibly fresh, but lacked salt.   Fried Zucchini and Eggplant Chips were EXCEPTIONAL. By far, my favourite part of the meal. It's not oily, has a great tzatziki sauce in the middle, and there are these fried cheeses on the side of the dish that you eat with the chip, and it's just incredible flavours and textures in your mouth. If I'm going back to Milos, I'm going back for this.  The Tuna was lovely. It's cooked rare and it's everything a good tuna dish should be. Rich in flavour, it's very well done.   The Lobster pasta was way too expensive for what it was. The lobster is well cooked, but there's not much of it, and the pasta is (very) lacking in flavour - especially salt, but if you add a lot of lemon, the dish becomes much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Looks and feels very elite with an air of ostentatious qualities.  Even the bar guy was calling this restaurant \"renown\", \"classy\", \"superb\" and so forth. Using all these adjectives, my goodness...   Looking around, it is very spacious and the customers ranged from locals to tourists.    This is NOT an affordable restaurant but got lucky that we reached a time when the prefix dinner menu for like 25-30 bucks were available, whoo hoo!   The dinner came out excellent.  I ordered the Dorade fish, which was cooked just right.  My friend ordered a huge lobster and although it was $90, it was WORTH IT!  It was sweet and lovely...a great experience!  So is this a recommended place to eat?  Yes, if you can wait till the prefix menu is in effect, to save on costs.  Yes, if you love seafood.  Yes, if you want to have a beautiful dinner without minding the bill.  The desserts were also good too.  I'd come here again and will check out the one in NYC.  Also on the menu that I would try next time would be the salt-baked fish.  I've only seen it done on TV... but a loooot of people were ordering that.  Also, Montreal has a bunch of different charges/taxes, so be aware!   There is valet parking, coat check and the whole nine."}
{"text":"My server was unbelievable she took such good care of me I could not even bring up the fact my one dish halibut was raw. Salmon was terrific wine was good as well not a bad meal but for cost I would expect the food to be handled perfectly. It's a good place to drop in and I will return because of the service but not happy with raw fish! Crab cake was good as well just a bit small. So I give it a 3.5 but yelp won't allow that. I think the prices could come down a bit. My one bad experience should not hold you back from trying this poshy place!"}
{"text":"Mes parents m'ont fait découvrir ce restaurant dans mon jeune temps à l'époque où ils réglaient encore la facture (car elle était conséquente!). J'ai vraiment été charmée par l'endroit, un restaurant moderne, chic et accueillant avec un comptoir présentant les fruits de mer du moment. Chaque plat est savoureux, tant les poissons que les pâtes. J'ai eu un coup de coeur pour l'entrée de crabe. Une boulette généreuse fondante en bouche et juste excquise au goûter. Maintenant j'y retourne et je prends encore le crabe et comme plat les pâtes aux homards, des morceaux de homards tendres et une sauce aux tomates bien assaisonnée. Je recommande fortement ce restaurant tant pour la qualité de la nourriture que pour le service courtois et très professionnel de tous les employés. Si vous voulez gâter un proche c'est un must!!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best. Service, food, quality. Everything you'd ever want in a seafood restaurant is what you'll get at Milos.   The service is impeccable, they'll treat you like family and cater to your every needs. The food... From the octopus, to the zucchini and the best shrimp you'll ever have; the only thing holding you back from ordering more are the prices. It's expensive, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Ok, so our meal was like a stereotype: Greek salad, grilled octopus, salted Mediterranean bass, baklava. But how can you mess with perfection?  Milo's does the best Greek salad in Montreal! ...no discussion. Roll that in with these guys sourcing such flavorful tomatoes in May in Canada...!  Grilled octopus was tender, flavored with the smoke of a real grill. No toughness at all.  Oh, did I mention the Milo's Special? We ordered that first of all. It was a tasty combination of eggplant and zucchini slices, lightly fried with a couple pieces of cheese and taziki sauce: perfect for nibbling while the conversation winds up.  Salted fish is a specialty...for a reason. The product was brought to the table and broken out of its salt, with much ceremony, right in front of you.  Service was exemplary. Plates and silver changed between each course, table expertly 'crumbed' before dessert and coffee...you just don't see that enough anymore.  Staff was professional, approachable, knowledgable. Presentation was attractive and artistic. Food was awesome!"}
{"text":"When I think of Milos it brings me back to the décor of the restaurant in which the nautical theme matches their menu. Milos is an institution, whether it is the location in Miami or in Montreal, both are exquisite. I was most recently in the Athens location which caught my attention because it did not have the typical style of an upscale restaurant. Instead the waiter with a pleasant decorum came over to the table, like an old friend, and asked what we wanted out of the meal. We started off with a cevice made fresh from a fish that we picked at their pseudo-fish market at the front. We then moved on to a wonderful Greek salad and finished off with fish done two different ways. This meal was perfection because the chef really lets the ingredients shine. My favorite thing to eat at any milos location is the Barbooni which is fried whole and the bones turn to a liquid and you can eat the entire fish. This restaurant has provided some of my favorite dining experiences due to the wonderful ambiance and even better food. It is always a treat when I get to return to Milos and I cannot wait for my next visit, until next time!"}
{"text":"Listen... if this restaurant were a car, it would be a Ferrari.  You're in Montreal, you want to go somewhere where you are CERTAIN you will not be disappointed?  This is the place.  Everything is absolute perfection. Service is impeccable.  The menu is simple.  Fresh seafood for the most part.  Now, I love seafood.  But I also love adventurous dishes prepared with flare with the flavors to back it up.  These wasn't a lot of flair.  Definitely not adventurous.  But FRESH and PERFECTLY prepared?  Yes.  Everything.  A little pricey (My seabass was $43/lb, which came out to almost $100).  But it was well worth it.  Again, if you don't want to take chances and you want to go to a restaurant where you'll leave feeling like you just experienced some of the best dining the city has to offer, Milo's is your place.  One last thing... you must order dessert.  I have never had a Greek dessert that I actually loved... and I lived in Athens for a year.  The Baklava here is the best I've ever had, but even that doesn't compare the ridiculously rich and delicious Galaktoboureko, which is basically just a custard in a pastry, but wow.  I could eat that every day for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Had an amazing party here. The service is amazing. Other people's food was really good. However my pasta with lobster was mediocre. The lobster was good but the pasta was just pasta. I would recommend other items on the menu besides the pasta lobster. Overall I had a really good time and the waiters were very accommodating to our large group with alot of people just showing up :P"}
{"text":"If you want fancy Greek food this is the place to go!  The first time I came to this restaurant was for MTL a Table a few years ago. I just remember that the grilled octopus was very good but the steak I had was just ok. I went back Tuesday for MTL a table and it was my favorite MTL a table this year by far!  By the way they don't have butter in case you don't like bread with olive oil. I however really enjoyed their olive oil and asked for more of it.   Again I had the grilled octopus starter and it was just as good as I had remembered. My aunt enjoyed it too. The octopus was delicious. The grilled octopus was on a bed of onions and capers and olive oil.     The grilled lamb was amazing!!! I asked for it to be cooked medium rare. It was so juicy and salted. It came with broccoli and potatoes. My aunt had the grilled salmon. She found it was a little undercooked inside but she did ask for medium and she doesn't eat raw fish. Also one time I went with two of my friends and one of them ordered a whole fish and he kept spitting out the scales!! Scales!! OMG the horror!! Despite that I'm still giving it five stars because what I ate at Milos was fabulous. Plus it was probably an off night that one time because the last time I went I saw some people ordered a whole fish and it seemed fine...there was no scales whatsoever.   Oh by the way, the wine menu consists only of Greek wine. I tried two different red wines and they weren't bad at all.  For dessert I had the baklava duo. The baklava was the best I ever had. It was not too sweet at all.  AND it came with baklava ice cream! OMG so good! I never had baklava ice cream before.   The restaurant is so nice.  It has two floors. When you walk in there's a nice bar. The walls are white with white curtains and Greek art. The bottom floor has walls of wine cellar. The bathrooms are so fancy and super spacious!   I will definitely be back and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I am usually against restaurants who serve simple food at ridiculous prices. That's not what Milos is... the food is exceptional and so is the service. They are so polite/formal but still friendly and approachable.  The food... basically everything is delicious. Grilled red snapper, grilled mushrooms, crab cakes, greek salad, green salad... everything is just perfect.  I have never had a dish here that wasn't good! Sometimes you just have to indulge even if that means paying a little more."}
{"text":"Came to Milos for the MTL a table event. We were kindly greeted at the front and seated in the back. The place was full! Our waiter started us out with some bread with fresh oregano. Yum! I had the grilled octopus which was amazingly good. Then had the lamb chops. I felt the lamb chops we're a bit oversalted. However, they were cooked nicely. Their specialty cocktails on the menu are fun to try. I would definately come back! It is a bit on the fancier side, so this is a perfect restaurant for a special occasion or a birthday."}
{"text":"Divine. We had to wait 15 minutes for our table and I thought that I would not be able to forgive them and that this review would need a 4 star. I was wrong. The food was superb and the service even better. The milo special was one of the greatest things I've ever tasted. By the end of the night we were passing our plates around the table, wanting everyone to indulge in the different flavours.   This will definitely not be the last time I come to Milos!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before heading off to the OSM for the evening. I was almost dreading going to a nicer place this evening given that I was in a cocktail dress and rocking Sorels thanks to the snowfall earlier that day, but the hostess happily checked my furry boots so that I could change into my heels before being seated.  The fresh baked bread was tasty as was the wine we picked (didn't go for the Greek selection, just couldn't do it!) I had the big eye tuna which was done sashimi-style. It was hands down the best fish I have had in Montreal: fresh, cooked just right and melted in my mouth. The beet variety on the side was oh so tasty as were the greens.  The service was friendly, fast and knowledgeable and my galaktoboureko for dessert was wonderful (although I would suggest sharing it given that it was the size of my head) I will definitely be back as I saw a waiter walk by with a tower of tempura that practically had my name on it, YUM!"}
{"text":"If you want 100% Greek from the water, salt, wine right to the high mountain honey for your yogurt. Milos is the place to go. The Price is not for the everyday person but well worth it if you want to impress a date.  This is where Madonna took her whole staff and closed down the restaurant when she was in town.  Anything and everything on the menu is great."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood and best of all they cook it right there, services top notch and don't forget to ask for fruit as desert they make fresh from fruit bar it's amazing and unforgivable experience"}
{"text":"Good late night dinner special.  The first hiccup is that Milos is under renovations and has relocated to Cava down the street. We booked our reservation online and are from out of town so this caused a bit of confusion before dinner.  We upgraded the late night dinner special to the lobster and steak options. My plate: the lobster spaghetti was delicious. The pasta was plentiful and creamy. The lobster meat was nicely placed over the pasta and the shell was left just as decor. What a great bonus because the last thing you want to do is get all messy for your food on date night! My husband's steak, however, was very small. It tasted great but the portion size was a surprise since it comes with an extra charge. We expected much more for the extra money.   Our biggest complaint has to do with our server. We were left unattended for most of our meal: water glasses and wine glasses were left empty for 10-15 minutes at a time. Even our plates were set and removed by other wait staff. Each time we needed something: bread, water or wine, my husband had to ask another server. Never mind having our server come to our table to ask about our meal! The last time my husband actually had to go to the manager standing by the bar to inform him. Constantly waiting or asking for service is very disruptive to any dinner experience.  I must say that the manager gave us a glass of wine for our trouble and it was a nice gesture. Also that the experience with our waiter would've ruined our dinner if it wasn't for the rest of the wait staff. Everyone else was friendly and attentive to our table.  Can't say we'll be back even though the food is delicious because we don't want to risk the same poor service. Plus the patrons are definitely older - with a few young people scattered around the restaraunt."}
