{"text":"Truly NY quality bagels and the staff is very friendly. I always get 2 dozen and freeze them for the family. Great variety and always fresh."}
{"text":"Lol, I got an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese, it looked nice but I was surprised how fast the cashier brought it to me, well it was not toasted and she seemed not phased at all by it. My girlfriend got a ham and Swiss on a croissant (which might I add was soggy and microwaved) and a coffee (to which she said it would be better at a concierges desk at a holiday inn) for 11.29 cents. Easily the worst breakfast place I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"You do the math...
  bagel $1
+ add egg $1
+ add cheese $1
+ add bacon $1.25!
= customer get's screwed
---
The NY attitude is there, the quality and size of the bagel is not."}
{"text":"I visit this place at least once a week, because I think that it's important to support small businesses and the food is good. 
However, the last three weeks I have had the unpleasant experience of having my order taken and rung up by a young lady who seemed bothered to have to be working there. I think that she is the daughter of the owners and she has been very rude all three times that I have encountered her. The other employees are all lovely and chatty and the food is excellent. 
Unfortunately I am going to have to give up on this place because this young lady does not understand that being rude to customers is not good for business. I will spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"These bring me back to my long island roots...charges were right on the money (no pun intended) and the atmosphere is just like the ny bagelry I remember.  Bagels are crispy on the outside, seeds go around the whole bagel and middle is chewy and perfect!  Go for the twists...really awesome, but sell out fast.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"After 12 years of living in the South, I have finally found a bagel that's close to a Long Island bagel.  The bagels are awesome!  Just be careful, they do put a lot of cream cheese on their bagels.  Well worth the drive from the other side of Matthews.  Also recommend trying one of their black and white cookies!!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels, omelets & cold cuts...as well as cream cheeses, black & white & rainbow cookies...yum yum"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! They recently started serving French toast and it's THE best! They have everything there & it's such a great price for everything!"}
{"text":"Meh...

The bagels were ok (not quite what I'm used to being from the north) and the blueberry cream cheese tasted...off. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, and so cheap! I got three asiago bagels with cream cheese, and two bacon/egg/cheese sesame bagels for $14. It fed three people to the point of napping, and there was a bagel leftover.  

The service was super fast for the line in the morning, and every person was getting table service, and multiple orders filled as well. The staff were courteous, and friendly, and I simply have nothing negative to say at all. Drop the zero, New York bagel, and get with the hero, Poppyseeds!"}
{"text":"I've been living down in NC for two years now and I've been constantly in search of a good bagel. This place FINALLY gave me that bagel sandwich I've been searching for. Folks from NY and NJ know what I mean...big chewy bagels, nice crust...lots and lots of options to build that perfect sandwich. AND this place has \"pork roll\" or as some of you know it, Taylor ham.  I got a pork roll and cheese on a salt bagel. Heaven!  I will be RUNNING back next weekend for more."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  I'm so excited I have a place to get good bagels and real vegetable cream cheese.  They also have some excellent treats that are near impossible to find down here, like chicken livers and taylor ham.  If you are from up north and you want a real bagel, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great tasting NYC style bagels! Former Staten Islander craving a good bagel in CLT. The owners are from NY.  They have NYC bagel store/deli food staples like bialy, black & white cookies, 3 layer cookies, etc.  This is my go to bagel store/deli in CLT."}
{"text":"So I called today to place an order for pick up tomorrow. I've been pre- ordering from them since they opened. All of a sudden they are no longer taking pre- orders because people have been doing this so they don't have to wait when they come in to eat. Seriously? I don't think I'll be ordering a dozen bagels to eat when I get there. This is so ridiculous and I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"Frustrated by Panera's \"bagels,\" decided to try this place on a whim. It's a good 20 minutes from my house so I was hoping the ride would be worth it. It wasn't.

Bagels were mediocre. Very tough and mild in flavor. What's really irritating is the 10+ minutes you will wait in line at this place. The staff works hard but makes no headway; they don't work smart and so what should be a quick morning bagel slowly--very slowly--turns into an afternoon exercise in futility. 

Very expensive. Bagels are $12/dozen and cream cheese $1.71 for a 1/4 pound. Bottles of Snapple are $2.25/each. No wonder a very clearly marked sign, \"No outside food or beverage,\" graces the front door."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Bagels!  Well worth the drive.  Hey, what's not to like about a place that opens 5:30 am  7 days a week and they've already been at it for 3 hours.  The vibe reminds me of Western Bagel in LA.  

Great bagels, great prices, efficient service!"}
{"text":"After a 20 year bagel drought in California, you can understand why I was suspicious about the random bagel shop down the street from where I'm staying here in Charlotte. It smelled so good when I walked in, that this skeptical Native New Yorker became cautiously optimistic. The lady at the counter was very nice, and also vaguely Long Islandy...another good sign. I bought one bagel, took it home, toasted it and added cream cheese. Happy dance! It was delicious! Even more important: it was firm and chewy. Thats the texture I've been dreaming of...Possibly because they have better water here than in San Diego, but there is definitely a New Yorker back there somewhere making these things. I'll tell you what, when we settle in to our new place, no matter how far away we move, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Im not generally a bagel fan. I eat them if I am with my wife andshe wants one.  I tried this place because its much closer than the other options and it sucked. You order cinnamon bagel and they spread cold bitter and sprinkle some cinnamon on top.  Who wants to eat that!  I like food, and i'll admit to being picky on likes times but that's just silly.  Service was normal nothing wrong with that or the price.  Hopefully that was a fluke.  Serving Boars Head was a smart choice in my book."}
{"text":"great as always..only place in town food is close to northern flavors...lunch go to is poppy kaiser roast beef..with horse radish provo and mustard...always perfect"}
{"text":"Best bagel I have ever had outside of NY.  Gets crowded on Saturday and Sunday morning so be prepared to be patient. Family run and excellent service.  Breakfasts are reasonable and tasty, good value, great place"}
{"text":"Not bad, flavor was decent for the bagels and cream cheeses.  I was a little surprised when I order a few bagels with cream cheese that they didn't come toasted - nor did any bagels we ordered as breakfast sandwiches.  They could have at least asked if that was what I wanted.  The staff I worked with wasn't particularly friendly or helpful however they were very quick at getting the large order together.  Worth giving it another shot."}
{"text":"They do have good bagels and sandwiches but I think it's gone to their head. Prices used to be reasonable but not anymore and the staff needs improvement. Although the main food is good, their sides are awful which is surprising since it's not rocket science to make a decent potato or macaroni salad. They also need a better set up so you don't have to wait in a single line to order and especially if you call in an order and your food is cold by the time you get to the register."}
{"text":"Love this place. 1 minute from my house. Super friendly staff. Great coffee, bagels & cinnamon buns."}
{"text":"Bagels are ok.  Service is soooooooo slow.  God forbid there are grill orders ahead of you, you have to wait till that entire order is done just to a bagel order in."}
{"text":"If you love cream cheese and bagels, you are in luck. They give you LOADS of cream cheese, which is the only way to eat a bagel. Also tried an egg and cheese on a bagel. All fantastic. Reasonable prices. Super busy (line out the door) Mother's Day morning but the line went fast and the food was delicious and ready quickly. First visit and I plan on going back often."}
{"text":"Great place! Super clean! Nice staff! Good bagels!! Reminds me of being back on Long Island!! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend to come here and wow I was blown away at how fresh and good these bagels taste my new breakfast and lunch place for sure!"}
{"text":"Generally stop here on Sundays after church.  Can be a bit messy, no one seems to sweep the floor or wipe the tables off... I know they are busy but send someone out to pick up napkins off the floor.  
With that said, the bagels are very good and I always get egg and pork roll on a bagel.  Hard to find pork roll in the south but if you grew up in NJ like I did, you understand what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Thought the bagels were not good. Family liked them but I tried the place a few times and thought they were tasteless. Would never go back. Yes, it appears I'm in the minority"}
{"text":"Wonderful place, great owners, great bagels and very consistent best bagel place in charlotte..."}
{"text":"good bagels, on par with Breuggers.  sandwiches are good too. Nice attentive staff. Friendly."}
{"text":"If you're in the area this place is really cute with delicious homemade bagels, unique flavored cream cheeses, sandwiches etc. We had eaten breakfast and came for lunch- I got the BLT and my husband got a peppered turkey sub. Quality Boars head meats and cheeses- it was huge and delicious! The potato salad is sour cream based and so yummy. Would recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned bagel & sandwich shop. The line can sometimes be long but moves fairly quickly. Nice spot to catch with friends & neighbors."}
{"text":"Yes, the best bagels around.  But, you really get nickeled and dimed.  Really, a dollar extra for tomato and lettuce on you sandwich.  Oh, and now two less bagels in a dozen if you use a credit card.  A regular no more..."}
{"text":"Stopped in recently after reading the reviews.  I was not disappointed and have been back a few times.  Bagels are very good but the best thing is the vibe and the many options and choices.  Cinnamon rolls are very good and the coffee hits the spot.  The place is clean and one can always get a good feel for a place based on how the restrooms are maintained.  Will be back as it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you appreciate the basic value or respect from one human to another. I ordered two coffees and a cannoli, clearly sending the cashier to flustertown already. I tried to keep the conversation light and respectful, but when it came to taking the cannolis off my order... she very aggressively asked \"do you want the cannoli or NOT?\", to which I replied, \"Why, have you rung it up? Sorry if it's inconveniencing you\" and then she proceeded to call ME difficult when I simply wanted to take something off my order before she ran to grab it. Not to mention she had a friends food I was with, who ordered before me, behind the counter the whole time - forgetting to give it to her. Terrible service. Bad attitudes. 1/5. Also, the chocolate rainbow cake tasted stale."}
{"text":"Very excited to try this place for the first time. All of my friends have raved about how great it is. I personally will probably never go back. Not because the bagels weren't good but because the servers  were rude, argumentative  and loud. I ordered a bagel with bacon, egg and cheese. It only had bacon and egg on it. I asked one of the servers who was delivering another customer their breakfast about the sandwich. Normally I would have gone to the counter, but they were very busy and had a line out the door. I was yelled at for asking the wrong person and then told that there was cheese on a sandwich that was obviously not there. When the original server brought out my new bagel, with cheese, I apologized for asking the wrong person about my order. She just said they were really busy and began arguing with me about the missing cheese. I told her I didn't eat it and then send my bagel back. She loudly replied, \"It had cheese on it. Two of us made it. I can go get it out of the trash. It must have melted away.\" It was uncalled for. I was certainly not being difficult or unreasonable. I just wanted what I had ordered. I left and will never return again. Poor service and the bagels are not good enough to get them to go."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm about to say this but, Poppy Seeds Bagels are FABULOUS!! They are good in every way! They Really do taste like they are from NY!! 

It's a far drive from NODA but its a good thing my sister decided to move to the middle of nowhere because otherwise I would have never been able to try these never mind even hear about this place!

You walk in and they have baked deliciousness staring right at you along with all of they're homemade Cream Cheese! A lot of different flavors from Regular to Jalapeño. They seem to get really busy just while we were there on Monday morning at around 7:30 am the line began to go out the door! Stallings is very lucky I can't wait for more Poppy Seeds to open closer to me! Please?!"}
{"text":"My dad & I came here this morning. I'd never heard of it & I'm so glad we found it! We had a raspberry pastry which tasted fresh & homeade, really good. And we got a French toast bagel w/ honey almond cream cheese. We absolutely loved it! I knew from the first bite that it has been boiled, it was soft & chewy just the way I like it. Best bagel I've had here! I def recommend it & will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagel place that's close by! Their lox bagel is way over priced, but everything is super delicious!! I would eat here way more if the lox bagel way slightly less, but paying $10-12 or whatever it was is too much for me!
They hungry breakfast option is very reasonable and delicious!"}
{"text":"I am basing this review on a combination of the food and customer service. I am a New Yorker and am obsessed with bagels! I was super excited when I found this little gem and started going there to pickup dozens of bagels on the regular. I had a situation where a sandwich I had ordered for my mother togo was not placed in the bag.  I drove all the way to her house to deliver it to her since she had just recently had her knee replaced. My sandwich was in the bag however my mom's was not. 
I shared my sandwich with her but I was trying to cheer her up with a delicious specialty and it was not there for her. I contacted the owner Joe and he told me I could either come all the way back and pick up the sandwich or he would provide me with a gift certificate.  At this point the ship had sailed and we had already eaten and the distance to my mothers house was a 25 minute drive. He assured me I could stop by anytime to pick it up and he would have it readily available. One week later I stopped by and no one knew what I was talking about and Joe did not remember the conversation. They were unwilling to provide me with a gift certificate but did whip up the sandwich my mom had ordered for me which at this point was worthless. It is currently stinking up vehicle because I had planned on running errands after I stopped there. 
I will say the bagels and spreads are delicious however the rainbow cookies not good. I would give them a 4 star but unfortunately due to the customer service I received I will not be going back and I am very disappointed. This has affected me in a negative way and I honestly was not treated like a valued customer."}
{"text":"The chocolate chip cream cheese is a triumph of epic proportions and probably should be tried by everyone alive."}
{"text":"Stood in line for 10min to have them tell me the toaster doesn't work part comes Monday it's Sat. You would think they would be intelligent enough to go next door and buy a 14$ toaster. If that's how they run a business makes you wonder how they are preparing the food items. Will never go back. Would be like going to a breakfast place called all about eggs and them saying we are out of eggs when they are right next door to a grocery store.."}
{"text":"They have great bagels. I love the Asiago bagel the best because it's covered in crusty cheese and it's soft and on the inside."}
{"text":"Decent bagels and cream cheese but the salmon on the lox sandwich smelled and tasted a little funky- asked for a little extra cream cheese and got about 3 cups of it haha. Didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Great new bagel and sandwich place! The bagels are wonderful, fresh, and not chewy! They have all kinds of schmeer options, bakery goods that are delicious, and they offer all kinds of sandwiches (also fresh chicken salad, salmon salad, and other options in addition to boars head meats)!. They also have a cooler that offers a lot of popular drinks, I like that they have healthy options rather than just soda!

Very friendly and attentive staff in addition makes this a great stop!"}
{"text":"Poppyseeds bagels is so good.there are bagels are great and so are their desserts such as cookies. I recommended the cinnamon raisin bagels and tuna fish sandwiches.it's definitely worth the drive if you're  in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great new bakery & bagel/sandwich shop! Bagels are great, service is awesome & baked goods are delicious!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I have been eating at Poppy Seed bagels for about a month now. It is right down the road from my job so it was a convenient alternative to the Independence Fast Food choices. 
Now, being a Southerner, I've never had the chance to experience \"bagels &Lox\" but decided that this place might be a good starting point. After all, they taught themselves as being an authentic NY Style Bagel shop. What I got was 100% opposite of what I was expecting. Their menu pics would have you believe that you would be enjoying a delicious bagel with cream cheese,capers and thin slices of smoked salmon. What I received was about 1 cup of cream cheese with what seemed like chopped pieces of \"salmon\" mixed in with it. Can't say it tasted like anything more than a fishy cream cheese bagel. The actual bagel wasn't anything to write home about either. I've gotten the same or better at my local grocers bakery. 
I decided not to ban them after this one failed outing and gave them a second try. I had a plain bagel with their Scallion cream cheese. It was again, 1 cup of cream cheese with a few diced pieces of the actual scallion. I, honestly, couldn't even tell that it was there. T 
The next meal was one of their sandwiches. I tried the Harmony Turkey sandwich on a plain bagel. The fact that they use Boars Head meat is a plus and honestly, made the sandwich. The bagel was tough and the wimpy shredded pieces of Iceberg lettuce were a let down. 
Needless to say, I won't be going back here for the bagels, which is sad because that's what they are supposed to be specializing in. 
The decor is cute and homely. They have a good selection of kettle chips and desserts at the counter. 
However, I'll stick to McDonald's bagels with egg,cheese and bacon for a quick on-the-go breakfast. It's actually much better."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure about other users experiences but mine have been top notch. Both the girl with the freckles and the young dark haired girl (might be owners daughter) have always been very courteous to me. More importantly my food has always been great from them which hasn't always been the case with some other employees. I frequent this place because I'm local and originally from the north and love bagels."}
{"text":"good food - a little pricey for some - but 2 words will bring me back - TAYLOR HAM!!!!!"}
{"text":"There's no Poppyseeds in Yelp for the new location in Weddington, but this review is for that location.  Food looks great, but I've been there four times and the service is just so slow, I've only been able to get food once.  Lines just don't move...   I waited in lines for 10 minutes and literally only a few people were served during that time, so I just had to leave.  

The only time I was able to get food is by choosing a completely off-hours time to visit.  Hopefully they will work the kinks out, hire some additional help and start pumping customers through.  Very frustrating, but wish them the best."}
{"text":"Love the food...   But the wait!!!  4 people in line in front of me and it took 8 minutes to get to the register to place an order!  Take a page out of the McDonalds playbook and develop your version of the \"Speedie System.\"  Two people on the register...  two on the flat top and one on the bagel/pastries...  versus the order taker being the bagel getter, the cook, etc.  Especially on weekends or busy periods.

Love this place and want to come more, but I can't afford the wait....  there's rarely a quick in and out...

Would be a 5 Star otherwise...."}
{"text":"This is by far the best bagel shop in the area. If you like great NY bagels you have to check out Poppy Seeds!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich, potato salad and desert. Riding around for work looking for a place to stop. I pulled up on Poppyseeds and wondered if it was any good. Gentleman walking out said it was the best bagel spot around. He was right. Delicious pepper turkey sandwich on authentic sesame bagel with potato salad that rivaled the best I remember.  Wish I lived closer as this would be my go-to place for lunch. Come to Huntersville please."}
{"text":"I loved the interior of this restaurant.  Excellent atmosphere.

I ordered a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on an \"everything\" bagel.  It is in the top two of my favorite restaurants for egg sandwiches.

There were only two people working there (Saturday around noon).  At around 15 minutes, it took them longer than I thought to prepare our meals.

For dessert, I ordered one of their large sugar cookies with sprinkles to split with a friend.  It was the worst part of my experience here.  Very hard and dry.  Aside from that, I have no complaints about this place and will be returning very soon."}
{"text":"Best Bagels In Charlotte Area...Bar None! Closest NY Style bagels I have ever had in this area. Even better (now defunct) than Brooklyn Water Bagel. 
Many different kinds of Boars Head (The best) cold cuts to choose from in addition to various pastries, knishes, salads and other deli items. Service can be a bit slow, but it is worth the wait. I got the feeling I was back in NY!
Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagel place that's close by! Their lox bagel is way over priced, but everything is super delicious!! I would eat here way more if the lox bagel way slightly less, but paying $10-12 or whatever it was is too much for me!
They hungry breakfast option is very reasonable and delicious!"}
{"text":"I love New York, I love bagels, I love fast service. As a northerner in the south, a good bagel can be hard to find. They nail it every time, and it's cheap too!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in to this bagel shop the aroma tells you it is the real thing. In a nut shell the only NYC type bagel place in Charlotte.
The bialys and all the bagels are the best you can get in Charlotte ditto for the crumb cake. 
On Saturday mornings the line is to the door. But there is plenty of help and everything moves quickly."}
{"text":"Wow bagels that really taste this good. I have eaten bagels for years and only thought of them as just something to hold me over until lunch. Well not anymore. Poppyseed a Bagels has  some magic happening here."}
{"text":"First time dining at this new deli / bagel restaurant.  It's recently opened here in Weddington NC ,  in the space that once was occupied by Hwy 55 burgers.  

Lots of delicious baked goods and deli salads and meats to choose from. 
I chose the tuna salad sandwich on a croissant roll - which apparently was an up charge I didn't realize. Actually everything on the sandwich was an up charge. Lettuce, tomato, cheese and the croissant roll all cost extra. The only thing that I didn't get charged for was the small container of macaroni salad & the pickle.  The Mac salad was too sweet for me but the tuna salad was delicious. 

It was a good sandwich- just never in my life have I paid extra for the ingredients that make the sandwich a sandwich! 

Pricy first time experience will definitely make me return with caution on my next visit. 
It's a nice deli with lots of tables for dining in while you eat. 

I'll give it 4 stars because the sandwich was good .... just wasn't prepared to pay  $12.00 for a sandwich with tea."}
{"text":"Yeah, welp I tried since the second of February when my incident occurred with the freckle faced blonde there assaulting my sandwich with enough pepper to close the airways of a horse and talking shit about me to all the employees while slamming the ingredients around behind the line she has struck again lol.  It's unfortunate because the owner was very nice when he contacted me and sincere however as it stands I cannot trust her to touch my food for fear of her spitefulness and her aditude.  She made it extremely uncomfortable to even step foot in there  so it's just not worth it for me.    Funny enough I contacted others on yelp with similar complaints about additude and 80% of them described this girl so I know it's not me. 

So to get what happened, I went in Sunday with my daughter, I ordered my usual 2 eggs well done, on a buttered poppyseed kaiser roll with ham my daughter got a poppyseed bagel, then I ordered a dozen bagels to take home, with 1 lb of veggie cream cheese, med coffee, and a drink from the case, it came to $33 ... the young man who took my order was very nice, you could tell he was brand spankin  new because he had a nervous air to him, my daughter and I went to sit down, he came out asking about the order again switching ingredients, on which sandwich and asking what I wanted with a side....side? I told him I've never gotten a side and that's fine I don't need one , he went back in the back when he brought my sandwich out, the eggs were scrambled, it was on a plain roll, no butter, so I looked at it and said, whoa hold on in went down the line of what was wrong with the sandwich....he said he would make me another one...I said thank you, and all the while, while I got to watch my daughter eat without me while i waited for the correct sandwich, I hear miss freckle additude oh don't let her get to you in a mocking way and flat out talking smack....now we were sitting at the booth near the swinging doors closest to the line so I can hear what's going on, when I get the sandwich back,..... good thing I knew better than to order with pepper as I stopped that after last time knowing how spiteful she is.  When the sandwich came out...the amount of butter was so much that it soaked through the roll practically deteriorating it, dripping making the entire plate transparent and when I lifted the bread to look all of it wasn't even melted yet.  I WILL NEVER EVER EVER TRUST THIS PLACE TO COOK OR PREPARE A SINGLE THING WITH THIS SPITEFUL FRECKLE FACED BLONDE WORKING THERE.... the 10 times I have been there previously other than the first I dealt with others and it was fine but god forbid something is wrong with your order and you speak up, something spiteful will occur, at this point I am afraid she will spit in the food, purposely put dirt in it etc.... I have never in my life been treated so poorly, nor have I ever encountered such a nasty vindictive individual where I was afraid she would contaminate my food... if she hasn't already.   I feel bad for others she is training teaching her spiteful way of cooking and vindictive dangerous additude in the food service industry, and I feel bad for the owner who is nice and has something wonderful going which this girl is ruining almost single handedly even from others I have confirmed  this with to make sure it wasn't just me. And I feel bad for the lack of control this establishment has over their adolescent and obviously immature employees... the blonde is rubbing off on the dark haired one....she's contagious PLEASE DO NOT CALL OR CONTACT ME ANYWHERE OTHER THAN YELP ANY PHONE CALLS WILL BE TREATED AS HARASSMENT."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by friends, so we checked it out after church. Line was long, but moved pretty fast.  Here are some tips if you do go there based on what the 4 of us ordered.  You get enough cream cheese for 2 -3 people if you all like the same flavor.( my suggestion to owners would be to lower the price of your cream cheese(+1.75 ) and give 1/2 as much!  Who needs all that cream cheese?  My bagel was cin/ raisin toasted and buttered.  The edges were burnt and there was butter dripping off the bagel.  Again, way too much butter for me and I think everything is better with butter!  The bagel was tasty, but I had two raisins in it and couldn't really taste the cinnamon.
I would ask for butter on the side next time!
The paper plates the bagels were served on were kinda flimsy and not much room to spare!  Maybe a wrapper would be better.  The bagel flopped on to the not so clean table...
Coffee was so so.
Atmosphere was nice.  
The counter for paying is a very tight space for all the workers and I did notice the owner had gloves on but was also touching the receipts in the cash register and then went back making bagels!  Big NoNo!"}
{"text":"Wow these bagels are so good. The tuna salad with everything bagel is the best thing I've gotten here, and usually I get with half a dozen bagels to go with tub cream cheese if I don't have any at home. The bagels don't last that long out - maybe a day or two - but you can freeze them and toast them later.  Yes, the cream cheese is from boars head but who cares. As long as it's yummy, it's okay with me :)"}
{"text":"Walked in, placed my order, and from there it faster than I thought it was going to be considering I ordered 3 bagels with cheese, egg and bacon/sausage. Slightly confusing for a first-timer because they take your order and you don't pay until your order is ready. I kept waiting in anticipation to pay. Felt like a total noob :)"}
{"text":"Omg toasted Asiago Bagel with a smear of cream cheese. Yum. Hard to find bagels like the one's in NYC down South. Poppyseeds Bagel is the place to visit.

Friend recommended this place and it's just wow. Soft and chewy. Fresh bagel even at 6:20 pm.

This is the place to come for bagels. Will be back to try their sweet stuff.

I must have picked the popular bagel. Two other customers walked in and ordered Asiago too.

Friendly staff. Had questions on how to store bagels so they do not get hard."}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed coffee and had not had breakfast so I stopped in.  OMG the bagels are outstanding! I had the everything bagel with butter.  What I loved most is that these bagels have seeds/toppings on BOTH sides, which Panera and Einsteins don't.  I didn't remember to tell them to toast and slice it, but it was so hot and fresh that the butter just melted and it was a party in my mouth.  Each half of the bagel was sliced into fourths which made eating it very easy.  They had a huge case of pastries that looked delicious.  I was in a hurry and didn't have time to really look at the menu but they do breakfast sandwiches too.  This place is actually pretty out of my way, like 20 minutes, but I will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"The real deal. This place is authentic NY style with high quality food and fast service. Try this place. It's frigging awesome."}
{"text":"There are three things that this native southern boy loves about NYC: Its pizza, cheesecake and bagels. This morning I found myself passing by this little NY style deli and had to  drop in for a quick bagel (after first reading the Yelp reviews, of course.)  As expected, the joint was hopping at 10:30 which was a very good sign.

The line starts in front of a clear case loaded with the bagels, which I love because it puts you very close to them which helps your ordering decision. They offer the usual varieties and I ordered two eggs on a toasted everything bagel at a great price of $2.45. You can get one egg and bagel for $1.99. They also offer a fantastic breakfast deal that I had to reread twice to make sure I was reading it correctly: $4.25 for buttered bagel, 2 eggs, juice & coffee that will beckon my return.

The counter is also loaded with mounds of housemade flavored cream cheeses that look incredible. Beverages are filled and served from behind counter. I'd prefer a self service station with fountain drinks. Coffee was good however I've gotten spoiled by the variety offered by their competitors.

Not only are the bagels authentic NYers so are the workers' accents which I enjoy as they added to my overall experience. Service was friendly and enthusiastic (just like NYC right?) Sanitation code was an impressive 99!

Comparatively speaking, I'd rate them among the Charlotte area's best. Impossible not to give them at least 4 stars which could easily grow to 5 in the future. In other words, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"You've gotta love the additional space at this roomy second location of this wildly popular little NY deli/bagel joint compared to the original location at Chestnut Ln. I also love the the fact that I can order a simple egg bagel for a buck 75 or bagel with two eggs for two fifty. The item that matters most, their bagels, were excellent.  

We were a little disappointed however that, despite their high level of quality, their spinach was not fresh. I was also not impressed with their prominently displayed Chocolate Crumble that I found to be somewhat dry.

But are either of those things gonna prevent us from returning, heck no! There are just too many good things on the menu to try,  including lunch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite by far. Love the sesame seed bagels and blueberry or pumpkin spice spread!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  As close as you'll get to eating breakfast on the Island.
My daughter lived 2 minutes away but even though she's moved, we still drive the 1/2 hour it now takes to get there.
Bagels like home, rolls (harder to find than bagels down here) rainbow cookies, black and whites etc.  Love it.  Take a few minutes to check them out but remember they get crowded, especially on the weekends.  Worth it though"}
{"text":"I really liked there food here. The selection is great and everything is super fresh. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The only problem with this place is the price.  Quite overpriced for bagels and bakery items but it might almost be worth it."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town, by a long shot, coming from a New Yorker. However, you have to check your order because the likelihood of what's in that brown bag being what you actually ordered is extraordinarily low."}
{"text":"I like the food and treats...no complaints there...they have Boar's Head cold cuts. One thing that I have trouble getting past: the place has a \"cheap\" feeling.  By that I mean charging for refills, napkins a little bigger than cocktail napkins but single-ply and MUCH. thinner (really? to save a penny or two?), the water flow in the men's room is turned down to a trickle (to save water?), the dining room is cold (have to keep my coat on--again I can't or help thinking this is to save money), there are signs prohibiting you from bringing in outside food or drink (heaven forbid if I bring in a Coke that I was already drinking), and \"no pets\" (I get this, it's just the feeling I get from all this....) When I've been there it is not crowded (usually only 1-2 people in the dining room) but they can't bring my sandwich 15 feet to my table? It seems like they are going out of their way to NOT deliver to your table. The place is always clean. Good selection of treats. Usually friendly staff."}
{"text":"Moving from NY 11 years ago, and so happy that this place opened up, and looking forward to the one near our location in Indian Trail."}
{"text":"I just moved to town, one of he first meals i had was at poppyseeds bagels, order my favorite thing, eveything bagel, scooped out double toasted with scallion cream cheese it was delicious, this place has the best you can get from a deli spot, awesome bagels, lots of baked things tons of variety and such a friendly staff, i pass by everytime im around"}
{"text":"This place is always busy...and there's always a ton of yankees. The food is good, but it's hard to screw up a bagel. The service is hit or miss. Sometimes the people working there are very friendly, today there was a female that was clearly not happy to be at work. She huffed & puffed while she took orders and gave drink refills. If an employee has an attitude that bad keep her in the back, don't put her out front to be rude to customers. 
Thankfully the little teenage girl there was so pleasant and very helpful. Hopefully more customers will have the sweet girl instead of the one with an attitude problem."}
{"text":"I never thought that I'd find a solid bagel in Indian Trail of all places, but Poppyseeds is excellent. Poppyseeds also has several types of cream cheese and pastries, all of which tastes great. My only complaint is the weak coffee, but otherwise I am a fan and have been back many times."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new spot in the area, decided to give them a try today and wasn't disappointed. The store is very clean and spacious. They offer bagels, sandwiches, pastries, donuts etc. Their service was fast and they have lots of seating space if you decide to eat there. I had an everything bagel with veggie cream cheese and it tasted good. I just wish it had some more everything on it :)"}
{"text":"I love the owners. The asaigo are worth getting a dozen. I can't say enough good about this place."}
{"text":"5 Stars. Best Bagels in town.  
Sandwiches, great desserts, pastries, breakfast, and much more."}
{"text":"Best bagels in the southeast. Bialys are great, dozens of fresh pastries. The cheese danishes are amazing."}
{"text":"Just plain and simple. Poppyseeds is still on top. They are very consistant in quality and taste. Their bagels just right, but, I am still in love with the muffins!"}
{"text":"I took my mom to lunch there before we went shopping for plants at the Kings Nursery nearby. We both had bagel sandwiches. Everything was delicious. The management and staff were friendly and helpful. The pastry display was gorgeous and we enjoyed choosing from their wide variety of juices/sodas. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Rude staff, high prices and long wait times. Not returning, will get my bagels at the supermarket."}
{"text":"I am from NY and definitely LOVE this place.  Tasty spreads of cream cheese, awesome tuna salad and my favorite is the roasted red pepper sandwich that I like on a bialy.  The owner always greets you with a big hello and is fast and efficient in taking your order to making it.  I love the diet snapple options,  fresh bakery items and macaroni salad.  I go often:)"}
{"text":"This place has delicious, fresh bagels every day. The cream cheese is smooth and plentiful. They have wonderfully flavored cream cheeses and freshly made bagel sandwiches. The staff is friendly and cheerful. 
With all this going for it, it's a shame that accuracy is so lacking. Four of my last five visits, I got home to discover they got my order wrong. The wrong type of bagel or the wrong cream cheese or not toasted, whatever you can get wrong on an order of two toasted bagels with cream cheese. Thankfully, all the bagels are fresh and yummy. I'll just have to start checking my order before I leave, but I'll keep going to Poppyseed's."}
{"text":"I was visiting my cousin from New Jersey 
I was amazed by how authentic it was they even had Taylor ham. The bagels were very good similar to what I'm used to."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try out this place after driving by it quite a few times, while craving a classic bacon egg & cheese on a bagel. 
Stopped by this afternoon before going to Teeter (never good to shop while hungry!) and am super glad I did! 
Staff was super friendly, what looked like an owner/manager was training a new employee, and was incredibly friendly. The front case is a beautiful smörgåsbord (yea, I had to look that up) of fresh Boars Head meat, house made cream cheeses, and beautiful pastries.
The wife got a ruben on rye, and I got that bacon, egg, and cheese I had been craving. Couldn't resist getting some kind of pastry so we ended up with a black & white cookie (couldn't resist, just watched that Seinfeld episode, again). Both of our sandwiches were incredible, fresh, hot, and tasted great. My wifes sandwich included a pickle spear, & pot salad.  
Prices were also great, with fresh sliced Boars head, and many options, I expected to pay more than I did. 
Everything was better than expected, and with the friendly service, this has quickly become a go-to lunch spot when in the area! 
Thanks PoppySeeds!"}
{"text":"Impulse stop because we were at the shopping center for other things. My son was starving and wanted a bagel... plain bagel with blueberry cream cheese was deemed best he'd ever had. I stole a bite, and it was damn good! Took home a bunch more bagels and some of their homemade choco-chip cream cheese. Will update review tomorrow after breakfast! Also, staff was so super nice! My son asked if we could swing by every day after school so he could get a bagel as his snack."}
{"text":"Service was adequate but lacking any smiles for the day after Christmas. I ordered a dozen varied with cream cheese and 2 lox bagels.  The owner (I assumed) had to come help the staff after the two women were making my lox bagels. The line increased behind me and the 2nd pay Station was not being utilized. I had to repeat the order to the owner for him to charge me. I was surprised when I got home and the lox everything bagels did not have red onions, tomato and capers. For $11 each, I thought it was included. For some reason they offer a side of chips or slaw. This being 8am, it seemed odd, but I guess a lot of people want the lox for lunch. 
Person exiting in front of me knew I had my hands full but didn't even offer to hold the door. That is not Management's fault, but it may describe a customers disgruntled attitude. General cheerfulness was missing and not a great experience. Bagels were fine."}
{"text":"Being from PA this is our go to stop for bagels, since they're made on site and always fresh with MANY varieties to choose from i.e. specialities like egg everything and blueberry. They have just as many options of Philadelphia cream cheese to top off. Breakfast sandwiches and omelettes as well as lunch items like hoagies and wraps with Boardshead meats. They're potato salad is amazing. There's many delicious dessert options such as pastries, donuts, tarts and more. Be prepared for a line when you walk in the door, but it usually goes pretty fast."}
{"text":"Definitely yummy food but it is very expensive for the area. A breakfast sandwich and coffee from Starbucks is a super bargain by comparison."}
{"text":"Bagels were good but they didn't toast them. They didn't ask if I wanted it toasted so I assumed they would. But still delicious! Donut was not very good, more like cake than a donut."}
{"text":"Never had a bad bit nor bad service. You have to be on your toes though and stay focused because they move fast so they can keep that line moving. If not, due to its popularity you would wait for days. NY style bagels are spot on along with their delicious creamcheeses keep the line from never ending. Their donuts are the thing dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Closest we've found to NY bagels. Egg sandwiches are delicious. Friendly place. We are here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of several locals who wouldn't buy bagels anywhere else. I was not disappointed--bagels were top-notch even at the end of the day and come in sweet and savory flavors while they last. I opted for a BLT on a croissant and a French toast bagel with honey almond cream cheese for dessert. Croissant was flaky and the sandwich was perfect for helping me not make bad decisions in the grocery store due to Hanger issues ;-) Loved the bagel and cream cheese as well, though the cafe serves beautiful Italian desserts and pastries that were certainly tempting. I'll be back for a black and white--the guy in front of me in line certainly bought enough to convince me of their deliciousness! I'll be back once I wake up from my delicious carb coma. Mmm...Zzz"}
{"text":"By far the best bagel I've had in the South. Went in on the Sunday afternoon of Thanksgiving, no line, the salesgirl was very pleasant. They were out of a few bagel types but had my mainstay: sesame. 

I picked up my week's breakfast, 1/2 dozen sesame with a half pound each of lox and scallion spread. I do like my schmear. 

I waited until dinner to try them out. Totally worth the trek out to the middle of nowhere (apologies south towners, but this is a haul from home in SouthEnd). 

I was totally surprised to see the other baked goods- I didn't buy any this time but can see some fresh coffee cake in my future. This is the real kind- 2 inch high slab of crumbs over cake. They also had rolls and lunch meat (Boar's Head!). 

And I think I spotted a full smoked salmon. If they cut that to order, I just might pass out. If they have some who knows how to, I could die. 

My bias is:  I worked in a bagel shop in high school (shout out to Strathmore Bagels in Somerstown Shopping Center!) and this place has the same feel- family owned with good food. I don't think they have the Bubbe's from the retirement community across the way to tsk-tsk whenever they don't get exactly what they want (despite what they asked for, lol) to keep everyone in their toes, though."}
{"text":"Amazing Bagels and desserts ! My favorite is the egg everything with the jalapeño cream cheese! They are almost always busy but get through the lines as fast as they can  and my order is always correct!"}
{"text":"Great spot without all of the frills.  I'm a southerner, apparently I don't know bagels.  But... my Northern friends and wife allow me some street cred.  Poppyseed is the quintessential norther, New York specifically, bagel store.  The staff are quickly taking orders, getting customers in and out quickly.

The shop is perfectly sized with a refrigerated counter of baked goods and flavored creamed cheeses with a variety of flavors of bagels staked on top.  The only downside is the condensation that builds up on the display case of the creamed cheeses that doesn't allow clear view of the flavors."}
{"text":"Honestly this is the type of bagel place that makes you shed the regret of moving down from up North, with their toll road, accents and traffic.  The parking lot is littered with other oversized SUV's still toting their NY and Jersey Plates.  I hope the police crack down on those Yankee infiltrators.  Go back to Long Island. 

My go to back in Dirty Jerz was an everything with veggie spread.  I get the same here.  And its like Space X, outta this world.

They have tons of bagels and other delicious treats, but like an addict, my only solace comes in that everything bagel and veggie spread.  I'll get pork roll one day, maybe in May, I've some some time off."}
{"text":"Great bagels with amazing flavored cream cheeses. I love the honey almond cream cheese on French Toast bagel. Husband swears by the lox spread. Good prices & friendly service!"}
{"text":"We LOVE having poppy seeds in the area and the food is awesome but.... we are hoping the service kinks get fixed ! The line moves SO slowly every time or we would be there every single day weekend!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today to try it out. I just started working in the area so have been searching for good options not fast food. 
This was Perfect! The staff was super friendly. I had a turkey bagel sandwich that came with chips - Boars Head meat is always on point and the bagel was New York Style Fresh and Delicious- my husband joined me and also got a sandwich on a sesame bagel and said it was also super fresh and good. 
Then we get to the really good part ....Desert! 
I had a brownie that took up the entire to go box and it was \"Just like Grandma Use to Make\" I could smell the chocolate the second I open the bag. Nom Nom Nom  
I can't wait to go back and try some other items."}
{"text":"The bagels are fantastic and the donuts are as well.  We were nervous when we first arrived due to the long line but the staff is VERY efficient and the line moved quickly with very little delay.   Clean, well lit and well decorated we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I am not originally from NY, but I can appreciate a good bagel...and these bagels are pretty good.  The cream cheese flavors are also very good and made with fresh ingredients.  My favorite is the Bacon, Tomato and Scallion...real bacon, fesh tomatoe and slices of green onion.  My son tried the Chocolate Chip and the flavor was a bit flat.  Not bad, but not WOW....which is what we were hoping for.  We have also tried the Green Olive and Pimento and that was good, too.  My husband likes the Cheddar and Jalapeno, chock full of sliced fresh jalapeno...seeds and all.   

I have been there for lunch a couple of times and have tried their Italian sub and Veggie wrap...both were really good!  They serve Boar's Head meats.

They also have a great selection of desserts and beverages.  The coffee is ok.  My son liked the Black & White and M&M cookies."}
{"text":"There are a few bagel places in Charlotte - and to be fair, Poppyseeds is not quite in Charlotte, but it is well worth the drive if you are anywhere near. Though they are open most of the day, you are most likely to visit in the early morning, those being prime bagel eating hours.

When you do, you will almost always find a short line awaits you. Luckily, it moves quickly, so be ready - the line moves along the cases that showcase the bagels that are available that day, and the boards overhead show you the various toppings (spreads) that are in stock.

The only downside, other than the locale, is that you have to be ready to go - drinks are available at the beginning of the line, so you have to get your drink, check out the bagels and scan the menu boards all at the same time, right up front. At first glance it also doesn't seem that they offer fountain drinks, but they are available behind the counter.

Service is outstanding - if they have a minute (a rarity), the staff is very welcoming."}
{"text":"I've never had a bagel so good in my life.  Seriously! I can't tell you what it is but these guys have unlocked the secret to the perfect bagel.  They're heavenly when they're still hot and served as a sandwich.  Prices are excellent and so this place is busy but definitely a top spot for the bagel lovers.  The best bagel in Charlotte."}
{"text":"GREAT customer service and the food was wonderful! I am picky! Eggs were cooked perfectly and the staff went out of their way to be nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"A little Long Island in Matthews! Awesome staff,  bagels and pastries. For those who complain about the price,  go over to Harris  Teeter and get a bag of Thomas'. I'll support them as long as I'm living here!"}
{"text":"True NYC bagels, multiple spreads (including whitefish), black &white cookies, eggs and great coffee. Four floor to ceiling drink refrigerators, milk, OJ, soda, etc. 

Relaxing outdoor tables and seating inside complete this storefront eatery. Lots of kids here from babies to teens; a family place. 

Most people pick-up and take away here. About what you'd expect to pay for a good bagel and have some nice Italian butter cookies for a sweet table."}
{"text":"Always fresh, always good. This is the second store for this nice family from NYC. They have one in Marthews and soon to be one in the Sun Valley area. 

Get a toasted bagel and coffee-you won't be sorry, however they have great sandwiches with Boarshead meat/cheese. Cater your next meeting, your clients will love it!

Parking lot, casual dress, $."}
{"text":"When you walk in - especially mornings - you will hear angels all singing in harmony."}
{"text":"Been going to Poppyseeds Bagels for a few months now and everything has been good in the past.  Today as I waited 15 minutes for my bagel and lox, they were extremely rude and waited on people the servers knew behind me in line before taking my order.  When I finally got my order they wouldn't take cash, they were missing the pen they mark $20 bills and refused to take my cash.  Not sure I ever been to a business that makes you wait while being rude to you and then refused to give you your order because they were not equipped to take cash.  The staff then became belligerent to me when I refused to use my credit card.  It seemed to be a good place but I will never be treated like that again by people who obviously don't want to stay in business."}
{"text":"I am meeting a friend this morning for breakfast and he recommended this place. When I first moved to the US to go to school in Syracuse I used to visit a bagel place and It was amazing. Since I moved to the south 18 years ago I haven't taste a bagel as good and neither have feel like I am up north. As a well travel person this place is an A+ for a bagel place. From the feel to the food. I will be back"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Great customer service and the menu is awesome. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service.  And open 365 days a year is great!! Food is delicious and the service is real quick! I will always be a customer of Poppyseeds Bagels!!"}
{"text":"They have good bagels but that's about it we have been there multiple times to give them another shot but there pastries always seem to be dry and there attitude never changes always rude the lady at the counter cares less it seems very rude will never go back !!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent bagels and cream cheese flavors. I wish they would brew better coffee to make the breakfast experience complete."}
{"text":"I got a grilled cheese on a croissant and it was pretty good. It's a cute little breakfast shop."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, the search for a decent bagel in CLT has been frustrating. Most bagels in this city come from chains and are soft, mushy rolls with holes. Not my idea of a bagel. Luckily, there's PoppySeeds, serving bagels that could have come from NY. The right consistency, the right texture, and the right toppings. This place puts those bagel chains to shame and deserves a try. Go, get a bagel with a shmear! You'll love it."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried from here has been amazing. I love the pastries, omelettes, and bagels! I don't think you can go wrong ordering something here. The only thing they need is some good coffee and it would be perfect. The staff isn't outstanding but they do their job. The prices are a lot lower than you'd expect for a full omelette and same with the pastries. It's a good place if you wanna get away from all the crowded chain restaurants and get some great food. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Being a southerner, you kind of just assume that a bagel is a bagel. After many years of going to their original location and now to this new one, I truly understand that a bagel isn't just a bagel. I adore everything about this place. Their cream cheeses are amazing. Fluffy, creamy made in house cream cheese in various flavors just doesn't happen in the Charlotte area! The bagels were great as well and you can't go wrong with whatever flavor you choose. But can we talk about their pastry case??? Holy cow! Massively huge brownies, all types of cookies, muffins, crumb cakes, and danishes. Love cannoli? Then this is your place! Choose your shell, and they will fill it with sweet creamy goodness. Stop in here for a bite to eat. I promise you, they do not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Bagel sandwiches were quite good, but we won't be back.  This restaurant charges to refill DINE-IN fountain drinks which is not a mainstream or competitive practice for the area."}
{"text":"We moved from NYC and made it our mission to find a real bagel in Charlotte. By far, the best bagels in Charlotte! The line can be long on the weekends, but you won't find a more authentic bagel experience in the area."}
{"text":"THESE are authentic New York bagels! The chain stores can't match this place. 

Nowadays, these bagels are better than most places on Long Island (I said 'most', not all).

I buy them by the dozen and in my house they're gone before the bag gets cold.

If you grew up getting your bagels from a package at Food Lion, you have no idea what a real bagel is until you get one of these."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We visit Charlotte a few times each year and our trip home always starts with Poppyseed bagels. Their bagels are perfect, not dry or chewy like some can get. And their cream cheeses are outrageous. I get a whole wheat everything with jalepeno cream cheese."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Charlotte! 
I am originally from NY and these are the closest to the real deal as you'll find in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The bagels are good.  The service is terrible.  Long lines & they write everything down & often don't get it right.  They need a bagels only, nothing on them, line.  Baffles me that they apparently ran places on Long Island like this with 5x the population.

I don't go as often simply due to this.  Each person in front of you takes about 5 minutes so you can figure how long you'll be there."}
{"text":"When I miss my NY style breakfast sandwich this is my go to place!  Bagels are really decent and their prices are reasonable.  Staff is very friendly and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Living in New York for 3 years, if nothing else, granted me an intimate knowledge of bageldom. Poppyseeds Bagels is the closest thing to a New York bagel in the Carolinas.

Back in my days working at a bagel shop in Durham, I remember once a customer asked me for an egg bagel. Me, being among the uninitiated, gave her a bagel with an egg on it. 

Oh, how wrong I was,  and now I have seen the light. Poppyseeds makes a number of fantastic bagel offerings -- I especially recommend the French toast bagel, which tastes like French toast... but a bagel -- but for my money, their egg bagel is king. It's like a full breakfast in one tire shaped package. 

Poppyseeds is the reason getting lost in small town North Carolina can be a blessing in disguise. It's such an unassuming place from the outside: no fancy signage, no sign twirling teenager showing you where it is. Nope, this is a local secret that only those in the know understand. 

The interior is reminiscent of those NYC delis, if they had been dipped in sunshine and southern charm. They have ail the fixings of one, too. House made cream cheese spreads, tuna, egg and chicken salads adorn one display case. Boars Head deli meat is in another. 

But make no mistake, though it's hit the soul of a New York deli, this is a bakery at heart. Next to the spreads is s display case of a-ok Manny of cookies, brownies, muffins, cakes and other pastures for your eating pleasure. 

Ok, do I think you get it. Go find this place. You'll be glad you got lost somewhere in Matthews."}
{"text":"This place really does remind me of home. From the Stewart's sodas, to the massive array of cream cheeses, and their general, awesome, yankee-ness.

My fiance and I come here often, and never have been disappointed with the food, staff, or seating. The girls are a pleasure every visit, and know how to cook some good omelets. The place is always jamming with people, but always worth the wait. 

Thank you for being here in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here. Was impressed both times. Hubby had the hungry man breakfast and I had the create your own omlette. Both meals were very good and filling. Will go back again and try some other sandwiches.

Being Sunday it was a little crowded but the line moved very quickly and service was prompt."}
{"text":"Good bagels, tuna salad WITHOUT onions...yay, Boarshead luncheon meats.  

Coffee:  get your coffee elsewhere!!!! I call it 1-bean coffee.  Hey guys, change your vendor!! You need dark roast, and coffee that has some taste (not necessarily flavors)....full body, fresh!!  Very disappointing re your coffee, currently."}
{"text":"I'm a faithful customer to poppy seed bagel store.  Its as close to a New York bagel as you will get here. Js open one closet to my house. DENISE R."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Stopped in for breakfast with my daughter. Omelette, home fries, bagel, and a cookie. All excellent"}
{"text":"I just tried, but I can't get enthused about the bagels. I've been here mid afternoon a few times and wondered if I was just unlucky enough to be given bagels more firm than I like. I made a point to come early in the morning, and I had the same issue. 

All is not lost though, I grabbed a few sweets treats and those were phenomenal. Going forward I'll return, but just for their rainbow cookies, doughnuts and brownies."}
{"text":"Hv eaten fresher bagels but hey I'm in NC. Starved, I ate half of an egg bagel from my best friend's plate since I left my two bagels in her car. U know when you're starved everything is delicious. Hahaha. Only gripe is for a couple hours smelling like the \"Everything\" Bagel after having waited in line n waiting on the side for the order. Um, a better ventilation system would help maybe? Hope they'll read this. Oh wait, I understand they just opened a few months but they had so many employees crammed in back of the counter so y was the line so slow? Keep the door open for ventilation, please. Maybe I might stop by again someday(?)."}
