{"text":"Kin Khao 25 had a pretty good taste but the price kind of threw me off guard. The ambiance and the decor of the restaurant is kind of in the plain side. We purchased a groupon coupon to come to this restaurant.   Appetizer  The calamari plate was tender but a bit oily. The sausage were good.  Main meal  The curry had a good taste but I felt like the portion of protein was missing. As for the grilled meats plate, the best part was the shrimp. For the grilled beef and chicken, I have tasted better elsewhere. If you like sticky rice, substitute the regular rice for that one!  The groupon coupon was a good purchase but this would be my last time there."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I had a tom yum soup ($6), a beef salad ($10) and green curry chicken ($14). The soup was quite good with a nice balance of flavors, sour and a bit spicy. It had a few shrimps and mushrooms and the thai basil was fragrant. The beef in the salad was cooked well, juicy and tasty. And the seasonings in the salad were distinct. The green curry was fine, maybe not the best but respectable. I did like that it wasn't too sweet or salty like some I've had in the past. The thai basil wasn't quite as strong in the green curry as I would've liked. If you're wondering, yes, thai basil is probably my favorite flavor ever.  Portion to price ratio is decent but $3 for a bowl of rice is ridiculous. A main dish alone will likely not make you full by itself but I think the quality of ingredients and cooking merit the price. I definitely intend on coming back and I would make sure to try some of the dishes that are more closely linked to Laos or Cambodia as I inadvertently chose ones that are maybe more linked to Thailand. It's not a particularly big place but not small either and it has several six person tables."}
{"text":"We had some good food and friendly services here. We highly recommend this place for Lao food lovers."}
{"text":"Authentic lao food. It's my go-to when my mommy is too far for me. I always get take out there across the street. Satisfied everytime."}
{"text":"Vraiment une très bonne surprise !   Je me suis rendue à Kin Khao 25 avec une amie Franco-laotienne après avoir réservé un repas 4 services sur Groupon ($45 au lieu de $92).   La nourriture est VRAIMENT authentique ! Certains plats sont même difficiles d'accès pour certains \"occidentaux\" qui n'aiment pas la sauce poisson ou la viande fermentée.   Le menu Groupon est composé d'une soupe, une entrée, un plat et un dessert (bananes frites). Les quantités sont correctes et on sort de ce restaurant en ayant l'impression d'avoir voyagé et découvert de nouvelles saveurs.   De mon côté, petit coup de coeur pour le Nam Khao (salade de riz croustillant avec saucisse fermentée). Mon amie a commandé une salade de papaye (en demandant la version laotienne et non thaïlandaise) et a été conquise.  Côté service, rien à redire. Serveuse souriante, sympathique et à l'écoute qui nous a expliqué la totalité du menu et qui n'a pas bronché lorsque j'ai mentionné que je ne voulais pas de basilic thaï dans mes plats (ce qui n'est pas chose facile sachant qu'ils en mettent littéralement partout).   Je recommande vivement !"}
