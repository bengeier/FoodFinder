{"text":"Warning!!! Safety and health issue!! After ordering a regular Chicken Philly Steak and a small Chicken Philly and fries at the cashier. We watched the chicken and veggies being grilled by the cook and then suddenly saw him took out a chunk of white plastic from the chicken and veggies. He was showing it to his colleagues and telling them about it. He knew I saw what he did & and I thought he will throw the chicken and veggies away, but for some reason he did not throw away the contaminated chicken and veggies and continued cooking it. At this point I was watching closely and made sure that he will not serve that to us. However, he did try to serve it to us and  I told him that I will not take it, because it was cooked with plastic. I asked him to cook me a new one. I can not believe that he has the audacity to serve it. Especially,  he knew that I saw what happened. He did not apologize and said anything about it.   I asked for the manager but he was not available and I was informed that the cook was the supervisor in charge at that time. Since, he was busy cooking he sent another team leader Arlyn and told me that she is also acting as a supervisor. So, I told her what happened and I want the manager to know about it,  because it was a health and safety issue. It was something serious that it needs to be addressed. She got my cell phone number,  so the manager will call me after 1 hour.  Gave them 3 hours to call me before writing this review to give them a chance, but I think the cook/supervisor and Arlyn team leader either forgot or didn't tell the manager about it. So,  I just want to warn people to watch the cook while grilling your food. He doesn't know the health and food safety regulations. Cooking your food with plastic is not a healthy and safe!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place on the East Coast.  I live 6-7 hours away but make it a point to come once or twice when I'm in the city.  The food is high quality.  I almost went 2 days in a row, but it was a weekend, and there were too many kids.  What I'd really like to see is someone open a nice, classy franchise in in Henderson or Summerlin instead of in a scuzzy mall."}
{"text":"$5 large subs on Tuesdays!! My fav is the buffalo sub with lots of ranch.. goodness!"}
{"text":"Food: I would suggest working your way around the menu because you might find something you like possibly better than the Philly (buffalo chicken). The Philly is great though.  Staff: I have visited on several occasions and 95% of them are after 8pm and the staff is just alive like they haven't worked all day! The manager Kayli is always super nice and greets me with a smile and a \"Welcome to Charleys\"! The line workers are my #squadgoals. I almost have all of their names memorized (Micaela, Josh, Keshawn, Jessica and LJ (looks like Jimmy Butler). These guys make me want to come back! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Food was great. How ever when I walked up to the counter the person behind it just stared at me. So I just stared back until she was forced to ask me what I wanted. They forgot to give me my fries as well. Not the greatest experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! Best philly in town! Every time I go to the mall I have to stop. Now I only wish they would open one outside of the mall in the northwest! Yummmmm"}
{"text":"Disgusting service. Employee was absolutely disrespectful, spoke Spanish and when as find her to speak English she acted like we're stupid. She took at least 5 minutes to put our order in, on top of that we had to correct her multiple times. The employee didn't make the items on the menu clear and messed up our order. When she did that and we asked the chef, he was just as disrespectful as her. Terrible service. Don't recommend, eat Charleys Philly steaks at chandler mall."}
{"text":"Cruising for the mall and wanted a bite to eat. I never heard of Charleys, so I thought I'd give it a try. Service was okay. Person that the register was eager to have us try a free sample. I thought all cheesesteaks were created equal, I was sadly mistaken. This was nothing to write home about. Large cup of ice, little cup of fries, and the cost for two meal was almost $20. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"We ordered for lunch. Great cheese steak sandwich at decent price. Large selection of other food."}
{"text":"This place makes great food.  It's delicious.  I usually get the Philly Cheese Steak with fries. They do a good job making  their fries.  They also give you a card so after you buy a certain amount you get a free sub. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the prices but took off 1 star because we forgot to show our movie tickets for discount, and when we did get back in line to show our movie tickets...they said \"it's too late\". Most businesses would remedy that anyway but not them. It's still a great place to eat and the kids love their chicken tenders!!"}
{"text":"A complete ripoff. Got a steak and cheese.Paid extra for more mushrooms and got 1 sliver and a half of a mushroom, two slivers of a pepper, and a few slivers of onions. Peppers and mushrooms  were razor thin. When I saw how stingy they were with the vegetables I asked them politely if they could put extra.With the look of disgust,they replied 50 Cent,50cent.For a second I thought the rapper 50 Cent had walked into the food court, but then realized they were just trying to get $.50 more out of me for something I had already paid for. I then told him I had already paid extra and he replied,that's the recipe I can't change it! That's when I looked at him with the same disgusted face that he gave me, and said quite loudly, you are ripping me off, and I want my money back.It was only then, in embarrassment, that he added a slightly bit more of the vegetables that I had already paid for. Is this what it takes to get good service these days?  These so called restaurants are going to need to step up their game and get back to quality and value if they want to get a good review from me or anyone else. Needless to say, I will not be going back to Charlie's Philly steak!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It is such a convenient location for walking around the mall. Easy enough to get to even if you just want a sandwich. I always get the buffalo chicken sandwich. Cooked fast and right in front of you. The french fries are also cooked well and put in the oil right after they are ordered. I have never had a bad meal from there. The sandwiches are priced reasonably for the amount of food that you get!"}
{"text":"Nice sandwiches, me and my husband always get one regular Philly Cheese Steak to share. Also, they make nice French fries with bacon and cheese. I have to say their Philly cheese steak taste nothing like the real Philly cheese steak it is different but very good!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have not had a bad experience. Their food tastes great although I will mention they are light-handed on the veggies. You will generally only get a few on the cheesesteak sandwich. I have never ordered anything else except cheesesteaks and fries (after all it is Charlie's Philly Steaks). They taste great and the food is cooked right in front of you. The fries are perfectly crispy. I will continue to come back"}
{"text":"Had the buffalo cheesesteak and it was DELICIOUS. I also tried the bacon fries. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! The customer service is always good. They are always very clear when they talk and excited to make the sandwich that you ask for. I have gone here like 4 times in the last two weeks and love it and will continue to come here. So thank you Charlie's!"}
{"text":"What a monumental waste of money.  Forefathers is the only place to go for cheese steaks."}
{"text":"Great tasting Philly Steak Sandwich...good portions, great cheese flavor...not a single negative thing to say about this experience!"}
{"text":"Came in today for the first time and ordered to Philly cheesesteaks and fries and drink. The bread was made flesh the order his sandwich was really tasty and the fries were really good. The person that took our order was very friendly and helpful for a mall The Establishment was clean and this is at a food court we will return"}
{"text":"OMG, what kind of stale hell is this? It's possible that, as someone who grew up within a stone's throw of Philly, my expectations are unreasonably high, but this is absolute dog food.  Philly steaks are RIBEYE - ribeye, people.  Charleys is more like Alpo.  And an Amoroso roll, this is not.  Seriously, I didn't even finish half of this garbage sandwich.  Just bad, plain bad.  Like even the bleh chain Corlione's has a 100x better rendition of a cheesesteak.  If you can't make it to the east coast for a Tony Luke (or an Ishkabibble if you're on South), at least go for a DeFalco's in Scottsdale.  Or just open a can of dog food since it's pretty much the same thing and doesn't cost 8 bucks."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat Charley's religiously. this used to be our favorite location since there aren't many in our area but last time we went (about a month ago) the usually chefs had been replaced. We ordered the usual and sat down to wait for our sand which. Usually, the sand which is ready within a couple minutes and fresh. This time we had waited over 20 minutes for our sand which. My husband came up to me and said: \"it looks like our sand which is almost done but our fries have been sitting there the whole time. I'm gonna ask them for fresh fries.\" When he asked for fresh fries the \"head chef\" who was maybe in his early twenty responded rudely without making contact: \"I took the fries out when they were ready.\" they ended up arguing with us that they had a policy which states they have to serve the fries once their done but that should also mean my sandwich should be done when my fries are. Instead of me waiting twenty minutes for my sandwich after I got my fries."}
{"text":"The food was really disappointing and not good at all. Extremely salty and barely any meat on the sandwich. I ended up throwing it away. The two younger girls working were really nice, but the chef that was cooking was giving me attitude and was simply rude. I asked for the mushrooms to be added to my sandwich since I had ordered it that way, I even told him he didn't have to cook them. He threw them on, pushed my sandwich forward and went on his way."}
{"text":"Oh my god I loved  my jalapeño steak sandwich!!! The meat was really soft and tasty . Cheesy, juicy and fresh . I would definitely recommend this places . They gave me great customer service too. Love this place !"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Charley's a few times. It's pretty good, but it's WAY over priced. Recently I walked by the store and considered eating there, but then saw the cashier standing there on his cell phone doing nothing. Can't stand that. I've worked in retail/customer service/food service in the past and that is one thing I won't tolerate."}
{"text":"Solid food court option. Downside is that they can't package to go, but their pricing is surprisingly reasonable for the captive audience inside of a mall. Their $5 deal for a small chicken philly and fries is an ample portion of food, but you'll probably want to upgrade to their gourmet fries.  Staff is quick and efficient, outside of a food court the quality of food would be considered mediocre but it's a better choice than smoothies and Panda Express."}
{"text":"Good lord this food is delicious. Never heard of this place before moving here from Indiana. My buddy said you gotta try this sandwich place. Found out it was a chain. Got skeptical. Had a buffalo chicken sub. Speechless. I would eat this every day if I could. If money weren't a thing and if carbs didn't make you gain weight, I would pound 3 of these a day they are so freaking good. A must for sandwich lovers."}
{"text":"The sandwich was good and the fries were as well. It was nothing above average, but definitely one of the better choices in the food court. However, I did ask for their nutrition informations and they were unable to provide any."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Great atmosphere!! Food is Amazing a little pricey. But you do at least get what you pay for as for fast food wise. The employees that work at this location are amazing as compared to a few other locations that I have been to. The speed of service & friendly atmosphere are amazing especially since they have a smaller then normal work space compared to other Charleys locations."}
{"text":"Melissa and Auphan are the sweetest! They absolutely excel in customer service. If they're not there or the younger gentleman isn't there, I honestly look else where to eat lunch. Thank You guys for a great experience, delicious food, and the best Strawberry Lemonade ever!"}
{"text":"A lot of people told me to try this place out the manager Stephen is a jerk they messed up my order with my receipt still being in the restaurant he did not want to fix it he told me they always get tooken this guy does not be long to be a manager he does not fix his mistakes and they had a big nasty water bug crawling around in the restaurant and they said they always get that so it's kind of ridiculous"}
{"text":"For how expensive this meal was ($8 and change) I was really disappointed by how little was given. I got the veggie delight and to my dismay, they didn't use much veggies. My sandwich was mostly bread. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice to see the new remodeling and the new menu help is now in chef coats food is five star love their signature lemonades strawberry peach or blueberry can't forget to mention the cheesy bacon fries fast service"}
{"text":"Wow this place is good. Only complaint is it will ruin your calorie count for the week. But for a splurge it is hard to beat. Great cheesesteaks, chicken cheesesteaks and the fries are insane. Fries offered regular  or + cheese + bacon + ranch!"}
{"text":"I'm all done. 2 outta 3 tries was very bad. Tosay was most recent. Months after opening. Meat is completely dried out and chewy. Gross. Not getting more of my dollars."}
{"text":"This is based on service alone. My better half went to get me a cheese steak. She had asked them NOT to put lettuce and tomato on it. When the sub is finished, guess what? Lettuce and tomato on it! She had them remake it. And guess what? Lettuce and tomato on it. The server was very rude even though she was the one making the mistakes. The Charley's at the Superstition Springs mall is WAY better than this location."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Both the steak and the chicken are very good. Also recommended their fries with either malt vinegar or cheese on the side."}
{"text":"So we have gotten sandwiches and fries here before and was good. Today I stopped in with my 2 girls to get strawberry lemonade, which is good. One of my girls wanted a salad and we saw on the menu garden salad. When I think of a garden salad I think of lettuce, at least 3 vegetables and salad dressing. What we got was a big bowl of lettuce and 3 slices of tomato. I said \"um what's this? Is this just lettuce and 3 small slices of tomatoes\" and the gentlemen said \"yes\". I said \"you don't have olives or mushrooms or onions or carrots\". He said \"it just comes with tomatoes but I can give you some carrots\" like he was doing me a favor. Paid 4.99 for lettuce and 3 tiny tomato slices. You know they at least have mushrooms and onions for the subs but would not give me any! Worst service!"}
{"text":"Awesome Philly cheese steak sandwich! We would definitely come back! Staff was friendly very clean and tasted great."}
{"text":"Use to be very good service fast and professional. Over heard the new manager state \"I swear to f&@$ god these people are deaf\", it's a mall buddy there constant noise. Prior to that I was waiting in a line of zero people to take my order for 15 minutes no acknowledgement from any of the 5 employees. Went to the Panda Express across from them I'm 10 minutes had my food paid for with an egg roll. They need there old manager back at Charlie's! This guys in professional and fake."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as a Philly Cheese from Philly, but pretty darn good. Good enough that I plan on coming at least once a week. They also have chicken and veggie phillys, salads and fresh lemonade."}
{"text":"My favorite location! I have been coming here for about 10 years. I used to get their original philly but now my husband and I get the California chicken and it is to die for. I haven't had anything like it. I also like how I see the same gentlemen each time we go."}
{"text":"Really good phillies, especially for a quick lunch before work. Food was fresh and delicious and staff is very prompt and efficient. Would recommend to anyone who wants a good philly :)"}
{"text":"Great looking interior design, but the steak tastes like lamb. It's not bad, but the texture was definitely not what I was expecting"}
{"text":"The food is good, Id definitely recommend this place to anybody,I would say it's better than Great Steak that use to be there. Only reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars Is because the customer service sucks.The lack of communication between 3 to 4 workers in such a small area could be better"}
{"text":"I like the BBQ cheddar steak sandwich here! Even the small size is more than big enough for a meal and the food is always served quick and fresh only a few minutes after you order it. This is the first Charley's location I had been to and I've been to several others since then because I had such a good experience here.   Also I really love their cheese fries. Haven't tried the ultimate ones but the fries have always been fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is the only place I will probably get a hot sub sandwhich from. My favorite is the Italian deluxe. The French fries are really good as well. Just found out if you ask for ranch on the side at the register you need to pay for it. But if you ask at the end of the line when you put your toppings on it's free."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Charley's. Not only do they take all my coupons but they always give out free samples and they always make the food correctly and delicious. I don't know their names but the guys who are twins are both very cool. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Nothing like the Charley's in the mall very bad quality of food service was so slow it took forever to get our food"}
{"text":"Love the Philly Cheesesteaks here.  I have had everything on their menu. A bit pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Absolute great addition to the Food Court, which we'll be visiting again real soon!  When UR in Philly, the selling point for Geno's, Pat's or who ever, is the quality of the meat they use. In the 80's etc, along came those quick Mall places that sold process meat cubes. You remember them; so I won't name, names.   Here at Charley's, you can actually see the marbling, which is what gives their sandwiches their flavor. The fat melts and the flavor is left in the meat.   Yesterday I ordered their 9\" Sub, Hero or Hoagy (depending where UR from) for $7.79. I added extra meat for $1.80 and a small drink for about $10 in change. It was really very good and close to the real Philly experience and food coma time for me.  Charley's Philadelphia Subs is a Four and 1/2 Star experience. My only question to myself is, why didn't I give them Five Stars? Why indeed!  But   As I said in my Tip: 'I came here at 11:30 and there was only three customers in front of me. Now, twenty minutes later they're packed!  You could hear crickets at Five Guys and Subways next door.'  Woo-Hoo this is pretty close for me and Yes, I am a Fan.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decent price for a cheese steak that is mediocre. Nothing beats back east cheese steaks.  I got mine to to. When I got home and opened the sub that was wrapped, the sub was completely upside down. The cheese melted to the paper and it was bun up!! It was a complete mess but a delicious mess.  Teach your employees how to wrap a sub properly"}
{"text":"I ordered an $11 steak sandwich. They gave it to me in a bag. When I got my sub all the meat was out of the sandwich in the corner of the bag."}
{"text":"Food was good but kinda expensive. I did like how the veggies seemed fresh. Peach lemonade did not taste like a peach (it just had some pieces of peach?) The lady making my food was super friendly and nice. The guy @ the cashier seemed so 'lost', asked us what we wanted & we told him so that later he can say \"sorry I didn't hear what did you order?\". Would I go there again?  Maybe."}
{"text":"This is by farthest the best Charley's I have ever been to. Not just because of the amazing food they make, it's also the outstanding service Charley's has. The servers are very sweet, and social. They make you feel welcomed, and amazing service beats every other restaurants that doesn't have great service. This is the reason I drive so far, not only for the food but the service is never disappointing."}
{"text":"Eh not that filling. They don't put enough in their sandwiches to me. Their cheese fries were pretty good but not crispy at all."}
{"text":"The picture of a stacked cheesesteak sandwich on the wall is a bait and switch. When i got my sandwich the amount of meat was a joke. I complained to deaf ears. This was my last trip to Charleys. Go to Luke's of Chicago, get the combo. Its worth the money and delicious"}
{"text":"I love me a good cheese steak even though I never had the real deal as I never been to Philadelphia. I seen people at work eating Charleys and they said it was a cheese steak and that it was pretty good. Well one day while out running around I decided to hit Charleys up.  After dropping about $20 for three people we got our sandwiches. I liked the fact that they had unlimited lemonade. Fries were pretty decent especially if you paid extra to add bacon and cheese on them.  My cheesesteak sandwich was okay but definitely not worth visiting again. My wife had the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich and she enjoyed it but again nothing to write home about. We tried it and now that is off the bucket list. Customer service was fast and the employees were nice. Clean restaurant. Give them a try you might like it."}
{"text":"Hopefully the charleys I knew and grew up with. Just worked out so I welcomed the protein. Derek and his partner on the line were helpful and friendly. And the food being made in front of you is nice to see.. No surprises. Loved it: smelled and tasted great!"}
{"text":"The past few times I have gone it seems to be getting worse. This last visit was in fact the last and I never even got waited on. Only 2 people ahead of me but the staff of 3 was so confused they kept telling me they would be right with me but kept running back and forth in the tiny area like caged tigers. Then to top it off the end chef just kept screaming \"Manny\" at the top her lungs. Listen woman...he probably got tired of waiting and went to hot dog on a stick like me. They have turkey dogs now!"}
{"text":"I had the regular 9 inch chicken cheese steak. The chicken was very thin with greenpeppers and onions and melted cheese on top in a roll. I paid a little under $10 for a small drink and a sandwich. I couldn't even finish half of my sandwich since I thought it tasted awful. I also threw away the frequent customer card I received for my first visit. Needless to say, there will not be an encore."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I HATE food courts.  The people, the germs, the lack of seating, the lack of options, the noise.  Oy - I could go on and on.  But I needed lunch after some serious post-Christmas shopping.  And I gotta say - the food court at the Meadows Mall aint too shabby.   I went with Charley's mainly cause they're at the end of the court so there was plenty of seating around there and there was no line.  My expectations were low but I was surprised at the quality, freshness and taste of my lunch.  Playing it safe, I went with a small regular philly sub.  I omitted the lettuce, tomato and pickles (I've never heard of a philly with all that on it - is that weird or is it just me?).  I also had them hold the mushrooms cause, yeah - I don't eat fungus.   All the food is made to order and it tastes that way.  The sandwich itself was on a soft bun that was lightly toasted and the meat and veggies were cooked right in front of me - extra points for transparency.  They give you a generous amount of meat, veggies and cheese and although I got a small, I couldn't finish the entire thing myself.  Cue the hubby for leftover patrol.  We also got the gourmet fries which are essentially fries with cheese sauce, bacon bits and ranch on them.  Do yourself a favor and just get plain fries.  They stand up by themselves and you don't need all that extra junk on them.   The menu offers all sorts of philly options but being the simple gal that I am, I thoroughly enjoyed the traditional philly.  We paid a little over $20 for my small philly, hubby's medium philly, a shared gourmet fries and 2 drinks.  It's not dollar menu pricing but it's worth it.  If you've worked up an appetite at the Meadows Mall, give Charley's a whirl."}
{"text":"had their famous pepperoni pizza fries and chicken california...omg it was yummy, definitely worth the price"}
{"text":"got hungry shopping and the smell of fried meat coming out of this place surely got my attention.   who doesn't love a goood philly cheese steak! yum! yum!   ordered a standard classic philly cheese steak to try! saw them take out thin slices of meat and placed it on the grill....ummmmm, topped with onions and american white cheese...watching everything cook and the cheese melt....priceless!   the filling was placed on an open sub sandwich bread and served open-faced to let you drool and savour the visuals of what you are about to enjoy! and just before serving it to you, they ask for your choices of vegs...lettuce, tomato, peppers etc. just like subway!   one bite, and you know you've hit pay dirt! the meat was tender & seasoned well with basic s/p. the fried onions and cheese made the dish a winner.  my only complaint, the meat was not enough. they could certainly add more for the price being paid for. customer service was great. servers and cooks were smiling...,food came quick, hot and fresh! nothing pre-made!  happy eating! cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place with a friend of mine a couple of times a year for about 4 or 5 years. The staff is always friendly and helpful and the food is awesome. I love the grilled sub roll. It's always crisp, soft and chewy - all at the same time.  When bread was first conceived, I believe that this was the Holy Grail of breads and Charley's has found it.   I usually get some variant of the Philly Steak and have never been disappointed. My friend always gets the Buffalo Chicken and I think he's the real fan of this place. It's at his insistence that we come here. Even so, I'm always pleased and a bit let down that I didn't think of it.  I noticed last week that they have a sign posted in the window that says they give a 10% discount for patrons of the AMC Theater next door. All you have to do is show your ticket stub. Nice to know.  I also noticed that this particular store has online ordering. Just go to http://www.charleys.com/ and put in the zip (85027) and click on the \"order online\" button. Now that I know this I may have to take advantage of that and end up eating here more often."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive considering what I paid for. First, the blonde at the register called the employee on the grill an asshole. Not sure if that's company policy? The sandwich I ordered was the pepperoni steak, and I'm still trying to find the meat! It was all bun. Second, the fries were under cooked, and needed plenty of salt because they were that boring. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"This location in the meadows mall is not a great representation of the brand at all. I've had it a lot better in other states for sure. I really amped this place up for my partner and it was a huge womping fail.  My favorite is the chicken cheese steak. This was the worst cheese steak in general I've ever had. There was only one person working the register and cooking.......  And only one order ahead of mine....  My two cheese steaks were done 10 minutes before my fries....how?!  My cheese was not melted at all. My bun was not warm at all. The peppers were cold, it's like they were thrown on there cold and not cooked on the grill...  Just overall a confusing and bad experience. Shoulda saved my $22 and went else where in the food court. That's $22 without a drink by the way."}
{"text":"Terrible would never return, had me waiting 40 mins for my food and got it wrong also they charged me more then the advertised price. Then when I get home I found a freaking hair in my sandwich so disgusting. Would never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"In no way, shape or form is this anything close to a Cheesesteak!!  Utterly disgusting and a waste of money.  Two bites into my sandwich and that was all I got down.  Going next door to The Fired Pie."}
{"text":"I don't understand why there's so few 5 star reviews when no one has anything bad to say! Armando is always nice and welcoming, the rest of the staff is efficient, my food is always delicious. And $5.99 for a fresh cooked meal is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Place is outstanding for being in the mall in such an upscale location.  Theres a reason why they are more expensive then the subway next door.  Ill go to subway if i ever need food for my rabbit"}
{"text":"For a fast-food Philly, it's decent. They have a lot of choices, and also have loaded fries with cheese, bacon, etc. on top.  The Philly Steak and Bleu is good, with real bleu cheese crumbles added to your steak while it is on the grill, making a tasty goo on top of your sandwich."}
{"text":"Something told me to set my expectations low, but my Charley's Philly cheesesteak left me pleasantly surprised. The steak was quite nicely seasoned and rich with plenty of provolone (which purists are sure to argue is NOT a Philly cheesesteak... but that's another post!). Onions, green peppers, and mushrooms add to the taste. I further added lettuce, tomato, and pickles. I think I'd go back, which says a lot!"}
{"text":"Say what?!?!?! Great Steak & Fry (great steak & potato company to some) is gone??? As I walk in the food court of the Meadows Mall, I am sad to see all the changes. That is what happens with time, but I don't like change much and only seeing 2 of the same places (chains of course) still there is just a shame. There used to be more locally owned family businesses in the food court.   Hubby was off to eat at Johnny Rocket's so I decided to give this new cheesesteak (cashier says they have been open a few months) place that took the spot of GS&F out. I ordered the \"Philly Cheesesteak\" priced at $6.79 and $3.99 to add cheese fries and a drink. The cheesesteak had on it steak, grilled onions, bell peppers, mushrooms and american cheese. They have a variety if fresh toppings, so I decided to go all out west coast on this cheesesteak! I had lettuce (ended up removing most of it), tomato and mayo added. The only thing missing was some fresh avocado! I enjoyed the cheesesteak. The cheese fries were actually good, but the total price being around $12 seems steep when I can get a bigger cheesesteak and fries for a little less just down the street at Pop's. I liked the food, but wouldn't eat here again unless I had a coupon and I would have to already be shopping at the mall. The cashier mentioned signing up for the e-club to get coupons and deals.  The employees were friendly and even gave me a free refill of cherry pepsi."}
{"text":"Philadelphia should sue this place and make them remove 'Philly' from the name. Bland, tasteless, small portions; real cheese is extra. It was so bad that I reinstalled my Yelp app. I've eaten at Charley's elsewhere and not been horrified, but this particular restaurant took an already questionable iteration of a classic sandwich and drove it straight into a truck stop toilet."}
{"text":"I ordered the kids meal since I really wanted the chicken fingers. I asked and I was told they didn't come as an adult sized menu item. I also paid an extra dollar to upgrade my fries to cheesy bacon fries. The kids meal came with chicken strips, fries, 2 packaged Oreo cookies, and a small soda. While I was waiting for my food, an employee was giving out samples for a sandwich so I tried it. The sandwich was pretty good.   My meal came with 3 smaller chicken strips. The chicken was pretty good. The chicken was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The fries were ok but the cheese and the bacon that I paid extra for ruined them. Don't order the upgraded fries. The cheese is a nacho cheese that is on the watered-down side and the bacon is processed bacon bits. Gross.   I don't know if I would come back here again. Maybe. Maybe not. We'll see."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's just okay. Depends on who is working is when your order will not be quite correct. And no, I did not pay attention to the person who would mess up the orders."}
{"text":"I was in this store on 6/17 @5:00pm.  The food was great and all the employees were great , except Kimberly.  She needs to control her emotions when speaking to other employees.  With multiple patrons in the store she had a look of discus and gritting her teeth while speaking with one of EP.  She was trying to tell the other  employee something, not looking at them, loud noises going on, I am guessing the other EP could not hear  or understand what she was trying to say.  Then the other employees all had looks on their face of fear.  This is not a good environment for your patrons to view, made me wonder if I wanted to return in future.  4 stars is for the other employee and for great food. Do not include Kimberly in on this part."}
{"text":"Aweful dried out over cooked poor quality meat with low quality processed cheese on a dirty grill with no oil even used during the perpetration of the meat. Better off skipping lunch or eating at one of the other  Restraunts  at the mail. If you must have a cheese steak go to corleones it's closer to pats steaks in phili"}
{"text":"Really looked forward to this visit.  After staring at the menu board I realized that a regular sized sub combo meal was $ 11.   This is crazy.  The sub was average at best.  The place is average at best and we will never be back.  3 chicken fingers is 6.99.  Lol"}
{"text":"Just ordered a cheese steak to go. It's 80 degrees so I ordered 'light mayo'. Get to my destination and my sloppy warm sandwich is soaked in mayo. My expensive azz sandwich is ruined. If the parking wasn't so crazy around this mall I would go back for my refund. You won't get me again though! They got three stars because the cashiers were nice."}
{"text":"Was hesitant to grab a sandwich from a mall.  I eat subway daily, but this place blows them out of the water!!!  Fries taste freshly cut cooked with clean oil,  the bun is soft with a little bit of crunch, cant wait to try the many sandwiches they offer...great job!!"}
{"text":"My 7 year old son is addicted to the chicken cheese steaks.  Good fries. And he is a difficult eater. Friendly place to boot."}
{"text":"I thought that the service was friendly. It takes a minute to get your order because they cook to order which is a good thing. You see the preparing your philly steak or chicken in front of you. They take your name with your order so they can call you when its done but people still stand in line making hard for someone else to pkace an order once its crowded. This Charley's is in the food court at fashion square mall. When i received my order itvwas hit and seasoned well i had everything on it ..onion, green pepper,  lettuce and tomatoes minus the mushrooms."}
{"text":"Located in the food court of the Meadows Mall on the upper level.   This experience was kind of a disappointment! Having eaten at other Charley's Philly Steaks before, I had high hopes that this location would be as good as previous locations I had been to before. Came during lunch hour and since I didn't have a lot of time to wait for food, I decided to come here as there was only one other person in line ahead of me.   After looking at the menu, I decided on getting my go-to sandwich the Veggie Delight. Made of grilled mushrooms, onions, green bell peppers, Provolone, Swiss & White American cheeses, lettuce and tomatoes. All put on toasted sub bread. Usually this is so good, but this time, they were very skimpy on the all the veggies. To me this was very disappointing as I don't like paying for something and expecting it to be a certain way and it's nothing like what you want. The bread also wasn't very toasted, so it got soggy quickly and was falling apart before I was able to finish it. Taste wise, it was delicious..just wasn't much to it. My small sub cost $5.29.  My guest got the Bacon 3 cheese steak sub, which is made of steak, bacon, Provolone, Swiss & White American Cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, but they asked for no tomatoes. They said it tasted good, but again they didn't put much into the sub. Was very skimpy compared to other location. Cost $7.89 for a medium. On top of that, we also shared a Cheese & Bacon gourmet fries. Which is fries topped with Cheddar cheese sauce and bacon. They only offer one size, so what we got wasn't much. Cheese tasted ok, bacon not crispy and the fries were soggy. A big disappointment since they cost $3.49!   Other then the food, the staff were friendly and they got our food out quickly. They just need to get educated on how to cook and prepare the food better. Fill the subs with more items and consistently the same every time and make sure your fries are crispy."}
{"text":"I always order a buffalo chicken philly, I know it's not the traditional philly steak but it is my favorite! It kind of reminds me of subway where you can add your own toppings there's isn't as many. They have lettuce, tomato, banana peppers, jalapeños, mayo and pickles as options to add. I get lettuce, jalapeños and pickles.  The meat you choose is cooked right in front of you so it's very hot same with their French fries. For the fries they have all seasoning you can add on them yourself, I highly recommend that because I don't think they put salt on there fries so the all seasoning doesn't over do it. I usually get there lemonade as well but it is very sweet so get it if you go to the mall to eat first so you can carry it around with you, otherwise just get a fountain drink.  This place is probably your best option to eat in the mall but I would't just go eat there if I wasn't at the mall lol that's why I gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Pros- Food is served hot and Fresh They have Diet Dr. Pepper Staff is above standard comparably speaking.  Cons- The bbq is more like a bbq gravy, not a real fan. Kinda of clustered atmosphere to pick toppings.  I have been there twice, and it is clean and the food is good."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The food was good and the strawberry lemonade was even better. It was not to sweet and they put real strawberries at the bottom."}
{"text":"Out shopping with a friend. We each got our own and met in the middle to share. She got the cheesesteak, and won because my meal was horrible. My advice is to NOT eat at the outlet at all, maybe a Starbucks. Then go to Kai or Rawhide. Seriously. Ugh. The cheese steak was edible. Not much on it and the small was SMALL. Still a win over the Wok place next door."}
{"text":"always good - I order the peppers and tomato on the grill."}
{"text":"Expensive and it will give u the water shits, the service was ok but I will never go to this place ."}
{"text":"What could go wrong with a steak that is freshly grilled when you order it ...Nothing. There is something about being able to watch your food being cooked right in front of you, that for me is a Winner.The ingredients are fresh and half the battle is won when you can customize it to your taste.  It's one of the Best Subs that i have had in a while and there is no doubt that i will be back for more.Also don't forget to try their Gourmet Fries(Cheese,Bacon & Cheese).The Menu is Simple and Straight but the food will leave you Drooling.Go Get a Napkin!"}
{"text":"Charley's bills itself as the #1 Philly steak sandwich in the world. Those are pretty big britches to fill if you ask me. This chain just opened a location inside the Exxon mini-mart on Route 47 in Mahomet so I decided to check out this place for myself.   The service is definitely small-town friendly as you might expect; you are greeted cheerfully by staff when you walk in. The menu is definitely all sandwich, all the time, with about a dozen different variations of the classic Philly cheese-steak including Buffalo chicken and teriyaki. I tried out the signature Philly with their gourmet fries and a signature lemonade.  Sandwiches may be adorned with a number of different toppings including mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, banana peppers, and jalapeño.   Charley's rendition of this sandwich is pretty decent as fast-food goes, served up hot and fresh as it is made-to-order.  The crusty bread is toasted before your ingredients are generously piled atop. This is definitely the star of the meal. Fries were standard skin-on frozen fried food, but they were reasonably tasty though slightly underdone. To be fair, I visited on the grand opening day so perhaps the cooking processes are still being worked on a bit. The signature lemonade (I chose strawberry lemonade) was a little too sweet for my liking. The strawberry portion was essentially a dollop of frozen strawberry slices in a heavy syrup. It all congealed at the bottom of my cup and wasn't particularly appetizing. I think I'd stick with plain lemonade or pop, or better yet, maybe the tea or water as a beverage choice.  Maybe Charley's sells the most sandwiches in the world but I'm pretty sure I could find a better Philly steak if I headed to Philadelphia. Still, the sandwiches are a good alternative to the boring burger or taco routine so if you're looking to grab a quick bite, Charley's will do the trick nicely."}
{"text":"I don't come to Charley's very often, but I do enjoy subs and since I was at the mall shopping, I decided to come here for lunch. The mall had just opened up, so not many people were eating yet and so I didn't have to wait to put in my order. I ordered the medium Bacon 3 cheese steak sub meal and upgraded my fries to the cheese & bacon gourmet fries. Paid around $12. It was a good amount of food, but this location seems to be really skimpy on their food portions. Very thin slices of meat, but plenty of fill-ins like lettuce. The fries weren't that good at all. The fries were soggy and hardly any cheese or bacon on them. Paid like $2 extra for it and it wasn't worth it! The taste of the sub was pretty good tho. Don't expect anything \"gourmet\" here, but if you want something quick and simple, this might be the place to come to."}
{"text":"Hmmm.... In the Mall food court they always have a cheesesteak place. We stopped to get Cheese Fries.  My son got cheese fries with bacon and he ate them all.  I got just Cheese Fries. I added salt but still very little flavor.  The size was very small for what we paid. The Blueberry Lemonade was good, but made with kind of Blueberry compote. It was thick and sludgy, almost like over poked boba. My grandson shared with me and every time he got a blueberry he gagged.  We got him a Chicken Finger kids meal. The fingers were over cooked and dry, they tasted vaguely of freezer burn. The finger meal comes with NO dipping sauce. I asked for ranch and they said its extra, but then gave it to me free.  We won't be going back. It's was Meh at best."}
{"text":"The food is good that's why we come here but we will be finding a new one to go to every time we come the staff is unprofessional messing around  yelling across the store to one another 2 different visits they were cursing one time they were complaining about another guest and they always have the same Spanish soap opera on the tv I thought this was a family friendly place"}
{"text":"Visited this place on May 27th Derrick provided excellent customer service we need people like him to restore faith in the  fast food environment thank you Derrick will see you when we come back"}
{"text":"We decided to eat at Charley'due to the fantastic smell! However, the product did not equal the advertising. Plenty of bread and hardly any meat. All slathered in mayo. When I tried to talk to the employee, as soon as I said I was unhappy with it he said \"have a nice day\" and turned his back on me."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 62/100  My tip from Dec 10, 2016 - Watch them cook your food & place it in plate. During my visit the girl serving food put a piece of meat that fell on the counter into the sandwich. Reviewer from 20 days ago saw them cook a plastic w/ their meat & didn't remove it till the customer stated it. Doubt I'll eat here again.   I was at the Meadows Mall last Saturday, and looking for a place to eat and this caught my eye. Philly cheese steaks!   Looking at the menu I got the Philly cheese steak with everything on it and upgraded to Ultimate Fries. After I ordered was when I noticed the review about the customer seeing them cook a piece of plastic with his cheese steak and didn't remove it till the customer stated it. I watched them like a hawk while they cooked my food.   The cheese steak and fries were okay, definitely tasted like chain fast food quality. I'd rather go to Pop's down the street. Service was great, it just the quality of cooking and food safety standards that worry me.   If I have to keep an eye on them while they cook my food, it's not a place I would eat at again. Please train employees on how to cook the food, it's not difficult."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby ordered a small philly cheesesteak (each) and the amount of meat and veggies they give you is ridiculous!  It's all bread and definitely not worth the price. The chili cheese fries are also small but tasted good."}
{"text":"Not sure you actually have to buy anything here as you can always get a free sample just by walking past. Surprising enough the sample, California chicken, is pretty tasty, but plain. I also like their cheese fries for a little guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"I had the philly steak sandwich and it sucks big time, tried to get chili cheese fries and at noon time they were out of chili. If you want a very good philly cheese sandwich go down the street to Decatur and Alta because POPS philly steaks are a 1000 times better then this place any day of the week."}
{"text":"1 pm on a Friday, not busy. Friendly, immediate service, offered a sample of something before I even had a chance to order. Everything is too hot to eat so I thought I'd type a review! A little pricey for a simple, but quality fast food meal, but I knew that going in."}
{"text":"Great food with great quality my favorite is the chicken Philly! I am a big fan of philly cheesteaks and by far this is the best place in AZ. They always fresh bread. Never to much meat and never to much bread. There ultimate fries are amazing as well although I have been to a few Charleys around the valley and I find superstition has the worst service they always seem to mees up my order and the cashiers and cooks seem to have little to 0 multitasking skills. I always order the chicken philly with no mushrooms and the cashiers always get it wrong and they always are repeating to themselfs not to put mushrooms. So frustrating. But other than that fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Ordered two regular strawberry lemonade. Stood there for over 6min. The girl forgot that I had orderd them. When I asked her how much longer she just keep say what what what."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  The ultimate fries with ranch are gross!  The sandwich was tasteless and the bread was not very good.  I was hoping for a lot more - not worth the calories.  Won't be back again :("}
{"text":"Sometimes I forget to bring my lunch to work.  I have an hour lunch so I get in my car and drive.  I wound up in this parking lot and it was either Chick Fil A, some teriyaki place, or here.  At the time, a cheesesteak sounded good.  I walked in and placed my order for a large cheesesteak, fries and a drink.  The \"combo\" was a little over $10.00.  Here is how the food was................  Cheesesteak-  A bit skimp.  They cook the meat and onions together on the grill.  The steak was like steak ums and the onions were sparse.  This was topped with provolone cheese and then sandwiched between a toasted roll.  It was just alright.  Not nasty, but not delicious either.  If you get a sandwich here, opt for the extra meat...even then, the quality of the meat isn't that great so you still may be disappointed.  At least the roll was pretty good.  Fries-  These were bordering on decent.  They fry them fresh but that doesn't make them good.  They were not salted either.  I had to douse them in tons of ketchup to make them edible.  They were cut a little too thick....too \"starchy\" and too dang hot for my liking too.  Burned my mouth.  I'd skip them if there is ever a \"next time\".  Coke products and they did have Coke Zero at the fountain which was a positive!  Overall, it was just an ok lunch.  $10.00 isn't outrageous for a lunch combo, but the skimpness of the sandwich and the not so great fries will keep me from heading back.  They do have a survey you can take and get a code for free fries and a drink on your next visit...that's a decent deal right there if you enjoy their food.  Service was friendly, but the food was just average.  Meh.  I've experienced better."}
{"text":"This place...  Who the hell hired your cashier?  Like seriously?! She was rude, inattentive, and just plain clueless.   I mean its mall food, but dang. Very off putting. All I ordered was fries but it felt like I was ruining her day because she had to interact with me. There was a crazy long line, just lackluster employees and that cashier again... she was something else.   I get it, you have a good location and people will go there regardless. Just make it enjoyable."}
{"text":"Manager took my order, and his customer service was exactly what you should expect from a manager!! He was super friendly seemed happy to help and even explained the whole menu when I told him I hadn't been here before.   Now why not the 5 stars? Well... the portion of meat on the sandwich left something to be desired (especially when a meal comes out to $11 and change), and they don't give you trays so unless there's a table available close you have to do a juggling act to carry everything. Other than that food was fresh and tasted good."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here! I had only ever seen a Charley's in a Mall food court, so I was excited to see that we got a free-standing one in Elyria. We got our order to go, I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the Philly cheese steak. We also got an order of fries with cheese. We were both very pleased with our meals and really enjoyed the lemonade too! I love that the blackberry lemonade had fruit puree in it. The service was nice, quick and efficient. Keep up the great work, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches neat presentation with the sandwiches  and the pickle adds the icing on the sandwich,not sloppy, hot fries, great lemonade was so good I came back and got the same thing next day I think they are doing a great job with the service I will be back again"}
{"text":"For the price, my small Philly Cheesesteak was ok.  The taste was fine and the ingredients were cooked correctly, but it was VERY skimpy on the steak.  If I'd paid more, I would have given this two stars given the skimpiness.  I suspect they were trying to keep the calories reasonable in their six inch cheesesteak to attract calorie conscious consumers.  Also, a placement issue - the sign with the available add-on's (peppers, pickles, sauces, etc.) was way down at the end away from the register where you order your actual sandwich.   Service was friendly, professional and fast.  Given all of this, and considering it is a food court place, I think my 3 rating is fair."}
{"text":"It is definitely not the best Philly cheese steak place I ever had, but it is one of the most convenient places to pick up a quick Philly.  They really skimp out on the meat and cheese.  The ultimate fries with cheese and bacon tastes kind of bland.  For now, this place gives me my Philly cheese steak fix, until I find another place somewhere in Phoenix that makes awesome Philly's. Will I keep coming back here? Probably, until I find another better Philly joint."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and wonderful food! Just got a cheesesteak and it was delicious!!"}
