{"text":"What a neat rustic place to hide away for lunch if you enjoy different delicious flavors that mingle in your mouth in all the right ways. Only 4 stars because their soup was overly hot and seamed to separate due to the cream in it but the turkey cranberry goat cheese salad left a lasting impression!"}
{"text":"If you want food that's cooked and ready to go before you even order, this isn't your restaurant. If you appreciate fresh ingredients and meals that are made-to-order, you should definitely stop in and give the String Bean a try."}
{"text":"Really great place to pick from a varied and interesting menu. I've eaten here several times and never had any bad food. You should try the Filet Mignon Pizza."}
{"text":"The food was great as was the service, a little pricy but high quality food so well worth it"}
{"text":"I can't say enough HORRIBLE things about my not-even dining experience at the String Bean tonight. My group- which included my 4 year old daughter and 10 month old son - arrived at 6:36pm (I know exactly because we looked at the car clock when we got out) and were told that the one table that would accommodate our group should be free in 30 minutes. We agreed to stay and wait and even though it was incredibly hot we asked to sit out on the patio  to order drinks in the meantime. Let's fast forward an hour: we are still sitting outside waiting for the inside table. We asked the waitress how much longer we'd have to wait to dine inside and after checking she returned and informed us that the party at our table had just gotten their meals 15 minutes ago. WHAT?!! The manager (owner?) was summoned- Chad - who stood over us with an entitled attitude and didn't apologize for the inconvenience, rather he told us that we were misinformed and that the party'd already eaten and they were waiting to pay, and why didn't we order so that our food would arrive at the same time we were moved inside. Well, at that point I'd had enough. About an hour and twenty minutes after being told we'd be seated in 30 minutes we were still waiting in the heat outside, starving, with two small and now angry children. I got up from my table and took the kids home. I'm so glad I left when I did because my friends spent over three hours waiting for an inside table and their food. They will be writing negative reviews on here as well because unfortunately their experience got far worse after I left. Food was non-memorable, service was obviously terrible, and management did my group \"the favor\" of a  20% discount to try to rectify the situation. Thanks for my $5 off Chad, I'm glad my time and ruined saturday night out was worth so little to you."}
{"text":"The service was exemplary and the food was outstanding. The sugar snap peas and deviled egg appetizers were wonderful. Entrees were delicious and the deserts topped off a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! My son was getting married and I was looking for a place for a rehearsal dinner. Being from out of the area, I thought I would have a lot to worry about, but once I ate lunch at the Stringbean and met the owner, Nate, I knew I would have nothing to worry about and I was right. The food, the drinks, his staff and the location were perfect! Thanks"}
{"text":"Love String Bean,
Always try the specials.
As far as the menu items, love the boom boom shrimp, greek flatbread, comish flat bread, and black bean burger as a wrap.
Wait staff is very personable.
It is definitely one of our local favorites.
The wine prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I went with two coworkers for lunch.  I had a reuben with duck fat fries.  The reuben was fine although the sauce was on the side which was different.  The duck fat fries were soggy and tasted like any other fries.  This was disappointing because I had heard how good they were.  One of my coworkers gor the fried eggplant which was amazing.  If I am in Belmont again I will go again but will not drive from Charlotte just to get here."}
{"text":"The Roger Rabbit collection of roasted vegetables was delicious, same for the fig and arugula pizza. The fish of the day was okay.  The Angus burger was so over-seasoned it was inedible. Service was okay, both at the host stand and at the table.

This is the best sit down restaurant in Belmont, and it's fine. But Cramerton is only a couple miles away and has several affordable 5-star options."}
{"text":"Don't bother!
Not worth the effort the travel time.
Closes early on a Saturday evening.
Lack of business at night."}
{"text":"At least 50 minutes between ordering our brunch meal and the time the food arrived.  I'm a hurry?  Don't come here. 5 star atmosphere, cool place. Just can't abide the wait. Brunch in particular doesn't take long to cook. Full patronage is not a valid excuse for the length of time. The String Bean on its concept alone should be used to that on the weekend. 

One running joke I have on living in the South is slowness of deli, grocery stores or \"restaurant deli\". The String Bean takes it to new lows. 

Food wasn't hot, my chicken and waffles chicken was on the tough side. The flavor a were excellent. My wife's English muffins were burnt. 

The String Bean did give us a generous discount for their issues, but we won't be revisiting."}
{"text":"We ran into some problems last night with some big Christmas parties jamming up the kitchen. Kat took great care if us and even though she was super busy, she took the time to visit with us and feel at home. The food is amazing. The beer and wine list is very comprehensive.  You will not go wrong! A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I've always liked this place, not a lot of good restaurants in the area.  I had not been for a couple of months and went to meet a colleague for lunch. The fish case was empty save for some scallops but they assured me they had fish for tuna salad and fish tacos.  So, I ordered the turn salad and the waitress came back and told me they were out of tuna.  Then, I ordered the fish tacos, which were a special for the day.  After about 10 minutes, she came out and told me they only had enough fish for a partial order. I asked if I could switch to the scallops and she told me they had already prepared the order.  Not sure how they did that since I hadn't agreed to the filling?  So, I got my tacos and they were all chicken and very skimpy, certainly not worth $13.00 for lunch. My colleague ordered a steak sandwich which had about 3 little pieces of steak in it.  I'll give this place one more try, but it has certainly gone downhill."}
{"text":"We went for the first time today. Even though they were not busy in the slightest, it took nearly 45 minutes (!!!!!!) for our food to arrive. How can it possibly take that long to scoop some chicken salad on a croissant and cook a burger? I would hate to see this place when they're busy. The food itself was good, but not worth the exceedingly long wait. Our waitress was okay, but not great. We would go very long stretches of time without seeing her. I don't think I would go back or recommend this restaurant to anyone else. 

If you do go, make sure you aren't hungry when you sit down. You'll have worked up your appetite by the time your food arrives."}
{"text":"Such a great place. Good food and great service. I love their caprese sandwich but everything we have gotten there has been great. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Belmont is a cool place to begin with so even if you have to wait which most of the time you do, you can walk around town to entertain you. They don't have much seating and parking is horrible but once you get seating the service is pretty good but the food is what really stands out. All the food I have tried has been amazing especially dinner specials! But you have not experienced String Bean unless you eat the fried Oreos, but I suggest sharing because you get 5 and you'll already be full from your meal"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!  Huge portions.  The pimento cheese is really good.  Chicken salad is awesome!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend their wine shop, as well as butcher counter.  Bought a ribeye the other day to grill at home. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"String bean is my go to for fresh seafood. They will pretty much order you anything you want if you let them know a day or two ahead of time. There wine selection is great too. They also have a lunch and dinner menu that is great. There Cuban sandwich is on rosemary bread...amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great last night.  The Pesto Filet pie was delicious.  Great wine selection.  Service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Started with the awesome duck fries. I ordered The Bruce Banner Salad. It was easily one of the best salads I've had in my life. Fresh crisp lettuce, blueberries, walnuts, and numerous other fresh ingredients paired with the house made dressing is all a perfect combination.  Would eat here all the time if we lived closer!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but the two times I've been I've had horrible heartburn. I'm thinking they don't change the oil that they cook the fries in. I had the fried green tomato sandwich the first time and the chicken salad the second. Both times heartburn :( won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I found them through a catering job they did for me and that food was stellar but the restaurant/market is relaxed, a bit funky and the service was top notch. Ask for Katie."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience of my life!!! Waited 40-50 minutes for a table with a two year old, 2 one year olds and a 8 week old baby last night (Saturday). Sat down and then waited almost an hour with no food brought out and no one checking in to update us. The children were starving and we were frustrated and getting angry!!!  My husband went inside to see what was going on and spoke to the manager (using a few choice words).  The manager did not apologize AND told him (if he had a problem) to leave the restaurant!!!!!! We were mortified and and begged our server to check on our food since the manager was deplorable and our children were beyond starving at this point.  The server came back and said he was so sorry but the manager ripped up our ticket and told the kitchen to not make our food!!!!  This was two plus hours into our experience here with four small children. We were astounded!  Husband went back in to say how upset we were and to return the expensive bottle of wine we purchased for later.  The manager asked him to step outside and fight?!?!  Mind you, my husband was holding our two year old. Waitstaff all came up to us extremely apologetic and said this manager is awful and apparently is a problem and I can see why.  I will NEVER be back to String Bean!  Can't comment on the food since we never saw any but service was worse than bad!!!!  Not the first time we received bad service here but this was at another level."}
{"text":"Unique and trendy, imaginative menu. Have been there a handful of times, very good always. I do not recommend the market meat counter. I have purchased steaks there and the grade doesn't justify the price.  The restaurant has always been great though. Also great service."}
{"text":"Ambiance isn't much to be admired but the food is delicious. Had a meat & cheese plate with a paired wine selection (waitress didn't know but at least asked the manager/owner) and enjoyed it immensely. Hoping to get back soon for another meal. A little pricey..."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Service is questionable, which leads to the food being questionable. They HAD a decent wine selection but served it in cruddy glasses. Not a first class establishment. Try Luna Hombre for good wine or Glenway or Nellies for food if you are in Belmont. Just say No to String Bean..."}
{"text":"Talked into giving this place another try by my friends.  Yet again, bad waitress, wrong food, incorrect check, and not even on par with panera.  This place would be excellent if it was managed, too bad it's not.  At least my 4 friends now agree and we can exclude this place as a choice."}
{"text":"Love the place, worth a trip if you haven't been. I would rate them a 4.5 out of 5, but it doesn't let me do half stars. Let me say that this is our go to place for Saturday brunch. We usually get an egg/protein dish (choose your own topping omelets have replaced the omelet bar) and The Curious George to split for \"dessert\". Who doesn't love French toasted slices of banana nut bread with vanilla rum syrup, warm bananas and pecans? I mean...it's decadent, but too much for one person to eat. The ambiance is right on--with a funky marketplace vibe. The only negatives were that once we had to wait over 25 minutes because they'd just opened and \"someone didn't buy any bananas\" (which our server didn't mention when we ordered) and that on occasion the portions seem underscaled for the plates. The choose your own eggs benedicts come as is. No sides, no garnish. Just a couple of muffins with eggs, meat and sauce. Same with the omelet. Just sits there on the plate. Tasty, but not a visual feast. For such a fun, hip place it could do with an orange slice on a piece of lettuce or a little side of potato hash to dress it up--especially for the prices. Sweet potato hash would be divine, if the manager is reading!"}
{"text":"My very first visit to The String Bean and I'm hooked! Loved the ambience - very sociable. Leah, our waitress was super friendly. I had the absolute best black bean burger in the world. Very vegetarian & pescatarian friendly.  You can eat indoors or on the patio. Although I didn't have one (because I had to return to work from lunch), The String Bean has a fantastic beer selection. Nice wine selection, too. Very friendly and attentive staff. This is one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"Soup was excellent!  Service was great. They actually use real ham, carved off the bone, in their ham and brussels sprout soup!

Love real food!"}
{"text":"The fried green tomatoes was excellent. Place is a little on the pricey side. $50 for two without any alcohol. I got the blackened halibut over grits and greens. Meal was very good and place wasn't to loud. Would recommend to anyone wanting a nice night out or a date night."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check this place out on a whim - the patio is an awesome place to sit and have a glass of wine. The pork belly tacos are AMAZING. The Cuban sandwich is also delicious. Great drink choices, great ambiance. One of my favorite places in Belmont."}
{"text":"Food is good but pricey. It's always cold inside but staff are attentive. I recommend the daily specials."}
{"text":"Really a great place, locally sourced foods, and very nice staff. Had the bison burger with eggplant fries and a bbq egg roll for an appetizer. Egg roll was delicious, fries were great and the burger was ok. Bison can get a little dry due to low fat content but it was cooked perfectly. Be prepared to wait a little between courses, everything is freshly made so it's worth it. Only downside, if you sit inside it's very narrow. I almost fell over someone leaving."}
{"text":"I have been to the String Bean a handful of times. Usually I sat inside at the bar because most tables inside were occupied but the last time we were there we sat outside for dinner in a pleasant fall evening. 

The hostess only gave us the food menu and asked if we need the drink menu. The String Bean is known for its beer selection and my husband loves his IPAs, so of course, but we waited quite a while before another hostess brought it to us. Since we didn't have the drink menu when our assigned waitress came to take drink orders, my husband asked what IPAs they have. She said she needed to check and left. When she came back, my husband had the drink menu that was just dropped off and asked for a seasonal NC beer on tap. Nope we are out, so he asked for a NC bottled beer listed on the menu. Our waitress left and came back empty-handedly. He asked for yet another NC bottled beer and it was unavailable either. Finally the fourth one he asked for was available. You would expect the waitress would bring it out right away but it was not the case. 

Ordering food was not as hard as ordering drinks but our patience was tested again waiting for the food. It was around 7:30 PM on a weekday and the restaurant was full, so I guess it's kind of understandable. My husband ordered a southwest chicken wrap, and guess what. it wasn't cut into half when it came out. It looked like a burrito! I tried the eggplant fries for the first time and it wasn't bad but the sea salt sprinkles made them too salty for me. The sweet potato fries were sprinkled with sea salt as well which I can also do without. The spicy butternut squash soup was fine. 

When I first moved to the area, the String Bean seemed to be the place to be in Belmont. Less than a year later, I felt the lure has faded. I think the menu was updated a few months ago with a slight increase in prices and less options. Moreover, I have my new favorite restaurant in Belmont now. With a booming restaurant scene in this charming town, even a well-established place.like the String Bean needs to up its game."}
{"text":"Duck fat fries rule! My favorite thing here is that fresh meat I can buy and grill at home, don't forget the wine or beer- Lots to choose from. 
I did place a meat order once and never got a calm back saying it was in or could not be purchased, being veal shank it was available somewhere."}
{"text":"I decided to go here after reading the reviews. I wanted to try the food which was great. I didn't like the parking and the service was so slow. The place is nice and cute definitely worth trying but I won't go back due to service. My waitress just seemed like I was bothering her. She just wasn't friendly nor was I impressed with her she just had this I don't care attitude."}
{"text":"Great place, lots of variety.  Food is awesome, staff is very friendly.  When it's cold/rainy seating is limited to inside which is nice but can make it a decent wait if a busy night."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I had edamame, fried green tomatoes, Italian sandwich with the pasta salad for side ( it was all incredible). Great outside seating patio and atmosphere. Will be back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, beer selection, and service! We went for the first time last night with some family from out of state, and we all loved this place. Love the little market area up front with whole bean coffee, beer, and some misc goodies. The food was wonderful. We split the fried pickles and duck fat fries as an appetizer. The pickles were huge slices of what tasted like homemade pickles. The fries were so flavorful and a great presentation in the fry basket with dipping sauces. As a meal, I got the Cuban sandwich with pasta salad. The sandwich was huge and i only hate half. It definitely wasn't an authentic Cuban, but was delicious nonetheless. :) We loved the beer selection and everyone went home full and happy. Great service to top it off. Will return!"}
{"text":"Visiting a friend brought us to this quaint town of Belmont. Love this place with its antique stores and small boutiques. We decided on a nice dinner at String Bean and were not disappointed. This place can get crowded however they do their best to pack in as many as possible while not making you feel like a sardine.

Benita was our waitress and she was great and very knowledgeable when asked for suggestions about food and beer. She allowed us to enjoy a couple of beers first as requested. Feeling pressured to order food leaves a bad taste in my mouth. So it was nice to kick back and catch up before ordering.  Since they had so many great things we wanted to try, we chose to share the eggplant fries, bison quesadilla (a must have), and figgylicious pizza! The food was superb and hit the spot. Also, although it can get crowded, we were able to have pleasant conversation without the urge to yell or talk over the next table.

This place has wonderful and friendly staff, delicious food and a pretty good selection of craft beers, which was a pleasant surprise. Definitely will be back here whenever we are in town!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Belmont, NC just between Charlotte and Gastonia.  Good selection of food, beer and wine.  I had the CowPig burger with Duck Fat Fries.  Both were delicious, but eat your fries fast, so they are nice and warm. 

The service was also great. 

Seems like a great little local spot that will recognize you after a couple of trips."}
{"text":"The cow pig burger is a tough dense over salted poorly cooked excuse for a burger. How do you dry out a burger with bacon in the meat? 
The duck fat fries are good but fried in under temp oil, and here is a tip, don't serve the bottom of the bag to your customers! I got a bowl of fry pieces. 

The picture also shows the \"lettuce wrap\" two pieces of limp two day old lettuce. 

Dry bacon burger? It takes real skill to screw that up."}
{"text":"My wife and I just had a wonderful lunch.  She had the Brunch special of the Curious George, and it was great.  I had the Pig-Cow burger which was wonderful.  The staff was nice and kept our drinks full.  

Great food and atmosphere, we will be back"}
{"text":"We usually go here at least once or twice a month. They have a ton of beers and interesting specials everyday. The southern Reuben is worth trying three to four times"}
{"text":"Friend's halibut salad looked awesome, but I ordered a medium filet mignon and thought it would be a nice treat from a butcher. It came to the table beyond well done and no server inquired about temperature. I've never not eaten a filet because of temperature but this was awful. The servers were great and they did take it off the bill but I ended up eating a a different restaurant down the street later."}
{"text":"Came to String Bean for the first time after another restaurant gave us a bad experience. We were very happy with the food (it was amazing) and the amount of beer choices! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with this place other than I LOVE IT.  Food is absolutely fantastic, dog friendly patio, nice wine selection and Pops was able to locate Caduceus Naga for me!  I've had grouper, duck fat fries, twice baked potato and the spicy burger...all fantastic!  One of my friends had the salmon (she is a salmon snob) and said it was the best she has ever had.  This is a little bit of a drive from my house but totally worth it and will be a weekly stop for me.  Thanks Pops and thanks to the wait staff for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food and Amazing \"dish of the day\" options, but what got me the most is the incredible extensive beer and options they have. Definitely a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has as good as reviews as it does.  It's shocking!  Is this the String Bean in Belmont or am I on the wrong thing here?  Anyway, I believe I'm at the correct location so let me explain.  I've eaten here several times.  Why might you ask?  Because I live 5 minutes from downtown Belmont and I want it to be good.  I want it to be so good! I want to go on here and say, \"Yes! Yes I tell you! String Bean is a great restaurant!\" But it's not.  I don't know how it has such solid reviews as my girlfriend, father, and friends all share my sentiments.  I have NEVER had a meal prepared for me there in a reasonable amount of time.  It always takes forever.  Rarely do they get the order right.  Their waiters/waitresses consistently disappear throughout dinner and you're just out of luck if you run out of beer or water.  I want to continue to eat here because its close, but rightfully so my girlfriend is so fed up with the bad service she refuses to go.  Once delivered at the table the food and beer are good.  However, you will be too upset with the delay and problems occurring around you to enjoy it.  It is not cheap either!  Look, the location is wonderful and that is the ONLY reason it is surviving!  I would love for chef Ramsay to come here and jerk a knot in these peoples tails, it would be amazing!  But until things change at this place, I am not eating here"}
{"text":"I had a great experience catering part of iour Thanksgiving feast with The String Bean. Taylor was extremely responsive and helpful with planning my order by email and phone. The smoked turkey and sides were great. 

I've been to the restaurant a few times for lunch and enjoy their grass fed burger too. 

I would definitely use this restaurant for future catering needs."}
{"text":"Great food, a huge variety of affordable, interesting beer, and an on-site butcher - what's not to like? The vibe is nice as well - classy yet relaxed, with dark woods and an elegant layout.

A couple of friends brought us to this place and we had an excellent meal for four without breaking the bank. My burger in particular was good, and this is one of the few places that will make a legitimate 'medium rare' burger.

We'll be heading back."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Belmont and we stopped because we were headed to see the Christmas lights. The string bean was recommended to us by someone at one of the stores we stopped in to, and so we decided to try it.

When you first walk in, you walk through their Deli area and they have a great selection of meats and wine. We sat outside, and even though it was a little cool, we were near the fireplace and it was pleasant.

Feel bad because I'm writing this review several weeks after eating here, and I can't remember what I had! However, I do remember that it was very good and we both enjoyed our meals immensely. Our server was incredibly kind and helpful, and we fully intend to return to try more menu items.

We have both also recommended this place to several of our friends who are planning to visit Belmont. If you find yourself there and looking for something to eat, I would highly recommend The String Bean"}
{"text":"We love this place, especially for brunch. Dinner is a bit more busy and you may be a little rushed depending on the server, but all in all it's a very nice atmosphere. The food is quite fresh and there are some real gems on there. They have bison, which we love. The beer selection is among the best in the area, and if you're just in the market for a couple of brews and some steak at the butcher area, they have a great selection of that as well. If weather permits, we suggest taking it outside on the patio. It's not a huge place, but it's worth the wait if there is one."}
{"text":"I love this place but it's not always consistent. It is always packed which is wonderfully but it would probably help if they hired more staff so you didn't band to wait 15-20 minutes to get a drink. We had a few burgers they were cooked to order and the fries were yummy. Unless you like pickles do not get the chicken fingers because that's all you'll taste :( they normally have a great beer selection but some times they are out of a lot of things. This is a place you definitely need to visit in Belmont but it's not the number one place to go."}
{"text":"I am not one to low ball a rating. This place owns its low ranking. On the positive side, they do have a great patio area. That is where the positives stop. We have attempted to dine here 3 times. I have a simple 3 strike rule. I can't speak for their food, because we have never made it that far, in three attempts, not even once. I will say this, the people working on the wait staff and the hostess area could truly and honestly care less if you dine with them, or if you ever come back. In all three attempts, one thing that rings true is this place has a terrible attitude, very crude people. ZERO customer service ability. Upon attempting to take my daughters and their friends there this weekend, we were treated very rudely and not friendly at all. After standing in front of the Hostess booth for 6 minutes with a hostess right in front of us, it took me getting her attention before she even took my name. Then she said just wait over there it's going to be a while. A while? What does a while mean? Oh it was incredibly disappointing. If these guys don't want to be in business, they have the right attitude. I am convinced, the only reason that they are still open, is their prices are astronomical, which in most cases I have no issue with, as long as the service is commensurate."}
{"text":"On entry, not so good. The place smelled of burnt cooking oil. Once seated, Lefty and I picked two apps and they are out; picked a beer, out; Lefty wanted a Sun Drop Soda, out; I pick a hard cider; not out but the last bottle. This was on top of the 2 menu items that they were out of. :0/ it must be my cologne.

I was so deflated, we just ordered a couple of available apps; the bbq egg rolls and Duck fat fries. We followed up with the fried Oreos with ice cream.

The fries were crisp and light, A definite plus. The BBQ egg rolls had plenty of meat but the shell was too overcooked and too crispy, which made the Q dry.

The fried O-R-E-O's were awesome! They are dipped in funnel cake batter and served smothered with vanilla ice cream with a sundae sauce drizzle. I would have preferred the ice cream on the side to lessen the quick melting and enhance the presentation (for Yelp photo). I learned after it was served (and devoured) that it was an option.

We had to wait, but there were plenty of empty tables :0(. The server (Kevin) was great; knew the menu and very friendly.

This menu reads great, but with so many things not available on a Saturday night it's just a good fiction read. Another point was that Left had a different menu than mine (old vs. new) 

Though I was really disappointed in this visit I will try again when in the area.

The patrons all seemed relaxed and happy, so this must have been an off night.

Lots of wine bottles on deck, I gotta step my grape game up

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Compared with other delis and sandwich restaurants, this place is a solid five star place. The food was very tasty and the menu had some creative interesting items on it. Everything seemed fresh and well-prepared. I especially loved the horseradish mustard that was so wonderfully strong that the horseradish brought tears to my eyes. That's how it always should be :) 

We had fun with their extremely large beer list and thought the prices were really fair compared with what we had paid for the same bottled beers elsewhere.

The service was perfectly fine on the day we went. I know other people here have often complained about it, but our server was knowledgeable about their menu items and drinks and brought things out reasonably quickly. Granted, it was a Wednesday afternoon, but still, that is the experience I am basing this review on. Very happy, would come back whenever I am in Belmont again."}
{"text":"I used to dig this place but it's gotten way too expensive and the service isn't nearly as good as it used to be. They have a great selection of craft beer but the prices are OUT OF CONTROL! On average you will pay $3-5 more for any given sixpack. They are currently selling 4 packs of Burial for $18 + tax and singles for 5 bucks. This is greed pure and simple. I will not return or recommend Stringbean to anyone until they stop gouging."}
{"text":"Have been here half dozen times since moving to the Belmont area in March. WOW!  Very impressed every time i go!  Must see in Belmont!"}
{"text":"Fun and cute restaurant with very friendly and attentive wait staff. Order came pretty fast, food was good. Loved the meat case and wine for purchase area. The only thing that would make it better is a full bar service. I don't care for beer and I'm not a big wine drinker."}
{"text":"Earthy, hipster atmosphere that emphasizes quality and where your food comes from. Large portions, extremely tasty & decent service."}
{"text":"Stopped in based on local recommendation. At first the place seemed to have a lot of potential with an interesting atmosphere. The waitress was very pleasant, but seemed frazzled and it only worsened as the evening wore on. They were out of a variety of items I asked for ranging from beverages to dishes. I stopped asking after the fifth item and just asked what they did have. Ended up with the caprese pannini. It was very mediocre with little flavor. They also used the stem end of the tomato, so my first bite was very tough. All that being said, I'd like to try them again in case this was just an off night."}
{"text":"I love this place. I stay near Belmont just so I can run at the whitewater center and eat at the string bean. Kudos to the place and their staff. Great veg choices and premium microbrews, even some from my home state of Oregon."}
{"text":"Good creative southern dishes. I really enjoyed the Southern Reuben with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at the great service and food. The staff was very accommodating to my food prep issues. That alone is worth 5 stars.
I ordered the Black and Blue Rib Eye rare and it came out rare! They also let me switch sides at no extra charge. My Husband got the Southern Reuben with sweet potato fries and was very happy with it. We will definitely go there again. Fun atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"This catering shop/deli/bottle shop is worthy of a major city.  Belmont is quite lucky to have them.  Its not necessarily the cheapest option around, but well worth the money.

I'm just going to reiterate what most everyone else has already said.  Get the duck fat fries!  And go sit outside if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Excellent wine and beer menu. Great burgers (I had the bison!) and quick attentive service even when busy. Worth getting off the highway if you are looking for a great stop."}
{"text":"We like this place.  It's a great addition to downtown Belmont.  You can stop by on your way home, sit at the bar and choose from the extensive draught list or take a bottle home.  There is a fresh meat counter where you can find excellent cuts of beef, fish and house-made concoctions like the cow-pig burger (a yummy mix of beef and bacon). The combination of a diverse menu, cool atmosphere (with indoor and patio seating) and good service will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Friday night date at the String Bean was great! First time here and I will be back! Close to my Nanny job and lots of great choices on the menu. This sweet spot also has a meat and cheese counter and a decent selection of wines, beers and the like 

I had the Southwestern Chicken Wrap with duck fat fries and I would get it again! I ordered mine minus the black beans since I'm not a fan, but the chicken was plentiful and flavorful and with just a hint of heat. The duck fat fries were worth the $2 up charge and crispy, well seasoned though too many for my appetite tonight. 

Hubby had The String Bean Steak Burger cooked medium with homemade chips and was super pleased. I tasted the cooked edge since I'm a medium well girl, but it was quite flavorful!  The chips were good, though probably not at the top of the list for best ever. 

We ordered the White Chocolate Oreo Cheesecake to go since we were full but wanted to try one of the in house made offerings. It looks delish!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Impressed with the market. Had the reuben with homemade chips. The meat was tough and without much flavor. The chips were cold and tough as though they had been sitting for a while. My wife had the southwest wrap and it was equally unimpressive. The fired pickles were also very disappointing (too much breading, and too thickly sliced). Won't ever be going back. Very bummed, as this place came very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Saturday. There was a short wait to sit inside. They have a nice patio and seating was available immediately outside. Since it was 90 degrees, we opted to eat inside. We ate off of the brunch menu and had the big BECky, and the Belmont Hot Chicken biscuit. Both came with home potatoes. The biscuits were HUGE, and it was all very good. The mimosas were good as well. Our service was good, and even though the kitchen was a little slow, our waitress brought us some chips and dip without us asking for them. Nice touch!  We will be back for lunch or dinner in the future."}
{"text":"Perfect little spot for dinner and drinks. I will definitely be back!  We had the boom boom shrimp, i had the pear salad with grilled chicken and my friend had the pork chop with risotto.  We each had some wine to go with dinner.   Very familyish type feel. I like it because its unique and not a chain type.  Not over priced and great service.  See pics of the food."}
{"text":"Wow! Today is my birthday and we stopped here for lunch. We fell into the right place. The service and food were both amazing. I had the BLT with fried green tomatoes and house made potato chips. The sandwich was the perfect combination of ingredients. The chips were crispy and delicious. I mentioned it was my birthday and the waitress brought out a plate of profiteroles on the house. What wonderful surprise. Thank you, String Bean."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night - it was amazing. I have celiac disease and even though they do not have a separate allergy menu they were able to work with me and let me know what was available and what was not. They do not carry GF bread or rolls but can do lettuce wraps for burgers and sandwiches. Unfortunately they were out of the duck fat fries that they are known for (yes I was told they're gluten free) so we had the deviled eggs with sugar bacon and they were delicious. I ordered the sushi grade tuna salad with wasabi dressing & it was fantastic & I would order it again in a heartbeat. The waitress was very nice and helpful especially with my dietary needs. They have a large selection of hard ciders, beers, and wines. Overall, I would recommend the string bean but definitely call ahead and try to sit outside if you can - inside can get a little tight when it's busy."}
{"text":"We keep coming back! 

This place is usually packed and sometime there is a wait, but it's worth it. They have some of the best food in Belmont and an exceptional patio. 

The menu is pretty big and covers all of the bases from fancy apps to classic burgers. For me, it's a toss up between the philly and the spicy chicken sandwich. My husband loves just about everything but the angry cowpig usually wins when it's time to order. The staff works hard on busy nights to keep everything moving so remember when it's busy, you might have to wait a bit. 

The patio is awesome. Love music some nights and the lighting can feel a bit romantic. Great place to take in a cocktail and meet up with friends. Inside and get a little loud and hectic so head outside for a slower pace."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and the Beer selection is amazing !! I found this food while visiting from San Diego !!! Must go to again !!!! French fries in duck fat , fried green tomatoes, and fried picks were fabulous!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars simply for their beer selection and menu choices. I like dark beers like porters and stouts. So RJ recommended that I try the coconut porter that was on tap. Wow! I was blown away. It's brewed by Catawba valley if I remember correctly. Nevertheless, this is now the best porter I have ever had. Moving on to the menu. Now I'm a light eater, especially when I'm drinking beer. (Our motto in the Marine Corps was that there's a sandwich in every beer) so the problem I usually run into at other places with respectable draft selections is that if I want to eat, it's all heavy stuff. So when I saw the green monster on the menu i did the silent fist pump thingy. Then I saw fried pickles too. So I went with the fries green tomatoes (green monster) and it was heaven. When the bartender (Jen, Awesome) brought it out to me I thought there had been a mistake. They looked like huge crab cakes! So after she convinced me that they were actually tomatoes, I dug in. There was a light cream sauce poured over them and they were awesome! To top it off, you can order a six pack from the cooler (as it is also a market) and they bag it for you and add to tab right at the bar. So I ordered a six of rogue porter and was on my way. (The coconut porter was only on tap:( I love this place!"}
{"text":"I love the String Bean, esp sitting on the nice outdoor patio or an indoor high top 4 seater. The service, food, and drink choices are always on point. It's a casual place with a fresh meat / seafood counter.. can order to cook at home as well. It's consistently yummy."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Eggplant fries and calamari apps very good. The entrees were disappointing. Smoked meatballs were not there just meat sauce. Oysters came with meal instead before. Al a carte not properly presented on Entrees. Server not attentive. DO NOT ORDER ENTREES!  WAIT WAS FOREVER!"}
{"text":"OK so I like pepper, I know. On a flight to Peru a little elderly Abuelita took my pepper away and scolded me for using too much . What else could I do but beg for it back. Thank goodness she was belted in or she may have spanked me. Don't mess with Peruana Abuelitas!!

The Catawba Cobb salad is what's pictured. It was FABULOUS & FRESH!!!! Very YUMMY  I would say you are missing out on a wonderful GEM if you don't eat here. One of the best in Belmont (Charlotte area) NC. Come here right now and FEAST!!!"}
{"text":"Best Burgers, fish,  and steaks, In the area.  Ribeye is my favorite and there shrimp are better than at the beach."}
{"text":"Needed. Place to grab a sandwich on the way to the airport...what we found was awesome! Amazing brunch menu...the Curious George was outstanding and the girls loved the duck-fat fries.  Really cool service, nice people...we'll be back!
Next time we will partake of the cool beer list!"}
{"text":"We closed this joint down. I just love to use joint in the context of a place as much as possible. No, I don't smoke them though I do reside in Denver. 

I give the wine a solid 7.5/10 because they have choice and the beer, which I didn't drink, a 9/10 because it was local. 

I had the meatloaf, \"Ma Meatloaf!!!\" 
I can't resist.

My travel companion also had the meatloaf and we both agreed that with the mashed potatoes underneath, it was plenty flavorful. 

What I liked was that there were plenty of fresh options as it was half store, half butcher counter and half seafood counter and there were several catch of the day selections. My other travel partner had fish and loved it. 

We did eat dessert, a key lime tart and fried Oreo cookies. The key lime tart was really good but I got a bite of the Oreos and it wasn't my favorite. I just don't like fair food. But, you might as fried anything is always a worthy menu addition. 

I liked the ambiance of the whole scene, a quaint little place with a great big patio. Buy local y'all!"}
{"text":"The concept is great, but the execution is not.  It's too bad, because I wanted to like this place.

I appreciate the fact they have a large beer selection by the bottle and that the prices aren't too bad.  Our waitress was very nice as well.  But what I don't appreciate is that for a sandwich and burger joint, dinner service took 2 hours!  We were there from 6:30 to 8:30pm.  Not only was I disappointed with the time it took to get our food, the \"cuban sandwich\" I ordered was nothing of the sort.  Seriously, it tasted like an \"italian\" style sandwich, and the bread was not grilled.  To top it all off, for the two hours I was there, I had to go next door to use the restroom because their facility was out of order."}
{"text":"Upscale food and wine shopping and lovely patio dining. Attracts out of area patrons for their unique ambiance. Be sure to try it when you're in Belmont."}
{"text":"I love coming here on a regular basis. It's loud when you sit inside, but their patio is a great spot in warmer weather. Great beer selection, although I would prefer to see at least one \"normal\" beer on draft all the time. They rotate their drafts which is good, but they are all usually flavored, trendy type beers. It would be good for those of us who like a real beer (AKA OMB Copper) to have options. As for food, the duck fat fries are so good! Burgers are great, try the Cowpig. It's a great spot in a cool town."}
{"text":"String Bean is my FAVORITE!! They catered our wedding and are a go-to for date night for my husband & me. It's also my go-to with any out-of-town guests or folks who may be unfamiliar with the area.

Boom Boom Shrimp are a vital part of every String Bean Meal! The Cowpig is also definitely within my top picks. Their specials & brunch are always delicious, too! From beginning to end (String Bean boasts a wonderful pastry/dessert chef) and for any & all beer/wine needs, String Bean is the way to go!"}
{"text":"What a little gem in downtown Belmont.  I've been twice and have been happy both times - a nice menu with a lot of options for dinner and appetizers (the duck fat fries were awesome!) with a tremendous beer selection.  They have a deli and a small store in the front part.  Overall, it's a very unique place and if you are ever passing through Belmont and want to grab a beer or bite to eat (and sit outside with the tiki torches!), I would really recommend the String Bean!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome beer / wine selection. Nice patio for eating outside. Convenient location in downtown Belmont."}
{"text":"I have been to the String Bean numerous times and have always really enjoyed the food and experience. As a vegetarian, it can be tricky to find variety, but there are lots of choices here. They also have a great selection of beer and wine. The eggplant fries are a must!"}
{"text":"The other day my brothers college tennis coach had recommended this place to us since we didn't know the area too well and once we got to the parking lot the first thing we noticed was how busy it was, so parking was more difficult than first thought , but once we got in we were seated quicker than we nearly right away and service there was very slow for us taking the server nearly 10 minutes to get to us and once she got to us ,she was very kind and knowledgeable with the menu so after we ordered the server offered some chips for us to snack on while we waited, however the chips took FOREVER to get here we waited about another 10 minutes and by the time the chips got here the food was already here , food quality was amazing but service was poor in my option"}
{"text":"Second time at the Bean, they didn't disappoint.  If you go for brunch, try the chicken & waffles (with mimosas).  They also have a bloody mary bar that looked pretty cool.

If you go any other time, try the Cow Pig or the Don burgers.

Their beer selection is fun and they carry some fun local hard ciders as well. 

Their parking lot is small, so plan your timing accordingly."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with some coworkers. None of us had been before and we were all pleasantly suprised. It was a beautiful day to sit on the patio, which is really nice.  I had the habenero broccoli soup to start and it was amazing.  Then I had the bf&b sandwich with their house made chips. The sandwich was good,  though the jam on it was really heavy on the ginger.. just not my thing,  not a knock on their food. The chips were good but not as good as some places I've been.  A few tables got the tater top app and it looked amazing.  I would also like to try the deviled eggs next time.  Last, the beer list looked amazing and I want to go back again when I can actually have one!  :-)"}
{"text":"Just moved to Belmont last month and have been here 2 times. Some of the best food I have ever had. My wife and I love this place. And Justin waited on us both times, he is on top of his profession, the best, so ask for him to have a wonderful dinner experience."}
{"text":"Second trip to Belmont. Wouldn't miss lunch and a pint at the Bean. Gems like this are worth shouting about. Don't miss out. If you're a local, please support this brilliant cafe, deli, butcher and beermonger. If it's not here the next time I'm in town, I'm blaming y'all. And there will be hell to pay!"}
{"text":"I almost awarded them only three stars as they're the only establishment I encountered in my 5 day stay who seemed gave me any attitude. The food, however is what we went for and the food delivered. I highly recommend the Fig-Prosciuto flat-bread and the BF &B. The fried pickles and duck fat fries are very good as well.

I was very unimpressed with the cavalier attitude given when they lost the credit card. No apology was offered when they discovered the card had indeed not made it back to the table (our server insisted she had returned it) and was instead on the floor between the register and restrooms."}
{"text":"My friends and I had dinner reservations here Thursday night for outdoor seating    When we arrived they said it was full and sat us out by the front sidewalk.  We were not thrilled but we sat there and enjoyed wine and dinner.  Pops was awesome in helping me select a great wine Genesis.   We stopped by again today as it was slow and the same young lady hostess told us there were no seats for 3 out in that area and sat us up front by sidewalk again.   The garden area we asked for was Virtually empty   Gordon was our waiter and he was fabulous.   Fact:  businesses go out of business regularly due to a bad attitude of one employee. We won't be back.   Get a new hostess for greeting and seating guests"}
{"text":"Don't let the silly name fool you!  Our meals were delicious!   I had a bison burger that was out of this world!  My friend had a chicken wrap that was also great.  We both had sweet potato fries as a side, and they were really good fries.  They have a huge selection of beers and wines.  There is a nice patio to eat on as well.  My only down point was the guitar player they hired that was playing leads to a rhythm track he recorded; that got really annoying after the second song (30 minutes of the same rhythm tracks and same leads.  Imagine listening to the Venture's \"Wipe Out\" for 1/2 an hour, lol!)  Aside from that, I will be back."}
{"text":"Their food is very tasty. I ate there twice in one week. Had fried oyster for lunch and Ahi Tuna for dinner.  The Ahi Tuna could be seared with higher heat for texture and color, however the seasoning brought it over the top."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and saw The String Bean on Yelp. The daily seafood special was  local flounder with roasted red potatoes and cranberry bacon Brussels sprouts. It was probably the best flounder I've ever had, and the sides were amazing too! On top of food being just awesome, the place also offers some market items such as fresh cuts of meat, beer, and wine. Ambiance is casual and fun, and service was great. Will def be back and hope to share with some friends or family!"}
{"text":"It was a cold, rainy Tuesday night; there were only a few diners in the restaurant, and they sat me at the bar. The bartender came over- I ordered a beer, and he told me the day's menu specials. He didn't state the price. I ordered the grouper with collards and Brussels sprouts, and later had a second beer- that's all. The food was very good. When he left the check, I was a little surprised. With tip, it was over $45! Now I don't mind paying for good food in a nice place, but to sit at the bar in The String Bean, which to be kind is to say it's rustic; and to be charged prices of a high-end white linen restaurant is just wrong. I think they gouged me to make up for the lack of customers. This was my first and last time to eat at The String Bean in Belmont, NC."}
{"text":"Very cute local restaurant in small Belmont, which doubles as a butcher shop and a wine store.  Food and service were excellent, we had the halibut, which was very good.  My only criticism is that the cushions need replacing -- you sink down too far in them.  But there are plenty of chairs to use instead.  Overall, an excellent find in Belmont."}
{"text":"So good. I got the Burger perfectly cooked and dressed with duck fat fries :0 amazing. The meat was buttery and the fries were beyond any kind I've had, this actually was my first time having duck fat fries and I'll never be able to enjoy regular fries now.  If your in the area go to string bean, it'll grow hair on your chest."}
{"text":"Wow! Passing through Belmont on the way to Asheville for work, I was NOT expecting such a great dining experience! The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was nice and the food was outstanding! I had the portobello sandwich with sweet potato fries and grilled asparagus- seriously so good and the fries were crisped to perfection!"}
{"text":"They have the best Reuben in the area.  There home made chips and ranch dressing are great.  The tomato and mozzarella appetizer is delicious and more like a meal than an appetizer."}
{"text":"I'm addicted. Can't lie. I look for a reason to not cook dinner just so we can eat here once a week. Suck at life. I LOVE The Cuban.. Amazing sandwich! The Philly Hoagie is fab! The CowPig is pretty freaking great! Turkey Croissant is so-so after eating the other sandwiches. It's good but not amazing like the warm sandwiches. The pasta is good, fries are wonderful, just tried the eggplant fries.. NUM NUM along with the duck fat fries! My new fav.... Chicken & Dumplings Gnocchi!!!!!!! Nice and creamy chicken and dumpling... full of flavor and then a great tangy kick with with the braised red cabbage. Totally hooked.. Hard to please and this place is consistently GOOOOOD!"}
{"text":"The String Bean has the BEST fried pickles. The burgers are fantastic. Great fries. Fresh, authentic ingredients and a great atmosphere which is bar style. The patio is nice in the evening...string lights and a fireplace. Definitely a local favorite."}
{"text":"To the best of my knowledge, they have by far the best bottled beer selection this side of Charlotte. They have a great mix of beers and a nice variety of NC beers and beyond. 

As far as the restaurant goes, we've eaten here a couple times. We've been satisfied, but nothing that makes us crave or need to come back just for the food. Last time in i tried the String Beaner which is a flatbread pizza with pimento cheese, chorizo and onions. It was a tasty choice and i might even order it again in the future. 

i don't know what goes on with the meat/cheese section here. It just kind of throws me off or i'm too chicken to inspect it closer. 

My only real complaint is that i always seem to need to replenish my beer supply on a Sunday or a Monday and they are closed. Boo."}
{"text":"Extraordinary beer selection l. Great service and fare. Aubs and I shared the pesto flat bread and the southern Cesar salad, both great. The flat bread comes with filet mignon cubed on every slice, Carmelized onions and fresh mozzarella. This place is also a grocery but they're known for their cow pig sandwich: according to the menu it's a bacon burger with a large serving of bacon, sounds good but no one at our table ordered it, I'm not one to mess with the already wildly successful formula of bacon on a hamburger. The southern Cesar salad is a Cesar salad but with cornbread croutons and a heavy serving of fried chicken. What's not to like about that. I wouldn't hesitate to get either item again."}
{"text":"My wife and I love eating here. Everything is always hot and fresh! The fried Oreos are a must! Great quality food, great staff, awesome craft beer selection, great place to take the whole family! If they made their home made mac and cheese a regular menu item, I would have given them a sixth star."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with consistency, because I have only been here once, but the one time was a five star experience. First of all, I did not expect this restaurant to have a cute little wine store with some gift options...plus what looks to be a small seafood/butcher counter. It is an adorable restaurant, and I love that you can support it by buying actual merchandise as well as food. For lunch I got the mozz/pesto panini with chicken and sweet potato fries. The sandwich was excellent...but the sweet potato fries may have been the best I have ever had. Maybe they are fooling me and the fries aren't homemade...but you would never know. They are fantastic! I will go back and hopefully have the same 5 star time, and I will definitely keep you posted."}
{"text":"Great little spot. It's a butcher shop, specialty beer/wine market, and restaurant! They have so many options on the menu, which I loved! 

For apps/bites we tried fried green tomatoes w their homemade pimento cheese, and it was my favorite that we chose. Due to reviews we had to try duck fat fries. They were tasty, but I think a little overcooked.  I wanted to try the ban mi rolls, which sounded amazing. 

The bison burger was substantial in size. I think the pickles over powered the flavor, and they didn't put a sauce on it, but it definitely could have used one. The meat was cooked medium and a little gamey (I think because of the lack of sauce). 

Overall ambiance and experience is A+ and food was super unique. It's nice to experience something different with fresh/homemade ingredients. I'm tired of restaurants that buy low quality canned products and sell them for a premium. This place was just overall an awesome choice. Will definitely be back. 

You can get some really high quality wines here too. Like a wine snob heaven without the snobs. And mixing and matching bombers and bottles for beer is equally awesome for the beer connoisseurs!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner on a business trip. The ambiance is casual and perhaps somewhat trendy. The server was friendly and attentive, so full marks there. The menu had a great variety of appetizers and entrees, and the biggest disappointment for me was that I couldn't try more. I ended up getting the edamame, which was fairly standard, and the southern reuben which was basically a pulled pork sandwich with asparagus. The food was delicious. The asparagus was perfectly cooked. The pulled pork sandwich was maybe just a tad dry, and smaller than what I was expecting, but I was still full when I was done. I will be going back for lunch to test some other menu items as well. If you're looking for a slightly unique twist on food that doesn't come from a box or need to be unwrapped, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and always interesting. Service has been very hit-or-miss. Our first time there for brunch in the warmer weather was amazing, but now that seating has moved indoors, we have found the service lacking. Still delicious food and we leave happy, but they could use some work."}
{"text":"This is an example of what every town in America needs for a restaurant.  This casual restaurant located in downtown Belmont has traditional dishes and traditional dishes with some local flare.  The menu changes depending on the freshest ingredients available locally.  And when the weather is good, you can sit outside under the stars with live local music to add the perfect accompaniment to a great evening. Go there and don't be surprised if the Governor is eating at the table next to you!"}
{"text":"We're regulars but must confess their steaks are garbage. They flash grill them so they're burnt on the outside and dry on the inside. Not to mention overpriced. Steaks generally cost $30-50 as a meal and they just don't come out to the quality of the price they charge."}
{"text":"Southern Caesar Salad FTW. I had had a late lunch at work, so wasn't starving when I met up with friends one evening and opted for a salad. Most of my experiences with getting a salad topped with chicken it's either a chicken breast with a piece of lettuce or a salad with a chicken nugget. At the String Bean they nailed it with perfect portions of each. Also the jalapeño cornbread was really something else. Just enough spice to break a sweat, but not need a fire extinguisher.

Drink selection is always great with local brews on tap and bottled as well as craft beers from all over. Plenty of wines to choose from as well. They are usually very, VERY busy which is a testament to their quality. I believe almost everything is farm-to-table, organic, free-range/grass-fed, locally sourced and all that fun stuff. Also some gluten free options. Best advice is get there early or expect a 30-minute wait due to limited seating. Inside has bar seating, a few high tops, and tables, but there is also a patio with a number of tables as well. 

String Bean always a top option when swinging through Belmont!"}
{"text":"Called to get on call ahead seating and the girl said that the wait would be 20 min. She stated that by the time you get here there should  be a table. We arrived 20 minutes and checked in and then she said it's a 30 minute wait. The management need to train their staff to not lie to customers on the phone to draw them in and then to waste their time."}
{"text":"It's not bad, it's just... not as good as it wants to be. It wants to be a high-end establishment, but the last time I was there the menu was rife with greengrocer's apostrophes (pizza's, pasta's, fry's). It's hard to take a place seriously when the menu looks like it was written by a third grader. The food itself can be quite tasty, but this place seems to have inherent and habitual consistency issues. Food sometimes comes out of the kitchen whenever it's ready, which is fine if you're by yourself, but rude if others are still waiting on their dishes. Or perhaps the food will all come out at once, but a couple entrees will be stone cold. For what they charge, and the airs they put on, this is simply unacceptable."}
{"text":"3 and 1/2 stars, 2.5 for the food and one extra star for being a fun outdoor brunch destination  - on Saturdays not Sunday like Michael posted. 

Funky store, quality meats, Sushi grade tuna for only $14/lb, great wine selection reasonably priced, many beers etc. Tiny dining room but a great patio right in quaint downtown Belmont. That's where we sat to enjoy the weather.  

I didn't much care for the coffee but the food was alright, just not as good as it reads on the menu. 

Marinated eggplant grilled and served on Focaccia with feta cheese, pesto, lettuce and tomato. $10 with the duck fat fries option. The sandwich tastes great at first but the bread was totally soak in oil and pesto, so after a while I got tired of squirting oil all over me at every bite.

The duck fat fries were super crispy and addictive, but eat them while still hot as they get cold they definitely lose their charm. Well worth the $2 upgrade but a la carte they charge $9 for it which is simply bonkers. 

We also had a taco wrap of scrambled eggs, with applewood smoked bacon, avocado and cheese (I chose Feta) $9 I think. Pretty good but no wow. Honestly I'm not convinced that scrambled eggs and avocado are a winning combination but that's just me. The side was home fries, more like little cubes of potatoes, good as you can expect it to be. 

Altogether we ended up consuming way more salt that is necessary - or healthy for that matter - as it's too often the case.  

I won't mention the men's room (oops I just did) so there you have it, it's just a nice place to get out of town for the afternoon."}
{"text":"Three strikes resulting from one visit.  The first strike resulted from a two hour wait for an early Friday dinner.  TSB's on & off again reservation policy is ludicrous.  Strikes two and three resulted from food bought from their deli not being as fresh as it should have been:  the pork chops started turning brown the following day while it took two days for my digestive tract to recover from the crab cakes.  Memorable - but not the way you'd expect."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Belmont from Atlanta and this place definitely holds its own. I love the fact that I can order a flight of beer for $2!  And the food is wonderful. This place has a very unique concept and is definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"The Bean has been my go to spot since it opened. They do some things really well- wine, beer, pimento cheese-  I'm passionate about all these. Vegetarians beware: their soups, even when they sound like veggie soups, are usually chicken broth based. Huge disappointment because I love a good soup. Also, sometimes they make their hummus with meat. Bizarre. The good news is, they have one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had, and their specials are never disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, my fiancé and I are going through the wedding planner too.  Their food is good and they are very polite."}
{"text":"I used to love String Bean a couple of years ago, but recently the food hasn't impressed me. They have the best beer selection in town. However, because the food is pricey and nothing special, we usually buy beer from the market and head home."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, very laid back staff yet professional and very helpful. I love the overall attitude of the place. Some of the reviews said they try to be \"fine dining\" but that's far from the case. They do serve gourmet entrees of their own creation but doesn't mean they are anything more than what you get. Awesome food, awesome wine selection and a breath of fresh air in a small place like Belmont. Definitely one of my favorite choices for food!"}
{"text":"So fresh and everything is so yummy, especially the fried Oreos! Yum! If it's a Friday or Saturday, make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place.  We saw it on a list of restaurants on our hotel guide. But decided to eat here based on Yelp reviews.  You won't be disappointed.  The menu has a wide selection of entrées burgers and sandwiches and the price is great for what you get.  The place is small and can seem crowded but it's not bad at all."}
{"text":"We dined at this restaurant for the first time on Saturday afternoon for lunch.  The food was good, however the service was very, very slow (our server was Bo) and we were shocked when the bill arrived.  My husband ordered a chopped salad and added steak as a protein.  There were no prices for proteins on the menu, and \"Bo\" did not offer the price.  How in the world can they justify charging more for an added protein than they do for the salad?  $12 for 4 oz. filet on an $11 salad is beyond ridiculous.  It is not that we could not afford the add-on, it is the principal that if they are going to charge such an exorbitant price for such a small amount they should either disclose the cost on the menu or ensure their servers make patrons aware of the cost.    A steak salad at Longhorn Steakhouse is $14.99, or for $24.49 you can get an 8 oz fillet with a side item, salad and bread.  Do the math, folks, charging $23 for a salad and 4 oz of filet is a rip off.  We will not be back, two thumbs down String Bean."}
{"text":"String Bean is the \"best of Gaston\" which warrants only three stars.  We went for Saturday brunch.  Items look tasty but in true Gaston/Golden Corral fashion, everything was \"make your own\" or \"bottomless.\" Allow an addition 20 minutes for a dry omelette. Big Becky lived up to her name, but the biscuit was overcooked and dry.  They do not serve liquor so no Bloody Mary options.  Disgustingly,  they mix OMB beer with Bloody Mary mix.  This substitution is a disgrace to the beer and the Bloody Mary mix. 

Overall,  not a bad place for Belmont. However,  drive an extra 15 minutes to Dilworth/Southend for a much better brunch."}
{"text":"The food was OK. Wasn't seasoned very well. The presentation was none for my dish. I got the Southwestern chicken wrap. The fries were greasy and dark brown. I ate outside. Little cool that day. A few outside heaters would have been awesome. The inside was very nice,love the wine selection and fresh meats and fish area. Great location. I'm sure it will get better. May have been an off day. Lots of people here today. I will be back"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the wine selections, the meat case. Bo, our server was wonderful. The food was well prepared. Portions was good. Had a wonderful meal and will definitely return. The Sea Bass was pan seared and was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. Super friendly staff, great wine selections, and the food is surprisingly awesome!

During the summer, the patio is packed and for good reason. They usually will have live music out there too.

Has an on-site butcher although I've not taken advantage of that yet - so can't comment to the quality.

I recommend the Figgylicious pizza - that's my personal favorite. Goes great with the Double Decker Pinot Grigio."}
{"text":"I ALMOST CRIED over their food. Meaning I had the best chicken and dumplings of my life this night and I intentionally saved some for lunch the next day...and I left my to go box in the restaurant. Devastating. I went back but they were already thrown away. My fault I know! The dumplings were gnocchi and I can't stop telling everyone I know about this place! I'll definitely travel out of uptown to hit up Belmont just for this place!"}
{"text":"So. You know how I like to tell you what to do and what to order in my reviews? Well, this one is not any different. 

DUCK FAT FRIES. 

No, typing this in all upper case is not exaggerating. I know that everyone else has written this as well, believe us - order them. They are amazing. And I'll be the first to admit, I'm a little picky and sometimes turn my nose up at new things - but I put my trust in my fantastic server, Jennifer, and my fellow yelpers. They are wonderful, crispy, & delicious. They're like regular french fries and crack had a baby, and now this is the only kind of french fry that I want to eat. (Note: I do not suggest actual crack, lets keep it PG & safe over here friends.) Duck fat fries ruined regular fries for me, and I never want to go back. And apparently duck fat is better for you than vegetable oil? I'll believe that, because I'm blinded by love. 

Next. After you've secured your fries order - I ordered the Italian Monk. It was really good. It looks kind of basic when it comes out, but its packed with perfect flavor pairings. I also recommend this. :)

The feel of this place is awesome, the people are friendly and welcoming - and its like 1/3 bottle shop (with \"mystery\" bags! What!? I LOVE mysteries!), 1/3 restaurant & 1/3 butcher/seafood counter. Three of my favorite things! I noticed a little coffee section too, but didn't peruse over that way. Also, if it's nice out, check out that gorgeous patio. Like something out of a whimsy romantic comedy, I loved it. Oh, AND they were voted for The Best Place to Bring a Date in Gaston County 2016. So, let me take this time to remind you, handsome, single Yelpers - I am also single, and I really like bottle shop/restaurant/whimsy patios. #shamelessplug

In conclusion, go here - bring another cool yelper, sit on the patio, order duck fat fries, and consider the Italian Monk."}
{"text":"This place rips off catering customer by trying to charge them for way more then they order, don't try talking to owner Chad he is very unprofessional, rude, curses you, and hangs up on you when asking about the bill they will charge your card even prior to you receiving a invoice. So advice to you hire a cater that cares not this dump and the pork was extremely dry."}
{"text":"Fantastic shrimp and grits! Great craft beers and a friendly staff. This place was excellent and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place came recommended by a local and I am so glad.  They were packed. They only had 2 seats opened at the bar, and one of those was just leaving.  I was welcomed as soon as I sat down.  Got my drink immediately.  The server even took time to make recommendations and the food was out in a more than reasonable time and cooked to perfection.  They must have 200 different types of beers that you can't find everyday.  I guarantee they have at least one you will like and haven't tried before.  You MUST stop in."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is superb.  The bison burger and fig/goat cheese/flatbread are favorites.  They tend to take a little longer than I think is appropriate for what is being served but it's not ridiculous.  One of the best places to eat in Belmont and surrounding cities."}
{"text":"I got the Gorgonzola and pear salad. I would try something else next time. I had a grilled chicken and it came as grilled chicken tenderloins which are not my favorite because of the tendon that runs through the middle of them. The salad itself was too sweet because of those sweet pears and candied walnuts and sweet dressing. There wasn't enough Gorgonzola to counterbalance and it was overly sweet.
I go back but try something different."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant out and was sadly disappointed.  Waffles were rubbery.  Not sure if I'll come back.  Service wasn't great either"}
{"text":"I went here last night for a birthday dinner with a group of 12 people. Be prepared to be PATIENT. The food was amazing. The service was not. First, we ordered apps. A friend of mine ordered bison quesadillas and we were told they were out of bison. So she ordered the Boom Boom Shrimp instead. After a while, apps come out and she's given the Bison quesadilla. Great! But then the shrimp comes, and she asks if she will be charged for both and they said yes and said we didn't have to take the shrimp- it was awkward. Anyway, she decided to take both and they were both delicious. As were the duck fat fries! Amazing! Finally it comes time to order entrees. About 20min after ordering, we were told they were out of the Chicken & Dumpling Gnocchi which 2 people had ordered. Disappointing. They ordered other things that they weren't as excited about. I myself got the Shrimp & Grits and they were cheesy and delicious. The sole reason for the 3 stars is the service. We had to wait forever on drinks throughout the night, the availability of the food was shaky and not communicated well. But again, the food was incredible."}
{"text":"The sandwich was really good... I just didn't love the place so much. My server was great also. From the name I just kind of expected a healthier place."}
{"text":"Visiting the area for 2 weeks we were intrigued with the interesting restaurants in Belmont.  Based on the rave reviews we ordered the Big Green Monster/fried green tomatoes and the Duck Fat Fries.  We were not disappointed.  These items were over the top amazing!  Also ordered the Bison Quesidilla, which was just ok.  It was hard to eat since it was chock full of corn, black beans and chopped tomato... but lacking cheese or something to hold it together on a fork.  The portions were generous and interesting flavors.  We had plenty leftovers to take home.  I admit the fries ARE addictive and were just as good hours later and the next day cold.  They remained crisp and definitely not greasy. Just WOW.

Actually they were so addictive we came back 5 days later just for a rerun on the Duck Fat Fries and fried green tomato.  Sadly, we should have just remembered the previous good meal and moved on.  The fries were NOT the same.  they were rubbery, chewy and greasy.  When we asked the server if they also served regular fries, thinking maybe we got the wrong order, she insisted that these were the Duck Fat Fries.  hmmmm.  So I guess you have a 50/50 chance of a great fries experience -- or maybe she was mistaken.
Overall the food was good but both times service was lacking.  We went around 2:30, when it was not crowded. There seemed to be plenty of staff.  But neither waitress was friendly, service oriented or attentive.  Example --we ordered sweet tea, the first time we got no refill, and the second time after requesting a refill she eventually came, poured unsweetened, and disappeared for so long that it wasn't worth requesting a new glass.  We were seated outside in the lovely garden area, where there were only 3 tables seated. There were other employees/waitress and hostess working inside, so I'm not sure why our server was so hard to find.  She knew we ordered the tomatoes and fries to share, but she never brought an additional plate.  It was awkward to both eat off the same plate, considering the saucy dish and high top table.

Bottom line, I'm glad we tried it and experienced the memorable fries, but they are not consistent and the service needs improvement."}
{"text":"I've eaten here probably ten times and LOVE it. Sometimes they're out of my favorite beer because other people also acknowledge it's delicious and order it. Sometimes when I sit outside in the middle of the day in the summertime I notice that the sun is hot. One time I tried something new and it wasn't my favorite meal of all time. However, this place is clutch and none of that has to do with whether or not this is a great place worth visiting (on the reg). Their food is creative and delicious but still full of familiar and hearty flavors. The local sourcing is fantastic, and I've had in depth conversations with staff about where their meats and seafood are sourced. They're proud of their product, kind, and laugh at my shitty jokes. Also their eggplant fries are more important to me and relevant than the presidential election. I will admit their new bahn mi steamed bun is definitively not bahn mi or a steamed bun nor does it contain actual kimchi. But it still tastes good so whatever. This place is da bomb and I'm proud to have it in Belmont and show it off to anyone that visits."}
{"text":"I have never not left a tip or been tempted to walk out on my check more than I was at The String Bean.  The food was good, but the service left a bad taste in my mouth. We had a large party of 7 so they sat us in the market which was not problem, however, the table was not ready when we arrived 10mins after our reservation. Three different people came to take our drink order which arrived after 10mins. I order ice water and received ice in my drink at the very beginning but then after having to request more water multiple times water that was poured was lukewarm with no ice. Several of us ordered bottled drinks but were not given cups. When the food came 30mins later two of our party were missing food, one a burger and the other a plate for the buffet. Four different staff members were made aware of this and 10mins had gone by before our waitress confessed that she had not put the burger in and then hurried to get a plate for the buffet (which had been asked for 4 times). We had to go up and ask for salt and pepper from the work counter. The burger was delivered and the food was great overall. I had to ask for a clean buffet plate to return for seconds and was told to just take the dirty place back up there. When I said I would rather not to the 5th staff member that I had seen and flagged down he said there were plates on the buffet and then later came back with a plate because that turned out not to be true. We had told the servers that it was our friends birthday and were never offered dessert. The manager did go the extra mile to get a label off a beer bottle for the birthday girl which was appreciated. Following the meal we waited for the check for over 30mins and then the waitress had to come through and ask each one of us what we ordered again in order to separate the check. By this time we were missing the fireworks outside and all the street festivities. They offered for us to go outside and then come back in to receive the check but we said we would like to walk around too and waited another 10mins. Finally we got up and walked outside on the patio to see what was left of the fireworks where we saw the manager and owner watching the fireworks rather than getting our checks. Needless to say I was furious. When I saw the checks the burger was not complementary (after waiting 15 mins for it after everyone else got their meal) but was discounted a couple of dollars. The manager made little to no apologies until I spoke to him about the services and said that I was understanding, but a discount would have been the right course of action to soften the blow of the piss poor service. The manager just said thanks for the feedback and did nothing to correct the situation. Later while standing outside (waiting for the other checks) two of the chiefs approached us and to ask us about the food and were told about the service and apologized. One of the chiefs looked to talk to the owner about the situation but the owner never approached us to apologize or discount our next meal there in an effort to encourage us to come back. The checks were never brought to two of our party who ended up leaving without paying out of frustration (which I would never agree with however it this situation there is only so much you can do).
I have worked in the restaurant industry before and understand new trainees and being busy and forgetting to put in orders, but what I cannot understand is not apologizing for the poor services without being prompted and then not providing adequate discounts as a gesture of remorse and good will.  The burger should have been complementary and all the check at least 5 to 10% off for the service and the wait and the owner should have come to us directly to apologize. I will not be returning although the food is good, it is not good enough to be treated in such a way. 
My suggests to those who would like to try the String Bean is don't bring over four people because they seem to not be able to handle it or make up for it."}
{"text":"I came on a Wednesday evening and was surprised to find a 25min wait, this place is popular in Belmont! While I waited I browsed the meat counter and shelves of wine and beer. I noticed that the drinks in the \"grocery\" were marked up but you could open and enjoy there while you waited...paying for convenience I guess. Menu had a good variety of food and different serving sizes. The Sting Bean likes to boast fresh, local meat/fish. 

My date and I split the duck fat fries, SO YUMMY! I had the seared tuna/yellow tail salad and my boyfriend enjoyed the steak burger with a side Caesar salad. The server was very friendly and helpful (brought us tastings of beer as we decided on drinks) but became a little forgetful towards the end of the meal. Two separate servers asked if I would like to try the ginger dressing along with the wasabi dressing that was served with my salad. Neither girl returned with the dressing. At the end of the meal our server clarified that they were out of ginger dressing which is why she never returned with it. Oh. 

If work brings me back to Kings Mountain, NC, I will definitely be back to The String Bean...but may make reservations first."}
{"text":"Easy coast, west coast...it doesn't matter! Both oysters were to die for.  I highly recommend the pecan encrusted trout with the house made honey mustard sauce; easy to pair with their fabulous wine list.  I know it sounds basic but the kids PB&J was off the charts on their fresh bread and legit jam.  This is a great NC experience."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch! And service, fresh, flavorful and tons of great choices... Can't wait till next visit to try more, whatever you get, make sure to add duck fat fries!"}
{"text":"Fabulous for the beer selection alone. In a craft beer wasteland of Walmart, Food Dog and Bi-Lo in Belmont this place is great to have around. 

The prices are a little higher than you would find elsewhere but we don't mind paying a little more to support a local business. 

I have only eaten here a couple times so far. Both times were great. The burger and sweet potato fries are very tasty. Definitely a welcome gourmet vibe in this small town. They always have delicious and innovative sounding specials. Also a cheese and meat counter on-site.

I would definitely recommend checking this place out, especially if you are into good beer."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time here. Customer service is horrendous. When they make a mistake, they become indigent and refuse to make it right, or even apologize. We will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but nothing wonderfully outstanding. Good clean restaurant. Service was quick and good, and the prices were comparable to other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and great food. I had the live fit wrap and my wife the salmon tacos. Our waitress Bonita fantastic!"}
{"text":"Fantastic find. When you walk in the front door the butcher case greets you. That set the bar pretty high as everything in the case looked great. We were seated promptly by the gentleman who came from behind the case. Our waitress Bonita and waitress in training Carli were not only friendly but informative. We had quite a few questions, as we usually do and the staff didn't mind at all. I wanted a burger that wasn't on the menu. Not a problem. I got exactly what I wanted done to a perfect medium. We had the eggrolls for an appetizer, they were ridiculously good. By the time we left at about 12:45 the line was out the door. Its no wonder, if I lived nearby I'd be a regular in no time. Oh and don't miss the duck fat fries."}
{"text":"I love the string bean! Great atmosphere, great food, great servers, all around is one of my favorite restaurants here. I'm a local In Belmont and it's always a treat to go to string bean. Especially if you get the fried Oreos :) 
I will say if you decide to go on a weekend in the evening make a reservation. It's not very big so it's a smart thing to do!"}
{"text":"Not that the food was bad. It always satisfies, but food isn't everything. When I paid $16 for a lunch consisting of sautéed vegetables and grits, I  told the management that was outrageously priced.  The front of house manager was a total jerk and said that this is a normal price for a vegan meal and made no effort to appease my complaint.
  It simply isn't a good price for greasy slimy vegetables. And as someone who enjoys gourmet food, even if you get the highest quality grits, they don't run over $3/lbs!
 I refuse to eat here again, which sucks because they are the only decent place to eat in Belmont. I guess that's why they think they can charge whatever they want."}
{"text":"Only 25 minutes from our place Uptown - love The String Bean in Belmont!!  Great patio area and nice interior.  It has a butcher counter, hard to find beer and wines as well as a full restaurant and bar. 

Fun table in the back inside with the beer for you to settle with your friends like you are at Mom's kitchen table....except surrounded by great beer!!!

The staff was awesome when we went.  I had the tuna salad, very simple and delicious.  Served with a wasabi dressing.  Would definitely get it again!!!  Can't wait to go back!  :-D"}
{"text":"Giving a fair review isn't always easy. When The String Bean has all cylinders firing it is hard to beat. If you can get past the aloof hostess staff you are halfway there, and I'd easily give TSB a 5-Star rating if this area of the restaurant experience was improved. Sadly it's the one part of the checklist that gets the lowest marks. The food is great, but our family has to weigh the balance of whether we want to be treated like an afterthought just to eat a meal. It isn't just a meal and that's what makes it so difficult. The hostesses set the tempo when you walk in the door, and I usually have to ignore their lack of hospitality because I know \"The Big Green Monster\", (fried green tomatoes with a sauce you'll want to bathe in), and \"Anything For Love\", (an elevated version of mother's meatloaf and mashed potatoes), is worth the slight irritation caused by youth who need more 'seasoning'. When there's a wait to be seated, you can peruse the Wine Spectator award-winning selection lining the walls and shelves, along with the ReWined line of candles whose lovely fragrance medicates the sting of icy hostesses. There's a butcher case with fresh seafood and meats that'll have you eeney-meeny-miney-mo'ing your way to the table for a cooked-to-order bit of satisfaction.  While it usually isn't a flawless visit...predominantly because the hostesses act like you are lucky they are speaking to you...the food is well prepared and delicious, the atmosphere is abuzz with great music and the best al fresco dining in Gaston County.  The location, in the heart of charming Belmont, makes it a perfect choice to walk off any amount of indulgence by window shopping or hitting the other local bars down the block."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of The String Bean. It's a great place if you're in the mood to take a drive (or lucky you if you live close by). We've taken family from out of town, who doesn't love visiting a quaint NC town? You can have lunch on the patio, take a stroll after, maybe visit an antique store...

And they have a great menu - salads, sammies, burgers - everything I've seen looks great. I tried the bison burger last time and it was perfectly cooked and delish. I love how they have wine and beer \"to go\" plus a butcher and fresh seafood. You can go for lunch and bring something home for dinner! The servers also bring their NC hospitality, everyone there is super friendly. 

I saw they are starting brunch mid-April - with live jazz! I may have to drive back to Belmont to check that out. String Bean, can you please just open a location closer to home? Downtown Matthews would be great!"}
{"text":"I'll definitely be back.  Staying in area overnight to catch the first morning flight out at CLT.  Super friendly people.  Very accommodating.   Food diversified and tastes great.  Nice to be stuck over night and not have to eat at a chain restaurant.  Great list of micro brews and diversified wine.  No grocery store wine.  YEA! Great prices.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Lamb chops as an appetizer.  Gotta love that.  Served with southern pickled(?), spicy collard greens.  Salmon was good.  I'll be back for a rib eye steak next, carved right off the side of beef.  REALLY?  Doesn't get any fresher than that in a restaurant.  If you're local, they have butcher, deli, wine and beer shop all in one.  Can they open one of these in Corona (like the beer), CA?"}
{"text":"I probably need to update my String Bean review - mostly because I really like them but also because they're going to open one in Shelby!!Yay!

When Nellie's was packed and overwhelmed and staff looked confused, String Bean kept their composure and seated us right away. And although the patio is hotter than heck, that's unfortunately outdoor dining in NC. Still hoping they get some outdoor fans!!

I polished off an entire bowl of Edamame by myself - love that stuff! I always order the Green Monster - they can really cook a Fried Green Tomato here.

For main course we had a Tuna steak (rare - market price) with aside of twice baked potato and asparagus.  The tuna was a nice sized portion, cooked perfectly and had that nice mild but substantial meaty flavor rare tuna has. My mother had the Angry Cow Pig Burger with ground jalapenos and ghost pepper cheese - I did have some meal envy but did get a couple of bites.  Just enough heat to follow the bite from start to finish without \"spiking\" and making it too hot to eat. BTW - I am now in love with eggplant fries (or at least theirs) I would expect eggplant fries to be a greasy and limp product - these were nothing like that - delicious and addictive.

And we can't forget the incredible beer selection they have. Mmmm Triple C 3C IPA......

Thanks for having my back String Bean! I got yours!"}
{"text":"We tried The String Bean after a visit to the Daniel Stowe Botanical Garden. We were nothing but impressed. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the ambiance feels like, well, home. Aside from the restaurant, the String Bean has a great little market with beer and wines, and a butcher shop. 

We both we starving, and we were given some favorites by our waitress. We shared the Italian Monk Sandwich and the BBQ, both with the duck fat fries. Both were absolutely fantastic. We will be making the string bean a stop if we are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Love it. I've never been disappointed here. Try anything, you'll love it!
The salads and sandwiches are spot on. Eating outside when tne weather is nice is a bonus."}
{"text":"String bean had a great selection of beers and wine. My friends and I got 9 appetizers to split between the 4 of us so that we could try them all out. I recommends the BBQ eggrolls, fig flatbread, duck fat fries, and bison quesadilla. I was a huge fan of the pimento cheese dip. Definitely a good place to try out."}
{"text":"What a great little place.  We visited for a Saturday lunch and arrived at 1:30 ish and the place was still packed.  That is a good sign, my friend.  The outdoor patio wasn't being used at all and honestly, the dining area is pretty small, so it would've been nice to use it but it was still too hot.  I would love to come back on a more comfortable weather day and spend some time on the patio.

The food I had was great, I stuck with a salad, nothing too special but delicious none the less.  This place is a cool concept.  Basically, craft beer and wine for sale, along side fresh cut meats and fish for the taking.  They have an awesome bottled beer line up but the draft side of the house is a little lacking.

Parking is street side mostly as I could tell and I imagine that parking becomes hard to find during peak hours."}
{"text":"Service can be hit or miss, but the food is usually pretty good.  Save room for the fried Oreos; it's so good! They also have a great beer and wine pick & go selection. You can spend an hour or two just looking through all of them."}
{"text":"I've been here four times now. My last two times put the nail in the coffin. It was our choice to wait 25 minutes for a table. Assuming we must have not ordered the right thing last time, since it was so crowded, we gambled on it again. It was crowded to the point of frustration, since they had single restrooms, the men's room line was five deep. Last time we went, the waiter failed to tell us about the specials. My husband would have gotten the special. Good news, though, they had the same special on this visit. Did I mention that once we were seated, we waited 55 minutes to get served? For a sandwich, a salad, and a kids meal??!! Husband got his soft shell crab sandwich and reported that it had no flavor whatsoever. It was bread with something bready between and no other flavors. He ordered it exactly how they suggested. His fries were stone cold. My Southern Caesar salad had a sliver of cornbread with it. A sliver. And I had to request some additional dressing because it was so dry. The music was insanely loud for such a small crowded space. We spent $50 for appetizer, sandwich, salad and kids meal. I feel robbed. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Amazingly cold dining room. Hostesses are dressed like they are homeless. String decor in frames are covered in dirt. Too bad because food was good."}
{"text":"Reviews about poor  service are spot on. They totally forgot a beer request my friend asked for with his meal while I enjoyed a Beck's non-alcoholic only to be told they only had that one bottle. Food, eh, what can I say positive...nothing. Men's bathroom was filthy, floor was so bad it was sticky."}
{"text":"Great wine and beer list for this small neighborhood restaurant! The highlight is ordering your protein from the butcher case and letting the chef get creative with your meal!  If you don't leave room for the fried Oreos and ice cream, share a little with your friends!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here - great menu - everything Hong is fresh and locally sourced! I was also impressed at the neat market, wine and beer store!"}
{"text":"I travel to the Charlotte area for work and I always go to this place. They have an excellent menu.

If you're looking for any type of meat or seafood they likely have it (within reason.) I highly recommend their bison quesadilla for an appetizer, it can be shared 4 ways. The Sourhern Rueben is delicious as is their pork belly sliders (can't remember the actual menu name.)

They also have a good beer and wine selection. 

I highly recommend you go here if you're in the Belmont area!"}
{"text":"First time here. Fairly small dining area and I noticed people lingering and not really eating, more socializing. Which is fine if you have the room, this place doesn't if they're trying to increase food sales. Started with the shrimp and although they were definitely spicy, taste was spectacular. We each had the burgers, my burger was tasty but bun seem to crumbly. Wife and daughter had no complaints. When it comes to food, I look at it as more than an energy source which is why I'm more critical.  The meat selection on display was enough to entice me back for another go. Service was friendly and accurate on the order, I just found a couple of them to seem a little \"rough\", more in line with an Applebee's or similar type of place. Very nice wine/beer selection, one of the best I've seen for its size."}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago with my husband and son. We had heard good things and saw good reviews so we were excited to go. I was disappointed in the menu selections, I thought there would be more variety or more gourmet food. I ordered a burger (well done bc I'm pregnant) and it came out crispy burnt on the outside. My son ordered the kids jumbo grilled shrimp, which was not that jumbo for 2 of them and they brought out fried at first do he had to wait to get the grilled. My husband had Pizza which was just average. We tried to use a \"Go Play Save\" coupon, but they said that they had a sign by the register that says they don't accept these because the book put them in without their permission. That makes them look bad more than the book. The book is for charity, I actually purchased this one for my son's elementary school. The restaurant gets free advertising being in it (free bc they aren't giving away free food) and people may even order more than they would have using the coupon. The waiter would still get the same amount of tip. The waiter came to tell us about this, which I think should've been the job of a manager instead. The whole night left us with a bad first impression and we don't plan to go back. It's too bad because my husband also works nearby and frequently takes interview candidates and clients out to eat, but won't be going here. So they really lost out more than the $10 in free food they would've given us by honoring the coupon."}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience at the String bean today. It's located in a very quaint district in Belmont North Carolina. It feels very warm and cozy in the restaurant and the staff is very friendly. I ordered a black bean burger wrap with the house cut fries. It was absolutely delicious! I would suggest ordering a side of their ranch dip that comes with their burgers to go along with it it was absolutely yummy! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nice selection of food items , prepared relatively quickly and delivered hot. 

Fried green tomatoes!! 
Sweet potato fries all nice and crisp.

Nice selection of craft beer here too. Atmosphere is fun and always lively.
They went out of their way to assure me a table on a busy Saturday night when our arrival time traveling was delayed."}
{"text":"First time visit and was truly impressed. This spot is the historic area of downtown Belmont. They have quite an impressive selection of craft beers, wine and cocktails. I had a Cuban Sandwich with Eggplant fries and the twist on this classic sandwich was nice but the Eggplant fries had me wanting more. My Wife had a Crabcake Sandwich with Duck Fries and they were light with a nice crispness to them. My Wife had a cider beer as I went with a local one. Our server was knowledgable about everything on the menu so we will be back again."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting the String Bean for about 8 months now and it's time I proclaimed my love via Yelp: 5 STARS!

Everything I've tried at this place is great - between the local menu, daily specials, and great beer selection (both bottled and on tap), this place has it all. Not to mention a beautiful outdoor seating area with outdoor fireplaces roaring in the fall and winter and live bands in the spring and summer.

I live a good 30 minutes away but never mind making the drive to this place. Parking is a breeze, prices are a steal for the quality, and the staff is top notch in terms of friendliness and attentiveness.

Do yourself (and your taste buds!) a favor and check out The String Bean with friends, a date, your parents or even solo ~ you're bound to make a friend or two at this place!"}
{"text":"Great concept!  The food is great, the meats behind the butcher counter are great too to take home and throw on the grill!  The puppies love their bone treats they had one night as well!  Something for everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing wine selection, amazing beer selection.  Ate there last night outside, marvelous evening."}
{"text":"Decided to come here since it was close to my favorite antique shop in Belmont. Came here on a Friday for lunch and the parking lot was full. Cute place with lots of options of beer. Portions here are huge so I would recommend sharing if possible. Started with a cup of coffee. Coffee here is not good. Very bitter tasting. Skip it. My wife had the Reuben sandwich with house-made potato chips. The corned beef was on the dry and salty side. Rye bread could've been softer. I wish the house made chips were made to order but good nonetheless. I had the special of the day which is a fried catfish po boy. It was delicious! Lightly fried on the outside and tender on the inside. Sauce was so good! I wish there was more. Got it with fried eggplant fries. It was a first for me and I enjoyed them. Overall, it was good and I want to try different things."}
{"text":"I've stopped by this place numerous times over the years and have always been pleased with the food, which is consistently good. My problem is the service.  I don't require much, maybe the ability to put my order in and a refill or two on water and I'm happy. Only time I've had acceptable service here is while sitting at the bar.  It doesn't seem like anyone here has much of a sense of urgency. I stopped in Friday night around 6:30pm and was promptly sat, then waited at least 10 mins possibly more like 15 without a server coming to take our order. I had enough, got up and walked out and to Glenway pub."}
{"text":"Don't come here when it's busy. Hostesses are rude. Tried to get take out, and it was a nightmare. Sad because the food is actually really good. It's not worth bad service. Your hostess with a bad attitude ruined the experience."}
{"text":"Another stop when I was in ATL was this shop. It was a great visit, with friendly and helpful staff. I wished I'd have been in town longer so I could go back to try a few other things on the menu. 
It has indoor and outdoor seating and isn't just a restaurant - there's a wine shop and butchery included. Pretty cool combination!

They have 7 rotating draft taps, and a LONG beer and wine list.

Catfish bites, eggplant fries and the dry Filet were the standouts for me this trip."}
{"text":"This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a loooong time. I was going to the Daniel Stowe Garden and wanted to try a different lunch place than I usually frequent. I'm SO glad I did! As if the fresh, incredibly delicious food weren't enough of the draw, it's well priced and the staff is incredibly efficient and friendly. It's always nice to see a restaurant that hires enough waiters to handle the crowds. Everybody I talked to -- from the hostess to my waiter to the kid bussing tables -- was so polite and friendly. Best of all, they seemed to genuinely like working there. I will be back A LOT."}
{"text":"We stopped into The String Bean for a late lunch on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  The restaurant was very busy, but we were more than happy to wait the half hour it took to get a seat outside on their patio.

Our first impression was not completely pleasant.  The table they brought us to had been cleared of dishes, but not wiped clean so there were quite a few crumbs remaining.  There were also several celery sticks on the ground beneath the table that an overly enthusiastic toddler must have thrown that were not picked up either.  Undaunted and hungry, we soldiered on and ordered the Big Green Monster to start, described as such: \"Hand breaded green tomato slices fried to perfection and stacked high with layers of pepperjack cheese and finished with chipotle ranch drizzle. Served with our homemade pimento cheese, just because we like it\"

We asked for the chipotle ranch on the side, which they honored.  The starter itself was four smallish slices of green tomato, fried and stacked one on top of the other with small pieces of pepper jack in between.  My first thought was that at $9, this was overpriced by at least $2 for the amount of food they give you.  We crushed it in a matter of minutes.  While tasty with the pimiento cheese and chipotle ranch, the breading on the tomatoes was dying for some salt.

For my lunch, I ordered The Big Abbey, a 10 oz. burger with cheddar, coleslaw, lettuce, tomato, and a fried pickle slice, with their potato salad as my side.  The trouble began when I cut the burger in half and saw that the patty had not been cooked to my requested medium - it was a solid, uniformly grey color, completely well-done.  It took a while for our burgers to come out (my wife also got a burger, also asked for medium, and it was also cooked completely through), and we were really hungry, so we didn't say anything and just ate them as-is.  It really ruined the experience.  The meat was dry and chewy, and while the burger itself was constructed well, the seasoning seemed a bit off.  I don't know what else they use aside from salt on the beef, but it had a bit of a meatloaf-y vibe to it, which wasn't terribly pleasant especially with the way it was overcooked.  The potato salad on the side was tasty.

Service was really slow, even though the place had really slowed down after we were sat.  Our server made just a few cameo appearances and we had to ask the hostess to wave him down to bring our check and a to-go box to us, which I ended up grabbing myself anyway when I went inside in a futile attempt to wash my hands as the men's room was out of order.

All in all, this was a disappointing experience, deserving of no more than two stars.  I threw in an extra star for the incredible selection of beer and wine they have.  Whoever manages their offerings of that sort knows what they're doing and really has an eye for the good stuff.  I didn't buy anything to take with me, but it's good to know I have access to such a selection only a short drive away.

This is the second time we've been here, and we had the exact same issues the first time (same overcooked burger and even the same server).  I doubt we'll be back for another sit-down meal."}
{"text":"Amazing... Great find! Wine and beer selection out of this world with the butcher on site- our new favorite place! My husband had the pork loin special and I had the yellowfin salad- both delicious not to mention the butcher block meat and cheese tray was fantastic! Will be back!"}
{"text":"In town from Baltimore and came for brunch. It's a great spot for outdoor eating, bottomless mimosas and live music. Everyone loved their meal and the service was great. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nice place, great service.  I've been there numerous times & the menu is a 50/50 hit & miss.  It has an impressive take home section...fresh seafood, steak, deli meat, wine...very, very nice!  Parking can be challenging, permit a little extra time.  Gorgeous, safe neighborhood, inside/outside dining, nice beer & wine choices.  No cocktails."}
{"text":"What a great place, a market with beautiful fish, meat, huge wine and beer selection.  Grabbed takeout- go for the duck fries! The fried green tomato on the BLT was a great edition. Great atmosphere. Would definitely try again."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful and fresh. Wine selection was awesome.  Really enjoyed to farm-to-table type vibe and the quirky atmosphere. The fried pickle chips are enormous. I tried the caprese panini with chicken. Delish!"}
{"text":"I have been to the String Bean a few times now. The first time I went I got their Cowpig burger. I'm not a fan of raw bacon cooked into burger because it cooks unevenly. Wasn't impressed. The second time I came I had the Cuban sandwich and I loved it. The third time I got the roast beef sandwich and it was a little dry, but my mom got the portobello sandwich and it was delicious. It looks like its either hit or miss with the menu items, but it is nice to find a place that tries to do something new and interesting. I love the coleslaw and the homemade chips. The beer selection is pretty impressive too. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff, great beer selection. I haven't had anything on the menu that I didn't love.  By far my favorite place to eat and grab a drink in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"The taste of the food is mouth watering and delicious. The Catawba Cobb salad had everything that I love in a salad! Just one complaint, the meat was over cooked so we sent it back. But they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"Not impressed in the least....lackadaisical attitude doesn't work for me....you're in the service industry...if you don't like waiting on people find something else to do...can't comment on the food as getting \"a\" beer was a sojourn..."}
{"text":"Food: I ordered The Cure from the Brunch menu. My wife ordered the Big Becky. Fantastic. 

Service: Super helpful. Seemed to love working there.

Atmosphere: Nice patio, relaxing.

Price: Prices were much lower than I expected."}
{"text":"Best beer selection in Belmont, in my opinion. The food is great too but the beer is what sets this place apart. Every time I go here I put forward a conscious effort to try a different beer. 

The service is great as well. The servers have a great sense of humor and know a bit about the food and beers. 

The food is great to go along with their beer or wine choices (they have a good selection of wine too, but I am a beer person most of the time). You must try a flat bread when you are there or a bison burger. Oh and who can forget the fried pickles as an app."}
{"text":"This place could be excellent but they fail in the small details. First off the staff is not very friendly and we had a bad waitress, very impatient. The food is good but it is hard to lay out good money for an attitude when there is three more great places to eat in Belmont ."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and they were packed. The restaurant isn't big so it was very crowded at the bar area. We ended up sitting outside and really enjoyed it. 

We started off with the pimento cheese dip and we were all highly pleased. They have a good selection on their menu and it was hard to choose from. I ended up getting the Angry Cow Pig burger. It comes with jalapenos and onions topped with a ghost pepper cheese. Burger was large and juicy. Everyone at our table got burgers and we were all loving it. 

Service was a little slow I guess due to it being a saturday night but our drinks were practically empty. We hardly saw our server. We actually had to stop him and ask him for more beers. We would definitely come back though."}
{"text":"Looking for a place in Belmont for dinner last night an found this place on Yelp. The food was amazing we first ordered the fried pickles wow. They are the big dill pickles cut an breaded than fried it comes with a spicy sauce but I like fried pickles with ranch you know it's the southern gravy lol I ordered the Reuben it was almost like shaved corn beef with sauerkraut on a thick cut of I think sour dough marble bread an a side of thousand island. I didn't want a regular side of fries I ordered the egg plant fries wow they were awesome . My friend ordered the caprese sandwich it was like a panini with sweet potato fries. We topped that off with fried Oreos with ice cream that should be against the law lol they were so good I'll b back for sure next time. I have to say the service could have been better I don't know if they were short on wait staff but anyway I'll b back an if you go you gotta get the fried Oreos"}
{"text":"I would rate String Bean 5 stars but can't bring myself to do it because I think that should really be reserved for that elusive experience at some amazing location on a trip to some faraway land on the perfect day that probably is something made up in my mind.
Now to String Bean..I LOVE this place! The meat is fantastic quality and everything is so fresh and prepared simply but somehow just tastes amazing.
The wine is what gets me. Nothing like grabbing a great bottle of wine off the shelf and have it with dinner and pay 1/3 or less of what you would pay at any other restaurant.
Tonight we decided on an early dinner and I was in need of a good steak. I decided on the special. A ribeye with bacon jam, smashed goat cheese potatoes and collards.
I was hesitant about bacon jam. I'm usually a steak purist. A Good cut of meat doesn't need junk on it but I trusted them on the bacon jam because these guys are serious about their meat...and all I can say is DAMN! That stuff is awesome! I wanted a big jar of that bacon jam to take home. 
The service was spot on, the wine service was great as always (I grabbed an inexpensive bottle of 1919 Malbec off the shelf for $12) and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the tuna special.
I'll keep going back over and over to The String Bean. This place is great for a quick burger at lunch, a dinner date, or just chilling on the patio next to the outdoor fireplace with friends and a bottle of wine.
I give them two enthusiastic thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"They underestimated the wait time and then made the excuses which were lame.  The food was adequate, not outstanding. The atmosphere is loud and the service was ok.  Overall I would go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend and there was definitely a wait, so we went to have a drink at Nellie's. But since we've heard good things about The String Bean, we'd wait it out. This was definitely not the atmosphere I initially thought. Not your typical restaurant vibe as it's mostly high top tables next to a butcher service and small bodega-style market. To the food, our table split the fried green tomatoes which were excellent as the tomatoes were cut thickly and fried perfectly with the right amount of batter and dressing. I had the Southern Reuben which has pulled pork instead of corned beef. Very tasty and not overpriced.

Set your expectations here as it's not fine dining and plan accordingly for a wait in the winter as there's not much seating inside."}
{"text":"This place is never open when it says...and if you are so lucky for them to be open during posted times...often no one around to help you. A complete waste of time to go here, service terrible."}
{"text":"Good food. HORRIBLE service! We were a larger party, so they sat us at the little craft table or whatever it was in the market. That's fine. We wanted dinner, so we were okay with that.

What wasn't fine was they didn't even clear it off. They left a price gun and a bunch of paperwork on the table. Strike one.

We have three different people approach us in the time we placed a drink order, and received our drinks. One member of our party ordered a beer on draft, and they brought him a bottle. I ordered a diet coke, and they brought me a canned diet coke. Not in the mood to pay for multiple cokes, I switched and ordered sweet tea. 

After waiting FOREVER to get our drinks, we had a different person approach us to take our orders. This time it was a woman, and she did a great job of explaining the specials to us, but when I said I'd like one of them, she told me they were out of it. Okay, so why bother telling me about it? Strike two.

Some of us ordered appetizers, and about twenty minutes after we ordered them they arrived. My husband and I had the hummus, and it was delicious. What wasn't awesome is that they give you a decent sized bowl of hummus and like 6 small wedges of pita bread to dip in it. I guess we were supposed to scoop the rest out and eat it with a spoon. 

Anyways. About 45 minutes AFTER our appetizers, we finally received our meals. Everything was fantastic. I had a delicious mediterranean pizza and my husband's steak was delicious. 

But this is the part that outraged me. Our waitress was God awful at filling our drinks. Two of us had sweet tea. We asked FOUR times for refills, and we never got them. She kept saying they were brewing fresh tea and she'd bring us some out, but she never did. After they took our plates, we waited about another 30 minutes for the check. Finally, I was at my wits end and asked for a manager. The slow service, I can handle. The crap on the table they sat us at, I can handle. The bringing out a bottled beer when my friend specifically ordered draft, I can handle. But having to ask FOUR times for a refill is outrageous and unacceptable."}
{"text":"Lovely little spot for lunch. Partly a market with lots bottled beer selections. Perfect for this college town. Casual and clean. The fries are great as well the food is fresh and cheerfully served  specials are creative and delish. Good place to take guests"}
{"text":"Great wine selection and butcher! The Duck fat fries will change your life."}
{"text":"Tucked in the back of a deli (serving Boar's Head) and market (many, many different kinds of beer) is a gem of a place that serves the Belmont gentry a range of appetizers, sandwiches, salads,and flatbreads.  If you come to Belmont and you're looking for a place with reliably good food and are willing to pay a bit for the privilege, The String Bean should be your first choice. 

The sandwiches are perhaps a little pricey for what you get, but they do taste good and the sweet potato fries offered with them beat the standard fare offered at other places.  Don't like sweet potato fries?  Get an app order of duck fat fries.  Duck fat fries outside of the big city?  Yeah, blew my mind too.

Virtually all of the sauces that I've had from here - a soy sauce-centric dressing and a creamy wasabi dressing for tuna, a ranch spiked with dill for a side salad, are made in-house and are very good.  The gravy for a pork chop special was not quite on the mark, but it wasn't bad.

You can see the whimsy and capability in the chef by the daily lunch and dinner specials, which include appetizers, a soup, entrees and desserts.  I've only had one of these (the pork chop) so far, but my advice is to check their Google Calendar or their Facebook profile the day you intend to go and judge for yourself how the food sounds to you. 

The service is friendly, feeling less like a handful of career waitstaff and more like a handful of young adults who are invested in the success of the place.  It's a good feeling, and one they communicate well.  Outdoor seating is more comfortable here than at many other places with nice furniture on a bricked-in patio, and a fireplace that will surely be an attraction in the late fall.

The last and maybe most important thing?  Deep-fried oreos.  Let me say it again: DEEP FRIED OREOS.  Are these state fair staples as good here as you'd hope?  Oh yeah.

If you live in Belmont, this should be a regular stop for you if you like good food.  If you don't, consider stopping by anyway.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great great place. Great beer menu maybe 20 craft beers on tap, 10 in bottles. Great selection. Wife had crab cake salad- really good crab cake on top of fresh greens, etc. I had the red raider sandwich- pork BBQ with onion rings and sauce with super great fries. Sit outside if you can. Wonderful lunch venue. We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!
We are visiting and this place popped up on yelp... so we said why not!  I'll say this... if you live close make it a weekly habit to go!
The boom boom shrimp to the blackened fillet tips salad is the bomb.com!!!
10 out of 10 for me!
Service is spot on, over 100 beers to chose from and the food is YUM!
Just drive here already!"}
{"text":"Being a frequent work traveler, I dine out a lot. I had heard such good things about this little spot that I thought it was worthy of my drive. How wrong I was.

1) It took 15 minutes to flag someone down to come and take my order on a non-busy Wednesday night.
2) I placed my order, starting with a glass of Viognier on their laminated menu. As a wine/beer shop, you might think they'd want to update this list pretty frequently. But apparently not. I had my heart set on this white wine, which they were obviously out of, and the uneducated waitress wanted to offer me a glass of a less than stellar Pinot Grigio as a replacement. No thanks. You have plenty of other bottles in your shop. Offer an adequate replacement.
3) The appetizer edamame was poorly flavored and just full of salt.
4) The duck fat fries? Um, you tasted like normal fries to me. And not really good ones at that.
5) The only marginally ok thing about this meal was my BLFT. Because it would take a complete dolt to ruin a sandwich with fried green tomatoes.

Needless to say, I will NOT be back. And recommend you staying far away as well."}
{"text":"Love this place so much, wish I could eat here more often.  The service was great when we were there, and I love the small-town feel of everything.  Food = amazing.

Can we talk about the Duck Fat Fries for a minute? Outrageous.  And this is probably the only place you can get them in Gaston County (Lord help us).  Delicious beers as far as the eye can see.  Cute little stuff in their shoppy shop.  

I hope my memory isn't skewed, because this was one of the first places I went out to eat to when my son was but a wee babe.  A meal out and a beer any time in the 6 months after he was born was to be savored."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place many times so decided to give it a try today for lunch.  Wasn't very busy when we got there- maybe only 5 tables seated outdoors on the patio. When we went to the hostess stand we were told to go ahead and sit anywhere we wanted. We decided to sit outdoors as they have a great patio area. Well after sitting there for no less than 10 minutes- and having at least 3 waitresses and 1 bus boy walk by our table without even one of them make eye contact or acknowledging us, we flagged down one of the waitresses only to be cut off with a brusque \" just a second\".  When she finally came over, no hi or welcome to the restaurant comment, instead she wanted to know who sat us at the table we were at.. When we told her an employee at the hostess stand told us we could seat ourselves, she was like \" fine, what do u want to drink??\" I asked for a menu because I know they have an extensive selection of beer and wanted to see what was available before deciding.. We got nothing but attitude from her and felt very uncomfortable and unwelcome. Now because I'd heard great reviews about this place I was willing to push through and overlook some of the rudeness.  We sat there for a while waiting for our drinks and when we got them they were just dropped off at the table without one word and then she walked off.. My glass was  cracked on the bottom and a piece of glass actually broke off when my finger caught on it.. When we brought this to her attention not even an \" I'm sorry\" she just took it off the table, looked at it and said \" so what do you want to order??\" My husband had asked to speak to the manager probably 10 minutes earlier and when he finally came out, he was full of attitude as well.. We may or may not give this place a try again, if we do it won't be anytime soon.  What I do know is the staff AND direct management need a crash course in customer service..."}
{"text":"Cute little hidden gem in the cute little town of Belmont. Everything from their beers to wines to fresh selection of meats are ON POINT. Definitely not overpriced at all and the service is always great, although they are always busy and you have to be semi patient. I recommend this place for a place to stop for lunch or a casual dinner with friends or your loved one. Keep up the awesome work! I will definitely be coming in more often"}
{"text":"Found this place looking on Yelp. Very pleased. Has a large beer and wine menu and food and service were fantastic. Remarked to my wife that I wished I has as much energy as our waitress."}
{"text":"Wow!  Never thought I would like eggplant fries and now I am a huge fan.  Excellent beer selection and fri badly staff.  I was visiting on business and recommend sitting at the bar and talking to the locals.  Cowpig burger is good, but a little on the Smokey side.  I should have gone with the hotter version that the bartender recommended.  Next time!"}
{"text":"I am a Belmont resident and love to support my local businesses and see them succeed but each time my family and I try to enjoy dining at this restaurant it seems we end up leaving disappointed if not downright angry. Service is poor, wait times ridiculous, food mediocre at best, odd menu choices, and poor a/c creates sauna like zones inside. Just last night, Friday, 7/10/15 my husband and I tried yet again...we arrived at 8pm, waited an hour for a table (even tho several sat empty), hostess got drink orders, at 9:30p while many servers bumped into our table all refused eye contact let alone take or order we left. Being so late we went to Wendy's and had a much more enjoyable experience. While Belmont offers great restaurants this is not one of them. I would suggest Glenway Pub or Sammy's if looking for casual dining."}
{"text":"So after my second visit to The String Bean I decided it was time to write a review...something I rarely do. My first visit resulted in the pork chop, which was out of this world good!!! And The mac-n-cheese...real deal amazingness. I just got finished inhaling the Cowpig. Any time someone grinds bacon into a burger patty, they've done a good thing. And the beer selection is constantly changing from what I can tell, with high quality craft brews. If you live in the Charlotte area and haven't eaten here, do yourself a favor."}
{"text":"Nice staff, unique food options and a relaxing patio area. Can be a little pricey but worth a visit."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place in Belmont.  Near perfect salad, nice wine selection, fun atmosphere. Didn't mind the prices but would have appreciated/expected a bit of bread with the salad."}
{"text":"Good food . Good location , parking is limited . Service is ok . Kinda of upbeat vibe, the last time my sister was in town from Southern Cal we went there just for dessert . They were out of Oreos to make the deep fried Oreos .., so it's kinda hit and miss ."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening around 5/530p. I was with a party of 3, including a baby so we had to wait about 40 minutes or so to get a table. There were some high tops available at that point but, unfortunately, no bueno for babies.

Our server was Justin and he was fantastic. Super knowledgable and attentive. He was very busy due to his number of tables but our orders were all correct and he was great at checking up on us. The baby started to get a little fussy towards the end of the meal and he was super sweet and quick when we had to pack everything up to go.

I had the friend pickles, which were much bigger (in diameter and thickness) than any other fried pickles I'd ever seen. They were served hot from the fryer, however, I found them to taste better towards the middle/end of the meal when they were closer to being warm slash room temperature.

I also had the veggie burger with a side of mashed potatoes. The veggie burger was made in house and was delicious. It was a little dry but that is because I ordered it without the sour cream. Overall a winner though.

They don't have tons of vegetarian options (one other entree, a portobella sandwich and an eggplant sandwich) that are creative so I likely wouldn't go back while in the area; I'd prefer to check out a new place. But excellent service by both our server and host staff. 

There's also a butcher and small market that sells various food items and alcohol inside. 

The actual restaurant area is a little on the smaller side so I would skip this place for a party larger than 6. Parking lot can get crowded so street parking may be necessary."}
{"text":"Ok.  I got the figgy flatbread and it was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I couldn't have been happier.  Now, my friends got the duck fat fries: awful, tasted a day old, and something else that I don't even remember because it was not good.  This review is based on my meal only.  It was a Saturday and very crowded, but we were actually seated right away.  They have a nice selection of beer and wine, also specialty meats and cheeses to buy for home.  I was disappointed they got rid of their meat and cheese tray to eat there, but the flatbread made up for it.  The service was very good.  When I go back, I WILL get the same thing for sure.  Great!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks now. They brought out cold food. The kitchen manager came out to dress  me down after I sent the food back. They removed the item from our bill but no other manager came over after the kitchen manager came out to harass me. We have been enjoying food from here for years. But service and food quality has been slipping for the last 5 or 6 times we have been here. The final straw was when I called the manager of the place to speak about our problem during a less busy time. It has now been a week simce the visit and phone call and still have not gotten a return call. It is very apparent the weekly trips to buy meat and beers and bi weekly trips to purchase expensive meals are not worth their time. So avoid the string bean at all costs. This place has gone down hill and the management/ownership does not care if their customers of many years are satisfied."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Very friendly and attentive servers. Excellent food!  BBQ egg rolls; delicious. The Cuban; best I've ever had. Fried Oreos; the perfect way to end a great meal. It's one of our favorites in the Charlotte area!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quaint local restaurant.  Look no further! This place is the epitome of coziness, good food and great service (server was Angela). I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes (which I am usually not a fan, but these were cooked exceptionally well and the flavor mayo sauce on top, reminded me of a spicy mayo that they use on sushi rolls)..DELICIOUS! I also had a tuna fish salad sandwich (they used ahi tuna and it was so fresh)...Also, before you leave take a stroll through the in-house market which carries a pleaothera of foriegn and domestic beers and wine.  The market also has fresh meats (ie Steak/lamb/fish/etc).. Also there is a little antique store down the raod that is amazing!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal he this past weekend. The building was easy to find and since we arrived around 2:30 the was plenty of parking. We were nicely greeted at the door and we chose to stir at the bar. I believe the bartenders name was Shane. He was very knowledgeable and very open to answering all of our questions. We ordered and it didn't take long for our food to come out. Everything was great. My hubby ordered a beer flight. He loved the Passion Fruit Gose the most. Will definitely be back soon. Check them out."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise! We went here recently for a Saturday night date and both really enjoyed our experience. We called earlier in the day and made a dinner reservation (note: they don't do reservations between 6-8, so we just made our reservation for 5:45). We started with beers and both liked what we got. I wish they had more on draft but they had a ton of options otherwise. 

For meals, my fiancé got the Cowpig and duck fat fries, which he liked a lot. I ordered the hot chicken sliders with fries. It was really good and spicy! The food took awhile to come out but our food was discounted because of it, which we appreciated. For dessert, we splurged and tried the fried Oreos and we were not disappointed! 

Overall, 4.5 stars, which I'm gonna round up to 5!"}
{"text":"Dont know why I keep coming here, I guess  because there arent many options in Belmont. For the price of the food I expect it to taste better. I've been 3 times now and I'm not impressed. Service is slow, staff have zero personalities,  prices are too high and food isn't good. Tonight my wife got a steak tip salad with bacon, feta, strawberries and almonds. The salad didn't have bacon and the strawberries were rotten. We had to ask for new of both. For $15 the salad was horrible. I got a chicken wrap with fries which was dry and the fries were old and horrible. We like the patio and the ber and wine selections and will probably return just for that."}
{"text":"food took forever, the pizza i ordered was over half way burnt, the waitress filled our waters only once and didn't check on us at all. we waited for our change back and the waitress asked us if we wanted our \"70 cents\" back with the rest of our change and we said no, when we walked away and not even out of the restaurant the waitress yelled \"oh great they tipped me 70 cent!\" waving the bill around. our meal was not expensive and the service was awful. can not believe the rude service."}
{"text":"Food is OK if you can get someone to take your order.  The food, however, is not consistent."}
{"text":"Take a bar, a butchery shop, a wine shop, and a sandwich restaurant.   Shake, but don't stir.  Add some delectable appetizers, nice southern hospitality and a great patio, and what do you get?  The String Bean.

Inside dining is for about 50, with tables either by the bar or amidst the isles of specialty beers and wine.  Right behind the reception desk is the butcher case, where you can purchase the same meats the restaurant uses for their burgers and sandwiches, or some seafood (also on the menu).

One of those meats they use in their burger is the \"cow-pig\".  Smoked bacon ground into beef.   Yum!

Most of the meals are at $12 or less,  with appetizers and sandwiches less than $10.  I guess their daily catch might be more,  but the menu seems a pretty decent value."}
{"text":"Took us ten minutes to just get a server, even though we reserved a table. We finally had to ask for a passing server if she knew who our server was. She looked bothered that we had to even ask her. After we overhear the back and forth of who did not want the table, we finally were greeted 15 minutes after we were seated. They were not busy like we have seen them before so this could not have been the issue.

The appetizers were great and had my expectations high for the coming meal. I decided to get the market price steak 20oz at 16.99 lb. with a crab cake fries and salad. $52.00 later I received a steak that was overcooked, a crab cake that was not lump crab, and a salad that did not come until they put the steak in front of me. 

The bill comes and even though it is al-a-cart I did not receive an itemized bill. It said market price $52. I think we were taken advantage of by their \"Market price\", it is highly inflated and they give no explanation of charges. 

The 12oz filet my friend ordered was cooked med rare on the outside and rare in the middle. Same sides as my meal minus the salad was $55.00. Never again!!!!

After tip for four people $250.00. No way it is worth the the service or the food. Never even saw a person that resembled a manager or was asked how my steak was."}
{"text":"When we looked at the large menu, I immediately wanted to order about half of it. We decided to get a ton of appetizers and share them as a group. 

We got the duck fat fries, the BBQ egg rolls, the potato skins, the fig and goat cheese flatbread, the quesadilla, the fried green tomatoes, the shrimp, the slider trio, and the pimento cheese. The only thing that was disappointing was the pimento cheese. The rest was incredibly good. My favorites were the flatbread, the egg rolls, the shrimp, and the duck fat fries. 

Along with the restaurant, the other side is a little market with a large beer and wine selection. 

We came around 3 so it wasn't crowded and we don't have to wait, but it did get crowded closer to dinner. 

There are still so many things on the menu that I want to try so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The String Bean was a fantastic find on Yelp. It has a farmhouse feel and country vibe with average prices for food.

- In-house butcher
- Beer on tap
- Interesting meat blends
- Healthy food options 
- Small parking lot
- Specials are usually pricey $$

Before you read any further, just know that for $2 extra you can get duck fat fries that will change your life. I don't think that I can look at regular fries the same, although their sweet potato fries were crispy and delicious for second place.

If you are looking at the menu and feel overwhelmed try the beef and pork blended burger. It has a good kick and smoky flavor. They also give you a very healthy portion of fries.

The in-house butcher mixes and blends the multi-meat patties to provide delicious Frankenstein burgers that are park cow/pig or even duck/cow. The result is fresh and packed with flavor.

There's some healthy options for those that graze on the greens but the result is usually more money.

Overall, the Sting Bean has some great options and for only $30 you can get lunch for two, be completely satisfied, and feel healthy as well."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and terrible service. We have called ahead several times and are always having to wait 45 minutes when we arrive. Make a sandwich at home - it will cost less and save you the frustration."}
{"text":"I wasn't as impressed as I expected to be, but still an overall decent meal.

They had an impressive draft and bottle list, which we were excited about. We were able to have great beer with our meal. However, it is difficult to keep the menu up b/c of the constant bottle rotation. We asked our server about several beers, and she had to continue to go inside and check if the bottle was still available. 

We ordered the bison quesadilla and a reuben with duck fat fries. Now don't get me wrong the duck fat fries are good, but I do not think they are as good as everyone is saying. I have had better, but I did enjoy them. The reuben was solid. As was the quesadilla. I think I may have preferred the quesadilla a bit more. 

I will say one thing. They need to make sure their hours are consistent with what is shown online. Their doors had different hours posted than online. We came in plenty of time to be seated, but there were several parties who showed up after the posted hours on the door, but they had to serve them because the hours listed online were longer. I felt bad for the servers because they were technically closed, but they still had to serve those who came in because of the discrepancies. 

I live in Charlotte and will likely not drive all the way to Belmont for the String Bean, but I definitely will enjoy it when driving through. The staff was excellent and kind and that is half the battle."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but a bit pricey.  However, their beer and wine selection is superb!"}
{"text":"Terrific food, service is so so and just depends who you get.  Recently we had a new person and he didn't know much about the menu.  We ordered Curious George (Banana bread French toast and served warm w/ bananas & maple syrup).  OMG so good!  and Chicken salad on croissant with eggplant fries (to die for!) . The outdoor patio with strung lights gives great ambience for an outdoor bistro.  Love it!"}
{"text":"always good... I'm a vegan and their black bean burger is to die for!"}
{"text":"A favorite .  Food and service has always been great when visiting.  Enjoy bringing clients and friends here."}
{"text":"The food was very good! I enjoyed my black bean wrap and house chips. However, there was no sense of urgency to wait on us. The customer service could use some improvement at the hostess stand."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch is where its at.

Sunday's they have a nice brunch setting outside in the morning, and they have nice special little menu to order.  The meal that you should eat is  the chicken and waffles.  

A huge Belgian waffle with fried chicken, gravy, and syrup will make you feel fat and happy. Coffee is served in a nice big mug ( I happened to get a fun mug from Niagara Falls- Maid of the Mist).  Also, served with brunch is a \"make your own bloody-marry bar\" and mimosas.

Inside, they have nice shop and really good beer selection.  Grad some nice micro-brews for the afternoon, after eating brunch."}
{"text":"I stopped in to the Bean  early on a Friday evening for dinner before a Grizzlies game.  I arrived around 5:30pm and the restaurant was about 40% full.  I took a seat at the bar because it appeared that the smattering of tables open had all been reserved (as indicated by the pieces of paper on the tables).  As has been mentioned before, things are pretty dark from a lighting perspective in the restaurant, but I found sufficient lighting at the bar (when was the last time you read that phrase?).  

Jen greeted me at the bar and took my drink order and offered me a menu.  I asked her for her top three appetizers and she suggested the fried green tomatoes, fried pickles, and duck fries.  I went with the toms and went with one of the evening's specials for dinner (pan-seared salmon with mango salsa, rice cake, and grilled asparagus).

The appetizer was out within ten minutes.  It consisted of three thick-cut slices of green tomato that were fried and stacked like a tower with pepper jack cheese between each slice.  This was then drizzled with a chipotle ranch sauce.  These toms were really good.  I loved the combo of the sweet toms and the spicy ranch and cheese.

Then it was time for the entree.  The presentation was top-notch and it was almost too purdy to eat.  But I paid good money for it and I was going to eat it.  The salmon was cooked to my specs although there wasn't enough salsa to my liking.  A quick shout-out to Jen brought out some more salsa.  It was more of the contrast in themes, although this time it was sweet and salty.  The asparagus was flavorful, but unfortunately the rice was white.  Would have loved some brown rice, but it is what it is.

Excellent service and some really good food here.  I don't make it out to Belmont to often, but I hope to make it back again in the near future."}
{"text":"The String Bean in Belmont never disappoints. I love that their menu offers a variety of foods that are unique and fresh. I ordered the chicken salad croissant with a side of pasta salad, both of which were delicious. The chicken salad had great flavor - it had nuts, grapes, and celery to compliment the chicken. The chicken salad itself wasn't too wet or too dry, it was just right. The flakey, buttery croissant was so yummy. Their pasta salad is a balsamic-based pasta salad, and it was awesome.

The atmosphere in the String Bean is kind of like classy rustic, if you can imagine that. We had excellent service. Our server checked in regularly to refill drinks, find out if we needed anything, and he was so friendly.

They have an awesome beer and wine selection. I will definitely be back to the String Bean. It's worth the drive from Charlotte, for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and it is never hit or miss. The String Bean is ALWAYS my favorite place to grab a bite to eat. My personal favorites are their duck fat fries, eggplant fries, the their fried green tomato blt, & their arugula, goat cheese, fig spread, prosciutto, and balsamic vinegar flat bread pizza. It's to die for. If you haven't been to The String Bean, you definitely need to try it out. The customer service is wonderful and the food is terrific, and the environment is charming."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Belmont. Wine selection is great - it has a wine shop within. Also patio is wonderful. Most weekends they have live music and there are string lights overhead that give it a great ambiance. 

Food is usually pretty good. Generally consistent quality, though I've had a few times that it doesn't seem as good as others. 

My only other reason I would hold back the last star: no online reservation system. You have to call. Wish it was digital/online. But otherwise I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would give closer to 3.5 and I think I need to give it another chance, but we may have had an unusual wait today. First of all great atmosphere and setup, likes that they had beer tasting and a great drink selection. The quality of the burgers (husband had sliders) was top notch, but my seared tuna salad was not worth the 50 minute wait at all. Maybe I'll go there for a beer or when I don't mind hanging out and waiting for my food at the bar."}
{"text":"I love eating at The String Bean when I'm in the area. I've only had the burgers, the bison burger is my favorite, but they are always delicious and juicy. I like the selection of craft beers and other items for purchase."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love String Bean, so I hate to have to write this review. We've been here at least a half a dozen times in the last couple of months and the first few trips were great: amazing service, delicious food, and a greet beer selection. The last three visits, however, have been terrible. 

On one visit, they were out of their signature CowPig burger. Not a huge deal, I just ordered another burger without caramelized onions. After waiting 30 minutes, the burger came out overloaded with onions. Even after picking them off, the burger still tasted like onion and was inedible. They did make me another one, but by that time my husband had long finished his meal so it wouldn't get cold and we both alone. 

We understand that one bad experience doesn't make a restaurant so we decided to try again a couple weeks later and while the food was good-they have the BEST sweet potato fries!- the service was super slow. 

This evening was by far the worst, though, and marks the last time we will be eating at String Bean. We waited for a table outside because it was so nice out and had no problem waiting. Once we were seated, our server was less than cheerful. Our two burgers took almost an hour to come out, during which time she returned to our table one time to refill my water but did not say anything-about how we were doing or letting us know the status of our order. Both of our burgers were over cooked, with my husband saying his tasted like charcoal; his fries were also so overcooked that I could hear them crunch from across the table. Needless to say, he did not eat them. She finally brought his second beer after his meal had already been cleared by someone else. She said maybe a total of 12 words to us the entire meal, and that is being generous. By time she brought the check, we had been at our table for an hour and a half and she did not come back to pick it up and after almost 15 minutes I eventually had to take it up to the front so we could leave. 

Like I said, I really wanted to love The String Bean because I have had delicious food here and it's a cute spot with great beer. Unfortunately, though, the service and poor quality do not make 2 burgers and 2 beers worth $50 with a tip. I expect better and will have to look elsewhere for a decent burger in Belmont."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a road trip and got some food to go and it was absolutely amazing. Their barbecue egg rolls were so delicious they have the best food if I ever come back to Belmont I'm definitely stopping back here again. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was really cool!"}
{"text":"Worth the drive from wherever you're traveling. Small in size, very big in service and quality. We had the Cuban and Rueben sandwiches. Both very good. Sweet potato fries a must."}
{"text":"Great food, hamburger, salmon, green fried tomatoes were tasteful!
I went back to this restaurant twice, as I am from Chicago. I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Service can get slow when the restaurant is full, but the food is great!"}
{"text":"Amazing appetizers...

...Boom, Boom Shrimp and Duck Fat Fries are everything!

A must-try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here yesterday. We sat outside as the weather was gorgeous. The patio was nice and food was good. Ordered the chicken salad and portions were huge. Service was okay, took a little long to get our food after ordering considering we both got sandwiches, but staff was all very nice. Excited to try something different next time."}
{"text":"Shane at the bar, he's no friend of mine; but he treats you like he is.  Spectacular service!! Two thumbs up.  Food was great!  Green fried beans, a bit on the salty side for my taste, but still very good!  Burgers!  Oh the Burgers!  And the beer menu is outstanding.  If I am back here in town, most defiantly will return. Side \"store\" is also very interesting."}
{"text":"It takes forever to get you food here.  Not sure who runs their operations, but simple things about grill management seem to allude them. If two things take different times to cook, then don't start them at the same time. If you order a steak with your meal, other things will be overcooked because they sat under the heat lamp.  The most recent time I went there it took an hour and fifteen minutes to get our food and I just decided I can't come anymore. I'll try coming back in a couple years."}
