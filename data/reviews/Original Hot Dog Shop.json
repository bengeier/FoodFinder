{"text":"Go for the fries and the atmosphere (hey, I like my dirty), don't get your hopes up too high for the hot dogs.  They're passable but not worth what they charge.  The fries, however, are awesome.  And the fact that they sell alcohol there still boggles my mind!

Oddly, I go to a hot dog stand in WA that actually has delicious gourmet hot dogs for CHEAPER.  How does that work out?  Must be the hype driving the prices."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs - all beef available. Good variety of toppings which they are generous about putting on. No complaints! Nice char on the dogs. If you are visiting campus or the museums, this is a nice walk for when you get hungry. Fries are also good. Oh but the bathroom smells so nasty that I thought I might vomit so try to go somewhere else first!!"}
{"text":"I know that this is an institution but it really isn't worth the price. I think if I were drunk at 3:00am though, then I would be writing otherwise.

Don't bother unless you're drunk. Go for the hot dog."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are good and the condiment selection is very extensive. The sandwiches are pretty good but are a bit pricey. The fries however, are absolutely godly. As everyone says, GET THE GRAVY. The O is open late but after a certain point in time (I believe 12:30 AM) there is a 15% security fee added on to your order."}
{"text":"Anyone who gives this place less than 5 stars is clinically insane. EVERYONE has been here while drunk at 3am and if you haven't quit being sheltered and get down there. This is the greasiest, grimiest, most delicious hot dog and french fry shop east of Detroit(Lafayette Coney I see you). The \"O\" is most famous for its very healthy french fry portions, it's all-beef hot dogs with numerous free toppings,  a small fry here is legitimately too big for two people, and an all-the-way dog is a mountain of mustard, sauerkraut, pickles and who knows what.  They also have pizza(don't do it) and chicken tenders and whatnot, but just do fries or a hotdog and you'll be ok.  The Original is what going out to eat is all about; pigging out and occasionally witnessing a fight between pimps. On that note Friday and Saturday nights are especially lit since the O stays open til 4 am and everyone is hanging out partying when the clubs and bars get out. Not to be missed if you visit the burgh. Try to avoid the bathroom."}
{"text":"Great food if you are intoxicated and brave enough to venture in after dark. The food here is greasy but satisfying. If you have heart disease or a short temper I advise you to stay away. The O's staff is generally unfriendly. The location is right below Pitt's towers where you hope a drunk girl doesn't vomit on you. I'm surprised the hours! After 2 a.m. and the students have all stumbled back in to their dorms is when the trouble starts with the city folks. Go with a friend and enjoy a Pitt Classic !"}
{"text":"Four stars because this place is an institution.  Not just fries, but a BAG of fries.  Be prepared to share with everyone you know and even someone you don't know.  The pizzas also aren't bad, especially for the price, but late at night, be prepared to wait awhile while all the other drunken patrons are getting their own food.  

Oh, the store is not the best place to actually eat you food, but just take it home and start that second party."}
{"text":"The staff is awful, they don't take credit cards, you have to order different menu items from different counters, refills cost extra. The food was average, nothing to write home about. The only reason they are still in business is because they are a novelty, and the appeal to drunk college kids for late night food."}
{"text":"While looking for a place to eat for lunch, I came across this joint and decided to give it a try. When you step inside, there is a distinctively familiar feeling that you've been here before...the midnight munchies in college. The place looks like one match away from a fiery inferno and the metallic bathroom in the basement had so much grease on the floor that I couldn't stop sliding. I was hoping that my sophomore mantra \"the dirtier the place, the better the food\" was going to hold true. It didn't. 

There seemed to be 2 main stations for food and one for beer. The hot dogs are overcooked and just ok, but the fries are plentiful and made to order. The guy just plopped them on my tray like a shrapnel grenade...some hitting me and some falling to the ground. Prices are ok.

What did I have:
Original dog - meh
Small...I mean extra large fries (Point Brugge is the best so far in Pitt) 
Diet Coke

When did I go:
Weekday @ noon

Will I come back?
Only if I need to get my fix for fries with friends in Oakland"}
{"text":"Always a good stop at the O.  Fries are excellent.  Pizzas are good.  Burgers are good.  Just an all around American eatery."}
{"text":"The meal was tasty and the ambiance is what you would expect for a college hang out. I didn't try their hotdogs but I am a huge fan of those steak and cheese and fries. Friend had the pizza and they seemed to like it. If you are looking for a one of a kind experience that is oh in Pittsburgh this is near the top of the list in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! This is my favorite restraunt to come to whenever I visit Pittsburgh. The french fries are amazing! And the cheese and the gravy that you can dip them in is awesome. There's nothing better than it. The burgers weren't great, but the hot dogs were awesome. Definitely come here."}
{"text":"I've been here many of times and always find the food consistent and tasty with pretty reasonable prices for what you're getting. However, the service is why I'm giving this place a 3 instead of a 5 star review. I went last week with my girlfriend after a long morning at work and decided I wanted to grab a sandwich. As we approached the front counter where you order food, we heard the man working behind the counter rudely tell another customer to get out of the way so we could order, but we were still looking over the menu so there was no reason for this. When I asked a question about one of the sandwiches, his attitude and verbage was super rude and sassy while he tried to make me feel like an idiot for not knowing what kind of bread a certain sandwich was served on. We then put down our order and received our food 10 minutes later. Food was tasty as usual, we sat in the upstairs dining area which is pretty empty most of the time. On the way out the side door of the restaraunt, the same cashier from earlier was on his way in from a smoke break. I asked for his name and I'm pretty sure he said Steve as he blew his hit into my face and bumped into me while walking back in. Probably never returning after that one, thanks Steve"}
{"text":"BEST HOT DOG SHOP IN THE BURGH! I took my boyfriend (born and raised in Las Vegas) here right off the plane. Needless to say, HE LOVED IT! Very clean and welcoming. Loved the philly cheese steak advertised out front"}
{"text":"Having transplanted out of Pittsburgh some years ago, I find it disturbing that I still having cravings for 1am deliveries of The O's delicious, thick chocolate milk shakes, and their heart disease-inducing cheese fries. Oh my god, I miss The O -- no one does fast, greasy spoon food like they do!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the hot dogs at  \" The O\"  BUT  can't resist their french fries.  Had a large one recently but I recall, back in the day, getting the XL size  ( 5 pounds of potatoes!!! )  and having eating contests with them.

The milk shakes aren't too bad either but stay away from the pizza."}
{"text":"Sandwich was not the greatest but fries were good. A size \"small\" could feed about 4 people.

You can buy some really nasty teenage girl malt liquors in here."}
{"text":"4 pounds of fresh cut greasy french fries with cheese sauce and ketchup has to be had at least once if you are in Pittsburgh.  They literally cover a plastic cafeteria tray with fries for about $5.00 They aren't that great, but there sure are a lot of em."}
{"text":"I went to college in Pittsburgh, and had more than my fair share of drunken nights at \"The O,\" but haven't been back for over 15 years.  When I was back in town, I HAD to go back.

After reading the reviews, it sounded like things had really gone downhill.  People complaining about it being filthy, dirty, and the hot dogs being disgusting.  So I was a little nervous when I walked in, but when I did, I found out that it was the same old O, and also that there are a bunch of whiners here on Yelp.

Seriously, whining about having to order your fries from a different counter than your hot dog?  Seriously?  Like someone else said, order your fries, then go get your hot dog (with mustard, relish, and sauerkraut, please!) and then go back and get your fries.  Be sure to get GRAVY with your fries.

Haha, and all the whining about the bathroom.  Seriously?  Did you really think that the bathrooms in that place would be clean?  Seriously?  I've never actually gone down the \"staircase to nowhere\" where the bathrooms are.  At least not that I can remember (i.e. I quite possibly did in a drunken stupor one day.)  Where is the street smarts in kids these days? 

Of course it gets crowded at night.  But, if you go in the daytime, there should be no real wait.  Plus, your chances of being the victim of a drive by go WAY down.

Y'all SHOULD be up in arms about what's happened AROUND the O.  Zelda's turned into a 5 guys?  WTF?  C.J. Barneys turned into a DUNKIN' DONUTS?  You've got to be f-ing kidding me!

You go to the O for awesome (but greasy) fries (don't forget the GRAVY!) and decent hot dogs.  The burgers and chicken parm sandwiches are good too.  The pizza has never been good.  But you have to eat O pizza when you're drunk anyway.  You just do.

I guess if you want sterile chain burgers and fries you can just go next door to 5 guys now.  But if you want to be shot at while eating tasty crispy dogs and a mountain of fries with ketchup and gravy cooked in the same grease for the past 50 years, while drinking a 40 of malt liquor, you've got to go to the O.  I guess you either get this place or you don't."}
{"text":"The O does something I hate.  A lot of places do this, but it needs to stop.  

The smallest order of fries is more than one person can eat.  They charge you $3.50 for it but you only end of eating $1.50.  The rest goes into the trash, or rather, into the owners pocket since I can't imagine the potatoes and ketchup cost much.

The O clearly survives on nostalgia.  They're unlikely to change a damn thing if they've survived in Oakland for so long, but I can't help but wish.

Other than the fries (which were excellent, but should only ever be shared), I have little to recommend."}
{"text":"Awful hot dogs, greasy ass carnie fries that are more of a guilty pleasure than anything else, and disgusting pizza.  The burger's are alright here though."}
{"text":"I cannot FUCKING BELIEVE I didn't visit here the last time I was in town.  Sweet Jesus, I love the O.  And I've never even had one of their famous hotdogs.  No, I'm all about those fries, and the pizza too.  But now I just want to eat it all.  Every last one.  I want to grow a huge ass that is composed of nothing but O fries and cheese.  I guess that's one dream that won't come true.  Sob, sob."}
{"text":"Weird place, but it is a real \"Road Food\" place, as noted in Jan and Michael Stern's blog/site/book. 

One counter is for hotdogs, another for sandwiches and fries and still another for pizza, and then you go upstairs to eat. 

Clearly a place that caters to the still-drunk crowd after midnight from Pitt and CMU. 

The fries are just stupid-big. A large could literally feed a group of 10 more. Get a small and go from there. The large is literally an entire bin from the frier. Our group ate maybe 1/8 and tossed the rest. 

The dogs are good, though not in the Grays Papaya category. 

A definite real road food place/experience when you go to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've been coming here my whole life (23 years). It used to be my favorite place to go.  Nothing better then a chili cheese dog. Over the years it has changed. Its now a over priced fast food place. Lost its character and charm. If I wanted to spend $5 on a hotdog I could go to the pirate game."}
{"text":"Was delish! Hot dogs made the way you want. Chili can be added at no additional cost. Serving of fries are enough for 3 people. Def. Yummers! Plenty of room to sit n eat upstairs."}
{"text":"Stopped by after picking my daughter up at Pitt campus. The fries were amazing...and huge. The large order was more than enough for all four of us who were eating there. Definitely recommend these! However, the cheesesteak hoagie (sub) and mushroom cheesesteak hoagie were below average. The meat reminded me of the frozen thin packaged Steak-Ums and it was very tough. Plus, be warned that they charge extra for ketchup...yes, really. You get two containers with a large order of fries, then you have to pay 45 cents for each additional container. Also, restrooms are fairly disgusting, probably because, as my daughter explained, it's a late-night stop after the students hit the local bars.

Entrance is confusing initially. One counter for ordering pizza, one for ordering hot dogs, and a third for subs. Coolers are locked from the front, so you have to wait for the cook (who is also the order-taker) to retrieve your selection. Beer in cans and bottles is available in addition to soda."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is about in some of the reviews.  It's a hot dog cooked crispy burned.  It was fairly expensive for a campus hot dog joint to boot.  I gave it a 2 star because we didn't try any of the other items.  Lots of better choices in the area."}
{"text":"I have lived around Pittsburgh born and raised. I had always wanted to try this place but never got around to it. I am now sorry I found the time. Atmosphere was great, history was awesome, service ok, fries stupendous but very costly. Now, my hobby is hot dogs, wieners, etc and the ones here are TERRIBLE & AWFUL. Chili sucked too. And $5 a doggie? I will NEVER go back there, what a joke. I think people just feel going there is the thing to do. Now if you wanna chill and have some fries, excellent choice. If you are a conniseur of hot dogs, the worst choice. At least now I can say I have been there. But never again."}
{"text":"Classic Pittsburgh food... Hot dogs, fries, pizza and beer.  The fries are awesome.  If you get a large you'll need help... And don't forget the cheese sauce.  Prices have gone up over the years, but it's still worth it.
Experience a classic."}
{"text":"The service here is so curt and brusque that it makes New Yorkers look like Southern Gentlemen.  Eat here one time when it isn't crowded and then never return.  

I suppose if you're REALLY drunk then this pitiful excuse for a restaurant can satisfy your desire for greasy, well-apportioned food, but at such a level of inebriation you will be risking receiving a citation for public intoxication."}
{"text":"Was part of the closing crew at burger king when 14 years old, still remember the tile floors in the back, shiny as mirrors from the grease. There are rubber mats to ensure footing. You'd feel like a slime ball when you left, 2am. That's how you feel 2 steps into the O. And for god's sake order to go, can't recount how many wild characters I've seen gathered here once the sun goes down. Employees remind of the albino from Princess Bride. Have seen people not get their food AND get turned away a la Soup Nazi.

Get the smallest fry order, they're just too large and oily to tackle otherwise. The pizza's on point for salty and cheap NYC drunk March-Madness pizza. We used to eat 5 slices during the 12:40p tip game on First Friday and return after our brackets were busted by the 6-7p dead hour. The pizza's center slop is the best part, lovingly referred to as \"the fetus\". And you can pound a large on your own.

So here's the drill:
1) Drink a few beers to prep
2) Call in 1x large cheese pie per person, to go
3) Slam another beer to buzz-maintain
4) Have your DD drop you off out front once you're rocking that 3 beer buzz
5) Arrive EXACTLY as the pizza is due
6) Hope for an uneventful 5 minutes
7) Pink Floyds \"Run Like Hell\"

Parking can be a snag on crowded college nights so bring two friends--one to circle the block and one to watch your back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. I've only had good times happen in The O. It was the first stop when visiting Pittsburgh for schools with my father who was an alum (both of The O and the school). 

I most recently tried the cheesesteak (needs more cheese), chili cheese dog (needed more chili), fries, and beer. The O is open late and never let's me down when I'm out and needing something at 1am. The fries are awesome, needless to say, given the previous reviews. I'm a ketchup kinda gal. So that's all I need. But to each his own, and while everyone I've been with loves the fries, it's interesting to see the different sauces people douse them with. My German exchange friend did mayonnaise while my roommate did Dijon mustard. Honorable mention to gravy.

This is college late night food at it's finest. If you're going to school in Pittsburgh, going to The O is a rite of passage."}
{"text":"Can't get service.   You wait for 10 minutes and get ignored.  Probably just as well.  The hot dogs look like they were cooked a week ago and then they reheat them.  Clueless staff. Never again."}
{"text":"The dirty O

God, i used to head here after high school when I went shopping at Teleropa and just had to rebel from my ideal suburban parents.

Cheese fries... no, that isn't descriptive enough.  A WHOLE basket of deep dried goodness, covering the red plastic tray and falling to the floor as you searched for a table in this iconic grease ladden Pittsburgh hang out."}
{"text":"Ridicious grease. Too many french fries. Bring an appetite!!

I'd much rather eat at Uncle Sam's!"}
{"text":"Expensive, and bad. Sorry, but the dogs were rubbery and the chili just didn't do it for me. The \"Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe\" out in the burbs blows this place away!"}
{"text":"This place is very \"rustic\"... 

Ok it's a dump, but the hotdogs are amazing which is why this place is a Pittsburgh staple. It's all about the food. The dogs have that \"snap\", and I always seem to gravitate towards the cheese dogs. You also get a mountain of fries if you order them so be prepared to carry around a 2 pound brown bag of French fries. The locks on the coolers of the drinks are a bit off putting, but as long as you're not here in the early hours of the morning you have nothing to worry about. There's also a bar to the left of where you order your food that I have yet to try but they seem to have a lot of different craft beers."}
{"text":"Smokin hot dogs and fries .. everything is pretty good . Good beer selection .. the dirty O says it all"}
{"text":"Food was good and service was good too!
Loved the place so unique.
Dogs, sandwiches,  burgers, pizza & special brew beers!
I will be back!"}
{"text":"THE GREASY O - THE FRIES ARE THE STAR!

This is another Pittsburgh great! A late night lair for the after bar crowd and junk food obsessed! Yes, the dogs are good but the fries are the star - order the largest they have and bring 10 friends!  

Feel young again with the University of Pittsburgh crowd around you and indulge in some greasy goodness!"}
{"text":"Best. Drunk. Food. EVER. Grab some hot dogs, a sack (literally) of fries, a handful of ketchup packets, and get on with your evening. Don't bother sitting in the Dirty O, take your food to go, stumble outside and enjoy Oakland in a drunken, grease-induced haze, you lush."}
{"text":"As a college student, the O is definitely an experience. Whether it's a late study night or a drunk food their french fries are a must! They're open late everyday and bad for you but that's what makes it so great!"}
{"text":"Considering what it is and it's reputation I was mildly impressed with this place! I was disappointed that they had remodeled their bathrooms because I had heard that they were terrible! Now they may compete with something found in old elementary school yet still quite small so ya kinda dissapointing....
Go here again? Yes
Fries? Greasy but yes
Original hot dog? Tough outer skin, probly not....
Complete experience 3.8"}
{"text":"Good, cheap eats near the University of Pittsburgh.  Could see how this would be an awesome late-night spot...but alas we visited during the day for our first ever meal there.

My daughter split their two most famous items...grilled hot dogs and a chicken Parmesan sandwich.  Both of them were just fine (nothing to rave about), just solid food and just he right amount of grease.  The charred dog was great, and the order came with a mountain of fries cooked just right.

For a quickie meal next time through town, this spot could definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"So I made a trip out to my girlfriends home town and decided to try some of the food fair. After visiting the Cathedral of Learning we stumble into the legendary \"O\". Its in a bit of older building that has not been remodeled but only patched as needed. As a fan of this type of establishment I was very please with the 3 menu items I ordered. Medium fries(would hate to see a large, they were massive!): a golden crunchy delight with ketchup (I'm a purist). Spicy Chicken wings: perfectly fried to perfection but not greasy. Hot Dog: all beef with a natural casing that has a nice snap as you take each bit. If your in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh it's with the stop and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I go to the O whenever I'm back in the Burgh. 
Best hot dogs and chili:  sweetest onions by far, and even the mustard is special. 
Fries are awesome also. 
Wish they still served Birch-Beer soda like they did when I was a kid. 
Why 4 stars? Their infamous bathrooms and the floor that seems like there is always an inch of grease on it.  But the dogs and fries trumps everything.
Wish I was there now."}
{"text":"As I am a Pitt alum, your skepticism, dear reader, of this review is natural. But still, lend me your ears (err, eyes). Yes, the O is an infamous Oakland institution, your first accidental order of large fries is a rite of passage when you're a Pitt student, the regular employees look like they came out of a slasher flick, the setup is questionable, and the place is dingy as all hell.

Now, all that out of the way, how's the food? Well, it varies. In general, anything they do in-house or get private label is quite good. To elaborate, their fries are cut fresh, their hot dogs are made exclusively for them, and the hoagies are made to order without frozen ingredients. These are all wonderful. The fries shouldn't be even called fries in a strict sense; they're prepared in the same manner as French or Belgian frites. Due to double frying, the outsides are potato chip crispy, the insides are sublimely creamy, and they're deftly salted. The fact that they're served in absurd portions adds to the experience, as do the lowbrow but delicious options of processed cheese or beef gravy as dips. The hot dogs are natural casing and thus have an unparalleled snap. They lack the mushiness commonly found with lower quality dogs and so eat more like a piece of meat, with excellent spicing to boot. Factor in free chili (among other toppings) and a piece of freshly steamed cheese for $0.50 and you have drunk food bliss or sober great eats. Although I've never tried the subs, I've heard nothing but great things.

The rest of the menu is, unfortunately, mostly pre-frozen including the 21 shrimp (which I admit to gorging on while inebriated), chicken parm sandwich, and fish dinners. Not worth the dough you have to shell out. Why you would order pizza here with $5 Sorrento's or $8 Romano within walking distance is beyond me. The beer selection is puzzlingly excellent."}
{"text":"Definitely one of Pittsburgh's institutions.  Somewhere you have to go if you ever come to Pittsburgh.  The O I had watched on Food Network back in the days and so when I came and visited, I just had to try it.  

They were pretty good but I wanted them to be even better.   Out of this world.  I would definitely come back a second time if I ever visit Pitt again but maybe lower my expectations the second time around so that I could be pleasantly surprised....."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Everything that I have had has been delicious. And the fries, oh my. If you leave there hungry it's your own fault!"}
{"text":"Great dogs and fries, even before 2am!!!  The pizzas are an even better deal.  If you can deal with the other customers and don't mind some grease, this is your place.  Love the O!"}
{"text":"The O. for me is all about the experience. I have been there dozens of times late at night for anything from a hotdog to a corndog to shrimp to the mounds of cheese fries. I literally can spend all night at the place. Being the frugal (Cheap) person I am though, I've always knocked a star off because I feel they are a bit pricey. Still, this is a Pittsburgh institution and one which I do love."}
{"text":"A great place for a good Hot Dog. 

I like my dives, and this would be one of those places that must be experienced.  Take a minute, when you walk in to familiarize yourself, there are two entrances, come in on Forbes, and to your right, you will see a wall-o-hot dogs.  You will clearly see why you want one of these awesome dogs.  If it's your first time, get a regular dog, and a super dog, pack on the mustard and onions.   Ketchup if you like, (I'm a Chicago purest, so none of that for me), your favorite soda, I recommend a coke, and order some fires.  This should fill you up nicely, and if you want more, then good luck, portions are large. 
There are seats in sight, or you can find the additional seating past the \"O\".  Cash is king, makes things easier, and know what you want on it (toppings), to speed you along."}
{"text":"Parking is tough to get here so I don't get to go much. I also get a little cautious sometimes as they frequently have multiple questionable looking characters.

Pro's:
- Legendary fries that used to be super huge and gave you great value for your buck
- Good burgers
- If you drink, it looks like they have a lot of different kinds of alcohol

Con's:
- Customer Service? Hahaha. Not here. If you can get more than a fart out of one of the twin's working there, you are ahead of the pack.
- Dirty, messy tables, crap everywhere.
- Many questionable characters here. Someone once asked me if I wanted to buy stolen jewelry off them while I was eating. I'm being totally honest too.
- Their french fry portions have gotten smaller. They used to need two baskets for a large fry and now only need one.
- Really expensive hot dogs. 
- They have strict limits on ketchup. No I'm not joking. 2 for large fries, 1 for anything less.

I do recommend getting their legendary fries at least once and I do recommend the egg burger, but get it to go and go when it is light out."}
{"text":"If you've been there then you know. Visited many of times through my life and finally want to share a review. Prices are fair for a dog shop, fries are the real attraction if your looking for them greasy taters. Sure there is a compitater on the same block but who cares about atmosphere. Dirty O will always take the cake in that category. Glad they cleaned up the bathrooms a bit because that was a dungeon you didn't want to enter.
So grab a small fry to share with a party of 3, a sixer or some 40's, and sit and enjoy the wonders of Oakland."}
{"text":"Ahh the \"Dirty O.\" Actually not so dirty in recent years. An Oakland Institution. Hot Dogs are the absolute best in town. This is a longtime busy city joint. Not much has changed since coming here as a kid. Night time it gets a little rowdy with drunks but daytime its a great place for one of the worlds best hotdogs and fries. Those frys.....oh those fries. They are like the godfathers of the fresh cut french fries. The portions are so big they are almost offensive. Perfectly cooked everytime they literally have it down to a science. They're sandwhiches and pizza are pretty good also. Something for everyone there! Hope to see this longtime pillar of the neighborhood survive another 50 years!"}
{"text":"The O is a staple for Oakland and Pittsburgh. My son's fist time experiencing it this afternoon. Loved the hot dogs and fries. Will make this a tradition for him as it was for me growing up."}
{"text":"This place is not the cleanest, but I can't resist their food especially their fries with cheese and white pizza! As expected, everything is a bit on the greasy side, but that's just how we like it! They have a great selection of beer as well."}
{"text":"Too often is the term \"instituition\" used when describing an eatery.  Too seldom is that term used to describe \"The O\".  If you're looking to feed an army of hungry college students then this is absolutely the place to go.  What can one get at \"The O\"?  Well, try delightfully greasy pizza, thick hard hot dogs. triple thick milk shakes, and a mountain of french fries so large you almost need a wheelbarrow to carry them.  God only knows how many weekend afternoon hangovers I drowned in a sea of french fry grease, ketchup, and cheese.

The place has the right amount of dirty to make a hungover college student feel at home.

To visit Pittsburgh more than twice and not go to The O is a tragedy.  But some advice, go in the afternoon or early evening.  Late nights are very busy and sometimes the place is frequented by some unsavory characters."}
{"text":"Ok this is a fast food joint. You go here for fast food. Not service. Cheap quick food. Fries are the best. Large fries will feed 3 guys. It was called the dirty O for the longest time for a reason. The fries are gluten free. Some of the staff have been there since I was a kid. If you want good service with a smile go else where. This is good cheap fast food."}
{"text":"Came here after a semi-get together with family and friends. They told me about this place being bomb after a party and how it was good food. The outside lights made it very festive. The inside was just nice and what you would expect from a hot dog shop/diner type of setup. 
I got the superdog which is jammed with stuff if you get everything on it. Now it wasnt spectacular but it wasnt bad. Now what sends this place over the top are the fries. They basically give you a massive amount, that cannot be finished unless your with friends or your last name is kobayashi. 
Overall I thought it was great and I wouldnt mind coming back to try other stuff. Also if im hungry or a poor college kid or just hit with the munchies I would come here just for the fries."}
{"text":"Loved the dogs in their natural casing, which have real snap. Plain with brown mustard, yum!

Fries were very good.  The small size was still too large for the two of us, and we couldn't eat them all.

Not very clean, or at least it doesn't feel clean, especially the bathroom.

Huge selection of bottled beer."}
{"text":"A flat-out dive, the Original has been on something like a dozen Travel Channel/Discovery/PBS/Food Network shows because it does two things very, very well: Hot dogs and french fries. Sure, there's pizza and subs and such but why would you chose those over the superb dogs and taters. 

The fries are legendary: tasty as hell and absolutely huge servings. Amazingly large. Shit-ton large. Order a small unless you're sharing. Period.

The dogs are really good, with a great variety of toppings and other variations. Just great.

So, if I like it so much why the missing star? One word: dirt. It's known as \"The Dirty O\" and that's a well-earned name. There's a decades old patina of cooking grease on everything, and while I don't have a problem with it, chances are someone in your party will and will make an issue of it. But if you can get past that (and keep your food on your tray) it's a five-star place."}
{"text":"when it's 130am, who cares about the nitty-gritty?

boisterous beings inside but fast and efficient service gets you in and out before you can count how many drinks you (think you) had.

i happened to come here late last saturday night when i *wasn't* intoxicated, and was pleasantly surprised at the relatively low douche factor. the bestie and i picked up a couple dogs and fries to go.

when we got back to the crib, i opened my hot dog container. the bun was still moist from the steaming process, and the ends of the dog came out from both sides..just how i like it*. i got ketchup, mustard, onions, and pickles. not the best dog i've ever had but hey, i'm from chicago. it was sufficient.

the enormous mound of fries were made fresh for us (hellll-o** to the cutie helping us in the pirates hat) and were still hot when we got home. good, not great, and i was kind of disappointed that a good number of the taters were the bottom, stumpy, runt bits. the giant sealed container of ketchup was pretty clutch, though. oh to be where heinz started. open 24/7 and cash only!

{"text":"This place has been around 4EVER. You don't come here for customer service, you come to eat, people watch a little and enjoy your friends. This is college town greasy and cheap food. The sandwiches, pizza, fries and hot dogs are good. 

It is what it is...Long live the O!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this hot dog to blow me away with taste, but it kind of fell short. It's just your typical dive place that specializes in not just hot dogs, but sandwiches and pizza, too. They don't have fountain drinks, so when you order a drink you're actually getting a bottled drink. There's seating on the pizza side as well as upstairs from where the hot dogs are ordered. The \"small\" is anything but small, which was probably the best part of the experience. They were well salted and made to order, so they were pretty crispy! Will I come back for another? Probably not, but it was nice to know that I wasn't exactly missing much during my time in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I am a huge French fry fanatic, so it means a lot when I say this. The O has my favorite cheese fries ever."}
{"text":"Tried the famous fries, supposedly the best in the country. Tasted like any other fries. And the guy selling them COULD NOT GIVE A FUCK about his job. One of the grumpiest, most unfriendly guys I ever bought food from."}
{"text":"The stuff legends are made of. The hot dogs are great, no doubt. But the mountain of fries has to be seen to be believed. Of course, seeing them isn't good enough... they must be devoured.

I appreciate this place for its personality as much as its food.

They just don't make 'em like this anymore..."}
{"text":"YESSSS the Dirty O! Yes, the floors are sticky and the bathrooms are nightmarish. Yes, the people are surly. But who cares! You really won't find better fries anywhere. When you walk in, walk immediately past the hot dog counter (they're okay but not important) back to the fry counter. If you are with 3 or fewer people, get a small--it'll be more than enough. I'd come in with a group of seven and get a medium (\"serves 3-4\") and it was always MORE than enough. Purists will claim you don't need anything but salt on the fries, but I always liked that ersatz cheese sauce. It lent just a touch of class to the whole experience. It's basically the same thing as a Mornay, yo!

And the fries? Hot, crispy, fluffy on the inside, glistening with oil that burns your tongue when you put it in your mouth. The oil probably hasn't been changed since 1974, but that's part of the charm. Anyone who's anyone knows these fries are where it's at. Forget Five Guys, screw Point Brugge--this is the true Pittsburgh potato-based food experience.

DO NOT GET THE PIZZA WHATEVER YOU DO. I DON'T CARE HOW DRUNK YOU ARE. You always hear stories of various heinous crimes happening here late at night, but I've never known anyone who's ever had anything happen to them personally--it's always something that happened to a guy a friend of a friend's cousin knows, or you read about them happening at some ungodly hour of the night in the Post-Gazette. Don't let that scare you off! This is a Pittsburgh institution and for good reason.

Oh, also I saw Dan Marino here one time and didn't recognize him and everyone made fun of me. The end."}
{"text":"Great place to stand at counter and be ignored by staff. Want anything? Wait till commercial break."}
{"text":"I've decided to go with 'middle' 3 stars for two reasons:

1) The steak pizza is probably the best I've had, especially if you have late night munchies it is absolutely mouth-watering.

2) I know multiple people and have various stories about gunshots, and other shady things that occur here so that kind of knocks down the pizza a bit if you're fearing for your life.

Is it worth it? Go in the daylight or if you're real brave, at night with pepper spray, a posse of friends, & running shoes."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in the area we stop here for the French fries. Yes, the French fries! The small (which is recommended for 2 - 3 people) can easily feed that many or more.

We usually get the Buy One Get One offer on hot dogs (one for each of us) and split the fries as the main course. These fries are so good because they are double-fried."}
{"text":"I dont really get the ravibgs are about the fries here.. Pretty meh to my opinion. Like it's not that crunchy and you cqn literally see thousands grain of salt in of strip of fries... However, the portion is really big, even a small order could feed two people heartily. Oh and dont eat the onion rings. Theyre too heavily breaded and bland."}
{"text":"Ate there recently for the first time in over a third of a century. Back in the day (1975-1979) I often had the small square burgers and sometimes the bucket of fries on the way back from the library to the dorm at night, sooo good. Also would pick up a six-pack of Stroh's beer. Well, the little 55 cent burgers and the Stroh's beer are long gone, but the fries remain, and are as delicious and greasy as ever. 

Back in the day they served the fries in properly proportioned containers--now they put a little paper container on a tray and dump a huge quantity of fries over the entire tray. I wonder when this started and why? A medium was a full meal for 4 people! Well worth it when I periodically visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Why can't I quit you? With your delicious, crunchy fries and cheese and gravy dipping sauces? I heart you and have since college.  Ask them to sprinkle garlic salt on your hot fries too - you have to pay (not much) for the cheese and gravy but dip it first in the cheese (sticks better) THEN the gravy - yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"Great Hot Dog joint in the Pitt University section of Pittsburgh. The hot dogs here have that old fashion taste, and the fries are amazing! It's cool to see an old joint like this still operating, and keeping the original character it's always had. A great place to stop and grab a chili cheese dog while in the area. A must stop while in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Horrible! We were excited to eat here because of the name. However, the hot dogs were dried out and disgusting, buns were dry, and there are no refills on soda. I would suggest walking a couple of doors down to the burger joint."}
{"text":"\"Awww yeah!\" as Marky Mark would have said back in the day if he had tasted my hot dog.  I got the beef dog with cheese, chilli, onions, sauerkraut and mustard.  The wait was a little long because there were two people ahead of us ordering HUGE orders so we kind of stood idle for a good 30 minutes but I was assured, these were gonna be good. I was not disappointed.

Now, let's talk about the fries. WOW.  We got a small and this could easily feed 4 people. HUGE portions.  They do not skimp here and the price is right.

My one pet peeve:  why two different lines for hot dogs and fries?  Can I just order both at the same time at the same window?  Doesn't make a bit of sense to me to pay for my hot dog then have to walk over to the other side of the restaurant to order and pay for my fries?  By the time i get the fries, my damn dog will be cold!  Let's see if we can come up with a more efficient procedure?  I am all for the old-school but this was just plain retarded.

Despite this, I really enjoyed my hot dog and would go back. My belly is growling just thinking of it."}
{"text":"While on a Business trip to Pittsburgh I got to mark off my 4th Hot Dog restaurant that was featured on the PBS \"A Hot Dog Show\" 
( The previous 3 = Skin Thrasher's - Anderson, SC, Pinks, LA,Ca, American Coney Island.).

 Lets just say that Pinks has nothing to worry about being Dethroned from #1 in my world. I went in on a Wednesday around 11am'ish and there was maybe 5 other people in the place already eating and I was the only one at the ordering counter and  ordered the All Beef wt onion, Chili & cheese and paid -$5.96, and at a separate counter ordered a Small order of fries wt Cheese Sauce on the side paying again -$5.92 for a Total of $11.88. Its a weird set up they have going paying at each counter but I guess there is a method to their madness and whatever works for them.

The Hot Dog did have a snap to it as advertised but it was overall just another Hot Dog and nothing special. The French fries did live up to its \"as advertized\" HUGE portion but over all I wasnt impressed with them considering some of the reviewers here saying they were the \"Best they have ever had\". The fries didnt even come close to the fries we made getting out of school in the 9th Grade and going over to my neighbors house and making fries in the \"Fry Daddy\" (Remember THAT sweet appliance?) We use to make them thick Steak House cut, Medium & thin cut and damn we had that shit down!! Now those were the BEST fries I have ever had.

So overall I say: Over priced & over rated Nationally. I dont know what the competition is locally in Pittsburgh so I'm not going to shoot anyone down in flames or step on any toes and I'll leave that to what the locals have to say here & as featured on \"A Hot Dog Show\"."}
{"text":"I'm a hotdog guy... The ambiance was fitting for the experience. I thought the hotdog was very good... I had the superdog (hotdog, bacon, & cheese) the bacon got in the way of the beef hotdog BUT I finished it ALL none the less... What I LovED was the fries!!! Massive amount of fries! I had a party of 3 so I got the medium... It was WAY more Han we could eat! The cheese with the fries made it superb!

I will go back next time in Pittsburg!"}
{"text":"The O is like that dinner that you get every year for your birthday.  You know what you are getting and it will probably be a gluttonous amount of food.  The only thing is that you probably aren't paying for that dinner.

Let's face it:  The O is good, but pretty expensive.  I got a chili cheese dog at a $6 price tag.  That's a little steep.  The hot dogs are consistently good and the fry portions are massive.  It is a Pittsburgh experience, check it out, early or late night."}
{"text":"Must visit spot in Pittsburgh.  I have been coming to this place since I was little.  Every time I come home I have to get a hot and cheese fries.  The fries are so hot and crispy.  They have all different types of topping for the dogs but my favorite is sauerkraut, spicy mustard and pickles. Try next time you visit the Burgh!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for hotdogs. Not meeting expectation even adding with cheese. Not a place to chat or study. Not considering coming back again, I would rather have burgers or hotdogs at five guys."}
{"text":"I see a lot of people have reviewed this place. Well here is my 2 cents. There food is sloop it's the kind of thing I would expect to be served to college kids on  a budget. 

I had a hot sausage sandwhich the bread was hard enough to cut a person's gums the sauce  tasted like ragu straight out of a jar and the hot sausage was under cooked!!! who does that? Yep this is a place to be avoided."}
{"text":"Growing up in Pittsburgh, I heard a lot about The O but never went in due to the bad rep it got from some violent late-nite incidents that happened there. Walked in on a sunny, safe day (& noticing the black-globe security cams), I got a large to-go order of fries & man, the bag weighed a ton. I felt like I won the lotto walking out with that bag & got a lot of knowing 'Mmmm, theee Oooooh' looks from people on the street who saw me cradling that hot oily bag like a big healthy baby in my arms. Could not wait till I got home so I sat on a bench & had my 1st taste & It Lived Up To Its Hype. Crisp warm golden mealy deliciousness with just enough oil & salt to keep you finger-lickin' happy. Fries came w/ 2 small ketchup bins (free) & 1 small cheese bin ($1.84). Was disappointed with the condiments especially the cheese...$1.84 for a small bin of Cheez-Wiz when you've given me all these fries?!?! (I've always wondered how they make a profit giving you so much food, now I know it's made from the cheese.) Does not compute, but I made do with what I had & the fries lasted 2 days & even tasted better cold. I eat a lot of Los (LocalOrganicSustainable) Hipster food & I'll take The Dirty O over those ironic pretentious twats with great stylists-publicists-social media strategists any day of the week. Needless to say, I will be back.

The O is everything great about Pittsburgh. Don't overthink it, just do it: Go to The O, consume mass quantities, & fall in love with Pittsburgh again for the very first time."}
{"text":"as a pittsburgh transplant, I've generally been pretty disappointed with the  quality of restaurants. I've found that your best bet is to steer clear of the fine dining and outmoded \"hot spots\", and go straight for the junk food. the \"O\" has lovely hot dogs with a snappy natural casing. I get mine w/ brown mustard & kraut. Their fries come in generous proportions (I recommend the small for two people), and are generally crispy and fresh. Plus, they have a pretty good beer selection, which puts this place heads and shoulders above, say D's, whose sysco-truck curly fries and mushy dogs are just pathetic."}
{"text":"I know I'm supposed to like the O and that it's a tradition, but honestly, the food is not all that good.  I like the fries, they are better than average, and the portions are huge.  My cheesesteak sandwich was not even average, and the portion of meat was very skimpy."}
{"text":"There's something about a hot dog that can make any person's day better.  Does that sound corny, heck if I care.

The O is one of those Pittsburgh things, one part mythical and one part mandatory.  It is one of those places that any and all Pittsburgher should try at least once before moving on.  Believe it or not, this is only my second time trying this place and I've lived and worked in the Burgh for over ten years now.  People are always complaining about how this place has a negative appeal, I just don't see it.  You may have some bad things happen here, but that can happen at any business in any part of the city.

The hot dogs them self are amazing.  So many different ways to have them topped.  And, they are cooked fresh right in front of you.  They are first cooked on the griddle and then right before they toss them in the bun to be topped to your liking, they put them on a grill to give them that char mark and a little bit of crispiness.  Biting into one of these masterpieces is close to heaven.  Once you bite through that casing, it's like full flavor in your mouth.  My latest visit I just opted for the boring (yet tasty) ketchup, mustard and onion on my dog.  I'm happy I opted for it this way.  The flavor combination above did not over power the dog.

I also got some of their fresh cut fries, a small, not that colossal fry that I knew I'd be eating for three days and they were just as good.  A note to people, they ask if you want salt on them instead of just putting it on there.  So for all those health conscious, low sodium eaters out there, that solves it for you.

A few other notes on this place.  They accept credit cards instead of being a cash only establishment.  There is extra seating on other floors.  There is a walk up window for the warmer months.  Limited bar experience here as well.  Six packs to go.

Enjoy your dog here, or take it to go.  It is truly a one of a kind Pittsburgh experience."}
{"text":"A must-visit, but their pizza is awful, their hot dogs are tasteless, and their fries are- well- fries.  A tip for the newbie:  If you order a small fries, they use a small cup to fill up a brown bag of fries, and turn the cup upside down on the whole thing.  If you order a large, they do the same with a large cup (filling up the same size bag), for a larger price. :)"}
{"text":"insanely good fries, real good hot dogs.  great place to get a late night twelve pack or some 40s.  After Superbowl XL my buddy kept buying 40s and immediately dropping them outside during the revelry.  Never once did he get hassled."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh institution.  Great snap dogs grilled to perfection.  Have the chilli as a free topping.  The pizza here is great and greasy.  If you like fresh fries this is your place.  The large can feed a family of 6.  If your in Oakland this is most stop."}
{"text":"I was taken here because it's one of those local establishments that you have to go to. I liked how they set up different counters to order different foods. I went with a hot dog and a draft beer, nothing special on either end. Place is divey and old but you're not going there for the atmosphere but rather cheap food and beer (that really isn't that cheap)."}
{"text":"Came here because my father raved about it only to be hosted by Joanne who was a complete b***** to me for no reason when I was trying to add hot peppers to my order that was already placed which I was completely willing to pay for. Not coming back. Servers suck."}
{"text":"Cons...bathrooms are worse than any in the city...staff probably hates you (I have been flipped off and sworn at while eating here)...must order different items at different counters...must muscle way to front of line or you never get to order...clean tables is an oxymoron.  
Pros...you can't get this experience anywhere else...I have never heard of anyone getting sick from eating here...there is a nice place next door that lets you use their bathroom if you act like you are gonna order food there...the fries are simply the best on the planet.  I have actually been on diets in the past and refused to eat for two straight days just so I could justify a trip to the 'o'.  Be sure to go about the same time the local bars are closing...the 'show' is worth four stars all by itself.  
Cons= -5 stars....fries=+10 stars....nets out at five stars."}
{"text":"Geez, what a bunch of cranky reviewers... The system is really not that complicated, just pay some attention to how the place is laid out. What do you people think this is, McDonald's?

1) Order the fries. 
2) Walk over to the hot dogs and order (mustard, kraut and onions, of course). 
3) Walk back to the the fries section. Your order just came up!  Optional: Stop for a beer on the way.

By the way, don't get too focused on the hot dogs. Try the hoagies in the back. These are the best in the city, as near as I can tell. And this seems to be the only place in town that actually makes real French (i.e. Belgian) fries."}
{"text":"this is an indoor hotdog stand that basically sells fries.  If you misunderstand this and expect a place to study (you can, and I have on slow times), you will be unhappy.  if you order their exotic dishes, then you will be disappointed.  if you get a hotdog, get a good one, like an all-beaf. Also, they can miss things sometimes.  But, splitting a fries with a friend here, priceless.  And, do, if you are hungry, go on, get a large.  they are expensive, but if you are hungry you can finish it.  worth a detour from the highway to try it.   Locals also tell you, if there is fight, they tend to not bother the tourists or students!"}
{"text":"It's important for me to note at the beginning of this review that I don't like french fries.  There are two exceptions to this rule - McDonalds and The O in Pittsburgh.  And even if I'm eating there, I don't usually get the fries at McD.  But everytime I am in Pittsburgh, I will get the fries at The O.  Every.  Time.  They give you a ridiculous amount and just pony up for the cheese and gravy on the side.  YUMMMMMMM.  Crunchy outside, potatoey inside and plenty of salt.  Rock on."}
{"text":"Terrible. Nothing unique or interesting about it. This place might have been impressive 50 years ago when there was nothing else to eat in Pittsburgh, but nowadays it's just boring, overpriced, and well past its expiration date. But if you like the taste of grease and canned cheese sauce, you'll love it. 

On any given Saturday night, you'll often see greasy brown half-full bags of fries littered around Forbes Ave. These are the leftovers of drunk kids who got scammed into buying a laughably excessive order of fries when all they wanted was a handful to go with their hot dog. \"Quantity over quality\" and \"waste for the sake of waste\" seem to be time-honored traditions among Baby-Boomers around these parts, but anyone born after 1980 will likely be more disgusted than impressed.

The visible contempt they have for their customers is not at all charming like it is at a place like The Wiener's Circle in Chicago or other old-school dives wit genuine character; it's just alienating and sad. The O belongs to a class of old-guard Pittsburgh eateries that should have folded years ago, but is kept on life-support by a handful of deluded old yinzers who refuse to change with the times. Skip it."}
{"text":"I knew I'd make it here one day and last Saturday, during a tour of the Pitt campus, I was provided the perfect opportunity to pop in and give this place a try without going out of my way.  And I'll say it...I'm glad I didn't cross the Birmingham Bridge just  for this.  Still, something about it is charming and authentic and well, original.  And the food wasn't allll bad.  

First the good:  The fries were plentiful and amazing.  I realize they probably never change the frying oil but I'm sure that's exactly what makes them so tasty.  And the gravy...get the gravy!!  It elevates the fry experience to a whole new level.   Also tried these fries with cheese; plain ol' ketchup; and bare naked.  Delicious any way you go.  

The disgusting: The hot dog.  I'm sorry but I don't get the hype.  I like my hot dogs plump, juicy and preferably all-beef.  This was shriveled, crunchy, crusty, overcooked, and well...I don't know what's in a hot dog but it wasn't all beef.  I realized after ordering that you can in fact order an all-beef dog, but that leads me to the next point....

The confusing:  I know this is part of the charm and what makes this place an \"institution\" in Pittsburgh and a gripe from a newcomer is worth about a penny, but wow.  The menu is super busy and all over the place...leading me to miss the all-beef dog option. And I had absolutely no idea where to physically place my order (dogs in one section, fries in another, beer/pizza in another!!!).  Fortunately it was mid afternoon, not too crowded, and a polite kid behind the counter had a surprising amount of patience with me.  

If for no other reason than a six pack of beer, I'm sure I'll be back at some point during my time as a part-time Pitt student."}
{"text":"The O is a Pittsburgh institution.  At one time, it apparently sold reasonably priced hot dogs, burgers, and fries.  Now, they are banking on nostalgic alumni and reputation versus being cheap, but the dogs are still good.

My friend and I stopped in after a Wednesday night class for a quick hot dog.  People swear by the fries, but as a non-fry eater, I think they are edible and nothing more.  I ordered a cheese dog with jalapenos ($5.34 w tax).  The cheese dog is good, but in New York I can get two cheese dogs and a drink for $5.  The quality and price just don't match up.

Try it once if you want to see what the fuss is about, but it's not really somewhere I feel the need to come back to.  The help leaves something to be desired, and the place is super grungy.  However, the O does take credit cards now!"}
{"text":"I give them kudos for using hotdogs in their natural casings and more natural ingredients so to speak, but as for taste, the shop is a bit overrated for its hype and name. The toppings are nice, the dogs are a bit salty. Everything else is pretty standard as well...milkshakes a bit too sweet for my taste and the fries are ordinary. Worth a try if you're curious to see what all the hype about, but at least for me, will not become one of my regular lunch stops."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to the O for a Saturday lunch. It was fairly busy and the thing that stood out the most was how miserable each employee was. I witnessed employees talking rudely to each other and customers, eye rolls included. To me, the ambiance of a place is just as important as the food. I don't see the charm in rushing your customers to order. 

There is a counter to order hot dogs and then a separate counter for sandwiches and fries, so it's hard to time your food if you're getting different things. My boyfriend's hot dog was ready at least 8-10 minutes before my burger and fries. He said it was one of the best hot dogs he's ever had, while I was not nearly as impressed with my burger. Overpriced and overcooked beef with an overcooked egg was very disappointing. 

The best part of the meal was the fries, they were delicious!!! Although the sign about being charged for any extra ketchup requested just added to the unfriendly vibe of the place. I'd try it again late night when nothing better is open."}
{"text":"Forty years of classic hot dogs and mammoth buckets of fries."}
{"text":"Every city has its share of restaurants that are beloved by locals so much that they become institutions.  The quality of the food is often irrelevant, as locals will come to swear by the restaurant and proclaim its greatness over every city's equivalent.  The Original Hot Dog Shop in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh is a prime example of this type of restaurant.

The hot dogs are above average, but by no means achieve the level of greatness proclaimed by alums of the University of Pittsburgh.  They have a nice grilled taste and feature good quality meat, but there is nothing terribly unique about the hot dogs . The choice of toppings is limited, and the hot dogs have a standard taste, but the quality is solid.

What makes the Original Hot Dog Shop stand out is its french fries.  The fries are fried to order, and after a short time spent in the fryer, a quick dash of salt is tossed on the fries.  The portion size is beyond generous, as a small order could easily serve as a full meal for two diners, and the fries have a crunchy exterior with a soft middle.  The level of saltiness is perfect, and though ketchup is given with the fries, it is not needed, as the fries are so full of flavor that toppings are not needed.

You won't find anything new at the Original Hot Dog Shop, but it's a good local joint with solid hot dogs and exceptional french fries."}
{"text":"All you need to know is that The O has the best fries you will ever eat. You get a ton even with a small, and they go best with the cheese sauce. The cheese sauce is a few bucks but totally worth it. The only other thing I've tried here is the pizza, which is not best (rather soggy)."}
{"text":"Can't beat the dirty \"O.\" There is no other place to go when its 2 am and you are dying for a trayful of fries. Gotta love their hot dogs too which are the best in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I can't really count on one hand the number of times that Bobby & I decided to just head to The O for fries for dinner. (yes, just fries; well plus cheese & gravy). You'd think that this rating would be higher, but ah I just cant seem to do it.

I will say though, that you should try the fries atleast once. Any time a friend from out of town heads to my place in Oakland, we usually head to The O. (normally it's their choice) So yes, the fries are great, but it kind of stops there. The other pros are the numerous bottles of beer, the retro atmosphere & the hours.

The one thing that bothers me is the crappy attitudes from the employees. Yes, the team that's working is normally semi-friendly, but there is ALWAYS that bad apple that is just so darn rude & hates her life + the world! ahh i can't handle it! Especially I'm handing over a $20+ just for the basics.  For example, we headed here this weekend with a 3 year old. My sister ordered her an all-beef hot dog with chili+cheese..... $6 (!!) for a flipping chili cheese hot dog!! Insane. & it's not like it's the best tasting hot dog or this giant, plump thing.. & the chili is completely tasteless 

My sister & Bobby split a sub and all 4 of us split a giant wad of fries.. Everyone kept asking why I wasn't getting any food and the answer is: I only come to The O for the fries. 

Oh,the creepy, smelly bathrooms also make em lose a star. 

Come for the fries and the experience, but don't set your expectations too high."}
{"text":"The fries are good. The \"signature\" fries are reeeeeally good. 

However, I have to dock them for 
a) making it needlessly confusing to figure out where to buy normal fries and where to buy signature fries, and then acting surly when I didn't immediately understand the difference (yes, I'm sure it's part of their shtick, but have some patience with the kid obviously from out of town with no one behind him)
b) not having terribly good hot dogs (sorry, but they ain't no Nathan's), and
c) charging a large amount for an absurd amount of fries without having any clear option to pay a normal amount of fries for a normal price (luckily I brought someone who could share them with me.) 

That said, the fries were reeeeeeeeally good. I'm sure I'll be back. Damnit.

[Edit - They do have a better option for ordering an smaller number of fries. Actually, I think they give you basically the same, insanely large amount of fries, but just charge you less for some reason. Either way, they're getting a star back, as the place is growing on me. ]"}
{"text":"The O. A staple for Pitt and CMU students. If you want fries, do not order the large fries. Order the small fries because you will still not be able to finish them. They completely load up your tray with fries. The hot dogs are not bad. They are sometimes overcooked or are just old. And the fries aren't really good either.

However, this place is open 24 hours and they do serve/sell beer too which is really good because if you're at Hemmingways when they close, you can just roll next door and get some drunk munchies. Just don't order the large fries."}
{"text":"Serious fun. A dirty little location that normally only locals would go to but with tv spreading the word, we can all enjoy.

Fries are good. If you are going just order the large for fun. It's not that much money but you will remember it.

Cash only."}
{"text":"I've been here once to eat (over a year ago) and two weeks ago to pick up a six pack of Mike's.  I would have never thought to come here for a six pack, but needing to get one for a party and having read that many beer distributors don't sell them (gah, PA liquor laws), I asked my labmate where I could pick one up, and she suggested the O.  Of course, I forgot the cash only policy (under $10 orders), so I had to run around to find a functional ATM (the one on Forbes was out of service).  Normally, this wouldn't be a problem for me, since I usually carry some cash, but having just returned from a trip, I was fresh out.  Ten minutes of running around later, I was able to purchase my Mike's and be on my way.

When I ate in, I came here for dinner with a couple of friends on a Fri. night around 6:30.  One of my friends suggested it, since he'd heard that CNN rated their french fries as some of the best in the country.  We ordered a medium order of fries, and there were plenty enough for all three of us to share with no problem.  Although I don't know if I'd concur with CNN's verdict, they were definitely some of the best thin-cut fries I've had in PGH, speaking as someone who doesn't usually care much for thin-cut fries (for thick-cut fries, I recommend the Pub Chip Shop).  We also ordered the cheese sauce and the gravy dips to go with the fries (note: they charged for all of them), and although the cheese sauce went with them well (it's your typical Velveeta-type cheese fry dip), I was underwhelmed by the gravy, which I found salty and greasy.  In addition to the fries, I ordered a chicken gyro, which was dry and flavorless, and a chocolate milkshake, which was thick and delicious.  I can't comment on the hot dogs, since I don't eat beef, so I'll have to defer to other reviewers for that.  If I come back, I think I'll just get the fries and the milkshake, and maybe try dipping the fries in the milkshake, Frosty-style.

The atmosphere is grungy, so don't expect it to be the cleanest place you've ever eaten.   Service was curt when I ordered dinner, but was okay more recently.  Although I haven't been here late at night, I understand that they charge a premium for the food at that hour to subsidize the rent-a-cop that they keep on hand to avoid brawling between drunk customers.  It's worth trying once, but I don't know that I'll be back unless I have a craving for fries or am looking for late night eats."}
{"text":"I have heard about the O since before I moved to Pittsburgh and finally tried it last week.  It was exactly as I expected it would be in terms of menu and \"decor\".  I was, however, impressed with the wide variety of options available on their menu.  Yes, they had the standard hot dog options, pizzas, subs and hoagies.  What was nice is that each different type of food was ordered and prepared in a separate area, so lines moved quickly.  We stuck with the hot dog section and each had a hot dog, got one order of fries and an order of chicken fingers.  When they tell you a small order of fries serves two, they aren't kidding.  The basket was overflowing with perfectly seasoned fries with just the right amount of crisp.  

I have come to the conclusion that I prefer the standard \"not sure what is actually in it\" hot dog taste to that of the all beef, high quality dogs.  Not a knock against the O, it just made me enjoy my fries and chicken fingers more than the hot dog itself.  I did, however, love the chicken fingers.  Great flavor, moist and just the right amount of breading.  The downside for this Buffalonian is that they do not have blue cheese, so I just dipped them in hot sauce instead.  

I had no idea that the O served alcohol, so it was a surprise to see not only a selection of tap beers, but also a cooler that wrapped around the restaurant with everything from Boones Farm to high end microbrews.  

I'm glad I went and experienced their \"famous\" fries and enjoyed my food and experience.  However, I probably won't be back until the next time I am really craving greasy, late night type food."}
{"text":"Like Primanti's nearby, the history of this place helps keep it going, but if it weren't for that I wouldn't think much of it. A ton of beer selections plus your standard bar food, although this place isn't so much a bar as it is a dive as well as beer distributor. The ambiance and service of this place leave much to be desired (we contend that we were overcharged on more than one occasion here), but the food isn't bad. Their hot dogs are indeed quite good, grilled almost perfectly, and of course there are the fries. These come in huge servings and are quite possibly among the best in Oakland (though I would probably choose Uncle Sam's thinner cut fries if I had to)."}
{"text":"Sorry, don't like this place. Prices are high for what you're getting, and hotdogs are crappy quality. It's \"all american\" but not in the good way. Fries are overly salty and overall quite flavourless. Been here a few times with friends, and I'm usually not too picky about eating with friends (other places around are fine) but I actively ask them to not go to this place, even though I'm fine with nearly anything else in Oakland."}
{"text":"A less-than-hygienic caricature of George Costanza worked the grill. Upset that he was carried to term, he directed me to the back of the dive to order fries, something seemingly impossible to do from the main counter, despite the fact that they were also being cooked there at the time. 

The hot dog was a shriveled mess--a circumcised member that spent too much time in a swimming pool, which could explain George's disgruntled demeanor. 

The fries were hailed as one of the \"best french fries in the U.S.\" by CNN's Laura Kiniry--I can only assume that continence must be her strong suit. The fries were bland, starchy and undercooked; better fries can be found at Butter Joint, Winghart's, and every single other restaurant that I've been to in Pittsburgh that serves them. Those that voted these fries as Pittsburgh Magazine's \"best of\" are of niggardly sensibility.

The milk shake was vanilla and fine."}
{"text":"The O is known for their sarcastic staff and their fries and hotdogs. I also love their veggie subs and portabella burger. I owe all my \"freshmen 15\" to the O."}
{"text":"First time checking out this \"Pittsburgh institution\" and I can honestly say I left disappointed. First, the ordering process is more difficult than necessary. Hot dogs and side of fries at one counter, hamburgers and \"shareable\" fries at another. Just streamline the process... The staff appeared to be absolutely miserable and were completely devoid of personality. The prices are high for a hot dog place ($18 for 2 hotdogs and 2 fries). I ordered cheese on the hotdogs as I was unaware that this would mean they literally put a piece of American cheese on top (gross) when I was expecting a cheese sauce of some sort. The hot dogs did have a nice snap, but they were dry and I only had 3 bites before I couldn't tolerate it. The two stars are strictly for the fries, which were very good. I'm not sure I would return to an establishment with such terrible service just for fries, though."}
{"text":"Best fries in Pittsburgh; the portions are huge - a small order of fries can easily serve two people. I usually get the cheese sauce with the fries - mmm so good! They also have amazing all beef foot long hot dogs!"}
{"text":"This place was the second place that came to mind when reminiscing about places that actually made me who I am today The O came to mind. If I had a dollar today for every hot dog I have consumed from this place I would be able to retire early. The hot dogs with their crispy skin and the french fries are something worth remembering."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the ridiculous amount I paid ($43+ and $3 parking) for 6 hot dogs, french fries and 4 20oz bottles of pop. The service was abysmal, no organization at all, no personality and no customer skills whatsoever.. Order and pay for hot dogs from one counter and order and pay for french fries from another. This results in something being served cold while you walk over and order the other item and wait on it with the first hot item. No questions other than yellow or brown mustard. Signage was so cluttered and no prices by the hot dog counter left you basically at their greedy whim to charge you \"whatever\". Drinks are under lock and key, literally, they have locks on the soda cooler doors. Might have been the spot in the past but just a dumpy, dirty, overpriced, poorly run, poorly organized money maker for someone. Never again I can guarantee that."}
{"text":"the service is really slow, the people aren't pleasant and the restaurant layout is overall very confusing. the food wasn't anything to write home about and nothing really stood out in the meal. the hot dogs were ok and i appreciate how long the establishment has been there but i wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"This is the best greasy spoon for me. Every time I travel back home to the burgh I have to get my O fries. Get the large and some cheese. Friendliness of the staff could be better but who cares. This place is all about the French Fries."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a dog and a beer on a recent weekend trip to PGH.

The \"O\" is a local institution that's worth checking out once, but that's about it. The hot dogs are the star of the show, and they are nothing special. I'd been before, and as I bit into my dog on this trip, I immediately realized that once was enough.

The draw of the \"O\" is that it's open til 3:30am. So if I'm staying in Oaktown, drunk and hungry after the bars close, I'd stop in for some grub. Other than that, though, I don't see me returning."}
{"text":"Sure, there are questionable crowds of people at any time of day and the floors are greasy, but all that sure doesn't matter after you've had their wing dings, fries, and the chicken parm sandwich.

This place contributed to my Freshman 15, and it's probably a godsend it's not on CMU campus anymore."}
{"text":"They sell Hot Dogs...
please take note:  this place is more of a college town culture experiment than a fabulous gourmet eatery!
Please know that going in!!

I've seen too many people write reviews for this joint as if it were supposed to be selling some gourment goodness.
Its not; its just unique.

PROS: 
interesting looking 
uniquely operated
gives you a taste of college town & the camaraderie that comes with that

CONS:
seemingly not very clean
pricey for \"just hotdogs\" and french fries with warmed cheese whiz
Parking (as always in Oakland) is poo!


PARKING TIP:  If the street parking fails you... try the lot across the street in the lower level Pitt's Sennot Square building.
(from Forbes @ the \"O\", turn onto S. Bouquet St. and make a right onto Sennott Street.  Make another quick right into the building's lot)"}
{"text":"While this place is a favorite with local college students, its appeal has gone nationwide with their hotdogs being considered the 4th best in the country according to Gourmet magazine.  And they offer up several variations and allow for a whole host of toppings including cheese, mustard, ketchup, relish, sauerkraut, and chili.  I opted for one of their new dogs which has cheese and jalapeno peppers inside of it, and really enjoyed it.  Beyond the hotdogs though, they are also famous for their ridiculously sized portions of fries.  I ordered the small which can easily feed two people by itself.  And they have a six pack shop with several hundred brands of beer available for purchase.  Yeah, college friendly to be sure.  

Some notes on the experience:

- Lines are long even at off-peak times, and sometimes people order for several people at once, so be prepared.

- Hotdogs are available up front, but fries are available in the rear.  So if you want both, you will have to wait in line twice.  Annoying!

- There is ample seating on the second level with a nice view of Forbes Avenue.

The place is a historic landmark, and is definitely a good roadside stop.  If you are ever in the 'burgh, check them out!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. We went here on a Saturday after a concert and it was a terrible experience. We first walked in and were greeted rudely by a cook that looked like he hadn't showered for days. He was very rude. I ordered 3 hot dogs and a medium fry and it was over 17 dollars. They have the nerve to charge a gratuity since it was saturday night. Why should you pay a gratuity for walk up counter service and rude service at that. The hot dogs were terrible and the straw that broke the camels back.... the restroom. I have been in porta johns that smelled better. It was so smelly and dirty, I wanted to take a shower in clorox. NEVER AGAIN O"}
{"text":"came here on a trip (i am from LA) and i loved it. i didnt expect to; there are a ton of good hot dog shops in LA, but i was wrong. I had onions, cheese and ketchup on my dog and we got a medium fries (for 5 people it was a lot). one of the only places i want to return when i come back to PA."}
{"text":"After more than 25 years,  still the best hot dogs I've ever had.  A super dog with chili and onions is a must.  Medium fry covered the wife and 3 kids. Had lunch here on sunday. Will be back on monday."}
{"text":"Good drunk food but not good food. The pizza is microwaved at best. the dogs are all most all fat. the only good thing is the fry's. beer selection is OK but you don't know how long some of those beers have been there. and the on tap is a joke."}
{"text":"Its been a great place to satisfy your desire for hot crispy fries and
a hot dog done your way!!!
Prices are very reasonable.
Wish parking was easier but it is in the heart of Oakland.
You have to try this at least once."}
{"text":"I came here countless years ago and to this day this place has still had a big impression on me! Well I cannot recall how big the restaurant is or the cleanliness... I remember we got a pizza with large fries. 

The pizza was pizza, nothing over the top but greasy and was savory on the taste buds like pizza normally is... BUT THE FRIES WERE AMAZING! 

If you are like me you enjoy quality but also appreciate quantity. I have never seen a single order of fries this large anywhere! And by God it was deliciously greasy and good! 

Again it's been a long time and I don't eat that type of food much anymore but I think one day soon I will return and enjoy this gem of a restaurant once again! 

Get the fries bro... Just get the fries"}
{"text":"Came in to this place on a whim and, well, was rather disappointed.  I like the retro look and vibe of this place (seems like it's still stuck in the 70s)...however, the dog I ordered was overpriced and mostly gross. They look scrumptious sitting on the griddle thingy but when they hit your mouth...whooeee!!! What a letdown. Mine had a rubbery texture and was salty as all get out.  Can't speak for the rest of their food."}
{"text":"I love this place! Went for a hot dog, ordered a pizza & can say I think it is one of the best in the burgh. Great beer to go selection. Was happy to see this place still serving up a decent hot dog after 25+ years!"}
{"text":"This place provides a consistent service and does not try to be something that it is not. I took visitors here after our wedding and we had the fries and chili dogs. The huge portions and options to dip your fries makes this place a destination when you want food that is not healthy. Their burgers when you want one outside of typical fast food joints are exactly what you are looking for as you can load them up with toppings that stay on the burger and make it taste better. Pizza here is when you want a \"greasy\" pizza that you use a napkin to dabble away the melted droplets from the cheese."}
{"text":"All time favorite fries right here. I used to eat their fries with Laser Malt Liquor every monday night when I threw monday night football parties in my dorm room. I invited the bums to the party in exchange for buying our beer. It was awesome. The people at the O knew, but as long as a bum was willing to front, we had our Laser Malt Liquor. Hot dogs are the bomb, but the star is the fries."}
{"text":"My fries were burnt, so I called and was informed to freeze them. This way when I return they'll be able to see. My husband and I did follow the advise; however, I believe they are becoming disconnected with their patrons. I guess we will have stick with the hot dogs only. Sadly, we will limit our frequency there."}
{"text":"So, I'll be clear, this place is best experienced crunk.  That's right, crazy drunk.  It is super dirty and just generally pretty gross.  Avoid at all costs if the bathroom is broken or you will see a homeless mans wiener as he just stands at the bottom of the stairs and pees into the swelling pool of fetid urine and vomit.  Pittsburghers love this place because they give you a comically large amount of food, that you will ultimately regret eating when you actually start sweating french fries.  If you hate your body, or really like man vs. food but think he's just too elitist, then this could be your place.  It remains open because college kids are an equal mix of stupid and poor."}
{"text":"A very odd place. Military-like in the way they run things. Drinks are locked up. Mean signs everywhere. Only one person for this and one person for that. Not what it used to be. Pre-made fries!? Ordered two cheese dogs and they folded two pieces of American cheese on the hot dogs and put them in a warmer!?! What happened to using cheese sauce? Overpriced and not what it used to be."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife who went to undergrad at Pitt.  I heard great things about the place and I wouldn't say it disappointed, but I would not say it lived up to all the hype.  

I got two hot dogs: one with chili and onions, and the other with sauerkraut, onions, ketchup, and mustard.  In addition, a medium order of fries.  

I know there is a lot of hype surrounding the fries, but in truth, they are just regular fries.  

In regards to the hot dogs, they were good.  I would say it is similar to Gray's Papaya here in NY.  

So in short, if you don't want to spend a lot of money and just want to have a simple bite, I would recommend this spot."}
{"text":"A legend. Cheap and bad for you. Fries with gravy is the best. Going to the O is a PGH experience. Enjoy it for what it is a cheap dive bar with greasy food. YUM!!"}
{"text":"Man this was the best place to have so close to campus.  There is nothing better than woofin' down a ton of fries with gravy and some dogs after a night of beer drinking.  I've been here many times...and probably more times than I can literally remember...8^0 !!!

I went in with 3 friends and we ordered the friggin' gargantuan sized fries.  It was basically an ENTIRE basket fryer just dumped on a tray.  Needless to say 4 of us couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Hot dog was too thin. The guy behind the counter was very nice. The food came out quickly. Chili needed more kick. It was disappointing. I might be back but probably not."}
{"text":"Went there late on a Sunday night and there were still people in line.  The hot dog was overcooked so there wasn't a snap to it rather a dull char on the ends.  Also, be picky about your condiments.  Don't get \"everything\" on it or else it'll be too busy.  

The fries are great.  You definitely get a lot.  Also, if you just order a hot dog and fries, they'll be nice enough to tell you to get a drink and save a few cents on the combo.  The place isn't that great, but it does serve as comfort food for the Oakland area."}
{"text":"I hope the employees know CPR. I can feel my arteries clogging from the small fry, oh my goodness. The dog was tasty. It was a little different for me being a West Coast kid where I'm not use to my hot dogs crunching when I bite into them. The fries were delicious AND HUGE!!!!! I rolled out happy.
P.S. I was told the small fry was big, nothing could have prepared me for the size of the small fry. It's huge. Order with caution."}
{"text":"If you are from Pittsburgh, go for the nostalgia.  If you want even passable food, just stay away.

First, the famous fries:   There are a lot of them, yes, and they come in a giant congealed \"fry-ball\" you have to pick apart.   Imagine an Outback \"blooming onion\" that has been run over.  I don't even think the ketchup is Heinz (isn't that a crime in Pittsburgh?) because it tasted low-grade and is served in a little cup with a peel-away top like lunch box applesauce.

Second, the famous hot-dogs:  These are thin, flavorless, overcooked, crunchy hot dogs served on a steamed store bun.   I had chili and onions on mine, which clearly came from a can.  I've had better hot dogs at the ball park, and they cost about the same.

My friend had the chicken sandwich, which while OK, was exactly the same thing you can get at Wendy's down the street.

And while I don't expect much service from a hot dog and fries joint, ordering here is insanely complicated.  Each counter serves something different, and to assemble an actual meal requires some patience and dexterity.  I'm from Philly, and ordering cheesesteaks from Pat's isn't even this hard.

The Big \"O\" is another college tradition that is best left to college students."}
{"text":"Every large university area I have been to seems to have a hot dog shop near it. Some are great others are not, but one this is true is that they all offer cheap eats. In this case we have an oddity, a fairly expensive hot dog stand offering poor food.

OK I know this place is an iconic Pittsburgh institution but the food is sorely lacking. First of all if you want a dog or two and some fires you have to stand in two different lines, so either you dogs get cold or your fries get gold while you are waiting for the other. LAME.

Second complaint the dogs are cooked on a griddle where they sit and sit and sit drying out, my idea of a hot dog is not a semi-blackened piece of jerky meat, it should he juicy and succulent. It's too bad that they ruin their dogs this way, getting past the dried out part the taste of this dog would have been pretty good if prepared correctly

Third complaint the buns - what is with east coast people and their feeble wonder bread buns they serve hot dogs on? You have two main components: The dog and the bun, both of these should be of high quality if you skimp on either one you will have a sub-par hot dog.

Fourth complaint - complete and utter disorganization of ordering, waiting and paying for your dog. You would think that some genius would be able to how to figure out and streamline the process to make it more efficient. Also hire some employees with some personality the three that were there seemed to hate their jobs.

Fifth complaint - $ 7.75 for two regular dogs (this was a special too) and a drink is ridiculous, throw in fries and I'm over $10 bucks - that's highway robbery for what was served.

FOOD 1.5 stars - it's hard to screw up a hot dog but they did it
SERVICE 1.5 stars - I think if anybody smiled their face would have fallen off.
VALUE 1 star, OK I have to give at least 1 star according to yelp otherwise this would be zero.

Total: 1.33 stars

For hot dogs in PA both The Frantuary (2 stars) has won in the toppings contest while Wiener World (3 stars) has the best dogs and buns."}
{"text":"so i am trying to make my way to our table, carrying 7 cups of ice water and one beer and there is a large man with his back to me, talking and waving his arms. 

i get the feeling he has run into an old friend, who by the looks of it is slightly less excited to see large man, perhaps has even been avoiding him? who knows. 

so i, the experienced crowd navigator (honed by years of crowded parties, bars, and working in retail) say, \"excuse me--\" he doesn't notice me, flailing arms, exclaiming at his friend. \"excuse me, sir-- i just want to squeeze by you,\" normally i try a light touch on the shoulder, but as i said, my hands were full of water cups.  i start to get frustrated (was my hot dog getting cold waiting at the table?) 

i squeeze by, spilling some beer in the process.  after making it to the table and biting into those greasy perfect french fries, i see my sister (aka the tightest girl ever) in the same predicament, blocked by large man.  she, who won't let anything get between her and her lunch, says \"excuse me!\" once, and he finally turns, looks at her and turns back around, ignoring her and still blocking her way.  she is only holding a pile of napkins, so she pushes past him saying, \"you are an inconsiderate asshole! asshole!!\"  he may not have noticed (he was still talking hella loud to his \"friend\"), but another woman did and gave her a dirty look.  not missing a beat, my sister looks at her says: \"tourrets!!\" and moves quickly over to our table.  (get that, girl.)

{"text":"My friend dragged me outside for some fresh air and took me here since I've never been. I can't speak for the restrooms or questionable crowds though I can speak for the fries and hot dog. We didn't run into too many people here and we ended up eating upstairs. The hot dog was great and the fries were really, really good. The man who took our order was easy going and quick. Of course you're not getting a healthy meal when you come here, but it's all part of the experience. I enjoyed mine and I'd go back to take a fellow out-of-towner for a heart attack."}
{"text":"3.5 stars but rounding up for uniqueness and tradition.

The Original Hot Dog shop looks as OG as it claims to be, but falls short of expectations and seems to be a washed up version of its former self.

The interior is the old school style you'd expect out of a 1970s diner, but everything is just so old now, and almost repulsive in a way. I hate to say it, but sometimes it's just necessary to do some renovation and move on to newer times.

As for the food---the menu is super cluttered, which I guess is like the old times, but makes things hard to find. The hot dogs themselves aren't stellar...Not a big fan of the crispy skin, but otherwise, they are exactly as you'd expect from a hot dog. I didn't taste any difference between the all beef dog and the normal ones, which was kinda disappointing, but they are still tasty and perfect for an American food craving.

The toppings are classic---your typical relish, ketchup, mustard, onions. You can even get bacon and cheese if you want, but I thought the bacon was pretty dry. 

A pleasant surprise was the fries, which cooked in peanut oil made them super toasty and crispy. 

Overall, I still enjoyed my meal, and definitely satisfied my craving. To have a hot dog shop is already commendable in itself, especially considering how low of a food hot dogs are, and I hope they stick around for a while to keep an important tradition alive."}
{"text":"Why would anyone want to go to a place like this? Everywhere you look is pure terribleness.

The place itself is sooo 30 years ago and has more awful wood veneer than the veneer room in an '80s Chrysler minivan factory.

The menu is ridiculously confusing and most (not all) of the workers are unattractive and unfriendly and simply don't care and don't care to help you.

And the food is sooo unhealthy! After ordering a hotdog and a small fry, one of the workers was like \"Anti-diet food right there,\" he said.

Oh, and the bathrooms aren't much bigger than the large fries!! If you actually manage to find them and survive the climb down the veneer lined, near 90 degree angle stairs. 

So why the 4 stars? Because the food truly is good and they came up with a winning idea many years ago and they're simply leaving good enough alone."}
{"text":"First let me say, the fry sizes of small, medium and large don't mean the same thing here as they do in the rest of the world.

If you have a group that is smaller than 6 starving college students, don't even think about ordering a large, trust me.

While the place is called the original hot dog shop, I always pass on the dogs and order a burger.  I like them much better.  

Combine the burger and fries with a tasty malt liquor and that's all you need for a great meal."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry Original Hot Dog Shop for ever straying from your fluorescent signs. 

Yes it is a life threatening ordeal to come here late at night, yes there is a high chance that you will also get mugged, yes it smells weird, yes the food is incredibly greasy BUT the Original Hot Dog Shop is like that one weird Uncle that we all have. 

He's a little rough around the edges but when the going gets bad he'll give you a giant hug and tell you that it's going to be all right. He's probably the only relative that is up at 3am that you can go to for some solace. 

I was feeling a little down in the dumps but there it was, the infamous O beckoning me, 4 dollars for half a bag of fries? Yes. Yes please. I'm so sorry O. I rescind my previous 3 star rating. We can all be honest and say that as college students, this is the place to go when times get a little rough."}
{"text":"It only gets 3 stars because it is a 'must visit' in Pittsburgh.  Barely a 2 otherwise.

This is a greasy, untidy hole-in-the-wall in the middle of PITT'S campus.  Their fries are a neat novelty, and you won't be disappointed by taste or volume.  Most of the time, the multiple pounds of fries are served in a loaf form, in the exact shape of the fryer basket.

Other than that, not many positive things to say about it.

The dogs do have a nice 'snap,' due to natural casings, but at $5.00 and up, not really worth the price.  Chili and other fixings are free, except for cheese, which is $1.00 (!) extra.  And the chili seems to be from a can AND HAS BEANS.  No thanks.  I'll take a Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe dog anytime, for barely over a buck.

The pizza was bland and slightly cardboard-ish, although I assume that it satisfies at 2:00 AM, after a long night at the bars or frat houses.

Go once for the fries, then leave it for the stumbling underclassmen to enjoy."}

{"text":"The Original Hotdog shop, or the \"O\", is one of my favorite spots in all of Pittsburgh. Why? They're located in the middle of a college town, open late night on weekends, sell many types of beers, have a very large menu, and famous for their hotdogs and French fries. Before I came here today, I ordered two 1/4 lb beef hotdogs at Wiener World for a taste comparison, one with chili and kraut, the other with relish, ketchup and brown mustard. 
Here, I got two kosher beef dogs for $9.25. One had chili (they were out of kraut) and the other had pickle, ketchup, and brown mustard. The dogs here are slightly burned, giving it a satisfying crunch and have a distinct greasy and salty flavors that wiener world lacks. Further, the \"O\" is more generous with toppings and the chili simply tastes better here. Overall, the \"O\" is the winner!"}
{"text":"OK really, a 5 star rating for this dive?  Let me explain. I ask the question: \"Is there something that this establishment could do better?\" In this case, the answer is no. It's a hot dog joint in a college town. They have hot dogs. However you want them. And the best fries in Pittsburgh. With gravy. And draft beer for 3 bucks in a plastic cup. Sure, they could stand to clean up the place a bit every now and again. But then it wouldn't be the \"Dirty O\" would it?"}
{"text":"I had to give this place 4 stars b/c i have so many fond drunken memories of it. My overweight RA took me to this place the day i moved into my dorm and i knew from that day forward that this place would be a favorite pitt stop on my drunken walk home. The french fries are greasy and amazing and you get to choose a dipping sauce-my favorite is cheese but you can get gravy or ranch too. I bet plenty of freshman can blame the O for their infamous 15lb weight gain. another perk is being able to stop by and get white trash 40oz mickeys to share with my roomates on hot summer nights. I'll always love this place. go PITT"}
{"text":"Ah, the legendary mountain of fries. One serving is enough to stimulate the gag reflex of at least 2 ppl. Too bad the fries are gross. Also, try their pizza if you ever found yourself curious as to what rubber tastes like.

Most of the stuff is mediocre. If you need to eat late at night, they do provide an option."}

The Original has been around forever--my father-in-law would eat there in the '60s when he was a student at Pitt.  The hot dogs are fine, the burgers are fine, the pizza is fine. There is nothing overly mind-blowing about the place. 

Oh, and the sauerkraut was COLD. A definite turn off in my book.

The fries are good, but I didn't find anything all that special about them. The employees do their jobs, but don't expect an exciting interaction with them. 

Quite honestly, the best thing about the Original is the upstairs seating area. It's quiet and doesn't smell like grease. AND it has great views of the public milling around the area. 

As a Detroiter who has consumed coney dogs her entire life, I can say that The Original has nothing on the hot dog shops of Detroit.  Skip the Original. It's not even worth saying, \"I've eaten there!\""}
{"text":"So greasy, yet so satisfying. Can we say... hot dog with cheese and bacon? Dear lord. I had to detox for a week after this Pittsburgh trip (which included Primanti Bros, Haufbrauhaus, PNC Park Phillies vs Pirates, and other bars I can't remember). Is there no healthy food in this city?"}
{"text":"Well the dogs are ok. Good snap. But the fries are the star. A small is like 3 potatoes worth and the cheese and gravy (that cost extra, but that you should still get) really make it shine. The staff is pretty brusque but not offensively so. College kids will do that to ya"}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and so glad we came here. The hot dogs are top notch, the chicken \"o\" club is awesome and the fries are some of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend coming to this spot. The owner and staff are super friendly, if I come back to Pittsburgh I'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"My daughter-in-law had never been to the iconic \"Dirty O\" and my son a Pitt alum was happy to take her there. 

The grit and the grime is what makes this a popular spot not only with the college students but also to all who visit. 

We ordered several items but the best of all was the large fry which was plenty for our party of four adults and a 2 year old. The fries were slightly greasy but hot and crispy, the side of ketchup and cheese sauce to the fries to the next level.

My daughter-in-law is a health conscious eater but was happy that she indulged in unhealthy \"Dirty O\" cuisine and became part of the hype."}
{"text":"Love the snap when you take the first bite, Great dogs and the fries are great too. Little oily but that's good!
They could chop the onions smaller than \"rough chop\"."}
{"text":"They claim they cook something like 8 gazillion lbs of fries each week.  I believe it. Customers say best fries in the world and worst public bathrooms of all time.  It's part of the charm until you need to use one. Lol, they also have over 400 beers to choose from
But given the previous point, probably a better six pack to go kind of place."}
{"text":"The \"O\" is a longstanding member of the Oakland community. It's sad that it has taken me this long to try it. It is a Hot Dog Shop-but a very good one. The hotdogs are hot and have grill marks. You have a lot of choices when it comes to topping your hot dog. They have bacon, jalapeños, onions, relish, cheese, chili, and possibly a few other toppings. I like to keep it very simple and just have brown mustard.  The hot dogs have a\"snap\" to them when you take a bite. They are really good hotdogs. They are longer than a regular hotdog but not quite a footling. 
They make each serving of French fries when they are ordered so you get them hot and fresh. They ask if you want them salted (Yes!). Their serving size is big. One serving is 2 if not 3 times bigger than a McDonald's large fry. These fries are fresh cut potatoes. They are fried to the right temperature and have soft and crunchy parts. 
No matter what you order you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Hidey ho!  Hot dogs and wet fries.  By wet, I mean with gravy.  If you're in Pittsburgh, you already knew that."}
{"text":"A great Pittsburgh tradition.  The fries are outrageous!!

Great place to go when you are extremely hungry ..."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since 1993.  I live in So Cal where the lifestyle is healthier than Pittsburgh.  For 4 years I clogged my arteries and put myself on Lipitor because of this joint.  Where else can you go and spend $4 on a 1 to 2 ft high pile of french fries?  They are fresh cut and don't come frozen out of a paper bag.  They taste DAMN GOOD and better yet they serve Kraft Cheese Whiz!  Not the imitation, the one and only KRAFT!  If I had a penny for every time I was there drunk or sober, I'd give Trump a run for his money.  You go to the \"O\" with friends.  Never by yourself.  Now granted it's been 15 years and with the price of inflation, I can remember spending $1.50 on a great hot dog.  This hot dog had some snap to it.  Also, a large pizza cost $5.  You can go here for less than $5 a person and feed the cast of Entourage, including all of Vincent Chase's women.  I miss this place like there is no tomorrow.  My arteries will always be aching for The \"O\"."}
{"text":"The O is a cornerstone of Oakland. Almost every Pitt student remembers at least one 3 am visit to the O to share the largest small fry order of the terrestrial planets. The O has plenty of other junk food options such as chicken fingers, hot dogs, burgers, pizza, etc. but the small fry with your choice of condiment or cheese is the way to go if you want a proper experience here."}
{"text":"Okay, so the bathroom here is probably the grossest I've seen or smelled.  That said, the rest of my experience here was quite enjoyable.  The hot dogs were great, they had a lovely crust.  I hate it when hot dogs are just boiled and rubbery.  I enjoy the flavor and texture of a crust on my dogs.  The fries were delicious as well, and a huge portion!  We ordered the medium and the 4 of us polished it off, but after checking out the large that our neighbors ordered, I knew we made the right choice!  All in all, this was a cool place to visit for an out-of-towner.  I think it's a local favorite as well, since they were locals who brought me here.  I would definitely hit this place up again if I was in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is just what you'd expect from a late night dive - greasy, no frills, and just enough grime to make you question your decision to eat there. The all beef hot dog was surprisingly good, but that's probably why it's more expensive than their regular dog. I had a chicken part sandwich that could've been made in a microwave for all I know. The fries were a highlight, though."}
{"text":"Went there after 11pm because no time for dinner in the evening. Original cheese dog, super dog and 15 pieces spicy chicken wings. The Super dog is tasty with bacon. Their wiener (or sausage) is smoked and very tasty. The Chicken Wings are AMAZINGLY TASTY, TENDER AND CRISPY! I was truely shocked by their tasty chicken wings and I promised they are absolutely the top5 chicken wings I have ever tried! You can have hot sauce (tastes like buffalo) on the side but I did not use it. If you really need sauce you can have a try but the sauce is not highly recommended (quite common.)"}
{"text":"I love myself a hotdog every now and then. Coming from Chicago I heard of this place when I moved here and there great hotdogs.  I am just not a fan, the hotdog was nothing great and it was even on the lukewarm side. I'll have to find another place to fill my hotdog cravings."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here with family and friends at so many points at life that I feel like going to the O was part of my experience of growing up in Pittsburgh. If it was my birthday and we were eating out, where did I want to go? The O. Where was the place I had to eat at one last time before I moved to Chicago? The O. And the great thing is that there are tons of other people who have the same feelings about this place.

What's so great about it? Well, at the very least, some of the best frickin fries I've ever had in my life, and I know my potatoes. Crispy and salty and large enough to feed a small army (or my teenage brother and 2 friends). The cheese sauce is packaged, and I don't know what kind of magical ingredient they sneak in there, because it's way more delicious than it should be. I've raved up and down about the fries to all my friends, and my favorite thing is to see their look of disbelief when I tell them about the portion size turn to wide-eyed amazement when the heaping mass of spuds is placed before them. I can't say I'm too adventurous with the menu- I've never had the philly steaks or pizza because to me the only natural accompaniment to the fries are the Super Dogs (their incredible bounce-back-when-you-bite-into-them hot dogs with cheese and bacon). It's really handy that UPMC Presbyterian is close by.

 The other thing I love is that the O is unpretentious as hell and proud of it. Is it sketchy past 9 pm? Yeah, probably. Are the bathrooms gross? I've never had the courage to discover for myself, and a friend who did shuddered and wouldn't speak of the experience. But to me, that speaks for its authenticity, that it knows it's a neighborhood joint that people go to, in part, to experience some kind of Oakland rite of passage or to relive it. 

Just don't schedule a doctor's appointment for the next day."}
{"text":"Greatest hot dogs I've had in a long time! The fries are also delicious! The atmosphere is a little meh but college friendly, which works. It feels just a little dirty inside, no matter what time of day I've been there. 

Another plus is that there's a great selection of beers always available, bottle not tap. The tap ones are pretty standard. 

Late night is a pretty great time too, thank god something in this town is open later than 10pm!"}
{"text":"One side of the restaurant you get in a line for your beef hotdogs. The other side is a line for fries. Simple but done to perfection. I don't care that there is not a lot of choices, if you have one thing that you can do to perfection that does it for me. So as far as eating hot dogs go this is a five star."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced, with bad food. I can't imagine how they stay in business when there are so many better and cheaper places all around them."}
{"text":"On days when I'm feeling particularly masochistic and want to put a stroke on layaway, I will head down to the \"O\" and get me some fries and a hot dog.  What makes this place so good is that it's so bad - like a terrible 80's movie that you just feel drawn into.  Speaking of 80's....that's probably the last time this place has had a good scrub down.  

Anyway, there are lots and lots of way better places in Oakland to eat, but sometimes you just *have* to do the Original Hot Dog Shop.  Just make sure you wash your hands really, really well after you've touched any surfaces there..."}
{"text":"Ok. This place I know is a Pittsburgh staple. It has been around since longer than I have been alive. It is somewhere you go, well I go, when I am really craving a salty dog or fries. Usually this happens after a night class and before I go home to sleep of the working full time going to school part time blues. The food is plentiful but I will say that the prices are a little steep for what it is. 

I went here last for national hotdog day. I was expecting some fanfare or something but the employee told me that every day is national hotdog day for him. Ok, I mean, I get it...but no discounts? No nothing? So I got two hotdogs with a slew of toppings and the price came out to be almost $9. Um... for two hotdogs. I mean they were great, really hit the spot but that price....eh... 

We also got a basket of fries for four people. Massive! But again ketchup and cheese were extra and the price tag of the massive fries were $10. Again...they were great, but that price..eh...

I also spent the rest of the night downing water because my sodium content was way off the charts. 

I like the O, it is some place that I think everyone needs to try once. I am not saying it is my go to, but it is fine for a once in a long while whim. The atmosphere is different and quieter than most of the other places you can head to in Oakland. But the price for what you get, this is not a place that I will come back to often. 

It is good, salty, and fast but the order will hit your wallet for sure. 

Everyone should try it out and go here once. Get the big basket of fries late night and just enjoy the atmosphere. It is a good place to pull up a table and chat after a long day of work and school."}
{"text":"Well first off, it took us about five minutes of watching people to figure out how to order. You see, there are three counters. One for hot dogs, one for beers, and the last covered everything else (sandwiches, fries, soft drinks, etc...). When I finally did get up to order, the guy refused to take my credit card.

The place also doesn't look that clean. In fact, it looked downright filthy. The tables were dirty, and I could get the occasional whiff of the bathrooms from where we were sitting.

The food, however, was amazing. I got a cheeseburger and a \"small\" order of fries. The small fries I ordered were about twice as big as anyone else's large, and they were amazing. The burger looked like a cheap and generic pre-pressed patty like you'd buy in the supermarket. It was also amazing however."}
{"text":"Note: The O now accepts credit cards. 

O is for Origins.

Lo, there is a place in Pittsburgh that serves french fries of mythical quality and in prodigious quantities, a place that is foreboding to some and is surrounded by legends both mirthful and menacing. Its formal, earthly name is The Original Hot Dog Shop. Its name to those in the circle and kindred of tongue is simply The O, and for the first time in 2 decades, I ate heartily there on a niveous Saturday without one bit of remorse. 

O is for Old.

52 years ago, The O opened in student-centered Oakland (coincidence?), and since then, from its brown tile floors (which were clean this time) and vivid interior signage to its movie theater marquee, it has largely remained unchanged. I began coming here weekly when I was a student at now defunct Schenley High School in the top 80's and bottom 90's. A ritual for my mopheaded gang of pals and myself, we knew how to navigate The O when we visited, to not dally, to SHARE those french fries no matter how small the order called for, to avoid the restroom. I stopped coming  during my first semester at the University of Pittsburgh when I discovered that it was far away from campus and too pricey for my college-era budget.

O is for Options.

One aspect I've always found intriguing about The O is that it is somewhat reminiscent of a food court, and thus their selection of items is relatively vast. I recall them even having BBQ chicken and funnel cakes on their menu at one time. My favorite adversaries from the lost days of my youth were the mammoth subs of the steak and meatball variety as well as their (new at the time) surprisingly superb and cheap pizzas. I also never minded that there were stations for ordering different things. De facto, I think it's one of those quirks that adds to The O's mystique and uniqueness. Ranters and whiners: deal with it. 

O is for Oily.

Yes, those fantastical french fries remain as rich, chewy, debased,and indulgent as they were when last I gorged on them moons and moons ago. A \"small' order of these wrathful, scalding goldenrods is thrice that of the average fast food chain, therefore threatening to overwhelm the novice visitor (intruder?). As a boy, I never thought of handling the jaundiced hoard myself. Today, I defeated them all, standing alone, leaving nothing but brown crumbs and traces of their mysteriously saccharine ketchup (all I was told is that it ain't Heinz) that comes in generously rationed cups. The skin of each tater staff is akin to paper melding with glass and when broken into reveals mashed spud manna. Doubly christened (cursed?) in bubbling peanut oil, I am once again convinced that there exists no other specimen of this obligatory side dish that matches the supremacy of The O's hellishly humongous heaps of froylated potato.

O is for Outgoing.

One caveat I had regarding The O in another life was that the employees were usually distressed, overworked, and as a result, often rude and impatient. Saturday's emprise was an entirely different and much more benign episode. A short, bespectacled, middle-aged woman in a sweatshirt  that could have been anyone's mother greeted me ardently when I told her how long it had been since my last encounter with The O. My order was taken and received without delay or attitude. I even got to pick a cook's brain and had a brief conversation with some visiting Southerners. No one looked haggard or intimidating in the least. The food, however...

O is for Ominous.

Not having been impressed with their hot dogs in the past, I went for their baneful dark horse of a sandwich, The Hot Sausage Sub, and unlike another reviewer, for me,eating it was a daunting, thrilling revelry. The bread was toasted yet plush, the sauce that enveloped it was rubicund, resembling a river of blood in which a dragon swam, that dragon being the sausage itself,one that is loaded with spice and succulent ground pig. Barely prevailing o'er The O's secret serpentine sentinel, I let out a loud belch with fists clenched, chest out, and chin upward, frightening co-eds and their parental units with my guttural, gaseous victory cry. 

O is for Omega. 

In closing, I have soberly relished almost everything I've ever ordered from The O's biblical bill of fare. My next visit will be soon. I shall neglect this institution no longer for The O has a menagerie of magnificent monsters that await defeat, including their fearsome franks. Beware my steel jaws, my unblunted, adamantine teeth, my stomach of smelted iron!

P.S. O is for...Oblivion?

Though not as squalid as I recalled it to be, a door is missing from the stall in the subterranean men's room. My advice is to run to the Subway down the street when nature calls and buy a 52 cent cookie while you're there. 

P.P.S. With chains increasing their presence on Forbes Avenue, I hope The O outlasts them all, except for Subway -- I need their john."}
{"text":"the hot dogs here are definitely different. good. but different. the hot dog is actually crispy on the outside. the hot dog bun isn't really anything special. next time, i'm getting cheese."}
{"text":"Fries and cheese whiz were okay, paid for extra cheese on my philly with extra meat, there was barely any cheese on it at all, thereby leaving a stench and taste of body odor. All in all charging $20 for a meal that wasn't even prepared properly is not a good look. I may swing back by for the hot dogs, but as for searching for a good philly steak in the Burgh, I'll keep searching."}
{"text":"You know I live in Boston now.  But when ever I come home to Pittsburgh, to visit, I go to the Original Hot dog Stand.  They're open late, and haven't changed in many many years.  The hot dogs snap when you bite in to them they're slightly grilled on the sides and they're long, and filled with real beef NOT beef lips, or Cow Navel, these are hot dogs.  Order a small fry; they place a tiny container on a plate , then empty the entire fry basket of fries on to it.  If you like IRON CITY BEER I guess you can still get that.  Do not visit Pittsburgh without getting a hot dog at The Original Hot Dog Stand.
(You can also buy their weenies raw and cook them at home)"}
{"text":"Like many have said before me, I think the historical factor is what keeps this place open (well and the college kids) but I digress.

Just your typical hot dog shop. Honestly nothing special about it. Fries aren't very good either. Pretty much like fries you could get anywhere else. $4 for an ok hot dog seems absolutely crazy to me. The service is terrible as well. It's like none of them want to be there."}
{"text":"Whenever the situation warrants, I'll usually ask a business acquaintance from the Pittsburgh area whether they have been to \"The O\" lately.  Usually I get a smile and a conversation ice-breaker.  It's been years since I've been here, but by all indications, little changes.  In Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood, the heart of the college district, \"The O\" represents all of the angst and energy, the culinary hedonism and \"WTF\" attitude of my undergraduate years (in Cleveland).  Hot dogs are their namesake, and they're alright; the burgers and steak sandwiches are okay.  What everybody remembers about \"The O\" must be seen to be believed.  An order of fries or onion rings is huge beyond anticipation.  I would suspect that a few orders of fries from \"The O\" would have carried Napoleon's troops across Russia in the middle of winter.  Quantity aside, they're good.  You won't find the crisp, double-fried french fries or duck fat and truffle froufrou here; this is a roll-up-the-sleeves blue collar place.  I doubt that it is the cleanest place I've ever eaten in, but this isn't a place for whining and complaining, calorie-counting or sustaining a healthy diet.  It's cash-only, and there's no parking for blocks around, but that would be whining and complaining.  Order, sit down and gorge; eating can be this simple!"}
{"text":"We came here because we heard it was a Pittsburgh staple not only does the atmosphere suck but the hot dogs were hard and we got about 4 onions rings. Literally 4 onion rings and two hot dogs for $15 save your money and go somewhere else. It's not even worth it late night."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh institution...

There is no reason to review the food or the ambiance - it's not about that. If you don't know The O, then you're simply missing out. And if you're too much of a foodie to appreciate it, then too bad for you."}
{"text":"I cried the day they removed the O from the University Center at CMU. I remember being physically unable to finish my meal the first time I ate here as a freshman, but by the end of freshman year (and 10+ pounds later), I was a pro! They have a lot of great toppings for your burger and you can choose your cheese too - my personal favorite was a burger with ketchup, mustard, cheddar cheese, lettuce, fried onions, and EGG TOP. The fries are wonderfully greasy and delicious and go great with gravy. Their chicken fingers and chicken parm sandwich are also excellent, and they have some of the best honey mustard I've ever had."}
{"text":"Honestly it's just for good drunk food. I'd never eat here if I didn't just come back from the bars, and even then I've dealt with some sketchy people in the past (hence why there's always a police officer in there). Pizza is good, gives copious fries, decent cheese dip for the fries but hot dogs... Terrible!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing!  This place came highly recommended and I was left well short of my expectations.  I went there on a Saturday afternoon and there were a few other people in the restaurant although I imagine they get a decent carry out business since it's kind of small and only has a few tables.  I ordered the original hot dog, fries and a soda and after a couple of minutes, the food was ready.  The hot dog was wrinkly and overcooked and the some of the fries were burnt and way too crisp.  They do give you a decent amount of fries but I tend not to like places that burn their fries.  They also don't offer free refills although the manager did let a pregnant worman have a refill on the house which was a nice gesture (she was getting her refill while we were in line).  I just don't understand the theory of making people pay for refills; fountain drinks are so cheap and refills make everyone happy.  I was actually shocked that a place like this doesn't offer free refills.  The woman behind the counter was friendly enough although I really don't care about the service in a hot dog stand.  I was told that this place was the second best hot dog restaurant behind Nathan's.  I find that hard to believe and if it's true, the distance between one and two is miles and miles.  I left feeling gipped and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This is a must stop for me when I'm in town and need some grease in my diet. O's supported my food addiction my freshman year at Pitt.  Back in the day we affectionately called it the Dirty \"O.\" Very large menu but the hot dogs and fresh cut French fries are the way to go. If you are extremely hungry, hungover or high this is your place. It's also a bar, and gets very busy on Friday and Saturday nights.

* love this place but stay away from the restrooms....you have been warned."}
{"text":"The Best Hotdog on the planet! This place is an Icon to the Burgh!"}
{"text":"This is not a place to seek out for an amazing dinner but when you are a low cash college student, in need of late night after drinking food, then this is your place. 
What I  do remember is a greasy ginormous bag of fries, greasy cheap pizza and wings. 
For those to lazy to dispose of their wing bones in the trash, go ahead and throw them on the floor. (I haven't been here in years so maybe they don't allow this anymore)
The O provides many fond drunken memories. It is kind of funny that given its name, I never once ate a hot dog here!"}
{"text":"Only been here a couple times. But I can truthfully say that I was thoroughly satisfied on both occasions. There's a lot more here than just hot dogs, and I like the old school feel. It's basically your all-in-one pizza, subs, burger, hot dog, beer place. And pretty much everything you can buy there is sure to be good."}
{"text":"My mom and dad raved about the place.  So while visiting my dads old neighborhood we went for lunch... I didn't like it. The food was heavy and so salty. No fountain drinks either. Not to mention there was only air in certain parts of the restaurant. My dad enjoyed it though. I won't be back when I visit again."}
{"text":"If you are colored person be ready to be treated funny. But fries are always good. The person spoke to Me as if I didn't know how to speak English so be ready to be treated awkward but as I said fries are always good"}
{"text":"Had a craving for some chilli cheese dogs!! My sister looked up a couple hot dog places around town & we ended up here. Service was good, they were ready to take our order when we walked in the door. I watched them as they made our food, my mouth couldn't stop watering! We both ordered 2 chilli cheese dogs with onions... Yumm!! This is my first time having their hot dogs, so I didn't know what to expect. Before biting into my first hot dog I had to smell the aroma from the chilli, cheese, & onions. Biting into my chilli cheese dog I got a lot of great flavors. But at the same time I tasted the iron grill that they cooked the hot dog on. I was not a fan of that flavor at all, so that was a turn off! I may try them again since it was my first hot dog experience there."}
{"text":"Delicious fries. Reminds me of college when I used to get a greasy bag of fries to go with a side of ranch dressing. I haven't been back since college even though I still live in Pittsburgh, but I still think about those fries!"}
{"text":"If I'm in the mood for a good hot dog and fries, this is probably going to be my go to spot. I'm still new to Pittsburgh, and this place was recommended to me by a friend. The whole process of where to order what was kind of confusing...we had to order and pay for our hot dogs at one counter, and fries and a drink at another. The place also could have stood a good sweeping and mopping for only being 11am. Anyway, the small fries we got were humungous, the hot dog was big, and everything was tasty!"}
{"text":"First, the hot dogs here are quite good. The fries are greasy, but taste okay. The cleanliness leaves something to be desired. It's understandable for a hot dog place to be casual, but there seems to be some compromises going on in terms of having clean aprons, cook tops, etc. the sloppiness is somewhat unappetizing. But again, if this doesn't bother you, this place will satisfy your grease craving."}
{"text":"Late August found me and my two traveling companions on the ragged tail-end of a road trip that had taken us through seven states, posting an eye-popping number of miles on our unlimited mileage rental car. 

We were somewhere west of Pittsburgh, traveling 70 mph, well past dinner time. I suggested dropping into the University of Pittsburgh neighborhood where we would surely find lots of Thai and Indian restaurants, respite from the hamburgers, hot dogs, fries and soft drinks we'd been overdosing on.

I like the city of Pittsburgh a lot. I like the hills and all of the bridges that remind me of San Francisco. I like the Pitt campus neighborhood. Yes, I like Pittsburgh even in spite of the Original Hot Dog Shop.

This restaurant reminds me a lot of a college dorm room; so unsanitary, so unkempt that only college students could survive and thrive there. You go to the bathroom to wash up and you emerge dirtier than before.

But people around this college neighborhood like it, obviously. It's busy. 

I don't know how we ended up here. Inexplicably, my hamburger hating friends voted for it (and those great Thai and Indian restaurants we looked for never showed up, no matter how much searching we did).

The hamburger, though made of frozen patties, was actually not terrible, saved by a good bun and toppings.  I didn't get any, but the huge piles of hot, greasy fries looked like a standout item here. Unfortunately, the guy working the hamburger counter was a pretty rude sort. 

Goodsir, have you ever considered moving to New York? You'd enjoy it."}
{"text":"OK, this has got to be the most gross place in all of Pittsburgh.   But, Because of it's notoriety, I thought I would make a stop at the \"O\" and at least give it a try.  I had a dog (with the works) and ordered fries, just because it was suggested to me that they give you the most unbelieveable size of fries you have ever seen.  True enough - they were large, and actually quite good.  The dog, well.....let's just say it was a hot dog, nothing special.  The lady behind the counter cooking the dogs is a real hoot - if nothing else, stop in just to check her out.  Everything in this place is sticky and greasy, but you know even before you go in what to expect just from the exterior \"ambience.\""}
{"text":"We're all adults, let's be honest here- this is not where one goes when sober. But at the end of a long night out with friends, this hits the spot! 

Tip #1: Don't use the bathroom, seriously, it will scar you for life. Worst. Bathroom. Ever. I have used it twice in life, once at age 12 then again at age 27. Both times I could have used therapy afterward. 

Tip #2: Order a small fry if you're by yourself or with 1 other person- there will be much more than you expect, it's like a large McD fry x 6. Get cheese! The cheese is glorious while hot, but doesn't reheat well and gets minus one star because it used to be better 5 years ago.

Tip #3: Go tipsy! Otherwise you might look at the hygienic issues surrounding you and get turned off. But for all of its skankiness, I've NEVER known anyone to get sick here. In fact, it's saved me some nights from waking up hung over.

Tip #4: Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"They have awesome hot dogs. When you order the fries, just remember: they are very generous. If it's just you and one other person, you do not need a medium order. Stick with the small."}
{"text":"The fries. 'Nuff said. (Actually I would have to add that the small is good enough for three people). Now, 'nuff said."}
{"text":"Fries are cooked to perfection....very crispy.  Portions are out of this world.  Don't waste your time on a small or medium, you'll regret not having more. 

Hot Dogs & Burgers were very good.

Secure Parking is available around the corner at S Bouquet St & Sennott St for a few bucks."}
{"text":"What a college fast food place is supposed to look and feel like.

I live around Palo Alto (Stanford ) these days and it's just too clean and sanitary for a college town.,

I miss the look and feel of liquored up frat boys staggering down to this place, to fill up on mass quantities of tube steaks,wings and fried taters.

Nothing like a genuine college ghetto to bring back memories of my youthful indiscretions . 

Palo Alto reminds me of the Stepford Wives and Singapore rolled into one big sterile petri dish."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place, I was really excited to try it out, as I work nearby. Perhaps I didn't go at the prime time (it was about 3 pm), but the hot dog was dry, greasy, and simply lacked taste. The fries (which so many people have written about) were not very crispy, and I didn't think that they really stood out either. Perhaps I went at a time when there was less turnover of food, but when you have the reputation that they do, and when I am paying $4 for a hot dog - I expect it to be at least average. I have eaten much better dogs at the Get Go...honestly."}
{"text":"Our friends recommended this place when we were visiting Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, we took their recommendation and went there. 
The place is filthy, disorganized, and the food is just disgusting. Plus, not even cheap!
Do not go there if you like clean environment and tasty food..."}
{"text":"A hot dog is a hot dog. Personally, not sure what the big deal with this place is other than the fact that it's open late and sells beer. 7-11's do the same thing. The hot dogs here are so so. The only redeeming thing about this place is that everything here is cheap. This is great hangout place for the college crowd. It sounds weird, but the pizza is only good for about an hour or so. For those of you that like day old pizza, this isn't the pizza to be eating day old. The fries here are actually pretty good but VERY greasy...even more so than anywhere else. They're made quick and you get your choice of dipping sauces and they really hit the spot. Best not to go late a night to this place as the police slowly start outnumbering patrons at this place."}
{"text":"Food is a bit greasy but relatively cheap; okay selection of alcohol; good college fare. Gets a bit rowdy after 10pm though, so proceed with caution."}
{"text":"The guy who used to ring me up at the O told me he had been shot 9 times while working there, and he kept coming back. That's how awesome the O is."}
