{"text":"I got a burger with chili sauce on it and some fish tacos. I was looking forward to it all week and it did not disappoint. The burger was flavorful and the tacos were excellent!

I love the new food truck revolution going on and umami mobile along with a couple other excellent area trucks set a great standard that a lot of restaurants could take note of."}
{"text":"So, went there today on public square because due to my sad disappointment, the Fired Up Taco boys truck broke down. Needless to say, after I got over my disappointment of missing my first choice, I've become a fan.

The Korean burrito was excellent. The spice was great and the portion size was decent for the price. The best part was, they took credit! For a food truck fan who doesn't like to carry cash, this was excellent. Overall, I'm pleased with my lunch and will try again."}
{"text":"I've stopped by the Umami Moto truck a few times now, and always had a great experience. Everyone there is always friendly and helpful, and everything I've had to eat has been sensational.

I just had the pad thai for lunch today, in the medium sauce and ponied up the extra two bucks for the shrimp, chicken and tofu added in. Great portion size, I struggled to finish it all and awesome flavors with just the right amount of kick.

I tried a coworkers chicken curry and while I've never been big on curry, I really enjoyed it. The curry wasn't overwhelming as is usually the case IMO.

Finally my favorite is the bahn mi. While I agree with another reviewer that the french bread roll may not be the best choice for the bread, there's no denying the flavors going on here. Huge portion of tender marinated pork and all the fresh veggies with the special mayo sauce. Go with this one and try the other options next time around.

Umami's got my vote as best food truck in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Korean Burrito was horrid. One smell of whatever 'sauce' is in it turned me off.  My meat was mushy...  everything inside (besides the sauce) was bland (except the cilantro). The most disturbing thing to me, was that my daikon was mushy instead of crunchy--- seriously, what? how? 

And I just looked at the menu. That was supposed to be kimchi fried rice? Oh ok. ... I certainly didn't taste kimchi in there. 

Maybe this was a bad night for them, but... unfortunately there was nothing about it that would make want to try a second time. Kind of sad, since I wanted to like it. 

(My fiance said the bahn mi was ok, but I didn't like it either-- but I am not a fan of pulled pork so my opinion won't for that. I am curious to why there isn't any pate)."}
{"text":"Their Korean BBQ burrito has made the list of one of my all-time favorite culinary  concoctions.  It is available with a generous amount of seitanic perfection, making it a savory faux meat treat.  The kimchi is not vegan but adds so much character to the fusion that those with more elastic ethics ought to opt for it.  Also, when you ask for the burrito spicy, brace yourself for a blissful sweating brow.  Get the sweet potato tater tots as your side, and you'll have to eat it somewhere noisy to hide your moans of pleasure."}
{"text":"The first time I went I would have given four stars. I got the Bahn Mi. It was good but nothing like the second visit where I got the Korean Burrito. Oh wow that spice on the bulgogi beef and the little crunch from the slaw and a little queso. It was amazing."}
{"text":"I finally caught up with Umami Moto yesterday at the Hessler Street Fair. I was really happy to see them.

Let me just say that these folks could not have been any sweeter and friendlier. The girl that took my order was one of the cheeriest people I've ever met -- and sometimes that's annoying but she was adorable. More humans should be like her. 

The service was obviously friendly and super quick. Everything they offer is VERY reasonably priced, too. 

I was really hoping they'd have a  Bahn Mi sandwich on the menu. Sadly, they did not.

I ordered the Vietnamese Chicken Curry and the Vietnamese Meatballs (VietBalls) to share with my little boy. Both dishes were great and very flavorful. I was famished and I'm not so sure that I really allowed myself to taste either dish properly. I scarfed that shit down right quick. My kid was being typical and picky -- oh well, more for mommy! 

Vegetarians and Vegans aren't left out in the cold either. They had at least 2-3 options for them as well. 

Can't wait to find them again!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I decided to try the food truck extravaganza on Walnut. So many trucks with so much to choose from. I saw Pad Thai and thought...perfect. Although the line was long I decided to take a chance. Everyone was super friendly and working hard but as an fyi-pad thai when you have an hour lunch may not be the right choice with such a long line. 

After getting my fresh order piping hot I couldn't wait any longer and started eating with my chop sticks on the way back to work. Yum! I ordered mine medium/hot and it was perfect. After a spritz with the lime I was set. Portion size was large-I had the 2nd half for lunch today, and they were not stingy with the peanuts. ( I should say they are my weakness.) 

Only negative was the slow line and I got chicken in my pad thai...but hey. It was a busy day so regardless I'll be finding them around town again!!! Good work!"}
{"text":"YUMMMM! My first time trying Umami Moto, during the weekly Walnut Wednesday Food Truck event.  I wisely chose the Korean Burritto, based on the menue description.  Bulgogi beef, kimchi fried rice, daikon slaw etc. and an option to choose spice level, I chose medium, which was just right, flavorful without numbing my tastebuds.  The burritto was SO good.  The beef was well seasoned and very tender.  Just the right amount of rice and the slaw had the perfect amount of cilantro.  Each component of sandwich could stand on it's own.  The serving was more than generous for $9.  I would ABSOLUTELY return to Umami Moto.....probably next week!"}
{"text":"The food trucks are a rollin' in Cleveland.

Umami Moto is the second gourmet \"meals on wheels\" cruzin around Cleveland. I can see they mean business. The truck is massive, made especially for mobile food sales.

I ordered the Bahn Mi and hot tea. As I walked away, I immediately dropped the tea all over myself :( The cups are a bit slick and the water was HOT. They were kind enough to give me another on the house. Note to self: Be sure to grab a cup liner!! I didn't see them right in front of my face on the truck ;)

At first glance, the Bahn Mi was slightly disappointing in the looks department. It was a HUGE piece of crusty french with not a lot of filling. There were meatballs, a bit of pate and just a few jalapenos and tiny slivers of pickled diakon and carrot. But I took a bite and WOW, was it flavorful! The jalapenos give a nice kick and the meatballs are really tasty. Apparently, there was supposed to be cilantro (as shown on the menu on the Facebook page). That would have definitely made the sammie more appealing to look at. Maybe they were out or forgot? But even without the cilantro, it was great. My only complaint is the way they slice the bread. Even though cutting on a slant is prettier, it makes for a few mouthfuls of just bread for the first inch or two. I ended up ripping it off to get to the good stuff. The bread was great though, very fresh and crusty...so crusty, it made for a bit of a sloppy eat. But that, I can deal with ;)

This truck will be out and about all winter supposedly. I don't know how they will make it in the cold, but I wish them luck!"}
{"text":"Umami Moto 3/5 Cleveland,OH
First food truck I got to try in Cleveland. Outside the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. Tacos are good, could use lime and an extra tortilla. Fish is delicious. Skip the Boba Tea, the flavor is nice but there is barely any ice in it, and the boba pearls are not edible."}
{"text":"I just had Ninja Kitty (my nickname for Umami Moto) for the first time today, and it was excellent!  I got the Korean beef burrito and the sweet potato tater tots.  The burrito had several flavors which complimented each other well.  I even added the hot sauce, which I recommend if you like spicy dishes.  Regarding the sweet potato tots, I could eat those all day.  I am a big fan of sweet potatoes, so the tots themselves tasted great to me, but the sauce that they pair it with made them perfect.  I can't wait to have them again.  I LOVE you Ninja Kitty!"}
{"text":"On Saturday some enjoyable weather replaced the recent Seattle type that sat over Cleveland.  As usual, I took Metropolitan Park to get to Sunset Cemetery. I buy fresh flowers on the way from the farmers market at Frostville. Calling it a farmers market is being generous as fruit and vegetables are scarce amongst the bread, bakery, pickles and pizza. But not many markets are so dramatically situated. Umami Moto was parked along the path. 

I remembered reading all the excellent yelp reviews and since there was no line I placed an order for the $8.00 steak sandwich. I stood in the sun happily waiting for my order. When it was placed on the counter I became sad. Not sad by the small size. Not sad over the convenient store type hamburger bun. I was sad that here was an Asian inspired  truck doing an amateurish job and charging double of Saigon Grill for a sandwich.  Sad because the far superior Cambodian sandwich shop in the Colonial Arcade closed never receiving the fanfare of the minor league Umami Moto with its low expenses and high prices."}
{"text":"In the last couple years, I have tried most of the items on Umami Moto Food Truck's rotation and I have enjoyed all of it.  Thus the upgrade to 5 stars.  My recent \"Curry-Licious with Duck\" was savory, flavorful, and just really really good down to the last bite.  It comes with Baby Bok Choy and mushrooms.  My other favs are the Sweet Potato Tater Tots with Sweet Curry Aioli sauce, and the variations on Vietnamese Bahn Mi Sandwiches.  The Korean BBQ Burrito and Fish Tacos are also very good.  

Highly recommended.  Follow them on Facebook to find out where to they will be, track them down like a hunter going after prey, Pounce in line, and Eat.  Thanks to U.M. for all the wonderful lunches!  :)"}
{"text":"Whoever thought up Food Trucks was a genius.  And, I couldn't be happier that they're popping up in Cleveland.

Umami Moto is great. Super friendly and fast service. Delicious Asian-infused variety. Inexpensive.

Would highly recommend both the vegetarian pad thai and banh mi sandwich.  Both dishes were fresh, flavorful and satisfying - also, don't be shy about customizing the food to be as spicy or mild as you would like.  You can also get sriracha to go if you please (which I particularly appreciated).

Definitely looking forward to trying more from them - follow on twitter at @UmamiMoto to see where they'll be next."}
{"text":"Pricey for the quantity.  The burger meat patty is smaller than expected, but did taste good.  The sweet potato tots with curry sauce were also great (but $4 for a single serving).  If the price was adjusted a bit or quantity of food was increased, it would get a higher star rating.  While the food truck concept in interesting, it will be interesting to see what changes they make with the retail location.

Edit: The Pad Thai was well done and a decent quantity for the price (9 + 2 for chicken).  The chicken curry wasn't that great and I would recommend something else."}
{"text":"Umami always shows up in front of my work and I finally got my lazy a$$ get out of my cubicle and actually try it. FIrst thoughts? YUM!
I tried two dishes here: Bahn Mi and Curry Chicken dish. both delicious!

Price: i wouldn't consider Umami a cheap lunch but then, for the amount of food they serve, it definitely fills me up quite well!

Food: The bahn mi was great. I've never had a bahn mi but it was huge and delicious and so full of flavors. the marinated pork with the radish made it so tasteful. Then, my coworker ordered the chicken curry dish and it was so delicious too! The curry flavors weren't too strong like your usual curry dishes but it was just a perfect balance. 

Overall: I cannot wait for Umami to show up outside my company again to finish trying their entire menu!!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE of all the Cleveland food trucks! I was a huge fan of their pad thai, but got a chance to try something different recently -- tater tots with curry aioli and chicken satay. Yes, tots with aioli sounds a little weird, but trust me, they're great."}
{"text":"So I think this is a solid 3.  Went back today to Midtown Chowdown...the other trucks just didn't look that impressive.  Today I had the Seared Sea Scallops cooked to perfection.  My only beef is that 2 giant scallops for $10 also with a fruit medley in ginger reduction.
It was good...but a little pricey as Im still hungry"}
{"text":"Umami Moto is pretty much my favourite take away lunch spot. Over the past few years, I've tried more or less every item on the menu and have yet to come away disappointed.

The Korean bulgogi burrito is incredible, especially the extra spicy version, and the pork banh mi is also great if not entirely authentic--it's on a sub, not a baguette. I'm also in love with the curry aioli-topped sweet potato tater tots. Bonus points for selling Mexican Coke!

Service can sometimes be a bit slow but is always friendly, and the wait is rarely any worse than the lunch hour lines elsewhere. The only real problem I have with Umami Moto is that they disappear during the winter months!"}
{"text":"I don't care if the concept of food trucks is a fad or not. With a fad this good, I don't mind if there's a food truck on every corner, everywhere I go, choking our cities in traffic and smog. If that means that I can get food as delicious as what I got at Umami Moto, then SO BE IT. (Also, all fads aren't necessarily bad. Take hot pants, for example.)

Umami Moto parked right across the street from my workplace yesterday. This in itself was a great thing, as I work in a drab office park in Beachwood where the only food option within walking distance is Big Lots. I ordered the bahn mi, which was excellent and slightly greasy and delicious. I wolfed down the whole thing in record time. As an appetizer, I got two cheese steak egg rolls -- I really should have ordered ten, that was how many I could have eaten. Crispy and succulent and decadent -- I can't come up with enough adjectives on how much I now worship these little things. A friend of mine got the pad thai, which I'll try to get next time -- it looked awesome.

Checking out their Web site, it looks like Tuesday might be their new hang-out spot in Beachwood, which is probably not good for my cholesterol count but definitely good for my mood during these dreary winter months."}
{"text":"Korean burrito and sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"I wish Umami Moto all the best and hope they continue to stay in business and improve.

Emphasis on the last sentiment.

They're the only food truck I know of that comes regularly to my work and they're still better than the cafeteria fare.  So I'll probably keep coming for lack of better options, slowly making my way down the rest of the menu.

Since the inaugural fish tacos, I've sampled their pad thai during pad thai week and their pho.  The last of which alone deserves some kudos--it takes a brave man/woman to try to vend noodle soup from a truck.

That said, both were a flop.  Both had the right ingredients, sort of.  They certainly got the looks fairly down.  If only looks equaled taste, Umami Moto would have it all!  Unfortunately, the pad thai, even with its bean sprouts and cilantro and generous heaping of noodles, came off disappointingly bland.  There was a pointed lack of sauce or oil, that caused not only blandness but my noodles to stick together, forming a brick of rice pasta dough I had to prod forcefully, hoping to loosen it up.  Whole peanuts were used instead of the customary fragrant, crush peanut sauce signature of pad thai dishes.  I attempted to season it a bit with lime juice and sirracha--soy sauce would've been nice--and it became somewhat palatable but by no means impressive.

The pho fared even worse.  The noodles were undercooked and too hard, probably because they used a wider variety of rice noodle than customary.  The meat was appalling--chewy, thickly sliced, almost stew-size beef chunks with all the flavor boiled out of them.  My guess: this was the same meat they used for stock for the broth.  Yikes.  I ended up removing them just to better enjoy the noodles and soup.  Notable omission--no lime wedge was included for the quintessential tangy taste to balance the beef.  And finally, there was  the problematic logistics of packaging: noodles and beef in one tall plastic container and bean sprouts, mint and sliced chillies to add on your own in another.  A few bites in, I began to fee like that fox in the Aesop fable dining with the stork.  Not exactly user-friendly for a dish that's usually served up in a wide, oversized bowl for a reason.  

Umami Moto gives generous portions, uses fresh ingredients and no MSG, but they may have bitten off more than they can chew in taking on the title of \"Asian Inspired Food\".  Better attention to signature seasonings/sauces and scrapping Asian dishes that don't lend themselves very well to the finger-food-friendly food truck setup might ease them in the right direction a little faster.  But I'm optimistic.  I admire their energy and hope they grow into a tastier and more consumer-friendly menu."}
{"text":"Any food truck that offers vegan and vegetarian food and biodegradable takeout containers is A-OK with me! 

Visited the Umami Moto truck this afternoon and had the masaman curry. Wow, was it good! I may have embarrassed myself by scraping every last morsel out of the box in front of my coworkers. The tofu was tender...the sauce had a nice kick...I can't think of anything bad to say about it. 

My coworker got the meatball sampler and potsticker sampler and really enjoyed both. The portion sizes on those items seemed a little bit small to me...but it left her more room for dessert from another food truck that was parked nearby! 

Wish this new-ish food truck nothing but success!"}
{"text":"The Korean burrito at this food truck is Asian fusion at its best.  Very well marinated Korean bbq bulgogi meat, rice, kimchi with just the right amount of spice (I ask for mild), packed into a bulging mexican burrito with cheese.  It's bursting with flavor and quite amazing.

The shrimp bahn mi - well, it was not really a bahn mi, because it was in a sub roll.  In my opinion, the crispness of the bread is one of the defining characteristics of a good bahn mi.  However, I would say that this was a very delicious shrimp sub.

If only this truck stopped at my workplace more often - i'd be there every day."}
{"text":"the massaman curry is divine! i am not a big fan of dishes w/coconut milk, because sometimes it overpowers the currry and is too sweet.... Umami Moto had the most delicious balance of sweet and savory! i literally ate every single bite, and loved everything about it. LOVE LOVE LOVE it! i wish i had tried more of their menu options."}
{"text":"I went for the curry and stayed for the... clams? Yes, on a recent visit, I had in mind their wonderful Vietnamese chicken curry, but their special of top neck clams was too good to pass up. Three meaty sea creatures were done to perfection and sitting on a bed of rice with sautéed mushrooms and snap peas. The peas were a little too done for my taste (I like them really al dente) but the dish was flavorful and satisfying. The clams took forever to open, but they were most gracious about the wait. Usually they turn orders very quickly. That's helpful when you don't feel like standing on a sidewalk twiddling your thumbs during your lunch hour. Umami is welcome in my neighborhood anytime, even when the seafood is uncooperative."}
{"text":"So, this review is basically \"baby's first food truck.\"  

I did Walnut Wednesday, and was in a hurry, so I picked a short line that had a name I recognized.  I picked the Hunky Po'Boy off the menu, and ordered two since they were six inches and I felt like being a fatty that day.  

They were great!  They had Hungarian wax peppers on there instead of tired old green peppers, and the tomato sauce was just right as far as texture goes.  The Hungarian sausage was great, too;  natural casing, with a real crunch and juicy stuff inside.  

I need to try their bahn mi."}
{"text":"The Korean Burrito, thumbs up!  Bit of a line and about a 10 minute wait after the order, but it was a good burrito and I'm now a big fan of Walnut Wednesdays.  Live music and a good selection of trucks."}
{"text":"I've had more items from Umami Moto since my first review and I really think this place does not warrant the very high praise it gets (not saying it's awful, though).

I've had several different menu items since and noticed the food is very salty. The potstickers stick out as being especially oversalted. The texture of them is a little off and they fall apart very easily. The spring rolls are fresh, but the shrimp lack flavor and you end up getting a mouthful of rice noodles without any other flavor. The end result is a bland spring roll.

Once the glow of 'OMG FINALLY FOOD TRUCKS IN CLEVELAND' wore off, I realized the food is pretty plain. Not awful (well, besides my salty potstickers), but not amazing.

They really need to change the menu up, I'm used to food trucks having 2 or 3 staples and then a constantly rotating menu. This place seems to stick with the same items all the time.

For me, this place is really a \"Meh, I've experienced better\" and two and a half stars. Rounded to three because I hope they change it up."}
{"text":"Caught Umami Moto today at the April C-Town Chow Down event. We decided to go with the Bahn Mi. The flavors were really good in this sandwich. The pork was very tender, the veggies fresh and had a good kick from the jalapeños inside. I do think the sandwich could have been improved by a different type of bread - for some reason, the hoagie roll didn't seem like the right choice. Still tasty though, so I'm not really complaining. Also, although the sauce was very tasty, ours did not have enough so it was a bit on the dry side. 

Overall, yummy sandwich, I'd definitely eat this again."}
{"text":"Cleveland Midtown has a dearth of lunch choices, to say the least. That's why I'm happy that every Thursday has become \"Midtown Chow-down\" where several food trucks stop by for lunch. 

Today I decided to try Umami Moto; I ordered 2 fish tacos and a \"half\" salad. Everything was delicious, but it's only been about 3 hours since I ate and I'm hungry again. I paid nearly $10 for this meal, so I expected a bit more food than I received. I understand the quality of ingredients is higher than typical fast food, but for that price I still expected a bit more."}
{"text":"Decidedto checkout this food truck during Walnut Wednesday. I ordered the Rendonkulous Rice Bowl. I can honestly say that this dish was devoid of any flavor its listed as having coconut ginger sweet pepper relish... I tasted none of those ingredients pretty much. Very underwhelmed."}
{"text":"My favorite food truck is back - Umami Moto.  Today, I had the pleasure of enjoying a Korean beef burrito and tater tots.  It was every bit as good as I remember.  I had a friend tag along and he has never had Umami Moto food before.  He said, \"That was damn good!\" and \"I would order that again in a heartbeat\".  I couldn't have said it better myself.

So glad this food truck is back in my life.  Bliss."}
{"text":"I loved the Great American Food Truck Race (who doesn't?!) and liked the fact that I've seen some CLE love on that show. Cleveland is a great city for food trucks given that it is relatively flat street-wise and full of great food to begin with, so why not bring that good food to the street.

The girl taking the orders was super cute and cheerful, but they were waaaay behind on orders. I can understand the lack of prep in a food truck, but it took them 15 minutes to get my order out. 

Also, the prices were a wee bit higher than what I've seen for other similar gourmet food trucks in the area by a dollar or so. I was hoping this was due to higher quality but the food itself wasn't spectacular. 

I ordered the lemon ginger iced tea and the thai basil turkey. I should mention that the turkey was ground...and this is why it didn't really work well with the jasmine rice and veggies. The taste was great but the texture and look of the food just didn't go together. Maybe I need to order the Korean Burrito next time? 

The best part of my Umami Moto experience was the lemon ginger iced tea. Just a hint of ginger and citrus yumminess on a warm spring day was enough to perk me up. 

Overall, Umami Moto gets a 3.5 from me. You're service was ok, but I would love to see foods that match well with each other in your choices."}
{"text":"I encountered Umami moto when i was in downtown waiting for  july 4th firework. I got the famous Korean bbq burrito cuz my friend strongly suggested me getting it. It was pretty good but i guess i shouldn't really expect it to be really korean or authentic since it's asian fusion food. Anyways, good experience!"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to try Umami Moto during one of their alternating Friday campouts on the grounds of the Islander Apartments in Middleburg Heights.  

Right off the bat, the location gives them some points with me.  It's a drag to see the daily posts from the other local food trucks hitting spots downtown and on the East side, while those of us who toil in some of the other burbs get left out in the cold. 

After scoping out the menu, I decided to try the Bahn Mi and fish tacos, and while I waited for my order, I had a nice chat about the state of the food truck situation in CLE.  Aside from the hot food, they have a nice assortment of chips and other crunchy sides and bottled drinks.  

Once my order was done I took it back to my office and it smelled so good, it took just about every last ounce of self-control to not tear open the bag on the way back.  The fish tacos were good, and the cilantro really brightened up the homemade corn tortillas and grilled fish. 

The real star of the show however was the Bahn Mi. Big, filling, flavorful, and just a little bit hot from the sliced jalapenos, this was a sandwich I know I will crave and need to have again in the very near future."}
