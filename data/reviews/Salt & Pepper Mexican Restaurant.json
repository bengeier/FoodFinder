{"text":"A nice break from the routine of most restaurants.  I've only been to Cancun,  but the quality and atmosphere remind me of something a little more authentic and genuine."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people write about the service being slow- but honestly it adds to the ambiance of the meal. You take 2-3 hours to eat so its great to catch up with friends instead of feeling rushed. The homemade Mojito's...WOW! We had some great starters, the entree was HUGE and the dessert was a guilty pleasure. We also noticed it offers all you can eat taco Tuesdays- the entree already comes with three and I could barely finish but I am sure there are some pros out there :)"}
{"text":"Without question the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant.
We had a reservation that they did not honour.  We were finally seated and waited 20 minutes for a menu.  I asked how long it would take to get our food as we were hungry and the waitress left to check with the kitchen.  When she didn't return, I saw her sitting on a chair in the restaurant drinking a pop.
I had to go up to the counter and repeatedly ask for my bill to get it as we sat for 30 minutes (not an exaggeration) after we finished our food waiting to see the waitress.
The food is not good either.  I eat a lot of Mexican food in California, Mexico, and Vancouver (where I'm from) and this is NOT good food.  It may be the best in Calgary as people say, but there must be a lot of terrible Mexican in Calgary."}
{"text":"We found it just ok. .. never returned..quite small small portions for an the price expensive. .overall. .small and felt squished up to other tables. . Bowness nw one never tried the other. .so can't comment on that one. We live very close but have other favorites. ."}
{"text":"This place is horrendous.  My friend and I purchased several groupons and went for a few dinners. It sucked every time. The food quality is very poor, to the point where you are wondering whether it's safe to eat.  Much of the meat is cheap and old tasting. The worst was when we ordered fish tacos, and instead of fish they contained small bits of random unidentifiable seafood. After that, I learned to only order chicken breast, since at least I could tell what it was (although it was tiny and obviously had been frozen).

Even with paying the discounted groupon price I feel ripped off.  I cannot imagine paying the regular price of $16 - $19 for an entree."}
{"text":"Service slow and food seemed lacking in freshness, perhaps nuke"}
{"text":"I gave it one more chance, but my last trip to Salt & Pepper didn't impress me any more than previous visits there. \"Meh\" is the word that comes to mind. It's not....horrible, it's just.....meh. Nachos with too little \"content\" (they were very sparing with the cheese and mole sauce) and the chips were left too long under a broiler and were unpleasantly burnt. The salsa was obviously homemade, but surprisingly bland. My shrimp salad had those horrible tiny canned cocktail shrimp instead of prawns -- just little shortcuts like that, which take away the authenticity. The decor -- and the menu -- cries for them to be on \"Restaurant Makeover\".  A disappointment."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by my cousin ... it was ok.  The portions were small and not very flavourful.  The waiter was doing his best accommodating all the tables and two needy middle aged women but I expected more for the food.  The enchilada was small and fairly bland the custard dessert was over cooked and eggy.  I really love Mexican food so I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was incredible - I'm STILL going on about the mole sauce. The beer was a decent price, the patio was great, service was attentive, my only issue is that it is priced like it's a fancy restaurant but nothing about the service, decor, or food presentation backs that up. Salt & Pepper is a casual Mexican restaurant that would make a great (large) lunch or a fun night out with friends on the patio."}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican staple for Calgary (no Tex-Mex). We often stop in when we just want to relax and know that the food is predictably good."}
{"text":"Went to Salt and Pepper expecting some authentic Mexican food,  feeling royally screwed after. 
I ordered tacos,  tacos tacos with an extra taco,  beef and chirizo,  friend ordered chicken quisadilla and soup. 
The soup was blend,  tasted like Campbell chicken soup and some chicken pieces with some soggy corn chops on top. 
Tacos x4, what tacos? They were so small,  each taco is the size of a finger,  very stingy minced meat in it,  and the meat tasted old and very salty. 2 chips (literally 2 chips) sitting on top of the bean mash.  What a joke. 
Quisadilla has no real chicken in it,  looked like some sort of chicken spread,  again tiny portion,  unfresh tasting ingredients. 
I'm not sure how they get away with this kind of quality all these years,  I was utterly disappointed and frankly a little disgusted.  $45 later,  without tips. 
Come on,  at least munch burrito gives me real meat!
 
I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday April 12 at 4 pm.  Restaurant was not opened at 4pm.  The signed said \" 4pm - 9pm\".  I saw someone in the restaurant.  I waited 15 minutes to make sure and called them and no answer.  I called the other salt n pepper restaurants to see if this location was closed.  They were not too sure.  In all, bad service."}
{"text":"As authentic Mexican food as you can find in Calgary. The food is good and the mole sauce is great. The service is attentive but a little slow and the portions seem a little small for what they cost although if you're in the mood for a feast then you can always opt for the all-you-can-eat taco special which runs about 10 bucks. You have the choice of eating in restaurant which has pleasantly cheesy cacti painted on the walls or Salt and Pepper is another good choice for takeout that's outside of the pizza box."}
{"text":"Cute little mexican restaurant. 

Nice and tasty Margaritas.

Chips and guacamole- wasn't the best.  Guacamole was bland although tasted fresh.  Salsa was fresh and tasty although a little spicy for my wife.

Had a taco platter, it was ok.  Chorizo was my favorite.  Beef and Chicken were just ok.

The red Snapper fish dish my wife had was by far the best.  If I go back again I will likely order that dish.

Overall decent, but I think there is better in town."}
{"text":"I recently was deflowered by this location of Salt & Pepper. A friend of mine was having a birthday party here. 

It didn't seem like all that from the outside, but I have to admit, the ambiance inside is nice. I ordered the veggie enchiladas and they were ALRIGHT. 

Definitely not the best Mexican food I have had. 

I did however thoroughly enjoy their salsa, and the best part is that they sell it to go! That made my heart happy! 

Overall, a so so Mexican restaurant in Calgary. 

I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"Meant to submit this ages ago! I am never disappointed when I eat at Salt & Pepper. Even with my food intolerances, they are always willing to accommodate me.

The ambiance is cozy and charming. The coffee is pure indulgence and the chocolate cake, to die for! My usual main course is the totopos. However, since I recently discovered that I can't eat chicken, dairy or rice I asked for beef instead of chicken and extra beans. My server was more than happy to modify my meal. 

The taco beef was well seasoned, the corn tortillas crisp, and the lettuce and tomato fresh. The beans were like black velvet, as always.

For me, the chocolate cake is well worth suffering for (since I am also intolerant to wheat, eggs, sugar, dairy, etc.), which also gives you some indication of my love for good chocolate cake!

No margaritas for me today because I'm driving, I'm afraid. However, I have enjoyed their margaritas on several occasions in the past and have loved them all."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very authentic. I haven't had such good chiles rellenos since Texas. It is worth the drive."}
{"text":"I quite liked it. Had better in the states but that's a given in Calgary."}
{"text":"I visited Salt & Pepper this week for a business lunch. We sat on the patio and even though it was a windy spring day, we were sheltered. 

It happened to be taco Tuesday and our server kept offering us unlimited tacos. I was quite full after enjoying 5 tacos. The tacos came with rice and refried beans that were tasty. 

The service was fantastic and the food fresh and very authentic. I would compare the authenticity of the Mexican food here to meals I had in Old Town San Diego.  

I'll definitely be back to Salt & Pepper very soon."}
{"text":"Dear worshippers, I'm upgrading.  Now fetch me some booze please.

S&P still is in need of updated decor , however the nachos were delicious.  The service could have been better.  I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu.  The presentation on their dishes are great and when the flavour matches, I'm all in.

You may continue worshiping me now :)"}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant on a Friday night and it was quite busy. It's a small restaurant that fits maybe 25 max. We didn't wait for a table when we got there at 7:00pm. Luckily we were just 2 as there isn't a lot of seating for groups of 3 or more. I ordered some sort of taco like entree, that was more than enough food for me and was a good price for the amount of food. My date ordered a seafood entree, which apparently was good, but maybe not the value for the $$. Overall, I would come back again for the traditional tacos and burritos. Yes, the decor seems a little \"out of date\" as some people called it. To me it seemed like an authentic/rustic Mexican restaurant you'd find in Mexico. Simple with good food. Make sure to get a margarita there - they are great!"}
{"text":"Salt & Pepper and I go waaay back. I used to visit with my family when it first opened, and was the only one in Calgary. It's retained a lot of the same attributes: it's small, but not so small that I feel crowded. No more so than restaurants I've been to in New York City. Parking is ample. They have a great patio during the summer months.

The food is good - it's not inherently spicy, but if you ask they will provide. It's pretty tasty and a little more authentic than what you get generally in Calgary. It's more authentic overall than the other S&P locations, in my opinion. 

The margaritas are awesome - we had two each of the lime. The staff was friendly and attentive. They treated us kindly even though we had a deal coupon (I don't see that everywhere - once they know you bought a deal, some places treat you like vermin).

All in all, I need to visit more often - it's one of those places I truly enjoy coming to, even if the location is a little in-the-middle-of-nowhere-ish."}
{"text":"Good food, great margaritas, mediocre service...

The food is a decent portion, I tried the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce, and they were decent. The mole sauce was great though, with just the right amount of heat and flavour. The margaritas are great, they are not stingy on the tequila, and you can choose it to be on the rocks or blended.

The service is mediocre at best, and you generally have to flag a server down if you want something. It is bare minimum service, similar to what I have received in those quiet hide-away places in mexico, but in calgary it does not really cut it...

I think Salt and pepper's gained a great reputation years ago when they were the only real mexican restaurant option in calgary. Since opening, their menu and quality have remained consistent, but other options have popped up with better food or better service.

This place is great on a summer evening if you are not in any hurry and have 2-3 hours to wander through a meal, but if you have a time limit or don't want to spend the whole evening out then look for another option..."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place in Bowness. The decor was nice and had the Mexican authentic feel. The staff was welcoming and prompt and the menu had a good selection for choices. Prices seemed like what you'd expect to pay for a dish....until you get the dish. 

The portions were small and the main came with maybe 1/4 cup of rice and 1/4 refried beans. I had the \"Tacos, Tacos, Tacos\" which made me assume I was getting a big plate of tacos. What I got were 3 little Tacito sized tacos with beef inside and a small amount of loose lettuce on top. Definitely not a taco.
My wife had the quesadilla, which came with the same 2 sides plus a sauce and \"sour cream\". More like runny sour milk and the sauce was bland. The quesadilla was also cold in the middle. 

I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been avoiding Mexican restaurants like the plague here in Calgary.  I lived in Mexico for the last 8 years and refused to experience one as long as I possibly could just in case it would be pseudo Mexican or bad Tex Mex.  Tonight, however I have been saved.  I randomly turned off into a plaza that had a Mexican restaurant and thought well, good or bad I have to review it.  But to my surprise, Salt and Pepper on Macleod trail was amazing.  This is authentic Mexican food folks, yes hombres it is the real enchilada.

Salt and Pepper celebrates their 20th anniversary this year, owners are from Oaxaca Mexico and after cooking for everyone else decided to open this restaurant 20 years ago.  I ordered tacos tacos tacos, and a coffee and was quite relieved when I tasted the cinnamon in my coffee, it hurled me back into time.  While waiting, Mexican rock from a very popular Mexican group played in the background and I felt hopeful.  Imagine my elation when my tacos were served to me the right way.  Tacos in soft tortillas rolled, sprinkled with shredded lettuce and cheese.  Served in big platter with Mexican rice and frijol beans on the side. Que Bueno!!!  

But the real test.  Do you have any salsa I inquired? And yes she did.  In front of me was the salsa I have been eating at every taco stand, every restaurant and cafe in Mexico for the last 8 years.  Chopped tomato, onion, cilantro, lemon and jalapeno.  I smothered my meal with it; the chicken, ground beef and chorizo were perfection rolled.  Que Rico.

This restaurant is simple and clean, with Mexican decorative details, there are only 14 tables in this place but by 6 pm, the place was full.
If you want to eat authentic, Mexican food, this is the place to come folks.  

Expect to pay between 13 to 20 for the main dishes, which is a bit of a shock to me so therefore I take away one star.  I used to pay 50 cents a taco but I guess that is the standard rate you pay now at any restaurant here in Canada.  Better to pay these prices and get a good meal instead of an awful one.

For their 20th anniversary Salt and Pepper celebrates with half priced margaritas on Monday and all you can eat tacos on Tuesday nights.  Come in out of the cold and feel the heat.  ANDALE!"}
{"text":"Went here with a groupon. Would recommend margarita Mondays (half price pitchers of Ritas - thee diff flavor to choose from strawberry, lime and pineapple). Shared a pitcher of Ritas, chips and salsa and a Combo platter with the hubby. Food was decent. I should have ordered the guacamole as the app and then shared the tacos ... Next time for sure. The service was amazing - very friendly and super attentive."}
{"text":"I had been to this Salt & Pepper location once before, about 15 years ago.  I thought it was time to come back and try it out again.  These days I'm dining alone a lot because my wife is living in Winnipeg.  I didn't feel like sitting alone so I did the take-away thing.

I ordered the combination platter which had a taco, enchilada and chile relleno.  Basically, it was all the goodness in one dish.  My favourite was the chile relleno, cheese stuffed peppers topped with tomato sauce and cream.  I also got a side of guacamole and it was fresh.

The friendly gentleman kept me company while I was waiting for my order.  He told me that this location gets confused with the other two Salt & Pepper restaurants all the time.  I got the feeling that this smaller, quaint restaurant was more family oriented and still had a grandma cooking in the kitchen.

The food was great and they have Thursday & Sunday specials, two can dine for $25 + GST.  Alone, my food came out to a little over $25 after the tip, but that was OK.  I was really happy with the food.  I have a feeling it won't be another 15 years before I make it back."}
{"text":"Review #5 For Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 

This quaint little place is fairly popular on weekend nights so I suggest that you come early or make a reservation. 

I went for a dineout with the Calgary Vegetarian Society.  I had thought there would be more than 2 or 3 options on the menu, but it's pretty standard Mexican fare. If you order meals vegan it comes without cheese and sour cream, so it's a little bland. 

I ordered the vegetable fajitas, the portion was pretty good, but it was one of their pricier dishes. 

I'm not sure I'd go back, but that's just because there aren't a lot of vegan friendly dishes on the menu. If you're vegetarian you'd be fine."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago we happened upon Salt & Pepper on Macleod Trail. I've been to a Salt & Pepper before and loved it so I was super excited to try it again.

Let me just tell you these words:

\"Gluten Free, vegetarian QUESADILLA\"

Goodbye.

Okay, not actually goodbye. But that could be the end of my review because that's all that matters. Smash some delicious veggies with cheese between two crispy corn tortillas and give me guacamole to dip it in? I'm sold.

Their guacamole was delicious, with a bit of a kick to it, the service was great and fast and it's reasonably priced!

Definitely go check this place out, or go again if you've already been. It's better than you remember - I promise!"}
