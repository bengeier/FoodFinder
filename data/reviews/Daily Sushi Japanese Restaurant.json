{"text":"I have been coming here for many years (more than 10 now) and their quality has steadily been declining. The food used to be very fresh and the portions were larger - nowadays you're paying a few dollars more for a bit less food, and the quality has gone down significantly. 

The only perk is the 10% discount for takeout (if you pay in cash) and there is a server there that is very good (older gentleman) and the sushi chef is very friendly. Otherwise there are much better places to go for your money - its sad this place used to be awesome. Oh well!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's taken me so long to write a review for Daily Sushi. Its close to where I live and I go there once a week in the late evenings. I admit, I have a soft spot for Daily Sushi. First off, the male waiter (or owner??) who works in the evenings is very sweet and very professional. He always smiles. He doesn't write down your order, but he repeats your order item by item after you place it and has not once put in a wrong order for me. Not once. There is a female waitress who also works in the evening. She has a bit of an attitude to her, but for the most part they work together so the male waiter offsets my displeasure with the girl. 

The menu is quite expansive and I like to try new things so I tend to take a while looking things over. I think tea is complimentary, but you need to ask for it. They bring your drinks, soup, and salad very quickly. Their miso soup is exactly how I like it. And your meal comes quickly too. They refill water, and tea and check in with you just the right amount - they are very attentive, but don't push you to hurry up. The prices are very reasonable and portions are large. I tend to go for some type of bento combination - and it feeds the beast in me. I really like sashimi and find it acceptable at Daily Sushi. The portions are generous -- to the point when sometimes I think the pieces might be too thick -- but I do love me some raw fish, so I would never complain. I tried the ramen and wasn't terribly impressed with the broth - but I think I've been spoiled in the ramen department so it would be hard to reach my standard. As for sushi rolls, I'm not a fan of their sushi rice. I don't like the taste or the texture of it so I steer clear of it. I'll admit I'm pretty snobbish about sushi rice so this may not be an issue for others. 

Once you are done, they are fine with you sitting and relaxing for as long as you'd like. In fact, they won't bring the bill until you ask, but will then bring it promptly.  

Is it the best sushi you'll have in Toronto? Heck no. But I do find comfort and nourishment at Daily Sushi -- and they are open till 11pm most nights -- which is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"This place looked inviting but when I got in it was anything but. The sushi chef was nice but the waitress was rude and didn't really answer my questions. I have a gluten allergy and they were able to accommodate me which was great. I paid 3.99 for a salad of head lettuce and strings of carrots. It was soggy and had terrible salad dressings. Even worse, the waitress just dumped the food on the table. I have been walking by and wanted to come in, but there seems to be a lot of other sushi places in the area. 

I will skip this place next time."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and always love it but today, just picked up take out spicy tuna roll - no tempura or spicy mayo - so roll is wrong, but worse than that, tuna is almost black.  A little scary!!  I've never seen that before!!  We just ended up throwing it out.  A waste of time and money :("}
{"text":"Very good value! The location is pretty small, tucked behind a cinema. The lunch special bento boxes will cost you all of $7.50 and will still be very filling. That's comparable to getting takeout at a fast food place, so it's definitely worth it. The chicken teriyaki with vegetables was delicious. Service was fast. I wouldn't go here for anything but the lunch special, since the maki wasn't amazing, but still good for the price point."}
{"text":"When I first started going there the food was alright and felt well priced for the portion."}
{"text":"The sushi here is quite good.  I really enjoy the green dragon rolls and dynamite rolls.  The miso soup is good as well.  I've only had tuna from here once, it was horrible.  Smelled super fishy and tasted funny...couldn't eat it.  Everything else is A-OK though!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to write this review. I've been a fan of Daily Sushi for years and have brought countless friends with me and turned them into fans too. 

After more than 4 years of not being in the country - I returned with my girlfriend from another country and gave her rave reviews. I noticed the waiter who is always there had turned a little grumpy as opposed to his usual friendly nature from before. Even the chef, who like the waiter was a staple of that restaurant for many years.

The general atmosphere from the staff felt like they knew of an impending demise, hence the deadbeat service. Yet, my girlfriend liked the affordable Japanese fare and became excited about it enough to crave for her favourite tempura fare in oncoming days. I reluctantly smiled to validate her agreement of getting introduced to a fabulous sushi restaurant knowing deep within that something is not right.

In the following visit, over 3-4 of them, everything deteriorated. The waiter became rude and would just throw the plates on to our table. We were never given the \"on the house\" special that he became quite famous for. He then began being accompanied by a new waitress - a seemingly nazi styled one who was even more rude and would argue with us if we complained about the food to the point that we would feel afraid to ask her anything else but just placing the order. 

Tonight, Saturday November 30 would mark the end of an era that was Daily Sushi. We were served bad food, service sucked, didn't see THE waiter, or THE chef. Saw them replaced by a new shiny head chef and the nazi waitress. The old chef walked in and out briefly. 

Ladies and gentlemen, Daily Sushi as we know it, has come to an end. It was great while it lasted. 
Adios!"}
{"text":"The prices are cheap for a reason, fish is not fresh and shrimp are so freezer burnt they are tough and flavourless.
Service is awful! I have been a few times hoping the previous bad meal/service was a fluke but it is the norm.  Male waiter that is there all the time is rude. There are plenty of places in the neighbourhood with MUCH better food and service"}
{"text":"This place was my first ever sushi. Since then, sushi is my main stay at least once a week. I love sushi! I do NOT however love Daily Sushi. The restaurant itself is nothing special and service is less than stellar. 
   I am pretty sure my tempura was cooked in the same oil that fried my very first tempura years ago. Yuck. It's pretty rare I do not finish my bento. 
   Daily Sushi, thanks for introducing me to the world of sushi years ago and today thank you for reminding me what good sushi SHOULD taste like."}
{"text":"Great for lunch! Fast, friendly service and good food"}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant for many years.  It is consistent and the sushi is quite large.  Miso soup, salad and tea are standard if you eat in and so are cut up oranges as dessert.

It has what you what for a bento box and their lunch specials are really good value.  Spicy salmon roll is really good, they give about 8 or so."}
{"text":"A great $11 dinner!
I was craving sushi and was ready to head a few blocks towards downtown but on a whim I tried this place out. It was a good tasting sushi experience with some good hot wasabi!

I got the Toronto roll I think (avocado and eel) and it was a delight. The Quebec roll was not so great. I'll get different ones last time.

One thing to note is that you'll get a 10% discount if you get your meal to go!"}
{"text":"I ordered their spring rolls on their 'daily special' menu that claimed to have 6 pieces but it turns out it is actually 3 pieces of spring rolls, just cut in half.. little deceiving if you ask me.."}
{"text":"I dig it. It's not my favourite, but their sushi is solid and I would definitely come back if I were in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is a good little spot.  There's a lot of sushi competition in this area,  but I think these guys do a good job. Their sushi is good and they have great prices.  They also have other Japanese dishes and pretty hefty bowls of soup. 

The staff is very attentive and nice (in a very strange way... It's hard to explain unless you go there) they always give us complementary food or drinks,  usually something small like spring rolls or green tea,  but still it's a nice gesture.

Overall very welcoming. Definetly a place to try."}
{"text":"Laziness on my part (I live too close to this restaurant) and fabulous take-out prices draw me to this restaurant at least once a week.  Ordering $4 worth of appetizers for take-out? \"see you in 10 minutes!\" Ordering $85 worth of party trays? \"see you in 10 minutes!\"  Services are welcoming and quick, making it undeniably an easy choice whenever I need fish.

Casual dining foods have consistent production, ie: futo makis, specialty rolls, etc. Bento boxes and set lunches are the best in this place.  For $10 after taxes, you can get soup, salad, terriyaki, side of dumplings or california rolls, AND shrimp/veggies tempura.  That's a lot of food!! When dining in, the services are great.  Sakis and beers are cheap, and you always get a little something extra for the dining experience, whether free spring rolls or tempura or soups & salads with fruits.

I can't give it all the points in the world because some productions are very inconsistent.  One day your beef teriyaki consists of stir-fried steak cutlets toppling over a bed of rice, the next day the exact same order may yield a piece of dry steak, cut into strips, served with a side of sprouts and a side of rice.  One day a sushi order will yield giant slabs of fresh meat, the next an order will show up with a thin meat coating over a hunk of rice.  At odd times (not often, but more than once or twice) the rolls may not look too fresh.

I'd go back there with friends just to hang out because it's a comfortable place to be at, but it's not the place I'd end up at on date nights."}
{"text":"Got take-out sushi from here yesterday and I loved! It turns out a lazy bum has to wait 45 minutes for delivery and a hungry bum has to wait 10 minutes for pick up. My friend and I were ravenous AND feeling lazy but hunger won out. We went for the pick up. 

Sure enough, about 15 minutes after calling, we walk right in, are greeted immediately and given our food. They totally get that we want to pay separately, even though we ordered together and we get TWO shopping bags of sushi. What? We thought just one of them was for us! I got the Ichiban Maki Set and my friend got her Hockey Combo; that doesn't sound too extravagant and yet it was! 

For about 15 dollars plus tax and tip, I got miso soup, salad, and three rolls of the good stuff: spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll and an LA roll (salmon, crab, cucumber and roe). That's amazing! If I were to order these things separately it would have set me back way more. And my friend with the larger bag? Her combo was a dollar cheaper and she loved every minute of it. 

Upon bringing it home, everything stayed put nicely aside from some miso spillage. The miso soup was great with just the right amounts of green onion, tofu and seaweed. The salad was on the small side but refreshing. All the rolls were very fresh and delicious; my only complaint would be that the spicy tuna roll could have had a bigger kick. 

I've come here once before for a sit down meal and now I know I can go with either option and be perfectly satisfied."}
{"text":"I went today for a business lunch and I was very impressed with the selection and the specials. For $7.95, the 5 different lunch combos offered are really excellent value. My guest and I arrived at noon and got a table no problem. As the hour professed, the restaurant totally filled up but service was quite consistent even though there seemed to be only 1 waiter. Paying took a little longer than I would have liked because of the 1 waiter and 1 CC machine. But overall... That is fine. 

I had the salmon teriyaki special and it was pretty good. The salmon was probably a little over cooked but the cucumber rolls were nice as was the tempura vegetables. I would really like to try their maki next time."}
{"text":"Passed by it and decided to give them a try. It's a small, but cozy restaurant. I found the food affordable and plenty. They gave us dumplings on the house and when we got the bill they gave us complimentary oranges too. Very polite and responded in very timely manner. 

Don't be afraid to give them a try."}
{"text":"The dinner combos are really good- lots of good food for a very good price. I've had the Hockey Combo twice and I love it. My husband likes the rolls. I've only had take out but the place itself seems really nice, quiet and intimate. The waiters have always been very kind to us."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi gem in downtown Toronto! If you dine-in, the owner often serves you a dish on the house and take out is ALWAYS hot, quick service, and 10% discount! Love the affordable lunch combos too. Their teriyakis are my favourite!"}
{"text":"I was unimpressed with all aspects of my lunch here. The food was obviously not authentic or particularly fresh or innovative. The waiters were on what appeared to be a group lunch break when I entered. They were eating and talking and begrudgingly one of them got up to hand me a menu, as she was still chewing her food. She then asked me if I wanted something to drink, as she talked with her mouth full. Great first impression. I won't be coming back, although it was pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Super delicious Sushi that never get before. Very very good buffet, my GF and I love this restaurant very much. But one of the waitress are not good, she always looks angry."}
{"text":"Such a disappointing experience. My husband had gone here a week prior and gotten a sushi set, and paid w VISA. He said he got 10% discount. Cool. I stopped by for take out and ordered a party tray and two eel hand rolls.  They handed me a bill with no discount, despite all the signs posted and on the menu. I asked if I got 10% off for take out. She said the discount doesn't apply to party trays, only regular non-tray items. So I asked, doesn't that mean my eel hand rolls would have ten percent off? She then spoke to her colleague in another language and said, only discount if you pay cash. OK so now you're clearly just making rules up.  Stubborn as I am and pissed they were just switching their own rules on me when I was about to drop down $70, I said fine then ring in the hand rolls separately and I'll pay cash for them. So yeah I got .70 cents back from that little discussion. 

I asked for more soy sauce and she mocked me and was like, why would you need more can't you see how much there is? She actually said this out loud to my face.

Sushi ended up falling apart when you went to pick it up, and the maki weren't as advertised (no spicy salmon but radish roll instead)."}
{"text":"Snugly hidden away next to the Carlton Cinema, I didn't even know this was a restaurant instead thinking it was just a cheap take out noodle joint. Feeling in the mood for a ramen, I popped in only to find a really cute Japanese cafe with a sushi chef and seating for around 30 people. Gorgeous lanterns adorn the ceilings, and there's lots of little cat statues waving one little paw backwards and forwards.
As I sat to wait for my order, the waitress brought me a complimentary green tea (love that!) and I watched as other people's food came out. The sushi looked awesome, the meals all looked rather large for the price and, as I saw in other reviews, everyone who was dining in received a miso soup, avocado salad, or other random thing \"on the house\". It made me jealous that I wasn't eating in, but then I remembered the 10% discount for take out, and I felt a little bit better about it.
Now, to the ramen. The first few bites were delicious, but I think anything would have tasted amazing considering how hungry I was. After I was satiated a bit, I realised that the broth was a bit salty (I expect miso broth to be salty but I think the ratio of miso paste to water was a bit on the concentrated side) but otherwise everythig else about it was pretty A-OK, except the pork in it, which was UH-MAZE-ING. Beautifully cooked, soft, and melt in your mouth. I was definitely not expecting that! So just for the pork alone, I take this up to 4 stars.  For less than $10 for a meal, I'm totally coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place!

I order take out here quite frequently. Service is very fast and the sushi is great. I normally order the Hockey or Skydome combo and split it with my boyfriend. It's normally more than enough food for the both of us. 

Those who decide to eat-in expect a complementary appetizer before your meal (miso soup, tempura, spring rolls, etc). The owner is almost always working; he is very welcoming and attentive. 

I would definitely recommend giving this resturant a try if you already haven't!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here recently and it was great.

I had the Nabe Yaki Udon $11.99 (tempura shrimp, chicken, fish cakes, imitation crab, egg, many types of mushrooms, Napa cabbage and udon noodles in a broth) and my husband had 6 beef teriyaki rolls $5.95 (beef, cucumber, and teriyaki sauce) and 6 B.C. rolls $5.95 (salmon, avocado, green onions and tobiko).

My soup was huge!! The udon noodles were the right amount of chewiness and were very abundant. I got 1 shrimp tempura and 1 regular shrimp. The chicken was dark meat and somewhat fatty and gristly :( The chicken was the only aspect of the soup that I didn't like. The egg was scrambled with green onions and formed into a disc shape. It was fluffy and tasty. I got 2 slices of fish cake and 2 pieces of imitation crab. The imitation crab was \"shreddy\" and higher quality than the ones that are solid and taste mostly of flour. The soup had lots of sliced white mushrooms but also some shiitake mushrooms and  maybe Portobello mushrooms (?). The broth tasted of soy sauce and maybe bonito (?). It was a bit salty and a bit sweet. It wasn't overly oily. 

I had some of my husband's maki and they were good. They didn't have too much rice. The quality was not that of a fancy sushi restaurant, but neither was the price. I think for the price, it was excellent.

Service was really nice and attentive. They refilled our waters without us having to ask.

The place is smallish and casual. It was clean. 

I would go back :)"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to sushi place as it is cheap and quick. After a couple of bad experiences however, I decided to end my relationship with Daily Sushi and go after the other fish in the Toronto sea. Because I'm worth it.

The three different sets of lunch specials change depending on the day. I would usually get the salmon teriyaki bento, which was about average compared to other sushi places in Toronto (packaged miso soup, boring salad with ginger dressing, salmon, rice, 3 cucumber rolls, veggies, tempura and orange slices for $7.50 plus tax). You get quite a lot of food that isn't particularly great, but it's cheap.

The best part about Daily Sushi is that you always get an appetizer \"on the house\". It could be edamame, soup, tempura, spring rolls, dumplings, whatever they choose. At one point I was going so often that they remembered I could not have pork or beef, and would only give me vegetarian apps, which was thoughtful.

The service is fast, and what I would call TOO efficient. Many a time have I felt the waiter or waitresses eyes on me, waiting for me to unwrap my chopsticks so they can swoop in and take the wrapper from my table. It's a bit unsettling.

My bad break-up experience happened a couple of months ago when the normal male server wasn't working. I decided to break my lunch special habit and get unagi don, which is basically eel on rice. What was put in front of me was disgusting. Cold, lumpy rice with a pathetic strip of cold eel on top. The eel was thin and full of large bones. After forcing a couple of bites down I had to ask the waitress to take it back, and I ordered something else. The worst part was that she actually made me feel embarrassed for sending it back. She told me she could warm it up for me (how? A microwave? No thank you), and after I declined she made a big fuss about it. I've never been treated like that before as a customer. 

Sorry Daily Sushi, it was you, not me. I've upgraded to the hunk that is Solo Sushi Bekkan, about 3 minutes away on Grosvenor. We're very happy together."}
{"text":"unexpectedly nice sushi place right next to carlton cinema. 
they're a bit hidden but totally worth the visit. 
the atmosphere is relaxed, the style is modern urban but with the hint of japanese tradition. 
the menu has a great variety to it and the prices again amazingly cheap for the downtown location. bento boxes range in prices from $8.50 to $12 and include soups and salads in the combo. 
I ordered noodles with veggies and even though it was a standalone meal I got a bowl of soup on the house. very nice touch=)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place received such high reviews. My experience here was definitely not a pleasant one. 

It was about a few weeks ago when I came here. My friend and I went to Loblaws to pick up a cake for a friend's birthday and it was raining. I was starving and didn't want to cook when I got home so I decided to just go to Daily Sushi since it was kind of crowded. 

I ordered the Toronto Roll and Tempura Roll. I had bad sushi in Berkeley (USA) but honestly this place is pretty high up there. The sushi was pathetic. It looked like a 3-year made it. The rolls were uneven and inconsistent/inadequate ingredients. If I didn't know there was avocado in it, I wouldn't taste it at all. The rice was clearly not well-made. It definitely left a bad image of Toronto's Japanese food in my head. 

Also the waiter was definitely going through some serious attitude problem. At one point, he just had this annoyed look on his face when I asked him if I could add on another roll to my order since I was seriously too hungry. The food took a really long time to come out. 

My friend ordered a Mango Seafood Salad. It was the saddest salad I saw in my life. It had like 2 pieces of shrimp, 1 piece of octopus and like 4 pieces of imitation crab. That's what you call seafood? The mango was worst, there was like 10 tiny shredded pieces of mango all together. The rest of the salad was filled up by shredded cucumber. 

DEFINITELY NOT COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my son and husband.  My son was looking at the menu and he took a couple pages out. No big deal!! The server ran over grabbed the menu out of my sons hand and made my son cry.  So we just got up and walked out!!! Horrible service!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best. They forget to serve you tea, don't provide sauce for dumplings, and no trays for soy sauce for sushi until you remind them."}
{"text":"Came here after my graduation at MAC. They have a couple of lunch specials, about 8-10 choices. 

I got the one of the sushi lunch specials, which was a combo of California Rolls I believe and the Spicy Fish Rolls. It had 16 pieces total. My parents got the bento boxes - spicy chicken and pork katsu. The Spicy Chicken Bento Box was spicy and had a kick but the chicken pieces were quite tiny. The Pork Katsu was alright and nothing special. Each lunch special also came with Miso Soup and Salad. 

The restaurant itself is pretty tiny. But the service is decent. Was an alright place to grab a quick lunch and go."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch takeout from here after dining at its fabu sister restaurant, Katsu. I went with the Ichiban Maki set (6 pcs tempura shrimp tobiko rolls, 6 pcs spicy tuna rolls, 6 pcs L.A. Rolls--salmon, crab, shrimp, tobiko, cucumber). The lady on the phone took my order and let me know that it would only be 10 min. I got there in 11 min (timed it!) and sure enough, my order was ready. As I was walking back to my office, I noticed that the bag seemed quite large. I got back to my office and realized that they had also given me miso soup and salad. Not all places do this, as I've ordered sushi take out before and just received the sushi. 

The rolls are soo good! I really loved the shrimp tobiko rolls and the spicy tuna rolls were ACTUALLY spicy. I wasn't a huge fan of the LA rolls but they weren't bad. I say without shame that I've eaten 12 for now and can see myself finishing most of the container by the time this review is posted. It's hard to type and eat but Daily sushi made me realize I have no choice ;)"}
{"text":"My review is really personal here.  I love this place.  I eat here, and do take out from here incredibly often.  The 'combo' boxes named after Canadian traditions, like 'Hockey Combo' are full meals with everything you need.  More recently, I have been ordering the Nabeyaki and Sukiyaki Hot Pot meals, and they are just good, filling foods - especially in winter.  I agree with previous posters that the guy who runs this place (owner?) is just charming and he has one of the most welcoming personalities you can encounter in this part of the city.  So, you know, just my personal feeling about this local eatery.  The cinema beside it always plays interesting films - not always regular fare - to boot!"}
{"text":"I ordered 6 of their House Special Rolls for delivery through just-eat.ca tonight.

All the rolls were quite good, very big pieces. The scallops in the Quebec Roll were quite big.

My only complain is that expected delivery time stated on just-eat.ca was 45 min and I got my food about 1 hour later. I understand that traffic could be an issue on Saturday evening, but maybe they could have updated me or change the expected delivery time so I wouldn't be so hopeful."}
{"text":"Quick hole in the wall. Great daily lunch specials. Good value dinners. Have be to boxes for those who do not favour sushi"}
{"text":"4 Americans on a business trip for the week, we wanted to grab some sushi one night in Toronto and a friend had ordered delivery from here before and was pleased. We went in for dinner and ordered several different sushi rolls and a couple of appetizers. One of the appetizers was rolled up beef and cilantro which was fantastic. Another app was not memorable. I had a miso soup that was decent. Can't remember all the sushi rolls we got exactly but I remember there was a shrimp tempura one, a spicy tuna which was great, a salmon roll and some others. 

The servers working there that evening were all very attractive Japanese women and were quick to refill our drinks and bring us anything we asked for. The restaurant is small, but it was almost full and our food came out fairly quickly. Prices were reasonable. Nothing we had blew me away, but everything we had was good. I'm sure it's not the best place for sushi in Toronto but it was above average and overall a good spot."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem that we've been going to for six or seven years. There's nothing particularly magical about it, except for their unique combo boxes, but we go back for other reasons: quality, value, and consistency. 

The prices are very cheap for what you get and for that part of town, and they never serve you anything mediocre. When you done in, the owner is extremely friendly and remembers repeat customers. He comps with things here and there, and is a sweetheart. For takeaway or delivery, expect equally prompt service and fresh food. 

When we're lazy and want to eat in, sometimes one of us will look at the other and say, \"Daily?\" Always worth going back to."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant a couple times with my co-workers for lunch. It's right beside the Carlton Cinemas and close to College Subway Station. So location wise it's pretty good.

The restaurant itself is pretty small. It gets filled fast during the lunch hour around noon. The lunch specials are decent. I've tried the salmon and chicken teriyaki bento boxes and both are quite flavorful. Their lunch specials come with miso soup and salad.

Today I tried their Miso Ramen. It looked pretty when it came. It came in a big bowl. The ramen itself was soft, but the broth was tasteless. It tasted like water. I was quite disappointed. The waiters brought us complimentary spring rolls which were good. I just wished everything they made were as good. I would come back for their bento boxes"}
{"text":"Only thing that attracted me to this place was the 10% off Take Out sign outside. 

The sushi chef (whom seems like the owner), greeted me and asked if I am paying cash or credit card. I said credit card and he said no 10% then. I pointed to the sign and he said company policy changed. Well there goes the reason why I came into this place in the first place.

Everything would've been better if the food wasn't so bad. I am not expecting anything fancy but for the price I thought quality would be at least some what decent.

Of course, food was disappointing just as the same way how their false advertisement disappointed me."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week.  Soooo good.  The server is sweet and so friendly.  And while you wait for your food they always give you free edamame or some dumplings or something.  Lunch portions are cheaper but smaller but way more than enough for me.   Great place to bring a friend for a lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner after running some errands. The service is quick, we were seated quickly and the server came as soon as we were ready. 

The menu is really cool with affordable combos named after popular streets in Toronto, I thought that was interesting. My bf ordered the Bay street combo and I got the tofu sushi, and avocado cucumber roll. Although the server seemed to be in a bit of a rush, he was attentive to our dietary restrictions and ensured to answer our questions regarding the food.

The food came within the next 5 minutes or so. The tofu sushi was delicious - tofu was thin and kind of sweet. I really enjoyed it. The avocado cucumber sushi was also very good. Apperantly the non-veg sushi was also really good, and my bf enjoyed it.

Great price, fast service and attentive server. Good for a casual dinner spot if you're looking for  something quick, and I bet it would be even better for lunch :)"}
{"text":"I am not sure why or how I ended up here. Actually, I am still not sure if it was all just a dream or perhaps it did happen? I can't say this place is regrettable but I am most certain it's forgettable.

If you are looking for cheap Japanese thrills for your appetite then this is it. I somehow managed to leave this place with a full stomach for under $20 (unheard of for Jap cuisine). To sum it up, proteins are dry and overcooked. Vegetables are a little too al dente. Sushi is.... amateurish I would say. I wouldn't classify the fish as fresh but it's not stale at least. Overall, everything was bland, blah and bleh but cheap cheap."}
{"text":"I tend to order chicken teriyaki if I'm now to the Japanese restaurant because I know it's difficult for chicken teriyaki to go wrong 

But this place is it. 
Chicken was dry and Veggie was oil. Both of them tasteless. rice was hard. Amazing job the had done to make chicken teriyaki so tasteless."}
{"text":"This was me and my boyfriend's usual sushi place. The prices are great, the employees are so nice and so quick. They will switch out deep fried tofu for something else for me. The food is always good. They served us edemame while we waited when we ate in. They also offer 10% discount on cash take out. Love this place! sad I have moved :("}
{"text":"This is a fair place for anyone going to the movies after next door. Pretty standard selection of sushi and fairly quick service which was much appreciated."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly but the food was not very good quality.  The prices are low, so I guess you get what you pay for.  I would not recommend getting sashimi here, you are better off with the rolls that have no raw fish."}
{"text":"Take this review with a grain of salt as I'm not a sushi expert.

The good news is that the service is prompt and friendly, and the decor feels authentically inauthentic (I feel like I'm in Lost in Translation, but without the Suntory and ScarJo) in a way that I totally love. 

The bad news is that the rolls were a little dissapointing. The rice was insufficiently seasoned for my taste and in some cases the nori didn't quite make it all the way around. It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but there's so much low/mid-range sushi around that those little flaws become a big deal."}
{"text":"It's not like one of those traditionally-decorated sushi places, or even modern-looking. It's kind of cheap-looking, to be honest. 

At first I was a bit discouraged by the appearance and the big TV on the wall (world cup match? That looks bad...). But the prices on the menu were attractive and a friend of mine recommended the place, so, why not give it a try? 

I was really surprised by the sashimi cuts. Fresh fish, well cut, and oh very good quality indeed. I thought I had ordered too much for lunch, but as it was so good, I decided to eat EVERYTHING. Amazing.  The lunch menu is served with the default miso + salad combo, and I'm a miso lover and loved their miso. 

Have gone back there a bunch of times, and they didn't disappoint me. Still the strange cheap look bothers me a bit. The next time I'm thinking about ordering take-out, so the layout won't interfere with my appetite."}
{"text":"Very fast service, friendly staff, great sushi.  I'm not sure this is the most authentically Japanese food...it's the sort you'd get at most North American sushi restos...but it's very nicely done.  Nabe Udon soup is terrific.  Worst thing for me is, the men's room is terribly poorly lit. I go here every couple of weeks and always leave happy.  Oh, and they always slide a complimentary appetizer under your nose, and give you a free peeled orange for dessert."}
{"text":"This is a really, really good sushi place. I've taken multiple groups of people here and everyone has been happy with both hot and cold food options. Service is quick and bit brisk but not in a bad way -- great if you're in a rush, actually, like lunch. I can *easily* get in and out of here for an a la carte sushi lunch in an hour. Sometimes at dinner they give you free food (like appetizers and stuff). Even at lunch we usually get complimentary edamame.
Really, nothing to complain about here. The sushi is fresh, delicious, and just the right size. I wish it was closer to my home but being close to work will do!
The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because I've had better sushi at the best of places I've tried, but honestly there is *nothing* to complain about at this place."}
{"text":"For never having Japanese food before, I'm absolutely and utterly HOOKED on this place. Doesn't hurt that my building is attached to it and that pick-up is ready in 10 minutes from the time you order.

For a noob, the menu is daunting at best. But you cannot go wrong with the hockey combo! For $9.99 for the dinner size, the sheer amount of food you get is fantastic! It's not heavy fare either which is a nice change from typical takeout places.

The dumpings are fantastic, as was the calamari we tried as an appetizer. Pan fried scallops left a little to be desired but that's about the only negative thing I could say. The tempura is light, crispy and I love that with the tempura stuff we've ordered, you get one piece each of sweet potato, zucchini and eggplant (YUM!). My boyfriend tried the udon and was pleasantly surprised, but I think he was a little envious of my Hockey combo (he proceeded to order it the next time we got takeout from Daily Sushi). Love the green salad and the tasty dressing on top and the miso soup is a nice break from rice and meat during your meal. Overall, one of the best meals I've had of late.

We'll keep going back over and over!!"}
{"text":"It's better than most (not THE best) sushi places in the neighbourhood. I order a sushi plate for two (I forgot what it's called) and it's HUMONGOUS. I had enough sushi to last for two weeks. It's so plenty that I had to walk down to Yoyo Yogurt (see my other review) to wash it down. Yes people, it's an excuse for ice cream. 

It's rather big place than what it looks like - a lot of seats and table booths at the back. There is a zen kinda atmosphere japanese style - you can meditate while you eat. Order green tea, it will help your stomach expand to tons of food. 

Sooo... here's what I think.. 

Come here and don't be cheap... order good-size meal. 
Come here if you want reason to eat ice cream (need dessert after a heavy meal right?)... 
Come here to meditate... don't forget to order green tea!"}
{"text":"I have to give them points for atmosphere. Everything's what you'd expect from a nice little sushi place, from the uniform/outfits of the staff to Japanese wall hangings and very attentive welcomes. They poured me a tea as I sat down to look through a menu to pick out some things for takeout, and then they started conversing in Mandarin...

Going through the menu choices, I noticed that very, very few rolls seemed to actually contain any raw fish, most of it was BBQ this or cooked that or teriyaki something...

I get home and discover that when the menu says \"tempura\" in the description of a roll, they literally mean they stuck some fried crumbly tempura batter in the roll beside everything else. And when they say \"green onion\" literally half your roll is chopped-up green onion. And there was something in the menu about tobiko but I didn't see any.

It's not awful, but it's definitely not good."}
{"text":"I had the Masa combo which included some sushi, sashimi, salmon teriyaki, chicken skewers, soup, salad, and tempura and I've got to say this place is completely average. Sashimi slices were tiny. The food to price ratio isn't as good as other nearby sushi spots as well."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on my first day in Toronto and I thought it was okay. I had Beef Udon and I thought it was alright, but nothing spectacular. They gave me 3 pieces of a California Roll for appetizer, which was \"on the house\" and surprised me for a bit (as if they were clearing out leftover food to this good-looking asian guy eating by himself). Food came pretty quickly and the price was decent."}
