{"text":"Delicious food, but spotty service--our waitress forgot the cheese plate appetizer we'd ordered and served my dinner companion a green salad instead of the Caesar she'd requested.  The service was otherwise fast and personable (our waitress recommended the Barking Squirrel Lager, which both of us really enjoyed) and she apologized profusely for the mix-up, but there are better places on this strip of College to go to be ignored."}
{"text":"Meraviglioso! Marvellous! Marvellous!

Everything about this resaturant makes me happy! From the service, to the atmosphere, to the fact that I can have a Rum and Pear shot (and by the way if you've never had one, you are seriously missing out!), to the mussels, to the pizzas (the Vecchio Frak is my favourite one)..everything..simply wonderful!

You should flock there with your friends...yes I said flock...."}
{"text":"Food is good .. But service is sketchy.. Also Wouldn't recommend it for big groups. Our waiter refused to add garlic on the pizza and seemed very flustered over all. He forgot our drinks a few times . 
Skip the house wine because it simply tastes like water. 
Save some room for dessert- tiramisu cake is yummy."}
{"text":"Service wasn't that great; we seated ourselves on the patio and it was tough to get anyone's attention. When we finally did get a hold of someone, we ordered and then everything was great. 

We were looking to eat a bit light, so we had the beef carpaccio, and a caprese pizza. Everything was delicious! We also got takeout one time, and had some fettucine in cream sauce with chicken, which was also amazing.

We would highly recommend; hopefully the service will be better next time. This place is usually pretty busy, but I never hear anyone talking about it. I don't know why this restaurant isn't more well known."}
{"text":"Three of us went during summerlicious 2012 and loved the overall experience. We made a reservation the day before without issues and were seated right away when we got there. The menu was great, lots of choices. 

I started with the arugula pear salad, it was delicious! My friends both had the bruschetta and they both enjoyed it (8 pieces). My main was the Italian sausage ravioli with a cream sauce, it was the best ravioli I've ever had! One friend also got it and agreed. The other friend had a stuffed hen and said the sauce and flavor was superb. For dessert we all got something different, I got the tiramisu and found it great, perfect texture (I've made it before, this version destroyed mine). One friend had chocolate cake and she said it was better than sex, the other friend had a cheese cake and enjoyed it too. 

I love this place and will visit again, great staff, great Italian beer, great selection."}
{"text":"When craving fresh, simple Italian food it's hard to imagine being disappointed in Little Italy - we thought nothing of skipping our old haunts and trying something new. Sadly though this was not a stand out.

I ordered bruschetta with tuna and artichoke (sounds good right?) but it arrived without the promised tuna and artichoke (the waitress acknowledged this but didn't correct it) So it was, um, just regular bruschetta... on soggy crostini... AND so incredibly over-seasoned that the salt burned out my mouth and I won't even bother reviewing the main because well what's the point?"}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently and I have to say, I was disappointed.  The food was just \"ok\" and when your restaurant is located in a neighbourhood with a reputation of having some of the best Italian restaurants in the city, you can't serve food that's just \"ok\".

To start we ordered the cheese platter, which was terribly disappointing.  A few SMALL pieces of cheese - which were by no means AMAZING cheeses, 2 sliced strawberries and some baby greens...meh!  All this for $12.95 - my advice, pass on the Italian Cheese Platter

For the mains, we ordered the Gnocchetti Vecchio Frak and the Scaloppine Al Limone.  Sadly, both were disappointing.  The gnochetti was somewhat flavourless and the scallopine was completely overwhelmed by the lemon sauce.

For dessert we had tiramisu which was pretty good, unfortunately, it wasn't good enough to save this review.

Oops, almost forgot, our server was polite, friendly and fast (probably why I'm giving this place 2 stars)."}
{"text":"By far one the of best restaurants in Little Italy! Whether its for dinner, dessert, or just drinks, Vecchio Frak has something for everyone. Every summer (when I'm not in Italy), College St. is one of my favourite places to go in the city, and Vecchio Frak is always #1 on the list. 


The food is absolutely FANTASTIC. Great antipasti...cheese platter, calamari...but my personal favourite...the mussels! It is hard to find good/fresh fish in the Toronto area but I can vouch that their mussels with leeks in a white wine sauce are incredible!!! Their wood burning oven makes great pizza's...the 'Vecchio Frak' being one of the best! (Truffles, arugula, speck, cherry tomatoes, and parmigiano)...and who could refuse the nutella pizza for dessert?! Pasta's and entree's are good and hearty as well.  

There drink list is also incredible. From wines to appertifs, martini's, even cocktails that are served in a pineapple....yes...a whole pinapple! My personal fave is the Principessa....(vodka, triple sec, pineapple juice and prosecco). 

The ambiance is great. Inside its a nice place to dress up for a birthday, or casual enough grab a quick pizza, and you'll always hear Italian music playing in the background. The patio in the summer is great too.

And finally the service. There is not one bad thing to say. The staff consists of generally the same people (the owners are from Italy) who are the nicest group you'll ever meet. 

Highly recommended!"}
