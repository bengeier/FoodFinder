{"text":"Our server seemed nervous. She did not know what was on draft and had trouble with the menu. I understand that this is a new establishment and everyone is new, but adequate training should have been provided to make the staff comfortable with the menu.   Onto the food. The salad bar was outstanding. So many choices and everything was very fresh. The meats however are another story. Everything seemed very dry. No flavor from the actual meat, just flavor from salt and sauce. It was nice to try, but I won't be back again until they get their act together."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star rating. There was no one at the restaurant and it still took over 40 minutes to get drinks. They were supposed to have specialty food for Father's Day and they did not have it. I wish I could say how the food was but no one came and served us. Only 3 guys were serving meat and they didn't even come to our section. I would never recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"This place is just sad. My husband and I went for my birthday dinner and it was very disappointing. The salad bar looked so sad foods were dis-colored, slimy and smelled bad. I tried the crab salad and later that night gotten sick off of it. Then we were surprised with a free with birthday dessert that was bad as well it was soup on a plate but they called it \"flan\". One of the young men walking with the meat had a horrible body Oder. This restaurant in general needs to close down and try again."}
{"text":"This is a place for meat lovers.  The salad bar is a bit pricey at $25.00 for a few side salads and Mac and cheese. I didn't see any takeout boxes going out, and the restaurant was fairly empty for a Friday evening. The meat left an unpleasant aftertaste in mouth. I give this establishment 2 stars. One for them and decor, and one for staff friendliness. Food is not that inspiring. #itsaboutthefoodtho"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was reeeeeally slow. We finished a plate from the salad bar before we even got our drinks. We were there for 1.5 hours, not because it's all you can eat but because they only had 3 guys passing the meat for the whole restaurant and took a long time do them to get around. When cashing out we asked about  the coupon they advertised for Father's day for future visits took at least 15 min to get. It's probably just growing pains of being a new business. Hopefully they'll get into the swing of things as they continue."}
{"text":"Food does not really make up for the really poor service and it's impossible to get drinks or sides"}
{"text":"It was ok. Definitely not worth the price. Food and service was mediocre at best. Go starving and with someone fun to occupy the time between each bite sized serving. Poor attempt at being a Brazilian Streak house such as Fogo De Chao"}
{"text":"Service was very poor. Food was blah at best. All you can eat \"appetizers\" but the waitress came to the table only 3 times. First to see what we were ordering. Did not tell us what was included in the \"buffet\". Came back 20 mins later to fill waters. Never brought more appetizers. Then once we flagged her down to bring the bill she came back to the table. This place is a waste. Not worth the money or time. Hopefully this place will be gone before we know it and replaced with something better."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience at a restaurant I have ever encountered, I should have know. When my husband said the bathroom was discusting that we were going to have an issue.  Although the our waitress smiled and was pleasant she did nothing when we asked why no food was coming by us.  I mean really 40 minutes and never received our drinks other then water which came after we had already need to salad bar.  Low quality food at the salad bar.  I wish I could comment on the main courses but since  not one other person came by the table after 40 minutes we We literally got up and left.    Not my first rodeo in a Brazilian steakhouse but you could t pay me to ever come here again.  What a shame we brought the kids for a unique dining experience on Father's Day.  There should be a negative star for this."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with tonight, I was able to try out the food at a Club Rodizio event; note to everyone to sign up for everything. It offered two complimentary meals which is the bombdiggity. The decor is very classy while not as modest as other churrascarias. I did not use the bathroom but my date sure did and she said it was really nice but refused to take a picture for me. rats... The meats were very good and some were charred just right to get that umami taste that is resonant with steak/beef. The sausage was one of the few Brazilian places that I really like; there were two variety. Several chicken options and what stood out to me was the fringe agri-doce, which was a chicken in a sweet yet spicy sauce. It was very good and unlike anything I have had before. The item that was my favorite no doubt though was the presunto; which was glazed ham. It was superb! A must, the best! the best Jerry!  The salad bar was also quite impressive; they had the usual such s hearts of palm, cheese and cured meats, pasta options and breads and rice/beans. What stood out was quail eggs; I ate a quail. mmmboy. Also buffalo Chicken salad was very tasty and not spicy at all as it had crumbled bleu cheese which offset any buffalo flavor and generous chicken portions. There was also a pork option that was very similar to a pot roast. Crab salad was delicious and a bunch of other items.   Few notes:  I understand this is like Ohio State Day at Cedar Point when all the ride hosts including myself ... 2013 Top Thrill Dragster 10th anniversary crew woohoo... open for the first time with real people and you realize how little you know.  Change the plates more often. We were asked only once for a new plate way too late into the meal. Service staff was not as attentive as they should be and the gauchos were mostly great except for a few were having a difficult time cutting off the skewers and dropping meat."}
{"text":"At least two years ago, Champs in Valley View closed. It sat empty for a while but, in April 2017 Rodizio grill opened. Rodizio is a Brazilian-style steakhouse. For a fixed price, you get a salad bar that includes some hot and cold sides and as much meat in many different varieties as you care to sample and eat. We made reservations through Open Table for 8 earlier in the week and went on Saturday night at 7 pm. We had a party of 7 including two children and two older teenagers. The restaurant was not busy at all which was a little surprising but this space is truly cavernous so it's difficult to gauge. We were seated immediately and our sever was very attentive and earnest. In terms of service, the only thing I would say needed improvement (and I do think we got good service) is that our server wasn't especially polished in terms of providing service and information. In particular, she struggled with a question about the wine list, and then served the wine in a way that evoked being at someone's house on the patio rather than being served in a nice restaurant.  These are not big issues for me nor unfixable ones - very, very noticeable ones, though -  but certainly would add to the overall experience once addressed. Hiring more experienced servers and front-end hostesses to lead and train the current staff could go a long way to making dining at Rodizio a more complete experience. (Again, I'm not saying we got poor service. We were attended to well and our needs were met. The service just lacked that next level \"professional polish\"  that comes with training and experience.)  So after being seated and giving drink orders, a little plate of small bites comes to the table. Fried polenta sticks with cheese, cheesy bread balls and sweet bananas. These were delicious. The salad bar was very fresh and included hot pasta and other dishes as well as a good array of salad fixings and some nice touches, like crostini and several choices for topping including tapenade and hummus. There are people who pay for just the salad bar - to me, going to a Brazilian steakhouse for salad makes little sense, but people do it.  The star of a Brazilian Steakhouse, however good the salad may be, is not the salad bar.  Tonight there were 16 meat options. They included ham, chicken hearts, sausages, tri tip, garlic marinated top sirloin, lamb, several chicken preparations, several other beef preparations, and fish. There was also glazed and roasted pineapple;it came out first with the ham and is very good. The meats are on sword-styled skewers and carried around the dining room by the 'gauchos' who slice off pieces for you. The variety was astonishing and the quality was very very good.They have a nice selection of wines to choose from; we had a bottle of the Ruta 22 Malbec and it was delicious, mildly fruity with plum and cherry notes and went very very well with the red meats and the lamb.  The salad bar, small bites and unlimited meats come with the $35 per adult price. Kids up to 11 can eat for less. There is also a weekend brunch option for $25. Drinks and desserts are not included in the base price.  Ask the 'gaucho' about how cooked the meats are. We had some beautiful medium rare cuts from some pieces, two others were cooked more than we would have liked. Overall though everything had great flavor. The cost of this place makes it a special occasion/date night kind of place (we had a birthday and HS Graduation) but we will probably go back."}
{"text":"First of all I would like to say I'm Brazilian and I've been to many Brazilian steak houses from Brazil, Pittsburgh, Newark Nj, Cleveland and this is by far the worst! If I could give 0 stars I would! We went to dinner there to use our gift certificates we received from my parents for our wedding anniversaries and received by far the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant location! Now we have two gift certificates that are going to waste! When we got there they seemed friendly, but it took us 35 min to get our drinks and there were only 2 other tables with people on a Saturday at 5pm. Their salad allacart buffet is the worst I've ever had! They had a few rolls and when they ran out they did not replenish it and their rice was dry. Their beans looked like they had been basically burned mush! Worse than refried beans! Now comes the time for the meat.  When they came around with the meat they only had enough for one to 3 people on the table and we had 8 people eating altogether.  They never came back with more and everytime they came back it would be the same thing.  Their lack of meat was pathetic and the 3 of us that would get meat would have to cut our tiny pieces to share with some of the people at our table who did not to get any! How pathetic is that! For a place being open for such a short time I would expect better service! When we mentioned that they need to come with a full Skewer of meat they would continue to return very very few pieces of meat on their skewer. The one time the man came with one sausage on a skewer which we had to cut up just to share with the rest of the people on the table. Nibble size bits!  When I asked for the manager the waitress and one of the gentlemen who was there asked me what's the problem and said he will take care of it. Somehow the manager got told that we needed her and she tried to get us to stay by saying that the service would change although we had already asked for better service  two or three times and it didn't change at all. From our free dinner with our certificates we ended up going to Brasas in Cleveland spending way more money than we wanted to but the food was well worth it! We tried to book a table at Texas de Brazil in woodmere also but they were booked! Another location we love. We had a whole evening planned but we wasted an hour and a half at rodizio and didn't even get any amount of food to satisfy anyones hunger and we had to leave there and go to another location and eat because everyone was still very hungry when we left the Rodizio location at Valleyview Ohio. We were beyond angry with the service and the lack of attention to our table wasn't called for especially when there were only two other tables with guests. I will never ever ever ever return to this location!!! This place will not last. This place will shut down within the year with the lack of customer service, lack of decent food, with their dry or barely cooked meat, with their lack of meat. Other then the name this place has no Brazilian roots, no Brazilian workers that I've noticed, no Brazilian atmosphere at all. Also with the real lack of meat that we received, it was undercooked or burned and dry other than the fatty part of it. The servers were clueless about different cuts of meats I asked for, but responded oh yeah we have that then would never return with any of it, I will say the only good thing we actually received was the glazed pineapple which I gave my piece up to my wife since she received a hard piece.  I'm really disappointed at this place at this location! I expected better! Much better! I speak for my self,  my family, and friends whom love Brazilian food that none of us will be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim after finding it on Yelp. We are huge lovers of Texas de Brazil so we were excited to check it out. The first thing I prefer is the pop is unlimited refills and TdB gives you small bottles. Their salad bars are comparable but most notably the gauchos were more attentive.  The meat was flavorable but not too salty as TdB sometimes tends to be. My husband was thrilled with quail eggs on the salad bar. We didn't have room for dessert but we have an upcoming birthday celebration and we will be changing the reservation from TdB to Rodizio!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food.   A different type of dining experience.  The wait staff bring around grilled meats which the slice at your table side. There is also a salad and side buffet. The sirloin was amazing and so were the fish and also the glazed pineapple.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is really good! I don't understand some of the bad reviews unless they were early on when they opened. The staff/gauchos are super friendly. Want more or looking for certain meat just ask. My sister LOVED the grilled pineapple. I HIGHLY recommend. Better and cheaper than Texas De Brazil!"}
{"text":"Service was bad. The waiter was friendly but not attentive. We were not greeted right away. There were only a handful of tables seated in the restaurant which made the slow service very inexplicably unreasonable. According to the menu, the waiter was supposed to bring an appetizer/sides and some rolls to the table upon greeting us. He did not. I asked the manager about it and she pointed us to the salad bar. So this is more than just the server, there is a problem with the management as well. The server was inexperienced. Another employee, served the meats on a skewer at the table. He was attentive but was the only employee serving meats on a Saturday night. The meats were extremely over salted, over cooked and dry. Even though we paid for the \"Full Rodizio\" experience, seafood was never brought to the table. The price was $34.99 per person -- unbelievably overpriced for what we received. The best item that was served was the roasted pineapple. Since, Rodizio labels itself a steakhouse, there steaks had better be the best thing served. This was our second visit to Rodizio and will be our last. This restaurant is not going to stay in business. On a Saturday night when they should have a line of people waiting at the door to get seated the place was almost entirely empty. NOT RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"Sunday dinner hours with birthday coupon.  Do not go when slow. Employees try not to hover... But constantly chatter in large groups.  We were there just over an hour and did not see the pineapple served until after we ordered dessert.  Staff was professional when interacting, but bored. The Cavs were playing. There are no televisions so there were 4 parties in the whole restaurant. We had our birthday coupon out the whole meal but it was not taken when we asked for the check... We got one meal free, but the manager did not add the 18% tip stated on the coupon.  The staff did enough to warrant getting their full pay... The manager did not come by and explain why the tip was not included... So I assume it was an oversight.  Gauchos seemed to be trained to serve beef only in thin slices from the outside. We had to constantly ask for medium. Both whole sirloin and marinated loin were like leather. The tri tip was great if you could get something from the inside of the middle.  All the proteins were served hot and we saw no health code concerns mentioned by the other reviewer. BUT... Both marinated chickens were salty and dry... The bacon wrapped chicken did not use the same bacon as the BLT salad... No smoke at all...   The fish... Oh that poor fish... They only have 1 seafood per evening... The firm white fish was tasteless. The sweet red pepper was nice... How you overcook fish and get pepper perfect is beyond me... It is one of the 2 dishes that make up the price increase over the brunch offering. I wish we had come in earlier for less.  The hot buffet is a mild option for a picky small child. The mashed potato and refried black beans were the stars... The stroganoff had no taste. We debated what was beef and what was mushroom... There was little difference.  Everything on the salad bar was low enough salt to pass the husband test... But the pre-made lettuce salads (strawberry and BLT) were noticably wilting. Nothing inspired the need for seconds... Only the BLT and gorgonzola grape will be on my plate next time.  With the BOGO birthday coupon it was $51 for 2 with no alcohol or tip which was fine... But it was not worth the $85 full price... for that I expect more than well done beef and over salted & over cooked chicken and pork.  Please work out your hold times and pineapple protocol... We will be back... But not as often as we were when NJ was home."}
{"text":"I'm torn on how many stars to give this place. A HUGE fan of Texas DeBrazil I was expecting to love it. The service was nice, and the gauchos were absolutely wonderful. However, everything else fell short.   I tried to call to see if they had a bar, and the phone rang off the hook and eventually went to voicemail. I decided to just stop in and check it out.  The place was empty, but knowing that doesn't mean squat about a joint, I decided to stay and eat.   For $35 per person, you get endless salad bar and meats.   1st, the salad bar. The \"cold\" salad bar items were frozen, the \"hot\" salad bar items were cold. No real selections to choose from. Pretty boring and bland options.   2nd, flip the cube from red to green for the meats. The meat service was really, really, REALLY slow. I was sitting for periods of ten plus minutes waiting for them to come over to me. I was expecting endless meat service.... not a bite of chicken and wait, a bite of steak and wait...   The meats themselves were cooked to perfect temperatures and were hot, however, they were unbelievably salty. Great selections, choices from steak, lamb, ham, pork, chicken and probably more, but damnnnnn salty.  The restaurant had no real vibe. Just glass windows and some lighting. No decor, no tvs in the bar.  I have a hard time giving 3 stars because of how wonderful the staff was. They truly were so friendly!!!  I really hope this place can figure out its opening kinks, and issues and really take off!"}
{"text":"If I can give no stars I would,  Salad bar was gross, hot food was cold, didn't get the meat (pressed for time) glad I didn't, guy walking around with meat on a stick was just a breeding ground for germs. WAY over priced, bad service, felt sick for spending 60 bucks on our meal. I don't understand the good reviews, so unwarranted.  Save your money!"}
{"text":"Went here with family for an early dinner. Hostess was great getting us seated service started off good but went down hill they asked how we wanted our meat we let them know med rare which at a Brazilian steakhouse that's how your meat should come out to start off with instead the meat was coming out well done over cooked the first round of chicken came out very dry and overcooked. So we again asked for meat to come out medium rare it took about a half hour or so before we got any med. rare meat from the kitchen the buffet wasn't that great at all the lettuce look like it was a couple days old and far from fresh the macaroni and cheese was Bland the only thing that was really a decent on the buffet  we're the mashed potatoes given the price you pay to go here I would much rather have went to Texas de Brazil for an extra $12 we figured we'd give this a try since we love Texas de Brazil but definitely won't be returning unless they make big changes to their salad bar everything looks like it was a couple days old or had been sitting out all day and didn't really look at edible nor did it taste edible so they need to make some big improvements here for anyone to want to return the plantains came out and they tasted like they were fried about an hour ago and the bread that came out wasn't even warm and tasted like it had been sitting all day. We asked for chimichurri sauce which is usually a staple out of Brazilian Steakhouse and they didn't have anything like it or even know what it was which Atta Brazilian steakhouse you should always have chimichurri to go with steak. So needless to say we won't be returning it was very overpriced and definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Hit and miss at Rodizio.   The salad bar paled in comparison to other Brazilian steakhouses like Texas de Brazil and Brasa. Pretty simplistic lineup of salads, cheeses, and hot items.   The meats served table side ranged from delicious to inedible. This was mostly due to a lot of the meats being over cooked and chewy or undercooked. When we got the Tri-tip fresh from the kitchen it was perfectly seasoned and a perfect medium rare. When it came around a second time i can only assume it had been back on the grill the entire 20 minutes since we'd seen it last. It was dried out and tough to get through. Most of the other meats came out somewhere in between. One bacon wrapped pork selection came out almost raw. The chicken selections were very good. Glazed pineapple was tasty too. I did think the seasoning on the meats was very good, and thought the salt level was good - which is a common complaint for churrascaria style restaurants.  We had no complaints on the frequency of the gauchos visiting our table, but it was not crowded when we dined. Overall the staff- gauchos and servers were very good and attentive.   Don't know if it is worth returning anytime soon. Other area Brazilian steakhouses seem to be putting out a higher quality for a only a slightly higher price."}
{"text":"My husband Al Brooks planned a great evening last night... we went to Rodezio Grill in Valley Veiw. It's a Brazilian  Churrasqueira  you get an unlimited gourmet hot and cold salad bar, unlimited sides and unlimited sliced rotisserie grilled meats. Our \"Gaucho\" Shawn was wonderful... explaining the different  meats which he brought to our table.... with one hand they hold skewers - really swords - and with the other they slice shavings of different meats and grilled pineapple in front of you. We tried the lamb, sausage, two cuts of beef, pork, ham, bacon wrapped chicken and grilled pineapple. My favorites were the sausage, ham, garlic rubbed beef and the grilled pineapple was to die for. All in all Shawn made this dining experience a one of a kind... seeing as this was our first Churrasqueira experience."}
{"text":"I have been to several steakhouses, and this is by far the worst one I've been to. I will start with the presentation, the buffet menu was very limited, the cornbread muffins taste like they came out of a easy bake oven but worst. The greens looked like kale and was not good at all. We had to beg for meat to come to our table. The servers had no clue what was going on, they didn't know anything about the restaurant. Not to mention a server dropped a knife on the floor and tried to continue serving us with the same knife.The best thing I had there was the desert. I would recommend you to save your 34$ and try somewhere else.Hopefully they get better.But I don't see this place lasting long.Good luck."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The service was horrible! Every server had an attitude and seemed like they don't want to be there. Your job is to get water/drinks and slice meat. It took forever for the meat to come around and when it did come around it was super raw. The men serving the meat needs knife training! feels like they're going to slice my hand and not the steak! Our drinks were never filled, our waitress only introduced herself and brought us our check. When the check can around she basically threw it at us. Never coming back! And telling everyone we know not to come here!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So gross. Bad service. The food was undercooked (and I always order medium rare). What food wasn't undercooked was over cooked and dry. No real flavor to the food. The server wasn't very attentive to our drinks and was going to the bar to talk and hangout with other servers for extended periods of time. The salad bar was ok, but nothing to be excited about.  I immediately got sick in the establishment before I even left, from what I believe was the undercooked food. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck."}
