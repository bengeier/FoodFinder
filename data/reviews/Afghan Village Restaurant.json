{"text":"Went to Afghan Village today. We wanted some take out food but once we saw the food table, we changed our minds. It looked like last overs from the previous day, so instead of take-out, we went to the side entrance to buy some freshly baked Afghan bread. We waited to be served, but the old guy behind the counter did not seem to ave any manners or customer service skills. I told him what I wanted and after awhile he grabbed a flat bread, folded it and gave us a horrendous racist look, like as though we were aliens. I guess he only likes to serve his 'Halal' customers. The bread was not the best and needless to say, we will never go back there again. If you want great Afghan breads, go to Afghan Supermarket on 549 Markham Road. They have the best baked breads and great customer service!"}
{"text":"The shawarma deal looked enticing - 2 for $6.99 but I'd definitely pass next time. They  weren't grilled and kind of soggy. You only have the option of chicken and even then, I didn't really enjoy it. The decor isn't anything to write home about.   The debit machine only works with their phone isn't in use - odd. So we had to wait until their phone was free to put our order in. I'll try it again though, since the skewer platters look pretty yummy! I love my Afghan food!"}
{"text":"I went to Afghan Village today at lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised by my experience.  The menu is clearly displayed above the counter, although they have a few more dishes on their takeaway menu if nothing above stands out for you. I ordered a Wazeeri Kabob Dinner.  The food took some time to prepare; maybe ten minutes, wasn't timing it. I imagine they do not do a lot of pre-cooking. I don't mind that at all, but don't expect fast-food service times. As long as the food is good, I think the preparation time was reasonable.  What I got was a fair size salad, which tasted fresh and clean, and I enjoyed. The rice was a sort of pilaf with raisins and cooked shredded carrots, which was fine. I'm not keen on cooked raisins in rice, but it's definitely something lots of people enjoy, so I'll withhold my judgement.  The chicken kabob was the star of the plate. Chicken kabobs are usually cooked to death, dry and unappetizing. This kabob managed to be moist without being undercooked, with slight charring on the corners (pleasantly so). Both kabobs were spiced enough to be interesting without being so spicy that you couldn't really taste the meat. The shami kabob was a nice beef kabob as well, although the chicken kabob really stood out for me.  I also had three pieces of their afghani naan in a little basket. Their naan is clearly popular, I've seen lots of people leaving their attached bakery with armloads of naan bread. I like it well enough, it's hearty, tastes like whole wheat, and well-cooked, but given the choice I'd probably be happier with white puffy indian-style naan. Still, it's good.  It was a bit too much food for me, and I'm a reasonably big eater. I didn't have any trouble finishing it, but it was more than I needed for lunch. The next time around, I'll probably skip the rice, because it was my least favorite part of the meal anyway.  The service was solid, although unexceptional.  I went to Afghan Village once in their older location in the same mall, and it didn't really stand out for me. This visit was something else entirely. I can see from the other reviews that some other people had less pleasing experiences than I did, and I haven't been there often enough to know which experience is more common. However, I will definitely be returning, and perhaps after a few more visits, I'll be able to speak to their consistency."}
{"text":"I was in the Eglinton and Don Mills area late last night and my friend and I wanted something simple and healthy, so we decided to try Afghan Village.    We both ordered the Chicken Breast Kabob dinner with rice, salad and naan bread ($9.99). The rice had raisin and shaved carrots in it and it was pretty good, not too dry or overly moist. The salad was somewhat disappointing, didn't seem fresh and really soggy. The main highlight was the chicken breast kabob which was outstanding, perfectly seasoned and flavoured, and very tender. The whole wheat naan bread was lightly toasted and pretty fresh for that time of night.  The only slightly negative part of the experience was the service, the cashier seemed slightly  confused taking basic orders and when she brought out things like the salad first, she only brought one and had to be reminded that there were two orders."}
{"text":"Two years after reading a review in the Toronto Star about Afghan Village Restaurant, I finally made it to Don Mills and Eglinton to give it a shot. It was awesome. Three of us went for dinner a couple days ago and we all left stuffed, satisfied and excited to return. The menu is predominately kabobs, meat, and I saw one lamb curry on the back page.   Two of us sampled the chicken kabob dish and the third person a chicken and beef kabob platter. The meat was succulent, spiced well and flavourful. The dish came with rice that had shaved carrots and raisins which was tasty , a side of salad and amazing nan.   I noticed people kept coming in the restaurant while we were waiting for our food and leaving with bags of nan to go. The nan at Afghan Village is not like Indian nan, it's whole wheat, a big long oval shape and doughy. Very tasty with our starter (can't remember the name). Although we couldn't breathe we were so stuffed, we had tea and sampled their baklava (a lighter, not overly sweet baklava). I would 100% return for dinner to Afghan village. While the decor is nothing to write home about, the wait staff were really friendly and explained dishes and took an interest that we were in the restaurant.   On a side note, the restaurant has a small \"retail\" store at the front by the door that carries food products, desserts, nuts and tea from Afghanistan.  Cool place.   http://www.thestar.com/article/307071"}
