{"text":"The best kept secret of the east end. If you haven't already heard, this place is known particularly for their amazing lunch and supper menu being a BYOB. That said, they also offer catering services for all events. It's my third time catering from them and honestly they've always gone over and beyond. Amazingly fresh quality foods given extra attention with presentation. I've gotten nothing but positive feedback from my family and friends about they're foodie experience . I wanted to take the time to thank the entire team and especially personal thanks to Anthony. If you ever need assistance with party planning your meal, he's the one you should contact!"}
{"text":"I was invited for dinner at La Grotte Des Fromages. I was a little dubious: not aware of this restaurant, I googled it. Wait, having dinner at a sandwich shop!?

Well, calling a sandwich shop is only half the truth. See, it *is* a sandwich shop by day. But I understand that they've not installed tables and, at night, it becomes a proper BYOB restaurant, with great, high quality food.

We started with antipastu: a great selection of homemade italian salami, prosciutto and bruschetta. The salami was exceptional, the prosciutto was perfect (not too salty), and the bruschetta tasted fresh.

Then came our appetizers. I took the caprese salad: big slices of fresh, ripe and flavourful tomatoes, with thick slices of fresh mozzarella that did not taste watery as some cheap mozzas do, and a yummy pesto dressing. My girlfriend took the arugula, raddichio and fennel salad, which was as excellent.

For the main course, I took the rack of lamb. It was served with grilled vegetables. The lamb was excellent, perfectly pink and tender. The only downside was the portion: very small portion of lamb for a plate that wasn't exactly cheap at $25. My girlfriend took the seafood pasta, which was excellent and the portion was perfect.

For dessert, we shared a strawberry cheesecake. They do not make their own desserts, they buy it from a bakery not too far from the restaurant and it was very good. No complaint there.

The service was great, we were served by Vito, the manager.

The other negative thing I could say is the lighting. Way too bright, which is mighty fine for their day business, but I'd like the lighting to be more dimly lit at night for a cosier atmosphere.

I would definitely go back if I was in the area. Great little find!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the cities best \"Bring Your Own Wine\" places in the city. You can't go wrong with the amazing Rib Steak; for just 35$ it's the most bang for your buck. The funny thing is that a place named Grotte Des Fromages don't offer Blue Cheese on your steak. 

You can stay away from the Desserts; put that money into an appetizer or a bomb ass bottle of wine instead."}
