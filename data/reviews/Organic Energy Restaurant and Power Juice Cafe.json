{"text":"I am a fairly picky foodie, and I think the food is actually quite good here. I've tried their soups, sandwiches, and juices, and like them all. They actually use a gear juicer (not the kind that uses centrifugal force) which produces a fresher tasting juice. I think their flavors are, generally, great, and it's a nice menu.  On the other had, the ambiance is just awful. What they call decor is a couple of empty boxes of organic apples, some ancient magazines and flyers, and some so-so artwork. The folks that work there are hit or miss: sometimes quite friendly and accommodating, sometimes kinda weird. I suspect training is inconsistent.  And yes, it's weird that they serve everything in throw away containers. Styrofoam cups for coffee / tea to drink there? Pretty lame. I don't know how they stay in business, there is never anyone there when I go.  Again, I think the food is really quite good, and am grateful for having the juice options. But I am not inspired to stick around the joint. It feels like the basic atmosphere is being totally overlooked/neglected. Could be so much more."}

{"text":"Here's the scoop with this joint- it's quirky in a way that just doesn't fit with the owner of the restaurant.  The owner is the guy who makes your lunch and he's really not very friendly.  He's a salt-of-the-earth kinda guy and the restaurant looks like people wearing power crystals and smelling of patchouli.  I get that they are selling organic goods in there, but that doesn't mean that it has to be far-out man.  Anyhow, I go here because I know it is good for me.  Some of the stuff is good, but nothing is absolutely delicious.  I have been there with many people and most leave saying their food was \"okay,\" probably trying to make me feel better for having dragged them there.  But I keep going back and trying different things.  The juices and smoothies are pretty good.  I think that you are safe ordering just about any of them, and I think I have ordered all of them.  Usually I run into at least one bad one at a juice bar, but these are vetted out pretty well.    One thing that always stood out as something really strange about this place is that they serve all organic food, but everything they serve it in is plastic or styrofoam.  I know it takes a little effort, but there are plenty of alternatives out there- and for people that dine in, give them plates and metal forks that can be washed.  There's no recycling bin in the joint, so my guess is that everything goes into the trash.  Seems like a bit of a disconnect to me.  This is the bottom line- if you are looking for a really healthy lunch, go here.  If you are a die hard vegetarian, go here.  If you don't have a juicer or a blender and want juice or a smoothie, go here.  If you are looking for something tasty that isn't terrible for you, grab a sandwich next door at Miles Market."}
{"text":"I LOVE the OEC and could eat here 7 days a week. The Miles Road location is the original and best. Yes, the Chagrin Falls location suffers from inconsistency, but even with that it is the healthiest thing in that town to eat (and the Hartzler Ice-Cream is uniquely Ohio). Tom is the chef owner, based at the Miles road location and he can be a little gruff at times, but the soup selection and food make it worth the risk.  ALWAYS order a soup. They are amazing. Try something different whenever possible. I usually get 2-4 soups to take home with me, they are easy to heat up and delicious. Most are Vegan/Vegetarian unless they have something obvious like chicken in the name.  The smoothies are delicious, I tend to ask for them \"cold,\" because they are more refreshing. These could easily be a meal!!! You can not get a soup, smoothie and meal. You might find the salad as a smoothie shockingly good (I believe it is called the green goddess). If you are into juice, you are going to be glad you found this oasis on Miles Road (crappy mall next to Miles Market).  The salads always look a little too healthy and not very exciting too me. I have tasted the dressings and they are good. For me, it is all about the paninis. They are best served hot, with a slight crisp to the bread and Tom has got that right. I don't eat fish these days but the tuna artichoke is \"off the hook.\" There is usually a portabello Special and I will eat this any day of the week. It is kind of like a burger to a vegetarian like myself.  The Sides. These are always strange, usually packed with flavor and interesting to eat. These are not Fries or boring dry cous cous. These are almost always healthy small servings that kind of just hit the spot.   What else? Service time varies, but be patient. Tom is actually cooking and prepping your food. You are getting freshly made food to order. That is truly living the high life. Experiment! I have been working my way thru the menu and it forces me to leave my comfort zone, experiencing different if not better flavors."}
