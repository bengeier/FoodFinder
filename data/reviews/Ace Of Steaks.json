{"text":"I personally would like to thank Will for the excellent service, the food was phenominal, the appetizers were great. I'm not big on Kosher food but to be honest, If ur looking for a great steak or some really good food in general this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure most of the 5-star reviews are from friends and family of the owners. The service staff is poorly trained and the food is mediocre at best.   The ribeye is a very thin cut and the fat was not rendered properly, so it was chewey. They need to use a thicker cut and teach the cooks how to render fat on a steak.   The brisket was average and served with what tasted like (and probably was) powdered/canned gravy and served with a paltry side of soggy veggies.   The biggest issue, however was that my colleague's chicken milanaise was served uncooked in the center (not just pink, but jelly-like raw). The reason it was raw in the center is because the cooks haven't been trained to pound the chicken breast down to an even thcikness, so the breast was much thicker in the center (football shaped) and won't cook evenly. We alerted a nearby server who took the dish away.   At this point you would expect a manager to get involved, but the staff had apparently not been trained sufficiently, and we waited almost 15 minutes until my colleague requested that the order be cancelled entirely. The staff took the chicken off the check, but no other apology or compensation was offered to my colleague.   Here's the problem with this. Staff should never be able to remove items from a check, only management (which is how 99% of restaurant Point of Sales are set up). So I would be willing to bet that a manager removed the item from the check, yet failed to investigate why. This exudes a lack of training and/or unprofessional management.   My colleague's mother, upon is paying the bill, expressed her dissatisfaction to our server at which point he asked if we wanted a manager to visit (he shouldn't even need to ask at this point, but instead just inform us that he would be getting a manager involved). The manager apologized (in a somewhat unprofessional manner, saying she was upset about what happened and was going to lay into the kitchen staff), but that was it no other offer or compensation. So my other colleague left a bad review here (which was deserved).   As we were leaving, the owner/manager chased us down and asked if we left a negative review. She then rudely asked us to remove the review (so of course I'm doubling down) because it hurts their business. Well, if you don't want bad reviews, train your staff properly, train your cooks properly  She had the option, at this point to tear up our check and refund it, accept full responsibility for the substandard food and service, at which point she wouldn't have even had to ask us to take down the review because we would have changed it to 5 stars volunatarily.   Moral of the story, its not the screw ups that define you, but how you handle them."}
{"text":"Amazing food. But most importantly, impecable service. Will go back every single time I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"My son who is a hamburger aficionado said \"the monster Burger was the best burger I've ever had.\" I had the 19 ounce ribeye steak which was also  tremendous and very well flavored. My wife had the the fall off the bone juicy delicious ribs which were exactly as described. Service was terrific. Our waiter definitely gave us excellent advice  as to what was best to order."}
{"text":"My husband & I never get privacy at restaurants in our home town. It was so nice to finally get that tonight. Ace of steaks is the perfect combination of high class & totally feel comfortable walking in wearing jeans kinda place. We would come back in a heartbeat.   My only problem with this restaurant is that everything looks so good and I couldn't order it all.  I guess we'll have to make another trip out here."}
{"text":"This place is an ace in the hole. The steak and kabob is so succulent and juicy, the pillowy aromatic rice is the perfect mop for all the flame kissed goodness. Seasoned to perfection with the house blended spices -- you can't go wrong. Mix in the grilled veggies and you have it all. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The food gets better here with every visit. Always amazing and always raising the bar! Great service and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"SUPERBOWL PARTY! Ellie took care of us. Great service! I have ordered food from so many Kosher places in Vegas and Ace of Steaks has hands down the best service. Oh, the food....that also was awesome. THANKS SO MUCH FOR TAKING CARE OF US. WE WILL BE BACK FOR MORE. Those Poppers.....YUM Best, Zach"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Finally! The best Kosher restaurant there ever was in Vegas.  Great service, reasonable prices, great atmosphere.  Manager Will is very helpful."}
{"text":"What a great find! I was in Vegas for a business trip, and ate at this restaurant -- it's awesome!  My salad and steak were delicious, and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place. Flat kosher food that is fantastic is hard to come by. I definitely recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing and delicious kosher restaurants in the US!  Freshly prepared dishes, wholesome ingredients, super attentive service and out of this world food, simply the best. I am extremely picky when it comes to restaurants and Ace of Steaks goes above and beyond any expectations.   I had the pleasure to dine here a couple of times during my stay in Vegas and the quality of the food and the service were just perfect. You can see that there is lots love and passion invested in this restaurant. The owners truly care to offer their customers an outstanding experience.  Ace of Steaks is located on Sahara fairly close to the strip, so you don't have to travel to the outskirts of Vegas to eat kosher.  Most of the dishes are Persian from various kabobs to tahdigs and stews as well as steaks and a flare of Italian like their fantastic flat breads.  Their Persian dishes are freshly made and delicious, all their meats have great flavors and simply melt in your mouth.  I loved everything I ordered, but my favorite dishes were their Shish Kabok and their Soltani, which is a skewer of shish kabob and a sweker of ground beef koobideh kabob.  They had 3 dessert options, I tried two of the cakes, the Chocolate Lava Cake and the Pecan Bread Pudding and they were so good I couldn't believe they were parve.  The servers were very professional and they went out of their way to make sure I was happy with my meals, you don't see it often at kosher restaurants.  All in all I can't wait to visit Vegas again, just so I can eat at Ace of Steaks. Their Persian food beats any kosher Persian restaurant I have ever tried even in New York and LA."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. Avoid if you can!  We went to this location for an event with around 10 people. After we ordered it took 45 minutes before the first set of entrees came out. 3 people got their dishes and then the rest of us waited 10 more minutes before we got the rest. All food should be brought out at the same time. The quality of the food was sub par for the price you pay. Gravy looked and tasted like it came out of a pre-made pack. Veggie portions were minimal. The food was not prepared properly for some of us and had to be sent back. They forgot some of our food that had to be removed from the bill later. Then when we ordered dessert, again, they brought out the dishes at different times. The desserts should be even easier to bring out at the same time!  The worst part of the experience was that the fact that two of us were very nauseous the next day.  DO NOT GO HERE AND EXPECT A GOOD EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"YES, YES AND YES!!! Went there a few days ago for early dinner. We were hungry and in a hurry. The place is fairly new and feels very warm. The owners (especially the lady, Ellie) greeted us and spent some time with us to tell us about their story. The service overall was outstanding. The best I've ever witnessed in Kosher LV joints.  Now, the food: A-MA-ZING. Super fresh, came out 10 minutes after ordering. Ordered a number of things: sliders, flat bread, koobideh, chicken... All dishes very succulent. The meat was extremely tender and everything else was just cooked and presented to perfection. Felt extremely satisfied and so did the wife. I sincerely recommend to both locals and visitors. You will NOT find a better place than Ace of Steaks. Congratulations and please, oh please, do NOT change anything!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and Im happy I did! Authentic Persian cuisine with prime glatt kosher availability is unheard of. 3rd prime glatt kosher steakhouse is ever in the states! The vibe is elegant and it's advisable to dress respectfully even though not required. I was semi casual at dinner.  So I ordered a half chicken kabob half shish kabob and they accidentally gave me the Barg when I modified my order. They were soooo nice to bring it for me on the side and allow my modification without a fee. I loved how excellent the rice was made and the half Salad Israeli style option. Portions are very large and easily shareable. Also, the tea is freshly made Iranian style! I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We got the tahdig and Moroccan cigars to start, and they were both delicious! The BBQ ribs were so soft and melted in my mouth! Also got a 10 oz rib eye which was cooked perfectly! Also nice that I could enjoy a glass of wine with my meal. Will definitely return next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Vegas is one of the leading areas that hosts some of the largest conferences and events in the world and draws in every ethnic, cultural and religious person too! And yet, Kosher food options are slim pickings round these parts!  Everyone who is anyone was telling me to visit newcomer Ace of Steaks since they opened in the fall and I was a bit hesitant to do so since I've had many misses with \"just opened\" establishments. Nonetheless, I headed off during lunch time to see what all the hype was about. Here is why I believe they will be successful. We judge an establishment by how it looks decor wise/cleanliness, how we are treated from the minute we walk in the door and obviously the food.  Ellie and Moshe painstakingly looked at what they didn't like about from their personally experiences being restaurant patrons and made sure not to have those mistakes happen here.  Decor is very modern with clean lines and a bit of Vegas history in the mix: the leather booth seats in the restaurant were hand made by the same designer who made the large ship in front of Treasure Island Casino. They are also planning on helping local Vegas artists by displaying their paintings on the restaurant walls to help them sell as well.  Their staff, actually enjoys working here. Ellie personally drives home the fact that this is a family team effort and that every member of her house matters. I loved that when I asked my server Rubi, what she recommended from the menu, she didn't just point to the most expensive item on it, but she suggested things that she really enjoyed trying and why. It made me want to try more items than one person dining solo could nor should.  We eat with our eyes before we eat with our stomach. Presentation of each dish was thoughtful and beautiful. Ellie explained how dishes were served in a different way at first but through trial and error and trend, they started to change it up a bit and it works really well here.  Everything I had for lunch reminded me of meals I've had at the dinner tables of my LA Persian friend's parent's homes (and yes there is a difference btwn East coast and west coast Persian food!). The dips: Matbucha, Hummus, babsganoush, candied walnut coleslaw, the Tahdig with the flavorful Ghorme and Gheymeh stews, Variety of kabobs, the cumin laced cigars. One could taste that they were all made with love and care.  I didn't have room for dessert but I ordered them anyway! I'm not a fan of pareve desserts because they usually taste off. But I have to say their creme brulee  was spot on, the pecan bread pudding was not clawing sweet and super moist and who can say no to chocolate lava cake.  This is a must go to place when you are here in Vegas! Plus they offer shabbos meal take out packages, catering and more!"}
{"text":"Amazing kabobs and beef. Extremely fresh and terrific service. And this was only their second week of business, when restaurants usually have a hard time getting going. This place is going to be a hit!"}
{"text":"Delicious sweet and spicy chicken poppers appetiser.  Fall off the bone BBQ beef ribs, very generous portion.  Fairly pricey, but worth the trip..."}
{"text":"Try the parve Creme Brulee!  Everything we ate was outstanding!  So I looked at the desserts and thought \"I can't imagine how they can possibly make a parve Creme Brulee taste decent, but I've got to try it.\"  Wow!  The texture and flavor was spot on.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"This was the only kosher restaurant in Las Vegas open on Saturday night so we went here. Unfortunately, there was minimal vegetarian food here - a shame as some meat eaters have vegetarian spouses and friends.   However, the onion rings were yummy and the Vege flat bread was surprisingly good though did have a bit too much balsamic dressing. My wife thought her steak was good but was a little pricey for what she received.  Our dessert was the molten hot chocolate cake, usually a favourite of ours but this one was a disappointment. It came crumbled and had a little overcooked crust. Service was top notch though."}
{"text":"I went to this place a few months ago when they had just opened ,  the service was bad but the food was very good ,  when I went back to vegas last week , I went back and since my last time there , they changed the whole staff and menu ,  the service was very good and the food was great ! this is my first review and the reason I am writing it is because I saw some of the negative reviews and I wanted to give my feedback , BTW we went back there the next night ,  it was that good ! if you are looking for Kosher food , this is as good as it gets . we took a few friends that aren't Kosher and they loved it as well ."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the location, this place has really delicious chicken kabobs and the server was super sweet and accommodating. She stated they normally close for lunch but she remained open and did't turn us away. For me thats a big A+++ in the customer service department! The portions were a little smaller then expected for the price which is why I'm giving then 4 stars instead of 5, but the price is likely justified since its Kosher."}
{"text":"The best new kosher restaurant in town. Fresh meat, Real Persian cuisine like LA's Persian restaurants style.  Good luck, Keep it fresh and yummy"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent kosher steak house. All the food is SUPREME. THE STAFF IS GREAT. Will Mize, the manager is so sweet, smart, accomadating and great at his job. We were introduced to the owner who is so friendly and incredibly sweet. We will be back to eat some more incredible meals."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Wonderful experience, service was excellent as was the food. Our server was helpful and made some recommendations. Would return if we come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best kosher steak house in las Vegas. Gotta love this place. The quality of meat is top notch. The customer service was amazing. I will be back"}
{"text":"The best kosher Persian cuisine! Been to ace of steaks prob about 10 times since they opened. The food is timely and the wait staff is great. I recommend anything with pulled beef, the ribs, koobideh, tahdig with ghormeh sabzi and the bread pudding! Great place to visit.  Also, they have a bar. So what could be bad lol"}
{"text":"Food was amazing 100% kosher with Persian influence. Best kosher Resturant in Las Vegas and reasonably priced. Its my wife's and I first time here. Sali, Will and Emanuel gave great service. We'll be back again. Everyone must try the ribs it falls right off the bone, it's tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Great food, good service.  Probably the best meat I've tried off the strip.  We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Was hungry for a steak.  My filet was Great!  House salad was fresh, crisp and very yummy!  My hubby ordered the brisket.  It was good but not great. Service was great and nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Well eating Kosher food is not always easy. Great place , clean good food and amazing amazing Hummus!!!! Real home made Hummus. Great people and really good on the price . The owner came to ask us how we felt , this is how a business need to be. We will definitely come back when we are in town."}
{"text":"I love it when I see the owner of a restaurant walks to tables and greets the customers and asks questions to make sure the food is good.  Due to the place being packed, It was a little overwhelming  for our server and it was understanding of him but he handle it just fine and did his best to make us happy.  This place understands the important of customer service and even though they are relatively new in this business I see a bright future and potential in there.  The food was good size portion and delicious.  10 minutes Uber drive from strip and plenty of parking if you drive your own car.  Nice presentation of dishes which is essential for a steak house.  If you are looking into some good quality Persian Kosher food or steaks in Las Vegas, I suggest try this place first before anywhere else.  I will definitely go there more."}
{"text":"Amazing service amazing food!  Everything is fresh and tasty every time I order.  I go back to this place every time I'm in Vegas.  Hidden gem of Vegas!"}
{"text":"Was in Las Vegas this weekend for a conference. I had Ace of steaks deliver take out for Shabbat which I took to my hotel. Food was impeccable. Especially loved the chicken, the deli and the brisket. I highly recommend them. They met me exactly when I told them I needed the food. Quality of the food was beyond my expectations"}
