{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for months and now that it is I couldn't be happier. The food is amazing, the place is clean and welcoming. Prices are decent and Id come here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Just found this small resturant. I really enjoyed it! Great food and Coffee, and not to busy, I would highly recomend if you want to try something new for breakfast or Lunch. I eat out for lunch almost every day, and it is really nice to find something different that is a one off."}
{"text":"Greek salad was exploding with flavor. Italian pannini was beautifully cooked. Nice side salad. Do over."}
{"text":"Latte - machine made, terrible Omelet - microwaved, like airplane food Croissant - overcooked, ack!  Not sure why people rave, all around crappy bfast for $21. Will never go back."}
{"text":"A nice small place if youre in the mood for a light breakfast and or looking for something different. Almost all of their menu choices have cheese so lactose intolerant people should possibly/maybe stay away. Ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich and the sauces added to it definitely makes it pop with flavor that ive never tasted before. Its very original and I enjoyed it. Service is nice and friendly. They have the initiative to take care of you with your eating experience. My order of food doesn't make me want to come back though as its not too surprising or addicting to crave for it in my opinion. But all in all, definitely encourage everyone to go as I don't see anyone being disappointed here."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had breakfast here first time.  this place is spectacular great French food I love it definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"What a treasure !!! If I lived nearby I would be picking up my lunch every day. I had a delightful \"caprese\"panini which came with a small green salad with a very nice ranch dressing. My companion had the 1/2 salad w/ 1/2 sandwich. Great greens with olives (2 kinds), cucumber, red onion & lots of very good cheese. The balsamic dressing was just right. His 1/2 sandwich was just enough to let me finish his salad. I'll  look for this place whenever I'm in the area, for sure. Lucky locals!!!"}
{"text":"Nanny's is a hidden gem in the area. There's no fake-American-French food here, it's all genuine. Lunch was simple, authentic, and delightful, from the fresh warm croissants with tangy marmalade to the savory soup du jour. The owner was engaging and loves her work. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were walking by when we decided to try this cute little French Cafe. He got the Belgian and I got the Spice. The sandwich are big and worth the price. Their made with fresh French bread, fresh toppings, great meats, and are serve with a small side salad. I wanted to try the Madeline cookies but was to full. We will definitely be coming, I'm excited to try breakfast :)"}
{"text":"Ok for lunch possibly not so much for breakfast - limited selections. Staff was very nice and accommodating!"}
{"text":"I went to lunch in this really sweet and super clean place, and ordered the chicken salad. It was just excellent, the quality of the food was amazing, so fresh and of course tasty !!! I do not remember having this quality of food before in many other places... I ordered as well a flan (cake), it was delicious too, so tasty and delicate !!! The prices are very reasonable. The service is charming, and really friendly. I recommend this place for all these reasons. Good job !!!"}
{"text":"What a delightful little spot! The food is fresh and tasty, and the staff is lovely. But seriously, the croissants...they haunt my dreams with their buttery flakes. So glad I decided to give it a try."}
{"text":"Greek Salad was DELICIOUS! Cute place, super nice ladies (owners?), simple menu.  Definitely will be back to try pastries in the AM and definitely will be back for the GREEK SALAD!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here for the second time today.  Had lunch last week with a friend.  We were both impressed with the Italian Sandwich.  Their pastries are the best ever. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, delicious coffee and I had a ham and cheese omelette on a baguette.  The bread was amazing! The service was excellent!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Friendly fast service! This little cafe is nice and quiet with indoor and outdoor seating. The menu is small but they have really good sandwiches so even though they don't do a lot, they at least do it very well. I got a half spicy chicken sandwich with a pastry and bottled water for under $9. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Just Lovely !!!  The food was fresh and tasty. The atmosphere was cozy. We really appreciate the free wifi. A feeling of Europe in Summerlin. We were even treated to pastry.  I hope she can maintain a business surrounded by fast food crap. I will return."}
{"text":"Was looking for something open on 4th of July and glad I stumbled across this place. Walked in to 2 smiling faces. \"hellllooooo!\" They were so friendly and eager to serve us. The shop itself is very inviting and well lit. Feels like a bit of France in Vegas. As much as you can in a strip mall in Summerlin. Decided to try a pastry while we waited and it was amazingggg. Ordered a sandwich and the presentation was very appealing. Very tasty as well. I just love French baguette bread and theirs was great."}
{"text":"Excellent Service always with a smile! Great food our favorite stop any day of the week. We have been stopping by for over 2yrs now and always excellent service. Simply delicious"}
{"text":"Great little spot for fresh and tasty breakfast or lunch. Service with a smile always helps my morning start off right which is one reason why I eat here weekly! Thank you Nanny's!"}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast, had the ham a d cheese croissant with a little side salad, yummy. Croissant was light and fluffy. Coffee was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Firstly, it is spotlessly clean and well maintained. They have several sandwiches and salad selections, along with a couple omelettes and other breakfast items. But the real show stopper is the croissants. Omg they are heavenly, best I've ever had! The other baked good are great too, we always get some madellines to go. The ingredients here are fresh and simple and really really good. The prices are ridiculously low too, and the owners are very nice. we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nanny's is the best. The food is freshly made by Nanny! If you want an authentic European cafe this is it. The staff is kind, personable, and the food is delicious. Our family stops in for breakfast, lunch, or just a pastry and coffee. My kids adore Nanny and her madeleines! They will also eat a whole salad here, which is awesome since they are only toddlers. Stop in and you will fall in love too. This is a local business that is well worth supporting! We adore Nanny's so much and stop in once a week for a tasty treat!"}
{"text":"Recently discovered this little cafe.  The staff is very friendly and the place is very clean.  Tried the omelet sandwich which was very good and fresh.  Second time tried the croisant omelet sandwich and it was also very good.  The portions are decent and service was prompt.  Only disappointment was that Fox News was on the tv!  Other than that I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Frenchfood tante :-)) Very good place !!!! Great food, fresh and simple :-) the staff is very charming and we can tell they love what they are doing !   Une super adresse pour midi les sandwich sont délicieux et les salades géantes tout est ultra frais et le personnel ainsi que les patrons patrons sont charmant !!! Good job !"}
{"text":"Went to brunch this weekend and ordered the tuna sandwich- it was so good! I The food was spot on for Parisian cafes, and my sandwich was both light on my stomach and filling. The service was excellent and the prices were very reasonable.  Bonus: the patio out front is dog-friendly!!"}
{"text":"An amazing little hidden gem in Las Vegas! Fantastic food from a very kind staff, the store was well cleaned and had a cute vibe. I'd recommend this place to absolutely anyone looking to try out a local business. Nanny's is quickly becoming one of my families favorite places to eat in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Cute little French breakfast and lunch place: quiche, sandwiches, salads, pastries, and coffee. At current time, their pastry selection looks a bit limited but the few items I did try were well-executed, the almond-paste-filled one: though it only had a scant amount inside.  Sandwiches are on fresh French bread, and gigantic, which justifies their $9 price tag. Staff recommends the Italian as their favorite.  They also have a lunch special featuring a soup of the day and fresh French bread.   I was a little disappointed in the nonfat café latte I ordered: I'm used to French coffee being a bit stronger and bolder than what I was served here, which was a bit overly milky and didn't seem to be strong. Perhaps the beverages aren't their highlight.  Service was warm and genuine, and happy to suggest menu items to try. Location interior is homey and clean, without being shabby. Not sure this was the best area to open a bakery given the close proximity to German Bakery and the Kosher place across the intersection, but if they emphasize their French offerings, they should do well."}
{"text":"Friendly service good food and a nice but limited assortment of pastries. The cappuccino was delicious, and the croissant buttery. The flan had a good sweet vanilla flavor. The Belgian panini was delicious, I would suggest going with the panini. Wonderful little family owned French cafe. I can't believe Stef V blocked me? A fellow Texan smh"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE Visited on Saturday AM. 1table of 6 on the patio waiting. Our party of 3 went inside. One employee who did not acknowledge we were there as she was cooking. After about 10 minutes, I found menus and we sat waiting. The employee was making one dish at a time, serving them as they came up so 2 or 3 people. On the patio were eating while the others waited. We were there 20 minutes with no service whatsoever. I stood at the counter to attempt to order and was ignored. I went back to my seat. Another customer came in, was greeted, and immediately served a cup of coffee and a roll. We then left."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, great idea for breakfast!!! We couldn't stop eating and they were the sweetest."}
{"text":"So, we're in Vegas for a soccer tournament and it's freakin cold and we want something other than drive through crap. My wife pulls up cafés in the area and Nanny's pulls up and the photos look good. I'm thinking a bowl of oatmeal to warm me up. Nope! It's this awesome little French place with incredible looking (and tasting) croissants and various pastries.   My wife was a little put off by the lack of breakfast items, however, she gutted out a croissant with butter and jam and probably the best cup of hot chocolate I've ever tasted.  My wife admitted that it was a perfect breakfast. The ladies that run this place are extremely cool and very friendly and put you at ease immediately. All with a genuine French accent.  My daughter and I got the egg and ham croissant. When it came out I was a little wigged out because the egg and ham was microwaved. Usually, eggs and microwaves do not get along. But, surprisingly, it was fluffy, buttery and delicious. So, all you hoytie toytie upper crust snobs (Lilly) who are put off by such things, relax, it's good. Really good.  We got an apple tart to go and it too, was off the hook good. Thank you to the French hotties who run the place. We'll be back when in town."}
{"text":"Reasons we enjoyed our visit ~  Very friendly service Phenomenal croissant filled with a ham & cheese omelet (very large & tasty) Fresh tomato & balsamic salad Flaky chocolate croissant Unique chicken parm (not like a typical one, this one is filled with thinly sliced chicken, parmesan, EVOO, and balsamic reduction   My man and I enjoyed our late breakfast here and were impressed with the food. It's a light amount and filled with some very good flavors and you can taste the quality ingredients that are used. This is a small place and the only thing I think could be even better is the decor. I enjoy details and I see so much potential here but it is clean and simple. We will most likely be back when in the mood for some delicious and light French goodies."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant! Love ordering the homemade soup that comes with bread and butter, a steal for $5! Some outdoor seating as well so we can walk there with our dog and toddler and sit outside for a bite and a coffee."}
{"text":"Nannys catered moms 75th Birthday and we could not have been more satisfied!! They shows up early. The food looked fabulous. The prices were truly reasonable for we did our homework. But forget the prices for we only allowed the flavor of the food to allow our decision making.  We had already committed elsewhere. It was impossible not to switch. The food was top notch. They delivered out to southern highlands. The prices were less then half from the original choice. I would completely and only choose Nanny's for catering and a quick sandwich, meal or pastry. Croissants melt in your mouth. Italian sandwich.. The food hits your palate and in an instant becomes memorable. Trust me it's memorable!! Try it! It's simply amazing.  Thank you Nannys's. Looking forward to my new go to cafe. Did I say amazing??"}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab a bite to eat.  Today I had the omelet croissant sandwich yum. They are on Lake Mead in Summerlin. A lot of food for the price. Lunch with tip under $10"}
{"text":"This place is one of those hidden gems. Their bread is amazing and I love the greek salad. I've tried most of their sandwiches and they are all good"}
{"text":"The food was okay-good but the French lady/waitress (owner?) serving us was what made our first experience here so pleasant. Place was empty at 3pm on a weekday so we decided to have some simple, light food. There was only one person working the place and she suggested the new Greek Salad. So we ordered at the register and she told us to go ahead and have a seat, and that we could pay afterwards. Had a good, slow-paced lunch -she made all of our food to order (2 sandwiches and a salad) so it took about 15minutes.  Throughout the meal she was topping off our water and checking if the food was ok, as we finished up she brought out complimentary pastries for us to try. So thoughtful! When I'm in the area, this will def be a great, healthy (or not-as-healthy if you like pastries and croissants) option. Baked items are all made in-store.  1. Greek Salad $8.95- large entree sized salad with bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives - diff kinds, and tons of feta (a LOT). Light, filling, and really tasty. 2. Healthy Sandwich ($8.55)- sliced radishes, cream cheese, and chopped chives. Basic and light. Came with a small side of the Country salad. We asked for more cream cheese and she brought some extra out no probs.  3. Italian Panini ($8.55)- Mozzarella, tomato, spices, and prosciutto-type meat, all panini-pressed until its crispy on the outside. Pretty good, lots of flavor from the herbs/spices she used. Came with a small side of the Country salad. 4. Pastries, not sure what fillings were in them but all were tasty. All were also slightly soft/mushy from being in the case probably. There would have been perfection is they could have been toasted up for a min before serving."}
{"text":"This place was a truly an awesome find! The food was excellent. The owner was super friendly and very helpful. We defiantly will be back. Delicious food and comfortable atmosphere besides how can you go wrong with a place named 'Nanny's'."}
{"text":"Lost in the desert of Nevada, and suddenly you see lights shining in the Valley?  Well, you are not dreaming, you are in Las Vegas!!!  Then, follow your instinct, your flair, because you want a good fresh croissant, a crusty baguette, and you go to Summerlin, take a lunch at Nanny's!!! We can speak French here if you want, the welcome is friendly, professional, and in addition you will have a good lunch. You have the choice of all kinds of sandwiches, hot or cold, salads and pasta dishes, all tasty and well presented. This Restaurant still feels like new, is ventilated, cool, you will have WIFI for free. You can directly stay connects it with your friends stayed in France and enjoying at the same time a nice croissant!! You can also choose to sit outside during the sunny days.  This place is super tasty. It's hard to find great sandwiches, and we find it here. The crunchy bread was a great value. And of course you a can have the baguette bread!!! Your plates arrive quickly, appetizing, and is delicious, accompanied by a good salad seasoned and flavored with olive oil.   I can't wait to visit again and try some of the other sandwiches. Great customer service, tasty sandwiches and great price point. Definitely deserves a return visit. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Nanny's since they opened. Best croissants I've ever had! And I crave their breakfast sandwich (croissant,eggs,ham,hard boiled eggs) on a regular basis. Best thing though is the family who runs it. Such wonderful people!"}
{"text":"Food is great and service better. First time in today with the wife and grandson. Well worth it . Tucked into a shopping center , imagine that. Highly recommend everyone trying it out."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff!!! Highly recommend  checking this place out! The pastries are to die for!"}
{"text":"Vert good excellent food I got panini and waitress was super serviceable and nice  services i am glad I stopped by merci beau coup pour les dessert"}
{"text":"Great French sandwiches! So good. Had the Italian and gf had the tuna. The baguettes were perfectly cooked - crunchy on the outside and so tasty. Fantastique! Service was friendly and fast"}
{"text":"All food business should be run like Nanny's! EVERYTHING is fresh. You will love the crunchy french bread, but that is only the start. My wife makes the best sandwiches I've ever eaten but this has to be a very close second. They are made with care which can't be said about other places. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nanny's was a revelation  to me. I never knew it existed and I can walk there. I went on Saturday around 2 PM and I was the only customer. The Belgian Panini with the side salad was delicious and the service excellent. I even received a small pastry gratis when I was ready to leave. Nice place to come and relax in a very clean, well-appointed establishment. Tres jolie! Will definitely return. Merci, Nanny!"}
{"text":"The most memorable thing about this little cafe and bakery in Summerlin is the service. The folks here are so friendly it might catch you off guard and leave you wondering why more people aren't as kind. You can order at the counter but if you're planning on eating there, you can grab a seat and they'll be happy to wait on you table side.   Their menu consists of baked goods, sandwiches, and a few hot items. The Belgian ($8.95), filled with black forest ham and gouda cheese, was about a foot long, thin panini accompanied by a small side salad. It may have been a simple sandwich, but it was plenty satisfying. Baked goods were hit or miss. The chocolate croissant was flakey and airy, filled with a touch of semi-sweet chocolate. The mini apple danish was decent as well. On the other hand, a flat, limp mini almond croissant was a disappointment with an interior that was rather doughy with an undercooked quality to it.   I love that some of their pastries come in a mini size -- perfect for sampling a variety of items. But, in a town with so many good bakeries it's unfortunate that their service was the highlight of the visit."}
{"text":"I love love this place.  Service is quick and friendly and the food is scrumptious!  I love to go for breakfast. The 2 women that work there are so sweet.  I love just about everything that is served here!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after visiting Red Rock Canyon. Sandwich was delicious and service was great!"}
{"text":"What a delightful place. The food was delicious especially the panini and the coffee The owner made us feel like long lost friends. We felt like we were in Europe"}
{"text":"I went to Nanny's the other day to have a coffee and pastry with a friend.  It was highly recommended to me by my mother in law. The service was excellent and my chocolate croissant was fantastic!  I can't wait to try their sandwiches.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by accident while wandering around in a low blood sugar fog.  Well actually, I was with some friends and looking for a good BBQ place and just got too hungry to wait.  Nanny's is an unprepossessing place and looks like a low end deli place for those who have NO idea what a real deli should be like.  But inside ... Vive La France.  This place is pure French Bistro, mixed with a bit of Viennese Kline Konditorei.  Everything is fresh and home made, from the outstanding coffee to the oo-la-la quiches to the formidable pastries to the fantastique sandwiches.  And the soups are excellent. So, as that great French action hero Ahhnuld once said ... Certainement, j'y reviendrai bientot sans doute (translation, \"I'll be baak\")."}
{"text":"Wow what an awesome surprise! The best breakfast sandwich in Summerlin. Eggs, cheese and ham croissant. It's like being in Paris with an American affordable price!"}
{"text":"Great big and fresh sandwiches ! Séverine had me tried the fig and almond tart, very delicious ! Welcoming Belgian team. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Delicious & clean. One of the best honey Dijon dressings I've ever had. The tuna salad was simple and delicious. I don't eat raw tomato & they were very helpful in suggesting alternatives. I ended up with olives & was given plenty of meaty green olives on my salad. The pastry looks fantastic."}
{"text":"This is a fun little French Sandwich Shop the pesto veggie Panini was amazing service was awesome followed up by a cappuccino that was delicious"}
{"text":"Great place. It's fairly new but the food is awesome. I got the Italian panini. It was a foot long and amazing. I had no idea what Italian ham was but it tastes like prosciutto. It also comes with a side salad and drink. This cost $9 so I think the prices are definitely reasonable. They also offered us some amazing pasteries. I recommend those too.   The staff is very friendly, overly accommodating, and gave me samples of a few things.   The menu has about 14-16 items on it which is good. 6 are sandwiches, 5 are salads, two are n build your own salad or sandwich, one is soup, and the rest are. small side things like bread, chips, and soda. This eliminates the confusion of too much on the menu.   I recommend this place for a nice, quiet lunch."}
{"text":"I was picking up some school uniforms at a nearby store and on a whim decided to stop in and grab some lunch with my son.  We walked in around 1 on a Friday and were greeted warmly by a lovely lady at the front counter. She made us feel welcome and right at home.  I was feeling slightly adventurous and since I'm not that familiar with french food, I asked her to recommend something for us. She suggested the 1/2 sandwich and salad special. I got the Greek salad and turkey sandwich. She recommended the ham and cheese croissant for my son.  We sat down and enjoyed the view out the window while we waited.  Within about 5 minutes they brought the food to our table.  It looked amazing!  Everything tasted just as good as it looked. My son ate every bite of his sandwich and the little salad that came with it. My Greek salad was delicious and fresh as well.  We picked out some of their fresh pastries on the way out to bring home.  Those were all wonderful as well. If we find ourselves in the area again, I'll definitely make a point to stop back in for the great food and warm service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in earlier this morning and got an almond croissant which was great. He's not really a pastry person so I was surprised at how much he loved it. There ended up being some chocolate in the middle which he liked even more. So much that we had to go back a couple hours later and get three of them. They didn't end up having the chocolate in the middle like the first one we had though. I didn't mind but my boyfriend was a bit disappointed. We noticed the pastries of the day and decided to get one of those as well. There was an apricot pistachio and a fig one. I let my boyfriend decide and he chose apricot pistachio even though I wanted the fig one haha. The cashier, who I think might also be an owner, must have overheard me because she ended up giving me the fig pastry to try for free! I haven't tried the pistachio yet but the fig was amazing. Safe to say we'll be back not only for the pastries but the great customer service(they're extremely sweet and welcoming when you enter the store so we're not only coming back because they gave us a free pastry). We've already decided to have the French breakfast and the Italian sandwich on our next visit."}
{"text":"Nanny's French Breakfast Sandwich Restaurant is Delicious!  When I first tried this place - the first thing that stood out to me, was how clean everything was. U can tell by the Glassware they use and the table settings. The owner and everyone that works here are so polite and friendly.  I definitely recommend Nanny's to my friends and anyone looking for a great Panini and cup of coffee.  I've tried 3 sandwiches so far- and All are good tasting.  I recommend the Chicken Pesto Panini- and the Italian Panini- and even the Ham Croissant. The Paninis are a really good size and actually pretty filling with just half of one! They serve it with a nice light salad on the side with dressing and tomatoes. I also order a Cappuccino - I love their coffee  Check out Nanny's for a nice lunch and good price!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  The beignets are the best I've had.  The service is amazing too.  Definitely recommend Nanny's!"}
{"text":"Excellent French pastries. Small but oh so delicious. Excellent service with authentic French (or Belgian) accents. Great place to enjoy a cup of coffee after a long bike ride. They also serve a  variety of breakfast omelets and brunch sandwiches. At first blush, products may seem pricey, but at first taste, price seems well worth it. Centrally located for Summerlin near Rampart and Lake Mead."}
{"text":"Hungry for breakfast and Nanny's was nearby. Never been and super glad we came in. Had the salami and cheese sandwich and Italian and both had great flavor combinations. I'll definitely keep this place in mind for catering when I need good sandwiches. Thank you for the great service!"}
{"text":"A very confused concept with a misleading name. The extent of their French Breakfast Sandwiches is ham and cheese on four different types of bread. The ham is painfully sparse and the cheese is processed cheddar. Drip coffee is $2.25 per cup with no refills, a dagger in my book. Service was friendly but very unenthusiastic and slow."}
{"text":"The bread for the sandwiches is so crunchy on the outside and soft inside. The ingredients are super fresh. Nothing is overwhelmed with sauce or condiments. All tastes light and delicious but filling. Prices are reasonable for the large portions. Excellent lunch spot!  Friendly service. Warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Between appointments, I needed to pass some time and I opted to have breakfast at Nanny's which has been a bookmark for a couple of months.  In a strip mall near the corner of Rampart and Lake Mead, there is ample parking but all the spots in front were marked 20 minute parking so I didn't park there.  There is a small menu for breakfast--a couple of omelettes and some breakfast paninis.  I chose the ham and cheese omelette and a black coffee.  I then took my seat and the very nice woman who took my order soon brought the coffee.  It was rich and strong with a good flavor.  Then the omelette came.  The egg was very fluffy and it was served with four thick slices of very tasty baguette.  The ham was thin lunch meat and there was a good amount to go with the cheese.  I would like to have more of a choice at breakfast but given the small size of the place, I guess I can't expect a large menu.  I enjoyed my breakfast."}
{"text":"I absolutely ADORE this place. I come here a few times a week and get their vanilla roiboos tea and some of their pastries. Their madeleines are to DIE for. So delicious with a cup of coffee or their organic tea! Their sandwiches are fantastic, as is their chicken salad. And the best part about every experience is the SERVICE. The women who work in the morning from around 9-noon are absolutely fantastic, always sweet and kind. I haven't eaten there in the afternoon, so I am not familiar with who works at that time, but I am betting that they're great as well. One of my favorite places ever. Thank you Nanny's for your fantastic service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"The apricot pastry is out of this world. So authentically French and Nanny is a doll."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Get the vegetarian panini and add chicken! Great prices and great food"}
{"text":"Really great food.    The food - I had an Italian sandwich and didmt really read the ingredients closely when ordering - I figured I knew what an Italian sandwich was.  I was wrong. However, it was awesome.  There was only a thin sliced piece if Italian ham, a piece of provolone, some olive spread and a dries tomato.  I'm thinking this thing was missing at least two other meats...  However the blend of these high quality ingredients along with the delightful bread was more than satisfying.    The people -. Very nice people who operate the business.  You feel like you're on vacation and you hear their French accent.    The place -. Very clean but the most uncomfortable chairs for bigger folks inside - I felt like I was at the kiddie table.  I will never, ever eat inside again. My butt hurts and may back hurt.  Never again.    If I'm eating here again, it will be to go"}
{"text":"I came in because of the ratings but I was sorely disappointed. The young lady at the front was probably the only positive observation. They hired the right person but this place is very overhyped. The mozzarella tomato was very soggy and sour. The spicy sandwich was in extremely hard bread and the floors of this pace were filthy to the point of being sticky! Too bad that the ratings are so misleading."}
{"text":"Wonderful bistro type atmosphere.  I'm definitely coming back when I get into Las Vegas again.  Thank you Nanny's for a great send off."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. The Croissant was flaky and warm and they took a long time to make the sandwich and honestly, I would have waited longer! wonderful Mademoiselle!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This little place is so tucked away I'm not sure a lot of people know about it which is a shame. It's owned by a husband and wife / Belgian French couple. I'm French Canadian so we were able to chit chat in French. The wife/owner is very friendly and they make everything to order. We've been here several times and it's always been very fresh. Their soups are homemade, and their croissant omelette breakfast is to die for. They also offer free Wi-Fi.  My favorite dishes are the cucumber plate, the croissant omelet, the Italian sandwich, and all of their sweets. Their pastries are delicious as well! Oh and I can't forget to mention the bread. They make their bread there and I've offered to buy it however they don't sell it unfortunately. This is definitely one of our favorite brunch/lunch places."}
{"text":"Cute family owned place. Great pastries. Perfect omelets - nice and fluffy. And the BEST coffee!! Loved my cappuccino so much I had one there and one to go!"}
{"text":"This is one of the newest cafes in the Summerlin Area. Their menu includes sandwiches, paninis, pasta, salads and some pastries. I ordered the Belgium sandwich which comes in a foot long french bread and a side salad. The bread was very fresh and tasty. The rest of the sandwich was just ok. There was really nothing really special about it. I feel that for $10 dollars I personally would rather go to firehouse. I saw that a lot of their menu items contain boiled eggs. They were good, but I just found it out of the ordinary. I tried two of the pastries, unfortunately they were both a little disappointing. The service was very good, the owners are really trying hard to provide genuine and personalized service. Overall, just an average cafe."}
{"text":"I love this place it's a great little spot for a quick lunch The first time I ate here I ordered to go and the service was quick and the paninis are amazing the bread is so good perfectly crunchy and soft and great flavor! I had the Belgian witch has Gouda and Ham...the next time I went I dined in I had the Italian Panini it was also delicious but my friends got the tomato and mozzarella panini and sandwich and both options looked delicious! When you dine in you get a side salad that a decent portion. When I ordered to go tho the salad portion was pretty ridiculous that would be my only complaint. Also tried one of the chocolate twisted pastries and it was delish! Overall I'd come back for the paninis!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, fast and friendly service. Definitely will come back again. Nice and quiet atmosphere"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early breakfast this Saturday morning with my family and had an excellent experience! Yummy fresh food paired with speedy and pleasant service. We especially enjoyed the fresh croissants and pastries. We will be going back to enjoy another meal at this quaint place."}
{"text":"Wow is this place fantastic. The panini was on the delicious bread, and the tomato and mozzarella salad was maybe the best I've ever had. Can't wait to go back and try some of their other offerings!"}
{"text":"Oh I'm so glad to have trusted the Yelpers ratings on this one.  Quaint Belgian cafe with warm staff and smiles.  Free wifi, light food, and very good value.  ($2 cup of coffee, delicious, no refills but who cares).  Ham & Cheese omelette croissant sandwich had fluffy eggs, not salty, and served warm with melting cheese and a few bites of salad.  Husband modified his as vegetarian and the staff happily complied.  We were even gifted a huge Madeleine cookie as a treat!  Perfect brunch meal on the weekend."}
{"text":"Very clean and very cute. The woman I spoke with was exceedingly polite and friendly. I had a cup of coffee that and a Belgien Panini. Both of them were excellent and I was especially impressed with the coffee, it tasted very high quality. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh bread, fresh pastries and sandwiches are made to order in front of you. No pre-prepared or prepackaged assembly line here. Average $8-$10 but it's actually fresh, good-tasting food. You get what you pay for. Friendly and delicious. This is my second visit and definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great for breakfast/brunch! This is a very \"mom & pop\" French cafe that offers a simple breakfast menu (ham and cheese omelettes/croissants/pastries) and a variety of sandwiches that are priced around $5-$10. The area is quite small, but the food is done well and is served to you fast, so it is a great place to go to after a morning workout with a few friends."}
{"text":"Super nice staff! Very casual. My veggie panini was very fresh and hot. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast in this famyli restaurant, fresh coffee and friendly service. I will definitely come back. I think it willbe and awesome place for girlfriend's meet up :)"}
{"text":"The best chocolate croissant we've ever had!  The staff was so kind and easy going. I felt that we were on a mini-vacation as the restaurant promoted a true French cafe experience - encouraging us to relax and enjoy the food and company. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm so rarely on this side of town. It's like another world to me. So when my husband and I were in the area I jumped at the chance to try a new place. I checked my Yelp app and saw that Nanny's was right around the corner from where we were.   Nanny's is a French cafe. They have a small menu of sandwiches, paninis, salads, and omelets. Plus, they had some beautiful looking pastries. After perusing the menu Joel ordered the salami sandwich and I had the Belgian panini.   Joel's sandwich came on a huge piece of baguette. It had salami, cheese, and pickles. Plus, it had a side salad with romaine lettuce, tomatoes, eggs, and topped with ranch dressing. He said it was good, but nothing we couldn't make at home. My Belgian panini was so large it took up most of my plate. It was hot, toasty and loaded with ham and gouda cheese all melted together. Very tasty and crunchy!   The staff was so friendly and helpful. I love locally owned business. The panini is definitely worth stopping in for. They have many different versions that all sound delicious. Next time I'm going to try their pretty pastries. If your in the area check out this quaint cafe for brunch or lunch or even a snack!"}
{"text":"Service is very personable. Salads and sandwiches have quality ingredients like gouda yet the prices are reasonable. Italian coffee is dark and smooth."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was so slow. There wasn't enough people working to handle the amount of tables filled (even though they were at maybe half capacity). Definitely not a bad place to eat l although nothing special, but the limited menu, slow service, and how out of the way this restaurant is will prevent us from eating here again."}
{"text":"My son and I went today and it was so delicious. Warm and welcoming by the owners. I had the French breakfast and the croissants were amazing. Best  I have had since I was in Paris. Coffee- delicious! My son had the Spicy sandwich. Fresh ingredients, simple and good sides side salad. This is our new place!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here this morning and really enjoyed it. I split the Belgian panini with my husband and it was really good. It's just Black Forest ham and Gouda, but it was yummy. It came with a little side salad that had some cherry tomatoes, little egg, and ranch. It was very fresh tasting. We got the strawberry pastry, chocolate cream pastry, cinnamon pastry, and mini croissant. They were all delicious. The girls working were very nice and helpful when ordering.  Good came out really fast.  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful bread, perfect amount of topping in the sandwiches. Large portions and super friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"My little lunch spot when I walk my dog. First we go to get coffee, then we come here for the croissant caprese!! My favorite! Clean, neat, not too fancy. Great outdoor seating in fall."}
{"text":"Delicious!   It's a small kinda inconspicuous restaurant off Lake Mead Blvd, but delicious food and very good service. A perfect place to come and catch up with an old friend or just have a delicious, nutricious lunch!!  Great place - I'm for sure going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast sandwich. Coffee was also good and the croissant was flaky and delicious. My friend had the Italian sandwich and couldn't stop raving about it. Highly recommend this place for either breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Very nice local place.  Had the croissants and they were very good.  Had the Italian Panini. It was very good.  Light on the meat by American standards, but very flavorful.  I would have quality with good flavor or quantity any time, and this place seems to focus on that.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this location. So good... I love the Italian Sandwich . Thank you Severine... Vive la Belgique !!"}
{"text":"Snowbirds from Michigan just discovered this great little cafe in our Las Vegas winter neighborhood. Jamie and I split a Greek Salad and Belgian Panini (Black Forest ham and gouda) - terrific combo, also excellent French coffee and chocolate croissants. You know it's authentic French when both employees, probably the owners, are speaking French in the kitchen. We'll be back for sure - need to try their breakfasts."}
{"text":"First time here the food was great I had the chicken spicy panini it wasn't to big or to small they put a small house salad with it, it completed the dish... Definitely going back there."}
{"text":"I've been to Nanny's twice now, and I thoroughly enjoy their paninis.  My kid is 7 and he ordered the Nanny's sandwich, which has a pepper sauce on it and the ladies who worked there were very sweet and after we had sat down brought us a sample of the sauce to ensure that he liked it, without us asking. They even smashed it panini style so he could fit it in his mouth.  We ordered two cafe lattes and they were over priced for what you get, but the sandwiches are worth what you paid. I got the panini with the buffalo sauce on it and it was fantastic! Would absolutely eat here again, this was our second visit."}
{"text":"Best croissant I have ever had! Wonderful French bakery and very low prices. Their French breakfast is a steal at 4.50, and so so good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Affordable, delicious food and polite service. I only wish the seating inside was a bit better. I felt like some of the tables were too close to one another for a private conversation. Other than that, it's pretty much perfect. I paid $40 for two people to eat breakfast/brunch, both have coffee/tea, and even took one of each pastry in the display case home with me. (About 10 different selections total)"}
{"text":"Terrific warm ham and cheese panini!  A very good lunch size and very clean place. We were warmly greeted and has a relaxing meal.  Th spicy chicken pesto was also delicious and will look forward to trying other items next trip."}
{"text":"So TODAY we started / ended our bike ride at Nanny's.  Though I've been there before, my group hadn't, so I wanted to introduce them!   I love the coffee, one of my friends got the ham and cheese omelet, and another the \"Spicy\" sandwich which  they both raved about.  The owner too great care of us and sitting outside was a lovely bonus.  We'll be back again and gain, I'm sure! Thanks for taking such great care of us!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and breakfast.  Awesome sandwiches and paninis, healthy salads, tasty pasties and breakfast sandwiches.  Expresso drinks are good but could use more variety on the drink menu.  Nice atmosphere and friendly service.   I like the Belgium sandwich.  Good vegetarian selections."}
{"text":"This is a cute quite little French breakfast and lunch quick stop. The staff is very sweet and service is good. However, I had noticed that there is no tradition kitchen for cooking meals and my omelet was cooked in a microwave, yikes! It kind of reminds me of a Starbucks only with bad coffee."}
{"text":"Just love these small businesses that are actually ran and managed by their owners. The service was great, the place is super clean , the owner is gracious and nice. And do not forget about the fabulous croissants, the yummy sandwiches and the amazing Italian coffee they have there.  My local friends, the place worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place is small, quiet and the food is wonderful. Everything is very traditional to what you would find in France. The sandwiches, salad and breakfasts are simple plus the coffee is strong. All the breads are baked there on site. The Panini's come with a small salad. There is outdoor seating too. A real hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Beautiful little spot tucked away. Find it and you will be delighted by the fresh food and impeccable service. The bread took me right back to Paris! I will be back."}
{"text":"Was going to Classic Kids to buy my son his pre-school uniforms and they didn't open until 10:00 so took my son and infant daughter in for breakfast. I was excited to find out the owners were from Belgium but sadly they didn't speak Flemish (same as Dutch really) but rather French only-still happy to talk about The Netherlands and Belgium. My son got a bunch of small doughnuts and AMAZING mini muffins-he loved the chocolate Ines which were filled with creamy chocolate. I told them I was on a low carb diet (shedding the baby weight) and they made me a great ham and cheese omelette with a side of salad. I also had a double espresso. Great little place!!!"}
