{"text":"I would like to send my thank you and appreciation to Roy & Kevin for their hospitality, and providing the excellent and prompt service to all customers during my dining experience."}
{"text":"I'll put it short and simple. Everything I tried other then the meat sampler was good. Problem is I came in to have BBQ but it tasted like it was oven cooked with seasoning to fake the taste. Dry, tough, plain tasting meats. Too bad!  Cheap though so that will keep it busy at Sams. Lol."}
{"text":"We spent 62.20 and here's what we got:  Fried Green Tomatoes: Dont Buy! You only get 4 slices for 6.99. The sauce they come with is good but the tomatoes in cormeal are bland.  Pulled Pork Shoulder Sandwich w/ fries w/ pickle no coleslaw: Originally 9.99 but ad said Monday-Thursday 6pm_9pm it's 7.99, still had to pay full price ( we were seated just before 6:30pm). Pulled pork was dry and chewy even with the \"sauce\" that comes on it which is bland. Bun was dry and burnt, pickle was warm, coffee ok. Fries came seasoned w/ salt and pepper, meh.  Fried Chicken & Biscuit: w/mac n cheese, collard greens, 16.49. Four pieces of greasy outside-dry inside chicken. Greens/Mac/Biscuit all flavorless and bland.  Catfish Plate: w/fries, coleslaw, tartar sauce, cornbread hushpuppies, 14.99. Catfish pieces cornmeal breaded and bland, coleslaw too sweet and tasted like mass produced, hushpuppies dry and bland, tartar sauce tasted like Kraft or Helmans out of the bottle.  Cup of coffee 3 dollars, 2 sodas 6 dollars  Seeiously the only nice thing about dinner tonight was the waitress. Though when I told her about the pulled pork she just said Sorry and walked away.  It's obvious they are cutting corners to save money. Though if you are trying to compete with the Angry Butcher which is right next door you need to up your game and get real. The food is very generic, some tastes frozen, some microwaved, and too heavily fried. That is not BBQ or Southern food. Change your ways or see this restaurant close shop because the steakhouse mext door is amazing.   Save your money people and just go to the Angry Butcher."}
{"text":"Good food for a new restaurant. Get the baby back ribs with beans they're tasty. The bead ribs are ok.   I won't be eating here very often I would rather eat at The Angry Butch"}
{"text":"The corn bread was cold.  The Cole slaw was made in a food processor and to soggy and not crunchy.  I've had better brisket.  Price was cheap."}
{"text":"I was staying at the hotel and my husband was really craving barbeque, so luckily enough we found out about Big Mess after checking to see what restaurants were around! We were very happy that it was conveniently right down stairs also!  Our server was Margaret, and was so absolutely kind, warm, and very attentive! I don't think our drinks ever sat in need of a fill up once, and any thing we needed, she was quick and brought it with a smile! Our Bus Boy was also very kind and efficient, but I am unsure of his name! He was a younger, short guy, with glasses, and a very nice smile!  It was New Year's Eve and we had our three kids with us, so ended up ordering kind of a family style meal! We ordered an appetizer to share! We also ordered a few platters to share, along with the Mac N Cheese! All of the food was pretty great! I wouldn't say the best Barbeque I have ever had, but pretty good for Las Vegas BBQ!  The only thing that upset me was that we were charged a $5 Plate Fee for each dinner to share! I just don't understand this, as if you are going to be a Family Style Restaurant, then offering not only a Children's Menu, but actual Family Style Options on the menu would be way better option!  But I will say, the best part of the experience, was when Margaret, our Server, very first greeted us, she brought over New Year's Eve Party Hats and Blower Horns, and said, \"Hey there everyone! Let's get this party started!\" I really enjoyed this because there isn't much to do for the children our kids' age in Vegas, but they had a blast with the party stuff she gave us while we watched the fireworks!"}
{"text":"Just wanted some appetizers and drink before 5 pm bingo. So glad we chose here. I think this just opened. Super clean and menus are brand spankin'.  My husband had the happy hour beer, buy a 12 oz. draft, get one free. Guinness, all good.  I had the the Bloody Mary. Interesting, I think they use a little BBQ sauce. I could have a little less of that but it was good.   We are the New Orleans barbecue shrimp and the fried green tomatoes. Tomatoes were excellent. Crisp and delicious, served with a red tomato sauce. The shrimp was also good, with a darker sauce than I've seen before, but tasty.   I was wishing they served the shrimp with some bread to soak up the sauce. Jay went and got us some cornbread. So nice! Thank you!   Please tell management to serve the shrimp with some baguette slices to make it perfect.  Also, come with friends and the outside tables have built-in ice coolers for a bunch of beers. Love it!  Overall, great place with good food and great staff."}
{"text":"With family in town we wanted to enjoy several things at one place so Sams Town was a great option.  We wanted to try the Big Mess BBQ for dinner but what a mistake.  We read the reviews and they all seemed great but let me share our experience.  We got drinks ordered and the sweet tea did not take like it had any sugar and it was watered down.  The manager brought a couple of other drinks as a replacement.  We waited and waited for a waitress that never came so we asked.  No apologies for the wait.  The waitress finally came out said she was delivering food but it was very slow.  When we got our food the cornbread was cold and fat was throughout the beef brisket.  The chicken was good but it needed more BBQ sauce.  The ribs and wings were ok.  This place needs better customer service and the food could have been better."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at this new restaurant. Love the concept of old school down home southern cooking.  First, the good. Loved the opportunity to try three different of their signature drinks!  The baby back ribs were great and the brisket was good too.  We all loved the mash potatoes and gravy.  Unfortunately, they did have areas that needed improvement.  The mac and cheese, cole slaw, and green beans were all lacking in flavor.  The corn bread needed a little something extra to give it some flavor.  I recommend adding some jalepeno flavoring and serving in mini iron skillets.  Hush puppies needed bits of real corn kernels added.  The service was good and we really appreciated the extra attention from the manager.  He checked in frequently and was open to our ideas on how to improve.  I think this is a good restaurant that has the opportunity to become a great restaurant."}
{"text":"It was ok. There were 3 of us, we each ordered something different, wanted to get a good sampling. The beef ribs were very good, the brisket was good but the pulled pork was very fatty. Only 2 types of sauce, neither particularly good, cheap bottle stuff. BBQ beans were definitely canned with added spice. Hush puppies weren't fully cooked, they were liquid batter on the inside.  The ice chest in middle of table should have a cover so that part of the table can be used if you're not beer drinkers. I don't care if I go back to Big Mess, Famous Daves is better. My husband and son said they would give it another try."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The staff was wonderful. Treated my kids great! I'd definitely make this a must visit next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had to go back and try one of Steve's delicious homemade lemon drop martinis also try the barbecue shrimp appetizer oh my God I hope this doesn't turn into an everyday thing good food good drinks beautiful atrium"}
{"text":"Big Mess was amazing over at Sam's Town Casino! Reina was our waitress and she was such a sweetheart! I recommend the peach cobbler. You wouldn't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I have no complaints about the service, and they were quite attentive. The food is what I can't highly rate. While some things were good, others were not. I loved their sides, such as their delicious mash potatoes & gravy and greens. Their gumbo soup was also very good. The mac & cheese was bad and tasted as if it came out of a box. The meats were troubling, especially the brisket , which was just too dry. It seems hard to get brisket that is juicy and crispy around the edges. The ribs and the pulled pork were OK. However, when I ordered food to go one time, the sauce they put on the pulled pork was disgusting and had a very sour taste, which ruined it."}
{"text":"So I was browsing Yelp for a good BBQ spot and I found this with great reviews. I don't know where those reviews came from. I had a horrible experience here. It started with walking Into the restaurant, the vibes where good people laughing and having a good time. We had no wait to sit down and it took about 15 to get our waiter keep in mind the restaurant is not that busy. Here's where I should have got up and left but I decided to stay the waiter kept hurry us up to get a drink and to order . I got brisket, chicken, Mac n cheese , potato salad and a buttermilk biscuit with sweet potatoes.  Point blank I only will recommend potatoes salad and sweet potatoes fries. Everything else was so dry that even if I submerged it in BBQ sauce it didn't help. Service is bad and so is the food. I should have drove somewhere else"}
{"text":"Great service by Blanca...good BBQ for Nevada...We are from Texas and this BBQ was great."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, and we were so glad we did.  Good food, great prices... Side order of Gumbo is only $3 and it is delish!!!"}
{"text":"Very good barbeque. Good portions and reasonable prices.  My date and both ordered the \"All you can Eat\" lunch special.  All-we-could-eat turned out to be less than the first plate that they brought out. Each of the four meats (brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and chicken) were delicious.   If I had to choose only one, I'd go back for the ribs.  We only had a few sides; coleslaw, baked beans, corn on the cob, and cornbread. They were each quite tasty!  I'll order extra coleslaw next time!  The Sam's Town location is either a plus or a detriment depending on your point of view. Personally, I think it's kind of nice. The silly \"Mystic Falls\" water show is like a low-rent Bellagio Fountains. But in a town that built its reputation on kitsch, it fits right in.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always great BBQ and the service rocks. The waitstaff who clean tables and get drinks is amazing. They remembered our drink order after 2 months. We will come back again and again."}
{"text":"We ate at the Big Mess at Sam's Town on Wed. Nite. I had the baby back rib platter and my husband had the pulled pork sandwich. The food was very good and Margaret, our server, was very efficient and attentive. One thing annoyed me. In the past a tasty , hot, corn muffin came with the platters. I was looking forward to this but it was no longer available with the meal. If I wanted it I had to make a special side order for $3.95. Instead two slices of cold supermarket white bread were plopped on top of my ribs! A small thing but a cheap move that annoyed me."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and nobody recommended  this restaurant , but we were in the mood for BBQ. We're  staying at Sam's Town so, we thought what the heck we would give The Big Mess a try. Coming from LA, where there are many great restaurants, we don't always expect much when we travel.   The Big Mess was a super great find. Go ahead and  call us lucky, we won't mind because in this town that's a word you want people to call you.   Saturday night we walked in and there was no wait. We were kindly greeted then the host asked where we would like to sit and we were able to  get a booth table.   Right away our waitress Blanca began to make us feel welcome and got our drink order started. She answered our questions and recommended a few things and the experience was efficient.  Shortly after we placed our order the food was delivered, it came hot and presented beautifully, the aroma was amazing and we couldn't wait to start our meal.   There were four of us in our group, we had several different selections, the pulled pork was perfect, baby back ribs excellent, spare ribs tasteeee, catfish yummy, tri-tip tender and delicious, all the sides ohhhhh! the sides we loved them all.   We skipped dessert, we were too full. But topped the meal off with a specialty Mexican coffee drink that was bravo.  Blanca brought our bill, she kindly asked us if everyone was satisfied , we shared some very friendly chitchat about our meal and our stay in Las  Vegas all went well for us. Blanca was the perfect waitress, friendly, helpful, attentive, and she stopped by our table to check on us just the right amount of times.   The restaurant has a modern country vibe,  the atmosphere is inviting, service was excellent, food smelled good, looked great, and tasted amazing. We even got a chance to meet the manager as we walked out.   If they had a six stars for rating we would give an extra one. Because this restaurant deserves one.  Try The Big Mess, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is the worst!! Ever. Warning!!!  Stay away if you dare to have bad food. Only think good about this place is the waitress good service."}
{"text":"Wifey and I had date night at The Big Mess BBQ Reservation for 2 6pm November 16. Kevin and Jay was beyond helpful stopping by and making sure everything was ok. Jay the Manager stopped by also at our table to make sure everything was fine!    Blanca was our Waitress we really enjoyed having her served us, such a  genuine person!  We ordered Sangria Blanca and the Catfish tasted like it had just been caught from the river. The BBQ Ribs was smoked to perfection tender morsel!  The pork rinds we're great too, everything from the Staff to the food coming out in a  fashionable manner! I'm originally North Carolina BBQ I know! I would have enjoyed Bluegrass music while I ate there but I guess Country would do!  Thank you Blanca and the whole staff for making our date night most enjoyable!  We will have to dine here again soon! I recommend y'all to go get ya some good eating at  Big Mess BBQ!  The Lipscomb"}
{"text":"Ordered the rib platter, brisket! Awesome smoked  taste. Really good sauce! Service was great! Nice bar inside. If you like BBQ highly suggest!"}
{"text":"Lovvvvvveeeeee the food and the atmosphere.  Service could have been better, but the staff is very friendly!  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was very good. I was refered by a coworker and I am glad we decided to stop in.   I had the Brisket plate and it was delicious! Very tender and well flavored. It was not cut lean so it did have quite a bit of fat, but there was more meat on my plate than fat.   Margaret was a great server.  nice, attentive and personable.   I will certainly come back again."}
{"text":"I can't seem to stay away from the Big Mess!  Another impromptu dinner with friends and another evening of delicious BBQ!  We started with the nacho plate.  A giant plate of goodness, nachos, shredded beef, cheese, sour cream, avocado.  We ordered a dinner plate of the fried catfish for the table as well.  A good idea for easy passing with a group. For dinner, Ribs,  beef brisket, salmon and New Orleans shrimp which were all delicious. Dinner ended with the fruit cobbler and coconut cream pie!  The service is always friendly and attentive at Big Mess! Kudos to Sam's Town!"}
{"text":"The worst BBQ meal I have had in Las Vegas.   I ordered the 3 meat platter, and my wife ordered the 2 meat platter.  Both came with 2 sides and corn bread.  The tater tot side consisted of 7 tater tots,  the cornbread was cold and dry, and we were unable to pick it up without it crumbling.  The butter for the cornbread was floating in honey, and when my wife asked for regular butter, she was given a lump of frozen butter which destroyed the crumbling cornbread.   The chicken was undercooked and under seasoned, the sausage was cold.  The ribs were dry and hard.  Both the brisket and BURNT pulled pork came un seasoned and cold.  They have both house and spicy BBQ sauce on the tables, and they both tasted exactly the same.    The host came by towards the end of our meal, nad asked how it was, I told him it was a bad meal...je said OK, and walked away.  Shortly after this, the waitress came by and just dropped the bill on the table and walked away.  She did the same when bringing it back for a signature for the card.     We ordered the pork rinds as an appetizer.   It looked as if they bought a small bag at the store, opened it and dumped some dry rub on it and charged us $6.00 for it.    Un appealing meal.  I doubt we will return....EVER."}
{"text":"Wow!! That's all I can say the food amazing!!  The service fantastic  Blanca rocks!! Will be back again and again and again. Thank you Big mess bbq!!   P.S. try the blackened salmon!! And of course you can never go wrong with the full rack of bbq ribs!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food! The hospitality, the food, and the music just made me like this place even more. The fried chicken was very good, but would recommend not getting it if you're expecting a burst full of flavor...it's like a natural homemade fried chicken. Other than that the ribs, mac, biscuits, tea flavors, & cobbler were AMAZING. On top of that, this place is super affordable!"}
{"text":"I decided to take my boyfriend out for BBQ,  and let's just this place was an extreme let down. First, the hostess didn't ask if  I wanted ( my boyfriend was parking the car) a booth, or a table, and got testy when I asked for a booth, and described my boyfriend to her, so he could be sent to where I was sitting,then the food was blah, not real BBQ at all, the collards were dry with big stems in them, when you're suppose to tear them from the stem, and not include the stem in cooking them,  the buttermilk biscuits were sweet like the cornbread, when every Southern knows that you don't put sugar in cornbread,  or biscuits, the  fried green tomatoes were beyond overcoated in cornmeal, with the sauce being an overkill,   and the meat on both our plates ( different kinds of meat mind you) was dry as can be, and the BBQ sauce was just awful, nothing had any flavor, the deviled eggs were dull, nothing appealing about them. Our server only checked on us a couple times, and the place wasn't even crowded,  so not getting checked on regularly there's no excuse. This experience was definitely not worth almost sixty dollars,  my boyfriend being a nice guy did leave a good tip, but if it were me, I wouldn't of been that generous, when usually I tip twenty to fifty percent. This will be a do over, only if we got money and time to waste, we'll be going next door to The Angry Butcher, where the food and service is great, and worth the money."}
{"text":"The food here was really good, The chef came out and talk to all the guest. I ask what don't they have an all rib plate and he create one for my husband and I, so thank you. But the potato salad was not that good the potatoes were to hard."}
{"text":"Good BBQ and excellent service from our server Iris.  Ribs were tasty and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"EDIT: Big Mess BBQ reached out almost immediately and explained the situation, and made it right! Now I'm back to dreaming about beef brisket, and will be back here once again (after 4pm, as the hours shall remain more dinneresque despite past misleading signage)  Looking forward to a photo filled, appetite inducing post of the food in the future!  Thank you Michelle for the kind message.  ----former complaint below----  This place is now blacklisted for making us show up twice for no reason; once yesterday at 2pm (they don't open til 4pm per the sign out front) then again today when we showed up at 11:30am which that same sign (and many along the highway, as well as yelp) said would yield us BBQ.   Well, we came back and waited at 11:30, pre-roadtrip, and eventually had to call them to discover they don't open until 4pm ever."}
{"text":"Brisket fries were the hit of dinner. We got the 2 meet platter with sausage and pulled pork with 3 sides of his puppies, mac n cheese and Cole slaw. The Cole slaw tasted old. The mac n cheese was dry and tasted like velvita.  The hush puppies were good, nothing spectacular. The corn bread did not resemble corn bread at all. The sweet tea was delish. Service was mediocre. Food came out super fast but was not fresh. Sad because we love staying at sams town. The prices are typical las vegas prices."}
{"text":"It was just okay.  I expected better.  Portions seemed small.  Service was slow.  Memphis Barbeque is better by far.  I doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"Very trendy.The food was good we ordered the 5 meat plate to share that came with 2 sides.There was enough leftover to feed another person.The best of the 5 meats was the barbecued kielbasa.my second choice was the ribs the rest chicken, brisket slices and pulled pork. Did not care for the pulled pork because it had a mustard sauce on top and I dislike mustard. We did not have dessert.Since this restaurant is in a casino resort. I only ate there once. Overall I would give this 3 stars because I was not crazy about thebarbecue sauce."}
{"text":"The food was a solid three stars, but four stars because of the wonderful service we received from Iris as well as Jay. Thank you both!  My family and I enjoyed dinner together to celebrate a birthday. To start, we ordered the BBQ Beef Nachos for the table. The nachos were pretty tasty and the portion was extremely huge for just $8.49! Two people alone would not be able to finish this... I think.  I wasn't in the mood for BBQ (don't hate) and I ordered the Southern Fried Catfish plate. The catfish was fresh and hot, I could see the steam rising after I took my first bite. I liked it, but the cornmeal batter didn't have much flavor. It could've used more seasoning, so as you could imagine, the house-made tartar sauce was a must! It also came with an obscene amount of hushpuppies which were okay, I'm not really a fan.  The slaw deserves its own section in my review. It was not good. Their take on cole slaw is something else. There's absolutely no texture to it and it was basically minced. It didn't have that classic cole slaw crunch, you know? I didn't like it at all.   Whatever you do, do yourself a favor and order some of the sweet cornbread. Those babies were about the size of a teacup saucer and I didn't regret one bite."}
{"text":"We started with the BBQ Shrimp appetizer.  They were good.  Not Emeril's level but good.  I could have done without the shells.  Peach tea, sweet tea and a Bigellini were our drinks.  The peach tea was amazing, sweet tea good and Bigellini not so much.  The Bigellini is their version of a bellini.  Normally I wouldn't order one but I just had the best one ever at The Grotto and after tasting their peach tea (thinking they might use the same mix) I couldn't resist.   I should have.  It didn't have any peach flavor at all and I am not a champagne/sparkling wine person.  So it wasn't the drink for me.  I wish i would have asked for a vodka and peach tea.    For our main we shared the 4 meat combo.  There is a $5 split plate fee.  For our meats we chose briskets, sausage, pulled pork and spare ribs.  Mac and cheese and coleslaw were our combo sides.  We also added a side of mashed potatoes and gravy and sweet potato fries.  Our food came out fairly quickly.  The meats were moist.  Not dry or tough like other reviews mentioned.  There wasn't much bbq or smoke flavor and I would have preferred the sausage to be hot links.  They have 2 house bbq sauces, regular and spicy.  I liked the flavor of the spicy better.  I would have loved it if it was actually spicy.  There was no hint of heat in it.  Sides were average.  We never got our coleslaw.  For dessert we ordered a slice of coconut creme cake to take home.  Again average.  Service was great.  No problems there.  I thought prices were on the low end.  Our total was $70 before tip.  Overall, I've had better but extra star for service.  So many great BBQ spots opening up not to far away I'll have a hard time coming back.  They have beer on ice in the middle of the table.  You just grab one and they charge you for what you take.  Kinda like a minibar.  I don't drink beer but thought that was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Food was good, but service sucked. they got me all excited about a 5 sample draft, & draft was down. the BBQ sauce was mediocre at best, the spicy was just vinaigre with no heat, the regular was too smoky. The service helper was the only one who paid us any mind, no tea refills. we left $5 on an almost  $60 bill, and felt like leaving nothing. the ribs were good, the slaw was good, the cornbread was very dry and mostly flour with little corn meal. they know how to cook meat.. now if they just knew how to do customer service."}
{"text":"So the family and I  decided to give Big Mess BBQ a try.  Decorative was simple, not very southern.  No aroma to the dining room. When you go into a BBQ joint, you want to be able to smell what's in the smoker.  You want that smoky vibe. You don't  get that here.  Service was mediocre at best.  Ask Kevin about the pepper sauce.  Fresh brewed sweet tea was actually Brisk Iced tea.  We ordered a few appetizers, they were good enough.  So then the main entrée's arrived. The ribs were bland, cold, and not very tender. The brisket was fatty but had more flavor than the ribs.  The pork shoulder was bland and fatty as well. Then there were the sides. Bland, bland, oh yes bland.  The sauces were then and mediocre.  I know they have only been open for a few weeks, but come on."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times, and never disappointed. The Chef always caters to my gluten allergy. The fried catfish is delicious. Husband had the ribs again, very good. The staff is the best, and Steve always gives us the best service at the bar. If you haven't tried it, you should!"}
{"text":"I have been so happy to see the renovations that Boyd has done at their restaurants. We have really enjoyed the Redwood Grill (the Cal) and the Angry Butcher (Sam's Town) but Big Mess is a major disappointment.   We ordered the January special, a Low Country Boil and a Three Meat Plate. On both plates the food was cold and unappetizing without much flavor at all. Considering we showed up right at opening I was really surprised to get cold BBQ and cold potato wedges that were just barely done. The BBQ ribs and brisket were cold and not too tender. Something is wrong with a place if the food is cold right at the start of service.  There were two bright spots. The $10 32 oz beer was huge and Four Peaks Kilt Lifter is a great brew. The second was the excellent service we received from our server Margaret and the manager on duty Ryan. Margaret did a great job serving us and she let Ryan know our about our complaints. I like when a manager comes over and listens to my concerns about the quality of the food. Ryan did a great job in taking care of part of our meal and I believed him when he said he'd pass on our complaints about the quality of the food.  I really do want to like this place since it's local for us and it's a great location in a nice environment in the Mystic Park Falls. But for me to want to give it another chance I need to know that they have worked on improving the food."}
{"text":"Our group enjoyed their meals.  Good service, big portions, reasonable prices.  We asked to substitute side dishes (menu for some items had baked beans & cole slaw, but they said \"no problem\" to change)."}
{"text":"This is the second time my husband and I have eaten here. Service was great! Roy was our server. He was exceptional. Food was absolutely delicious. Best BBQ ribs ever!"}
{"text":"Omg why isn't this a known spot!? Everything is melt in your mouth ahhh-mazing and the staff is just as great!  I ordered the fried catfish and it is the best I've never had, no joke. Mom ordered the salmon and she says it even compares to fish houses in California!   Didn't get to eat BBQ this time but I did try some of there house bbq sauce and I really really enjoyed it.   Order the shrimp appetizers with there sauce. I need to know the recipe!!!! Maybe I can get it    10/10 by far"}
{"text":"You could not imagine how bad the ALL YOU CAN'T EAT BBQ is!! The ribs and sliced brisket were definitely from yesterday!! Dry as sawdust and overdone due to being reheated. When I told the waitress she said\" What do you want me to do\"? Not a bit of denial of it being reheated from last night's unused meats.I asked for the manager and she said I will let the \"cooks\" know about this!!  Seriously.... the biggest ripoff you'll ever see!! Try a McRib sandwich at McDonalds and you won't know the difference.This place will not be in business much longer."}
{"text":"Great service by Reina ! She made the difference as we are not big BBQ fans. Shrimp appetizer and nachos good. Enjoyed the mini samplers for drinks and beer."}
{"text":"This place definitely has potential. Brand new to Sam's Town, Big Mess BBQ is located right near the focal point of Mystic Falls Park, the big waterfall. The atmosphere, food and affordability are all on point. Unfortunately, the service has been kind of mediocre. I'm sure at this point, they are just going through growing pains because they are brand-new.  We enjoyed dinner for two with two cocktails and an appetizer for less than $45. For the appetizer, we opted for \"pickles and chips\". Fried pickles and homemade potato chips. Both the pickles and potato chips were outstanding. I opted for the BBQ Ranch Burger. It was scrumptious with cheese, bacon and onion. The coleslaw was only so-so, but the fries were great. The Mrs. went with the chicken sandwich, which could help satisfy any appetite.   They offer desserts and a full compliment of beers and specialty drinks. We'll plan better next time and save room for some of the peach cobbler. Once they work out the kinks and get over the growing pains, I'm sure this will be a four or five star dining experience."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM! Located inside Sam's Town LV this place is delicious! Service is helpful and courteous. They have an appetizer I've never seen freshly made (pork rinds) they add awesome! Must try! Gumbo soup was great! All the bbq food was great cooked perfectly and great flavor. Dish for the win was Blackened Salmon!! So flavorful and delicious! Give this place a try they were awesome!"}
{"text":"This was the first time my son and I tried this place out. We love barbecue and like Famous Daves so we figured we would try this place out since its been open a few months. The things I liked: 1. The servings were huge (see pics) 2. Service was relatively quick it was a Saturday afternoon they opened at 4:00 pm 3. Hush puppies were some of the best seasoned I have ever tasted, definitely recommend those and the french fries. 4. Pricing was average our meal came to $65.00 and we had a good portion of food. 5. Shrimp appetizers and brisket quesadillas were very good recommend those as well.  The rest of the food was not seasoned to my liking, for instance like the sweet water corn bread, it was not sweet at all. But if you like barbecue definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking forward to eating here. We went on our 31st anniversary. The wait staff was very good. Our waiter promptly greeted us and took our drink orders. He offered suggestions on food items. During the meal he checked back regularly with us to make sure we had what we needed. The biggest disappointment was the food itself. We both ordered two meat platters. My wife had ribs and chicken and I had ribs and brisket. My wife's meal arrived cold which was odd since it arrived less than 5 minutes from the time our order was taken. The ribs, though they had a smoke flavor, had very little meat and it was tough, not tender. Her chicken was overly dry and lacked flavor. The side of fries were cold. On my platter the ribs were the same. 1/3 of the brisket on my plate was fat. I love brisket, but this was by no means what I expected. The side of baked beans for the platter comes in a very small cup. Each platter also come with cornbread that was lacking in flavor. Since I don't go out to eat just for the service I would have to say, based on the food we received, that we won't be going back to the Big Mess BBQ unless I was told they have made positive changes."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived near here for almost a year and hadn't tried it.  First off, Roy is the best server ever. He was so attentive and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience.   I ordered the Sweet Tea, and at one point he asked if I would also liked to try the Peach Tea. He was also very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the BBQ Brisket sandwiches, and he recommended we get them with sauce on the side so that we could control how much sauce we put on them. Little details like that were much appreciated!  The sandwiches were reasonably priced (about $10) and the brisket was incredibly tender. You get a lot of it, too. We actually had to take some of it out of the sandwiches and eat it; the sandwiches were too big to fit into our mouths otherwise.  I will definitely be back in the future and can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a Saturday evening and it was not busy. We arrived at the same time as an elderly man with a walker. He was sat by the hostess, but it took her 2 minutes to return to seat us as she sat him near the back of the restaurant. Did he request the furthest away seat from the entrance or did she do it intentionally? Who knows.  We were sat right by the entrance and the only other occupied tables nearby were a group of 6-8 and a couple. The couple was chit-chatting with a waitress, and the group of 6-8 was being helped by someone else. Nobody came by for drinks in the first three minutes we were seated as we continually tried to make eye contact with servers in the area.  Our table turned out to be served by the waitress chatting with the nearby couple. Her name was Iris. She saw us being seated, she saw us sitting there, but she kept on chatting. It would only get worse from here. When Iris did come over she asked if we were ready. We haven't even ordered drinks yet and she's pushing us to order food! My wife ordered a margarita and I asked for water.  I also asked Iris about some items on the menu. First, there's one I believe is called \"The Big Mess\" which is 5 lbs of meats (5 different types), 2 sides, and dessert. The reason I asked about that is because they also have a regular 4-meat plate that costs $23.99 and only comes with 6 ounces of each meat, two sides, and no desert. It seemed like a no-brainer to go for the $39.99 one, eat some there, and take some home. She informed me that it's not possible to do that -- they make you sign a waiver and then sit there and watch you eat it. I guess you have 30 minutes to eat it and then if there are leftovers you can take them home. I get the challenge aspect of it, but if you just want to order it, pay the money, and not have someone watch you for 30 minutes why can't you do that? It's pretty asinine.  In both cases, information was missing from the menu, both online and in person. The online menu listing does not have the 2, 3, or 4-meat plates or the 39.99 \"challenge\". There is a separate online page (not on the regular menu) that does describe the challenge. The menu in the restaurant has these items but it doesn't describe the challenge, nor does it have any information about it being prohibited to order it if you don't actually want to do the challenge. The menu in the restaurant also doesn't state that the 2, 3, and 4-meat plates come with sides, just like the challenge does!  Another confusing thing is that the menu lists has a comma-separated list of about a dozen sides, all of which cost $3.99. Right below that there is also a separate listing for a side of cornbread which is ... $3.99. Why not list it with the other sides? Lastly, the online menu lists specialty drinks and in fact there is an entire drink menu. We were not presented with this at the restaurant.  Menu idiocy aside, let's get back to the main story. Iris goes to get drinks and to give us some time to decide. While she is gone another server (didn't get his name, but he was a big black guy) asks if we need drinks. We're not even one of his tables, so that was nice. Iris comes back and brings my wife her drink, but did not bring my water. She asks if we are ready to order, so I start out by asking for a water and she says she forgot to bring my water. Iris, did it not seem strange to you that you were bringing only one drink to a table with two people? In any case, we also order the 4 meat (brisket, sausage, chicken, pulled pork) plate.  I can't even believe the next sequence of events. She goes to the back to put our order in. She comes back out, starts chatting with the aforementioned couple again, leaves, brings the couple two drinks, and then when she comes by our table she again points out that she forgot the water.   I take the opportunity to ask her about the barbecue sauce on the table. I wanted to know if it had mustard in it. She stares at me for 5 seconds as if I'm some weirdo or alien for asking that, then says she has no idea. She leaves and then, shortly thereafter, the food shows up. BTW, eventually when the other server comes by we ask him about the sauce, he checks with the kitchen, and gives us a straight answer.   Now, for the food. Props for it being less than 10 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we got our food, but we were less than impressed. Mac & cheese and baked beans were decent, but they were TINY and served in ramekins.  The order of cornbread is massive and it's pretty good. It is served with honey and butter, not honey butter, but a ramekin with butter and honey poured on top.  As for the other food, the sausage is delicious, but everything else was below average. Brisket was super fatty, chicken had that cooked-then-refrigerated-then-reheated taste, and the pulled pork was meh (and had a mustard-based sauce on it).  We did not tip Iris but did tip the other server we had interactions with."}
{"text":"Margaret Is Top Notch! Sue sat us down right away,  our plates were amazing!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Big Mess indeed. From start to finish this was a bad bad time. The server was pleasant enough, but that is as far as I'd go. We were there with a large group to celebrate a couple of birthdays. They seated us in the patio, where a good amount of the time it was too noisy to converse at a normal voice level. The potatoes in the potato / pickle chip app were great. The pickle chips were foul - too thick and not cooked nearly long enough. I ordered a 4 meat tray with hush puppies and slaw. The ribs were dry, and devoid of flavor without lots of added sauce, the sausage tasted like standard \"bought it at the grocery store\" kind with extra grease. The pulled meats (pork shoulder & brisket) sat there on the tray oozing grease. The hush puppies were nasty, tasted like they'd been cooked in old oil, and the oil had saturated approx. 1/8\" into the \"puppy.\" We waited for what seemed like an eternity for our checks, which were then wrong and had to be sorted out before payment could be tendered. I didn't care about the \"large group\" tip, but for what I spent to feed three of us, I've had far better food for far less money in other places. They can keep this mess, I will never return."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some good BBQ and typically I go to Lucile's but  I figured i try somewhere different so I gave the Big Mess a try.  Wow I was blown away with this hidden gem.  New Orleans BBQ Shrimp has great flavor. The Brisket just melts in your mouth, and the Fried Chicken was tender and juicy.  Had the Bourbon Q and my wife had the Bar BQ Bloody they were both great.  Not sure how we fit it but we split the Fruit Cobbler, for sure it was fresh.  Service was good she was prompt and attentive. I think we found a new BBQ spot. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This has been the best BBQ we've had in Las Vegas.  We're locals so we've tried several in town and we were waiting to try Big Mess until someone we knew tried it first but since that didn't happen, we decided to go for it and we were definitely NOT disappointed.   My husband got the full slab of Baby Back Ribs and since we wanted to try several things, I got the 4 meat platter which included the brisket, pulled pork and 2 servings of BBQ chicken (white meat for both).  The ribs were tender and meaty with a good BBQ flavor.  Everything on the platter was excellent.  The brisket was tender with a great flavor - no sauce needed but was excellent with the house sauce.  The pulled pork was also tender, good flavor and texture.  The chicken was also excellent, not dry and very flavorful.   The ribs came with baked beans, good flavor and texture and also coleslaw - which was so-so according to my husband.  With the platter, I ordered French fries and roasted corn on the cob, both of which were really good.  Both dishes came with a very good-sized piece of cornbread with honey butter that was excellent as well. Our server was Margaret and her helper was Jay.  Both were very friendly, provided excellent service and knowledgeable with good suggestions.   The price was reasonable ($63.00 Total which included our 20% tip) especially considering the amount of food we received.  We have enough left over for an entire meal for each of us for lunch tomorrow.   In a town like Las Vegas, it is important for locals to support places that provide good service and a quality meal so that they stay around.  We will definitely be going back - I'm sure it will be often."}
{"text":"If you want to get full on crappy BBQ meat this is the place to come. They are not shy about portions but the meats are flavorless, tough and dry!!! Price is Very Very cheap though and matches the meat quality.  Salmon and shrimp were excellent, what a surprise!  $15 for a great salmon, wow that's great!  I know where to go for seafood at least.  It is a smoking BBQ restaurant so you think you would taste the smoke on the meats!  I got the sampler platter. The briskets were dry, sausage was flavorless, ribs were tough, and it needed to just taste like it was BBQ, didn't even smell like BBQ. Use smoke flavoring if you have to, smell is part of the BBQ experience!!!  Whoever is smoking the meats back there, please, read about it, watch videos online about how to smoke meats, something has gone wrong!  A real man should know how to smoke meats, or, at least have a clue about it. So pull up your pants and do it for the sake of your customers.  I hate to say Dave's BBQ has this beat hands down, yuck I hate Dave's.  Arby's is another much better option! OMG!!!  We got the nachos for appetizer also. They were soaked and wet by the time they came out. There was no crunch. Please use real cheese on the nachos, it is a restaurant not a fast food place featuring nachos with cheese sauce. If I wanted that I would go to Taco Bell and get one.  No corn on the cob in a BBQ place???   Why does the Spicy sauce taste like something my grandma would use, there's no SPICE.  People that like spice want some spice, those that do not will not use it, this satisfies no one!!!  My son had the deviled eggs for appetizer. Again, they need more flavor. My wife's deviled eggs are better than these. She chops the pickles in small pieces and adds it to the mayo, this way they simply give more flavor.   I got to give credit for the shrimp appetizer bc it is good. And, of course the big beer. Every man loves a good big beer.   I will not come back here unless I see somebody gives a sh*t bc it doesn't seem that way."}
{"text":"While waiting for my grandparents and aunts at the Bingo parlor. My mom and I got hungry and decided to try out Big Mess. It previously was the location of Billy Bobs, which was a staple at Sam's Town for years. Overall, everything we had was good and nothing really stood out for us with the exception of their BBQ Beef Nachos. \"Umm...so good!,\" was the reaction I got from my mom and she is picky especially when it come to American food. She is biased with Asian food, LoL. The consistency and toppings of the nacho was delicious and filling. I would come back for this item.   For our entrees, I got the pick 2 meat platters meal and my mom got the chicken and biscuit meal. Both were good and quite generous in portion. My beef brisket was a bit dry but seasoned just right. My other meat selection was the BBQ chicken and that was good with just right amount of sauce.   This place is a solid 3 stars but the service we received was great! Therefore I had to bump it up to 4 stars because of our amazing server Blanca, was friendly and very accommodating. We also had the pleasure of being assisted by Jay. Another shoutout goes out to Ryan, the Manager on duty. He came around to ask us how we were and if everything was ok."}
{"text":"We had great service from our server Jay. Portions were large & food was pretty good. I had the beef nachos & they were really tasty. Also got the sweet tea & peach tea which were both very yummy. One thing though was after we had finished our meal, one of my uncle's wanted more cornbread which was great btw, but they were all out & it was only 7:00. Not sure how many they make a day, but that was kind of bummer as we were leaving the next morning."}
{"text":"The food was good. Nothing special. It was a half step up from Famous Dave's. Their portions are hefty for a good price, though. As a whole, the experience was alright. I was dining with a party of 8, and some of our orders were missing some things at first. They took care of it immediately, though. If you're looking for super amazing BBQ, this isn't the place. If you're looking for good food that will get you full at a good price, look no further."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this was our first time eating here after several visits to Sam's Town; it won't be our last.  While the service was a bit haphazard, the quality of the food was excellent (can you say, 'brisket'!), and the prices very reasonable for the quantity.  Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try another BBQ establishment but we were nowhere near the other place so I decided to give this place a shot. As I glanced at the menu, I decided on the 3 meat plate. Most bbq places don't give you that much food so my assumption was this place wasn't any different. Boy was I wrong. They gave me a ton of food. I was only able to finish 1/3 of my plate which was a sad display . The ribs and brisket were on point. Pulled pork could have been less salty but it was still good. The service was amazing as well. Will definitely be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Big Mess Bar-BQ. This very causal restaurant is located inside the Sam Town complex. It was convenient and clean. The manager and staff are very friendly and happy. The potion are very large and very tasty. We all had different items from the very nice menu. My baby back ribs was falling off the bones. Our attired party had a great meal and lots of fun too. The decorations was nice and fun to look at. If you have a large group call for reservation this will help the restaurant  to service your group more effectively. All I'm saying to the local people you must try the food here.  If you are traveling to Las Vegas this is  a great place for group and family. We had great food and service here. Thank you very much for accommodating our large group. I will return.  Gloria~"}
{"text":"Ok, it's in a casino, but the BBQ is pretty darned good and with the specials what's not to like.  I've had better in Texas but this is still pretty good. I wish they had a variety of sauces but as my dad said, the worst I've had was wonderful."}
{"text":"great food good people.  my husband and i had the spare ribs and brisket."}
{"text":"Margaret and Jay were both phenomenal!!!  Not only was the food great, but the staff was friendly and I can't wait for my next night out to get to visit again. I will be requesting Margaret add my server. She was amazing. Jay got right to you and got you taken care of as well. Both of you did great jobs. We will be back."}
{"text":"Oh man, wasn't expecting such good food from this corner hotel bbq spot.  Food is quality, portions are large, sides are great and the staff was really friendly.  Would recommend to anyone on this side of Vegas."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sam's Town but had never eaten at any of their restaurants besides Roberto's. We decided to dine here last Saturday.   It was a rocky start because I ordered the deviled eggs for an appetizer. Boy, I'm not sure who made the eggs, but whoever it was must have a love affair with salt. They tasted like brine. My husband, who is a salt person, said they were too salty for him to eat! That says a lot. TBH, this worried me because I was afraid of what else might follow.   Next up, the main courses. I ordered fried chicken and my husband ordered catfish (at a bbq place...) I tasted my husband's catfish and it was fried well, fish was fresh, but there was barely any seasoning which made it taste quite boring. His coleslaw did not look too good.. and he confirmed that it wasn't  So, I decided to cut into my chicken instead of picking up a piece and eating it. Thank God I did because it looked like a murder scene of my plate! The chicken was full of blood! Not good at all! Greens were on the sweet side but edible. Mac and cheese- Ok! Biscuit was as big as my face (and that's pretty darn big!! Lol!!) but was very boring in taste.    Waitress came back to table and I showed her my plate. She offered me something else and I politely declined. The manager came out & apologized profusely and said he did not want me to leave hungry. He even offered to make me a special fried chicken breast sandwich. Finally he convinced me to try the bbq sampler plate. It came with smoked sausage, brisket, pulled pork, ribs , cornbread and a side. Ohhhh it was DELICIOUS!! Especially the brisket! I've been to many other restaurants that failed in the brisket category but theirs is really good! The pulled pork had a bit of Carolina sauce drizzled over it! It was so good. The  ribs were tender and to die for! All of the meats were smoky and tender like I like it! Moral of the story here is \" Order bbq at a bbq place \" I'll leave the chicken to Popeyes and the fish To Mario's Westside Market on MLK in LV! Lol!  So your probably wondering why 4 Stars? I feel it's deserved. Manager handled the situation well with lots of care and tact. He did the right thing. Problems can occur at any restaurant, it is the way that they're handled is what counts to me. Not to mention the fact of the bbq just being plain delicious.  My husband and I will definitely return for more bbq. I'd like to thank the manager again for his fantastic service. You earned a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"This place has a few good things on their menu, sadly their BBQ is not on of them.  My wife and I were really hesitant to come here, as we had heard bad things. A friend of ours who works at Sams Town (though not at the Big Mess) said he came here when it first opened and it was the worst BBQ he had ever had. In his words, they spend a large amount of money on a restaurant grade smoker but never hired someone who was experienced in BBQ to use it.  My family wanted to meet us here for dinner, which is why we even decided to try it. As we walked in my wife asked a couple who had just finished their meal how the food was. The woman frowned and shook her head... not a good sign to start the meal.  We ordered the brisket nachos, deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes for appetizers. The nachos were the highlight of the meal, and the only thing we had I would order again if we return. The chunks of brisket were large and the chips were obviously made at the restaurant, and I love homemade tortilla chips. They also were hands down the best value of the night. The deviled eggs were very good, while the fried green tomatoes were a very small serving and came on a bed of marinara sauce. The tomatoes tasted very good, but seemed like an appetizer from and Italian restaurant rather than a BBQ place.  My wife and I shared the BBQ sampler, which has two sides and all five meats. The brisket was ok, but a little dry, the hot link didn't taste like it was made in site, the ribs were just ok, and the chicken was just bad. The chicken had no smoked taste at all and tasted like it was baked and then brushed with BBQ sauce. In fact that good smoked flavor you expect at a BBQ place was overall lacking. The best thing was the pulled pork, which had a hint of apple flavor and was juicy. Our side dishes were also good, and the cornbread with honey butter was fantastic. However, the price they charged is the same as you'd expect at a really good BBQ place, so there isn't even any value here.  My mom got the. BBQ burger which was huge and I tried a bite and thought it was very good. My brother, who did like this place more than my wife and I did, agreed the burger was better than the BBQ.  I also got my hopes up when I walked in and saw that they had a sign they have growler fills and saw on the menu they dinner flights. As a huge fan of craft beer I was excited to try what they had. Unfortunately, nothing they have in draft is what I would consider true craft beer. Their selection was about 12 beers that anyone into beer will have had before, and nothing was local. I have no idea why anyone would ever pay for an overpriced growler fill here when aces and ales is down the street with cheaper prices and a far better selection.  In the end, nothing was bad enough to turn me off this place, and I would give it another try. It wasn't the worst BBQ I had ever had (though that chicken was close). Their BBQ probably deserves 2.5 stars, but everything else was decent. If this place dropped their prices just a little and improved the quality of their meat, it could be pretty good."}
{"text":"All the meat was dry.  Either left over from previous night or way over cooked.  Mac and Cheese was pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food and the server Iris was very helpful and very nice suggested some good meals. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a BBQ place like this.  I moved from Kansas to Vegas eleven years ago.  This place is surprisingly comparable to the best and most awarded BBQ house back home.  Pulled pork shoulder BBQ is amazing.  Serving portion good.  Tables - spaced enough for you not to bump to your neighbors which is my OCD. The staff from host to bar back all with smile.  The manager touch is highly commendable.  He asks like a host at a home party...amazing, very friendly and  accommodating....Bravo sams town you got a winner."}
{"text":"According to my wife, best beef ribs in town. Good menu. Fair prices. It's in a Casino - but not noisy or smoky."}
{"text":"November 3, 2016.  Never crazy about trying a recently opened places because they usually haven't worked the \"bugs\" out yet and I'm afraid that sums up our experience.  The food was decent, but I've had much better.  We started by asking the waiter a couple questions about the menu items.  We asked if the appetizer Pork Rinds were Pork Rinds or Cracklins...he said they were Cracklins and made fresh daily in their restaurant...based on that, we ordered them.  Nope...they are Pork Rinds...just like the kind you get in the bag at the grocery store.  I would hope that an authentic BBQ place would know the difference.  That being said, they were very tasty with a hint of slightly sweet BBQ spice, though I doubt they were cooked fresh in house.  Hubby came for the Beef Ribs, but sadly they can only be ordered as a \"Plate\" and not as part of the mixed meat combos.  The Plate only comes with Beans and Slaw as sides, no substitutions allowed...OK, I like BBQ Beans and we both like Slaw, so we worked around that.  I chose a 3 meat combo with Brisket, Carolina Pulled Pork and Pork Ribs.  I ordered a side that Hubby wanted (Tater Tots) and Collards (for myself) and we shared the Beans and Slaw.  The beans were interesting with a good hint of jalapeno, but not memorable and I wouldn't order them again.  Neither of us liked the slaw and it went into the garbage.  The Collards were good and prepared well.  All in all the sides were very weak and being locked into NO CHOICE of sides on the \"Plate\", we won't make that mistake again if we ever return.  It's a shame because the Beef Ribs were very good...short ribs with good flavor and quite meaty.  Of the mixed meats I chose, the Pork Ribs were good, a little tough however not enough to whine about.  The Brisket was delicious with a little fat for flavor.  The Carolina Pulled Pork was my least favorite.  I usually like a Carolina Mustard based Sauce, but this one gave the pork a slightly spoiled taste.  Fortunately, they don't sauce it all, they just put a little sauce on top so I was able to eat the non-sauced portion.  Both of the table BBQ sauces were good....House and Spicy.  We may try them again, but not in the near future."}
{"text":"Brisket fries are a must! Love that they have Goose Island beers especially Sophie and Matilda. Good service and very reasonable prices. I appreciated that the manager made some recommendations and checked on our party a few times."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Big Mess BBQ on Aug. 19. Ordered the \"All You Can Eat\" selection. Asked for ribs, brisket and pork. The ribs were incinerated beyond recognition and dry as they could be. Not even the BBQ sauce provided on the table could help them. The brisket required a chisel to cut it. Tough and chewy would be an understatement. The pork came out with a, what was described as, Carolina based type of sauce on it (mustard based) which had quite a kick to it. I don't like heat so I wish I had known this sauce was going to be on the pork. That ruined it for me. The baked beans also have a jalapeno base to the sauce they come in and, also, I wish I had known that. The only good thing about this meal was our server Roy. He was very pleasant and aimed to please us. He apologized for the food quality often. I give him kudos. We traveled a distance to Big Mess BBQ. We wouldn't make this trip again. Better BBQ can be had at many other places in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for my daughter's birthday and so glad we did. The food is so good everything we ordered is so good and they have a big portions well that's what I think  the nachos are so yummy from our appetizer,dinner through dessert is so amazingly good and my daughter got her birthday goodies and the birthday song for us is hilarious  and our server is so great so we did have a good dinner and we walk out of there happy and full definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"We came in at 7 on a Friday night and there was hardly anyone here. The cornbread was hard, the brisket was tough and cut too thick.  Did not care for the beans or coleslaw. Tried but won't be back"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ! Hubby and I ordered the platter  with Mac n cheese, sweet potato fries & cornbread- we  loved it, it had great flavor & the sauce was amazing!  Robin helped us out explaining their menu & how they prepare everything- she was super friendly & helpful. If you are at Sams town you have to try this spot! Will definitely be back to enjoy some more tasty food!"}
{"text":"Not great but not bad. Service was good. Cornbread was dry, brisket was dry, sausage good. Great sides, potato salad just the way i like it. Fantastic fries. And the Carolina sauce was delish.   Give it a try, just my opinion. I wanted to see for myself."}
{"text":"They have only been open a week. But they rocked it. Thank you Jay, Reina and Chuck. Everything was wonderful. Food was not only plentiful it was tasty. Glad you worked out whatever kinks you might have had your first week. I don't give out too many 5 stars. Well deserved. Keep up the good work. Decor is awesome. Employees were extremely personable.  And the price is right."}
{"text":"Good barbecue, I had a brisket and sausage platter and my mother had the pulled pork sandwich. Both were very delicious."}
{"text":"The food was amazing..the portions large the prices fair amd the service superb.  The fried chicken was perfect as were the fried green tomatoes and a great selection of signature cocktails."}
{"text":"I come to Sam's Town all the time and I finally tried this place. Food and service were very good and great prices. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, I happened to be in the atrium and remembered Big Mess and thought, yeah why not try it again?  Everyone deserves a 2nd shot - and that's where the happy thoughts ended.  I'm not just disappointed, I'm disgusted with myself for trying again.  This time I did complain - and read my prior comments.  Taking care of \"part of the tab\" was a nice response, but it doesn't make up for the incredibly disappointing meal.  Figured this time I'd go shortly after they were open, hoping that the food would be fresh and hot.  Nope!  Leftovers is STILL what I come away with for an impression - and since I was so disenchanted with the peach tea last time, I was thinking it'd just be smarter to get water and coffee.  The coffee was STALE and luke warm, including chipped cup - and the water was served in a dirty cup...when I asked to have both replaced - I didn't see the waitstaff for 20 min's - and believe me, this place was NOT busy!  I figured \"oh look, there's people in there!  maybe the food is better!\" - so sad I have been let down again...fool me once, shame on you Big Mess, fool me twice, shame on me - won't happen again!"}
{"text":"Loved the pulled pork sandwich! The brother bartender was extremely helpful and pleasant. I also loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Another review of big mess there closing there doors as of tomorrow beacuse of corperate bs. Sorry to see them go im eating here one las time tonight. I love yall"}
{"text":"Pretty good, I had brisket plate and my husband had the beef ribs.we miss that great smoked for hours Texas BBQ.  But this was decent. I had the cucumber margarita,  big mistake. A little bitter and needs some salt on it. That's s was our first time here so may try again."}
