{"text":"Great service my wife and I had all you can eat fish  Well one serving will 3 large pieces of fish and fries coleslaw was enough for me"}
{"text":"For the past 4 months I've enjoyed a takeout order of the honey mustard wings. The huge wings usually come smothered in a delicious honey mustard sauce.  The order is so large that I always share them! Today was another story... The wings were very tiny, overcooked and not mixed in the sauce. Although, the small container of side sauce was good, it wasn't the same as mixing them together. My family was told that they don't mix the wings in sauce anymore. Unless this was an off day, I don't see wings in my future!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service, convenient location. Great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!"}
{"text":"SO HAPPY that they moved to their new location (Ridge & SOM) and away from Loehmann's Plaza.  the food is consistently good.  especially the Reuben.  the desserts are decently priced ($5 or so) and are HUGE."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch on Sundays after church. It can be a little busy but it's worth the short wait. The food is great and the prices and reasonable. They have call ahead take out which I have done a few times. Only about a 15 minute call ahead for take out and they always get the order right."}
{"text":"Always get the corned beef reuben   Always yummy food, BUT a bit expensive for take-out (lean Reuben with sweet potato fries $12-14)   The cakes are TO DIE FOR... But equally expensive... $5.99 per slice   I will say, however, that the cake servings are huge!"}
{"text":"Food is good. The French toast is amazing!  The wait normally isn't too bad especially when the patio is open.  We have only tried their breakfast"}
{"text":"I had breakfast there today and I've got to say, while there is very a traditional menu for breakfast, everything is done well. I appreciate the more adventurous items for lunch and dinner, which they have and also do well. My waitress was perfect and came just at the right moments. I will be back as this one is closer to where I live."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to come here every Sunday for breakfast. The bartenders were always wonderful and having a full bar to go with breakfast is always nice.  The issue is the new bartender, she's absolutely awful at her job.  Two Sundays ago my wife ordered a Christmas ale and the bartender offered a sugar cinnamon rim.   She rimmed the glass with honey first (awesome!) but didn't let the excess honey drip off first before dipping in the cinnamon.  When she filled the beer and set the glass down in front of us, there was so much honey running down the glass that it was pooling on the bar.   When she saw our looks over the honey covered glass she just shrugged, said \"nothing you can do about it\"  and walked away.    When my wife flagged her down again she asked for a new glass without the rim and explained that it was impossible to drink with honey everywhere.  The bartender visibly rolled her eyes, slammed a new pint glass on the bar and walked away.  My wife had to transfer her beer herself and then had to flag the girl down a third time to ask for napkins to wipe up all the honey.   We left without ordering and won't be back.  The food is good and the environment is good, but this level of \"service\" is unacceptable."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for dinner on a Wednesday evening. It wasn't busy when we got there we had to flag our server down to order our meals.   I ordered chicken pot pie soup and half a turkey sandwich in wheat. The soup wasn't good. It tasted like cream. And my sandwich came out on rye. I had a dried carrot stuck to the outside of my glass. My friend was happy with her buffalo chicken wrap.    Our server took awhile to check back on on is and we had to flag her down to get more drinks. I was totally disappointed in this place tonight I think it will be awhile before I come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in this past Sunday for breakfast. It opens at 8, and we walked in at 8:05 and weren't the only ones there! I ordered one of the specials: the steak Benedict and my husband ordered an omelette. The food was good. I would say my steak was a bit under-seasoned and the hollandaise was a bit thin for my taste; but overall taste and presentation (and servings) were good. Our waitress was nice and the food came out pretty quickly and the prices seemed reasonable."}
{"text":"People are great and kind. I love this place! Amazing HUGE wings with garlic sauce, breakfast BLT, grilled veggies, Manhattan sandwich, Special french toast all done simple but with amazing flavor."}
{"text":"My sandwich from here (Vermont Gobbler),was super weird, and not that large for $10. The description says that it has cream cheese on it. I'm thinking as a condiment, super yum! Nope. This had a thick slab of cream cheese on it as a topping. It was hard to eat, as you had to try to eat through a brick of cream cheese. I ended up taking off the cream cheese and eating it that way."}
{"text":"When my girlfriend moved into our new tow homes across the street I took a look around and recognized a familiar name. Manhattan Deli is somewhere I used to go to with my dad when I was younger. They must've moved to a new location but the food hasn't changed.   Since moving close, Manhattan Deli has been a regular place for my girlfriend and I. We're always picking between the Latkes and Corned Beef and the Pulled Pork sandwich both of which are incredible. The Latkes come with either applesauce or sour cream (or both of you ask) and a heathy portion of their delicious corned beef. The Pulled Pork is made fresh in house and served with delicious fries. Can't go wrong with either one.  A family style restaurant that doesn't skimp on details and great food. I'll always recommend Manhattan Deli to anyone around the area."}
{"text":"I love Manhattan Deli, but you are better off ordering take-out than sitting down to eat. The last few times I went, the service was painfully slow and we ended up waiting something like 45 minutes for a couple of sandwiches. I do love the croissant club, the egg salad sandwich, and the matzo ball soup, but I won't wait for it."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here for lunch with our elderly parents today, been here before, but it's been a while.  We were basically ignored while waiting for seating, until my sister stepped in front of my parents and glared at every employee on the floor, and someone finally came over.  We were seated at a large round table for eight, when there were plenty of smaller tables and booths available.....very weird. There was still tip money on the table but nothing else, and it remained there until someone finally came over and my sister pointed it out.......also very weird.  My parents both ordered corned beef hash with scrambled eggs.  The eggs were scattered over the top of the hash, and it looked pretty unappetizing. My sister and I ordered wraps, and they were OK, but nothing special, and the waitress wasn't sure who got what, just waved them over the table and waited for us to claim them.  We needed take-home boxes, and when the waitress brought them, one had a hair on it.......eeesh.  When we went to check out, we were again basically ignored for way too long.  They made us feel like an inconvenience, and unless my parents suggest going here again, it won't be happening."}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast before as well. Large bar selection. The fries were excellent"}
{"text":"Met my girlfriend for lunch, or tried anyway... She had 1 hour for lunch, didn't even come close to receiving food.  Waitress most inattentive server I've ever had, or close to it... 10 minutes to get a coke, 40 minutes to try and get a buffalo chicken wrap, vegan wrap and a couple fries...although it never happened in the allotted amount of time we had... It wasn't like we ordered something elaborate, and the place definitely wasn't that busy... Pathetic service, can't even comment on the food because we could not get it in 40 minutes time, would never even consider returning, and willougby location's website is such a piece of crap, you can't even complain directly to them..,0 stars if I could have... Up and left before girlfriend was late/didn't want cold food anyway"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast since Kleifelds is closed due to a \"fire.\" I had forgotten how much I liked this place. It's a nice, simple diner (but cleaner and newer looking than most diners).  The food is always good.  You can never go wrong with their sandwiches or corned beef hash."}
{"text":"Corn beef sandwich always taste so good with the mouth watering fries and pickle. Good job!"}
{"text":"Visiting family again and had to visit for a Manhattan corned beef sandwich. Great choices, prices reasonable. Definitely returning with every trip to see the family. Surprised at some of the comments. Prices good, but we are used to New York and Boston prices, but definitely not outrageous prices. Staff attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times taking interviewees out to dinner prior to residency interviews for UH.  We have a pre set menu, but it's good food.  I've had the plain burger (which really isn't so plain), the salmon and the greek salad.  I've enjoyed all 3 dishes and have finished them off or taken left overs home for dinner.  Also take a look at their desert menu.  The plain cheesecake and apple pie are delicious, but they have an entire case of good looking deliciousness.  Good for a sit down meal or for take out so head on over"}
{"text":"We are back into the fish fry season. We kicked off the first Friday of lent with the Manhattan Deli take out. The fish was overly fishy and the fries were very greasy. I know, I was asking for grease when ordering fish and chips but even my kids didn't like the fries. For $8.99 you get your money's worth in the food department. You also get the added bonus of falling to the floor in gut wrenching pain two hours after dinner. Be sure to crack a window.   The woman that rang us out was very nice and helpful. She made sure the order was correct and that we used our rewards card But the lady working the hostess stand probably should have called in sick."}
{"text":"The service was friendly but slow. A lot of the staff were leaning and yapping, as our waitress hurried to try and fill all of the orders she had. The I in team there was really unattractive.  The food was great, but super pricey for a deli. They're really proud of their $15 corned beef sandwich, which looks nothing like the photos on the flashy advertising screen above the bar. Sure it was good, but not fantastic.   We also ordered the chicken Marsala, Big boy burger and a veggie wrap that arrived with almost cold fries. We also had 2 cups of matzo ball soup, mozzarella sticks and a corned beef sandwich to go. Everyone had non alcoholic beverages and our bill with tax and 15% tip was over $70! For lunch! We were each going to get a piece of cheesecake, but not at $6.99 a slice!!!  Yes, I would say it's safe to say that your dollar does not stretch far at Manhattan Deli. Maybe they are true Manhattan prices? I'm not a cheapskate, I appreciate fine food, but damn,  son! Either way, I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nice salad. If the avocado could be riper, it would be better. But good and clean environment, staff seems friendly and diligent."}
{"text":"Had the Bronx Zoo sandwich..... Awesome!   Great fries,   Good salad.   Coffee was fresh.   Kids cheeseburger meals were as expected.      Would come back when I am in the area.  The open floor plan is very casual, but also a little noisy.   I bet the booths would be quieter but there were too many of us today"}
{"text":"We will go from two to three times per week to ZERO after this evening. The register staff was nasty when I questioned why we were charged for carbonated water. Their answer, \"it's a fountain drink because it has syrup in it.\" Seriously? I responded that we have been here repeatedly and only once have we been charged and they took it off the bill. The response, \"well they should have been charging for it all along.\" Buh bye Manhattan Deli. We have been loyal patrons since you were on Chardon Road. We will never come again. Your food is still good, but your staff has gone downhill to the point that we can no longer tolerate the incompetence. There are plenty of restaurants in this area who will take our money- and not charge for incidentals like sofa water.  Update: we decided to give MD another chance. Staff is better... Husband was craving matzo-ball soup!"}
{"text":"The new location is really fresh and has a nice patio area. The food hasn't changed, thank god! I broke from the norm and had a Gyro which was just ok but that isn't their forte anyway. Get the corned beef!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Manhattan Deli since they were in Willoughby Hills. They've definitely updated the vibe/decor to appeal to a younger clientele and that's a good thing, complete with a bar.   I ordered one pound of lean corned beef to go. The cashier was very nice and the meat was lean and very flavorful. We were able to make quite a few sandwiches. Waayyy more economical than buying individual sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place has consistently gotten worse each time we go. Today was the worst. After finally being seated on a very slow Saturday afternoon, I sat and thought, maybe we should just leave. The service was awful and the food wasn't any better. My sandwich was so dry I couldn't even eat it. The turkey on the sandwich was awful. Dry on the sides and slimy in the middle.  Then after it was all said and done, we had to listen to two bus boys cleaning the booth behind us dropping F bombs. Not worth the $28!!!!! Sorry MD, It's time for us to break up. :("}
{"text":"We love this place!  We would visit more often if we lived or worked nearby (and weren't worried about our waistlines!)  The menu is a cornucopia of your typical Jewish deli / New York City delights.  My personal favorites are the lox n' cream cheese sandwich and the \"Radio City Smoothie\" sandwich (goose liver) - the latter terribly, terribly bad for you but oh-so-good!  On cold days their \"cup\" (size of a small bowl!) of matzo ball soup really hits the spot!  They have a dessert counter you can't avoid as you walk in and out of the restaurant full of delectable treats you really shouldn't be looking at!   The main reason I like this place: wholesome ingredients!  The food at Manhattan Deli - whether it's soup, sandwich, meat dish, or dessert - is rich in quality and flavor.  Therefore, I don't mind paying the extra price for this premium food.  NOTE:  Manhattan Deli is currently located next-door to Giant Eagle in the Chardon Bishop Plaza (shopping mall @ Chardon/6 and Bishop/84) but they have tentative plans to relocate to the Pine Ridge Plaza Shopping Center on Ridge Road/84 (near SOM Center Road/91)."}
{"text":"Every single time I've been here I've had great service, seated pretty quickly. Servers and waitresses are very nice.   The food taste I would give a two out of five. It's OK but nothing special, I would never go here out of my way.   The prices are pretty ridiculous. Be prepared to drop some though if you go here.   I mean it's not even in manhattan?   Biggest complaint that I've had is every single time I've been here I've had something fatally ruin my dish. I've had hair in my dishes literally 100% of time.   Mind blowing"}
{"text":"Better than any diner I've been to ... awesome place, ended up here \"by accident\", intended to go another restaurant in same plaza, but they were on vaca ....  Nephew had their famous corned beef Reuben with homemade thousand island, awesome!! and I've had some of the best living near nyc. Metro salad was great ... strawberry shake had actual strawberries, awesome desert selection looks like they get it from a local bakery, yum yum, ....   Chocolate cheesecake, Snickers cheesecake, baklava, pistachio cheesecake, key lime cheesecake, coconut cream pie, German chocolate cake, strawberry lemonade torte, oreo torte cake, ...   Great drink selection too, nice wines, nice mixed drinks, .... Great service! Jody was our server, great!"}
{"text":"I can't count the number of times we've been here.  They moved from what was Loehman's Plaza on Chardon  Road several years ago and we were regulars at that time but the atmosphere left a great deal to be desired.  Now they have been in their new location for about 3 years I think and the food and service remain well above average.  Even today (Sunday) when it is always crowded when people are returning home from church, we only had about a 10 minute wait and were served within a few minutes.  I had one of their skillets and my husband had an omelette which he said was excellent.  We'll keep going here - love it."}
{"text":"First time at the Manhattan Deli. I was in the mood for a cornbeef sandwich, so my uncle recommended we meet there for a late dinner. The selection of food from the menu was very diverse from traditional New York deli flair to Lebanon dishes. Only going with four stars here due to the fact that I ordered a appetizer of hummus and flat bread. Hummus portion was large but ice cold flat bread wasn't even heated when served. I imagine that the bread was store bought and then just sliced to portion. Not unique in my mind. But this placed earn four stars due to fantastic service. Wait staff was friendly talkative and overall just a great experience. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"A simple, bright, clean and casual place to come! Relaxed atmosphere- large menu with appetizers, drinks, sandwiches, soups, salads and dinner choices- daily specials too! Nice and friendly staff, good for a story and a laugh! Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had the reuben it was tasty  however the sandwich did not include a side item. When i asked our server she said not enough people wanted sides so they discontinued  them.  The price of the sandwich did not change however. I thought that was strange."}
{"text":"This my favorite local restaurant. The service is always good and meals are excellent. Their menu is extensive, as is their dessert selection. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice, reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"Great place, super friendly staff. Good place to meet for happy hour. Nice patio, perfect for summer cocktails. I didn't realize they also do catering, great for grad parties, family reunions, box lunch."}
{"text":"At first I was disappointed. No dark rye (pumpernickel ) bread. But that was the end of my disappointment.  The lite rye with seeds was soft and good.  The pastrami was flavorful and in a generous portion.   To me the sign of a good restaurant is good coleslaw. Theirs was very good. Fresh crunchy, sweet & tart.    This place is actually a full service restaurant with more than your traditional deli fare. There is also a large tempting desert display, that I resisted.   Located off I90 it actually is an easy on and off the interstate. As I had my dog in the car I got take out to eat in the parking lot. Worth making a stop."}
{"text":"Very good corned beef. We also tried the home fries (which were awesome!), the mashed potatoes (which were good), and the matzo ball soup (good, but a bit bland). The people there were friendly and helpful. Their bakery deserts looked \"to die for\"... We will be back!!"}
{"text":"It's tough to give an awesome restaurant like this only one star. They have great food but their terrible service kills the experience. My boyfriend and I have gone here a handful of times and keep giving it the benefit of the doubt but we wait at least 15 min before our order is taken and our waiters never come back to check on us after dropping off our food. They aren't the most pleasant people either. Multiple times we have gotten up from our seats after waiting for our server to come over and just walked out. All of the servers see us sitting there but don't bother to acknowledge us. I've never been to an establishment like this before. We only go on Sunday's now for Brunch & sit up at the bar. The bartender is awesome & makes a mean mimosa!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! I honestly can't believe this is my first time reviewing or checking in at this place because it's right down the street from my house and I come here a lot! So I definitely recommend all the food here!   Their reuben is very good and popular. I just had one this week and the corned beef was nice and hot!!! Just Amazing! And the fries!! If you remember Burger Kings old fries that's what they taste like! Double fried crispy goodness!!!   I also recommend their chicken salad sandwich, any salad - huge portions, they've got great chili and they top it off with onions and cheese. They also have hot dishes like their crab stuffed flounder or ranchero chicken - and if you like mixed veggies their side of veggies is a large portion and so good."}
{"text":"We have been going to Manhattan Deli for years.  We love their new location.  The food is delicious.  So glad we can have a cocktail !!!  The best part of this restaurant are the folks that work here.  Each and every one of them is so helpful to all customers."}
{"text":"Great place. My family loves them...they probably don't love my unruly family. Absolutely the best fried fish dinner to talk about how much you love it, order the all you can eat portion then eat a tiny bit because, it turns out, you've eaten all kinds of junk food right before we went. It's also the perfect place ask to come as a reward, get two orders of grape leaves, eat them as fast as you can and then complain about being bored while your parents TRY to enjoy their meals.  Don't worry...as much as we love the place, we don't go very often."}
{"text":"Big delish deli sammies, matzo ball soup, salads, grape leaves... basically any deli food you could want and the service is fast.   There is a little bar and patio area if you don't want a booth."}
{"text":"Because of it's vicinity to my work, I tend to hit up Manhattan Deli for its very tasty and affordable Matzo Ball Soup and Salad deal.  The size of the salad alone is probably enough for one but add a \"cup\" of soup and you are stuffed.  The \"cup\" is really a bowl of broth with (1) baseball (maybe a bit smaller) size matzo ball.  I've had 4-5 different sandwiches off of their HUGE menu and each has been very good.  The service is good, seems like just a bunch of older ladies that have been there since its opening are the ones serving up quick, accurate orders.  The place is regularly full with professionals in the work force but that shouldn't limit you from getting a table at lunch.   I've been there for breakfast once and it was OK.  I prefer Baker's Square if I'm in the area.  I've never been there for dinner but pretty sure they serve beer and wine.    To me this is a craving stop.  If you are craving some good Matzo then go.  If you want a good sandwich and limited in time, then go.  Basically go for the food and don't bother staying for the ambiance, unless you want to watch CNN on a 30\" old school TV.  Almost forgot.  Girls and guys with a sweet tooth.  Stop in and try their desserts, or get one to go, I hear they are very good.  Large counter to buy everything you would expect at a small deli.  Not even close though, to what they have at Corky and Lenny's."}
{"text":"I'm really sad to have to write this review. My grandma and I came for lunch on a Saturday around noon. It was busy and we were seated in a booth after a few minute wait while the hostess cleared the table. Our waitress came over right away and got our drinks. Usually, I'm very easy to please. All I ask is my drink stay filled and that's it.   We both ordered the cup of soup and half a sandwich combo: matzoh ball soup and half a corned beef on rye. The soup came right away and was warm but not as hot as we would have liked. It was bland. Very little flavor and we found out it was the bottom of the pot from the waitress. We weren't too happy but finished the soup. Our sandwiches came and were luke warm and dry. My grandmother complained but nothing was done. We both decided to pay the bill and leave after we had our complaints ignored.   Overall, definitely a miss. The Mentor location is better if you want better service and food."}
{"text":"We came back for dinner. The reuben flatbread pizza is so good. The thin crust is nice and crispy with all the ingredients of a reuben sandwich. I ordered a Greek Chicken dinner with matzo ball soup and mashed potato. It was delicious. The chicken is juicy and tender covered with kalamata olives, tomates and feta cheese. The topping was a lot. The matzo ball soup is good. Big giant matzo ball and nice homemade chicken broth. The mashed potato is nice and rustic with hint of chunky potatoes. The gravy on top is okay. My wife had the chicken schnitzel and she likes it.  By the time we finish the food we were stuff. We couldn't resist the pastry counter looking into the cake case. We got a coconut cream pie and pumpkin cream pie. Both those pie feels like a pound and delicious. It takes two people to eat one portion of the pie. The coconut cream pie is creamy custardy with the balance of both coconut and toasted coconut.  Great place to eat...."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the corned beef sandwich. The sandwich always hits the spot when my tastebuds are in the mood for corned beef. Don't have the best experiences sitting down in the restaurant so from now on I get it to go. Problem solved."}
{"text":"I've been curious to try Manhattan Deli since moving across the street about a year ago. My husband stopped in a month or 2 ago and said it was great. Finally on Monday we went. Well since it was less than an hour before close we got our order Togo. When we walked in we didn't experience the \"oh my gosh we're almost closed\" eye roll that you'll experience pretty much anywhere you go. The hostess was friendly and ready to seat us.   So about our food. We ordered so much they probably thought we had he munchies, no we just wanted a little of everything. We ordered bacon cheese fries. Huge portion and they looked great. I didn't eat any because I had more than enough with my food. Hubby ordered the meatloaf dinner with fries and rice, 3 of his favorite things. I'm never sure about a restaurants meatloaf, what can I say, I'm a little cautious. But holy cow! It was soooo good! Don't tell my mom, but it was better than hers! :) the rice was also good, it had some kind of seasoning and peppers. The fries not overly greasy and crispy even after traveling in a box. (I stole some from hubby) I had the PM Cleveland, aka a chicken salad sandwich on a croissant with bacon, lettuce and tomatoes. It was good, not the best chicken salad I've ever had but it was tasty none the less. It tasted like it was lacking something, salt and pepper maybe? I'm not totally sure, I couldn't put my finger on it. I ordered onion rings as my side. Even reheated the next day they were good. You don't get that many (4-5 I think) but man those things were epic! Huge, thick cut onion rings. Good choice on my part. Now for the best part.. Cheese cake. When walking to the register they have a beautiful bakery case filled with all kinds of (I assume) home made desserts. The biggest cheesecakes and cream puffs I've ever seen! We ordered raspberry lemonade and orange Creamsicle. Both were amazing, enough to make me go back just for dessert.   Just some other points I like to make. The place was clean. That's always refreshing to see. There wasn't tables sitting waiting to be bussed. It was also bright and cheery. Also the staff seemed friendly. when we we're waiting for our order the other people came in seemed like they were regulars and they knew each other on a more personal level.   I even told my husband about 4 times they this was my new favorite restaurant. I cannot wait till our family comes into town so I can take them here. And I'll suggest this place to anyone! I'm sad we didn't try Manhattan sooner!   Manhattan Deli, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful deli sandwiches! Great homemade desserts! Nice atmosphere, good prices too!  I'll be back whenever I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Places like this are quite addicting.  I'm both sad and glad I don't live in the area because I'd be spending way too much time eating here.  Based on the menu, I think this should be renamed the home of the corned beef everything.  Corned beef, in various iterations seems to be the everyday menu item.  Not that I mind, really.  My biggest decision was deciding on a regular sandwich or a classic reuben, while my co-worker tried to decide between the pastrami or the philly steak.  Fortunately for him, the menu had many choices that aren't centered on corned beef.  I guess that's the point of a deli, though, and another reason why living near a place like this would be bad news.  If everything else tastes as good as what I did order, you won't go wrong.  The place was busy, even in the early afternoon, but the staff kept up, even managing to hold off on the eye rolling as these non-locals asked lots of questions.  Our server had a good sense of humor, and that made the food taste even better."}
{"text":"I was in there this week our waitress Flo waited on me and my friend the food was good like always and the waitress is the most friendliest. Will keep going. Great job Flo"}
{"text":"This review is an average score of this establishment's service...and their carrot cake. Service personalities wins a 5 star banner and so does this particular dessert. 5+5, /2 =5. That's 5 stars, my mathletes. This place is a purveyor of one of the world's top 5 Carrot Cakes.. capitalized \"C\" for its total divinity. Or, maybe i shall rename it Karat Cake...because this has to be 'ze gold standard. You heard it from me, it's hard to imagine how it can better than this, unless your rebuttal is to take home an extra slice."}
{"text":"Worth the short detour from the highway in order to have a \"real food\" meal.  Wished this restaurant was closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Love this place for all meals. My wife and I try to go there once a week. The staff is great and they have big portions."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. I ordered smoked turkey and it tasted like some packaged lunch meat. The server explained nothing and I had to ask for lettuce and tomato and mayo as the sandwich came dry with just meat and bread. Service was SO slow. They then charged me extra for the tomato on my turkey sandwich without telling me! Unreal. Tomatoes were not fresh at all. I will NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"I almost never write reviews, but I feel as if I have to. I ordered the Cajun Alfredo and it was HORRIBLE! My food was like warm and there was waaayyyy too much sauce. There was no spice at all to the pasta, it actually tasted sweet. I could not eat even a quarter of it. I tried and tried, but it was horrible. That recipe needs to be taken off of the menu."}
