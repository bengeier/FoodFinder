{"text":"Opening day!  Met someone at Hathaways and they told me about this place.  Glad I went.  The flavor of the meat was excellent, great portions and very friendly staff.  They have 3 sauces That are all unique on the table, but the meat is all smoked.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have just recently discovered the neon pig and I'm so happy we did! It doesn't look like much on the outside but the food is so good! Prices are also very reasonable. Both of our visits have been on Friday nights and business seemed really slow. I hope that more people will support this local small business and others like this instead of the large chain restaurants. Seriously everybody, you need to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I travel to Monroe frequently. I love BBQ and will always try a new place. I got a combination of Brisket and pork. I got onion rings as an appetizer. The onion rings were horrible. Frozen ones. The kind where when you bite it, the whole onion comes out. Worthless. The slaw was great, the best thing I had. The BBQ itself was just alright. Not horrible, but not great either. The brisket was flavorful, but The Smoke Pit, which is opening a location in Monroe, is going to kill them. I only got 2 small pieces of brisket and it was 14$  I left slightly hungry. Won't need to go back."}
{"text":"I wanted to love  this place. The name is why we decided to try it. Quirky, fun--BBQ obviously right? And it was all that. Dive on the outside fun eclectic decor on the inside. The BBQ pork I had is why this gets a 4 instead of a 2 or maybe squeezing by with a 3. The bun was soggy it looked like maybe there had been an attempt to grill the bun--but it was obviously a cheap store bought bun. I ended up dumping my pork and slaw and eating it sans the soggy bread. The fries were ok. Nothing special. The BBQ pork though--that's the saving grace and part to write home about. I hope they find a local bakery to get some good bread from and just finish that off to perfection. I'd go back for the meat but definitely would be avoiding the bread."}
{"text":"I am incredibly impressed with their food.  You can taste the BBQ knowledge.  Their product is moist but not mushy, or oily.  The smoke to pepper is well balanced.  The price is reasonable enough to make it a regular stop to get your BBQ fix."}
