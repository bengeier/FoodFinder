{"text":"We have been frequenting this place a few times a month since we first \"discovered\" it. I kid you not, he makes the best chili cheese fries. I can't even think of any other place after trying his chili cheese fries.   My other favorite is the \"country\" cheese burger. not sure why it's called that but the richness of the thousand island balances well with the smokey flavor of the burger. The onion rings are lightly seasoned with some black pepper and paprika in the batter. My son and husband swear by the catfish, and they get the potato salad to go with it.   Yes, the service can be a bit slow, but not in the way like they are ignoring you, but in the \"there is only one guy manning the orders, grill and register\" way. Which I appreciate and is often seen in these little neighborhood joints.   I will also say, that the owner remembers me when I come in, which I find pretty amazing considering he must see more than a few people each day.   Bring a few quarters with you, while I'm waiting I like to play \"Black Rose, Queen of the Sea\", good old fashioned pinball. He has other games too, but that one is my favorite."}
{"text":"There is a very large assortment of reviews and I think there needs some clarification. The guy that runs the place has real character and talks to customers like they are family. That being said this place needs to be kept in context it is in the ghetto and for the area is a successful locally run establishment. With that in mind they use pour quality products but that is what the people in the area are used too. This place won't be winning culinary competitions anytime soon. Not the place you drive out of your way too try but if you are passing by grab a cheep burger(not bbq) and kick back"}
{"text":"I am a total fan if this dive. I usually just get a cheeseburger with some fries. I have also tried the chile fries. The cheeseburger and fries are both well done. The chile fries are very decadent, go with the small order for a first try. The chile fries are a bit salty though.   The best part of the restaurant? The fact that it has all kinds of old school video games that you can play while waiting for your food. I pumped at least another two dollars worth of quarters into the machines last time I was there. It is great!  Don't let the exterior, or the interior for that matter, scare you, just check it out."}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price. Has tons of menu items, from breakfast to bbq to burgers, hot dogs and Mexican. Building is somewhat run-down."}
{"text":"This place is a dive, but the food is terrific and cheap. Still working my way through the menu, everything I have had is worth ordering again. Forget that quaint little scottish burger joint or the King of Burgers - get your junk food here - might take a minute longer, but it is worth the wait. Get their sweet tea, while you wait..."}
{"text":"Stop by here for lunch got a brisket sandwich and 3 piece fish and fries. fries aren't that great briskets ok  the fish was pretty good. I will have to come back and try the ribs and maybe give it a better rating"}
{"text":"As mentioned below, not the greatest atmosphere, but when it really comes down to it, I don't give a damn. I'd rather be eating a magnificent hot-link sandwich in a dusty, dimly lit place than a stale sad-looking sandwich at the bright and shiny Subway two blocks down. Prices are great, they have a wide variety of choices and of everything I've had so far has been immense. The guy who run's the place is wonderful-- we were there and the power went out from the storm and he just kept on making our food like there was nothing to it.  It is dingy looking and you might think twice before going in, but do. It's good. Oh! And they have catering, in case you have need of this in your life."}
{"text":"Last week I was driving down Broadway in Phoenix and a little yellow building caught my eye.  The sign read \"Mims Burger & Mexican Food\".  I made a few more passes by later in the week and last night I decided to bite the bullet and check Mims out.  The building appears to be quite old and the restaurant is nothing fancy.  A few tables and long counter style table with stools and some older pinball and arcade games.  The menu has various prices scrawled on it with some items crossed off.  Nothing fancy here.  The menu offers a mix of standard American fare, southern and Mexican food.  I was tempted to order a hot link or BBQ plate but I was a bit short on funds so I ordered cheap: green chili burrito and chili dog.  The burrito left much to be desired.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't better than a Don Miguel frozen burrito.  The chili dog, however, was quite delicious.    It took a few minutes for my order to be ready but that's okay.  Everything was prepared as I ordered.  They didn't have dogs sitting there ready to go.  I don't mind waiting for someone to actually cook my food.  Mims offers a lot of BBQ options and I think that may be the bread and butter here.  When I return that's what I'm going to try.  If they can serve up a good BBQ plate then I may have to upgrade my star rating."}
{"text":"I must have gone on the wrong day because everybody else on Yelp seems to like it. Overpriced and just mediocre. Very slow service even though there was only one other person in the place. Only good thing was the potato salad but it tastes very similar to one that I buy at the grocery store, so I wonder if it is made in house."}
{"text":"You might be tempted by the BBQ sign hanging outside, but you should keep going. We ordered a brisket and a pulled pork sandwich. Don't believe these are smoked meats. They arrived hot on a grocery store bum oversauced. Decent portion for the $6 price but lacking in flavor or juiciness. We sat in the side room, which didn't have any lights on. It was stuffy and dirty. Got a large order of fries. Wasn't that generous of a portion but was only $2 and came out seasoned. Truly a dive where they call out your order for you to go get, and they served the guy who ordered after us first, but overalll we left disappointed in the meats. Maybe for other things they are good."}
{"text":"This is the place Frank Underwood would get Q in Phoenix. I haven't been in this place for over 20 years and the food is exactly the same and just dam delicious. Fried Catfish, BBQ, Burgers and more with quick service and absolute quality and flavor..."}
{"text":"So one lonely night... OK wait... it wasn't lonely...  I was at a friends house...  And we were playing Mario Kart on the Wii (very fun BTW).  We got a craving for chili dogs (and no we weren't smoking!)  So, we headed out to Sonic, since that was the only place we knew that would have chili dogs at 10pm. We pulled up, looked at the menu and went... MEEEHHH...  So I wipped out my phone and opened Yelp and did a search for \"chili dogs\" and up popped up Mim's.  We pulled up and I'll be honest... the place was looking downright shady. If someone discharged a gun while we sat there, I don't think I would have been too surprised (this was late at night and the only thing that illuminated the weird colored building was one flickering street lamp). My friend looked over to me and was like \"are you SURE this is the place??????\" with a bewildered look on his face. I was like, yep, sure is! Just then, someone walked out looking normal and unmugged (I guess). I said, well, let me tell you this... 11 people reviewed this place and it still maintains a 4.5 star rating. It can't be that bad!  So we went in.  Boy was this place awesome! The menus is just outrageous. It has things on the menu that I've never seen before. It is a bit messy with things crossed out and white-out'd. But as another poster mentioned, it smelled good in there. Like, back home cooking where people made stuff from scratch, not ripped it out of a prepackaged box and  tossed it on a grill for 30 seconds.  BONUS! The place has old pinball machines and arcade games! HOLY HELL this is freaking badass! I'm actually glad the food took a while to make because it gave us a chance to be little schoolboys from 1986 and cram quarters and get our fix in!   Seriously cool and I will be back for more chili dogs and bologna and BBQ bologna sandwiches!"}
{"text":"The worst brisket I have ever encountered. Sometimes, the run down shack atmosphere with the dirt parking lot places are where the best food is found, but in this case the crappy outside matches the lousy food inside this terrordome. The entire brisket sandwich combo platter was a complete mess. I heard bells ringing in the back of this place which indicated my brisket was being nuked and then placed on the sesame bun from the grocery store. There was so much fat on this brisket that nothing was edible at all. I mean, fat ripped through every lousy strip of the gross meat that they claim was smoked on premises. There was some very yellow potato salad that was served as my side dish and it tasted very relishy, but not homemade as the the one employee said. A place just can't really operate with one employee either. It's time to raize this shack and let someone build something pretty and nice in this rundown neighborhood. worst brisket ever."}
{"text":"Not too much to look at from the outside, but wow! What a burger! Came in just before closing, very friendly staff, fantastic burger, and dirt cheap. Cannot argue with that combination."}
{"text":"I happened to pass this place again after many years and decided to stop in because I saw the sign that said \"Texas Barbecue\". I am so glad I did. We ordered 3 dinners,the pulled pork, beef brisket, and the pork ribs. Fantastic. I liked the pulled pork the best so I will definitely be returning. I ate the pork ribs. They give you 4 and they have so much meat, I was only able to eat 3 and I'm a big eater! The brisket was tender but again the pulled pork was divine. It did take a little longer to get our food, 20 - 25 mins, but I had no problem with it. We also had the pound cake but that was a little dry but still tasted good. Can't wait to go back and take friends."}
{"text":"A definite hole in the wall, but good food, reasonably priced, wide selection (take your time looking over the menu and all of the additional/small signs posted around). The best part is a dedicated owner who does everything himself: a one man show, so be patient, this is not McDonald's. He has been serving the community in this same location for 17 years. Bravo, Pert! Stop in, have a bite, and take a moment to talk to this positive, dedicated man who loves to serve you. If the atmosphere bothers you (it is not pretty) then take the food out to a park or home."}
{"text":"Dont pay heed to the negatives. I'll tell you exactly what this place is. Its a good place to eat without breaking the bank. I've been eating here since the late 90s. Back then they had an awesome $2.99 breakfast. I'm sure the price has gone up on that now but I still come for the burger meal deal , hotdogs and occasionally the fish. Prices are great and yes it takes time for your food to come out because they are cooking it! Mims is cheaper than most fast food joints and you get home cooked flavor and quality! I love this place"}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian breakfast burrito.  It was very good.  The tortilla and the sauce that came with it was spot on.  I really like potato in my b/fast burritos though and it didn't have any.  Lucky for me we had ordered french fries that were delicious and so I opened my burrito and put some in.  Perfect solution.  My husband and son shared the 18 piece chicken wings.  They thought they were okay.  Not bad but not the best they ever had either.  My son thought they were a bit dry but my husband liked that they weren't fatty.  My son also didn't care for the peppery taste vs. the vinegarry taste he is used to.  One of my girls had the turkey sandwich.  It was a hot sandwich and a hit all around the table.  Another child had the grilled cheese and it was just what you would expect a grilled cheese to be.  The lemon flavored sweet iced tea was real good!  Cheap meal for a family.  I don't know that I recommend it when hot out because the air conditioning doesn't work so well.  It does have video games and a couple of them were free.  Not sure if they always are or if we just got lucky.  This is the type of place that you order at a window and then pick it up to go or sit down.  Very easy for families.  If you want to tip and are using a debit or credit card then you need to tell the guy before he charges the card or it is to late."}
{"text":"This is the ghettoest burger joint I think in the whole world. From the outside, there is no way 99% of respecting human beings would dare walking in and ordering something. But I was confident in my fellow yelpers reviews and gave this place a shot. Ordered a 3/4 lb triple burger with bacon and large chili cheese fries. Very very good. I don't think 5 people could have finished the fries. It's way too much. Huge juicy patties and with all the fixins you want on it. Note to self, when ordering \"large\" from a hole in the wall, ask how big the large is. It's not always McDonald's large."}
{"text":"Just ok. Everything tasted pre-made and it wasn't anything I couldn't have made myself. The only gentleman working was certainly nice and had great customer service. I was looking for a great place to get pulled pork however, it may have been better to get a carton from the grocery store instead. The other dishes may be better but I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"Love the burgers here so delicious also ha e pinball's and arcade machines to pass the time haven't tried the Mexican food that will be next time"}
{"text":"Had lunch again at Mim's,  it's a 3 mile bike ride each way & that makes it not too hard to ride back with a full stomach!   Not much else to add except the food was delicious, the price was right and I enjoyed my meal.      Quarter pound cheeseburger with a fried egg on it is damn tasty eating!!  It should be noted that the prices of some stuff have slightly gone up since the last time they updated http://mimsburgershop.com/ - not much, don't get your panties all bunched up - just that a quarter pound burger is $2.50 now instead of $2.25 -   still a lot of burger for the price (that's with lettuce, tomato, etc)"}
{"text":"Mims Burger & Mexican Food was revealed to me by my sister and sometimes when I think about it (even when I JUST ate), my stomach growls.  The restaurant itself just SMELLS GOOD sitting there and waiting for your food to arrive.  The strange name would sort of, you know, ordinarily turn me off from trying the place because I think when restaurants serve this AND this they usually just serve two wildly different forms of food, both of which suck.  Mims serves legitimately good Mexican food, burgers, hotdogs and everything else.  Even if you're NOT in the area, it's worth going a bit out of your way for it.  Five stars.  Places don't get much better."}
{"text":"I will admit Mims serves up some seriously good food BUT the place is really small and super ghetto. You have to walk through a screen door then open the front door to get in like your walking into someones house( in the ghetto of course). When you get in its hotter inside than it is outside and it does NOT smell good. I walked into the bigger room on the side where the the games are and it smelled like a cat was living back there! I ordered a chili dog and french fries with an iced tea. They put real shredded cheese on the chili dog not the artificial cheese and the french fries were crispy and tasted great with ranch. The food makes up for the poopy atmosphere and if you eat here make sure you place your order to go."}
{"text":"Came in with little expectations because I was hungry, desperate, and very hungover. Dropped by and spent $8 on a triple cheese burger, with bacon, cheese, and fries. The burger was stacked high, had a great smoky flavor, and wasn't dry. The fries had some great seasoning on them. This place looks run down, but it does fit the \"hole in a wall\" description. 10/10 would eat here again."}
{"text":"Went to AZ with my baby over the weekend. :)  He had to stop by his home office so I chilled at the library while he went to work. When he was done, he texted and said, \"Be there in 20 with food.\" I was sooooooo excited because I know that my boo don't mess around when it comes to food. ;-) Actually what ended up happening was, we went together to get the food and yeah it wasn't ready when we got there but I know why. The gentleman behind the counter had cooked everything FRESH. I'm originally from L.A. so hole in wall places like Mim's are what I look for.  Loved the bacon cheeseburger and fries.  There's nothin better than a \"house\" burger y'all. LoL.  Next time, I'm gone try the catfish... :)  Oh and the outside of the place looks sketchy but don't let that fool ya.  Again, I'm from L.A. so sketchy neighborhoods etc don't bother me.  The food is yum :-D Try it. :-)"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ pork sandwich today. The thing is huge! I had to use two hand to hold it. The pork was falling out everywhere and the juice and sauce dripping down my hand. Although it is not the very best I have had (the sauce was lacking a bit) the value made it worth the 5th star.   I hear Mim also owns Cafe 36 on Indian School and Central in a office complex?"}
{"text":"You gotta try Mim's Burger & Mexican Food for lunch if you haven't tried them already!  This is a little \"hole in the wall\" place located very close to the airport.  Catching an afternoon flight out to \"BFE\" from Sky Harbor the other day I decided to give Mim's Burger & Mexican Food a try.   I was greeted by this very friendly man, the owner I believe, who was doing everything from taking orders to cooking and cleaning.  This place is bigger on the inside than what it looks like from the outside.  It's \"dive-ee\" inside too, but its clean and he has some really cool retro video games and a couple of pinball machines :^)  I ordered a double cheese burger with a side of fries.  He fried the fries fresh and I watched him cook the burger.  Everything he makes is homemade and taste very good.    This is another one of those places \"you can't judge a book by it's cover\", so stop in see what's available inside.  Mim's is a great place for lunch if your on your way to/from the airport.  I'm looking forward to trying his fried fish or maybe even his BBQ brisket on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I had to to try this place. I had the pulled pork with potato salad and some sweet tea. I was no where near being blown away like many of the other reviews suggest. At best, my meal was just shy of mediocre. The pork was reheated in a microwave and the bbq sauce was bland. The potato salad was run of the mill with a factory fresh quality. I suspect it is purchased and not made in house. Even the sweet tea was lacking. It's probably closer to micky d's sweet tea than anything you will get in the deep south.  I will say the place does offer value for what you get. It's just that the food is not special. What is special is the place itself. I will go back again and bring family or friends just to see the expression on their faces.   It's more about surviving the trip than it is about discovering a tasty hole in the wall."}
{"text":"We stopped at Mims based solely on Yelp's review.  Mims is definitely your \"hole in the wall\" establishment, and not much to look at.  I had the 1/2 bacon cheeseburger and onion rings.  The burger was slightly overcooked, but I forgot to specify medium rare, so that may have been my fault.  The onion rings were actually very tasty and crispy.  If you can overlook Mims appearance, the value is very good."}
{"text":"The ribs are okay, but the ambiance is lacking and not in a kitschy hip way, but in a you're gonna get robbed way."}
{"text":"Was here recently to pick up something quick for my boss and I. We ordered 1 club Sandwich and small chilli cheese fries (to share). Typically, I like trying \"hole in the wall\" places, but I was not impressed at all with this place.  The only man working greeted me and was kind/friendly.  I got back to the office anxious to eat. I opened the \"Club Sandwich\" and OMG!!! it wasn't even in sourdough bread it was literally on burger buns (better call it Club Burger). Any who the lettuce had dark spots and the bacon looked disgusting. I took my first bite and it just didn't taste like the average \"club sandwich\".  Next, we opened the chili cheese fries. NOOOO!!! the chili looked like it was wet cat food. Gross! the fries were so drenched in chili that they were extremely soggy. We asked for extra cheese (since most places are typically stingy with the cheese), well it hardly had any cheese!! ugh!   Safe to say we will never go back to this place. It was the worst \"hole in the wall\" type place that we've both ever had."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, but it wasn't an option.    I honestly don't think I've had the right thing here, but I see the potential.  I had the brisket my first time and it was pretty good.  Not the best, but pretty good.  The second time, I was dumb and ordered a Club.  Bad move, not worth it at all.  I need to go back and stick to the Southern food, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.  Having said that, their potato salad is great."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the peach cobbler is incredible!! I do not like cobbler that has a ton of slimy peaches and little bit of crust. This cobbler has the right amount of everything especially crust. The catfish was fresh and hot and I couldn't wait to get home before I took a piece out the bag!! I also purchased a rib sandwich with extra BBQ sauce and they over delivered. The meat fell off the bone and the sauce was amazing... I drive 60 miles one way just to get it and I suggest everyone stop by on the way home to take advantage of the best thing ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Takes FOREVER to get your food, if you have less than an hour to get food here, don't plan on going...or call in ahead of time. The burger and fries were super greasy! maybe you like your food like that but i am not that big of a fan. The burger is pretty typical, nothing special, priced pretty high for the quantity and quality you get.   It is a nice change of pace for the food that is around in this area though.  I would hesitate on eating there, really dark and the tables are super sticky...blech...   Oh yeah order at the right of the cage of confusion..."}
{"text":"Ive only visted this place once. I got a green chile burrito, it was okay. Not authentic at all but it was a very big burrito, service was nice :) the resturant is kinda dirty it does look well runned and ghetto but over all great service. Ive never returned"}
{"text":"This place is incredible!!!! It's what most people would call a Hole-in-the- wall, and that's not a bad thing because these types of places are where you will find the best food. I'm from Louisiana and the menu here reminds me of menus you would find down South. I ordered the Hot link sandw"}
{"text":"I was driving on the way back from a My Brother's Keeper event and was hoping to stumble upon a locally owned place to grab some grub around 10:30am. I initially drove past this place, but I was intrigued by the signage on the outside and had to turn around half a mile later just because the exterior touted everything from spicy burritos to famous BBQ.   This place is the definition of a hole-in-the-wall; it's not the fanciest establishment by any means, but it definitely has its charm. You walk in and you'll notice a picnic table to your right, bar-style seating on the close wall, and a handful of arcade games and pinball machines. I walked in and it immediately reminded me of some of my favorite BBQ places that I visited in Texas, and I was sold.  With it being so early, I ended up buying a breakfast burrito stuffed with egg, chorizo, cheese and potatoes. For the price, the burrito was HUGE! It was easily over a foot long and, while it wasn't very wide, it was tasty and very filling. I got it accompanied with a cup of lemon sweet tea and it all came out to five dollars and some change. I'm kicking myself for not trying something a little more sophisticated, but I will definitely try to swing by and try some of the BBQ if I ever wander into that side of Phoenix again."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. On a stretch of relatively empty Broadway, this place stands out, to judge this place from the outside, you'd drive right by. Don't! Amazing food, freshly prepared. Local places like this don't exist anymore. Who'd've thought a fried fish sandwich could taste so good? I'll definitely be making the trip back here!"}
{"text":"A regular burger that tasted not like cafeteria food but Great. It had the usual suspects on it, nothing fancy to trick you into thinking it was special. No special sauces.  My friend and I both got the 1/2lb (double patty) and added cheese and bacon. The burger meat was damn flavorful on its own and the bacon was thick and crispy. The onion rings were super flavorful too. I'll hit this place up again when passing through. I have to imagine the catfish is great too. -Southern bearded boy"}
{"text":"This is a good place to grub I went here a few weeks back. Got a simple burger and fries and I thought afterwards that I will be returning to sample taste there other dishes. cool thing about this place is the old school pin ball machines and oldie type games ."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the Phoenix Area, Move over Honey Bears and those fans of Stacy's.  \"slow cooking is the true artform of tender bbq.\"   Could I be more bold than this review.  This place defines a hole in the wall restaurant and produces the best food and experience it can offer with out selling out.  From the employees that will try their best  to learn your name to the love in the food with the Texas feel.    I put my credibility on the line for this \"hole in the wall joint\" What an experience.  East of Broadway and 24th St. this building has proved to be a destination location for greatness.  One of the hardest things a business can  do is stand alone and not become successful because of traffic rates or marketing investments.   At anytime you can see that people drive and walk far to support the location.    Take my advice if you want the Best BBQ and respond with a review of your own."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but I didn't. It was really dirty. The BBQ pork was overcooked and tough. The sauce was so-so. This place is mediocre at best. All in all nothing was really that tasty.   On the upside they have some old pinball machines so bring your quarters, wizard.  I think people give five stars to hole in the wall places just to be special.   Truthfully, I'd be surprised if my post actually gets POSTED since yelp gets paid to take down posts that aren't four or five stars.   Look into it people - do your research."}
{"text":"Wow! Great little hole in the wall place. Great prices and the food is damn good. Had the country burger and fries with a lemonade sweet tea. Just great. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside, but serves up awesome food.  On a recommendation from DarrenC, I tried this place.  I drove right past it on my first pass, totally didn't even notice the little stand-alone building sitting back from Broadway in the ghetto.  They have burgers, BBQ, Catfish, sandwiches, etc.  The owner is, apparently, a preacher and likes to blast emotional, uplifting gospel-type music which, surprisingly, adds to the enjoyment of the place, and I am not a fan of church or religion.  Oh, and the best part.... they serve up sweet tea.  If you work around here, just try it, you will be adding it to your rotation, guaranteed."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ! I don't care who you are, you will fall in love with this chef's cooking! I just left there and man I'm driving right back. Looks are deceiving, don't let the location fool you. You might have just passed on the best burger joint in South Phoenix. Thank you Mim for that delicious burger."}
