{"text":"I cane to sorrento under recommendation from my coworker.  I was told that the owner also has a retaurant at Sorrento, Italy.  They definitely originated from the Almalfi Coast.  I do agree w. Commentators below that service can be better and improved because they were really cool and \"poker face\" but I managed to make him smile in the end.  I think they just need some warming up to it.  But we really should talk about the food not just only service (apologize and no offence to others).  the food was good, authentic and made all homemade.  The calamari was crispy and not oil.  It was fresh and very generous portions.  We were full from eating it.  I could not finish my main course.  I ordered the lobster ravioli with tomato cream sauce.  the sauce was very rich and creamy.  It was paired perfectly to the lobster cheesy ravioli.  It was hearty.  And i was amazed how the the ravioli filling had real lovster.  The seafood pasta was fresh and full of seafood or ocean like flavours. The pasta was homemade with a press.  The pasta was a little harder than al dente but i was satisfied with it.  I tend to like pasta or noodles hard because it gives from for sauce absorbtion to make it softer.  I definitely enjoyed the meal and really enjoyed it.  It was not the cheapest meal ever but its similarly priced as o&b, like fine dining.  But the food quality is definitely as good or even better than o&b."}
{"text":"I love Sorrento.  Worth the trip to Vaughan!  So sad Nino closed the Yonge St location but the Vaughan location seems to get the business which is very much deserved (and appreciated by the regulars)....All the wine is good, even the housewine.  The wine list lists precise info about the grapes and sugar rating :) Nino is an excellent host."}
{"text":"Had our work  Christmas party here. Restaurant decor and atmosphere very nice. Food was very good but some dish portions are tiny. I had the arugula salad and eggplant parmigiana which were both delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but inadequate service and unjustifiably high prices.  Lively atmosphere.  This restaurant hasn't been open too long so it could be teething pains, but the service was pretty inattentive and we found ourselves looking around a lot for our waiter and ended up having to desert from the owner who's excuse was that it was was the busiest time (Saturday night).  So what?  This wouldn't be too big a deal in a cheaper restaurant, but we paid $160 plus tip for 2 starters, 2 entrees, a glass of wine and desert.  I expect more at those prices.  We had pan-fried scallops (delicious) and bufala mozzarella Caprese salad (the tomatos were tasteless), lamb ragu rigatone (good) and veal chop (pretty good but vegetables on the side were soggy - in a $30 plate).  We finished with a cream filled puff pastry which was rather dry and uninteresting.  Once again, the food was pretty good, but combined with a relatively high price and mediocre service, it only gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"I was there with my family - five adults.    Food was tasty but they need better quality control. Service was disappointing.  The place was a little small for the crowd in the restaurant but the ambiance is relatively casual for a more upscale place.  Upon entering, the staff was friendly and we were seated within a few minutes of arriving.  The food:  Overall, the food was quite good.  There were some excellent dishes and there were a couple of mediocre dishes.  We split several appetizers and pastas between us to start.  The eggplant parmegiana was unbelievably good. The cured meats in the anti-pasto plate were also quite good.  The pastas and gnocchi were well prepared, though unspectacular.    For the mains, we ordered one of the fish specials, a rib-eye for two, the veal chop, and another pasta special.  We pretty much split everything, so I was able to try all of the food.  The veal chop was excellent. The rib-eye was cooked perfectly and came with an assortment of tasty grilled vegetables and fries.  The fries were not very good but, this is an Italian restaurant and not a steak-house. Again the pasta was good but unspectacular.  The fish was a bland disappointment.   For desert we ordered a creme brule and ferraro rocher gelato.  It was ok, except for the piece of plastic in one of the gelatos.   The reason I gave this restaurant only three stars, was because their service was indifferent.  One of the carafes of wine we ordered had a shard of glass in it.  Luckily, I noticed the shard before I swallowed it.  When I brought it to the attention of the staff, they said they were sorry but the owner started questioning us.  It was not impolite but he was not very apologetic.  I understand that things happen in restaurants outside the control of the staff but I would expect a little more than the tepid surprise shown by the owner.  I wasn't too upset, especially because no-harm-no-foul but most restaurants would be all over you to .    We ordered dessert.  The waiter came with our deserts and told us that they were complementary.  I thought that was nice of them, on the final bill nothing was taken off.  To make matters worse, my mother found a piece of plastic in her gelato.  The waiter expressed shocked surprise but other than a second tepid apology, they didn't seem that sorry or upset.  They offered us a glass of limoncella but after two incidents, I'm sure it is clear why we declined.   In most restaurants, if you find something in the food - glass or plastic - the management falls all over themselves to rectify the situation.  In this place, they seemed rather indifferent.    What started off as a pretty good evening, ended in disappointment."}
{"text":"Nino is a very nice guy. Very good homemade ice cream! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I will start by saying the service was awesome  For starters we had the calamari, stuffed eggplant and the anchovies   For our mains we had the lobster stuffed ravioli penne vodka chestnut gnocchi and the salmon  Us gentleman had the the smaller steak cut into slices cooked to perfection with arugula   For dessert we had ice cream tiramisu and the Mille foglie   Everything from start to finish was excellent, the server was informative and made some very good suggestions   This has need my 5th time here and I will say it's been very consistent   If you like pasta pls try the lobster ravioli, I have even included a picture of them..... absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"I recently went here with my husband and son on a whim and we are so glad we did. The food was fantastic especially the zucchini flower appetizer, the main pasta dishes and veal chop were amazing and their gelato rocks! The service was spot on ranging from the friendly and attentive wait staff (I don't think I had to pour my wine even once) to the what I assume was the owner checking on tables to ensure a pleasant dining experience. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"\"I like to make a little bit of the taste of Sorrento\", Nino Cioffi tells me.   The restaurant is in Maple, but the wines and olive oils are from Sorrento, and the cuisine is from Sorrento. It's how he ate growing up. Is there a regional difference? \"It's just the way we use the product.\" The olive oil, the herbs, the cherry tomatoes; it's all fresh and bold flavour that makes us feel like we really are in Sorrento. Whole adriatic salt-baked sea bass is served table-side. Delicately cracking open the salt casing reveals a wonderfully tender fish. Homemade Caramelle di Tartufo are luxurious bons bons of pasta filled with ricotta and black truffle, and enrobed in a rich porcini sauce. This will go down as one of my favourite dishes of 2014. There is such a jovial atmosphere as music plays and decadent desserts seduce my sweet tooth.   \"I want to make my customers speak Italian with me\", Cioffi enthuses."}
{"text":"I came in for some appetizers and drinks. Our server was cold and rude. When we first informed her that the eggplant was inedible due to how salty it was, she did not offer an alternative or an apology, and merely said that she would inform the kitchen. A short while later, she came over, said \"excuse me,\" with her back to us, and proceeded to remove everything from our table, including a full basket of bread. At the time, we had the menu open because we were looking over the dessert. She did not ask us if we wanted anything else. After we expressed our discontent with the situation, she said we should have told her we still wanted the bread. She should have actually asked us if we were done with our food and if we wanted anything else. She did not apologize, and nor did the management, who just made excuses for her, although pretended to be concerned. We still paid the full bill and were not offered any compensation for the experience. I would not return. The other servers appeared pleasant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a unique Italian restaurant even for north of Toronto.  The owners and menu is from the Amalfi Coast of Italy, so not the same old Italian menu.  The place is fairly small and packed most weekends.  Not the greatest place for kids because of the small confines.  The staff are sophisticated and knowledgeable.  One time I was here my wife asked to have shrimp to one of the dishes. The owner came out and suggested that we don't do that because they cannot promise that this will taste as good after being modified.   He appeared to be somewhat insulted by the request. Some might be put off by such service, but this is exactly what I expect from an authentic Italian restaurant and I was quite impressed.  Food is superb quality."}
{"text":"went there on new years eve 2011 (31 dec 2010) - ambience was nice and cozy - service was slow but still ok as we were talking, need to be a bit more professional as in let the customer finish the food (at least down to 20% left on the plate) before asking if they could take them away (we still have mostly 50% of the food on the plates when they asked) - we had to say no no pls leave it 4 times - we were eating and talking, they asked immediately if we have finished when we placed our utensils down - find this really rude  - price point - expensive for the portion you are getting - I expected more on the appetizers' price point - food - was delicious, so this is the part I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Decor was ok, food was mediocre and the prices were extremely high. Nothing special....Just cant fathom spending 20.00 on a bowl of pasta! I mean, come on...its not like there were truffles in the sauce."}
{"text":"Nice family run italian restaurant in. Residential area, recommended by one of my Italian friends.  It was Friday evening at 8:00pm, the restaurant is not busy, half of the tables occupied. We ordered an calamari with shrimp as appetizer. It was not a big volume, but nice presentation and tastes not bad, not great but good mainly because it costs $22 just for an appetizer, normally you would have high expectation.  Extra 6 dollars for adding the shrimp, which i thought it could be bigger and more notisable, but it was not. I would not recommend it to add shrimp with extra $6.00.  We each ordered a pasta, one is the zukini (signature) pasta, one is seafood pasta and the other is mushroom pasta.  They are all very tasty and house made pasta with lots of flavors. Highly recommended, but a little pricy with relatively volume. The lady served us was very nice and attentive, introduced every specials on the menu, came to our table many time to check.  But one thing quite disappointing, That was my birthday dinner and I mentioned it to the waitress, thought there would be a little cake from the kitchen, but it didn't come. Many tables were celebrating birthday that night and the chef brought out a little cake with candle, even sang birthday song. Not sure if people paid for that.  We were full after the pasta and the bill came up at $120 , so we thought we just will have our birthday cake at home. Little pricy for just 1 appetizer and 3 pasta dinner.  But the taste is quite good for the pasta. We might come back in the future, but not very soon for sure."}
{"text":"Near the corner of Bathurst and Major Mac, this place is a well hidden gem. Really hungry and wanting dinner to go, I had called while my kid was at a late class nearby.  The lady that answered the phone was just as friendly and helpful in person. The atmosphere seemed cozy and friendly.  I ordered vegan penne with rose sauce for my child who has an egg allergy. For me the gnocchi in tomato sauce. Both were simple and delicious. They also added some fresh bread, tasted like Ace bakery.  We also brought home plenty of bacio gelato, fresh made in house. OMG full from pasta but still had to taste this. Incredible and we've got leftovers!  Price matches the quality. We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"This place is located in a plaza right off major Mackenzie. The food here is amazing tasted fresh and home made. They always have great specials and couldn't ask for a better menu. The service here is great very friendly and attentive and never forget anything you ask for! I had the Seafood plate and my mom had the spaghetti bolognese. She's very picky with her meals and she loved it! Will be back"}
{"text":"This is a nice little Italian restaurant conveniently located in a busy part of Vaughan. The restaurant seats about 15 tables, most small 2-4 people ones so make sure you make a reservation in advance.  The service is superb. The staff is friendly and attentive. One guy, who I presume is the owner or head chef, goes from table to table to say hello to the patrons, I can tell there's a lot of repeat customers.  The food is quite good as well. I had an arugula salad with fresh Parmesan cheese to start and it was light and appetizing. The menu is a small one but their classic items are all well received."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group a while back for a family celebration.  It's really clear that they want to build relationships here. Its really clear that they want to bring you back and they do a great job of it.  The staff is friendly and they were will to accommodate every type of request that we threw at them (and there were a few of them to boot).   The Penne Ala Vodka was great and so was their Bruscetta. It's a great place to go on a fancy date with if you live in the Richmond Hill/Maple area.  Eat Well!"}
{"text":"It's quite a shame. The restaurant was nicely decorated. It was empty, so there was no rush. We came in a party of 8. Server was nice and attentive. Problems started with the food. In restaurant menu was missing a bunch of items that were on the online menu (no risottos, no veal scallopini) Appetizers - sardines and eggplant parm were small but very tasty. Fried calamari was tiny, without flavour, and have more weird vegetable pieces than actual calamari. Mains: Lamb, and homemade gnocchi were delicious. Seafood pasta - pasta was very al-dente, and really thick (poorly made) while the actual seafood tasted great. Steak - small thin, improperly cooked. Fish - underseasoned and flavourless. Sides/Veggies - were utterly disgusting. All were boiled in water with weird underlying pieces and flavours. Were impossible to eat. On top of that my wife got 3 pieces of ROTTEN brocolli. ZERO reaction from the restaurant other than to bring a new side... that tasted just as bad. Will definitely NOT be returning."}
