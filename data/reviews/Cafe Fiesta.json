{"text":"The owner is so nice. First time we walked in she treated us as old friends. She was amazing, as was my cheesecake! My sister had her warm brownie, and we were all happy. Going back!"}
{"text":"Cafe Fiesta is basically a mom & pop sandwich shop inside of an old Quiznos.  I wouldn't call them organized, efficient, or all that interested in the appearance of their restaurant.  What they are interested in, however, is making a good sandwich and selling it for a reasonable rate.  For a businessman wanting a quick lunch during the week that fills me up and won't break the bank, this place is perfect.

I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and a coke - I believe the total was less than $5.  They served it on huge slices of fresh bread with multiple mounds of chicken salad.  In case you are as picky as I am when it comes to chicken/tuna/egg salad, I'll warn you theirs has grapes, maybe cranberries, and nuts of some sort with just the right ratio of mayo to chicken.  I loved it.

Only two people behind the counter, so I am told there will often be a line at lunch during the week, but I only experienced one person in front of me.  I guess there is a training salon of some sort nearby (Aveda???), so many students frequent this establishment.

Cafe Fiesta is in the rotation."}
{"text":"Terrible! This place is basically a dive. The atmosphere is awful. The service HORRENDOUS. And the food is not great. The chips are always cold. And when I had fajitas the chicken tasted so bad I spit it out! I told the server but she either didn't care or didn't understand me. I was overcharged as well and had to ask her to go back and get me the right bill. I can't believe how long it took for me to get good when there was hardly no one in the place. This place is depressing and lame. Spend your time somewhere else."}
{"text":"The owner is such a sweet person and really knows how to prepare what she serves. I had the steak sandwich and the flavor blew me away. I am addicted to that beast. You must order it. Also tried the chicken quesadilla amd had passion fruit juice. It was ALL good. I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"Great place! Service was so friendly (they put some mango slices for our large group as they were preparing our order) and the Cuban sandwiches are boss. Full disclosure: I'm from Florida. Cafe con leche coffee was decent, but not fantastic. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent service very nice staff. Food is very cheap. Great taste. Very clean location.... Free coffee from 8:00am until 10:00 am...."}
{"text":"Cute little local spot with the sweetest owner. The Cuban sandwich was good and the passion fruit juice was very tasty. The tamale combo came with 3 tamales. My only complaint is that the tamales were a little dry from being reheated. Overall, I would recommend this little local restaurant."}
{"text":"Cute little place owned by an older Spanish woman. She cooks everything in front of you and it's cheap. Got a sausage, egg and cheese croissant just now. I'm happy."}
{"text":"In the mood for a sandwich and at a loss after discovering Laurel Market's closing - I decided it was time to give Cafe Fiesta another shot. Though (as noted by others) they are lacking in speed and efficiency, they do have a few things setting them apart these days.
1) their own menu boards: bfast, sandwiches, salads, soups, coffees, iced coffees. and 

2) smoothies and juices, a fairly extensive list that can be blended with water, milk, 
yogurt, or other flavors. 

3) blue bell ice cream.

4) their \"half\" sandwich is really a whole. (is a whole double stuffed? double decker? I have no idea)

5) the bread of my turkey club was toasted perfectly, my turkey warmed just enough, and my bacon was reheated like it should have been. (sometimes that level of crisp perfection is not the easiest to achieve) 

still lots of desserts and fresh fruit, and although they had mostly repainted they had left one quip up from the previous tenant. As far as the \"fiesta\" part goes - their daily specials seems to be one of the few reminders (quesadillas, fajitas), but the women behind the counter were extremely kind and I may be more inclined to return now with all the juice options (including guava, tamarind, mango) - even though it looked like they no longer carried pretzel bread."}
