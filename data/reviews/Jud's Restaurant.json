{"text":"Juds has been in Monroe since the 50's.  It is an affordable vegetable plate kind of place.  They have very good fried chicken on Sundays and do a large lunch crowd.  We also love their Macaroni and Cheese. Very good!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  I never would have tried it if it had not been suggested to me by a friend but I'm glad I did.  I got their barbecue sandwich which was really good."}
{"text":"I love Thursdays at Jud's. Country style steak rice and gravy chop turnip greens macaroni and cheese. Makes me think of my childhood. Service is fantastic prices are great. Comes out so fast you swear they knew you were coming."}
{"text":"Jud's is a modest, unassuming restaurant that offers standard Southern fare without any bells or whistles. The almost-diner-style restaurant's only bell or whistle is its daily lunch special that offers up to 3 sides of your liking with, of course, the meat of the day... all for a very decent price (~$6 more or less). Located literally on 74, Jud's sits right past an overpass and merging traffic lane, making it easy to overlook for first-timers; however, once one pulls in, ample extra parking is available at the back of the establishment.  Ultimately, Jud's is a Monroe staple and has been serving residents consistently satisfying food for many years. Its long-running success is not a surprise to anyone.

{"text":"Jud's is a plain, modest, homestyle restaurant. There is a good amount of seating inside. Definitely a family restaurant with very friendly servers.   The portion sizes are larger than normal, so much so I couldn't finish my meal. The special of the day was country style steak and it came with three sides. I chose a side salad with mac-n-cheese and greens. The food was quite flavorful as you would expect from a good country restaurant.   The prices here are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. The service was unbelievably quick-I received my food within five minutes of ordering. One of the country staples in the Monroe area, according to the locals."}
{"text":"I just witnessed the cook stick his finger in the food to test the temperature. Wow wow wow.  So they have the sides just sitting in the heated buffet pans.  You can see this when your standing at the register.  First and foremost the food was terrible, no seasoning definitely not fresh. Everything is frozen from a bag or out of a can. This place was good about 20 years ago, not now.  The food has progressively gotten worse over the years. It has been a year or so since eating here, because I had a questionable experience the last time. Upon eating roughly half my food, it was time to go. While paying at the register another patron sitting beside me sent his food back for being cold. I watched the cook stick his finger in the mac & cheese, green beans, breaded steak and gravy and something else.  Then he proceeded to tell the other woman helping him \"make sure you stir it up first, it's warmer in the bottom.\"  Where is the health department when you need them.    It's not worth it people. PS, I've eaten Juds at least 50 times in my life. I will never go back nor would I recommend."}
