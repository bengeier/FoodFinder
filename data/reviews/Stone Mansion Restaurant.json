{"text":"We ate at Stone Mansion (now called Woodside's Grille) for Father's Day. We went early (4:30) so there was no wait and had the place nearly to ourselves. The bread sticks were very good. Both the French onion and stuffed pepper soups were delicious. My wife's steak was cooked just right and very tender, although the mashed potatoes were a little bland. The  beet salad drizzled with balsamic was quite tasty. We had the tiramisu, carrot cake and warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream for desserts and all were delicious.  The atmosphere was upscale and friendly.  Our waiter (Anthony) was attentive and service was quick (almost too quick!). The manager came by our table to check how things were.  Overall a very pleasant dining experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It is hard to find a place with good food where you don't have to put up with families bringing their noisy kids in there that run around the tables and fussing!  I guess that's why I refuse to eat at Olive Garden!!!  I had relation in from out of town and on their way home the day after Christmas we wanted to take them to have lunch.  I chose the Woodside Grill and we ate in the bar hoping it would be fairly quiet.   Luckily there weren't alot of people in their so we had an enjoyable lunch.  The sandwiches were quite good and their seasoned fries are excellent."}
{"text":"Thought we would try based on $10 off coupon.  Hostess was pleasant but other than that, service was poor.  All wait staff seemed to imply \"we were an inconvenience to their otherwise meaningful Friday pm\".  \"Owner\" was too busy re-living 'days gone by' imposing his services as a drummer on the band playing in the lounge.  (they would have been just as good if not better without him).  Casual menu limited Our bill was $48 but apparently we did not spend the \"required\" $25 ( we only spent $22 on a mediocre steak salad and horrible calimare app that was soggy and overly garliciky) to utilize our $10 off coupon but were told we could use it next time.  \"As if\"  there will be a next time..."}
