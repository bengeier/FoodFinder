{"text":"Excellent service.  Food warm and yummy. New place in our neighborhood next to KFC on Windmill. Clean place. Breakfast and lunch. We will be back."}
{"text":"So after having watched the Global Cafe under construction for some time, today my wife and I decided to pop in for some breakfast.  Pleasant surprise!!  Server was very upbeat and attentive.  The menu had good variety.  My wife ordered a build your own omelet, and I had the days special, which included two eggs, hash brown, and five silver dollar pancakes.  I added a side of bacon, and was asked how I like my bacon.  That NEVER happens!!!  I ordered \"crispy\".  Our food came out in a timely fashion, and was very good.  Being a breakfast food kind of guy, I can be a bit picky, especially when it comes to pancakes, waffles, or french toast.  The pancakes were incredible.  I'm not sure if it was the batter, or the syrup, but between the two I can honestly say it was delicious!!  My bacon was exactly they way I cook it at home, and was perfect!!  Both my wife and I agreed we will be back.  Recommend this place for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Great Food and great sevice!!! Will definitely continue to enjoy my neighborhood Cafe! Thank you Global Cafe!"}
{"text":"My first time here.  They just opened about s month ago. Excellent breakfast !  Served piping hot!  Three eggs with sausage and the French toast was excellent.  Actually one of the best I've ever had. Nice friendly place and staff. The owners work the dining room and kitchen so they make sure things are done properly. I'm coming back....Give it a try."}
{"text":"I was intrigued when this spot opened: they featured a diverse menu of dishes from around the world, but their price point was absurd ($15 for a breakfast burrito, $14 for a baked egg dish riffing on shakshuka, $17 for a burger?!). I waited to see how they would do before making the trek across town.

My recent visit found a pared-down menu (and lowered prices) focusing on diner classics with a few interesting \"global\" dishes thrown in- like the carnitas eggs benedict that I ordered ($13). The dish was tasty: the hollandaise had a bit of spice to it, the eggs were perfectly poached, the salty starch of the hash browns offset the richness of the yolk and sauce nicely. But the carnitas looked visibly old, with hardened and dark edges, and little to no flavor. For a place trying to highlight their more unusual dishes, this was not well-executed. 

The location looks like an old-school diner from the outside, and I received neighborhood-friendly service from Maria, multitasking as hostess, waitress, and busser. Their location is tricky, as it's not visible from the street and sits behind a closed fast food restaurant. Perhaps they need to drop the \"global\" aspirations and just be a cafe."}
{"text":"We came here for a bite before grabbing massages at the school around the corner, my boyfriend ordered the 3 egg meal, but can't have glutten, or carbs, so he asked to sub his bread and hash for avacado! He also wanted to sub his 3 sausage links for Portuguese sausage, in which the server informed us it would be a $1.00 up charge which we were fine with! Needless to say when our food came out, his $1.00 extra Portuguese sausage was all of 5 slices spread out on a plate to make it look like a lot. 

You know it's bad when even the server herself stops to ask \"is that enough food for you?\" As she puts your plate down. He wasn't going to send it back because he didn't want anyone spitting in his food. Furthermore we received our check to find out the upcharge was $2.00 not one for 5 slices of Portuguese sausage, really it should have been at least 2-3 whole sausages for that price. Needless to say we will not be returning here or recommending it to anyone!"}
{"text":"My daughter and myself were here for the first time time today . Wow ,  it doesn't get any more homemade than this .    .   Nothing tasted frozen .   It was cooked to order and perfect. Best food ever.  . Prices were very reasonable.  I will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"i had the make your own omelet. bacon avocado and spinach. It came with toast or a pancake.. i choose sour bread! all of it was delicious!  also ordered pancake and bacon to go.  I drank a good cup of coffee and water. great food and calm atmosphere.  the owners are great! definitely a go to  breakfast spot since I live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I am reluctant to post this review because every time I find a place I enjoy and rate it, it starts to become very crowded.  However, I must do this place justice.  Service is excellent!  Food is excellent!  Especially the carnitas Benedict!    Great place for breakfast that can meet the needs of many tastes.  Truly a Global Cafe!"}
{"text":"The menu covers all the basic breakfast choices. The eggs are fluffy and flavorful. I'm looking forward to trying the French toast. Fantastic service. Our cups & glasses were always filled."}
{"text":"This place is a great breakfast spot. People in Henderson can only go to a crepe expectations so  many times before you get tired $13 breakfast entrees. Good breakfast restaurants are all about getting people in the doors, feeding them hot food, and getting them out without killing their wallet. Great food, scratch kitchen, and a family owned environment. Recommend it to anyone. Awesome stuff!"}
{"text":"The food was great!! The pancakes were very flavorfull and light and the omelettes were done very well. The servers were super friendly and the atmosphere was very inviting. I would definitly go back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Where do I start? I was so excited that a breakfast place opened up close to our house! We walked in on Sunday at 10:00 a.m. & there was only one other table with people. Well, they're new, so not many people know about this place. Upon looking at the menu, we were in price shock! This place must have high rent, because the prices are equivalent of a fine ding restaurant, but the decor is not. The walls are half red and half turquoise blue, hardly a color which makes you feel relaxed or like eating at all.   Positively there were two TVs on the wall. I ordered the Eggs Your Way for 8.99. The ketchup was served in a silver soufflé cup and it was runny. The 2 sausages were fat, but when I cut into them, they were pink on the inside so they weren't cooked long enough, & I didn't eat them. I never send food back to a kitchen. The hash browns were o.k. and so was the rye bread. Our waitress smiled, she was friendly. Our food came out quick. We ate and left quick too. Sorry, we won't be back because the prices are to high. These prices are for an upscale neighborhood, and this area of town is definitely not that. Of course this is all my personal opinion, so you'll have to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"The server was so nice and the food was to die for I ordered the chlaquiles great price at only 7.99 and the Berry smoothie mmmm"}
{"text":"So, went by there this weekend and they have closed and an eviction notice was on the door.  Guess they never made enough money to pay their rent....Not a bad thing though because I think they lost their original cook or he stopped caring - last visit the food was not as good.  So long...short lived café..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place got so many five star reviews but three friends and I went to lunch here today. We got there about noon and the place was completely empty, not a soul in the place until we are ready to leave and another couple came in.
There are very few places that I give a negative review of and this is one of them. Service was great-but then we were the only ones there-but the food left a lot to be desired. I had a Reuben sandwich that was not only very soggy but the corned beef was very fat so you might want to stay away from that one. One other person in our group said her omelette was extremely bland. 
This diner has been open for only six weeks yet the online menu has been scaled down considerably. Several items that are on the online menu are no longer on the menu at the restaurant.
We crossed this one off our list."}
{"text":"Delicious food, family friendly, also great to meet with friends, awesome service, I love their coffee, one of my favorite breakfast dish is steak and eggs, their corned beef hash are also amazing."}
{"text":"You won't find a meal that you won't LOVE...We met there on Tuesday mornings for a networking group and the food is excellent, the service is great.  You need to check it out."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast there today. Service was fast, greeted when we entered.  Portions were large, food was served within 10mins.  Very tasty presentation was 10+
Will visit more often"}
{"text":"Saw this little place by chance on my way to my favorite yarn shop. Stopped in for breakfast and really glad I did. Steel cut oat meal was great with a little milk and brown sugar. Also had the French toast, really, really good! The coffee mug was never empty. Great food for a good price."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Fun and inventive. Must try!! Cafe is tucked back from road so don't miss it! Look for Chase bank."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a new local breakfast spot. We ended our meal with a frustrating experience using their coupon and that's colored my feelings for this restaurant (when they are trying to stand their ground over a $2 difference it comes off as incredibly petty.) The coffee was great. The food was OK. The staff seemed like they all might be working in the food industry for the first time (maybe family). The pricing is a little high -- breakfast for two was over $30."}
{"text":"We just had breakfast here and it was simply delicious. I had Eggs your way (3 eggs, bacon or sausage, hash browns and toast), the cost 6.99. Husband had a Cowboy omelet (4 eggs, bacon, ham, cheddar cheese covered in cheese sauce, hash browns and toast) 12.99. Plus 2 beverages. Total Bill $27.02. The food had such a unique flavor that is hard to describe, buttery and wonderful. They brought us out vanilla muffins to start and they were great. Portion size is on the large size. We will definitely be back! Going to try it for lunch next time."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Lots of good options, reasonably priced, great coffee- free refills! 
Simple ambiance/decor."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday morning for brunch with my sisters. The coffee was delicious and the food came out quickly. I was very impressed with the flavor and quality of the food - every time we go out we like to order a variety and share. We ordered the carnitas eggs benedict, \"baked eggs\", belgian waffle, and the western omelette. I found that i didn't even ask for extra syrup with the waffle which is completely unheard of with me since I usually drown my waffles/pancakes in syrup. It was just so flavorful it didn't need it. The carnitas benne was on point along with the western omelette which I could tell that the ham was pan fried for flavor before tossed in. This locally owned restaurant doesn't cut corners, everything seems to be made with love and it shows. My sisters and I are absolutely returning to make this place our newest brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Good food, quick service, quiet environment.  I went here on a Monday for a late breakfast. I ordered the corned beef hash with poached eggs.  I love poached eggs, but don't like them runny so I was pleasantly surprised when I was asked if I'd like mine medium. I rarely get asked.  The server was pleasant and prompt. She frequently topped off my water and if I'd ordered a coffee in sure she'd be on top of that as well. The corned beef was tender, and formed into a disk with hash browns before being cooked. The dish came with two of these disks and was a good portion. Eggs were cooked perfectly and toast was as well.  I like my corned beef to be a little salty, but it's probably best as is to please more palates."}
{"text":"The Global Café is a little hidden gem.  It's nice to have a little mom and pop feel place to eat where everything doesn't come from a can.  We had the benedict and the carnitas benedict.  Very good homemade tasting food.  We will be visiting again to try some of the other items, like chicken fried steak and homemade corned beef hash.  The hash browns were homemade and not from a frozen bag.  See you soon !!"}
{"text":"Foods good service is good
But it's 934 am and they are closed on a Monday morning epic failure when your drove 30 min to to get some chilaquiles 
You guys suck I'm hungry"}
{"text":"So glad to find a new cute cafe.  I had a delicious breakfast recently at the Global Cafe.  Eggs and potatoes cooked perfectly. Sausages yummy.  The pancakes were light and fluffy.  I can't wait to go back and try other good foods on the menu.  Oh, the service was great.  Everyone is friendly and you are taken care of!"}
{"text":"Service - server was really nice and attentive. Got our orders out fast and coffee and water refills are on point.

Food - Food was great! Delicious, cooked the way we wanted and hot! 

We used a Groupon. Easy to redeem. Will be back again. Great lil new Breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great coffee.  Probably the best breakfast food I've had when eating out.  Low prices, tons of food, and EXCELLENT service.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"They know how breakfast is done. The omelet was perfectly prepared and the portion was big enough for two.
The best part of this new restaurant was it's service. This is going to be a weekly stop."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic below the radar little spot. When I come here for breakfast I'm always surprised that it's not packed with customers. The food is great! At least, their breakfasts are great--haven't tried their lunch menu. And prices are reasonable. And--they have gluten free toast! (Important in my case.) Maybe people don't know it's here--set back on Windmill on the SW corner of Eastern, behind KFC. I mean, I don't mind the lack of customers because it makes for a super mellow environment where you can always get a table and spread out. On the other hand, I want then to stay open because it's one of my fave places."}
{"text":"Our second time visiting this place was very dissapointing. I'm glad to see that they were busy, but they were not staffed or trained properly to handle the business. The waitress forgot to give us syrup with our French toast and we couldn't flag her down for 15 min. She never checked back to see if our food was okay. By the time we got some syrup the French toast was cold.

The food was extremely salty on this visit. I'm afraid that the same person was not cooking as last time we came. The carnitas in the carnitas benedict was so salty that it was almost inedible. The poached eggs on the benedict were also undercooked. The egg whites were still runny. The hash browns and other breakfast items were also very salty. 

I'm afraid that my love affair with this place was short lived. I don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"This was the first time we ate there. Came with a family of 10 people and they accommodated us really fast and were really friendly. Everyone's food came fast and the food looked and tasted great!"}
