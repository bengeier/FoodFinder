{"text":"Firstly, be prepared for the dress code; my girlfriend and I didn't notice the small print on the door. Having said this, and trust me, there is no reason to dress up. The owner is truly an old witch-on-wheels. To inform us of the code after we paid for dinner, was silly at best.  She seems unhappy with her life.  The food was just ok... portions small. The live music was entertaining, and dancing is encouraged.   No return dinner for us. Owner should stay home as well.  Ciao tutti"}
{"text":"For the price and atmosphere its good.. lets leave it at that. nothing will blow you away. Every time i have been its been dead so of course the service is good. There is one waiter who is pretty neurotic he literally runs everywhere for everything pretty amusing.. Lets face it its not expensive or over price by any means and the food is tasty. Done. Check it out if your into trying a new place every time like I normally am."}
{"text":"Food was inexpensive and good. NOW CLOSED! No wonder, I was there several times and service was always verrrry slow. Owner was rude and did not know anything about running his restaurant or dealing with people in general!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere with live Music every night featuring songs from Sinatra, Dean Martin and others. The food is absolutely Phenomenal with specialties like Steak pizziaola, Chicken Angelo, Veal Piccata, and A rack of lamb for 19.99 - they make their own balsamic vinaigrette that is mouthwatering and a clarified butter with herbs to dip warm bread into. An Additional benefit is that the owner and chef has made the kitchen conditions so that anyone with seafood allergies is safe because he has it set up so all seafood is cooked in a separate area of the kitchen and served on dishes with a different pattern. The prices are excellent for 4 of us with drinks and appetizers it was right about 100.00 and it is such a relaxing atmosphere."}
