{"text":"I have had the cupcakes and cookies numerous times. They are below average and taste like box cupcakes and the cookies are not memorable."}
{"text":"I have been going to Nona's on and off for years. We've followed her to all three locations. The treats were always tasty, until recently. This is the second time I've visited in the last two years. Both times were a complete disappointment. We ordered several items all were overly sweet with no flavor. The brownie cheesecake tasted like a cheap grocery store icing. The Napoleon was also hard and full of sugar. The cookie was okay. Its pretty disappointing that a full bakery can only make an okay tasting cookie."}
{"text":"The last time I visited Nona's was when they were at their North Tryon location and I would always stop in and have a cupcake from their cupcake bar. Well I decided to stop in yesterday  with my girlfriend for some desserts and try something new. My girlfriend ordered a red velvet cupcake with chocolate frosting and a Brownie cheesecake. I ordered an almond cupcake with caramel frosting and a Pumpkin cheesecake. The cupcakes were tasty but the cheesecake desserts were actually a layer of pumpkin pie/brownie, a layer of cream cheese frosting, a layer brownie/pumpkin pie and then another layer of the cream cheese frosting on top. There actually wasn't any \"cheesecake\" in there. That was a little disappointing because the cream cheese frosting was extremely sweet and I ended up just scraping it off. So I ended up just eating the pumpkin pie. We paid $5.50 a piece for the \"cheesecake\" desserts. That's $11.00 for pumpkin pie and a brownie. I could've made pumpkin pie and brownies for less than that at home. If you advertise pumpkin cheesecake and brownie cheesecakes, i expect to actually have a cheesecake and not just cream cheese frosting."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bakeries in Charlotte. For me it is the quintessence of what a bakery should be. It smells buttery and sweet when you walk through the door. I absolutely LOVE the cupcakes. They are moist, fresh, and flavorful.  I really like their signature Almond icing. I've also ordered a red velvet birthday cake from here. It was the highlight of the birthday party. It was delicious, beautiful and reasonably priced.  

I have to intentionally restrict myself from coming here weekly (I'd be as big as a house if I indulged every craving for this place :-) Lucky for me, the new location is not as convenient. Otherwise, I'd be in here a lot more. They have free wi-fi and a few lunch items that I plan to try soon (tomato and asiago soup), but I'm so addicted to the pastries I haven't tried anything else.

If you have a sweet tooth, this place should definitely be in your rotation."}
{"text":"The pastry and cafe dishes are delicious....I wish I knew of them when my daughter got married 2 yrs ago.  Love this place"}
{"text":"Always leave here with more sweets than I should, but they are so amazing I can't help it! My favorite are the rainbow cookies, so yummy and gorgeous looking! Right now I'm enjoying the turkey berry panini, delicious! Sweet, savory, and meaty! Nona herself bought it out to me and saw that I didn't pick up any napkins, and proceeded to give me some and say there you go sweetie, truly caring service! I love this place so much, the food and service are out of this world!"}
{"text":"I went inside the bakery to order my mother's birthday cake at 11:00am. My friend and I discuss cake options with the young man. We spent 30 min. narrowing things down n we decided on a sheet cake. It was perfect for what we wanted. Paid in full to have it by  September 22nd. I was not informed of the cancellation and refund policy. Had I known that I wouldn't attempt to cancel.  I call at 9:10 Monday morning to cancel due to my aunt already purchased a cake for my mothers birthday. The owner says she can only give me store credit. I don't need two cakes. There needs to be a cancellation window in case of emergencies!  

The cake shouldn't be in the process of being made."}
{"text":"I went there recently for some cookies because I'd heard it was a real good bakery.
The italian cookies were to die for... fresh, great flavor and just so authentic. As a yankee I am very happy we have Nona's to send me back in time. Delicious treats!!!"}
{"text":"Well, again a big disappointment. When you prefer Panera Bread over a real bakery it says all . Sorry."}
{"text":"I recently purchased a cake for a party and the taste was so horrible.
The cake is also bit expensive and less cake options to choose."}
{"text":"I went to a gathering and mentioned to the host that I also spent time making strawberry cupcakes last night for a kids party.  Ooops!!! She stated that she didn't make them.  I thought to myself that her cakes tasted just like the boxed ones I made the night before.  

I may come back and see what other types of items they have."}
{"text":"My experience here was fantastic! Even though they were in the middle of moving to a new location they continued to communicate with me via email in regards to my ordering my daughters cake. I visited them at their new location on their opening day and was very impressed when I walked in. It was very spacious and clean. As I walked  in I was greeted by a few people. As I looked around at their cake displays and treats I got a really good feeling about the cake I had ordered. It definitely looks as though they have great talent for decorating. They have so many cookies, pastries, cupcakes, pies and cakes to choose from that I couldn't wrap my head around what to purchase to take home with me. I had only gone in to speak with Dominica about the final details of the cake I had ordered but found myself needing to purchase some yummy treats. I ended up getting cannolis, napoleons and eclairs. OH MY GOODNESS, OH MY GOODNESS! That's all I can say about those.  Some of the most delicious pastries I have ever tasted. And they are HUGE! I've eaten at some top bakeries/cafes in Los Angeles and this bakery is right up there with those. 

I am very excited to take my husband there to eat some items off of their cafe menu. I pick up my daughter's cake in a few days and I can't wait! I

I am updating my review because I just had my daughter's birthday party yesterday and the cake review is in! Upon picking the cake up I was very pleased with the appearance of the cake. They did a stellar job decorating. Once it was time to cut the cake and nosh I was a bit disappointed. Although the cake itself was moist and delicious, the raspberry filling was not something to be desired. All it really is is raspberry jelly donut filling...blech! I decided to look past that but then I cut the mini cake that sat on top of the main cake and was upset to find out that it was not lemon as I had requested it to be. I asked for their signature almond buttercream on the main cake and mini cake that sat on top but it was vanilla buttercream. Them when my daughter dug into her smash cake i noticed it wasn't as white as the vanilla cake so I tasted it and it was lemon with almond buttercream. I asked for her cake to be vanilla with whipped icing. They messed up the order a bit even though I had emailed Dominica several times and went into the bakery to speak with her directly. I even took the time to write down everything as I wanted it to be so there would be no room for error. I watched her write it down on the order form and it still got messed up. Oh well.

This bakery is pretty pricey even for my standards and that is why I got upset about the mixup and raspberry filling.  Although I am impressed with their decorating skills and pastries I do believe that some of their ingredients could be of a higher quality. I still give them four stars overall."}
{"text":"Nona's almond flavor cupcake and almond flavor icing is my go to when I have a sweet tooth!! The icing is very sweet (just the way it should be!) with incredible flavor. I've stopped in often since they opened at their first location. The cupcakes never disappoint. The only thing I would change are the hours...pretty please be open a bit later for people who want a cupcake after dinner :)"}
{"text":"Nona's did our wedding cake and it was so beautiful, elegant, and delicious. The process was easy, even though we had no idea what we were doing or what we wanted. Dominique led us through every step to help up get the cake perfect for us. 

Thank you all so much!!!!"}
{"text":"We love Nona's! Not only are the desserts awesome but the breakfast and lunch is fantastic as well. I love the huge breakfast burrito. My boyfriend said the spicy breakfast sandwich on the croissant is the best breakfast sandwich he's ever had. Definitely recommend stopping by! The staff is always awesome and welcoming too."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed! It tasted like Box cupcakes except they were dry. Very tasteless. I was extremely disappointed. I purchased red velvet, strawberry, and chocolate. Even the icing is nothing special. Will never go back."}
{"text":"They offer nice fresh bakery items including an assortment of cookies that remind me of some of my favorite childhood bakery treats.

In particular,  as a kid I loved the little buttery sandwich cookie shaped like a leaf that comes in pink ( sort of cherry flavored) and green (not sure of the flavor of that one) with some chocolate... yum- I haven't had cookies like those in years! Nona's does them well.

Some of their selections are less sweet... definitely a more European type sweet -like their spumoni cookies.  

If you like European bakery treats, you should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Convenient location off WT Harris Blvd between I-85 and I-77. Always quick friendly service and wide selection of yummy treats! I like that you can pick your own cupcake and have them add the icing of your choice with lots of toppings to choose from. I also love their fudge and the butter pecan fudge is a favorite. Expensive but delicious! Small 3\" square was a little over $4.  So if you don't mind paying a premium for quality food and excellent customer service, go check them out!"}
{"text":"They need to stop calling them as a \"bakery\" and change it to Nona General Food store. Over the last few years, i have tried to give them another chance, but they never fail to disappoint me. Some of nearby grocery stores with a decent bakery sections have much better deserts and sweet goodies. Nona's sweets are not fresh, at times, things are drier than gas-station snacks. On top of that, they do not even have any special variety that would make them stand out as a specialty bakery. In addition, it is over-priced. I am giving them one star rating since yelp does not allow to post without a star"}
{"text":"Pastries...FABULOUS!
Cakes, cookies, specialty items...all simply wonderful!
Coffee...eh. It can be hot first thing in the morning but by 9, lukewarm at best. 
Breakfast...what's just above eh? Microwaved eggs with bacon bits and cheese in a styrofoam cup were just not what I wanted. And I had asked for my eggs to be a little wet and was told they could not do that because BY LAW they had to cook eggs dry but that the cheese would help it be the way I wanted it. 

Wait. What? I lived in Charlotte for 25 years. Never, not ONCE, did I hear of an \"egg cooked to death\" law being put in place. I think it is more along the lines of someone only knowing how to push a certain button on the microwave. If I had understood this 7$ item was microwaved eggs...I think I'd have just had coffee and left it at that."}
{"text":"Cannoli (no s at the end - cannoli is plural).  Made from scratch, filling and pastry.  Not imported, pre-made, frozen.  That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. I am from Ny and heard these were authentic Italian pastries. The only item fresh and tasty was the Neapolitan. The eclair was stale as well as the tri colored cookies. Lemon bars had not much flavor and cannoli was ok. Spent $27 on these pastries Saturday for a dinner party and was embarrassed and disappointed"}
{"text":"Great service. I went in to do a taste testing for my wedding cake and they did great with communicating and understanding what we were wanting and finding ways to make it work. I enjoyed and had fun !! Thanks nonas can't wait to taste the cake. I recommend the strawberry that was my favorite."}
{"text":"I love this bakery!!! Almond frosting yes please and more of it!!  Staff is always helpful and friendly.  Special order cakes can be pricey yet to me it's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"This is the Very Best. I like most bakeries but I am a cannoli freak.  They are sooo good, and all those little cookie things I try a sample of all. A must try like for real"}
{"text":"I had pancakes! Don't bother with IHOP. Two pancakes were more than enough and served with a turkey sausage and fresh fruit. Excellent!
Service was optimal."}
{"text":"Nona Nona where have you been all my life? In the basement? the attic? I know the kitchen baking those mouth watering bites of... well you know ... those things Dr Oz tells you not to eat because, they are not on his list. Sure not a green leafy veg in the house . But Nona who the H*** needs green leafy veg when you have these delights from Nona's? If I die bury me with a cup cake...Lots of icing please.."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab some treats for a client meeting.  There was only one other customer at 1pm, which is surprising since they do offer lunch, but we were able to get in and out quickly.  We got one of each of their cookies and truffles and the whole box was only $12 and that included a hot tea for me!  I snagged an almond  biscotti and it was really good."}
{"text":"I got a brownie cheesecake. Delish... son got the red velvet cheesecake.. just as good. Have not tried anything else cause i get the samething everytime. I guess im a creature of habbit."}
{"text":"Completely satisfied with the dozen assorted pastries for a customer except that the young man sealed up the box so I couldn't snatch one before I got them To my customer . I didn't try them
But they look pled sinful and a gray assortment.  Turns out that this
Location is pretty close to my hotel.  I'll remember this on my sales rotation in Charlotte.

This trip I got another dozen for a customer and Joseph always takes good care of me"}
{"text":"Beautiful creations that taste as good as they look.  The owners really care about their craft and make it a very pleasurable experience.

Top Notch"}
{"text":"Cake was dry and the frosting tasted cheap. $66 for a cake with a plastic graduation cap and plastic diploma with a ribbon around the bottom. Zero artistic ability. I've paid cheaper for better tasting cakes with better hand decorations. Will never order from here again (my husband ordered this cake and didn't shop around, lesson learned) and do NOT recommend. Much better bakeries in Charlotte. Publix has a better bakery than this place."}
{"text":"I soooo wish this was closer to home. My wife has been looking, in vain up till now, for a quality Italian bakery. Bingo, Nona's duplicates the tastes and treats that are reminiscent of our trips to Chicago's Little Italy. We bought 2 of each cookie and 4 of those we knew from memory. WOW!"}
{"text":"Nonas bakery has been around for quite some time.  They recently moved from the location on N. Tryon to the existing location in Worthington Shoppes off Harris Blvd near Red Robin.  I go here for my Italian cookie fix because they are good and reasonably priced compared to the few I places I have seen that carry them in the Charlotte metro.  They carry sprinkle cookies, strawberry and pistachio leaf, anise, rainbow cookies yum!  Everything is baked fresh in house.  They also make fresh cannolis as well.  the other cakes and baked goods look delicious, they often put out samples of the cakes.  They also make breakfast and lunch now and use boars head meats!  Yayyy"}
{"text":"A solid four star establishment.
The food was unique and tasty. I had the red velvet waffle and a Papa's scramble bowl. Both were good though the Scramble bowl is very reminiscent of Waffle House (if Waffle House got really creative one day). The Scramble Bowl had eggs, bacon and cheese mixed into a cup. It was tasty, but obviously was a pretty heavy meal.
The Red Velvet Waffle comes with a meat of your choice and the Waffle itself was perfect. The Red Velvet flavor really comes through with some confectioners sugar sprinkled on top. Both items were reasonably priced (under $7).
The ambiance was interesting. It was a little noisy but it is clear these were all people that worked or lived in the area. This included a group of older ladies in the back playing cards (too funny). The noise level wasn't bad and the seating arrangement really helped with that. However I would say that the seating is a little odd, some tables even had mismatched chairs. The arrangement isn't  bad but it is unusual for a cafe. The music that plays in the background is classic, and at a perfect decibel where you can hear it but don't have to talk over it.
Overall I recommend this cafe for people looking for some unusual breakfast options at a very affordable price. Oh and they do not really know how to steep tea, but I didn't hold that against them since very few places steep tea correctly."}
{"text":"Let's be honest...I have a sweet tooth .... ALL the time! Since moving to Charlotte, I have heard so many wonderful things about this place, so I wanted to try it out for myself. As soon as I entered, I was helped by a nice staff member.  He didn't hound me and let me take my time as I decided what I wanted from this wonderful display of sugary yumminess.  The staff was so patient and helpful and even went in the back to get me some samples to try. I bought some cupcakes that LITERALLY melted in my mouth - the softness and moistness of the cupcake was DIVINE!!! I recommend the cupcakes to everyone and the fun part is that they have a cupcake bar where you choose your cake and your frosting based on the flavors of the day ( EVERYTHING is baked fresh daily and you can tell). A hit with my tummy! Must try :)"}
{"text":"Third time here, last time for sure. Sorry, I've spent over $100 there. I tried the cake the first time and not only was it expensive and dry but the frosting was too sweet. Second time I just went with cookies and cupcakes. Not good!!!!!! Then finally today I went to see if they could make a decent donut. Not only were they dry and poorly made, they were expensive. The kids asked me why I didn't go to Dunkin donuts. Smh I idk. I paid $2 each for some stale donuts that must have sat for a couple days."}
{"text":"Dominica was great!!! Went for our tasting today. The assortments was cleverly displayed. The cake was so moist!! Was so fun to mix and match flavored. Am very excited for the big day!
Had lunch after and was amazing!! Cheesy chicken BLT is a new favorite!!"}
{"text":"i purchase a cake today for my for my friends birthday a marble cake with birthday decoration on the top. I was extremely  disappointed. First This was definitely a BOX CAKE.  Nothing about this cake scream that  got it from a well know bakery. it taste ver similar to Sam's club cakes.  The cakes are over price for the quality and the decoration seem like a child wrote his name on the cake. this is my third time trying them and i must  say this is the last."}
{"text":"I used Nona's for my wedding cake. They were easy to meet with and plan for the cake I was interested in. I did request fruit to be a main part of the cake decor and it was included in the order form. However, I was not contacted nor did I contact them to check in and confirm the fruit before the wedding so there was no fruit on the cake. Lesson learned - always confirm order a week or two before an event! Though it would have left a great impression if they contacted me. The cake was delicious either way."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quiet breakfast....Really! Croissants, quiche, French toast and all their coffees and teas are high end. 
Papa's Kickin' Croissant and a Kilimanjaro coffee is the best way to start the day.
They have a good lunch sammy selection. And then there's the truffles, cookies and sweets.
The best part, these are nice folks that work hard making the best food and deserts."}
{"text":"I visited this location on a Friday afternoon. It was not busy so I was waited on right away. The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and willing to help with a smile. 

The cake was really delicious and the cannolis were one of the best that I have ever had. Take it from me, I'm Italian."}
{"text":"I recently ordered a birthday cake from Nona's for my mother.  I originally emailed Nona's and then followed up with a call in order to ensure the correctness of my order (I don't live in Charlotte so I couldn't go to the bakery personally).  My friend picked up the cake for me on the agreed upon ready date, and sent me a picture of it.  I was immediately unhappy with it and told her to go back inside and talk to someone about fixing it.  The cake was supposed to be very similar to a picture that I sent them, which it was, but they skimped on the design.  When I had placed the order I discussed the design in detail with the employee, and she was also looking at the picture I sent, so she was clear on what I wanted.  My friend went back inside Nona's and was able to get the design fixed to my standard.  I thought the cake was fine until we cut it at my mom's birthday dinner.  I specifically ordered a carrot cake with NO nuts...and guess what....the cake had nuts in it!  Overall, the flavor (minus the nuts that we had to pick through/dig out) and final presentation of the cake were excellent, but it should not have had nuts in it, and it should have been decorated correctly from the start.  I contacted Nona's and they were very responsive and offered a refund of about 40% off the cake.

I'm writing this review to let you all know that when ordering a cake from Nona's, be VERY specific about what you want and it would probably help to call in the days leading up to your pickup date to ensure they got your order right."}
{"text":"Nona's is consistently good and a great staff.  I get the breakfast burrito for breakfast and sandwiches at lunch.  Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't because of reasonably- priced Boar's Head lunches, this bakery/cafe would get 1 star. Everything looks pretty but these are the facts: staff, not so friendly (except for the lady in the funny white hat); and MOSTLY because the CANOLI are SO OVERPRICED ... go to Fresh market, half the price and 10 times as good. My shells fell apart in my hands and if that's ricotta, I'll be a monkeydog. I don't know what the filing is but it is TERRIBLE. Canoli is a primary food group for me. I would know. Mostly because staff is so unenthused ... won't be going back. Hire staff that enjoy and are eager to see the customers please."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and the service was not impressive considering we were the only two people in the place. They do serve Boar's Head meats so the sandwiches we ordered were delicious.

It looks like they do a brisk business on pastries and cakes. They look delicious but didn't try any this trip."}
{"text":"Went in for some cookies came out with an original roast beef. It was on ciabatta bread and had the following: roast beef; red onion; horse radish; lettuce and mayo. It was fabulous! Came with chips or fruit.  I got two sugar cookies and two choco chip cookies.  Super yummy!! The guy that took my order was nice.  It wasn't too busy and i was in and out quickly.  Will go back for lunch for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious desserts at an affordable price! The cake designs are unlimited! I bought a Tuxedo cake with almond icing for my daughter's birthday. I also asked for cannolis to go but couldn't wait so I had them put them on a tray to eat while I was there! Ha ha The Staff was very friendly, professional and knowledgeable! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got some cupcakes here and they were ok. The cupcake itself was dry and their passion fruit one tasted like strawberry so I don't know if they gave us the wrong one but it tasted nothing like passion fruit. The icing was too sweet. It was not horrible but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I had just driven by the old location when my daughter shouted out, \"the bakery is closed.\"  That led me to stop by the new location off Harris Boulevard on my way North.  When I walked in right after lunch, I was not immediately hit by the smell of baked goods.  Don't get me wrong, there were many goodies on display, available for sale (see photos) and the cafe was open and available for lunch.  I looked around and grabbed a couple goodies for the family.  Service was great and a smile makes all well.  Prices on some items were acceptable (in my humble opinion) while others I thought were too much to pay for that particular item.  If it is a little cake for one, for two, or for more, Nona's is worth a trip."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy stopping into this place for my pregnancy crave while visiting Charlotte. I must say I was surprised by the reviews because my experience was a good one. I ordered a slice of vanilla cake and a strawberry cupcake. The cake slice reminded me of my moms traditional Haitian cake so I was thrilled!! The cupcake came with no icing at first, which puzzled me. But then I found out that's because they will ice it with the icing of your choice. Talk about options!!! Both were decadent treats for me and the baby. 

Pros: Yummy Good, Location, Service was effective, Friendliness, You can try all the icing flavors

Cons: A little overpriced"}
