{"text":"We were looking for a place to do dinner before seeing a show at Second City, and the Yelp reviews led us here.   It was my first night in Toronto, so don't know how it compares in the area, but the food was good and the service was fantastic. They easily accommodated us when we had a late arrival to our party - they had a glass of wine and her entree in less than 5 minutes!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a group of 11.  The table we sat at was too small (technically fit everyone but was crammed!) even though we made reservations.  When we enquired about the upstairs we were told it was a private room.  Our service was ok, but we had to ask a few times to get the waiter to take drink orders.    The food was exactly what another reviewer said - similar to Spring Rolls (which isn't anything fabulous).  Overall, I would say it's an ok place but I will probably not return."}
{"text":"Although the food was generally decent, we ordered fried rice and spring rolls, the service and related attitude was atrocious. I will not go again. The server (seemingly also the bartender) came over in a huff, got our drinks order wrong, yelled at me while I was ordering and pulled the menus away / walked away in a huff before we could complete the order. It served to ruin our collective moods for the evening."}
{"text":"Awesome place in the heart of the city!  Went here with a group of co-workers for dinner, it was our first time, and didn't have any real expectations.  The service is quick, friendly and ready to help, we ordered lots of drinks, and even got a few on the house!  For appetizers we all had spring rolls .. and honestly was the best spring rolls I have ever had!  All the food at dazzling looked amazing and the flavours were just perfect!  The restaurant gets fairly busy and attracts a pretty hip and happening crowd!  I Recommend everything on the menu and plan on coming back again!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some good unconventional asian-style food in downtown Toronto but don't want to blow money as if you were celebrating your selection into the Raptors' squad (we all know they could use some fresh hands and legs), then Dazzling Modern Restaurant/Bar is a good place to check out.  The FOOD!: - good variety - decent list of wines / other drinks - REALLY good quantity (and I speak as a semi-perennially hungry, 23-year old guy) - We had the chicken spring rolls, Thai Panang Noodles & Thai Panang Curry == I loved the taste for the price I paid. I highly recommend either the Thai Panang Noodles or the curry.  - Food rating: 5/5  And the PRICE: - pretty economic - For one main entre, one appetizer and one drink (I got the sake), you're looking at about $25-$30. For a comfortable downtown location, that's pretty good.  - Price rating: 5/5  Decor: - Comfortable seating; spacious enough - moderately sized place, so it's good to call before you go - Good decor (we went at night, the lighting sets a good ambience) - They have some flat-screens as well with a bar - Decor rating: 5/5 in general. But since it won't accommodate larger groups, I'll dock a star for that == 4/5.   Service: - very polite - took time to explain some dishes I wasn't too sure about - prompt service to other requests even when it got pretty busy and almost all tables were occupied - Service rating: 5/5  Other: - they have some space on the 2nd floor as well; there was a performance on the day we went, so didn't get a chance to check it out.  - So for people who are looking to throw a party, this could be an option.  Why to go there: - Not very expensive; good food for the price - Good decor, good service - Not very loud, but not very quiet either - pleasantly upbeat - May get a seat right next to the window facing King St. I'm a fan of enjoying the city's view at night. - Might be a good place to go with a friend or your significant other - For a first date = aah, that's a tough one... I think you would want to check it out yourself before you put your eggs in this basket.   Why not to go there: - Moderately sized = may not be ideal for large groups  All in all, if you're looking for a place to go get some good food and enjoy it in an upbeat ambience with good service, this is a good choice. Like I said, it's moderately sized, so call ahead."}
{"text":"Ugh, unimpressed.  You'd think, right, that if a place displays rows of flavored vodkas impressively lit up behind the bar that you'd be able to order a drink made with one of them?  Yeah, not here.  We also only got one menu to share (it certainly wasn't busy--they had plenty when I went to get more from the hostess station!) and had to explicitly ask for chopsticks and teacups.  The place certainly is pretty, but I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"Searching for an Asain restaurant that isn't Manchu Wok or Thai express in Financial District for lunch, turned up this gem. My boyfriend and I came for lunch yesterday and were pleasantly surprised at our \"lunch on a whim, hope this place isn't crap\" choice. Arrived at 1:30 and we were the opnly ones in there. I'm sure if we went at 12 or 12:30 it would have been busier. We ordered the lunch special. I had the vegatable spring rolls and Kung pao chicken and rice with salad. My boyfriend ordered the miso soup and some shrimp beef rice thingy and salad. Our bill came to $22 which was great, considering we had a hot, sit down lunch, our portions were massive (we both had to bring the rest with us) and the food was brought over to us really quick (from the minute we came in to the minute we left, it took 45 minutes). Our waiter was super nice and filled our glasses with water before we even had a chance to ask. Can't wait to come back for dinner and experience the bar!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!  the service was terrific, waiters were all very very friendly  food, AMAZING my bf and I got pad thai ( they have 4 types! i got curry, he got tomato base) they also give u more shrimp in the house pad thai than most places will!  inside is BEAUTIFUL!   over all , pretty much a perfect experience"}
{"text":"Also, um das gleich mal klar zu stellen: Ich liebe Toronto.  Aber trotzdem wäre es mir lieber, wenn das Dazzling modern restaurant + bar nicht in Toronto sondern mehr in der Gegend, in der ich mich normaler Weise aufhalte, angesiedelt wäre.    Das Restaurant habe ich eigentlich nur durch Zufall gefunden. Mit Freunden bin ich durch Toronto geschlendert und wir haben langsam angefangen uns nach etwas passendem zum Abendessen umzusehen. In einer Gegend, in der ein Italiener neben dem nächsten steht, hat uns der schicke Asiate sofort neugierig gemacht.    Wir haben Fisch probiert und zwei verschiedene Curries, davon gibt es vier auf der Karte: Mild, mittel, scharf und mit Kokosmilch. Eigentlich wollten wir mild und scharf bestellen, der Kellner hat uns dann aber auf mild und mittel heruntergehandelt  und das war auch gut so! Selbst relativ schärferesistente Europäer können auch vom mittelscharfen Curry in rauschähnliche Zustände versetzt werden :D    Geschmeckt hat das Essen jedenfalls klasse und frisch und reichlich war es auch. Eigentlich hätte ich gern noch eine Nachspeise gegessen, aber dafür war kein Platz mehr.    Der Service war schnell und freundlich, die Musik war angenehm und nicht zu laut und die Amosphäre war auch sehr angenehm. Super ist, dass die Glasfront an Sommerabenden offen bleibt und man an den vorderen Tischen zwar unterdacht aber trotzdem direkt an der frischen Luft sitzt."}
{"text":"I've been to Dazzling a few times, but each time I'm becoming less and less enamoured with it.  There are a few dishes which are really good, such as the salted pepper calamari and the shrimp dumplings. Two dishes that are easy to get wrong, and they do them well. I'm also a fan of the panang pad thai - just the right amount of curry to give a good twist to an old favourite - I order it most times I go.  The waitstaff leave a little to be desired though. The friendliest and most helpful person there was the girl standing outside on the street. Once you get inside, there wasn't a lot of love for the customers. My wine took forever to come, even my appetiser came first. I ordered my pad thai without egg due to an allergy, and only realised after eating most of it that they'd gotten the order wrong (and clearly hadn't mixed the pad thai very well if all the egg was at the bottom of the plate). Not a happy camper.  But the worst thing I found? The wine list included a bottle of \"Australian sparkling wine\" called Pink Passion Pop. Back in Australia, this is absolutely the worst sparkling wine you can buy, and is actually targeted at teenage girls who just want something sweet to get them drunk. You can buy it in the bottle stores back in Australia for less than C$5, which goes to show you the quality. The price on Dazzling's menu? C$45. Plus tax. An obscene markup on a disgusting wine that should never be on any wine list of a restaurant trying to be classier than KFC. And it's on this basis alone that I will not be going back, and I dropped the rating to 2 (based on everything else I would have given a 3). And to be perfectly honest, with the number of Aussie ex-pats living in Toronto, I'm surprised this hasn't come up before now."}
{"text":"Dazzling? Anything but. Visit Dazzling if you want tasteless, medicore food served at a snail's pace.   The restaurant was nearly empty and we ordered just three items. Somehow, this order took 45 minutes to fill.  The Salmon Rose was tiny and expensive, which would be find if it wasn't totally bland - it was literally devoid of flavor.  I ordered a noodle dish and requested no mushrooms. They sent my dish out with Chinese mushrooms. When I complained, they insisted Chinese mushrooms were not mushrooms.   My partner ordered salmon with vegetables. The salmon was good but tiny, and the rice was sent on a separate plate, which we thought was very weird. The mixed vegetables were quite plain. They were only seasoned with a bit of black pepper. Worst of all, they came to the table cold."}
{"text":"Been going here since the place opened 4 years ago.  Every time I go, the food is outstanding and the people are really nice.   Only once, I went late and I guess they wanted to open a club and the music permeated the restaurant and it was too loud.  But that was years ago and I've never experienced that since.    Everyone I have brought there has always been impressed with the food.  Really it is so good.  Every dish, every time.  I even took leftovers to a friend once and she loved it.  A staple resto for me.  I will always return."}
{"text":"Went to Dazzling only once with my co-workers and we had to wait more than one hour to get our food which is a big deal when you have one lunch breaks ... even though the food quality was good I won't go back to Dazzling ... there are better places in this neighborhood catering to the so called \"lunch crowd\""}
{"text":"Super Suhsi, absolute Topqualitaet."}
{"text":"No, comrades, not. Very rude waiters. Sent me to the washrooms in the basement to drop a cleanex. Washrooms smell of eeky desinfection. Large loud annoying TV screens. Singapore sling with absent gin. Noodle soup with disgusting instant noodles. Not again. I will be going to Cantine at the TIFF, just opposite and very nice."}
{"text":"Like another entry - my bf and I just found this place by accident as we were looking for somewhere to eat on King Street. It looks like a fairly new restaurant, decorated nicely. They have a patio but we opted to stay inside but near the front. At first they weren't keen on giving us the front seat because it sat four people, and there was another group of four waiting. But since we had asked for it first, they made it work for us (oh my, as I write that I realize I sound like such a brat!  but it was such a nice day!). So that was the first plus!  The other great thing was that they had a pretty great value three course menu for $19.99. I got a really tasty mango salad - highly recommend it. The dressing was really tasty and sweet. My main course was the pineapple fried rice, which they made vegetarian for me and it was delicious!  My bf's dish wasn't as good but overall we were happy with the food. The dessert (Lemon square) however wasn't amazing, a bit weak."}
{"text":"Went here last night looking for some good asian food.  Mistake.  Obviously the cook doesn't know what he/she is doing.  The mango beef was horrible.  The beef was soggy, the sauce was a mix between sweet and gross.  I ate maybe three bites.  Oh, on top of that, I got charged two dollars for steamed rice...it was not good rice either.  It was the cheap kind.  Had a avocado salad that started off pretty good, but the closer i got to the bottom of the bowl, the worse it tasted.  They poured some type of sugar water in there.  Whomever is cooking back there does not know how to mix different tastes, sweets and sours, etc.   This place is amateur hour."}
{"text":"I went here last week before going to a musical. The place is modernly decorated, quite a nice atmosphere.  We got appetizers - Gyoza and Veggie Futomaki. Both were quite yummy. I ordered orange creamsicle for my drink, it was good too, would've liked it even more if it was blended and not just poured over ice. I ordered basil beef as my main dish, it was quite delicious. Overall experience I would say is this place is good, nothing to complain about, but nothing really stood out for me either to make me have to go back again."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was my friends' company and the random guys we chatted with at the next table. I love love love Thai food and most Asian cuisine in general. I was in Toronto for Caribana and this strip on King St seemed to be the most packed with dining options. The night before my friend and I had amazing Indian food (review to come) so Saturday night we decided to try this place - Dazzling. The good: I had a spicy tuna roll to start... it was good, no complaints. I wasn't too hungry or blown away by the menu in general so I kept it simple and got Seafood Thai Fried Rice. It was fine... again, nothing spectacular and once I put Srirachi on it I was good to go. My friend ordered Basil Chicken... it didn't come with any rice! WTH... this isn't an Indian spot... how was she supposed to eat the sauce and all that without any rice. Bogus. My other friend also kept it simple and ordered Pad Thai. We thought something was up when the menu gave options as to what sauce to put on it... I've never in my life seen that. Pad Thai doesn't come with sauce poured over it. We were confused so when she ordered she just said Pad Thai... our server didn't ask any follow up questions so we thought that was good enough. When her food came it looked pretty plain and dry. She said it tasted worse than it looked. She asked the server for extra sauce or something to put on it because it had no flavor and just tasted like cooked noodles. His response: \"It's just ketchup... you want ketchup?\" Again, WTH! We realized that he meant tomato sauce but really? If that's the description you give to customers, you know the cooking is not that involved. Blown. He brings her some Srirachi... no, sir, adding hot sauce to plain noodles is not that business. So then he brings her peanut sauce (like for Chicken Satay - which she had as her appetizer). She tried but the food was not coming together and she was pissed. At the end of the day, the manager said she couldn't order anything else instead even though her food was not edible. How ridiculous. She had to negotiate with him for it to be at least half off... and even that was a struggle. She probably only ate 2 small bites of it before pushing it to the side, wasting her $7 (half the full cost) and eating some of my fried rice. I have no idea where the positive reviews are coming from for this place. It was disappointing. My food wasn't bad but the service was outrageous. The manager was friendly and joking in the beginning of our stay but once the food came and things went sideways he was a jerk. He stood over our table at the end of the meal as we were paying and when we politely said we'd need a minute he just said ok and stood there. So then we asked him for more water, so he'd walk away out of our personal space but still he just said ok and stood there. Jerk. His demeanor was straight up like he didn't think we would pay or something. No lie, I wish I had Indian two nights in a row because we left that restaurant stuffed and happy! And it was only a few doors down! But now I know and hopefully you readers also now know to stay away from this not so Dazzling restaurant."}
{"text":"Contrary to its appearances, Dazzling is extremely affordable-- I was able to have a filling lunch for $6 before taxes. The atmosphere is terrific, and the service was helpful and friendly-- we were also able to book for 16 people at very short notice, no small feat. There was a mixup with one of our orders-- my friend ordered a pad thai and received some fried rice, but they quickly delivered the proper dish and we were able to keep the fried rice, too!  However, as Chris N. attests, the food is nothing special. The fried rice I ordered was acceptable and nice for the price, but completely unmemorable. Dazzling has its price, atmosphere and service going for them, but if you're looking for amazing asian food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"OMG... this place is AWESOME!!!!   Two days of business in Toronto... my job, to pick the restaurants for dinner (among the real work ;).   yelp Toronto to the rescue... We wanted to go into the entertainment district and get away from Markham our last night. I was laughing when I pulled up restaurants choices, Chinese, Dim Sum, Thai, Asian, Asian Fusion, Japanese, Sushi, Italian/Asian Fusion??? ... did I mention Asian? About 7 or 8 times ;p  Anyway, this place intrigued me with all the fab reviews and interesting menu.   They have an ultra modern groovy decor which makes me feel trendier than I am. We were greeted by a poor gal that had to wear a parka out front in the gale force winds of June??  We actually walked right by her (the parka threw us off ;)  Anyway, the staff was friendly and attentive, we never had to search them out. The food AMAZING!! There were enough options to make any taste happy. Between the 4 of us: 3 appetizers, 2 sushi entrees, 1 stir fry, 1 pad Thai, 2 bottles of wine $151.... very cool, Parking on King Street (once we figured out HOW to use the meter) $10. The experience of singing happy birthday to a colleague, laughing and bonding with work friends I never see (because we live in different cities)... PRICELESS! ... For every thing else, there's credit cards.   Thanks Dazzling modern restaurant + bar for providing us a great atmosphere for fun.   Thanks Toronto yelpers for your reviews... it made my job easy to find some very cool places!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out in early April 2010.  Absolutely LOVE the Dazzling Roll with eel, tuna, mackerel(?), and tempura flakes.  The taste of the sushi is fresh and delicious, and you just can't get enough of it.  We also love their Thai rolls made for dipping.  Going back to sample the rest of the menu soon."}
{"text":"I came in here for dinner with a group of around 6 and the only reason we chose Dazzling was because we already had a pricey night planned and were looking for a nearby cheap restaurant and Dazzling ended up being that option. By cheap I mean it's probably the cheapest food you can get in this block. It's a far cry from some of it's neighbours and is not as trendy as it wants to be.   It was more or less empty when we walked in, nothing special going on inside of it, service was friendly and quick, there is nothing to note that makes Dazzling stand out but their food is good enough and they have a good sized menu.   I would recommend Dazzling if you want decent food at a reasonable pricce, but not if you want a fancy night out on King Street."}
{"text":"I discovered Dazzling by accident, we were on our way to another restaurant and happened to drive by Dazzling, for some reason it caught our eye and we decided to ditch the other place and give this a try.   First off, might I just say the best sushi in Toronto, sure its not Sushi on Bloor price wise, but the rolls are worth it.   The decor is romantic and the service is great, the kind that I like still doing their job while not being in your face trying to fill up your glass after every sip you take.   We also ordered from their main dishes and were also very satisfied. It's definitely a place to take your S.O."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, although on the pricier side. I've had their tuna and salmon sushi and their fried rice; their both staples that I would get again and again.  I will say that I'm more often here for their Thursday night party, Sake & Soul. It's a great night to hear some live R&B and then dance the night away upstairs to some good DJs. The upstairs space is kinda small, but on a regular night, it can be a great party."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place.  Very fresh fish.  Sashimi was excellent.  First experience in Toronto and while expectations were low, fish was outstanding.  Great service.  Scott"}
{"text":"We were walking down the street that seemed filled with Italian restaurants, when we came across this place.  The hostess outside showed us the menu & even gave us some suggestions -- sold.  The decor is pretty simple -- white linens, comfy leather seats & red light boxes surrounding.  The food was delicious & tasted very fresh.  I had the Cantonese fried noodle dish & hubby had some sort of curry dish.  My dish hit the spot -- there wasn't an overabundant amount of food, so while I was full, it did not get to the \"food coma\" level.    Overall, it was a relaxing experience & would suggest it to others."}
{"text":"Think of Spring Rolls. Now think of a better version of Spring Rolls and just like that, poof, Dazzling! Dazzling is a modern Asian Fusion restaurant. They have cuisine from every Asian country under the sun. Thai, Viet, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, some Malay.  My gf and I came in after a Salsa class. We sure worked up an appetite. They had a prix fixe deal that I found interesting. Appetizer, entree, dessert for 23 bucks. The selection was adequate.   Choices ranged from a Japanese sushi entree to Thai noodles. We chose the spring rolls to start, seafood fried rice and Crème brûlée to finish. We also ordered a sushi roll on the side. I forgot the name of it, but instead of the regular nori seaweed, it had a red rice flour wrapping. Inside, scallop, tuna and some veg. My gf and I thought this roll was one of the best sushi rolls we had ever experienced. The flavors were different but not too much to be unfamiliar. The wrapping gave it more of a fresh spring roll feel rather than a sushi roll, just delicious. The portion was very small, 4 pieces for around 11 bucks but it's really good.  The spring rolls we ordered were also very good. In comparison to the countless spring rolls I've eaten before, these were much better. The filling was vegetarian, but it came out fresh out of the fryer, hot and crispy.   The seafood fried rice was a mound of delicious seafood flavour. Shrimp, squid, scallop, and a few mussels, it was all there. Typical fried rice but enough to feed 2.  Last, the Crème brûlée was a wreck. The worst I've eaten. The consistency was way off. Past the sugar crust was a flan like pudding which was scrambled in texture. Not smooth, silky and creamy as every dessert called a Crème brûlée ought to be. My gf is a Crème brûlée monster, she was ultra disappointed and upset with terrible ending to a decent meal.  The service is good, menu is well selected and the options are not limiting. The food on the most part was good. The prices are a bit more expensive, but expected for the area and location. Dessert killed our 4 star visit to a 3."}
{"text":"Order: Vietnamese Delight Paper Rolls, Panang Curry w/Chicken, Malaysia Style Paste Fried Noodles, Fuzzy Martini, Pear Martini  Being one of the only asian restaurants on its strip, there wasn't any competition too pull us elsewhere.  The hostess out front was also friendly and eager to show u the menus and highlight their best dishes.  Immediately upon entering, the restaurant gives off a very chic, young, club-like vibe.  The asian fusion theme is plastered everywhere as well with bright reds and imagery of cherry blossoms.  As far as atmosphere goes, this place gets a thumbs up.  The service was pretty on spot and helpful too.  But too bad my review isn't solely based on that.  The head chef here is from Malaysia so I would assume the Malaysian-infused foods here would be the best and safest picks off their menu.  And because of that we ordered the malaysian noodles, hoping to be dazzled.  However the flavor was somewhat lacking and for whatever reason, all you could really taste were the noodles.  I was disappointed, but at the least, the curry was pretty good.  I like to ask what the popular items or the chef's picks are when I order, and always find it disappointing when the dish comes out lack luster.  And that was the main reason for the 3-star rating I'm giving it.  [Pros] + very young, high energy type atmosphere - yet quiet enough that you don't have to yell or talk over background music + great service from waiters and servers + presentation of food was great  [Cons] - didn't find the food to be as amazing as everything else  [Side Notes] * wednesdays are $4.50 Martini nights * reservations can be made on the 2nd floor for more intimate, private meetings/meals"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. I wasn't impressed. It felt like another version of Spring Rolls (of which I'm not a big fan of either). The decor was pretty and modern. It was a nice setting. Service was okay - it wasn't that great but I'm not sure if it was because we had about 15 people in our party.  We had to servers for our party. As I was at the end of the table closer to the kitchen, I got my food first. The birthday girl who sat 2 seats over from me had to wait 10 minutes before her food came! The people at the far end had to wait another 10 minutes after the birthday girl got her food!   Our drinks were tasty. The same cannot be said about our food. I ordered the grilled chicken teriyaki. My chicken was burned from the grill marks. I mean like black crust, hardened, burned. The sauce they put on it wasn't even teriyaki sauce! Apparently it was some kind of noodle sauce which you're supposed to dilute but they didn't so it was super-salty. My friends (being poor students) felt the portions were small. The plate itself was huge with a scoop of rice- it just made the portions look even smaller. I think I would have been more satisfied with a hot dog from the vendor outside.    As the other posters have said, this is not the place to go for good food, especially if you want more  \"authentic\" asian food. If you just want to lounge/hang out & have a couple of drinks, then its an okay choice."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here with my mom while she was visiting Toronto.  We visited quite a few restaurants so there are a few more reviews to come :)  We checked out their $25 three-course dinner menu.  We both chose the spring roll appetizer, while my mom chose a chicken/shrimp low mein dish as an entree and I had the General Tao chicken dish.  For dessert we both had the creme brulee.  Portion sizes were decent and the presentation was nice.  Overall, the food was okay and the meal was enjoyable and the $25 price tag was reasonable for what we got.  However, the service was a little slow, but to be fair it was a busy Thursday night.     As for the ambiance, the restaurant was quite busy and a bit loud, but it was Thursday night and rather late for dinner.  They had a private event on the rootop patio so unfortunately, we were not able to sit out there.  Instead, we were seated at a small table near the sidewalk patio, which evnethough it wasn't outside, it was quite nice."}
{"text":"As a HUGE Asian fusion cuisine fan, Dazzling truly stimulated my tastebuds and made my tummy growl as I entered this place and smelled the delicious smelling aroma.  I went there for the first time a bit ago for a Valentine's Day dinner. Since I live around the corner from this strip of King West restos, I thought I should try something new - apart from all of the Italian places we have dined at on that strip.  To begin, my dinner companion and I ordered two reasonably-priced glasses of white wine - $8 per glass - to celebrate the special evening.  As I drank my wine, I looked through the HUGE menu and actually became a bit overwhelmed with the selection. Dazzling definitely offers tons of opinions and offers dishes from the Chinese, Japanese and Thai food groups.  To start, we ordered the Dazzling Spicy on UFO for an appetizer. This was such an amazing appy, with spicy salmon and tuna on top of sweet potatoes and cucumber. The combination of hot and cold foods made this dish very original in terms of taste and presentation.  For our next \"mini\" course as I would call it, we ordered their special Dazzling Roll, which was a scrumptious combo of all types of seafood and fish you can think of... shrimp, eel, smoke salmon and crab. This was rolled up with some veggies, seaweed paper and rice.   The Dazzling Roll was $14, which is a bit steep but it was HUGE and incorporated tons of seafood.  For mains, my dinner companion ordered the General Tao Chicken for $12. The chicken was steamy hot and was blanketed by batter and sweet and spicy sauce. To top it off, it had some veggies thrown onto the plate. Also, you have the option of doing this dish with beef for the same price.  For my main, I ordered the Black Bean Sauce stirfry with seafood and veggies, which was $14. My meal was so delicious and large! Also, if you are not a seafood lover, you can have this dish with chicken, beef or eggplant.  To finish off the meal, we ordered the asian specialty dessert - THE FRIED BANANA! This sweet dish came with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  Our bill came to around $80, which is not cheap but it was a special evening and we decided to pig out!  I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone craving an evening of Asian fusion food and for people who want to take their special someones out for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty cool ambiance. The food was very good. I had the pad thai and others ordered the bento box / red curry chicken. Price was fair. I recommend."}
{"text":"Not so dazzling. I spent about three hours here with a dear friend catching up. The wait staff, particularly Mary, were patient, attentive and very nice. I think the staff do a great job. For the hype here on Yelp, the food left me wanting. We started with edamame which was unsalted and somewhat cool...the seaweed salad was really nice and I do recommend that...then we tried the california rolls, honestly meh, I've had better in food courts. My companion had the shrimp tempura and said it was very good. We then had our entrees. She had a dish of noodles and shrimp with veg...she didnt eat it all, particularly the over cooked veggies. I had the basil pad thai. There was a lot of food in this entree and it wasn't necesarilly bad, but it didnt stand out. I will say the wine list and martini list is extensive and this is a great place to take your time, linger, catch up with friends. As for the food, you tell me."}
{"text":"I came here looking for something in the area. My meal was good but not a place that I will be returning to any time soon.  I had the tuna tartar- not bad. It had your typical spicy mayo dressing which was not exciting. The chicken thai curry was oily and more spicy than flavorful.    I am sure there are other better places in the area."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is still open is because of its location. I ended up here because I had just seen a show with a friend and he really wanted something Asian, and it was raining so we didn't want to walk around.  We had: - Singapore style noodles - vermecelli noodles in a curry sauce with vegetables, chicken, and shrimp. The chicken was artificial-tasting, rubbery and weird and the vegetables were lacking.  - Fried rice - okay, but you can get better fried rice in Chinatown - Creme brule - the flavour was nice but it was all water-y in texture and way too goopy. Service was pretty good but could not make up for the sub-par food."}
{"text":"How come I never reviewed this place?   I usually come here with Fabio N. for Dinner, and I really like the 3-course japanese dinner. The price is right and I'm a fan of their appetizers. I could have ONLY appetizers, actually.   The service is very good and I think the place is beautiful too. For a reasonable price I eat a lot, have a good time, so I keep coming back."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant equivalent of the emperor has no clothes. Putting on a good show without the goods to back it up, does not make you a good restaurant. The food looks flavorful but the colorful dishes are just pretty decoration for the tasteless soul beneath it. If it were just the food alone, I would have given this place 3 stars, but the staff also lacks passion.   We ordered the green dragon roll and the salt and pepper shrimp. The roll was tasteless and while I normally don't use soy sauce on my sushi, I had to just to give it some flavor. Usually rolls with sauces are flavorful enough on their own, but not in this case... (hint to the sushi chef: usually sushi rice is seasoned).  The salt and pepper shrimp was overly oily and oddly also flavorless unless you got a piece that had a lot off the peppers on it. it's as if they used zero seasoning on the shrimp or the batter and only seasoned the pepper sauce.  As for the service, our waitress acted like she had better things to do than be at work and was just kind of going through the motions of being a waitress without actually putting any effort into her job. I spilled my drink because of our overly cluttered table. Not only did she not make any effort to clean it up or offer me another drink, she sent over a younger, more enthusiastic, nicer waitress to deal with it. If it wasn't for the other waitress, I would give this place one star."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what all the Yelp-hype is over this place. It's certainly adequate, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get back here.  Dazzling modern restaurant (what a douchy name!) serves up Toronto's most overdone cuisine: \"Asian Fusion\". The menu manages to offer Thai, Chinese and Japenese, plus a sushi bar at the back.  The food was quite good! I had a thai green curry with chicken ($14), It was served with coconut sticky rice. The portion was decent and the curry was rich. The rice was delicious; it wasn't quite as \"sticky\" as when you get it served in a bamboo basket, but the coconut flavour more than made up for that.  My dinner date had some kind of spicy lemongrass chicken ($12) which also got 2 thumbs up.  Decor is nice, staff were attentive, but overall I just felt like this place was trying a bit too hard to be cool."}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for sushi in the Toronto area.  I was in Toronto for about 5 days, and the food and service were so good, my friends and I went twice.  Good food, and excellent service.  Would definitely recommend to a friend."}
