{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place. My husband and I went the week they opened and the service was really bad. We went back just the other night in hopes to have a better experience and unfortunately the staff is just super bad. After waiting for our food for an hour, we realized the server was avoiding us so my husband asked us for an update on our food. The server told us that he was \"late putting it in\" aka forgot, and that it would be done soon. We waited another 20 minutes before the food came out. There was no real apology from the server and he also didn't comp the check at all for his error. What's frustrating, is we were super understanding with him when we could have grabbed the manager and put up a fuss. Because we were easy going, he didn't see it necessary to take care of us in any way. Super bad customer service and will absolutely not go back. At least they got our orders right this time? That's the only positive thing I can say."}
{"text":"Once again, great food!  And, great service.  While I normally go for the mac cheese, this time I went for the Mac & cheese hamburger with fries.  Everything  was wonderful with the best of both worlds - hamburger and Mac & cheese.  May sound a little strange but is was good.
Draft beer half off during happy hour so you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Great experience start to finish.  Friendly greeting at the door and we're seated immediately.  Waitress was super pleasant and helpful all evening.  My wife and I each had a burger.  I got the skinny burger which is essentially a bun less burger with a roasted red pepper and avocado.  I ordered medium but came out more mid-well though was very good and the homemade chips were delicious.  My wife got the portobello burger - reading the menu it looked like a grilled mushroom cap instead of a burger but the waitress explained it is a portobello on top of a half pound burger.  The balsamic aioli was the PERFECT addition to the burger, which was outstanding.  Onions rings were top notch - big and crunchy though $7 a bit steep for the portion size.  We got an adult size portion of bacon mac and cheese for our twin 5 year olds to share and it did not disappoint.  It was clearly homemade.  Creamy cheese, good size bacon bits, crunchy fries and the green onion was the perfect finish of texture and flavor.  Huge portion too which meant we're excited for leftovers even after all 4 of us picked from the skillet throughout the meal (it comes out in a hot cast iron skillet, nice touch).

Manager was also friendly and staff were all clearly working nicely together to create a pleasant atmosphere for everyone....can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"When we went to Mac & Toz I thought it was going to be great. It looked nice,had a great atmosphere,and wonderful staff. But sadly the food was not up to par. My family and I had gotten 4 different types of the Mac and cheese and it was very disappointing. All of our food was cold,and was too over whelming on the flavor factor. And specifically the lobster mac & cheese, the lobster wasn't lobster, it was a langostino similar to a hermit crab. Overall an average experience and I would make different choices in the future."}
{"text":"Great service and good food, decent drink selection. Biggest complaint is that the music was too loud to have a conversation and there wasn't a diaper changing station in the bathroom - not a big deal for most customers, but if you're coming with a baby like we did, it is an inconvenience. I also felt that while the food was good, the prices were higher than what they should've been for what the restaurant had to offer.  Overall, good experience and we will probably be back!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that we love \"Bakn,\" which is also in the hands of the owner of this place. Although I love his other restaurant, i'm not so sure about this place yet. It looks as though this may have been a soft opening, but that shouldn't make a difference one way or the other. My wife and I met 2 friends here and the a/c wasn't working, and it was about 85 degrees out. (It felt cooler outside) we decided to deal with it and eat here anyways. The waitress told us that the grill wasnt working, so no burgers. We all had high expectations for the food. When our food came out we were suprised that the cheese sauce was so runny. I like the mac and cheese from \"Sauce\" better which is the name of the restaurant that used to be there. The food tasted good but didn't quite meet our expectations based on the other restaurant he owns. The fries reminded me of burger king fries which isn't neccesarily a bad thing. So here's the breakdown. The food was good but not great, and in my opinion a lil overpriced along with the beer. I realize that they just opened so in time I may give them another chance, but so far nothing really is impressing."}
{"text":"Completely overpriced.  Manhattan for $22?  Had to send the burger back twice and still not done medium.  Slow service, but very nice wait staff.   Extremely disappointing as their other place Bakn is great.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Three of us stopped in on a Monday afternoon and each ordered one of the macaroni skillets. When the food came it was presented in a skillet with a padded handle to prevent burning yourself on that handle. To my surprise the food itself, though tasty, was actually lukewarm -- which happened to match the service. This is NOT Bakn."}
{"text":"HUGE portions and honestly way tastier than expected. The side mac and cheese with an app is probably the way I'd go next time."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food !!  The bar has a nice selection of beers and if you are into whisky you will find a wide variety to choose from.. The MAC and Cheese was amazing ...It's a must try!!I'll defiantly be back.."}
{"text":"A five star experience from start to finish. Attentive service and an upscale selection of appetizers and entrees that deliver more than one would expect from a local AleHouse. 6 of us enjoyed the Mediterranean plate and zucchini apps. The burgers were great and the lobster mac and cheese was as huge as it was delicious. Great Friday night spot for a beverage selection and upscale comfort food. Would definitely return  for both the creative cuisine and the ambience."}
{"text":"Oh no. Nope. Nope. Nope. I was so hopeful, but this is the third disappointing visit. They have cocktails on the menu that the bartenders can't make (which isn't their fault - it's the managements. Train the damn people to make what you put on the menu or don't put it on the menu, please). They have food that underwhelms at best and it's insanely overpriced. If you want to experience mediocrity at a subpar dining experience level, come waste your money here."}
{"text":"Went at 11am on Sunday. Fairly empty. Ordered \"all balled up\" and it was very good and you got a decent amount. My wife and I ordered the \"mac attack.\" Shortly after ordering we were told that one of the ingredients (bacon) they were out of. I could see if it was busy or later in the day, but considering we were the only people eating and you just opened, you should probably have a better grasp of your inventory, especially when you own a bacon centric restaurant in Carnegie. Anyway we get it without the bacon. Large portions was a plus. The fries and onion rings were great. The mac and cheese however was just okay. I thought it was a little watery and bland for my tastes. Thinking it may tasted better left over once it's allowed to thicken up a bit. Definitely missed the bacon. Waitress was very polite. Food was out quickly. Overall was a pretty mediocre experience. We were also charged full price for a menu item that was missing an ingredient. I doubt we will be back. I'd give it 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here after reading an article about new Pittsburgh restaurants opening in 2017. Came on a Saturday afternoon and there were only 2 other people that were there at the time. Ordered the Mac Attack without the bacon which was honestly nothing special. Just some good comfort food. They have a great selection of different types of whiskey and a taste pour is standard for all their bottles so I was able to taste something that would always be out of my price range. Coming from 30 minutes away, I most likely will not be coming back anytime soon. It just isn't worth the long drive for something I could just make at home."}
{"text":"We were there for a meeting.  The group room was behind the kitchen with 3 very big tvs.

Our server was prompt and didnt interfere with the meeting.

Portion sizes were HUGE.  The group was split between salad people and mac n cheese people.  The salads were in medium size metal mixing bowls.  The mac n cheese was served in a cast iron skillet.

Everyone left with a doggie bag.

This review would have been a 4 * if they accepted American Express. 

Street and pay parking lots are available."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick-up, so can't attest to service. Was ready sooner than expected, and exactly as predicted. We ordered the Cheddar Mac for the kids to split, Buffalo Bleu for me, and Mac Attack for the husband.

1. Cheddar Mac: flavorless, honestly (see pics). It was mostly cooked noodles, scant cheese sauce, melted shredded cheese and panko. When your kids won't eat the Mac n cheese, you're in trouble....
2. Buffalo Bleu: right amount of Buffalo sauce (though I'd prefer more), and when the Bleu cheese melts with the Cheddar sauce (was present on mine, would not have been sufficient if no other sauce/cheese), it was great. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the char complimented the dish. The onion rings? Soggy with buffalo sauce by the time we got home and are probably best in-house.
3. Mac Attack: fries were soggy, chives sliced but not separated and therefore two stalks on top. Husband commented that he, too, had an absence of cheese sauce and mostly tasted like cooked noodles.

I think soggy fries and onion rings are a result of taking the food out of the restaurant. However, mac and cheese really should represent with the cheese. I hit gold, and we'll probably try in-house to see of this was a fluke, but disappointing to get home after a long day and still have to feed the kids & husband. Overall, 2/3 dishes were cooked noodles with toppings, leaving a lot to be desired from a place that has\"Mac\" in the name."}
{"text":"Went to try this place out since we are fans of their other restaurant Bakn.  Cool atmosphere, nice bar, and the food was fine.

However, the ladies room smelled like there were rotting dead animals in there and had flys.  My husband said the men's room was the same.  I can't believe a place serving food would have bathrooms like this. It made me feel very gross about the restaurant. I have been in much better kept bathrooms in Southside dive bars at 2am.

Bakn is better!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place out so last Saturday we ventured into Bridgeville. They do have on street parking and lots which are free after 6 pm.   We sat at the bar which had plenty of seats although it was early on a Saturday evening. The tables seemed so close together (pretty small inside) so I liked the space we had at the bar.  They also advertised a large backroom that you could rent out although we did not see it.  They have a number of beers on draft and bottled. I went with the Leinkugel Summer Shandy and my husband got Victory Summer Love.   The menu is not huge and they have salads, burgers, mac and cheese.  I ordered the mac and cheese burger which was served with homemade chips. They do not offer a side salad to substitute and the bartender said they are working on that and was happy for the feedback.  I went with their special coleslaw as my side and they only charged an extra $1.50 which was not bad. They burger was very basic but it had loads of mac and cheese on it as well as BBQ sauce, lettuce and tomato.  It was so much I had leftovers for lunch.  My husband got the buffalo mac and cheese served in the skillet which was plenty and even he had trouble eating it all.  The entrees range in price from $12-$14 which I think is a little pricey.  This place was very kid friendly and had some outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Wow! Delicious. My friends and I all enjoyed a speciality mac and cheese. We each got a different one so we could try a few. I had the Mac Attack, which was loaded with bacon, fries, and onion rings on top! The cheese was so creamy. My friend had the Buffalo chicken Mac and cheese, which was delicious and something I would definitely get next time! The other Mac and cheese we tried was the Hot Mess Mac. It had pepper jack cheese and Sriracha sauce. It was good, but not my favorite of the trio. We also split the loaded French fries, which I would definitely recommend. I'd like to go back and try a burger next time!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant in Bridgeville. Good food. Nice beer and cocktail selection. Good service. Hubby had the loaded fries for an appetizer and pulled pork mac n cheese. The mac n cheese portion was huge. He didn't even eat half of it. I had the vegetarian sandwich which was delicious. So nice they had a vegetarian option on the menu. The salads looked good too. My friend had a mac and cheese burger which he enjoyed. The sandwiches and burgers were served with homemade potato chips which were delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service was better than slow but not quite \"fast\". Atmosphere is friendly, and the Mac and cheese options are divine! Would have given 4 stars but....

The kitchen left wax paper packaging IN my husband's burger. Gross. 

We might come back for the happy hour discounts and onion rings, but not for the main menu. 

UPDATE: the staff here is amazing. They really care about their customers and want to repair their relationship with the community. Under new management, Mac and Toz is seriously whipping themselves into shape. 

We came back expecting to only sit at the bar, and the manager Audree actually remembered us the moment we walked in. She was super apologetic and I can really tell she wanted to make sure things were settled properly with us. We had our meals comped, and we'll definitely be back for more then just beer!"}
{"text":"My husband and I did not have a great experience in our first visit. I will say that the place was new so they were still a work in progress. 
I asked for Malibu & pineapple and they did not ANY coconut rum, so I had a Long Island. 
Before I continue, let me just say the staff was very nice and friendly. 
We then ordered the Ultimate Nachos. They were terrible! It seemed like the cook just dumped a bag of tortilla chips on a platter and threw a few other sparse ingredients on. 
When asked my husband told the bartender how bad they were. The manager/part owner came over and talked with us. She took the nachos off of the bill. She was very nice and said she appreciated the feedback. She said she would speak to the cook and have him come over and talk to us. He never did come over, so we left. 
We WILL go back again and I'm sure we'll have a more positive experience."}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday for brunch fare. $20 on the worst bloody marys. The food was too pricey for what was offered. It was so disappointing. I miss the breakfast when this location was called Sauce."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken parm sandwich with a side of the cheddar Mac. Sandwich was delicious as was the mac & cheese, though the mac was a touch on the creamy side. The portions were more than I could finish. The bar is great with an awesome selection of beers on tap. Service was great, though the place wasn't really busy. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Great environment and wonderful service. The burgers and mac & cheese were good, but it was the whiskey selection that made us want to go back."}
{"text":"Staff was absolutely fantastic! Drink recommendations were phenomenal and food was great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the service is great and the food is even better! Great atmosphere, very laid back and relaxed!"}
{"text":"I could not be happier with this place. The GM and our Server went above and beyond.  The restaurant was packed and they sat us in the back room. It was a room they don't usually use, the heat was set low. The GM immediately cranked up the heat and provided us with music. We told the server, we were new and town and she gave us multiple locations to visit. We both got a specialty Mac and it was immaculate. There was enough in one dish for the both of us. I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"I sincerely hope the problems we encountered were just still in the process of opening pains as I really want to like this place. The happy hour menu states 5 dollar sangria specifically as one of the happy hour deals. I order this and am told they don't have this, despite seeing the ingredients at the bar. I said okay I'll have the bumbleberry draft, then get told they don't have that either. I say okay I'll have water. Then I go to order my food, I ask for the lobster Mac, and guess what, \"we don't have lobster tonight\". I'm then told it's shrimp instead. I say okay and ask if the price is the same and am told it is but there's lots of shrimp to make up for it. So twenty minutes later my food shows up and needless to say there were 7 baby shrimp on Mac and cheese so bland I dumped a ton of salt on it. I'll make my sixteen dollar Mac and cheese at home next time."}
{"text":"Interesting concept capitalizing on the Mac and Cheese trend from 5 years ago.  It was OK.  Nothing to bring me back though.  If you are in the area, I recommend the ugly but delicious Crafty Jackelope withing walking distance.  They not only have better mac n cheese, but a broader menu and some of the best wings around."}
{"text":"Great addition to Bridgeville from the brains behind Bakn. Loved my Left Coast Salad & husband enjoyed his Thai BBQ Wings. Excited to get back and try out more of the menu."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Mac & Toz and we were disappointed. We have been looking forward to the opening of this restaurant for awhile. The beer selection is ok, not as wide as some other places that are defined as ale houses, but a good variety. The Mac and cheese is what we were disappointed in the most. We ordered the loaded fries as an appetizer, the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of cheddar Mac, and the lobster Mac. The loaded fries were primarily covered with a basic cheddar sauce that didn't have much flavor, barely any bacon and scallions, and a large amount of mushy tomatoes. The chicken sandwich was definitely the best item we got, along with our beers. The side Mac has the same basic cheddar sauce on it that, to me, seemed similar to Velveeta. The lobster Mac also had the same cheddar sauce, but because of the additions, had more flavor. While we didn't get any of the other mac and cheese dishes, they all seemed to have the same basic cheese foundation with assorted toppings, I wish they had different base sauces to make them more appealing. If you go my recommendation is to get one of the sandwiches and skip the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Really excellent food here and good service. The Hot Mess Mac was outstanding. The nachos were good too. Salads are a reasonable portion. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying this place for a while now. Mac and cheese is one of my favorite foods so what's not to love?

I went tonight with my husband and his family. I stayed basic with just their plan mac n cheese. I was a little disappointed. First of all, it really needed salt. I added some and then it was much better, but still nothing remarkable - especially considering it's supposed to be a Mac and cheese place. My husband agreed his burger wasn't great. A little burnt. The French fries were bland and boring. 

His family got wings which were huge and looked very good. They also got a salad which looked awesome. If I came back I would probably try something different."}
{"text":"We will always miss Sauce, but were excited when Mac & Toz finally opened. We gave them a while to get settled before trying it, since we know new restaurants can have some issues. The service was very good and the food was good, though my dad was a bit disappointed by the small portobello mushroom on his portobello mushroom burger. He said he wouldn't get that again, though the burger was cooked properly.

The lobster mac & cheese was very good and very large. It was enough food for dinner that night and 2 lunches, since it's so filling. Our waitress said they have a mac & cheese burger coming soon, so we'll definitely have to go back to try that. We were still able to enjoy happy hour specials at the tables, which was nice, too."}
{"text":"This makes me kind of sad. I know it just opened but I was really looking forward to this place. I ordered the skinny burger, asked medium and it was dry. Fries were OK. The biggest down fall was the Mac and cheese side. I was looking forward to that being the main dishes on the menu were Mac and cheese variations. This was a bland, butter noodle type, need to add salt and pepper to even eat it. We ate it, because we were hungry. The bartender asked how it was and I guess the chef missed something that night. We can walk to this place, we actually did walk. I do not think returning will be in the cards. The bartender was very nice to add though."}
{"text":"I can only imagine that the good reviews for this place had to be from people that know how food should be cooked or know the owners.  
7 People for Dinner 
Monday Night. Not Busy at all 
Ordered...2 kids chicken fingers. Kids ate them. 
1. Salmon Burger - salmon was half the size of the bun it came on. WAY OVERCOOKED and the cucumber that came on the side of the plate looked like it had been freezer burned, thawed, maybe freezer burned again..then put on the plate. 
2. Chicken Salad. You know how you can look at a piece of chicken and tell how dry it is going to be...yeah I think it was even dryer then that. 
3. The rest of us got burgers...skinny burger, mac and cheese burger and some spicy burger.
Again when I say they were over cooked I could have played hockey with them they were so dry.. I could have got a better burger at Wendys. 
Side of Fries...not fresh at all...they had been sitting in the back for way to long. 
Side of Mac and Cheese...again Dry.

The server was very sweet. Being that we all work or have worked in restaurants we ate what we could and took it as a loss knowing we won't ever come back. 
I would get the manager off his cell phone (he was outside on it the ENTIRE time we were there) and have him actually see what is coming out of the kitchen. 
Overpriced. Overcooked Food."}
{"text":"This place has it going on! Lots of drink options, and of course the myriad of mac-n-cheese dishes. It's welcoming and full of cheerful staff ready to bring you customized dishes and drinks. The wife and I tried two different signature offerings, the lobster mac and the mac attack. Bother were far better than expected. Five stars well deserved!"}
{"text":"We thought that mac n cheese would be good for dinner and chose the Mac Attack.  The portion size was great.  However, the food was not hot.  In fact, an onion ring was cold!  The server was wonderful and offered to reheat the food.  The second time the food came, it was marginally hotter but there were burnt items (fries and onion rings).  It was very disappointing that the restaurant couldn't serve hot food that wasn't burnt."}
{"text":"Loved the food and great service!  I'd say the best zucchini appetizer I've ever had, just a little different than the rest."}
{"text":"Was very recited to check this place out especially since they have outside tables for a nice day. However they don't use the.m for dinner. Real smart.  Bartender was nice but 0 local beers or whiskeys.  They also dont have large ice blocks for whiskey on the rocks but they. have the ice traysFried zucchini I was piling hot but good, however the lobster mac is actually langastino's which were overcooked and the cheese sauce was more like a bechamel than a creamy cheese.  I do hope they can figure things out as it is a cool looking place. Staff was nice at least"}
{"text":"We love Bakn so we were excited to give this a try. It didn't disappoint. While it's small, and I would imagine could get quite a crowd going in the evenings, we got there a little earlier on a Friday and sat at the bar. Service at the bar was a little lacking, considering it wasn't completely full, they seemed to spend alot of time chatting while my glass was empty, but whatever. The food is genuinely delicious. I had a delicious salad, my husband had mac and cheese, both were packed with flavor. It was a little bit of a wait, but I watched the kitchen bust out orders quickly, so I don't think it was a \"slow kitchen\" more of a volume of orders. Overall, I'd try this place again. Drinks were pricey, food was definitely reasonable."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hot Mess, which was mac and cheese with jalapenos, pepper jack cheese and sriracha. At least that's what the menu said. The sriracha is actually sriracha mayonnaise, which they didn't say. I thought I made a mistake and didn't see it, so I was real apologetic about sending it back, but then I rechecked the menu. What they say is wrong. Aside from that,  the cheddar cheese sauce was so bland I wasn't sure there was any on it at all. If mac and cheese is their big ticket, I think they're going the way of Sauce."}
{"text":"A business colleague and I often had lunch at the previous establishment Sauce. Despite the new look, cleanliness, multiple draft beer dispenser, etc., we were not impressed with the menu and felt all items were priced too high for Bridgeville.  The fact that there was a very small lunch group there that day, I think, bares that out. 
Staff was friendly and owner acknowledged us but he should consider lowering prices,  adding food specials for happy hour, ditching the flavorless chips and, for God's sake, offer soup(s). 
It's such a pain to get a parking spot that a place like this might consider specials of the day to make the parking and downtown driving adventure worth it.
We may try this place again but not likely."}
{"text":"I came here recently to try because I always drive by it. I've heard good things and I wanted to try it for myself. I went on a Wednesday night and it wasn't too busy. I liked the atmosphere and the decor. I got the black and bleu tots for an appetizer and they were good. A little salty, but still good. I then got the Parmesan chicken sandwich and added avocado and it was awesome. I could only eat half, but mostly because I wanted to eat more when I got home. Very nice presentation and filled me up perfectly. I would definitely recommend this place. My server Jon was excellent and the bar tender Tommy poured a wonderful beer. The manager Audrey also came over to make sure everything was good. Very kind and professional. Overall I had a great meal and superb service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Catie d. Worst bartender I have come across in the Pittsburgh area. Didn't even speak to us. Started a conflict and gossiped about my partner and I to other customers. Completely unprofessional. Also didn't even mention happy hour to us while bringing it to everyone else's attention around us. Utterly disrespectful. Brenden however was very kind and informative about the menu items. Great customer service. Food was delicious and came quickly. Would recommend for food but not the delightful catie."}
{"text":"This place is a hotttt mess. I've never seen a poorly ran business to this degree. They don't even have a phone number. The number on all of their sites says the number for Bacn and the people who answer those phones are RUDE! They gave me a number that goes straight to voicemail for 4 hours. They need to hire someone to manage this place better. It's terrible. I'll bet the service is extremely poor. I'll update this review once I actually get in tonight.... if that happens."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food is delicious and service is great! They hosted a party for me and Audrey did an excellent job taking care of every detail! I highly recommend it for the food and beverages or if you need a place to host a party! Thank you for making my party special!!"}
{"text":"FYI:  I stopped today at lunch-time, and the door was locked.  I see they have new hours, and are no longer open for lunch on weekdays.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"Im not a huge fan of Mac n cheese but my best friend is so we decided to try Mac n Toz. I was pleasantly suprised! I had the Mac attack which was delicious (just a tad salty) and a mixed greens salad. The vinegrette was so good! She had the lobster Mac and loved it too! Portions are big, I got 3 meals out of it. Drink prices are outrageous though. We would have stayed and chatted after we ate but I wasn't paying another $8 for a beer."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place isn't as popular as Bakn (owned by the same people, I think). I really enjoyed it and actually think it was better than Bakn. 

We started off with the Loaded Fries which were SO good. Highly recommend getting ranch on the side. This was a good appetizer for 2-3 people but if there are more of you, it might not be enough. 

I got the Buffalo Bleu Mac which was a little pricey but they gave you a lot. I had enough left over for a whole meal the next day. I would've liked a little more buffalo sauce but that's because I'm weird and drench my meals in it. For the average buffalo lover, it probably was enough. 

My boyfriend got the Pork and Mac which was really good - I tried it. That dish actually inspired me to make it at home, too. 

Overall, I had a really good experience! I think it's a little pricey but for the most part, worth it."}
{"text":"This place used to be Sauce but has been remodeled and renamed. I have been twice. The first time I went with a big group of people-10 or 11. We had called ahead so they were ready for us. Most people go for the Mac n Cheese. Most of the people I was with got the Lobster Mac n cheese. I went a different route and got a Bleu Cheese burger both times. Why? Because they do it well. If you order a burger \"medium\" it comes out medium. A true medium. The Bleu Cheese crumbles actually get a tiny bit melty and have a strong flavor (which I love. The burgers are juicy-no dryness here. 
Though I didn't order the Lobster Mac n cheese I did share some of my friends each time. The noodles are a long spiral elbow noodle. The cheese is gooey. It comes in a cast iron skillet. It is just the right ratio of cheese to noodle. It's kind of nice going with friends because I get to have a happy plate of a great burger and great Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has only 3 stars. My family and I have been there 3 times and everything we've had has been really really good (especially the pulled pork mac & cheese with jalapeños) the service has been great and the beer selection is nice. Just give it a shot.......you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We had the intention last Friday night of going to a different bar, but it ended up being packed since there was a Penguins game that night. I consider it good luck on our part because we walked down the street and stumbled upon Mac & Toz. Much quieter and a less rowdy crowd which was nice. Don't get me wrong, it was still a great place to be for the game but it didn't have the vibe of frat party gone wild when you walked in. No offense to those of you in a fraternity lol. We actually got there during happy hour which was great so we had a couple beers on tap half off and appetizers for $5. The wings we ordered were the sweet and spicy. The wings are fried and then a dry rub added, so no sticky, juicy mess eating them.  For dinner we both went for a signature mac and cheese. These dishes are large, easily 2 meals worth and so tasty. The Buffalo Bleu Cheese was spicy but no too much and had plenty of chicken in it as well. The Mac Attack was like a bacon cheeseburger turned mac and cheese. Would definitely go back to try a different version of these. The service was good as well. No military discount."}
{"text":"Despite all of the bad reviews online my family and I were excited to try Mac and Toz. We went in with low expectations and still left disappointed.
We ordered an appetizer first which we never received.  When our server finally came over to check on us after receiving our dinners we mentioned we had never received our appetizer.  He replied with \"I thought you guys decided against that\"  there was clearly no question that we ever questioned an appetizer when we placed the order.  It's one thing to admit you made a mistake but to take no accountability is what was really pathetic.  The food was just ok nothing that I would want to go back for especially with the service we experienced."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, food and service all really good.  Casual night out spot.  The Grilled Chicken sandwich was delicious with avocado  and aioli on a focaccia roll.  The Mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy with a great crunchy topping."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place before where it was sauce and the Mac and cheese there was amazing. Mac and toz wasn't nearly as good. The I had the Mac attack, the cheese sauce was very water down and lacked flavor. The fries and onion rings were really good but the actual Mac and cheese I'd pass on if I went back.  Also. I went with a group of friends and we all hoped they had tots, they don't, just saying.  Prices are on the high end but not worth it."}
{"text":"Updated interior from the previous place.  Looks good and they got rid of the awful booths. Our waitress was very good and answered our questions.  Luckily it was cool outside, they had a couple of fans running and pulling in some outside air; must be a air conditioning issue. 
Ordered the Buffalo Bleu Mac which I enjoyed but nothing special.  Looking forward to coming back and trying one of the sandwiches."}
{"text":"My family decided to eat at Mac and Tov while visiting my sister. I was excited to see the variety of draft beers. I ordered a craft beer to find they were out of it. I asked the waitress if the draft list was up to date and she said no they had different ones. She then just stood there and didn't tell me what they did have currently on draft. Other than the subpar service from our waitress, the food was good. I recommend the Pork and Mac. The portions are large. I shared with my daughter and still had plenty of leftovers. I would go back hoping the wait staff would improve."}
{"text":"The food has gotten better since the first time we were there. Service has been slow every time we have been there. The tots they added are excellent."}
{"text":"Very yum! So happy we came.. 
first off we walked in during happy hour, which is until 7 BTW! The beer is half off during happy hour, they have a nice selection of all different types -- light beer, porters, lagers, IPA's. What more do you need? The beer was COLD, clean and just yummy! But all wells are also on happy hour.  They have a nice selection of wine too!
I had the buffalo chicken Mac and cheese. It was honestly amazing. The chicken was great quality and the flavor was outstanding. My fiancé had the pepperjack cheeseburger with jalapeños. The only complaint he had was he ordered it medium and it clearly came out well done. But it was still good, he ate the whole thing! 
The fries were nice and crispy and had a balanced seasoning on them. 
We really loved everything and I cannot wait to come back and try more!!"}
{"text":"This location has gone through several different restaurants. I was excited to try Mac & Toz as I love mac & cheese. My friend and I came here on a Friday night and were seated right away. All the staff was very friendly. Since the restaurant was small, it was quite loud as it was crowded. I had the lobster mac and cheese and my friend had the buffalo chicken mac and cheese. Both mac and cheeses were served in a cast iron skillet. The portions are huge so you can definitely share one if you want. The lobster mac and cheese was delicious. The lobster was sweet, juicy, and a nice addition to the creamy mac and cheese. My friend enjoyed her buffalo mac and cheese. Her only complaint was that there could have been more buffalo sauce. An excellent choice for any mac and cheese lover. Would go back and want to try their wings! A nice addition in the Bridgeville area."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been waiting to get here since we are big 
Bakn fans.  When we arrived, the manager Audrey greeted us and explained some of the new items on the menu.  Our server was polite and professional.  The food, the service, and the price did not disappoint.  I will be bringing my friends very soon to enjoy this neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Today was their Grand Opening so we decided to stop by for the Pens game and check it out. We are huge fans of Bak'n so we expected the menu to be delicious and it sure was! We tried the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Loaded Fries. I was pleasantly surprised that the cheese seemed to be a fresh sauce rather than premade or from a can. They both tasted AMAZING! The Loaded fries had fresh fries, cheese, tomatoes, scallions and bacon! The Lobster Mac had chunks of Lobster in it. They have a pretty extensive selection of Mac n Cheese and a wide variety of Whiskey and Bourbon. The space is outfitted with 16 2-tops, some pushed together to seat parties of 4. They also have a table right in the front that seats 6-8, a private party room in the back and plenty of seats at the bar. We look forward to making this our new hangout spot!!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of Bakn, I was anxious to try out this new concept restaurant. The place is set up very nice with a beer bar to your left as you enter and chairs for regular dining to your right. I had learned this place has been open for a little over two weeks now and are still smoothing out the rough edges. There is a TV in the back. Free WiFi is available. Pass code available upon request or at chalkboard by the bar.

The waitress staff was beyond compare when it came to service.  Although their signature item is macaroni and cheese I knew I couldn't eat that after having consumed a large breakfast. Will try that on a return visit. I was amazed because over at the next table was a young girl who ordered it as a side and believe me for a side dish, it was pretty huge!

I decided to order the grilled chicken sandwich with avocado which comes with potato chips, pickle, lettuce and tomato along with a salad dressing if I wanted some flavor. It took a while to get the food but believe me it was worth it. Chicken was cooked fresh and I'm a big fan of avocado so it did not disappoint. It was very good!! Please note that if you want other sides then you would have to pay for them like fries or mac and cheese.

As i was eating I got to meet the manager Troy Kasper who inquired how I was enjoying my lunch. I learned from him that he used to work at Sienna Mercado downtown but jumped on the bandwagon when he decided to go into this new business. He explained to me that the business is named for the two owners and they are a sister restaurant of Bakn in Carnegie. He felt that he wanted to make sure customers feel welcome when they come to this establishment and asked for some input from me.

I told him it would be great if they could post a menu online so people could see their offerings and plan accordingly. He told me they are currently working on that matter and should have one available in a couple of weeks. I made an error in my notes thinking they have gender neutral restroom. Correction. They do not but the ladies room was missing a place to put your purse. I brought this to his attention when I left and he told me the hook had been broken off but will get it replaced immediately.

This was a very good sandwich and the attention to detail and personal interaction with guest makes for an enjoyable experience. It is located in Bridgeville near one of their two pay lots and the cost of parking is reasonable.

Looking forward to return visit to try out their signature mac and cheese items."}
{"text":"The food was great and came in a big portion. I ordered the hot mess mac, a spicy mac n cheese, and it was fantastic. The restaurant itself is a little small and very loud. But the service was great, the waiter was very attentive, friendly, and fast, and the owner checked in on us to make sure everything was just right. The food is great and for about $10 a mac n cheese platter, I will be coming back a lot more."}
{"text":"I have been to Mac and Toz twice since opening and we have had a great experience each time! I loved the blue cheese Mac and cheese, as well as the Mac and cheese bites. We suggested to one of the staff on ways to improve the new menu of including queso with the cheese balls instead of marinara sauce. That is our only suggestion but everything was wonderful and we will be returning!"}
{"text":"This evening, I visited Mac & Toz Alehouse with my wife and family.  I will start off by saying the customer service was top notch.  The reason for the three star review, unfortunately, is because of the food quality.  

We started off with the loaded nachos.  They were covered in cheese, jalapeños, black olives, and chicken.  I enjoyed these very much.  They were well done and perfect for sharing among a large table.

As my entree, I ordered the mac and cheese burger with french fries.  This is considered to be their signature burger.  The first thing I noticed was a large black curly hair laying across my fries.  I pulled the hair off and powered through, putting this out of my mind.  I considered sending it back, but my mom convinced me to suck it up, which I did. I requested my burger to be cooked medium well.  It was super well done, and there was actually a burnt taste to the burger.  It was also topped with mac and cheese, bbq sauce, and bacon bits. Honestly, the burger would have been much better had the patty been of higher quality.

The fries were nothing to write home about.  They were just a standard french fry.  I would definitely give this establishment another try.  However, I was left feeling a little underwhelmed."}
{"text":"First time here and I was not impressed. We ordered zucchini planks (great), lobster mac (eh), and the skinny burger (ok). The lobster mac lacked decadence. Had potential but didn't love it. Burger had great ingredients but needed salt and it was a \"skinny\" premade burger. Not sure if it was supposed to be 1/2lb like the others but it was definitely not 1/2lb. one thing I can rave about is the service. We sat at the bar and the bartender was helpful, talkative and knowledgeable. He asked what we thought of the lobster mac and took our criticism to the owner. He said that this is what they did with bakn, made tweaks until they got it perfect. Not thrilled with this visit but will come again when they have a chance to work the kinks out."}
