{"text":"The decor and plates were certainly a blast from the past.  Food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"A bit better than average run of the mill Chinese food buffet. Go on and stuff your face. The seafood is alright I guess. The sushi is subpar just don't go just for the sushi. The service is better then average."}
{"text":"Our experience on my daughters birthday was more then pleasant. It was now to see so many smiles from the staff the cleanliness of the Buffett and rest rooms above par!   The owners are present and welcome you personally. They were very nice to my children and never experienced any discomfort allowing them to help themselves   This is normally the case at buffets.   The price was what you'd expect from the franchise but our family (4) left full and happy and will be returning for $80 inc tip $64 before and we stuck with water. AFTER ALL ITS A BUFFET!   Joe and Lily never stopped smiling worked though problems and made us feel important even as our section got busier.   The only thing I could think about that was not perfect was the language barrier. We had a hard time understanding mostly everything that was said to our table.   From the moment you enter to the moment you leave enjoy the great tasting multiple flavour foods and endless desert buffet in style and comfort.   Thanks Jerry and staff for a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"The Mandarin in Box Grove is one of my favourite restaurants in Ontario! This is such a quiet location. Love, love, love their huge selection of food - my friends and I try to go as often as we can!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food choices, great amount of space, A+ service!"}
{"text":"Favorite buffet spot of all time! I love the ambience.They have artificial flowers and trees inside the restaurant.It looks so cool. They have huge fish tanks and it's perfect to keep the kids busy after meal.Food is AWESOME!!!!! They have so much variety of meats,veggie,seafood and desserts.I always take my out of town guests to this buffet. They all rave about it and wish they had a Mandarin in US."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday for lunch with four kids.  My children loved the food.  Pretty good deal for children (1/2 price for kids and $2 for 4 y.o. and under).  Water fountains with goldfish in the waiting area.  Aquariums with live fish to look at while eating.  I didn't see any real dim sum but there was plenty of other food to eat like roast beef, sushi, soups, lots of desserts, etc.  My son was excited that his fortune cookie says he won a 'free dinner' so Mandarin will be mailing us a coupon for free dinner for 1 person."}
{"text":"Ever since my family's first visit, this has been my favourite restaurant. The staff are VERY friendly. Every holiday there will be holiday specials, for example, on Mid-autumn festival, you get pumpkin pie ice cream and on Thanksgiving you get stuffed turkey, so holidays are a good time to go. Birthdays are also worth going to because you get a special dessert and your picture taken. Its food is great and you get your food, they don't serve it to you, and I like get-food restaurants. Overall the best so far."}
{"text":"Trust me, I did not expect Mandarin serving authentic Chinese food at the very beginning. For a $24.99 dinner buffet, it is slightly cheaper than the Dragon Legend, however the food that here was way way worse than Dragon Legend. This is the first time I come to Mandarin buffet, I read the review from yelp. People were saying sushi selection was ok. That's why I though maybe I should give it a try. Keep it simple, there was absolutely no fish in their sushi selection, don't even think about sashimi. I saw something red in the sushi roll, thinking oh maybe it's tuna roll. Wrong! It's a piece of watermelon wrapped with rice and they called it a fruit roll. Other funny rolls include lemon chicken roll, black rice sushi... they all look very dry to me. Well, I will pass.  Table full of chicken balls, spring rolls, fries and other deep fried food.   Thanks Mandarin buffet for giving me a so unauthentic Asian food experience. I will pay a couple dollars more next time to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"C'est un Mandarin, que dire de plus ? C'est du buffet qui sort largement du cadre de la cuisine asiatique. Un accueil chaleureux, presque trop d'ailleurs et à la limite de la caricature. Le buffet est toujours trompeur, devant la quantité présentée, on choisit toujours un peu de tout et de n'importe quoi pour au final payer cher ce qu'on aurait pu avoir ailleurs."}
{"text":"I have been to a few mandarins and this one is definitely on the lower end.  Most of the best dishes that other mandarins have like New York steak are mysteriously absent at this location.  Overall, mediocre at best and hugely overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Mandarin Buffet is NOT a Chinese buffet regardless of what they call it. There is Asian influence, but other than some traditional \"Chinese food\" such as chicken balls, and wonton soup, a small (cooked) Sushi bar,  a few Asian inspired veggie dishes and some seasonal \"special menu items\" -- it is mostly north American cuisine.   The food there is excellent regardless of what inspires the chefs though -- and that is what is important !   Clam Chowder, Roasted Salmon, baked mussles, Prime Rib for dinner, with mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, with brown gravy and au jus. (does that sound Chinese to you?!)   A full salad selection, hot and cold seafood selections, a massive dessert bar and 8 flavours of ice cream --  its amazing -- and versatile.  Having a romantic night out with your loved one?  They can provide the ambiance needed. A 60th birthday party? They can seat you! Team get together? Yup -- they have room for you too!  In all this location has 6 separate dining areas all with beautiful decorations. And the staff, are always super friendly and attentive -- I have never reached the bottom of my soda glass!  The owners of this location also make it a point to travel the dining area and introducing themselves to the diners and asking for feedback so they can improve on any shortcomings.   Bottom line is -- it's a great place to eat and it's affordable. Food is fresh and hot, and the lines move quickly.  (Special note -- if you are there for dinner, you can ask the Sushi counter for a custom Sashimi platter! )"}
{"text":"We felt the all you can eat buffet was mediocre. . There was a lot of variety though we personally felt it all tasted similar - salty and greasy."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location since it opened....the best Mandarin in the GTA!  Always courteous staff, plentiful of fresh food, very clean and lots of parking available.  Really enjoyed Canada Day's complimentary meal to CDN citizens.  What a great way to give back and pay it forward to the community.   My family likes to celebrate all our special occasions here."}
{"text":"Just got back from a fairly mediocre experience.  I have never quite liked the food that the Mandarin franchise serves. Everything is either sweet and sour, or deep fried with sweet and sour, or some variant, thereof. After reading some good reviews about this location, I thought it might be different, so gave it a go.  Nope, food was just as bad. Roast beef tough as shoe leather; shrimp overcooked; canned salmon tastes better than their; sushi is ridiculous (peanut butter??; strawberry avacado???); chicken was all deep fried in some form or another, in some sour sauce or sweet and sour sauce; pork was the same as chicken; wonton soup just salted water; etc. Desserts are poor. Supermarket quality, if even that.  I understand that this is not supposed to be Chinese food, but Asian influenced food. But then it is just bad, even based on that view. The quality is just not there. At $27 a head, all in, I would have enjoyed myself more at any of the Indian or Hakka Indian takeout in the area.  Higher quality food at a fraction of the cost.  The only redeeming note was that the service was very attentive and kind. Else, it would have been a very upsetting experience.  My advice: stay clear of this place, unless you are only in it for the service. But who eats out only to experience service if the food is no good?"}
{"text":"* Food is above average and well presented for a buffet * Place is beautifully decorated and looks clean * Average priced buffet  * Good service and can get insane busy at times"}
{"text":"Mandarin is in a nutshell a nicely decorated canadianized Chinese buffet with many options to offer. The service is okay, though sometimes it's slightly hard to catch the staffs attention to clear plates. Buffets are always quantity over quality- but Mandarin has many options to offer for appetizers, mains and desserts. The food isn't bad, but that doesn't make it good. I've tasted much better for a reasonable price. For those health conscious readers, healthy  options here are harder to come by. So make sure you do that extra work out.  Good for groups - pricing is meh ... Can be cheaper.   The decor has this nice appeal to it- Asian themed.  Somehow - I will make a trip here every year during Christmas time :)"}
{"text":"This is based upon a buffet lunch experience.  My husband laughed at me when I told him that I've never tried Mandarin.  He couldn't believe it.  So I decided to give it a try today.  The experience was what I expected. Great service at this location. The cooked food was mediocre. The dishes were too salty. Nothing really authentic.  The only item I thought was pretty unique and yummy was their vegetable fried bun. As for the sushi area, their nigiri presentation looked pretty bad. The salmon slices weren't evenly cut.  However, I do wanna mention than compared to a lot of other buffets, they do have quite a lot of different vegetarian sushi options.  My favorite was the sweet potatoe avocado sushi.  The dessert tables had a lot of selection. I was looking forward to the cotton candy they advertised on the website but apparently they don't have it yet for lunch which was disappointing.  They have a large selection of ice cream flavours which I think kids will enjoy.  Overall, would I go back again? Probably not. Do I regret going? Not really."}
{"text":"I'm stuffed. Like most buffets, quantity trumps quality but I find the food above average here. Good snow crab and they have lobster every now and then. Enjoyed the salad bar, 4 kinds of soup, steamed veggies, pepper steak, shrimp and many other items. No traditional Chinese food here, more North American style. Kudos to this place, some of the best service I ever experienced. The staff are incredibly friendly and the place is spotless. Ordered takeout here once and it was fast, hot and a great overall experience.  Also cool are the large fish tanks separating dinning areas in the restaurant."}
{"text":"My Chinese friends laugh at me, but I still like Mandarin.  This is probably my favourite location since it never seems as busy as more centrally located Mandarins (and it's closest to my house).  It's always very clean and the service is excellent. The buffet itself is replenished frequently, and I've enjoyed most of what I've tried here.   It's a bit pricey, but it's miles ahead of most cheaper Canadianized Chinese buffets, so you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant, we always come here to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and milestones.  It's a great value for the food options you get.  I feel like a kid each time I'm there as I indulge in cotton candy and chocolate dipped marshmallows on a stick!"}
{"text":"The staff here are excellent.  Always return to your table to clear plates away and re-fill water. Super clean and tidy facilities and the buffet tables were maintained well.  I didn't feel pressured to leave and I wasn't given a dirty look for eating plates upon plates of delicious spring roll sushi, bread, mashed potatoes, lemon meringue pie, noodles etc etc etc.  This was actually my first time at the Mandarin so I have nothing to compare it to but I would definitely want to return to this one as it wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"The place was nice and clean.  Price was high for a buffet.  About $27 . There is a large variety.  Most of the food is fried. The fruits were fresh and dweet. Service was very good. . Desserts were good . Chow me in and fried rice were both blan. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Servers are very nice but there is very little selection (there are a lot of the same dishes on either side of the table). The workers here stare you down and give you dusgusted looks whenever you go get food (and I take very little) Overall, a very uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"Mandarin Box Grove specifically does not disappoint! One of the best AYCE Buffets serving a variety of Chinese themed dishes.   PROS: Snow  Crab legs, when its that time of year for this special its a must! Enough crab for everyone. They do not hold back, refills after refills unlike some other buffets.  Food, Quality is always beyond my expectations of buffets and very consistent.  Service at Mandarin is exceptionally good, warm greetings one of the best if not the best.  Environment, is very clean and tidy, very sanitary from the food stations all the way to the restrooms!  CONS:  Price, especially during weekends and holidays when crab legs are around easily $30. May not be appealing for frequent trips however on special occasion Mandarin always delivers.  Sushi Stand only offers vegetarian style sushi, would love to see at least some spicy salmon maki   I have not tried any other Mandarin Locations except the Box Grove Mandarin, I cannot the same for the others.  A must go on special occasions and for those in the area."}
{"text":"I have never been any better buffet place than this one. This place is just amazing. The best service ever. Very clean. Even the washroom is spotless! Food is so fresh and delicious. I totally recommend it for any family events."}
{"text":"Woah, a revolving door. This place is fancy.   OMG the decorations look amazing, bonus points.  The food, I'm sorry, but it really doesn't work for Chinese people. Mandarin literally made Chinese food Westernized. It's not worth paying about $30 for all you can eat food that I can cook better at home myself for less than $10. I mean the variety is good, and awesome if you like Westernized Chinese food. Typical AYCE food, quantity over quality."}
{"text":"My bf and I went for dinner yesterday. The wait was not long. Service was amazing! Our server Jeff was very diligent in clearing our plates and refilling our drinks. Highly recommend for a quick buffet. They had upgraded certain selection. They even have cotton candy"}
{"text":"Wonderful service.  Everyone and I do mean EVERYONE greets and welcomes you.  The food is good too.  Just not as much as a variety as the location I had gone to in Vaughan last month.  But I enjoyed this location just as much.  A VERY friendly and comfortable atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've heard from many people that this is the place to go for special occasions. It was my first time to come here; it was a birthday celebration (not mine).   First impressions is the decor is way over the top with two man made waterfalls that drop down into two koi ponds, a frog fountain, fake bamboo poles and fake flowers everywhere, three or four HUGE fish tanks that form a wall between one of the dining areas and the buffet area. It feels like going to a Chinese grandma's house who loves to cram evey nook and cranny with decorative items. We Asians all have moms, aunts or grannies who like to hoard. I did appreciate the artistry it took to make the beautiful fruit carvings though.  A variety of choices when it comes to soups, salads, fresh fruit, hot Asian style entrees, fried food, saucy dishes, sushi, pizza & fries, stir fry meat and veggie station, even a roast beef cutting station.  At any AYCE buffet you sacrifice quality for quantity. The food was just ok but the meats were tender, veggies were not overcooked. The staff kept the serving platters clean and replenished, and the food was kept at a decent temperature without drying out. My favorite item was the chocolate dipped marshmallows that tasted home made YUM! My least favorite item was the sushi where they used sweet mushy bananas. Very reasonably priced at $16.99 (doesn't include drinks) for a weekday lunch.   Very cordial attentive staff who come by frequently enough to refill drinks and clear dirty plates. Great for large parties (ours was 21) and families but make sure to make reservations because they're really busy even during the weekday lunch rush."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of buffets because the quality of foods being served is questionable. However for the most part, Mandarin has always kept its presentation spot-on for being clean.  Out of all the Mandarins I've been to, this location seems less busy than some of the other locations that are crowded due the area.    In terms of food selections, they've got Chinese, Japanese, and a few choices for western foods. Most of all the food area is always kept clean regularly, and presentable! Their service is generic across the table (aka locations) calm, courteous, and always willing to go above and beyond your expectations.   overall experience was good.. I was impressed. :) Solid 4!"}
{"text":"Pretty packed with company lunch parties!  Nice service, food alright, free glass when you order their Christmas cocktail/mocktail.  Lots of dessert to choose from.  Unfortunately, didn't seem like they had a lot of main varieties.  Had some turkey, and chicken wings never go wrong."}
{"text":"I would say, it should be 3.5 but I'm giving it a 4 because service was really good.  The food is slightly above average.  However, I think they really should have more people looking after the dessert area.  I saw this little girl licked the ice-cream scoop and then put it back in the water tray. I don't blame her, she look as if she was 4 (not sure why the parents were not with her).  We came here for the lunch weekend buffet.  The food was fresh & service was friendly.  I would come back to this place."}
{"text":"Been to this location maybe 3 times already. Once you enter the restaurant, almost every single employee says Hi and welcomes you to Mandarin, once you walk by them.  Food was ok, but there were a few items I tried that I didn't really like. They had dim sum for Chinese New Year. I tried the Haw Gao (Shrimp Dumpling) and Siu Mai (Pork Dumpling), I liked the siu mai better, the haw gao shrimp was mushy. The honey garlic ribs were way too sweet for my taste.  I loved the potato shred salad, it had a slight crunch to it, which made an interesting texture. The prime rib was also very moist and tasty. The fried chicken wings were crispy & moist, which were yummy.  I also like the creme brulee it was nice crisp topping & very cream in the centre.  Will come back to try other stuff for sure."}
{"text":"It was a long wait time, but that was expected on a holiday afternoon.  Some of my favourite choices are: torpedo shrimp, the BBQ ribs and the bread pudding. None of the other dishes really fancy my taste buds. I have a hard time enjoying buffets but Mandarin does a good job at make their dishes flavourful. The staff are also accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Sure, we survived 2012 - but I'm going doing something here that might be a sign of the apocalypse: 3-stars for Chinese buffet... from a Chinese guy that hates Chinese buffets.  Okay - maybe I'm being soft.  But just say 'all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet' to most Chinese people and you will most likely receive a look of disgust.  Beyond just being 'inauthentic' (more on that later), it simply just sucks.  It's not like a western buffet, where you can have a salad bar and things like mashed potatoes or roasted chicken that keep well in heated trays (... barbarians...).  Most Chinese food translates poorly in this format.  So, even during my youth - when buffets were the greatest thing in the world to me - I avoid Chinese buffets.  I've been been to one that didn't suck.  Well - Mandarin doesn't suck.  It's more like a western buffet with a focus on Chinese food.  We were here for Christmas Day lunch and they had a lot of items with high turnover.  We had reservations (it being Christmas Day and all) and we were immediately seated ahead of the big lineup of people that didn't think ahead.  You have your typical western buffet items (salad bar, dessert bar, roast beef, chicken, pasta, steak, torpedo shrimp, etc) with a Chinese food section, sushi stand and some dim sum.  Overall, most of the items were pretty good.  As expected, there are a lot of faux-Cantonese items like egg foo yung, egg rolls and sweet & sour chicken balls (it was my first time having the latter two).  It wasn't bad.  Definitely inauthentic - but that in itself doesn't make it bad.  For what it's worth, the other Chinese items (i.e. har gow, siu mai, stir fried beans) are pretty close to the 'real' thing and pretty good.  It's comparable to a mid-level Vegas buffet.  Selection is good, turnover is high and food was inoffensive.  This might sound bad, but 'inoffensive' is probably the highest compliment you can give to a buffet.  Out of all the food I tried, nothing really sucked.  And that's all you're looking for when you're just having foodstuff at a buffet.  The only downside was the pricing.  On regular days, it's $12.99 for lunch - which is a fair price.  On weekends and holidays, they add another $5 to the price.  Sure, I understand supply and demand - but for a near 40% price increase, I believe turkey (which was dry) was the only thing they added to their holiday menu.  So as a buffet, this is actually a 4-star since Mandarin is pretty high in those terms - especially if you come here during the weekday.  But for $18/person on any other day than X-Mas, I rather order up a storm at an actual Chinese restaurant and leave equally stuffed.  However, Mandarin is pretty good for what it is."}
{"text":"With everybody's life being so busy these days, my family (including extended family and a couple of guests), decided to forgo all the planning, housecleaning, cooking, and housecleaning to go out for our Christmas dinner instead. Mandarin Restaurant offers enough variety to satisfy everyone's taste and desires.  No matter what else is on the menu, I can never resist having soup and salad. That's healthy, right? Okay, I threw a few chilled snow crab legs on the salad. I also threw a wonton in my Hot and Sour soup. Doesn't everybody do this?  My next stop was the Prime Rib with mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and corn. Yum! It was a bit too rare for my guest so I ended up eating her portion as well. Hmmm, that may not have been a great idea. I was getting full.  I was very selective with my next plate, sampling only a few things that really appealed to me. I was getting really stuffed but I needed to have some steamed crab legs! I should have skipped that last plate and extra piece of beef! I can't resist crab legs!  Dessert? Well, maybe just one piece of something...  I don't eat at Mandarin often, especially for dinner, but when I do, I usually stick to a small bowl of soup, small salad, prime rib, and crab legs. That's my surf and turf. On those points, they deliver.  On this night, we all left (very) stuffed and satisfied with the food and great service. I was stuffed to the point of being uncomfortable. It's a good thing we didn't have to clean up the mess and wash dishes. Yay! Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"NO LONGER SERVE CRAB! This is a heads up to the people that only go there for the crab. They no longer serve crab. I will not be coming back to Mandarin. I've been visiting for years strictly for the crab. Everything else just tastes like food court food to me. Have a great day!"}
{"text":"This review is for a weekday lunch.  I have not gone to a Mandarin for almost a decade, so I really don't know how this location compares to another Mandarin.  Comparing to other buffets, such as Dragon Pearl, Dragon Legend, even the former Wasabi, this Mandarin is pleasant.  The interior is roomy, clean.  The decoration is tacky.  I really like the high ceiling.  The food quality was average, but nevertheless it is authentic Chinese food.  For reference, an average Hong Kong tea cafe can cook as good as or better than the food here.    But then, one doesn't come to Mandarin for food quality, does one?  One comes for the selection.  And the selection is good, even for a weekday lunch.  If you like desserts, you are in heaven here.  Weekday lunch cost $16 for adult, which is not bad value considering the selection.  Children lunch is half priced, or $8. This is a super deal if your little ones eat as much as adults.  I know many who are."}
{"text":"Love this all you can eat buffet.  I have been here a few times and each time I was impressed by the wonderful service and super friendly staff (even better than the other Markham location on Woodbine Ave).  This is in a newer area and therefore it is not crowded and very clean.   Mandarin is typically more expensive than other AYCE style buffets.  But you get what you pay for.  Quality is consistent with food matching the theme (eg. moon cake during mid-autumn festival).  However it doesn't have as much authentic chinese food (eg. dim sum, soya beancurd pudding) and is more westernized with deep fried chicken wings, chow mein, corn and mash potatoes.  Also not as big selection as other large AYCE buffets (eg. China Buffet King in Richmond Hill many years ago before they closed down).  Overall, this is my favourite Mandarin location so far.  Beautiful decor.  Service is always excellent.  Food is fresh and well presented.  Definitely a wonderful buffet to bring your friends/coworkers."}
{"text":"Impressed from beginning to end. Made reservations for 7:45pm during the weekend for Mothers Day. We got there a bit early and there was a massive line up. Right when the clock struck 7:45 we got our table. Excellent timing. The lady that greeted us and directed us to our table was all smiles and super polite informing us its not usually this busy and apologized that we had to wait even though we were early.   The food is excellent for an AYCE. In the appetizer section I liked the shrimp cocktails the best. They were large shelled shrimps and tasted very good with the cocktail sauce. Some other items that stood out for me were the crab legs and the salmon sashimi. The crab legs were quite large and pre-cracked for you so it was surprisingly easy to get at the meat. I must have eaten 8 crab legs myself. The salmon sashimi were fresh and thickly sliced and were always available. You can actually grab the sashimi yourself unlike other places where a server gives them to you.   In the dessert section my favourites were the creme brule and the chocolate covered strawberries. I went back for more strawberries but they were all gone. They tasted that good.   In the ice cream section there was the yogurt ice cream which comes out of a machine and your standard bucket ice creams. I liked how there was melted chocolate syrup as an added topping.   Another thing that impressed me was the service. Whenever I came back with a new plate of food, my old dirty plate was already gone.   The place is also kept very clean in the food section and I saw a worker replacing all the tongs in the middle of the night to keep things extra clean.  I have been to Mandarin before but never at this level of quality. There must have been some change in ownership or something because its much better than before.   Price was a bit high for $28.99 a person but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Usually come here for AYCE snow crab legs in the evening weekend. That is good but everything else is good, not great. Service is good, food is replenished quickly. Wish the mango salad wasn't that spicy, would eat more if it wasn't that spicy.  Huge dessert section."}
{"text":"This is the Mandarin of Mandarins.  If you like Canadian-Chinese buffet then you'll love Mandarin.  And if you love Mandarin you'll love this location.  I'd like to make my way back to this oen again.  But be warned, it's a tad bit pricier."}
{"text":"May 22 Sunday night dinner review   I like AYCE places, I've been to quite a few such as dragon pearl, etc.  Mandarin is usually not at the top of my list.  For my dads birthday, we decided to come here. Its Sunday long weekend, so we booked a reservation for 4:30pm when they open, to avoid long line ups inside.  We asked for a table closer to the entrance of the room, rather than at the back of the room, so my dad who uses a cane, does not have to navigate around tables and chairs to get back to the table.  Of course when we get there, they point to a table at the back of the room! I'm like... ok here we go with problem #1.  After that, it was all good.  Service is excellent!! Food selection is not bad. Luckily the place was not packed, so no crazy line ups. Lots of selection!! Atmosphere is nice and relaxing with huge wall fish tanks to look at.  Sushi selection is not bad. Ice cream section for the kids, dessert tables looked good.  For a birthday celebration, they come and take a picture of your group, and print it out for you. They put it in a magnetic sleeve.  And birthday boy/girl/DaD/MoM gets a slice of bday cake with candle!!  This was a nice surprise!!  You do need to sign up and print out a birthday coupon from their website.  I would have gave this experience a 5 star, if they gave us a closer table as we requested.  Lots of parking!  Never had to ask for water refill, and they come around to clear plates pretty quick.  Also, they never told us that there was a time limit or that we had until a certain time. They never tried to rush us. Maybe because it was not busy...  I know the downtown location, gives your the bill as a hint.  Overall happy with experience. I'm still stuffed while writing this review. :)"}
{"text":"Everyone knows the Mandarin!  I've been to this location a number of times and I'm generally pretty happy.  The food is generally very good and they re-stock any trays that are empty pretty quickly.  See something empty?  Go back in a few minutes and it should be there.  They have a ton of employees always keeping watch of what needs to be re-stocked or cleaned and with the amount of people that are always here, it's highly appreciated.  Only oddity is that once, my girlfriend noticed the bunch of crab legs she got was a slightly underdone, but the next batch she got was much better so she was happy.  The service is generally pretty good.  The waiters and waitresses usually check up on you fairly often, mostly to check if you need a drink re-fill and they're usually really nice (I had one instance where they were ridiculously slow with bringing drinks and clearing old plates though).  The owner / manager usually introduces themselves too.  You'll want to make a reservation if you're going anywhere between 6 and 7pm on any given night, just so you aren't waiting.  The take-out counter's pretty efficient in that you're in and out of there quickly.  Parking's also very plentiful and you shouldn't have an issue as long as you aren't one of those people that 'must' park right in front.  My only minor gripe is the way they place the tables.  Sometimes they place or move another person's table in a way that makes it a little hard for you to walk through the room, especially if you need to get around people who are seated.  It's a problem with some rooms more than others.  One weird fact is that they use those plastic fold out tables.  They look pretty sturdy so I hope they monitor their condition.  All in all, you can't go wrong with the Mandarin at this location.  I'm really not a fan of the Woodbine location because it's usually a lot busier with less parking.  So go to this location if you have a choice."}
{"text":"Very clean, courteous and professional. The staff have this odd way of appearing and disappearing like a ripple in a pond.  Atmosphere is very calm and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Ok take out  I came in and went to take out.  Order some dishes.    Brought it home it was a bit cold but that normal.    Location order:  The music was too loud for simple conversation.  It made it hard to talk and listen to the staff.   I was ordering where the staff clock in.     Staff:  This is how they got the one staff.  Staff were nice and very friendly.   Confirmed the order even offices my a drink when I waited for free.   Good for the staff.    FOOD Nice bag the package was very nice.  The rice was WAy too SALTY.   To the point it was not good.  The price for the food was ok for what I got.    The parking lot for when I arrived very nice and free.    Over all not sure about going back unless they did not add salt."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is nice! Food tasted better on other times as it wasn't busy today. Ambiance was nice and restaurant was clean. Turkey pot pie on NY day which was tasty. Will be back as it's a good all you can eat restaurant with a variation of dessert and ice cream."}
{"text":"this place is very slow. They don't refill or make any thing fresh later in the night. If you go after 7 pm you will endup eating the left over . We went last week for a birthday Dinner and very Dissapointed with the quality ."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my family and this Mandarin confused me a great deal.  First off, it was weird seeing a Mandarin not packed with long lines outside during a holiday weekend.  In fact, the place was half empty.  The food here split into 2 categories: Crab legs ... and then everything else.  The good: 1. The crab legs were surprisingly small.  2. The sashimi/sushi here are starting to be passably authentic.  3. I loved the peking duck and turkey dish for Thanksgiving. 4. The pineapples (for the first time in forever was sweet) at the salad bar  The bad: 1. HOW WAS THERE NO BREAD AT THE BREAD STATION?!  I walked by here several times and there were your usual rolls but the sliced bread was demolished.   2. The dessert place was falling behind as it got later and later into the night.  Everything started becoming half empty: especially the waffles ): and the cook was too busy to use both griddles at once.  Everything else was your usual \"Chinese\" (westernized) food as per the Mandarin quality - not bad but not brag worthy.  My service was excellent.  We got Joe as our server and there was never a time we couldn't find him when we needed him.  He refilled drinks and napkins constantly without being asked.    I loved how the manager came out to greet the tables and inquired about satisfaction.  I think the only other thing I have against this table is that the servers that come out to refill the pans in the buffet tend to walk backwards and talk to others who are still on the floor.  Almost caused me spill everything on their heads a couple of times.  I'll be back when I'm craving crab legs again."}
{"text":"I love this location and i am a huge fan of AYCE places, so I am a regular here. We usually arrive when lunch starts or dinner starts. It's the best time to be there because everything is being brought out while we are there. This ensures fresh & warm food. They have a lot of options and i love that they have a great selection for kids. Service is always great and servers always make you feel welcome and they really stay on top of clearing the tables, topping up water & drink refills."}
{"text":"2018-02-17. Mandarin is an AYCE franchise restaurant serving Chinese, Japanese, and Canadian dishes. The restaurants have the same Chinese themed decor with a pond filled with Poi near the entrance (a feng shui thing). The dining area is sectioned off, a system consistent at all locations to provide semi seclusion to accommodate larger party bookings, corporate functions, and the like. Linens line the tables, but the warm lighting adds little to the ambiance as it's crashed by the higher noise levels.  Servers clear tables and take care of drinks, otherwise, it's self service. Their buffet is extensive offering well over 100 items, covering appetizers to desserts. Weekends usually have premium offerings like crab or lobster, but prices are also adjusted for it. Prices for weekdays are the upper end of $$, weekends are on the lower end of $$$. Unlike the Korean and Japanese AYCE places, Mandarin doesn't hold you to a maximum 2-hour booking. They do accept reservations, and every location fills up during dinner hours, so it would be prudent to make one if you have a part of 5 or more.  While there are some mainstay dishes, it's difficult to rate the food as it changes. All the items are labelled and provide a calorie reference in case you're concerned about how much you're consuming. While I like this, I find irony in it. If you're concerned about caloric intake, you should not be dining at AYCE. If on the other hand, you came to pay the exorbitant prices because you want the variety vs the quantity, then you don't need or care for the info. Maybe it's all just a Jedi mind trick to plant some subliminal message in your sub-conscious that will trigger you to think you're full? Nah, I'm sure it's just FYI...  In general I'm not a fan of AYCE Chinese, but the place was designed to accommodate larger groups, and we had 18 in our party. If you want to know the type of dishes they serve, see my pics (there'll be a lot of them!). I only rated the things I've tried.  Overall, it's not a bad place. There's enough variety here to satisfy everyone. While I've not had anything spectacular, I've also experienced much worse at other restaurants. I will give them one thing though, they're the only place I know if that makes Chinese Choux Profiteroles, one of my favourite desserts of all time since childhood. Are they worth the 30 bucks for admission?... Sometimes ;-) ... 3,5 stars.  If you would like to experience more, come dine-with-me.yelp.com I'd love to have your company... Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Came here for Thanksgiving lunch yesterday w/ my family. I must say, this is by far the best Mandarin I have been to. The staff are super kind, always smiling/asking if you need anything. The food was really good! The chefs constantly made fresh food (which is a plus). Also, they served turkey, roast beef, mashed potatoes, etc., as a Thanksgiving special.   One downside would be that the waiters tend to take your plate away quick, without asking if your done. My cousin literally bent over to get her phone from the floor and the waitress took her plate without asking if she was done. When something like this happens, it just seems like their rushing you out. Can't lie, it was pretty funny and we were all laughing, but other than that, def. will be back!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet & box grove location is one of my favourites. Clean, great staff and service!  Went for the Alaskan crab & it was fresh, delicious & they kept on refilling all night.  I've been at this location many many times & they have the best hosts, waiters and waitresses!!"}
{"text":"Honestly for a MANDARIN BUFFET, this place is pretty good. Clean, friendly staff, very accompanying and acommendating. They fill up your water so quickly here and that's something I won't forget. Service wise 9/10.   Food however it's okay. Average for a buffet and average for their brand.   Under seasoned is the main staple of what I sense here, that being said its actually quite a plus! You can always add salt but you can't take out salt.   Overall not bad. Not great."}
