{"text":"A good break from fast-food. This restaurant has friendly and fast service. The food is not exceptional but is good enough for a hole-in-the-wall style diner. I have not had lunch and likely will not (menu didn't look very appetizing), their breakfast was good enough and my family and I all enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"My son and I visited there this sun morn , atmosphere was nice ppl were nice waitress super nice and kept my drink full ! My son had the jr meal of two pancakes , eggs and sausage , I had two eggs hashbrowns sausage and biscuits and gravy ~ cldnt decide . so I got alil of few things  Everything was Great , portions were awesome , even had to bring home the leftovers .  Menu had several things to choose from . Will be going back there.  OPEN 24 hrs !"}
{"text":"Omg i was sceptical about comeing here ive live in the area for about 5 yrs now n never been. At first i thought it was like fried food this is better than the waffle house and my waitress was great food 5 stars.  I was served pretty fast!!  Definitely goung back!!!"}
{"text":"This was a bad experience all around.  I went on a Wednesday morning when it was really slow and still the service was bad.  The waitresses were busy complaining to each other out-loud about their personal life and airing their dirty laundry.  I'm assuming they don't assign servers to certain sections because they debated who was going to take my order.  This made me feel very appreciated of course... except for no.  After I got my meal, they never asked if I needed anything, not even a coffee refill.  Then they just gave me the bill and still didn't ask if I needed anything else.  If they put as much thought into their jobs as they do the number of tattoos they have, things might have been great.

As for the food, I would rate the Bacon and eggs at 2 stars.  I would give the pancakes 1 star because they were chewy and hard to cut into.

What's worse is that the food was WAY overpriced.  Coffee, Bacon and eggs, plus one pancake, came to around $13.  I believe this place is part of a local chain.  Even so, I will never return to this place or any of their other locations if the management can be this clueless about how their place runs."}
{"text":"I had time to kill before work and I was hungry so I came here . BIG MISTAKE ! I took my wife and 4 yr old ( I apologized  to them after ) . We were told to sit wherever we wanted to , and it seemed like we got a dirty look ? Wifey got biscuits and gravy 2 eggs 2 sausage links . I ordered chicken and waffles with all dark meat...simple right ?.......Nope ! Her portion was huge AND half cold (eggs and sausage)....I got my order @ 5 min later after listening to the waitress yell at the cook that it was supposed to be all dark meat...she comes to me and asks \" Can I bring you two legs right now and have him make a thigh for you \" . \" Sure \" I tell her , 10 minutes later I get the.. chicken thigh ? Anyways I take the first bite ..it's okay :\..bite number 2..   :O FROZEN CHICKEN...UUUUUUGGGGHHHH!......the fuxin waitress tells me she will take $3 off the bill...THREE FRIGGIN BUCKS !! Are you F'n kidding me..she should have taken the meal off of the bill..There were also other customers who were NOT happy with their food . I DO NOT SUGGEST THIS PLACE AT ALL..So if you do go , and get the awesome service we did ... remember..I TOLD YOU SO !"}
{"text":"Service was awesome. My family enjoyed their food. I had got the Biscuit & gravy with hash browns. The biscuit was okay but the gravy was delicious. The hash brown was my favorite,It like melt in your mouth! Very delicious! (:"}
{"text":"Upon entering  the diner I was greeted promptly but off to a bad start the first server  wiped down  a table to seat me and left it wet when I asked her to dry it she had a fit a bad move my stomach  turned I asked for a different  server she almost refused but I insisted. The Second  server was friendly  and provided excellent service Ashley  is a Ten."}
{"text":"I went to the one on Bethany home in Phoenix
I read all the reviews and was hesitant to go but my boyfriend insisted that it was good so I went.

It really was very good!

I got a salad with thousand island which i never do because the waitress said that the thousand island was really good. I also got a chicken fried steak which was everything it should be. 

I have to add that the waitress was just about the best waitress I have had anywhere. She smiled the whole time and was super nice."}
{"text":"Love the food very good and well done. Wait staff is super awesome as well. Definitely my breakfast go to."}
{"text":"Large portions and great food! left there stuffed! The prices are good also!  On my list of places I will return to...great biscuits just like down south!"}
{"text":"No fresh food here, everything was previously frozen.  My husband and I ate here for the 1st time today and it will be our last.  The fish was greasy, the vegetables were from a frozen bag, the fruit was from a can, the buscuits were cold and had flour sprinkled on top to \"appear\" homemade. Also, I've never been to a country restaurant that doesn't serve sweet tea....a country staple."}
{"text":"Stopped to have dinner here. Was hoping it was going to be good. We sat at the counter and when we placed our order, the cook in the kitchen rolled his eyes and shook his head. That wasn't a good start. Then the lady sitting next to us got her order and she had a big horsefly dead in the middle of her eggs. We got up and walked out. The white dress was very nice, but I would not eat here."}
{"text":"This is the classic go-to American restaurant. I love coming here for breakfast. Everything tastes just the way you would expect. The service is fast and friendly. The prices are very good. The restaurant always has plenty of room to sit, which is great when I come here starving and don't want to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"We had an advertisement in a recent mailer and thought we would go out of our way to visit a business that was a village Inn pizza parlor that worked in during high school.  I found our server, Ashley, to be wonderful.  The food was fresh and hot.  We enjoyed the all you can eat fish fry and were able to use our coupon.  What a great value.  Needless to say, the building has seen better days, the food and value made the lack of ambiance A non issue.  Thanks Ashley for the great service."}
{"text":"I came here when I first moved to central phoenix & it was very friendly.  I've experienced thatmo exact same behavior.  It's an old school restaurant.  Waitress remembered me from weeks ago when I came through.  They have specials for all meals of the day starting at $3.99."}
{"text":"Me and my husband just ate here and we both were very disappointed. 
We ordered breakfast and it was so bland, I literally had to dump tobasco sauce on it just to keep it down. Not to mention a grip of fly's flying around. We will never eat here again. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"I like coming here because they give out great two for one coupons! The food is average, but it's breakfast, what more would you expect from a meal you can easily prepare your self! The service is always the same, happy waitresses that understand what it's like to work hard and know that your just hungry and want a no BS meal.  I come here about twice a month and enjoy it every time."}
{"text":"Have had many meals here breakfast being my fav. always good honest food. It's not fancy its just good.
I have recommended this place to many friends, none have been disappointed.
I do miss the vetrans discount however. Still don't understand why it was dropped."}
{"text":"I really hate giving bad reviews but between the disgusting floater in the restroom, the view of a bum outside my window, and the food that seemed to all come out of a can or a package, there was no getting around giving a 2 star review. I'm all about checking out hole-in-the walls and mom-n- pops shops, you can find some great gems out there, but this not one of them. It's also odd that you think your going o eat a \"country\" breakfast, and you see egg rolls on the menu. 
I will however, give props to our sweet waitress who was very nice and gave great service. :) other than that- the experience was not so nice"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while for breakfasts. Reasonably priced breakfasts. Very friendly staff. I recommend it. It's a greasy spoon, so don't expect fresh delicious food. The food is good. The people complaining are just uppity people that need to go back to their own state."}
{"text":"I don't believe the snobby put-down reviews people are giving this place, and anyone who complains about their prices being high must be making a joke! I have to take issue with Kathryn M. who sneers that this is a \"typical\" diner. There are precious few independent diners (typical or atypical) in the whole state of Arizona, which is bloated with overpriced chain restaurants (Dennys, IHOP, etc.) with high prices and lousy service for the touristas. This is a Great American Diner with a super-friendly attitude that serves EVERYONE, from blue-blooded royalty to the scum of the earth, with the same respect and good cheer. As one of the deplorables who frequents this place and LOVES the food, I had to laugh at Kathryn's comments about the kind of people who eat here. I have a Ph.D. and work in the corporate world, but it's nice to have a casual place like this where I don't have to worry about how I'm dressed. I had the Eggs Benedict today with homemade Egg Rolls and loved every bit of it. Long live the Country Boys Restaurants!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, fairly cheap.  Service was nice and it was a very laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was good, but weirdest dining experience ever. A man came in asking for water and then he made a scene because the server politely asked him to leave. It isn't the safest of areas in the valley, so sometimes people come in from off the street, but it did seem like it could have turned volatile quickly. I'd suggest trying a different location :/"}
{"text":"The map is incorrect.  This countryboy is east of 17.     Now for review.    I normally go to Greenway location and like it.   This one on Bethany was not so good.   Waitress was nice friendly and fast.    Food, compared to Greenway, was bad.    I had a chef salad that was sort of wilted.  It was like the lettuce was the last day it could be used.    The dressing was watery not like the dressing used in the Greenway location. I had to send it back.  Then we wanted to use the buy one entree get the second free coupon and the waitress informs me the owner says you have to buy a drink with the meal inorder to use it.   I only drink water with my meal but ok i ordered a soda which i didnt drink.   After i got my wilted salad, watery dressing, and drink that i didnt want im thinking this owner seems a bit of a cheapskate and you know im convinced of it. I start looking around and notice the hot sauce bottle.  I pick it up and shake it.  Im sure its been watered down.  How pathetic. If your losing money, close the place.  Don't make it worse by watering everything down and nickel and diming people by insisting they order a drink to use the coupon.  The other locations dont require that. Too be fair maybe i was mistaken about the watering down but I doubt it.   I will never ever go back there.    Cheap cheap management"}
{"text":"When I walked in the staff was very nice and pleasant. I started out with a cup of coffee that seemed watered down, just not much flavor to it. I ordered the 4 strips of bacon with hashbrowns scrambled eggs and biscuits and gravy. The only good thing I ate was the eggs and bacon. The hashbrowns were mushy inside like mashed potatoes. The food was over priced too. I would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Always come here when I'm on this side of town, for breakfast. They always have great specials and have a deal going on! I had the breakfast burger special today and the fries were on point, the beef was juicy and cooked well! On the outside it looks a little run down how ever the food is good. My waitress today was a bit rough in the beginning with serve but she warmed up and in the end was more nice. Last time I was here the serve was not great and maybe because the waitress at the time pulled a double. There are always regulars!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy.  Good food and service & good value.  Excellent biscuit & gravy"}
{"text":"Enjoy this place on Saturday mornings. The waitresses are always friendly and get to know you so they can be quick on their feet with their orders. Like the fact you can sit yourself anywhere and are quickly addressed by a waitress in no time. Given the various rushes with this place, they still do a great job getting our food out while still taking the time to explain the menu and order options. Country Boys even gives you coupons when you leave their restaraunt for your next visit so that you can save on future orders. Definitely give it a shot"}
{"text":"Best cheap eats in Phoenix. Great crew, great regulars and family friendly. The breakfast burger is one of the most well put together monster burgers in town and won't break your wallet."}
{"text":"I have always liked Country Boys not much to look at but they serve homestyle cooking at a reasonable price. The waitresses are friendly and they honor entertainment book and also have there own coupons if you ask. The portions are large and if you want comfort food it's better than Denny's."}
{"text":"The mediocrity of this restaurant is frightening. I usually order something breakfast at a new place if I can since it's usually near impossible to screw it up. Well this place found a way. 
Everything was bland or cooked wrong. EVERYTHING. Eggs were bland, hash browns damn near raw, pancakes tasted off, and even the meats were barely warm and not very tasty. The most interesting part of the gravy was the salt and pepper we added so we could taste something. Anything!!! 
$30 for a breakfast we didn't eat. There are too many other great breakfast joints in town. Save yourself and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Great people here and food is fresh and hot!  Taste is like homemade!  My son got grilled cheese and fries and they brought all the food out together so no one had to wait.  Always made sure we had full glasses!"}
{"text":"Country Boys Restaurant @ 2330 W. Camelback Rd. Phoenix AZ, 85015

When we tried to use printed online coupon, for buy one get one, we were told we had to buy 2 beverages.  Usually when places pull this, we just leave.  But since it was close to the center where I had just had eye surgery and had no coffee that morning we decided to stay and have coffee with our meal.  Then we proceeded to order steak and eggs and were then told coupon wasn't good for steak and eggs.  BYW...none of these stipulations were printed on the coupon.  Waitress tried to talk us into a 3.99 or 4.99 breakfast deal and we said no since we wanted steak and eggs.  We told her that other Country Boy's on Greenway accepts coupon for steak and eggs and we didn't have to buy any drinks.  She said that is because it has a different owner.  This place shoots themselves in the foot and will lose lots of business by pulling the old bait and switch; not only once, but twice.  We will never go back to that location.  Don't they realize there are hundreds of other places to eat (including those not affiliated with entertainment.com)?  And that is what we did.  We went to KISS THE COOK in Glendale and had steak and eggs with another coupon and had a much better atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great spot for breakfast, make your way over to Country Boys Restaurant.  The staff was very polite and paid very close to us during our entire visit.  I got a sausage and bacon omelette with pancakes and hashbrowns.  The amount and quality of food you receive your money will make you never want to visit a Denny's or IHOP again. Plus, half the wait on a Sunday morning.  I will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast specials around! Very reasonable for big portions of yummy breakfast food. Friendly waitresses. Everything youd hope for in a little diner.
Have frequented, will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and Coffee was great!!! Food was good, nothing out of the ordinary. I had biscuits and gravy.  Biscuits were very good and fresh and gravy was tasty.  Everything was good until the place filled up and kitchen got busy.  You could hear the pots and pans banging, waiters talking, well place got extremly loud!! But I guess that happens with small restaurants. I think next time I'll just have take our instead."}
{"text":"I LOVE Country Boys.  I have been to 2 locations in the past and had top notch service with large portions are fair prices.  This is the third and worst location.  The service was terrible.  Food was cold. It took 30 minutes just to get our waters. And the saddest part is there were only a few people here when we got here.  There was Green specks all over my pancakes.  Won't be back.  Not even if the food is free."}
{"text":"Sure, one can build a breakfast here for $3.99 plus drink and tax. But if you leave an absolutely disgustingly filthy A-frame sign in the dining area, it makes me question the cleanliness standards around the rest of this place. I had horrible service the first time. (Although food arrived quickly after I was finally able to order) You have to actually flag a server down to get a refill. And they must not want anyone to leave as they pulled our plates a half hour ago and still can't get my bill. A $3.99 breakfast just isn't work the complete inattention of the staff here."}
{"text":"Cannot be beaten for the price.  They have a specials menu where you can get a very decent breakfast for 3 bucks !  I had the Chicken Fried Steak, mashed potatoes, and green beans with soup.  Potatoes were not out of a box !  Sausage gravy was great !  Looking for a great place with cheap prices, this is it."}
{"text":"Great all-American breakfast, large portions and good value for money.  Very busy Sunday morning but service was attentive and staff were cheerful and seemed happy to be working there."}
{"text":"Great home style food. Good service. Reasonable prices. Country fried steaks. Meatloaf. Usually I order a big breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was good. We ordered the Pancakes & Breakfast Sandwish."}
{"text":"Waitress was great and attentive! Food was okay, kind of cold. Prices were cheap and portions were big. I definitely recommend this place for a cheap and hearty breakfast."}
{"text":"HUGE portions.  If you're craving breakfast, this place would be a good nearby choice."}
{"text":"This is my 4th time here the service is always been very good and polite . The food is very good I have only had lunch once the rest has been breakfast what prompted the post is how clean they keep the place and when they clear off the table they actually wash it unlike many restaurants. I will continue coming in"}
{"text":"Perfect diner food! Big portions, home cooked meals and amazing waitresses! Try the jersey fries instead of hash browns! Seriously, one of the nicest waitresses I have ever had here! Better than the other Country boys a few miles away."}
{"text":"Very yummy food, quick and super friendly service, and decent prices. The building itself needs a little up do. But I consider it one of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"No repeat visit here.  Service was bad and took too long to get our food.  When we got the check it had a total but didn't show how she got the total.  I still think she ripped me off.

Food was ok but not good enought to make up for the bad service."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I like to relax and have my brunch. My favorite bis Spinach Cheese omelette."}
{"text":"Food was hot, well seasoned, and perfectly cooked. Service was great, I will definatly be back for more."}
{"text":"This place just opened a while back in the building left vacant for a while when Streets of New York left.  It is a 24 hour diner with all the normal menu items.  I like what they did with the place brightening it up and adding a small counter.  I did not go out there but I think they kept the patio dining too.

I had a sourdough burger and an insanely huge amount of fries.  It was pretty good.  Like all their burgers it came with the veggies on the side but the burger was sealed shut with the melted cheese and grilled onions so I ate them as a salad.  I was at the counter and service was pretty good, a touch cocky which fit the atmosphere.  Prices were reasonable but like all the Country Boys they have coupons they hand out when you pay for BOGO that do not have expiration dates on them."}
{"text":"First time here and I can say that the service was excellent, the restaurant filled with locals and nice staff. I got the French toast with eggs, hash brown and sausage; the food wasn't half bad but the hash browns were more like a baked potato spread on the plate. But my biggest complaint is that they charge you for STRAWS!!!"}
{"text":"We're always trying to support local businesses and were looking for a diner in which our family could have a variety of food choices at a great price. As a former server, I use my sense of smell when we walk in the door to any restaurant that we're trying for the first time & they passed the test. We received excellent service and enjoyed good comfort food at the 43rd Ave & Bethany location. With our breakfasts, we ordered our eggs Up and OM, both of which were cooked to perfection. The food came out fast, hot and fresh. We will definitely choose this old school diner over Denny's any day. Mom, Dad & Kid tested, all approved."}
{"text":"Great service, attentive to the customer.  Large generous portions.  Great mom & pop restaurant.  Prime Rib is outstanding."}
{"text":"Country Boys is a pretty decent breakfast joint. Their food is good (certainly better than your average Denny's faire) and the service was very good.

They only had one girl waiting tables and running payments, and she did very well despite having no help. Especially for our large party of 8.

The prices are meh, and the place is a little run down. But the food was good enough. My advice to the ownership is fix it up a little bit, I mean it really really needs some love.

I wouldn't rush to go back but I wouldn't object to the idea either."}
{"text":"I come here ever time I get my oil changed across the street. They are always very nice. The food is good, and prices aren't bad."}
{"text":"I been wanting to taste this place for a long time. I didn't go inside but we ordered pick up. It was so not tasty. My hash browns tasted so old and plain. My pancakes were not homemade pancakes. You can tell they just heated them up. They tasted like rubber. I will not be going again."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure there's no better breakfast place in town. Been here twice and they know how to cook an egg perfectly. 

The have a breakfast special that cannot be beat: 2 eggs, any style, bacon or sausage, toast or pancakes, hashed browns-$3.99. 

That's not a misprint: $3.99!  

Go there now!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat owner is great as are server and cooks u can't beat the f00d or cost..."}
{"text":"These people are CROOKS!!!

We had an Entertainment coupon and when the waitress saw it she told me there was a 2 drink requirement. I asked her where does it say that on the coupon or anywhere in the restaurant for that matter. She read the coupon and got that stupid look on her face that CRIMINALS always get when caught and said it was a company policy. I said call the manager. She refused. I said call the police because she was trying to defraud us out of money with a bait and switch tactic. She refused to do that also.
We have used the same coupon before and didn't have any problem.
I don't think I have ever written a \"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH\" review before, but these people deserve it.

We left and went to Ollie's Diner 5166 W Olive Ave.

Better food, better service, better ambiance, better seating and honest people.

 Just a Note 1/7/2018
For your review of: Country Boys Restaurants

Don't forget the part where you threatened to punch the waitress in the face. Nice guy.

Obviously these people aren't just criminals, but liars also.

You probably are the crook who waited on us. Took you long enough to reply.

I never threaten people. If they need punching in the face I just do it.

Why didn't you call the police?

You're a liar."}
{"text":"$4.99 breakfast, fast and tasty. Wait staff was welcoming. Restaurant is clean and booths are comfy. Kept the coffee cups full, thank you. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We always do take out here- We call in the same order. 2 Big country breakfast with hashbrowns.  We get 3 eggs any style, ham, bacon and sausage. Biscuits and gravy and pancakes. 2 giants breakfast for $20- Can't beat it."}
{"text":"I came in this morning and ordered some food. The food was great but the service could be better. I asked for a refill on a cup of coffee and  they said they would bring it out. 5 minutes later they haven't brought me the refill. I asked 4 different people but it seemed like they forgot about my table. After waiting a while I yelled out that I need a refill and they finally brought it."}
{"text":"Perhaps one of my favorite spots to venture for breakfast. This morning's visit was perhaps a little different this my normal visit but it won't keep me from not coming back. 

The kiddo orders the Cheeseburger Club with fries and he gobbled it down...he's not a picky eater.

The mother-in-law wants a fruit bowl, but they don't have any fresh fruit so she settled for the pineapple which is really tasty!

The husband orders a Ham and Cheese Melt with fries and it to is pretty tasty.

I on the other hand wanted something different so I opted for the All you can eat Catfish. I am pretty sure that it was cod, I settled for fries as their hot vegetable was not ready for the day. I can understand because it was 8am in the morning...and who orders dinner for breakfast...but our family.

Service was fast and friend...but the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"The food is plentiful and delicious.  I can't say there is any ambience but if that is not important to you (it's not to me) I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  The fact that you can mess up eggs, bacon, and sausage is very surprising.  Everything was very bland.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I was a little reluctant when I entered to see a huge crane machine stuffed with plush toys along with a few small TV's scattered through this cluttered diner but the Yelp reviews helped me try this place. My goal was to try their All You Can Eat Friday Fish Fry but changed my mind when I found out they use Catfish. I am not a fan of Catfish but it did look tasty on the table next to me. I opted for their Big Breakfast which had 3 eggs, which were scrambled the way I enjoy, 2 slices of bacon, two sausage links, a slice of processed Ham, Hash Browns cooked to crispy perfection, 2 pancakes and Biscuit with gravy. A lot of food! My only complaint was the gravy on the homemade biscuit seemed to be from a package and tasteless. If I try this again I would order the gravy on the side where I could add seasonings and the sausage links for flavor or just eat the biscuits with butter and jam. I will go again to try more of the menu. The table next to me had a Western Cheeseburger that looked tempting."}
{"text":"I would have loved to give this place 5 stars as the food was great & the Service was not too bad. But I had a bad experience there last Sunday. We went in for Brunch. Before we got there i called them & said i had a Groupon For the restaurant on Greenway & If They would honor it. I was not sure, as the Groupon said Country Boys Greenway. But the Girl Who answered said, they would honor it & to come over. We said we would be there in 10 minutes.
We had never been to this location before. But we went to a Church on Bethany Home & this was closer than Driving to Greenway & I was so very Hungry.
We were not too happy with the look from the outside, but thought we will go in as we were there now. The Girls there were nice & got us seated in no time & drinks & food came out on time. Everything was good, until we had to pay the bill & gave the Groupon. She come back saying they don't accept it. My Husband mentioned that we had called & were told that it will be honored. Then she says, it was the new girl who spoke to us & she didn't know & that she just left. 
One thing I hate is to have a meal & then have an issue about the bill. Paying the total was no big deal. But My Groupon Expires in a week & I will loose it, if I don't use it. That was the only reason we picked this restaurant to go to Last Sunday. Then they called the Manager, who said she didn't know what to say to us. I was very upset at the way this was handled & the way they just couldn't be bothered to even check on it. They said there was nothing they could do. They Gave me the owners number. POE is the Owner. I have tried calling, but there's no answer.
I totally get it, that they might have no way of accepting a Groupon that was for another location. But if your staff said that we could come over & that they will accept it, just 10 minutes before, then you should honor it & stand by what you said. It is not fair to penalize a Customer, who didn't just show up & sit there with a Groupon, but did call ahead to check. We even showed them our call log & one of the girls remembered the call.
If the girl who answered was new, she should be told that she has to check with her Manager on certain things. She should have known to ask us to hold on till she checks either with the Manager, or Senior staff. It is not like they are far away & not reachable. They all work behind that Counter.
Most of the servers are seated with the Customers in their booths & chatting with the Customers. I guess they are regulars. Or they are giggling & chatting & planning out their lunch. All that is ok & not my concern, but you should be pay attention, before you reply to a Customer. They promised to ask Someone to call us, but today is Wednesday & no one has called us or spoken to us yet.
Lovely Food, But Sadly, I wouldn't want to have issues after a nice meal with Family."}
{"text":"I came here after spending some quality time at the Dealership across the street.  This place is kinda homely.   I ate breakfast, and had a skillet.  mm.  it was tasty.  

This place is nothing fancy.  Prices are reasonable.  I enjoyed my time here!"}
{"text":"Certainly decent place.

This place recently opened and its a 24 hour diner.  
This is a little Mom and Pop Cafe type feel. Reminds me of TTT in Tucson. 

The waitress was working by herself and there were about 4 other parties in there but it didn't stop her from paying attention to our party of 8. She did really well.

The food was good, it was diner quality. Nothing amazing but it was decent.

Certainly worth the stop if you are looking for a cheap, good meal. 
However do not mistake the quality of food for 5 star."}
{"text":"It's a 24-hour diner.  Nothing super special, but if you're hungry, you'll get decent food and nice service.  I'll give it four stars because it is quite successful at what it is.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Tasty, filling, inexpensive, family place without all the frills. Went to another nearby breakfast joint that has better reviews but the food here tasted better and was significantly cheaper. Better to give this place a try if you're in the area and looking for breakfast foods."}
{"text":"You will find Country Boys Restaurant at the intersection of Camelback, I-17 and School Cafeteria Food Rd.

They violated my 3B's of diner safety!  The breakfast food was OK, I didn't have a BLT, but my wife's burger was...not OK.  As soon as I saw that bad boy I recognized the perfectly preformed roundness and the unusual texture that says \"cafeteria burger\".

But I waited for her reaction.  I tasted my side of home fries with onions and my single pancake.  The home fries were fine, slightly underdone but fine.  The pancake was also fine.  A tad sproingy but fine.  

\"How's your food?\"

\"The fries are good.\"

\"And the burger?\"

\"It's a little off.  Prefab and the flavor and texture are familiar, but from a long time ago.  I can't place it.\"

\"School cafeteria perhaps?\"

\"That's it.  Exactly.\""}
{"text":"Very impressed by the staff, the food,the quickness in fulfilling the order.  Cudos especially to the cook(s).
Highly recommend to tourists.
May bueno!!!"}
{"text":"Love their cooking. I try to bring my work crew is as much as I can. Eat here a lot alone just doing paperwork. And to get some time. Cant ever go wrong with country boys. Unbeatable prices too"}
{"text":"took my wife there on Saturday morning. it was really good not too pricey and the food was great. the biscuits and gravy was great. homemade is always good."}

{"text":"I Felt like having  decent breakfast, and was out of my \"area\", so Yelped. Reviews on this place were a bit mixed, and I figured I'd give it a try. 
Obviously the  4 star reviewers were NOT \"foodies\"! 
(or maybe lunch is WAY better than breakfast)

I found the service to be fine. Typical cafe waitresses...overworked but friendly enough-and efficient. I left a fat tip. 

The food however was pretty disappointing-for a $11.00 breakfast!
Coffee?  Ugh, Mc Donalds is better...
I ordered 1 biscuit & gravy, scrambled eggs & hash browns. I don't salt my food, but I have never tasted more bland, uninviting food than this. I wanted to add salt just to TASTE something! 
The hash browns were cooked perfectly though...
I think the eggs came from a pour bottle, and I couldn't even eat them. 
Denny's??? WAY Better-and MUCH cheaper!

I would pass on this one, unless you were starving....and flush.
Go on to Denny's, or I -HOP, better food for the same- or less- price."}
{"text":"Great American breakfast joint. We ordered the \"Country Big Breakfast\" special (or something along those lines). It came with 2 bacon, 2 sausage links, ham, 3 eggs, hashbrowns, 2 biscuits and gravy, and 3 large pancakes. This was enough for my boyfriend and I. The hashbrowns were DELICIOUS. I'd go back any day for an all American breakfast. The location was tiny and the service was great. The waitress we had was sweet and attentive. It's an older diner that you can come to any day of the week!"}
{"text":"One of thee Best tasting comfort foods I've had. Fresh tasting and great services! I had the corn beef hash while my boyfriend tried this huge breakfast. It's definitely a lot more bang for your buck! Great prices, great food and can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"A typical diner that serves the expected food at the expected costs. Though not particularly impressive, they are cheerful, friendly, and I never saw the bottom of my coffee cup (constant refills).

This location is near GCU, but also in a very problematic area for the city of Phoenix. The customers include people in all walks of life, stages of grace and disgrace, from the very young to the young at heart. There may be a disturbance if a customer gets rowdy (and someone did get kicked out), but I think you can find that anywhere.

The restaurant was super clean and cozy. It reminded me of many diners back home without the greasy-spoon feel or stickiness. I was greeted by both waitresses at separate intervals upon my arrival. I looked around for a prime spot to grade some papers and people watch. My waitress, Angela brought me coffee and read me the specials and prices. I decided on the Waffle special which included bacon and eggs.

The food. It came out neither too quickly nor did I feel like I was waiting 0 so the timing was perfect. My eggs were neither wet nor greasy unlike some other chain restaurants in the area. They were scrambled and well cooked. My waffle was crispy until it was soggy where the steam was caught between the waffle and plate. This wasn't very good, but cannot be helped. My bacon was perfectly crispy which is how I ordered it and delicious. The food was not served hot, but was a little more than warm. The butter on my waffle was completely melted indicating that it sat awhile. I realized this after seeing other people's waffles in which the butter had not yet melted. The coffee was typical diner coffee, a little weak for my liking but not distasteful and I drank cup after cup.

The waitresses were attentive to all the customers and constantly refilling coffee. I can see why some chain restaurants use half-full carafes! They smiled and greeted the customers. Even when forcing a customer out (I'm not sure what the deal was), they did so pleasantly and authoritatively. They were not rushing anyone out and brought the bill at the appropriate time. 

The cost. It's a fair cost for a diner. Stick with the specials and the 3.99 breakfast special. These are your best bets if you want inexpensive. I don't mind paying a little more for what I really want. Although the surcharge on egg whites was $1.25 which is more than I've encountered anywhere else. That's what I wanted and I was forewarned of this extra cost. When told ahead of time, I accept their policies with a smile. The coffee was $1.99 and I definitely drank my fit. 

I did not come here because it was inexpensive (thought that's definitely nice). I came here because I wanted a cozy diner, prompt service, good food (doesn't have to be great or best-ever every time) that's close and convenient. I got everything I wanted and I was full."}
{"text":"So I rarely give anything below 3 stars... it's my basic I wasn't impressed but not unhappy. That being said I come here once every couple months or so and never really had a problem. This morning I ordered one of my usual meals: The corned beef hash meal with two sides. This is listed in the area that says 'Comes with hashbrowns and your choice of one side. Add a second for $1.49.\" I usually do biscuit and gravy and pancakes. 

The prices here are a little high.... most meals cost $8-$12 and thier portion size has gone down over the last couple years since I started coming. Still good size meal but apart from the $4 special of 2 eggs and either sausage or bacon plus two sides out of a list (extra $1 for pancakes or french toast is listed on THAT menu as well as biscuit and gravy being two items) or the $10 big breakfast which comes with ham, bacon, sausage, 3 eggs, pancakes, hashbrowns, and a biscuit with gravy. (which if I do come back will be the only two things I order) it is not really worth that much. 

The reason that this review is being bumped to two stars is because they are not being true to thier menu. I ordered the item above and I was told it would be an extra dollar because the biscuit AND gravy. Not too happy but said whatever....even though it is listed as one item together in the choice of sides.  -1 star there. Then when my food arrived..... there was no hashbrowns. I asked them and they said that I had substituted them since I got pancakes. I stated that it said in the menu it comes with hashbrowns and one side... they said hashbrowns count as one side. -1 star. I was not very happy with this new reading of the menu.... I mean if you want to change the menu and charge extra then fine... but if you want to change prices then they better reflect in the menu. If I had known that it would turn out to be extra for the gravy and no hashbrowns because I got pancakes I would've just gotten the big breakfast. (The one I got was $9 plus the $1.49 for the second side according to the menu putting it at 50 cents more than the big breakfast but I was willing to pay that to have corned beef hash instead of the other meats) 

At least the food was good and my coffee cup was refilled as it approached being low... total for the meal with a coffee came to $13 even before tip."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time here. The food was medicore and over priced. The service was awful. After getting our drink orders, the waitress didn't bring them for 15 minutes, and then we were ignored the whole time during breakfast. This includes people who were there after us getting their food and drinks first. We were never asked during our breakfast how the food was or asked if we needed refills, while everyone at the tables around us were, I have never experienced such rude service."}
{"text":"Gonna have to give it a two. The service is decent but the food is inconsistent. I've been there three times. First time was good, steak sandwich with fries. 2nd time I had breakfast. Bacon tasted greasy and kind of rancid. Went back a third time, grilled cheese sandwich with fries. Sandwich was okay, fries were cold and greasy. Probably won't try it again."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quality dinner with the right amount of grease and friendly staff to remind me of my favorite greasy spoon back home in Chicago \"Huck Finns\" after browsing through the internet lookin at images of food from various dinners, I picked Country Boys! Great decision! Food was great! Prices were amazing! Service, SUPER FRIENDLY AND HOSPITABLE! Rachel took care of us, she was awesome! Lived in this neighborhood for a little over 2yrs, 1st time walking in this place, and I'm ashamed I didn't know this lil local treasure was here! Try it! And all you GCU kids, this is your delicious hangover cure! Lol"}
{"text":"If you want tasteless, low quality, overpriced food, this is the place for You.  I paid almost $40 for my wife and I. Afterwards, I  felt like I could have had better quality food, at a much better price, in a much better neighborhood, and in a much nicer looking environment.   What a let down.  Even the coffee Sucked!"}
{"text":"Country Boys is nothing spectacular.  They aren't particularly bad either.  My husband and I came here for breakfast one morning after hearing some good things about it.  This is all standard diner-type fair in here.  Pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs... the usual.  I ordered a couple eggs with a side of hash browns and bacon.  It was pretty decent.  The hash browns weren't too crispy and nothing was too greasy, which is good I suppose.  The service could use some help, but it sucks working the morning shift when only a few old people come in and some smelly bums who just finished working the corner on the freeway.  Not a bad place to go for a quick bite to eat for relatively cheap."}
{"text":"They treated us so well we felt like family. Good food and inexpensive. Excellent service and you can't beat the price. Try the Biscuits and gravy are wonderful."}
