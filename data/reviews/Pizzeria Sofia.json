{"text":"Great place for authentic Italian dishes and I should know being from Rome. The pizzas are large and very generous. Couldn't believe I had to take half the pizza to go. The decor is very nice and extremely spacious...rent must be crazy.  One of my favourite touches was that we came in with our sleeping 1yr old and before even asking for the music volume to be lowered, they turned down right away. Would highly recommend this spot to anyone passing by Dix30 or living in the area for that matter. My wife was a big fan as well."}
{"text":"I've been here several times (6 times to be exact). This is my go to place for delicious pizza and entrées.  The terrasse upstairs is charming in the summer. The service was attentive. The Buffalo mozzarella entrée was amazing ! I love all their pizzas  Next visit I will try the pasta dishes. **One warning though,  it's exceptionally noisy during peak hours and I have caught myself yelling to my dinner date because it got so loud."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but we sat and waited for it for an hour and a half. With three kids, any restaurant should know well enough that service can't be this slow. Also, like many establishments in Quebec these days, make sure someone at your table speaks French. If you speak English, the attitude you get is rediculous."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and always enjoyed my meal. The big selection of pizza is good, although I would have to say that it is not hot enough for my liking. The pizzas come out warm on a cold dish which causes it to get cold after about 10 mins. I have already asked them to re-heat my pizza, but turns out it didn't change much. This is the only negative aspect of the restaurant, otherwise, I've always enjoyed myself here."}
{"text":"Fav resto in the Dix30. The manager is very helpful and friendly as is the rest of the staff. Loved the shared antipasti platter and he pizzas were good."}
{"text":"Came here for a few private events at their upstairs area.  The food has been on point every time that I've gone.  They serve mainly Italian food and none of the dishes disappointed.  Special shoutout to the truffle mac n cheese, one of the best mac n cheeses I have ever tasted.  Service here is also awesome and the staff tended to our every need."}
{"text":"I would like to review my last rating of this place and give it a 4 star instead of 3. We went last week and I the pizzas were amazing, the service was great. We were told that the management has changed so a lot of things have changed. All for the best! Good job guys im happy the service and the quality of food is back !"}
{"text":"We keep trying out new places because..well..Montreal is packed with tons of restaurants and it doesn't make sense to keep going to the same old places over and over again. That being said, experiences like the one we had here make me want to keep going to my reliable restaurants in the city because, well...ugh. Yes, UGH.  On a nice afternoon, hubby and I walked into this restaurant to try something new. We settled with the octopus to start, and I had the salmon tartare while he had the grilled chicken. It took about 15-20 min for our starter to come out, and it wasn't really worth the wait. I've had much better octopus elsewhere, but it wasn't terrible so I didn't really mentally dock a star at that point (because that's what I do...mentally rate all places I go to :p). 45 minutes in, and still no main dishes, we were starting to get annoyed. Finally, after asking about the status of our meals, we got both plates (55 minutes into our arrival by this point), and I found myself confused at the sight of my tartare. Never before have I seen a salmon tartare literally swimming in oil. I am in no way exaggerating here but the salmon was coated in an orangey oil and sat on top of a bed of avocado, which was then swimming in a good millimeter or two of the same oil. Although I found it weird, I had high hopes (because really, how can you mess up salmon tartare)? Turns out you can. Never have I had a tartare that tasted like spoonful after spoonful of oil. I even found myself thinking that it was such a shame to mask the flavor of the salmon with this strong tasting oily marinade because really, that's all I could taste. Needless to say, I rated my plate a 0/5 since it tasted like nothing and was really annoyed at the end of my meal that I ate what basically oil with a side of fish and avocado..... Hubby liked his chicken dish but wasn't crazy about it. End this with an $80+ bill, and you can be sure that we will never be back.  Maybe we should've stuck with the pizza (which looked great)...too bad we'll never find out!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! The crust is perfect! The pasta is not bad. The staff is friendly. However, there is no english menu which makes things a bit difficult for us. And also this is the second time I come and ask for the burrata and they tell me they're out. They should add is as a special and take it off the menu. For that reason I would give them a 4. Other than that it's a nice place for a casual lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, service is inconsistent but not horrible. The sangria was yummy and worth the order. The enters like the meatballs or arachini aren't overly impressive and not worth an order. The pizza and salad, however, are yummy. I wouldn't say they are cheap but being one of the few wood ovens on the south shore for pizza, it's worth checking our for an average meal."}
{"text":"Bon, beau et abordable ! Un choix parfait pour manger avant un show ! J'ai mangé les pates aux champignon et c'etait divin ! J'ai bien aimé cette place ! de plus la carte des vins et très compléte ! Il y a beaucoup de vin d'importation privée !   Une belle decouverte dans le quartier dix/30"}
{"text":"One of the better restaurants in Dix30. The decor is nice and the pizza is good. The antipasto platter is excellent."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing !! I went there 3 times in the last few months. The entree of beats and buffalo cheese is sooo good. The ambiance is nice ... Not a quiet place but not overly noisy either. Absolutely nothing bad to say about the plane other than hard to get a table on weekends without a reservation."}
{"text":"Une des meilleurs pizza au four à bois que j'ai mangé au sud de Montréal. J'ai choisi la Végétériana faite de légumes rotis tels que des aubergines, zuchini, tomates et j'en passe. Le tiramisu est très bon. Le choix de thés et tisanes serait à amèliorer. Le décor est très bien et la disposition des tables permet une certaines intimités. Le rapport qualité/prix est fameux. Le service au table est très bien. Le personnel est sympathique et à l'écoute. Ils reçoivent des groupes au 2e étage, ce qui permet aux couples et aux familles d'occuper le 1er étage loin du bruit. Ma cote serait 4.5/5. Je recommande à tous cette fameuse pizzeria."}
{"text":"Came here for my sweet 16, very beautiful place , saturday and sundays are packed, upstairs ideal for birthdays"}
{"text":"Returned again recently. Did not disappoint. This place is incredible. Prices more than average, but worth it. Service is great. Get the Parma pizza."}
{"text":"Les mercredis vins sélectionnés à 50% sont une arnaque. Les vins sectionnés sont épuisés. Le gérant propriétaire s'en est dit désolé et que leur site n'était pas à jour. Deux semaines plus tard, la promo y figurent encore. Le gérant nous a dit de ne pas boire si nous n'étions  pas contentes sur un ton condescendant et pas desolé du tout. La carte des vins n'est pas à jour: on a essayé de nous passer un 2014 pour un 2011 puis un 2014 pour un 2013! La nourriture correcte. Mais aucun respect du client. Soyez vigilants."}
{"text":"The worst service ever experienced on the South shore.  Wine is subpar at New York prices.  Took 45 minutes for shitty apps to be clumsily served.  Calamariplate at $18 was three bites.   The pizzas we ordered (3) two were made by an idiot and served by a moron who obviously doesn't care about this company's menu.   This place is wrong.  Everything about it. Wrong."}
{"text":"If you have some $$$ to splurge , then sure place. Decor is nice, ambiance warm enough. Pros... Decor, ambiance and decent pizza.. Cons... Expensive , not really value for money. I got a gelato to finish the dinner and it was just ice and $8.00 later...you get the drift ... Decent place but overpriced.. No rush to go back and when you lump on taxes and 18% tip, a reasonable dinner for two will set you back $100 + with no wine, beer ... Just the food on two mains, two appetizers and that horrible gelato that isn't gelato"}
{"text":"Excellente pizzeria! À essayer! Belle clientèle jeune! Un vrai restaurant italien! Des pizzas pour tous les goûts!"}
{"text":"Très beau restaurant et une belle ambiance de samedi soir! Le menu est simple, pizza pâtes, ect. Pour ma part, j'aime avec plus de sauce. Une serveuse dépourvu d'émotions et sèche! Manque d'eau, ne rempli pas les verres de vin. Erreur sur facture pour un drink pas au même prix que sur le menu au bar, le gérant qui se prend un peux pour dieu, corrige la situation sans excuse! (exactitude des prix) Je recommande pour un dîner."}
{"text":"First time there. Thought we would pop in for a glass of wine before heading home. Always like sitting at the bar so we did. Nice ambiance and smiling pleasant staff. Bar stools not so much. Mine had a back on it small as it was. My stool wobbled and the small round seat was exactly that - small. Fit for a small tight pointed butt :) definitely not suited for more than one glass of wine. We did however decide to share a pizza. Perhaps the pepperoni I asked for doesn't exist in Quebec because it was substituted with sausage which unfortunately made the pizza greasy. The crust then became somewhat soggy. Flavour was good. Next time if I go back which I may just to see what next time brings I will make sure we don't ask for pepperoni on anything.   I noticed a little patio upstairs from outside the restaurant. Our bartender server whose name we didn't get was nice and attentive. Knew what to say when I suggested the pizza was oily. It's coming from the sausage which it was. In spite of the pizza it is a nice place, nice decor good staff."}
{"text":"Went in. Waitress bitch looked at us gave us a place, went to talk with her friend, played on her phone, we waited 10-15minutes looking at her doing nothing. We were almost the only ones in the restaurant. We left and she looked at us and didn't do or say anything. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I couldn't stop eating, the pizza was so good and very generous in size. The big wood ovens really does a difference. It's seems like a big restaurant but during lunch time it was calm and quiet. I will go back to try all the different sorts of pizza."}
{"text":"Très beau et bon restaurant dans le square dix30 à Brossard! Ils y servent des pizzas cuitent au charbon de bois ainsi que divers plats italiens! Les pizzas sont délicieuses (et géantes) et le plat de pâtes que mon copain avait pris était parfait !! Les prix varient entre 15$ et 40$ , ce n'est pas si pire ! L'ambiance est décontracté et les jours de fin de semaine, c'est plutôt ambiance de bar/lounge ! Un bel endroit à aller si vous avez un spectacle au dix30!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice Italian classic pizza and we decided to try pizzeria Sofia. I want to get something that will remind me of my trip in Italy so i went for the classic Margherita pizza, fresh tomato sauce, fresh di buffalo cheese. It was simple but very good. Tomato sauce was sweet and the crust was well done, crispy and soft in the middle. Very delicious. We also wanted to try a pasta dish so we went for the pardadelle braised lamb, the egg pasta were al dante but the braised lamb was savory and sweet cherry tomatoes were a nice combination! I will take that again. For appetizer, we had the fried calamari with a safran mayo, it was okay nothing to fall down the chair, i personally prefer like thick piece of calamari compared to the tiny rings. The batter was missing some seasoning. Nice service and the place has a nice vibe! Pleasant dinner!"}
{"text":"Mon restaurant préféré du Dix30! Un vrai italien, à m'en rappeler les saveurs du pays.   J'ai mangé quelques fois à cet endroit déjà. Lors de chacune de mes visites, le personnel était genril et attentif. L'ambiance, à la fois romantique et familiale, rend l'endroit parfait pour de multiples occasions.  Même si les prix sont un peu élevés, ils ressemblent fortement aux prix des autres restaurants du Dix30. Et les portions sont bonnes, en plus d'être délicieuses.   Mon seul point négatif est apparu lorsque je me suis assise au bar directement, et que la barmaid était peu au courant de la carte, en plus de nous raconter des détails de sa vie personnelle (très très personnelle). Je ne l'ai pas vu depuis... Donc on leur pardonne. Un must try."}
{"text":"Très déçus de notre expérience de A à Z...  Notre serveuse n'avait pas envie d'être au travail ce soir-là, elle nous a traité avec une froideur glaciale...  La salade d'endives était vraiment moche; des légumes défraîchis, une vinaigrette monotone, aucune saveur ni originalité.  Le tartare de saumon était, lui aussi, vraiment ennuyant. Sans saveur ni présentation.  Nous aurions dû essayer les pizzas maus encore là, je suis septique.  Une salle immense, semblable à une chaîne où la qualité n'est pas une priorité.  Je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and great food for the Dix30. The chef is passionate about the non-pizza items."}
{"text":"Best spot for dinner or lunch at dix30 in my opinion. Great prices and amazing pizza! We had the arancini as an appetizer and it was very yummy! Definitely check it out if your are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This newly opened restaurant is a great place at the Square, Dix30. I went there on lunch time during weekdays. Ambiance is really nice with wooden ceilings, nice architecture, cozy feeling.   I shared bruschetta as an antipasto (appetizer) with a friend.  Among a wide range of cold and hot pizzas, we first ordered Parma pizza, which has tomatoe sauce, prosciutto, aragula and parmesan. Then, we had Capicollo pizza, which has tomatoe sauce, capicollo, green olives and peppers. Pizzas were beautiful, made from fresh ingredients and had thin crust. They were also big enough. I couldn't even finish mine."}
{"text":"Nous étions un groupe donc nous avons dû nous en tenir au menu de groupe. Une facture de 130$ pour deux incluant 2 bières maison, 2 entrées de carpaccio de boeuf, en deuxième service une petite portion de pâtes au tomates et comme plat de résistance une pizza au calabrese (du même genre qu'ils nous servaient au resto de la plage du 3 étoiles d'un récent voyage à Cuba) et un service extrêmement lent.  Comment dire... Pour le même prix j'aurais pu avoir une bonne bouffe dans un bistro français. J'imagine qu'on paie pour le parking \"gratuit\" du dix30, pour le décor plus que réussi de la place et pour le bling bling de ce coin de la rive sud.  Deux étoiles en arrondissant vers le haut. Une première et une dernière fois."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite restaurants on the south shore. The pizzas are delicious and packed with flavour and the seafood linguine is one of the best I've had this side of the Atlantic!   The atmosphere is amazing as well as the decor.  Definitely a great place to go with friends."}
