{"text":"They do some things well and most things great.  I live down the street and enjoy whenever a new place has opened up in the hood and this is no exception.  Service is very pleasant, beers/drinks are plentiful.  Now I've eaten here just once so I don't have the most experience but I enjoyed it and would eat here again.  Review is based on approx 5 visits so far."}
{"text":"I've been in a few times now. I keep wanting to give this place a shot because the food is so good. However, the dining experience has been awkward and frustrating. Each time we go in there were two older gentleman working up front (the owners, I assume) who appear to not know what they're doing and are very neglectful. To add to the negative experience, they blast unsuitable dining room music and have a big screen TV playing children's movies. I don't get.  Maybe get some younger service staff who know what they're doing...  Good food needs to be matched by good service and setting."}
{"text":"Excellent food presented in a great, clean way! Loved the BBQ Pork as a starter with its rich source and the Brisket as a main."}
{"text":"I've only been for brunch but it was amazing. Fantastic, attentive servers and imaginative, well executed dishes."}
{"text":"Not great. It's a standard restaurant with meat and salads and pastas. The have a southern/cajun leaning in their menu descriptions, but there's nothing to indicate they actually can cook southern food. Not going back, but not upset I tried it."}
{"text":"DO NOT BOOK YOUR GROUP GATHERING HERE.   We had a reservation for a staff holiday party that was booked 3 months ago and Junction Local claims that we didn't make a reservation, even though it's clearly documented and confirmed in the email communication. We believe they forgot about us, then took on another much larger booking, and then refused to honour our reservation (despite it having been made earlier) because the larger party would provide them with more income. Either way, it's utterly unacceptable and a terrible way to do business. Definitely have no interest in supporting such a flaky establishment with such little integrity.   THANK YOU FOR RUINING OUR STAFF HOLIDAY PARTY."}
{"text":"Being waiting over 40 min for simple breakfast. Frankly couldn't care how good the eggs are if I have to spend my Sunday waiting for them.  Wouldn't come back or recommend"}
{"text":"Wow. Great southern food.  I came for the meat. The ribs had a nice hint of spice and were fall off the bone succulent. The brisket was equally moist and tender and delicious.  Somewhere in the middle of my meat-fest I fell in love with the veggies. The sweet potato mash, the collard greens, deep fried brussel sprouts and salad were all very tasty. The mac and cheese was tasty and creamy and somehow that extra spiral on the noodle gave it more firmness.  I have desert to go. I am thoroughly stuffed and satisfied.   The service was quick and friendly. The food came out quickly and the atmosphere with the exposed brick is great.  Will definitely come back.   Will definitely have to ask the chef for some tips. I have a big green egg and the brisket and ribs were both better than what I am doing at home."}
{"text":"We just had the worst service I've had in a long time here on a Sunday afternoon.  Food was okay. It took 30 minutes to even recognize we were there and take our order. It took another hour to get our food and this was around 2pm the restaurant was not that busy.  We contemplated leaving but by that time we waited for so long. I would never come back here or recommend anyone to try this restaurant. It was horrible.  The people behind us were waiting for an hour just for their drinks."}
{"text":"I so wanted this place to be my new regular spot as I live in the neighbourhood, but after giving it 3 tries, I'm done. On each occasion I went with different people (the last time with a group of 7) and every single person I've been with has been as disappointed as my husband and me - mostly with the food and on one occasion also with the service. The food (the fish, artichoke pasta, burgers, brussel sprouts) was either bland, crazy salty or slightly burnt.   So incredibly disappointing! Fortunately, we just tried out Leela down the road and have found our amazing new local."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant early last week.   The positives: FANTASTIC FOOD - tried the chicken drumsticks, ribs, and brisket tacos. WOW.  FANTASTIC DRINK- the bartender was cheery and took great interest in what he was serving  There are no real negatives. They're a new restaurant and are still working out their kinks. The staff is a bit disorganized/uninformed but do all seem to be trying their best.  It would be great if they could put a few \"kid friendlier\" things on the menu- not the horrible stuff other restaurants do like a crapburger or noodles with sauce from a jar- kids have taste too but some slightly simpler options.   Happy to see the neighbourhood is taking well to the place!"}
{"text":"Every time I have been here it has been a great experience. I dropped in for brunch one day with my daughter and even though there is no kids menu, I was able to get her eggs and bacon and she was a happy camper. I came again with my sister and friend and when we mis-ordered wine, they were great about taking the bottle back and allowing us to try a couple of others until we found the one we wanted. The food has always been great and the service has been phenomenal. I went back again recently with my husband and daughter for dinner and they are just so nice! We requested if they would put a cartoon on the TV for our daughter and they were accommodating but now that I read that review from the other person, I feel bad! I would suggest anyone who doesn't like what's on the TV, just ask them to change it, they are so nice! The space is great, the wine selection and beer selection is expansive and it's just a wonderful spot."}
{"text":"The mixed reviews are right. Food is good but took WAY too long for breakfast when you're ordering eggs, sausage and home fries. The service was ok, wasn't very welcoming to be honest. Needs improvement."}
{"text":"A bit of a confused menu. Is it a Cajun place. A bbq place.  An Italian Restaurant? The menu had everything from fried chicken to jambalaya linguine, to offerings from the smoker to oysters Rockefeller and onion soup.   Fried chicken was good. The chive biscuit was perfect. So were the baked beans. It had some picked pineapple garnish that made it interesting. But why the fried ramen noodles?  Their offerings from the smoker had seasonal veg and potatoes as sides. Which was odd. They should have offered more bbq inspired sides such as the Mac and cheese. Or baked beans.   Service was great.   I think there are some flashes of brilliance on the menu, they just need to be put together more cohesively.   The ribs were ok. As was the brisket."}
{"text":"Very nice music and ambiance. Service was pleasant. The menu offering was very well put together. The food was beautifully presented and the portions were generous. Most of all the food and drinks were very delicious. Unique and tasty. The owners joined us and were great company."}
{"text":"Ive been here multiple times and it never disappoints.  The reasonably priced dishes (both brunch and dinner) are fantastic and the staff is wonderful.  If you're in the junction, definitely stop by for some quality vegetarian options, A+ barbecue and an extensive craft beer list."}
{"text":"Sat on patio for 25-30 mins, no service despite being shown in by bartender/manager.  Not usually that picky but the place wasn't even busy.  For a place that prides itself on service over the actual dish, I was amazed and left.   Was 30+ degrees and there are many other great options in junction"}
{"text":"18 of us went there for dinner on Saturday and the service was excellent and food outstanding.  Having lived and worked in Houston for many years, this is superb Southern cooking!!"}
{"text":"I've reviewed this restaurant before on Instagram. Been back numerous times even though it's outside my neighbourhood. Service is welcoming. Ambience is relaxing. Food is delish - never disappointing. Can't wait for patio to open. Will be back with or without."}
{"text":"We tried out the brunch menu at the Junction Local at the end of April.  It was very good.  My husband tried the Pork Hash, and loved it.  I had the Meatless Benny.  It was excellent, very generous portions. Very nice presentation in both cases  Service was really good and we were well taken care of by Lisa M and Mladen.  The surroundings are warm and pleasant. We got sunny window seats with a view of Dundas.  We will definitely return. Although, sadly we leaned today they have chosen to give up on serving brunches on Fridays, which means we will not be taking advantage of their nice food."}
{"text":"Best brunch I have had in the village.  It is inspired, inventive and delicious.  I had the pulled pork hash and nearly passed out from deliciousness.  What did they put in there?  I kept chasing the deliciousness to figure it out but in the end I just quieted down and delightfully finished it.  Great service and decor.  Will be back here for dinner!"}
{"text":"We got take out from Junction Local on a saturday night. Would have loved to come in person, but our kid has an early bedtime.   I look forward to trying other things on the menu, but we got the Platter for 4 ($99). Comes with Beef Brisket, Pork Shoulder, Pork Sausage, and Pork Ribs, and 4 Chicken drumsticks, and a choice of  3 sides. It was a really amount of food and a great way to try everything.   Pulled pork was good ad flavourful, the beef brisket was good, but a little dry. Sausage wasn't anything special. I really liked the chicken, juicy and tender, but was a little pink near the bone and I questioned it's doneness. Maybe I didn't have a true experience because I didn't dine at the restaurant, but compared to another bbq/smokehouse in the city (that resides in the back patio outdoors), I wasn't too impressed.   I'll probably come back again, in person this time, only because it's so close."}
{"text":"We've been back a few times and each time our meals have been thoroughly enjoyable.   The food quality is fantastic, very tasty.   Went with a large group and the service was very good.  Everyone in our group raved about the food.  Gino and his team really out did themselves.   They were all very welcoming to my party.   One minor issue, the drink board is on one wall, but every patron would look to the bar and ask about the options - I guess the waitress got frustrated by having to explain the options, she made a few snarky comments.  Maybe she was having a bad night.   Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my friend on a Sunday. The restaurant was busy but it wasn't full. The service here was pretty slow from the moment we arrived up to when we got the bill.   The menu was limited but that's okay because it made deciding what to eat easier. There was a good amount of vegetarian friendly options available too. I ordered the vegetarian Eggs Benedict while my friend ordered pulled pork hash. The food here feels more healthy and green than the greasy brunch restaurants I'm used too which is a nice change.   One thing that's really different and stood out was the eggs benedict used pancakes instead of the traditional English muffin. This gave for a more fluffy texture.   Overall it was a decent experience and I do like that there is a good amount of meatless options available."}
{"text":"This was a disappointing experience for us. Friendly service (a little surprised to hear the wait staff describe something as f-ing but whatever, not a formal place). Cappuccino creamy and frothy. Water refilled. Vegetable frittata was bland with regular toast. No homefries or salad and the eater said they could have made a better frittata at home. Pancakes (Johnny cakes due to southern theme that wasn't particularly apparent at brunch) looked okay. Don't order it for the fruit as there was one blackberry on each of the three pancakes and one anemic strawberry cut into four as the garnish.  Where the kitchen really fell apart was the meatless eggs Benny. It was cold. The eggs were cold, the tomato flavouring underneath was cold, and the mushy English muffin was cold. The boring potatoes that were quartered and baked without enough salt, not fried, were lukewarm. I asked the very friendly waitperson if it could go under the broiler.  They brought a new one. I wish they had just heated up the old one because this was no better. I figured out that the eggs had been cooked but put on cold tomato, possibly warmed wilted spinach, and cold, untoasted English muffin.  I didn't want to complain because clearly the kitchen didn't understand what they were doing so what's the point but the waiter asked so I told, and the owner came over and agreed with my critique. They comped my meal, including my coffee. I appreciated this, and tipped appropriately for the full meal.  So points for attentive service but get your kitchen under control. Maybe sample some of your bland food before you serve it. I wish we had just gone to the Purple Onion.  I don't go out for food that is worse than what I can make at home, and that's a pretty low bar."}
{"text":"The restaurant was half empty, so why the long, long, long wait time for brunch! The table of 6 people beside us said they waited one hour for their food and would never come back, which is the same conclusion we came to, especially when the food finally did come and it was nothing to write home about.  When we complained three times to our server about how long it was taking, she said, you should see how many people we served today, we were soooo busy.  Hello, you are a RESTAURANT!  There are so many options in the area, this is one to cross off your list."}
{"text":"Excellent service! My husband and I came here for brunch. Had the morning mimosa and a beautiful looking Cesar. I ordered the junction sweet tooth waffles & he got the corned beef rost which was really good, a little spicy for me but he LOVED it. I wish I took pics but I was very hungry lol"}
{"text":"Four stars is perhaps more generous than this deserves, yet with a little time and a bit of help from the Yelp-i-verse, it can get there.  I have been inside the restaurant and eaten twice. Once at the bar and once at a table. Here are some takeaways:  1. Like all average restaurants in Toronto the bar space here is used as a dishwashing area and employee cell phone charging/checking area. Interacting with customers at the bar who may come back and spend even more money happens, yet is not a high priority. 2. Service is decent here and could be better. Thus far there is a notably disproportionate amount of attention spent on friends and family of the place who have come by to offer their support to the owner. This is somewhat forgivable. (Early on, however, everyone should have the opportunity to hear firsthand what the place is all about. A little goes a long way.) Service was good at the table and the bar, yet had room for improvement. The tv at the bar does provide for some added entertainment on baseball/hockey nights. 3. The food here is good to very good.  - the chicken plate- huge and quite delicious. It is the best deal here. More northern fried than southern fried. - the biscuits with dill - skip. No southern or creole biscuits would ever use dill. These come off a bit lacklustre. - the half-rack of ribs- very good, not too wet or dry. The sauce adds to the flavour nicely. - fried green tomatoes - delicious. - apple-celery root slaw - skip, unless you just want a pretty bland healthy option to cut a spicy or savoury dish. 4. The beer selection is excellent. 5. Wine? A bit of a random selection. They should focus their offerings. I think they could do Canadian wines exclusively by the glass and maybe do a few others by the bottle. Maybe an outside expert could help them showcase wine in a way that helps sell it. 6. From what small bit I was able to ascertain first hand, Junction Local hopes to evolve into a full-fledged BBQ machine sort of like Barque in Roncy and possibly drift/move away from their other options. They have the smoker and desire to do this. Time will tell.  I plan to return. Hopefully Junction Local will continue to improve. As the Junction heats up, so will the competition."}
{"text":"Service was horrific- totally empty space and server did nothing to sell the menu - couldnt even tell us what the specials were.  She did not spend any time talking about the menu or  how it worked or welcoming us.  then because so empty hovered awkwardly during the meal only asking \"ready to order\".  Ambience fine - but no music no character.   Though some of the food was good (brussel sprouts, duck salad) most was just fine and for sure not worth the price.   there is a reason why indie ale house and playa cabana in the next block over were packed and this place was empty"}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 on April 8, and everyone in our group had a great time. We ordered the brussels sprouts, pimento cheese dip, and haloumi cheese as an app. For our main, we had the mussels and fries + the brisket and fries.  Everything was so delicious.  We even ordered an extra plate of the brussels sprouts - it was that good!    The ambiance was nice and to make it even better, the owner Gino treated us to a bowl of popcorn to end the evening.  I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but I didn't love it.  The owners and server were really friendly and I feel like they have the best intentions.  The décor is beautiful - exposed brick, big chalkboard, etc.  However, I found the menu quite limited and a bit expensive and the food wasn't out of this world.  We also experienced a long wait for our food even though the place pretty quiet.  There's such potential here but they need to unlock it!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The elk burger is one of my favourite burgers in Toronto. I really enjoyed the jambalaya too. Service was warm and friendly. Great inexpensive choices for wine by the glass. Not a lot of people strangely but my guess is that will change."}
{"text":"This place was overall pretty good. We came on a Saturday evening with a large group of about 15.  Good: -Good selection of beers. I enjoyed a very tasty milk stout  -Ambience and decor was very open, fun and warm -Food was tasty. I had the fried chicken which was some of the best I've ever had  -Service was very kind. We were there for a birthday party and our server put extra effort into taking a good photo of all of us and allowed us to bring our own cake and serve it   Not so good:  -Definitely overpriced  -Although service was quite kind, it was very slow and unorganized  -Food menu didn't have a lot of choices   It was a fun evening but I don't think I'd return just because I don't think it's worth the prices."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had about 14 in our party- a few people joined us last minute who were accommodated quickly. The service was EXCELLENT! Kaeley was amazing- very attentive, funny, and professional. Drinks were great. I shared a brisket poutine and carpaccio with the birthday girl and both dishes were delicious (some of the best carpaccio I've had). I will definitely return and try some of their other menu items. Thanks for a great service, Kaeley!"}
{"text":"There are only a few places that I consider my local and ironically this is one of them. It's good to go to and watch the game quietly at the bar with a great selection of taps or select one of there many bourbons! They have a simple yet eclectic menu but they are very accommodating to various diets. My gf is vegan and they have no prob making changes to certain things with a smile. The owner is a sweetheart. SO nice and friendly. Also have some nice big tables for groups. Love it!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been meaning to try it here for sometime and decided too last weekend. There was a line up, but we didn't have to wait long. As we were being sat, my youngest points and yells, \"there's Crystal\". Our favourite waitress from Axis was now here, so we knew we were going to have a great experience. Crystal has always taken care of our family with the best service. She is attentive, willing to go the extra mile and as my wife says is just a great person. We asked where she was serving, she smiled and told us that wherever we sit is where she will serve. We didn't have to read the menu as we told her whatever she decides is what we will have. From food to drinks, Crystal was right on the money. My wild boar meatballs were outstanding and my wife's Brussels sprouts and mac and cheese were just as tasty. The kids gave the ribs and shoe string fries a thumbs up although we agreed we would have enjoyed them better with a different sauce. We were in a bit of a rush since we wanted to catch a show so Crystal had been her fast, efficient self and made sure we were out in 45 minutes. I'm so glad to see she stayed in the Junction (a place with great food I might add) and glad we ventured out."}
{"text":"Four stars for service, but food is more like 3 stars. I'm really rooting for these guys, but food has got to be better than this. Service hits that perfect note and cocktails are deeeelicious. Do yourselves a favour though and stay away from any seafood on the menu - especially the buck a shuck oysters. They were pretty awful. Please take them off your specials, I beg you."}
{"text":"Came here for a late brunch one Sunday morning. We were extremely satisfied. Portions were perfect and food was delicious. The local breakfast with pork hock was stunning, potatoes beautiful seasoned and crunchy. The candied trout salad was a delight to the taste buds.  New brunch spot for us!"}
{"text":"The Junction Local is quickly becoming a favourite of mine in the neighbourhood!  I shared the brussels sprout appetizer ($12), the brisket main ($25) and a side order of frites ($6) with a friend.  We ordered a few bottles of cold white wine (all under $40 per bottle). The brussels sprouts were so very good and the brisket was just massive...probably more meat than any one person should consume alone - glad I was sharing it!  Fries were also tasty and came with a very tiny pot of herbed mayo - definitely could have used more mayo!  We were celebrating a friend's big birthday for dinner and since there was 19 of us in the group, I expected the service to be a shit show but was impressed that it wasn't!  Food came out at a good pace and servers were very good about splitting bills!  I returned on a weekend to check out brunch with the family and ordered the Local breakfast ($14), breakfast poutine ($15) and a kids' sized mac&cheese ($10).  And no brunch is complete without a giant ass Cesar ($12) and a pint of milk stout ($9).  Food took a bit longer to come as it was fairly busy but the manager was kind enough to drop off a few slices of bread for little ones to ward off the hangry.  The local breakfast was decent but the breakfast poutine was the winner - home fries smothered in a brisket gravy with cheese curds.  The mac&cheese was also tasty but had a few spicy pimentos in it that my daughter complained about.  I would just come back to order a few small plates from their dinner menu and have a few drinks.  The beer menu is quite good and features lots of local brews."}
{"text":"Before dropping a friend off at Pearson, we did dinner here. The shrimp, chicken and brisket were excellent and the beer list formidable.  Funny thing: two spicy sauces were provided and while my companion said they were both quite intense, I could taste neither of them!    But I concede, it was likely just me!  Portions were both quite large and we passed on dessert (which may have been a mistake ... maybe next time)!  While the restaurant is itself accessible, washrooms at the bottom of 13-14 steps would be an issue for some.  And that's too bad!  ."}
{"text":"Food was good, but it took 40 minutes to receive our food.  Servers were polite, but couldn't help with expediting the food.  I think the kitchen needs to be more efficient or hire more staff on the line.  Shouldn't take this long when there were only 4 other tables occupied in the restaurant on a Saturday at 12pm."}
{"text":"good find in The Junction. most things on the menu are good for sharing. The JFK (Junction Fried Chicken) was great, came with 4 pieces of chicken. The brisket was well cooked as well. try the Green Fried tomatoes-unique dish and worth a try. I would go back to try their brunch"}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting.. Enjoyable enough but not worth the prices they charge.  Food: average (we tried almost every app and the fried green tomatoes were probably the best  Service: decent service."}
