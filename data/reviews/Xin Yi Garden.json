{"text":"I've been a customer of this restaurant for years. Not the most upscale or high demand restaurant but the employees are very friendly and I've gotten a deal with ALL of my orders. The wait time is minimal and tastes fantastic, I've NEVER had an issue with my food.

I've moved to another neighbourhood and try different chinese cuisines but always find myself returning to Xin Yi Garden. I have yet to find anywhere in any city that I've walked in to or travelled to that compares to their wonton soup!

Four stars because I'm over in Etobicoke now and they're iffy on wether or not it's worth it for them to deliver there. Sometimes it's yes, sometimes it's no... I don't get it but it sucks cause I truly love their food."}
{"text":"The very close proximity of this place made me hope it would be a diamond in the rough. I was disappointed. Ordered sweet and sour shrimp and expecting torpedo or jumbo shrimp like every other Chinese food place,  I instead got 6 mini shrimp that fit into one of the smaller compartments of one of those typical Styrofoam take out containers. At something like $7.50 this is hardly good value. 

Taste itself was not good. Edible but hardly anything I'd imagine anyone returning for. Chicken chow mein had little chicken in it as well. 

I'd give the place one star but the lady who served me was really friendly and so I feel bad. That being said,  I'm surprised they've been open for this long based on the last review."}
{"text":"They left a bunch of flyers in our building so we thought we'd try them last week for delivery.  They were prompt but that is about all I can say good about them.  Hot and sour soup was a weird reddish coloured substance with long oblongs of tofu, lots of sugar, red pepper instead of black, and oddly, shrimp.  Kung pao chicken had few peanuts, too much celery, Western broccoli and lots of gloppy brown sauce with way, way too much sugar.  My partner ordered sweet and sour pork and that was the same colour as the soup and looked yecchy too.

They have Thai food too, and I can't imagine that being much better.

Moondoo is a much better bet for Chinese-Canadian food delivery in the HIgh Park / Junction area.  Skip this one."}
