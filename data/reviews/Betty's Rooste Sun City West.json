{"text":"Been to the 1st Betty's many, many times and have always been more than happy.  Now, I can get all those same great meals, daily specials and homemade desserts in Sun City West.  What a nice place too!  Bigger, clean and bright....what a joy to come into.  Good luck with the new place.  All your hard work, and dedication to pleasing your costumers is obvious from the moment you walk in!  I'll be seeing you and your wonderful staff regularly!"}
{"text":"The food is outrageous, cooked the way you want it by an awesome Chef and the desserts are outrageously Sinfully Homemade Goodness.  Also for all you \"open space\"... Clean is important friends it has that too. More beautiful Sun Flowers will go up on the wall soon.  Come on in to make  Betty's Rooste you favorite Breakfast and Lunch Place."}
{"text":"I had the special which was chicken salad today. It was a huge portion.  The macaroni salad is amazing. We also split a slice of chocolate cake. It was so delicious!!  Both locations have great food."}
{"text":"Had a Drs appointment so had lunch here today. Breakfast was over so had lunch, big mistake , it was bad. The waitress was very nice and there were a lot of empty tables. The food was really bad, once again Yelp friends have disappointed us. I would not say it was inedible but not all that great. Both of us did not finish our food. Maybe the reviews were for breakfast because lunch menu was lacking. I know we will never return! The macaroni salad was really sweet which was odd. Even hubby did not like it. Other choice for sides are cottage cheese (really), coleslaw, or potato chips. Since none are really great, tried the macaroni salad, could not eat it at all. I like to try new places because I'm tired of the same places but yelp keeps leading me down the wrong path."}
{"text":"We decided to try somewhere new and found Betty's Rooste on yelp.  We went for breakfast, it was quick friendly service...not to mention very quiet and peaceful because it wasn't busy yet.  We got a basic breakfast; eggs, homefries, bacon, toast and coffee...still really good and great price that couldn't be beat.  Since it was my mom's bday and she expressed interest in the Key Lime pie but was too full, I returned later that afternoon to purchase a while pie for her bday dinner.  It was the best Key Lime pie EVER!  My only complaint would be that the restaurant is a little difficult to find bc GPS doesn't know how to get you too direct area because it's within medical offices...not to mention the sign isn't very visible until you're nearly passing it."}
{"text":"We found a gem! The food was excellent and the service was the best. It's tucked in right by a hospital and medical buildings. Unfortunately for us, they are not open on the weekends or we'd be there more often.  The breakfast we had was really good.  Biscuits and gravy with potatoes were wonderful."}
{"text":"This is the BESt place to eat for awesome food and pricing. It is always spotless and clean.  I love to stop in here when I am in the area.  Tells all your friends!   I wish there was more of them."}
{"text":",I had eggs bendy great extra sauce  no extra charge. Wife had french toast, best ever.  Try it ."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem nestled in the medical complex on the Banner campus. The food is delicious and the staff is ALWAYS really friendly.  I've brought several co-workers to eat here and have never been disappointed.  This place has become a daily dining experience. A must try when you're in the area. They are open for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Came here after a doctors appt. for breakfast, before my next appt. This is the cutest place, open lay out, very clean. Service was excellent. The breakfast burrito with chorizo was delicious. The homemade salsa was very tasty and fresh. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am so happy to find Betty's Rooste here in our little community . This adorable clean breakfast/lunch restaurant is the perfect place to enjoy a nice leisurely meal with a good friend or even by yourself. How many restaurants can say that?! The decor is charming with a pretty view of a lush green court yard.   The smiling servers keep your coffee cup full and the vibe is peaceful and happy!  Betty's food is exceptional, fresh and prepared with care. The many healthy options are a plus. Oh, and don't forget to order a home baked dessert with a nice hot cup of coffee. I love the bread pudding! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Now Betty's Rooste has a second location.  Come on people you can't go wrong it the best food and HOME MADE DESSERTS you can have. I have not ever had a bad meal here nor in the other. Plenty of room in the all new sun city west for large party's or single.  I love breakfast here. The eggs Benedict awesome pancakes super great with coffee or oj  for lunch home made soups sandwiches burgers and more and don't forget a slice of cake pie cookie or bread pudding. And staff the friendliest around.  Look for my next review and I'll have pics next time ...."}
{"text":"Great location, very economical and world-class cuisine! Brunch is amazing: the fried potatoes, the brioche French toast and the bacon are out if this world! And after you eat you can grab one of Bette's amazing desserts to go, you won't regret it! And if you check in on Yelp you'll get a free drink :-) Run here, don't walk!"}
{"text":"Really nice people but the food is bland. Potatoes need to be cooked longer. Good prices"}
