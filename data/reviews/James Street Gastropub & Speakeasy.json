{"text":"The food and the music here were awesome.  I had the amazing seafood BLT, which included a huge, wonderful piece of salmon, avocado, and bacon.  The music was also wonderful.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"In a word: delicious. My husband and I visited for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We had Jerrod as our server, and he was really personable. We both ordered burgers, which were super good. Onion rings are perfection."}
{"text":"I use to really like this place but the more I go now the worse it gets. Service is horrible, food is nothing great. During the week for lunch when I went a few times there are only a small handful of table but the wait staff take forever to come to the tables, so slow. and they seem annoyed they are there and have to do anything at all. I think I'm finished going there... I tried to many times hoping it would get better and it hasn't. At least the have the music thing going on... :/"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails.  Strong.  Best Sidecar I've had in a long time.  I've been a fan of James Street for awhile.  The menu items were interesting but I definitely enjoyed the drinks and atmosphere more than the food.  I really, really miss the Jambalaya that used to be on the menu.  This visit we had 4 cocktails, the pipe bombs as an appetizer, and entrees of crabcakes and fish/chips.  We left spending about $90 including tip.  I would likely go back for just drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"I love this place through and through. They have great beers, the staff is fabulous, the food is out of this world, and they have live music regularly. Do you know what it feels like to eat a burger in a donut bun with candied bacon while listening to live jazz? Well it's one of my favorite memories I have in Pittsburgh and I can't wait to return over and over again."}
{"text":"A bit of a walk from our hotel across the street from the ballpark but it was seemingly worth it with the food choices available around PNC. Mainly went here for the beer selection - had several different local beers and an Orkney Dark Island Reserve Limited Edition that got more rare as the evening went on (I think by the end they were telling us 100 bottles had been shipped to the US - 50 of which were sent to this bar). Anyway the beer was good. The service was great - although the place was basically dead at 6 on a Friday night which was a little suspect. 
We all had burgers. Mine was supposed to be medium-rare. It was medium-well. No excuse for that. The onion rings that look so good in pictures were disappointing as well. 
All in all had a great experience at this place just was disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh, James street has excellent food, a good beer selection with lots of rotating taps, and the best live jazz scene in western Pennsylvania.  There is a burger with a bun made of donuts on the menu.  Order it, then go home and cross that item off of your bucket list.  The bar features one of the best selections of craft beer bombers in the city, though they can be a tad on the pricey side.  Wednesday nights features a great trivia night, no one can top geeks who drink for quality questions/categories.  Every weekend features live, free jazz in the basement.  It's a place that will even impress your snobby friends from new York city!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today for the first time. No regrets at all. Food and service were fantastic!  I had the BBQ bacon burger and fries and my wife had the Twisted chicken sandwich with potato salad. Yum."}
{"text":"Slightly pricey  yet  reasonable for this type of  establishment.....  The beer selection was large and diverse instantly charming me over there.  I went with GREAT LAKES MONSTER trying to tap into my NE Ohio roots in seemingly enemy territory.    The menu was in the form of an LP  (of which escapes me  but leaning towards Gershwin on the cover ) and offered  standard dining selections  and being that I wasn't all that hungry went with BBQ Chipotle wings which did the job and were properly seasoned and the quality of chicken was slightly above par.  The barmaid (that terms sometimes seems demeaning yet charming at the same time haha) was quite polished and well trained at being personable and at the same time efficient   I believe her name was Emily but I am bad with names.  The patrons were also well behaved, bathed and slightly gregarious but not to the point of trying to sample my wings. :)  Restroom was well maintained and functionable.    Perhaps next time I will dive deeper into the menu and go with an entree but not 100% sure if and when I will be in this neck of the woods in the near future.  Overall a postiive experience and i didn't feel like I needed an aspirin or  to take a shower after I departed."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch and dinner. Terrific staff, good cocktails and fun menu - beyond the fab music at night."}
{"text":"A gem of the Northside!
Great brews.
Great food.
Great atmosphere.
Great staff.

Love it!"}
{"text":"James Street has quickly become my favorite jazz club in Pittsburgh. The musicians that play there are some of the best in the city, and I like how there are two sections, so you know that the people who choose to sit in the speakeasy are going to actually appreciate/listen to the music. The menu has a great selection of drinks and food. I have yet to order something I didn't like. I also think it's nice how there is a different cover for sitting at a table vs. sitting at the bar. As a music student who is still in college, it is not always easy for me to put down $15 just to be able to sit in during a jam session. At Little E's, I was constantly pestered for money (even for a glass of water with my meal). James Street has a really laid back atmosphere, and I will definitely be visiting as frequently as I can."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, the service was good but could have been a little faster.  The food was hit-or-miss.  There were five of us.  The macaroni and cheese with bacon was very good, the Bada-Bing sandwich was very good, but the shrimp with grits was not good at all - the shrimp were cold and the grits seemed like they were made from instant.  The burger was also very good, and the salad was ok."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, as the decor/bones are great and food is a bit more interesting than other North Side spots. Good beer selection too (tho that's common in neighborhood). The problem is the service. 
Whether it's a crowded night with bands playing or a quiet one as it was tonight (2 tables in dining room, 6 at the bar, 3 small booths occupied) the service is lousy. And it comes from the top. On one of the three times I was trying to waive down help (once to get a beer that I ordered three times, twice again to get check) I was waiving at owner and lead bartender to no effect. 
I live on the North Side and I and my neighbors -- who have had the same kinds of experiences -- want tis place to succeed and be better."}
{"text":"We will not be back. Sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon to kill some time before a wedding nearby. Service was terrible. When we finally got our check for two draft beers it was $20!! We double checked to make sure it was correct and it was. I've never spent that much on two beers before and can't understand why they charged so much. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Nice place in the neighborhood to grab a drink and pretty good food. I really enjoy their turkey burger, and they make a pretty decent margarita. Sometimes the jazz in the basement is a little too loud, but the music upstairs is really nice."}
{"text":"Best Buffalo Chicken Sandwich in Pittsburgh!!!!  Very cool layout.  Great staff.  Unique beer selection."}
{"text":"A speakeasy in Pittsburgh!  It's great that the 'burgh has a place like this.  

I've only been there once (so far), but the food was decent, the jazz space was intimate, and the music was very good.  Easy street parking, too.  The night we were there, they were having a jam session, so the house band started off the set, and then they opened it up to invited musicians.

My only complaint is that the waitstaff seemed too busy to speak to us or seat us when we first arrived.  We stood around for what seemed like a long time, waiting for someone to say something, which they never did.  We eventually intercepted someone who looked like they worked there and asked if we could just seat ourselves.  After that service -- while a little on the slow side -- was fine.

It IS a jazz speakeasy after all.

I definitely plan to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times under various ownerships over the course of maybe 10 or so years, and I'm refraining from reviewing the ambiance (because that really doesn't change) or the music because I'm not too hip to the jazz scene (although they seem to have a limited number of bands here).

My first impression walking in today was disappointment for the fact that they removed their bottled beer selection that I thought was pretty solid.  My second impression was, where the shit are the pipe bombs and the other interesting menu items.  And lastly, why did they bump up the price by 1/3 when they dumbed down both the menu and the beer selection.

Maybe they're making a push to appeal to more Pirate fan walk-ins, but I think this change impacts whatever made this place unique.  I asked the waitress, \"when did this place change?\"  She said, \"a lot of people ask that.\" She went on to say probably when they hired a new chef.  

Well, chef, what the hell?  And , why was all my food oversalted?  Why take all steak items off the menu?  Why charge $15 for a dry burger when I can do better right down the street... or whatever place you're trying to emmulate?  

Also, why not have a little AC on when it's a 90 degree day?  Have you scared that many customers away that you can't pay the bills?  

On a positive note, the waitress I had was way more attentive than what I experienced in the past, so that's good.  

So, yeah - just turn this place into a sports bar or whatever.  Maybe if you sell enough i.c. light you can turn the AC back on.  

Ps.  Those jazz album menus were also great, before you scrapped those too."}
{"text":"The James Street Gastropub & Speakeasy was the choice of a member of our monthly dinner club.  No one in our party had ever been there and none of us are likely to ever return.  It takes a LOT for me to have a negative opinion of service, but this was easily the worst service I have ever had.

One of the main reasons this place was chosen was for the happy hour.  The website advertised \"Big Bottles, Small Plates\" for Tuesdays - buy a large craft beer (22+ oz) and enjoy a free appetizer (up to $9).  When we first arrived there were only 2 parties in the dining room, yet it took almost 10 minutes for us to be seated.  We asked the server if the happy hour special was exclusive to the bar or it was applicable to the dining room and she told us that she would have to check.  We waited, and waited...and waited.  After over 10 minutes she came back and said  that they were changing things and what was advertised on the website was not the special.  We asked her what the happy hour special(s) were and she wasn't sure - maybe $1 off beer and something with wine and appetizers.  We asked for a beer list and were given a handwritten list.

After being seated for 15 minutes, our server brought 3 waters for 4 of us and turned and left without taking drink or appetizer orders.  I would understand being busy, however there were only 2 other tables in the entire dining room.  The server returned and each of us ordered a drink.  A few minutes later she returned with 2 drinks.  We asked again about the happy hour special and she left to ask her manager.  She returned a few minutes later and said that if we purchased a bomber bottle we would get $7 off of an appetizer.  We asked for the bottled beer list, and we were referred to the back of the menu.  We checked our menus and found no beer lists.  She said she would get us a beer list and away she went. 

The rest of our party (4 more people) arrive - a different server arrives to take their drink order.  She apologized for the first server - indicating that she was the only server on the floor tonight (keep in mind we are 1 of only 3 tables).  She takes drink orders and returns with their drinks. However,  2 of our 4 original party members have still not received their drink orders from 20 minutes ago, nor have we received the bottled beer list we asked for 20 minutes ago.  At this point we have been there over an hour and are starving, while watching 3 staff roll silverware 10 feet from us, including our server, yet no one comes over to take our order.  The server then brings drinks for the 4 new members of our party, while 2 of our original group have yet to get their drinks.  1 person cancelled their beer order (after 20 minutes) and changed it to a bottle.  We also had to remind the server about the wine that one of our party members ordered 20 minutes ago.

After 1 hour and 15 minutes from the time we arrived, a server returned to take our appetizer order, we included our dinner orders because of how slow service had been.  We asked if we could have multiple checks because we were there as couples - we were told that the checks would be separated no problem.  Our appetizers arrived 30 minutes later and conversation at our table stopped as we all ravenously ate.  I'm very easy to please with food, but the chips tasted like vegetable oil.  

2 hours and 15 minutes after we first arrived, our entrees arrived.  The food was 'ok' at best - not 1 member of our party talked about the food being good, as our disappointment continued.

Our waters were never refilled the entire time we were there (which ended up being 3 hours.)  Inexcusable.

At this point, we were taking bets about how many of our 4 checks would be incorrect.  The check finally arrived, and we were all on 1 check, despite requesting and being told they would be broken up by couple.  Moreover, the server admitted that she did not know who ordered what and asked us to mark on the check who ordered what so she could split the check appropriately.

We look at the check and the first line item was the beer that one of our party members ordered but never received.  We then find 2 drinks that rang up at $5 higher than the menu price (a $15 bottle rung up at $20 each).  We  made 3 qualifying purchases to receive $7 off of appetizers ($21 off total) and none of these were reflected either.  Each couple then had to individually write our orders down on a slip of paper and turn in to our server so they could be corrected.

Finally, after over 3 hours, we paid our checks and left.  At it's peak, there were 4 tables in the dining room.  The consensus was that this was easily the worst service that any of us had ever received.  I will never return to this place.  I strongly recommend you avoid the James Street Gastropub and Speakeasy - unless you want to experience extremely slow, completely awful service while you wait hours for less than mediocre food."}
{"text":"i really like this place - vibe was good, service was very good, music was entertaining and the space is nice.  the cocktails were ok, but they ran out of some of the beers i wanted to try.  the rating is for the totally disappointing food.

unfortunately, my experience was that the food sounded better than it actually was.  on the whole, the food lacked SEASONING, as in there was NO seasoning at all, not an iota, not a speck - just bland bland food.  i had the pipe bombs (wonton wrapped steak, peppers, cheese), buttermilk chicken with white cheddar grits and collard greens, wings, and something else that was forgettable.  the steak in the pipe bombs needed to be seasoned before cooking, neither the chicken itself nor the breading had any seasoning whatsoever, the grits were totally tasteless and you couldn't taste the white cheddar, the greens had no flavor, and the hot wings had no heat at all.  even a small amount of salt would've made a world of difference but there was nothing.  further, even if the chicken entree had flavor, it's way overpriced ($17) for the super cheap ingredients and cooking techniques involved.

when the server asked how the food was, i was honest but nice (i mean, how else will they know?).  he seemed receptive to my comments, but also said they leave the seasoning up to the customer.  uh, i can see leaving adjustment of the salt level up to the customer, but there has to be some flavor to begin with.  people don't go out to eat for bland food, only to have to make it taste like something because the cook is lazy.  i certainly would not pay $17 an entree for that experience.  also, i ordered the wings hot - that means they're supposed to be cooked and come out spicy.  i don't mean they were slightly spicy and that was their version of hot, i mean there was no spice at all.

in sum, good place to drink but not eat.  if they could get it together in the kitchen, it would be a really nice place."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. The appetizers came out frozen in the middle, lukewarm on the outside. Food was nothing more than generic bar food. The staff took our food to package it up and began throwing used napkins and random table garbage on top. Overall nothing special."}
{"text":"Was invited to lunch and, honestly, I was a bit intimidated.  I have been to a few \"gastropubs\" and I just cannot get the image of a bloated belly out of my head anytime I hear/see that name.

I am happy to report that, once again, my mental image be darned, the food was fantastic.  These gastopubs know what they are doing.  

I did go easy with a Chicken Cobb salad - but it was fantastic.  Great mix of crispy bacon, avocado, and a hefty chicken breast left me one happy customer.

Looking forward to a great new lunch spot, with parking, on the North Side!

Oh, and while I did not partake, the beer selection was very extensive & impressive."}
{"text":"(2 1/2 stars rounded up to 3)

I've found myself mostly stuck in restaurant mediocrity lately, but that has more to do with the types of restaurants I've been choosing (not me, but the people I've been with) than any particular fault of the establishments themselves.  We just all have different preferences and ideas of what we think is good, but enough with stating the obvious.

Once again, I find myself saying this just really isn't my kind of place, but I could see it appealing to some, particularly if you're looking to go to a place that features live jazz and serves good ol' southern style belly busting meals.  I happened to be there at a time when live music wasn't playing, but I've heard good things about the Jazz scene here and the place has the right ambience for it.

I had the Steeltown Sirloin sandwich and it came with a nice side of homemade style potato chips that ensure you get enough carbs with the meal - even if you're eating for 2 - but better to have too much than not enough, right?  The sandwich was ok, nothing all that special, and the bun was good (thinking Breadworks?) other than being soggy on the bottom, which didn't bother me all that much but seems worth noting.

This place certainly isn't outrageously expensive, but it's not cheap either. For the money you're likely to spend here, there are a myriad of other places you could go in the city, so unless you're bent on dining to live jazz (be sure to check ahead on times this is featured) or you want to stay very proximal to AGH for some reason, keep that in mind.

P.S. They do have a decent drink list if you're not dining with a group of puritanical teetotalers.  After all, it is a pub."}
{"text":"So my wife and I have been going to the James Street for many years and have always loved everything about the place.  The food, the atmosphere, the music, etc...

We took some friends there last night that had never been there.  I had, as I always do, hyped the place up because of our consistently great experiences.  The menu's, for years, have been placed in an old album jacket of some great jazz or blues artist.  Classy touch.  The menu had some really unique items that I had not seen elswhere.

To make a long story short - they have changed the menu - not just a little bit but drastically!  A simple two sided piece of paper with a vastly different menu and no beer menu was placed in front of us.  They removed the Pipe Bomb appetizer which was amazing - we ended up ordering the spinach dip appetizer and it was a small ramekin of what appeared to be frozen chopped spinach with not much added to it.  wasn't creamy or cheesy, just looked like plain spinach.  It was served with 4 small pieces of pita. 3 cucumber slices, 4 pieces of red pepper and I think a few slices of carrot.  All for a whopping $11.00.

Also removed from the menu the Sweet Meat burger - I ended up ordering a bacon blue cheese burger that was overcooked, dry, lifeless with fairly decent potato salad on the side.

The service, which is usually fantastic left me wondering what was happening.  our party of 4 sat for 20+ minutes before we were even approached for drinks - and probably a half hour before we ordered food.  Three other tables seated after us were eating appetizers before we had even ordered ours.

I will continue to go for the great music and atmosphere but might consider having dinner somewhere else before the show.  Hopefully this is not a permanent change...."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. We waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for an appetizer and a burger, and there were only 2 other tables with people at them when we went. Then they got our whole entire check wrong, and asked us to write down what we had. Our drinks were never refilled. Keep in mind we were there at peak dinner time. Do yourself a favor and eat dinner some where else. The food wasn't even good."}
{"text":"When you wind up being inadvertently diverted to the North Shore due to ridiculous weekend construction, what do you do? Lose $500 at the casino! And after that? Go to James Street! James Street is gonna make everything alright again.

After my bf reached his daily max on ATM withdrawals, we took it as a sign that we should probs leave the roulette table behind, and venture out to get something in return for our cash money. I'd had James Street bookmarked for a while, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to finally knock it off my to-do list. 

The place itself wasn't hard to find, but it wasn't easy either -- as in, it's not really on a main street where you'd just happen to drive past and say \"Hey! There's Janes Street Gastropub!\" 

Regardless, we got there, parked on the street nearby, and entered at about 5pm on a Saturday. The place was pretty dead -- maybe 6-8 people at the bar, nobody seated in the dining area. We chose a booth right near the bar, and our waiter promptly came over to give us menus and take our drink orders.

The menu had lots of options that looked good, and I think I'd describe the selections as mostly comfort food kinda stuff, but with a kick. 

We started with the oft-touted \"pipe bombs\". Mmm... They didn't disappoint! Thinly sliced flank steak was nestled in between pepper jack cheese, red and green pepper, and jalapeños. Better yet, it's all rolled up and deep-fried like a spicy, Spanish eggroll! Oh, and it gets better -- the dipping sauce they serve it with is SO good. It's got all the tang of A-1 (I don't care if mentioning A-1 makes you think less of me -- I'd drink that sh*t for breakfast), but its consistency is that of an au jus. It really added to and complemented the \"pipe bombs\"!

Now, on to The Main Dish: Chicken Fried Steak! Oooh, boy. It. Was. AWESOME. Perfectly seasoned crispy breading. Tender steak. Delish gravy with a peppery kick. The smashed potatoes were a perfect accompaniment. Oh man, just recounting this is making me salivate. I will definitely be going back to James Street soon!"}
{"text":"This is my second review of my dining experiences at James Street and it is definitely an improvement from the first. At first they weren't sure if we could get a table but then thanks to a no-show we were able to get in. Despite being as busy as they were, the kitchen was pumping out food at an amazing rate.  I ordered the veggie stuffed green peppers and it was pretty good. The server we had was good and attentive, but she could definitely been more friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner, drinks, and the Jazz show in the basement.  Overall, we were very happy with the food, service, and show.  The band playing that night was energetic and very talented, with excellent jazz solos.  Our server was excellent.

We started with their appetizer special, \"Devil's on Horseback\", which was a fried oyster with a bacon jam served on a small toasted piece of bread.  There were three of these on the plate and they made for a great appetizer.  For dinner we split a bbq crunch burger with pulled pork on top and their gumbo.  Both were very good.  The gumbo had a hint of spice but was by no means overpowering.  I really appreciated that the pulled pork on the burger was large smoky chunks.  

They have a nice selection of craft beer and the cocktail I ordered was well made.  Most of the tables, it seemed, were filled with couples on dates as this makes an excellent date spot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had not been here in a while and part of that was because our previous visits were mixed. So we decided to go back for a change of scenery since we typically go to the same 3-4 places. Well I can say that we will not be returning. We ordered the wings super extra crispy which did not come that way nor where they tossed evenly in the sauce. Some had gobs of sauce while others were practically plain. The sauce itself had too much tomato taste. Maybe some people like it but we did not. My wife's Caesar salad was huge which is not bad in of itself except with full leaves piled on top of each other it was unwieldy. 

I had a burger medium well with cheese lettuce onion and an over easy egg with no bun. The lettuce was placed on the bottom so it became wilted and warm very quickly. There was no onion and the egg was sunny side up but just overly cooked on the bottom that it was partly black. The burger itself was dry and had very little taste. To top it all off my wife's gumbo was so bad she sent it back. She didn't know what the taste was but is was more like mush than gumbo. 

It is a shame because the north shore needs locally owned places with character and this place could be great but with average service and sub par food you are better off at Monterey Pub or Max's if in the area."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for our party of 10 for a Friday night, which is a necessity. The service was prompt and friendly, the food was delicious, and the jazz band was awesome. Loved the fried oysters and bean salad. I look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"I truly believe that Pittsburgh has the worst dining options that I' be ever experienced in a decent sized city.  Without getting too detailed, suffice to say that this \"Gastropub\" did not at all exceed my low
 expectations."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short: If you're looking for a place to eat lunch on the North Shore, don't go here if you have any place to be within the next few hours. I arrived at 12:05, didn't receive my food until 12:42, and didn't get to pay my check until 1:20. My drink was refilled twice in that time frame. So, plan to be there a while if you go, and be prepared to advocate for service. This has happened both times I've gone for lunch and ordered something other than a bowl of chili.

The food I had was okay."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Sunday Drag Queen Brunch. They never mentioned there was a $10 cash cover charge. The mimosas were pre made and disgusting. The brunch food was just average (if that) The roasted Brussel sprouts weren't cooked completely and the ends were left on. Service was slow and then they added an 18% gratuity on the bill for a party of 2 prior to taxes. I guess that's why they add the gratuity. Because they may not get a sufficient one otherwise. Then in addition to that they added a service fee. Not sure for what?  Left a message to question and never received a call back. Will dispute with the credit card company. The only thing good was the show!!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighborhood.  Wonderful homemade offerings like a juicy and crispy fried chicken breast or their hearty meatloaf.  A+ service.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"First obvious observation: It is not on nearby James Street...lol.  It was recommended.  Not sure why.  It was ok for a limited menu joint.  Mostly burgers that come with greasy homemade chips or of course fries.  Sorry, but had enough fries this short vaca to last 6 months.  Lots of beers of course.  A quaint place. I got the $7.00 pierogee appetizer.  Only 3.  Really?  These are a cheap item.  Might be a  $5 item. Had more of them in Philly for less $."}
{"text":"2-3 people on waitstaff (ours was brand new to waitressing, apparently) 1-2 bartenders on a Sunday afternoon with maybe 3-4 other tables full in the place, we should be well taken care of, right? Took forever for someone to take our order, we ordered beer off the menu and 10 minutes later the waitress informed us the beer wasn't available. Ordered different beers, 10 minutes later the waitress came back with the wrong beer. Meanwhile the beer cooler and taps were about 8 feet away from our table, I could have walked up, grabbed a beer and sat back down about 400 times by the time our waitress came back with one beer. Food took fairly long to arrive. Pierogies were pretty good. I ordered a cobb salad that was passable. My husband ordered a burger that came out looking like a charred beer coaster on a hamburger bun. The waitress and manager were very apologetic and they did take the burger off our bill, which was nice. All in all, completely underwhelming food, meh beer selection and bafflingly slow/incompentent wait staff...don't bother."}
{"text":"Maybe I am spoiled or just am to old school for Jazz Clubs here in Pittsburgh.  But I remember when the performer was on stage that YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND LISTENED TO THE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!  I know why BOB and Susan are getting divorced, I know Helen has bunions and the Doctor she goes too is a crook.,  but didnt get a chance to hear some great music.  

Its not the same when Mr. Poole owned it.  The food is subpar, and not even presented well.  Im just saying, when Mr Poole owned the Place, you knew what to expect Great Music, Great Drinks, Great Food, and GREEAAAATTTTT Service."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot on the northside in Deuschetown. In the space formerly known as Serendipity a block off east ohio street.

The Pierogies were amazing. Definately will be going back."}
{"text":"Food was barely ok, beer selection is great, but service is lacking and the \"management\" was superficial at best.   Parking is a mess and if there is an issue in the restaurant parking lot forget trying to get any help.  If you go, walk!  Not a good place for folks from the \"burbs\"."}
{"text":"Interesting beer selection and great appetizers/bar food. Was good for dinner too but mostly seems like a great hangout especially on nights with live music. Set ip across different rooms which really helps enable multiple experiences in the visit. Nothing else going in the neighborhood though!"}
{"text":"Nestled in a beautiful corner lot building on the North Side, my wife and I have been coming here for years. Great beer selection, beautiful interior, and a wide array of programming that sets them apart. Love music, video game tournaments, fundraiser, you name it.

The food is typically spot on. I've had some nights with less than ideal meals (mushy wings on two occasions), but I almost always love their sandwich and entree options. Hey definitely seem to excel on the \"Cajun\" style aspects of their menu."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot on so many occasions. Food is fantastic, drinks are strong, drink selection is huge, bartenders are nice, knowledgeable and downright awesome! I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich on the pretzel bun with the onions rings. The onion rings are thr best onion rings ive ever had! There is something special about these puppies! There is so many things i want to try on the menu but I cant seem to stray from the delicuous chicken sandwich. My girlfriend got the chicken dinner one night and from what I tasted it was delicious. The grits were out of this world good!!! I also saw someone get the fish sandwich or fish finner and it was HUGE! This place kicks butt on so many levels, there isn't anything I can think of that's bad about it. Def worth checking out! Pretty sure they close at 1 on weekends so be sure to have a last call bar lined up if you plan on drinking til 2am!"}
{"text":"riding our bikes around PGH (tourist) and we were looking for a place to eat that wasn't hyped or a chain. glad we stopped in. everyone is friendly and warm, and service was prompt. 

two big tv's in the bar area - we sat in booths just off of the bar that are up a few steps - good view of the whole place if you want to people watch. 

I had a burger with pierogies on top - that's crazy. but the meat is local and the burger was tasty. cole slaw is average. Mac and cheese is super cheesy. my husband had wings - good - and the blues burger. he gives the burger 3 stars....would have given it 4 stars if they hadn't over cooked it (he asked for medium).

recommend this place, but it was a bit more pricey than we thought ($47 for 2 people, no alcohol ordered)."}
{"text":"We came here during Craft Beer Week since there was a Brooklyn brewery beer tasting + Sinful Sweets pairing. We went to Penn Brewery first and had a very poor experience just trying to get seated (waited forever just to be acknowledged, were finally seated with menus, and were then rudely told by another employee that we had to move because there was a wait). So we opted to leave. No sense in giving money to a place that doesn't quite value our experience or know what the shiz is going on, y'know?

We took the short drive to James Street Gastropub and Speakeasy and it was immediately better. We got a spot in their parking lot which was great; it gets so old paying for street parking everywhere (I'm looking at you Southside!). We quickly got the attention of an employee and got a table for dinner. Our waiter, Zach, was great and very attentive. They had run out of promo glasses (you got one if you ordered a Brooklyn beer) but he snagged one someone had left. It was a nice gesture, you know? :) We ordered the oysters which were very delicious (they're out of the shell and fried with a cajun breading with a horseradish sauce on the side) and we had the three times fried fries, although they didn't seem like they had been thrice fried, they were still tasty. Their beer, wine, and cocktail list is extensive and there is most definitely something tasty for people of all preferences. I was the DD tonight, but they had cider which I appreciated as a pretty big cider advocate. The vibe here is wonderful, intimate yet casual, and the music they play is awesome. You won't hear any pop-y trash in this place, which is a nice change of pace. The bartender was also friendly, and the manager checked on us after making a beer suggestion to go with the oysters. It felt a bit like we belonged here, which was great. I'm definitely keeping this on my list of places to re-visit!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for James Street, but I can only say that it was okay.  

The cocktail I ordered, a cucumber gin fizz was delicious and the food I had, the chicken sandwich  on a pretzel bun was good, but not anything special.  The fried vegetable appetizer was pretty good--especially with the sauces they served with it, but the beer chips were underwhelming.  To bill a restaurant as a gastropub, I was hoping for a little more creative flair to the food.

The service was friendly, but sometimes painfully slow.  We were there for a little more than 2 hours for a single round of drinks, appetizers, and dinner (one member of  our party ordered a second cocktail, but it was never delivered).    While I understand the limitations of a small kitchen, I feel like they could have better prepared since we had made a reservation a week ahead of time."}
{"text":"I was with a group ~25 people.  We had a private room in the basement.

The old wood floors, tables, and walls were beautifully maintained.  The bathrooms left a lot to be desired ... clean but ...

We had spring green salads ... good.  For dinner we had choice of steak, chicken, or fish.  Everyone who ordered steak were asked how they would like it cooked.  My sole was covered in bread crumbs .. with bones.  Each meal came with diced potatoes and cauliflower with a cheese sauce.  I could've eaten a plate of just the cauliflower mixture.

For dessert we had a slice of cheesecake with a berry sauce.  It was a nice finish to the meal.

The waitresses were attentive."}
{"text":"Long story short: DONT DO IT!

Read below for elaboration.

As I write this review I am sitting waiting for service. I decided to choose this restaurant based on the gastropub theme which usually means a focus on good flavors and new ideas from what I've seen. The food was bland. The hummus was flavorless, the Mac and cheese was flavorless, the fish sandwiches taste fishy (which means old fish is used), the shrimp aren't deveined, the burgers were dry, the homemade chips tasted like old grease, the chicken sandwich didn't have good flavor, and one of the drinks came out with food particles floating in it. 

I don't use yelp to complain; I'm not that kind of guy., but I had to apologize for picking this place over a reputable chain. I would strongly urge anybody to choose another place. This is the worst experience I've had dining in years. I left tons of food on the table, the food I ate made me feel sick, and wasted almost $100."}
{"text":"Three of these stars exist because there is a great selection of beer on tap, and I can walk to it from the hospital.  Didn't try the food, but the menu looked fairly average.  Didn't listen to any jazz.  Just went to get my drink on, and a good time was had."}
{"text":"Well, this is an interesting one. Was in Pittsburgh for the weekend, checking out fun places, so I called to make a reservation. I made a reservation for Sunday night for 2.

So I pull up Sunday night and the place is desolate. There's no one around. The entire neighborhood seems abandoned. I look to my girlfriend and say \"It's like the place is closed\". So as we walk up, the door is locked, there's a sign on the door that says closed until Tuesday. 

If you knew you were going to be closed, perhaps calling us to cancel the reservation so we could make alternative plans would have been nice or just not making the reservation at all. It does seem there's been some recent problems (liquor license in jeopardy according to the Tribune-Review), but the lack of reaching out concerns me about the overall state of the restaurant, and makes me think that we dodged a bullet from a potentially uninspiring night."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if the food wasn't so good. 

Went early on a Saturday evening and it was pretty busy.  However, not even close to busy enough to justify our service.  After sitting there for an hour after ordering to only have the waitress stop  by maybe four times each time because we had to call her over, and each time it seemed to be a hassle for her because she was so busy.  Which was funny because   the waitresses were all running around like crazy.  However, they never seemed to be carrying anything and they were definitely not carrying our drinks.  It was almost like Yuengling meant \"thank you but we're fine, don't come back for a half hour\" in a foreign language.

We were finally fed up so I asked for our check, we were going to be leaving, which I have never done before, when our waitress said she'd check on it.  She served it cold, and forgot one person's meal and was willing to do nothing about it when we complained.

For cold chicken wings, and a cold burger it was pretty taste.

Never saw a manager, and clearly the front house staff had no clue.   

The bartender walked out from behind the bar at one point and started grinding up behind one of the waitresses.

There was plenty of staff in the kitchen.  However, one gentleman working in the kitchen went to the bathroom about every ten minutes.  I choose to think to take a bump because the alternative thought is not too appealing while your eating....or dreaming about food while we waited."}
{"text":"I discovered this place while visiting recently, and it has quickly become one of my favorites! (too bad I had to return to Florida) TOO MUCH GOOD STUFF TO CHOOSE FROM! Seriously, the menu is great. It's all your staple food but with a twist, and then some. The Crab Cake Sandwich was top notch, no imitation. Pipe bombs were also especially delicious. They also have a section on their menu called \"Chefs gone crazy\" that changes every so often. It's pretty much chefs taking a creative license in ways you didn't know could be so tasty.

The ambiance is awesome too. You walk in and it's like you've been transported to a different era. Very classy, jazzy, 1920s feel to it. Speakeasy, duh. It's just a really unique place that is hard to come by these days among all the mass chain restaurants. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's so refreshing to go to a place off the beaten track with its own unique voice and style. I'll admit that I am by no means a jazz connoisseur, but I do enjoy some good jazz with a nice stiff drink once in a while. The place is cool and hip yet brings an older crowd from the neighborhood. The happy hour here is good- the last time I went I had a Vesper martini (I love Casino Royale, don't judge me!). The wait staff is actually really nice- I originally asked if the Vesper was on the happy hour special and he originally said no- but came back later with the drink and apologized for making a mistake. While the upstairs is more open with TV's and has more of a sports bar feel, downstairs is where the action happens, with a stage for live music and a dance floor. I've never had food here, but I've read pretty good reviews about it. The live music is the obvious highlight here, and I'm actually going there for some music and swing dancing tonight!"}
{"text":"My shrimp and grits was good. However my fiancée chicken sandwich wasn't the best at all. Online the chicken sandwich say $10 but on the menu $14. Oh well. Maybe better luck next time."}
{"text":"The food was alway average at best but the entertainment was fantastic. They were never bashful with the drinks either. Sorry to see it go. It was great for the neighborhood and great for the Pittsburgh music seen."}
{"text":"I was super pumped to finally try this place. A friend of mine (Chelsey Nicole, sometimes with the Northside Vamps, check 'em out, y'all) plays here often, so obviously I know they have some good musical tastes. I'm not sure who the group was that was playing while we were there, but they were awesome. Unfortunately, though, it was so loud that after a while our group moved back upstairs so that we could actually talk to each other, like people tend to do when they wanna hang out.

Good beer selection. I got the Anderson Valley blood orange gose, which was great and very well priced. We ate before we got there, but I ordered a salad when I realized I had eaten 0 veggies that day. My caesar salad, which was two huge hunks of romaine with no form of meat, was $10. I spent the first 18 years of my life in Pittsburgh, and it is true that the Northside is way, waaaaay trendier than it was $10 years ago, but is it $10 caesar salad trendy? Or $8 for 3-4 pierogis smothered in cheese friendly? I don't think anywhere will ever be cool enough for me to accept paying that if I'm not eating at the restaurant of a world-famous chef. 

Overall I recommend. This is a great place if you like music and a few drinks, but eat a filling dinner beforehand."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for business and decided to walk across the river to this place after reading about the sweet meat burger here on Yelp.  I had to have it, two homemade glazed donuts holding a cooked to order burger with bacon.  

I have to admit, I didn't eat the whole burger because it was huge.  The bacon sopped up the donut glaze and became candied bacon.  THAT is something the place should sell, candied bacon!

Overall, if you're looking for a fun place to go, a nice area to walk around and if you pick the right day you may have the opportunity to take advantage of open mic night.

Glad I went."}
{"text":"I am in town for a conference and we went here to get dinner and listen to the live jazz band. The food was incredible and the band was absolutely wonderful. During dinner the service was pretty slow and the food took a while to come out but the staff was very friendly and the food was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went for the Sunday drag brunch which was really fun. I've been to some other drag shows where the performers actually sang. Here they lip-synched but they were quite good. The food here though is really nothing to write home about. It's not a place I would come simply for dinner. It was edible but not memorable by a longshot."}
{"text":"Oh boy... Had only I known what I was getting into, perhaps I could have better prepared myself for this place. Then again, I seriously doubt one can prepare one's self for the indulgence of the Sweet Meat Burger. This candied-bacon burger, served up on a glazed donut bun, is not for the faint of heart. Literally, if you have heart problems, you probably shouldn't even be thinking about this thing. I had to stop and think about how to approach it. Pick it up and it'll glaze your hands like a Krispy Kreme; eat it with a fork and, well... you'll be known as the guy that eats burgers with a fork. Either way you choose to proceed, grab that tomato and lettuce and just toss them aside! Vegetables will only get in the way of your rising cholesterol.  

I love the concept and and the execution of James Street Gastropub. The atmosphere is great and uniquely sets itself apart from the standard restaurant choices in the area.  Service was on point (for the most part). We never had to ask for a refill for our drinks.  As it was our first time here, I would have liked to be shown to a seat; rather we were told to just find a booth or a table. There was also an awkward moment when another employee interrupted our waitress as she was wrapping up with us. Despite that, we appreciated the attention and recommendations we received. 

The speakeasy is downstairs below the dining room, and although we didn't have the opportunity to explore, my imagination likes to think it's a pretty cool place. Their signage suggests they have live music in the evenings.  

We will definitely find some time to make a return trip and experience more of what they have to offer. I recommend giving them a try if you're in the area. 

Quick tip: there's is a customer parking area on the side of the building, meaning there's no need to fight for an on-street spot!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice recently in the last month, each time was for lunch.  

I am a big fan of places that have some character and aren't just plastered with huge TVs and cheesy 'burgh flare on the walls.  The bar in the spot is beautiful.  The bar area has an interesting set up which I have never seen before (and i have been to a lot of bars).  The there is a divider with elevated two person booths.  hmmm. 

The menu has some interesting options nothing that I would really classify as gastropub-esque but good options.   I got a salad with fried portabella's and a turkey burger the last time i was there.  The salad was really good.  The portion was decent as well, its always the worst when you try and be healthy but you are just given a cup a lettuce.  The burger was good, not great.  She did ask me \"how i wanted my burger cooked\" which was a little scary meaning it was a turkey burger.  I wish the turkey burger had a little more flavor, i had to salt, pepper, red hot, the hell out of it.  Fries are an upcharge as well.  meh. 

My only big gripe is the slow service.  Don't get me wrong the service is friendly but sooo slooooww.  The second time I went it was for some bloodys and burgers but I think it took 20 minutes to get our first drink. You know when you need that bloody mary, its feels like ages!  I think part of the problem is there is one server for lunch who is also the bartender.  Both times I was there the slow service was an issue. 

Pros: Classic interior, neighborhood feel, larger menu, full bar

Cons: Slow service, food is good, not amazing. 

Overall:  I am in this neck of the woods a lot so I will def be back.  


I would love to see them start doing brunch.  Also, I hear they have a trivia night which would be fun."}
{"text":"We went here for a drag show. The food was really bland and needed salt, but there wasn't any on the tables, and the waitress brought our food and then didn't come back until she brought the bill. The drag show was great tho."}
{"text":"This place... this place.

Upstairs is like a 100year-old Saloon. Relatively well lit, the ceilings are high, and the woodwork dark. It's a bit like Cheers - a corner bar, with a decent sized bar and a good seating area. It's clean and feel comfortable, but a little too open.

Downstairs is the real treat. 

You walk down a corridor, and then down a flight of carpeted stairs into the bar I would own if i could. A room with small, but sufficient tables, a small stage (perfect for jazz ensambles, small bands, or Stand-Up Comedy), several booths, and a nice small bar that can probably seat 12 or so patrons. 

This room is like a time capsule, as if someone lifted everything amazing about the 1950's nightlife, and removed the nicotine from the air. You almost feel that Tony Bennet or Old Blue Eyes himself could wander in with his fedora tilted to the side, in a skinny tie and suit, grab himself a manhattan and start crooning. 

The beers are all craft, and the Guinness (or mine at least) is always served in the right glass. Beers aren't cheap, per se, but they are high quality than you'd find in most bars. I've not had much of the food here, but what I have has been wonderful. Two words: Grilled Wings. 

This is a great place, and I wish it was in walking distance of my home. The North Side has a reputation for being sketchy, but this place has it's own parking lot, and makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"Located just across the river, from downtown, we visited while on a train layover. Based on Yelp recommendations and a thirst for craft beer, we sought it out. Upon entry, we were greater by a mix of local bar and jazz club. 

More than half full, the restaurant was rather loud for  a Monday night but service was prompt. Sharon reviewed the beer list and specials and offered numerous suggestions.

We began with spinach artichoke dip although the menu read artichoke dip AND chefs choice hummus, we were told it was a misprint and it was OR. it was served was, not hot, with celery, pita chips, and bell pepper. OK, but nothing to write home about and definitely worth $9. 

Dinner was a turkey burger for me, with chips, for me and steak sandwich with onion rings for my wife. Both were fine but chips were greasy and a little stale.

Enjoyed Rogue Imperial Stout, on draft. Overall, a decent meal but not likely to make a return visit."}
{"text":"I live in James street and this Pub is the best , excellent service , excellent bartenders ,  I go almost every night , and i love their fish and chips and the music is fantastic , Ambiance   best of the best master of the sky   !!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can easily tell you this review is too easy to write.  Everything I had here was amazing.  This easily has became the to-be spot for me.

The building has a lot of history in it.  The owner took lots of old photo of performers and hanged them all the wall.  The atmosphere is awesome for any type of mood you're into for the night.  You got the bar with plasma tv and slightly divided from the actual dining area.  They also hold recently special performances downstairs.  So it is great for when you wanna go somewhere to watch sports, bring a date, or just spend a casual night listening to artists.

There were two dishes I tasted that I would have never ordered.  Cajun Oysters and Tiny Tunas.  I am not a big fan of oysters but this one was awesome.  It didn't taste like oysters.  The Tiny Tunas had a side of wasabi/mayo which tasted nothing like the dreaded wasabi.  The tuna was also perfectly cooked where it wasn't overcooked but still didn't taste raw.

I moved to Pittsburgh two years ago and still didn't get why pierogies are so popular until I came here.  The pierogies here made. me. understand.

My favorite dishes are the Twisted Chicken, Crab Cakes, and Sweet Meat.   The crab cakes were 90% meat.  Straight up meat.  Awesome.

The twisted chicken is your chicken/bacon sandwich but on a pretzel bun.  The pretzel bun has a nice sweetness to it.  The chicken was a thick piece of meat.  I honestly don't get how they can sell this thing so cheap.

The show stopper is the Sweet Meat.  The Sweet Meat is basically a hamburger with candied bacon in between glazed donut buns.  Seriously, it is not the healthiest thing in the world but it is the tastiest thing I've had in a long while.

I've had the pleasure to talk to everyone that runs the place.  The owner, the owner's son, the co-owner, the executive chief.  They're regular people, not investment bankers.  If you want a local restaurant to succeed, choose this one.  They're amazingly nice people.  

I just checked out their menu online and there's lots of variety of different food.  I can't wait to go back there.  Look at their prices too.  You can't beat getting quality food for this price.

Overall, stop reading and go try the place NOW."}
{"text":"Based on my experience during a quiet workday during lunch, I think this is a pretty decent place; I came here recently with some coworkers for lunch and really enjoyed my time here. 

The place was pretty empty - I bet this is not the case during evenings and weekends - so my table could talk at ease without having to yell at each other over other customers or loud TVs and music. Always a plus!

Everyone overall received very delicious looking dishes; I personally would have enjoyed more crabcake on my crabcake sandwich - there was more bread than meat and I ended up having 1/4 of a bun left when I finished the best part of the sandwich - but hey, the fries were pretty darn delicious, so kudos for that.

I'd definitely come back seeing as everyone else enjoyed their meals, but will not ordering the crabcake sandwich again; too disappointing. I also want to come back to try a drink or two, seeing as lunch during a workday is not the ideal time to order a beer - hopefully I get to do that soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around! Great place to see live music and enjoy delicious food ! 15 different craft beers on draft at all times. Three floors to choose from, with each floor featuring live music almost every night. (Closed Mondays)"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! I highly recommend the Spicy Turkey Wrap and Mac and Cheese! Loved them! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Great speakeasy music, but pricy food and weird rule about sitting at table (15 min per person) on jazz jam night , so 30 buck min if me and my gal wanna go out on A Tuesday or we sit at bar wit no min and have huge wall between us and music.... Kinda sucks when other areas open jam night  such as club cafe is southside has no cover or minimum to sit at table ... Kinda gave me feel of a uppity place when I was asked to spend more money or move.. Like poor people sit in crappy seats even though their are tons of tables open"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. 
The place hosts some great bands, probably their biggest redeeming factor. However, everything they sell is crazy expensive for no reason, all flash and no substance. I ordered their \"special\" mac'n'cheese with buffalo chicken. It was incredibly sad; the \"3-cheese blend\" tasted powered and the buffalo chicken was obviously from a freezer bag. I also paid around $15. However, my boyfriend ordered the meatloaf with creamed corn, and that was delicious. Maybe I just picked a bad dish. 
They do have a great beer selection, but again, costs way too much. 
Also the decorations of the place are kitschy and try way too hard. The vibe is always hit or miss according to the day. Meh."}
{"text":"This place has great food and I love the atmosphere.  We have been there a couple times for Friday night swing dancing and absolutely loved it.  The drinks are great too!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great and everyone is super friendly. They held a table for six about 45 minutes on a Saturday night while we waited for our party to arrive. That in combination with the amazing cocktails is the only reason they are getting three stars. The dark and stormy and the lemon drop were beyond amazing. 

The food was very average. The one thing that really bugged me was my med rare burger. I always order my burgers well done. I assume if they don't ask how I want it cooked it will be somewhere between med and well. This burger was bloody. Gross. I would've sent it back but it took an hour to make the the first time, and the waitress was no where to be found. Luckily the fries were good. 

I may return for cocktails but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I guess I'm just used to a more interesting menu when I hear \"gastropub\" and I didn't see anything that really stood out besides the donut burger and that just sounded silly and unappetizing. 

We started with cocktails, which were GREAT. I got a mint julep that was perfect. Pretend boyfriend got his signature dirty martini on the rocks. He's picky about his martini and he seemed to like it just fine.

We were starving and cold after having walked a bit to get here. So we started with some appetizers of the beer soaked potato chips and wings. Both were pretty darn good and I loved the dipping sauces that came with the chips. 

It was decided that we would just share an entree after devouring our apps. We chose the fish and chips. Nothing too remarkable there. Just fish and chips. Kinda disappointing that the cole slaw that was described on the menu never came. (But to be fair, we didn't ask either.) I guess it should just be there if it's on the menu. 

James Street has a decent selection of brews. We got a few and sipped them while listening to the cheesy jazz (it was pretty bad, assuming because it was a band of really young kids) coming up from the basement. 

The atmosphere here is pretty cool. It almost looks like it was a church at one time. The furniture just didn't go with the rest of the decor though. There was just something lacking. Not like that's a huge deal.... it just felt like *something* was missing.  

Service was stellar. We loved our server, Kim. She was adorable and sweet."}
{"text":"Stopped in unplanned and pleasantly surprised. Solid craft beer list. I had the Romano pork Chop with risotto.  It was moist and tasty. I am a risotto snob and this was done just right. We had a crabtini appetizer which the cilantro and sea salt rim was exceptional. Only comment was it was loud so hard for conversation but had a great vibe for fun."}
{"text":"Went for the jazz night this weekend, did not dissapoint! 

The speakeasy is a nice comfortable atmosphere that can be intimate enough to spend with a date or catch someones eye. The crowd is fairly diverse from young twenty somethings to older couples. Talked with one of the bartenders for a while, really  nice fellow. They also have real bartenders that know how to mix a drink as opposed to the faux bartenders promenading as high school cheerleaders from yesteryear that dont know what goes in a Manhattan."}
{"text":"The food and beverages are fantastic--no question about it. This USED to be my favorite neighborhood bar; my last visit soured me so much, I'll never return. 

I ordered a Johnnie Walker Black and a small plate of buffalo Mac. The food was delicious...but my bill was $30!!! For ONE DRINK and a small plate!! I was charged $2.50 because I ordered my drink on the rocks, and they upcharged me for ICE. The bartender claimed that the charge was due to \"extra\" liquor that was added to the drink to compensate for the ice. It wasn't a significant amount and I wasn't informed that that \"on the rocks charges\" would be added until I received my check.

The mac and cheese was also as duplicitous. The menu makes it seems that buffalo chicken mac is $6, but that's actually in addition the flat $8 that they charge for the mac itself. My mac and cheese was $14 (for a \"small plate\"!!) and my single JW Black, a middle shelf scotch at best, was $11.50!!! With tax etc, my total was almost $30!!! I am absolutely livid. Also, it's hot as HELL in there because there's no AC. I don't recommend James St, unless you wear a swimsuit and take an attorney to review the menu prior to ordering. I spent far too much for an app and a drink. I'll take my business to an honest establishment next time."}
{"text":"Second visit to the James St. PUB.  The atmosphere is great! Good beer selection and the food is really good. If you visit the speakeasy downstairs you can get a great cocktail and listen to some really good jazz. Definitely worth the stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"There's nothing bad about this place.  Just not great.  We came on a Saturday night and the place was jamming pretty good.  We did have a reservation in the restaurant area and were promptly sat.  The server greeted us asking if we were interested in hearing the draft list.  We obliged and tried to catch the beers she was clearly in a hurry to get thru.  I don't know about you, but I much prefer a list.  Now, in a place like this that has such a high turnover draft rate, that is sometimes a difficult feat.  I get it!  Anyway, nice selection by both draft and bottle.  Cocktails looked pretty darn good as well.  

We started with pierogies, tequila lime wings, and the onion rings.  The pierogies were alright, but just way too smothered in sour cream.  And I like sour cream.  The wing flavor was very blah.  The wings themselves were good, a crispy skin but not dried out.  We could have used some ranch or blue for the celery.  And the onion rings were awesome.  But please just give me a bottle of ketchup.  I really don't want your 1oz paper cup.  

For dinner I had the pulled pork sandwich.  It was great.  The sauce was a bit tangy, so beware if you don't like spicy stuff, and the meat was very tender.  However, I never got my cole slaw.  I was really looing forward to this.  And the server was too busy to even flag down.  I ordered the French fries as the side and they were gross.  they were fresh cut, but soggy and dirty tasting.  The homemade chips I stole off other plates were very good.  Everyone else had burgers and everyone seemed happy.  

For dessert we had the crème brulee and the apple tart.  Both were very good.  

All and all just kinda middle of the road.  I would like to check out the speakeasy in the basement at some point.  Sounds as though you need a reservation for that as well."}
{"text":"I went for dinner at 4 pm on a Saturday.  We were easily sat in the cool upper bar area.  I was drawn to the Build Your Own mac and cheese.  WHAT?//??  That is like a dream come true.   (But again..see Condados tacos review \"You are one pick away from disaster\" when you can make your own.)  So i stayed pretty simple.  Meatloaf bites (essentially a slice of meatloaf cut into bites) and broccoli.  I had a whole winter night before the fire meal idea in my mind on a summer night.  And, let me tell you.... that combo was pretty great.  The portion was huge and I only ate half.  (the left overs were just as good, maybe a little better).  Service was prompt and authentic.  I will be back to make my winter night dream come true."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!!! My husband and I joined some friends for their 10 year anniversary and it was an absolutely great experience. The waitress was very nice patient and gave us lots of input on what was good and was not. My husband had the meatloaf, I had the buttermilk friend chicken as did my friend and her husband had the gumbo. With the live entertainment and ambiance with dim lighting, it was romantic, intimate and very relaxing listening to the jazz artists of the evening. The food was absolute stupendous!!! The mac n cheese, the white cheddar grits, the collard greens all were seasoned well and o so tasty! This is now my husband and mines favorite place and we plan to patron this place at least once a month for our date nights. Thank u Gastropub for the great romantic evening!!!!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place, which was within walking distance from where we were staying. I went with a group of four on a Friday night for drinks and a snack at the bar upstairs. I got some creamy raspberry and vodka concoction, which was delicious. The guys tried some interesting beers and were offered a sample of another they wanted to try. I got the pierogies, which were very good, and then we headed out.

The next day, we were back for another snack while our friends were having some down time. I got the \"Suds and Spuds\", which I've gotta say was about the most delicious snack I've ever had - homemade beer soaked potato chips with tomato relish, cheddar sour cream, and spicy bacon ranch dipping sauces. Needless to say, we left quite jealous that we don't live in Pittsburgh and won't get to become regulars. The drinks aren't cheap, but if I lived in the area, I could easily see myself there at least once or twice a month."}
{"text":"Based on ambiance and cool factor alone, I give this place 5 stars. I walked in the front door on a Friday night and followed my ears to the basement. I walk into a great sax solo and jazz performance; keys, drums, bass. I go the bar, order a sazerac and listen amidst OG jazz cats in fedoras and stingy brims. They talk about jazz greats all night, I enjoy the closest thing to a time/era machine I can get."}
{"text":"I am giving James Street Speakeasy two additional stars.  One of the owners Adam took the time to comment on my review and I appreciate that kind of involvement.

Hell maybe I will try back just not on a Sunday if I want steak!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the last time I was here just a few months ago! Drink menu has changed as has the food menu. Skip the appetizers, nothing I'd have again. I got a seasonal steak item - prime rib eye. It was aged and very tender.  The horseradish latkes were gross. Soggy and completely unappetizing. Buttermilk chicken was crispy and buttery. Smashed redskins...yum!  Mac and cheese was not  hot and bubbly, seemed like they skipped a step and did not toast... Meh. Wish it was as good as the last time!!"}
{"text":"\"Good for kids:  no\"???????  Are we talking about the same restaurant?  This is one of my 6-year-olds favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Every staff member we've interacted with at James Street is great with kids:  patient, funny, and willing to accommodate weird kid-requests.  On one visit, my daughter requested a chocolate chip cookie for dessert (at the beginning of our meal) and our server said they were out of them.  Then, as we finished eating, she emerged from the kitchen with a single, piping hot, gooey chocolate chip cookie.  \"The chef said he'd make one just for you tonight,\" she said.  Sure, someone just thawed out and baked some frozen cookie dough--- but it made my daughter's night and permanently ensconced James St. In her heart.  
 
We've never taken advantage of this deal, but on Monday nights, you get a free kids' meal with an order of an entree!

The food here is consistently good and some of it is absolutely delicious.  We love the onion rings, the grits appetizer, and the grilled vegetable sandwich.  And the beer menu is fantastic!

The live music does get loud even in the upstairs seating area, but it's nothing like the blaring televisions or piped-in recorded music that often ruins meals at chain restaurants.  Even my parents, who ALWAYS complain about the noise at restaurants, find the noise level here to be tolerable and easy to have a conversation over.  And if you're there because of the music... even better.

We don't choose James Street when we're in a hurry, but why would you want to hurry here?  This is a place to linger, talk, laugh as loudly as you want to, and relax with friends and family.  I'm willing to wait a little longer for food that is fresh and well prepared.  

Every neighborhood needs a restaurant like James Street!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch yesterday. It was not very busy. I opted for the breakfast casserole, which was accompanied by a side salad. When I ordered, I asked the server if there were mushrooms in the salad. (Not a fan of mushrooms here... They make my skin crawl.) She said there were not, so I was happy. But when the meal came, there were mushrooms in the breakfast casserole, Which was not listed on the menu.

I'm not sure if the cook added them on a whim... Had some mushrooms to use up? So maybe the server didn't even realize they were in it. Or if that is something that happens frequently, she should have known, or they should change the menu to reflect that mushrooms are in it."}
{"text":"I want to talk about James Street as a Jazz and dance venue.  I went to hear their Charles Mingus Festival this past weekend and was amazed by the musicianship and quality of the sound.  This is a great club to hear live Jazz, they have marvelous musicians and a good stage.  I have also been upstairs to dance to live music and that's a lot of fun.  The stage upstairs is very narrow, but somehow the musicians get it to work.  The dance floor is excellent, this is the best club in town for swing dancing.  The staff works really hard, even when the club is packed with people."}
{"text":"If u love live music, want drinks and good food this is the place. They have 3 levels. I love the Speakeasy. Its the lower level it offers free admission and u can order drinks and food. The shrimp po boy sandwich ia delicious and so are the pipebombs on the appetizer menu. The service is ok or good....it gets crowded so u have to be patient at times.  They have different bands and they are great. One a year they have a Jazz festival. A different band every hour from 1pm til 2 am. It's packed but a good time. Great for a date, girls night out or a night out with your music loving parents."}
{"text":"We went here last Saturday night for a show, and we're looking forward to a fun night. Unfortunately, the upstairs venue space was closed and we learned that the concert would be in the basement space. We headed on down, and found all tables and bar spaces taken. Undaunted and wanting to hear our friend play, we stationed ourselves at the edge of the bar to get the attention of a bartender. One grumpy older bartender promptly told us he would not serve us at that location at the bar, as it is behind a table. So, we moved around to the front. Happily we were assisted by a much more pleasant young woman. I ordered a mixed drink made with cider, fresh squeezed lemon, and amaro, and it was quite refreshing on a hot evening. We had to drink and stand for half of the show, which was rather annoying. People were talking over the performers, and we couldn't tell how many people came to see the show and how many just stumbled upon it. We were finally able to colonize a table later in the evening, and decided to restart the night! Our waiter was quick and efficient, and we enjoyed the music from our new location. I was happy to see wines from Pittsburgh Winery, and enjoyed the White Blend. We decided against any food for the evening. 

I hope that the upstairs space opens soon; until then I might wait to attend a concert again or at least make sure I request a table in advance."}
{"text":"Completed our 3rd trip here within 4 months. This trip included their awesome Veggie Fries with the addition of the Cajun Wings. As other people have stated VERY good wings.
  This recent trip I decided to try the house special \"Sweet Meat\" Burger... Wow!   What a unique and tasty flavor combination. The glazed donut type bun and sweet onion mayo along with Angus burger and smokey bacon?!?!  Happiness!!  Great beers and our waiter was terrific as always! We love this place!!"}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch.  They have great steak salads and I also usually get there soup and sammy special.  In the evenings they have jazz music (check the schedule) in the speak easy downstairs.  They even have swing dancing in the ballroom upstairs on Fridays.  Beers on tap are always changing and they have an even bigger selection bottled in the cooler.  For dinner I suggest the meatloaf but they make a great pulled pork sandwich too.  Stop in on Tuesday for open stage jazz nights which brings out the best jazz players in the city."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for the first time last week for the Plant Nite event. It was held in their upstairs area- which wasn't too big, but cozy, and had a bar and a decent size stage. Although they specialize in cocktails, I am not much of a liquor drinker, so I paid attention to their wine and beer list. Their draft list was decent- lots of local brews. I was really impressed that their wine list also consisted of local wineries- I had two white blends from Pittsburgh winery.  

After the event, my friend and I were super hungry and were seated in the restaurant area downstairs, near the band. We really enjoyed the music and the service was great as well. I ordered the twisted chicken sandwich with a side of potato salad. My friend ordered a burger. Our food was delicious- the potato salad tasted fresh and was very flavorful, and the chicken sandwich was packed with flavor. I loved the pretzel bun, peppered bacon and the candied red onion. 

Overall, we had a great time. I plan on paying more attention to their events/bands and taking my boyfriend on a date here soon!"}
{"text":"James St Pub is a fantastic addition to the North Side. The owners have done a really great job bringing all of the historic accents of the building back to life and creating a classy, but not stuffy bar and dining area. The bar side is slim and can fit about 10 people at the bar. There are also 6 2 person booths on that side. The bar provides about 8 draft beers most of which are micros. The beers run from $4-5.50. 

My friends and I split an order of wings (so-so, they needed more sauce) and we all had burgers. The food was really tasty and cooked exactly to order. I'm excited to come back and try the rest of their menu. My tab for 2 beers, 1/2 an order of wings, and a blue cheese burger was $24. 

I'm going back on Friday night to check out the jazz show in their down stairs speak easy. They have an open mic on Wednesday nights and live jazz Friday through Sunday."}
{"text":"Shhh... Food Hounds.... Brimstone here to tell you about a spot deep in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that can NOT be kept a secret!  I'm talking about a restaurant that quickly made their way into my personal Top Ten Tidbits of all time... the James Street Gastropub & Speakeasy!  Meanwhile, the history behind the location is fantasmic!  This building was actually an extremely popular speakeasy during the prohibition where patrons could eat, drink, engage in sexual activities and simply be merry without being caught by the authorities. Set in a predominantly residential neighborhood, James Street is ultimately a hidden prize off the beaten path; but one WELL worth seeking out!  

The ambiance of the main floor offers a throwback to the old Louisiana Blues clubs; but with a modern swagger while downstairs... a full blown jazz/blues club complete with a bar, stage and talented group of instrumentalists. As far as the food is concerned, the menu is vast and eclectic; there is something for everyone... and then some!  They even have a full menu for the little ones (Kids eat FREE on Monday's after 4pm).  We started out with a variety of items from the choice of appetizers.  The Crab Cakes were HUGE, extremely tasty and not overly fishy - while the lemon pepper remoulade does not overpower this solid piece of heaven!  Cajun Oysters were Jumbo Oysters with a Cajun spiced breading that were cooked to perfection - leaving each morsel a flaky, tender and outstanding work of art!  Mild spices from the seasoning work in delicious harmony with the BOSS of a creamy horseradish sauce.

Then there were the Pipe Bombs... a crispy wonton stuffed with flank steak, jalapenos and pepper jack cheese! WIN!  The flavor behavior was insane and when paired with their Guiness steak sauce, they exploded with deliciousness.  The Suds & Spuds is great for a group to nosh on.  Consisting of thin beer soaked Idaho potato chips with tomato relish, cheddar sour cream and get this... spicy BACON ranch dipping sauce - a spicy-kick with a hint of smokey bacon which fared very well with the tasty, lightly seasoned chips.  If you didn't know already, the Cheddar Sour Cream is Award Winning; thick, creamy, Mmm CHEESE!  We chose 3 different styles of their Wings. The Peanut Butter, Beer & Molasses was a kiss of pb with just a hint of everything else; made a great combo.  The Habanero Jelly was kick-a$$!  Sweet spice and not over sauced, perfect.  As for the Cajun Dry Rub wings... the seasoning was fabulous and the wings themselves were crunchy on the outside and juicy within.  

We then had a burger known as Sweet Meat; quite possibly the BEST burger I've ever tasted mostly due to its incredible uniqueness!  Let me break this down for all of you reading at home... a thick, juicy burger with a creamy sweet onion mayo - nestled between the most incredible 'DONUT BUN' which was more doughy than cakey - then adorned with CANDIED BACON.  If that weren't enough, more bacon is laid carefully on the top for good measure along with a light glaze of icing that would ultimately assist this creation of love down my wanton gullet! 

Next was the Double Trouble; a two 8oz patty mountain of juicy meat-a-tarian love topped with a fried egg, crispy bacon, onion straws, chipotle mayo and buckets of yumm!  We had the Pulled Pork which literally melts in your mouth.  The insane flavor behavior that comes from the lightly seasoned pork accentuates the sweet and slightly smoky taste of the sauce. The Triple Fried Fries would be the death of me if I lived nearby... freshly cut fries done crispy without losing the natural flavor of the potato itself, lightly salted and very pleasing to the pallet. Onion Rings, beer battered in a homemade batter blend - hefty portion of LARGE onions; fantastic.  The Chicken Fried Steak was a largely portioned platter with a moist, hand breaded filet of meat wrapped with peppered bacon and doused with their delicious gravy. Meanwhile, the gravy had a hint of cheddar cheese with yet again thick chunks of bacon in it.

Mac & Cheese was thick, creamy, cheesy and very satisfying!  The Twisted Chicken was served on a pretzel bun and is an incredible meal.  Juicy chicken with combined flavor of bacon, candied sweet red onions and drizzled cheddar cheese - it creates a stupendous salty/sweet combo.  We topped off the dining experience with their Singing the Blues Burger... a thick Black Angus burger topped with gorgonzola and crispy bacon on a light and fluffy bun.  The Angus is so tender that it melts like butter in your mouth; tender, succulent and salty.

As if we could move after all of the food, out came dessert! Made from scratch, the Carrot Cake was possibly one of the best I've ever had. The Crème Brulee was simply heavenly and was a perfect end to an amazing meal - very rich and creamy; there was a kiss of yummy in every bite!  All in all, it would be a shame for anyone to miss out on this incredible location."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good show. Didn't go to the restaurant but attended a show upstairs."}
{"text":"I've really been loving this place lately. The food is pretty fantastic. Try out the mac and cheese and Twisted Chicken Sandwich is a must try. We had wings one night for wing night. It was BOGO wings with a nice selection. I am also always able to find a good beer there to try. Prices are a bit high, but I think on the North Side they have to do that to keep out the bad crowd.

I really want to go back for open mic night. I hear it's awesome. Every other Tuesday I believe, in the downstairs area."}
{"text":"Good burgers and amazing beer selection.  Really liked the live jazz band!"}
{"text":"I visited last night with a friend for dinner at around 6pm.  I received a pack of City Dining Cards for Christmas, and she picked this place from among the options that I offered, since she'd heard good things about it.  I was also interested in trying it out, given the speakeasy ambiance and the interesting-looking Cajun menu options.

Having previewed the menu ahead of time, I decided to get the Cajun shrimp and grits, since this is a classic Cajun dish, and I haven't had it previously.  It came with 5 shrimp (see photo) seasoned with Cajun seasonings that gave them a nice spicy kick.  The majority of this entree was vegetables and grits.  Aside from the spices on the shrimp, the word I'd use to describe this dish is \"inoffensive.\"  While nothing was wrong with it, per se, it just wasn't very exciting--in this respect, it was similar to something you'd see at Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday.  For a $19 entree at a place billing itself as a gastropub, I expect more pizzazz--and more shrimp!

I didn't try my friend's po' boy because I had a (very good) shrimp po' boy the day before for lunch.  She enjoyed it, this being the first time she'd had a po' boy.  It was $13, which I felt was also on the pricy side, esp. for a sandwich. It came with a side of house made chips, which I sampled, that I felt were a bit overdone.  In addition to our food, we each had a drink (hard cider for me, beer for her).  Both our drinks ran $6, which I felt was also on the expensive side, but hers was discounted to $4, which I felt was more typical.

The one thing that really shined about our experience was our waiter's personality.  He was humorous and interactive in a good way, which is always a nice, unexpected bonus.  We were seated in the booth section on the ground floor next to the bar, and I found the ambiance overall to be pretty bland, reminiscent of a chain casual dining restaurant.  I later found out that the speakeasy, where the live music is hosted, is downstairs, so perhaps this has a better ambiance.  I'd be willing to return at some point just for drinks to check it out.

Overall, while I have no real complaints about our experience except the inflated prices, nothing really stood out about it, aside from our waiter's personality. In a city with as many great dining options as PGH, restaurants really need to stand out to do a good business.  If the sparsely populated dining room and bar that we encountered at prime time on a Sat. evening is par for the course, this is evidence that the locals recognize this place's shortcomings in this regard.  3.5 stars.

P.S. Shrimp and grits are available for half the price nearby at Carmi on Western Ave.  I haven't tried them there, but if the fried chicken I had there is any indication, I'll be willing to bet that they're good!"}
{"text":"My mom and I ended up here for dinner to use a City Dining Card and it was a pleasant surprise! It's in such a quaint part of the North Side and I was shocked I had never been here before. 

The atmosphere was pretty down-to-earth, low key. The staff was really friendly upon us entering and sat us right away. I also was surprised to see that they change the table cloth after each seating. Everything was clean and the wall photos of musicians were really cool. 

The food was pretty good. I had the crab cake sandwich and my mom had the shrimp po boy with a side salad. I'd give my crab cake a 3 out of 5 - it wasn't my favorite but it was decent. My mom really enjoyed her sandwich but didn't eat her whole bun as it was a little over-powering to the shrimp itself. She ended up finishing the shrimp on its own. 

We didn't get a chance to stay for the live music that goes on downstairs in the speakeasy part of the restaurant, but I'm hoping next time maybe it will be a good spot to just stop and have a drink and listen to live music after dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"First, let me say that this was my first outing after finding out my new dietary restriction.  I am so happy we ended up here because they were so accommodating to my needs.  

From the moment we walked in we were greeted with warm...good thing too, as it was freezing outside.  We arrived before the dinner rush and after the lunch rush had ended.  It was more like a happy hour crowd, read that as the bar was filled, but the dining area was not.  We opted for the two seater booth that kind of overlooks the whole place.  We were able to see the bar clearly, over top all the other patrons heads, and we were able to peer down into the dining area.  These seats give you the right respective to just how enormous this place is.  Huge plus that we sat here, we were able to see the draft selections and really didn't have to ask our server (I believe her name was Sharon, if not, I'm sorry, but you were terrific).

We started off with an appetizer, the Veggie Fries.  Good combination of veggies I would have never put together, coated and then deep fried.  However, I'm not a mushroom person, therefore I about gagged when I got to that one.  The dipping sauces that accompany were great, I couldn't get enough of the spicy bacon one, I wanted a bottle of that to come home with me.

For my main course I stuck with a burger.  Turkey burger to be precise.  Cooked perfectly, with a little bit of a crust on the outside and tender on the inside.  Topped with red onions, sprouts, Muenster cheese, and a sweet tomato guacamole.  My god, that guacamole was amazing, I did NOT add anything to the burger, no need for condiments on this one.  I decided to upgrade to the hand cut fries, good choice.  Lightly seasoned, and fried in soybean oil (thank you again to Sharon, she went back to check it wasn't peanut or corn oil).  My friend ordered the Grilled Veggie, and I heard no complaints from her way.

We both opted for a beer as well, a very nice mixture of beers on tap and in the can.

As for the price tag, not too shabby.  We expected it to actually be more because the food was so good, but were pleasantly surprised at the end of our meal.

Tip: Do a little research for parking before you come this way.  I had no clue as to where this was or how parking is done.  Most of the parking right near here is residential permit parking between certain hours.  Half a block away is a public parking lot, also there is parking on Western Ave. which is also half a block away."}
{"text":"Dined here tonight before a concert at MCG.  We decided to split their Twisted Chicken sandwich, which comes with a pretzel bun.  We've both had it before and liked it.  Since that didn't sound filling enough, we decided to split an order of their pierogi appetizer.  The order consisted of three large Sautéed potato pierogies, with delicious caramelized onions, and cheddar sour cream sauce.  We will order those again.  The Twisted chicken was very good, as it had been during previous visits.  My wife had a glass of wine (a nice pour) and I had two wonderful craft brews from their fairly extensive beer list.  Since we had some time to kill, and weren't too stuffed, we ordered a creme brûlée to share, thinking it would come out quickly, and expecting it to be smallish.  Wrong on both counts.  It was tasty though.  Overall, service was quite good, and did I mention the extensive beer list?"}
{"text":"We have been to the restaurant three times and had consistently good service and food. The range of food is sufficient for us, but I would like to see more entrees that are vegetarian and a few items that are indicated as gluten free, etc.  I had one dinner entree and two different sandwiches. All were delicious, the portions were generous and attractively served. The servers were flexible (we ordered mac and cheese as an appetizer b/c its so good.)  

The decor is great, the menus are fun and ambiance is comfortable. I love that there's live music available. The staff are attentive and their tableside manners improved dramatically - for these prices, I want me food to be boxed rather than have a styrofoam container placed on my table for me to fill. That has changed for the better. 

We will continue to patronize as our budget allows. The sandwiches really do make for an affordable night out and hopefully still subsidize their operating costs."}
{"text":"Best Greens I've ever had. Great service and great food. Had the buttermilk chicken and grits.  Had to try the fried green tomatoes and they did not disapoint.."}
{"text":"I have a general philosophy when it comes to breaking up with men: If he breaks your heart, get your best friend, get in the damn car, and drive until it doesn't hurt anymore. Then get some delicious food when you get where ever you landed. 

Clearly, my most recent ex wasn't significant enough to take me across the country, but I did get to Pittsburgh before I felt better (about a 2 hour drive from AK-Rowdy). Lucky I did too, because James Street Gastropub was... pardon my yankee.... fucking fantastic.

Now. If restaurants were like men, this restaurant would be tall, sturdily built, a southern accent, a wicked smile, and a really big.....menu.

I had the pipe bombs (flank steak, jalapenos, and did you say Guinness sauce?!), the spinach salad, the buttermilk fried chicken with grits and greens, and creme brulee to fully heal my poor broken heart.

Pipe bombs were fantastic and wicked. I wish they had given me more, but, well, ya know, I still had a salad coming and a meal...and dessert. The wonton wrapper was super crispy and the oil they were fried in was clearly fresh. I'll admit to sticking my fingers in the Guinness steak sauce. 

Normally, salads are kind of a 'meh' affair. Just a way to make you feel better about ordering fried chicken. But this salad was seriously good. The roasted strawberry vinaigrette was a surprise, a very pleasant one.

I'm going to tell you something top secret. One of my best friends knows her fried chicken and, up until this point, made the best fried chicken I've ever had, but....come a little closer, I'm not saying this above a whisper....theirs is better. I didn't know what to expect with chicken breast, it usually comes out a bit too dry for my tastes, mostly because it's severely overcooked, but theirs was perfect. Seriously moist with a crunchy, flavorful crust that stuck to the breast instead of flaking off. And cheese grits with greens....slap yo momma good (I don't have a clue where I picked up that phrase. I'm a Texan, and that is not a part of our vernacular.... Though, if you really want to be particular, neither is the word 'vernacular'). 

Okay. The creme brulee was good. Solid dessert made right. But what I really wanted at the end of that meal was a slice of peach pie. Or sweet potato pie. Preferably peach, but I'll take what I can get.

Service-wise, our waiter was kick ass. I should have written this review when I went almost two months ago now....because I can't remember his name. It was a J-name I think, and he had to spell it because I'm a total derp when it comes to names. Anyways, he was a complete sweetheart and kept the glasses full and even made a fresh pot of coffee for me when I asked for a cup even though I told him not to worry about it. (HAH! Read someone else's review, the gentleman in question is Jarrett!)"}
{"text":"First off, I had a lot of expectations coming into this place. My wife and I enjoy jazz music and I have never been to a place that offers live jazz. In my mind I was was expecting this place to be like the jazz club in one of my favorite movies \"That Thing You Do\", The Blue Dot, a smokey jazz club with lots of neon. James Street is definitely not that place. It is, however, an awesome restaurant

When we walked into the 19th century building we were greeted by the hostess who showed us to our reserved table in the Speakeasy for my birthday dinner. As you walk down the stairs the walls are autographed by all of the musicians who have had the honor to perform here. The main room has a dozen or so tables and a partitioned part of the floor where the musicians play. Walking into the second (separated only by a slotted partition) is the bar which has nice baseboard lighting.  The hostess showed us our table which had a nice \"reserved\" plaque. 

On to the drink! One thing that I REALLY loved about this place was its extensive beer list. As a craft beer aficionado I was pleased to see such brews as Great Divide (Yeti Imperial Stout), Blue Point (Sour Cherry Imperial Stout, $10) and local brews like Church Brew Works (Saaz Monster). The menu has beer listed by type for easy reference. In addition to the extensive beer/draft list they also have several cocktails spanning both the Prohibition era (The Old Fashioned) and Modern time (Vanilla Lemon Drop)

I really enjoyed the food at this place. We started off with the \"Suds and Spuds\" appetizer which are homemade beer battered chips ($7) as well as the Pipe Bombs, which are steak and pepper wontons in a Guinness sauce ($9). For the entree, I had the James Street Meatloaf ($16) which came with a corn fritter and AMAZING smashed red potatoes with a creamy corn sauce. My favorite part of the meal....hands down the smashed potatoes. The meatloaf was pretty good but, in my opinion, was nothing to ring home about. It was kind of dry to be honest.  The potatoes were so good. I could literally eat an entire plate. My wife got the Cajun Grilled Shrimp and Grits ($19) and she loved it. The big Tiger shrimp were delicious and the grits were creamy. 

All in all, I would absolutely recommend this place. The food prices are a bit high for a standard dinner out but definitely a place to go if you want a unique experience to hear live music while you eat. Check their website (www.jamesstreetgastropub.com) for the event schedule."}
{"text":"We're a couple who are new to the area, and were wandering around the North Side the other day when we happened upon this place and decided to pop in for lunch.  Little did we know, it was their first day open after a (very classy and thorough, by the looks of it) full refurbishment.  The place has a great vibe that seems to incorporate a lot of its history as a major jazz venue with some modern touches.  Great looking bar.  The service was excellent - we felt welcomed by our server L'Tanya, who knew the menu inside and out, kept our drinks topped up and chatted with us a bit about the history of the place.  The food was solid - nicely classed-up pierogie appetizer, spinach salad with some nice bacon and slivered almonds (try the creamy onion dressing) and a turkey burger that was above average.  Definitely give this place a try - they've got event spaces upstairs and are going to have music downstairs - it's got big ambitions and seems to be living up to them."}
{"text":"Delicious pierogies and great fried Atlantic Cod. Seriously it was buttery and flaky and perfect. The only thing that doesn't give this review five stars is that my husband got the gumbo and it didn't have crawfish or okra. The spices were pretty dead on but if you're going to make gumbo, and we respect the seafood limitations of the region, you need to at least have okra. Also, if you're going to charge $23 for gumbo it really should have crawfish. Other than that the service was great and the onion rings are phenomenal. Beer selection is superb and I didn't need more than one Moscow mule before I was feeling it. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It's a little tight, a little expensive but the rest makes up for it.  The speakeasy in the basement can get a little crowded and it can take a while to get a drink.  The food is pretty decent, and the booths by the bar are our favorite.  If you're there, say hi to Brett.  I hear he's getting hitched in a few months.  Check out the musicians too, if you're looking for some good jazz.  The upstairs is known for the occasional swing dancing event, and they have some really great performers cutting the rug all night long.  Most will even teach you how to do the Charleston, if you ask nicely.  :)"}
{"text":"I really dig James Street Gastropub. It's a great neighborhood bar with good eats and great drinks. I love their fries. So addictive! Jazz downstairs is also awesome. I went once and was super impressed with the band. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Was there on a Friday night for a small concert. I had Mac and cheese with broccoli. I was very disappointed. The broccoli was clearly frozen and just heated up and tossed onto the bed of pasta without any seasonings or cheese. The pasta itself was very basic and not very cheesy. My friend got the pierogis with cheese sauce which were good but you only get three which wasn't really worth it. A friend got the bbq burger and was completely satisfied with it. The restaurant itself is a cute, hip spot and one of the few decent spots in the north side."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere but the beers are overpriced.

The food is standard, delectable pub fare."}
{"text":"Good cold beer and a nice selection of wine make this neighborhood tavern a real treat. Jazz played downstairs on the weekends. The waitstaff and bartenders very friendly and attentive. The patrons very colorful and entertaining. The food was good but not great. I'd be here often if I lived in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My husband was a patient at Allegheny General Hospital, a couple blocks up the street, for over a month. I ate numerous brunches, lunches and dinners here during his difficult stay.  It was always the best part of my day. Not only did I work my way through most of the incredibly delicious menu, the friendly staff made each meal a pleasure. And, being from Mississippi, I appreciated the authentic southern flare of the cuisine. Every meal was fantastic. I was so grateful to have a warm, inviting place to soothe my hunger while I struggled with his illness."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try James Street Gastro Pub on a Sunday at about noon. They had a lunch menu, regular menu, drink menu, special menu, and bands playing downstairs. We each were given waters and I got a fountain of youth martini with Tit's vodka, mint, a splash of bubbly and some flower extract. It was pretty tasty but not sure worth the $12.00. The thing that was a little frustrating for us was that the one lady who actually was working was the bartender, hostess, busser, and server. There were about 14 people in the place. I seen some other people, but no one helped this lady out at all. It took us 25 minutes to order lunch. I got the chicken caser wrap and my girlfriend got the gastro pub salad. They were both tasty, but what we thought would be a quick lunch was anything but that. It was not this lady's fault, but I don't know what would have happened if a few more groups of people would have came in. She would have been in trouble with no help. I would give a better rating if the service was good but it was not. The food was tasty though and my drink was fine. When we got our food I gave her my credit card at the same time because I didn't want to be there any longer than we already were. It was taking about 30 minutes for appetizers to come out for the people around us. Everything was just extremely slow. I would not return on a Sunday for lunch, but my try back when the staff may be a little more ready for people to come in."}
{"text":"I love this place. I had the capresse salad, it was served with warm pita wedges. My husband had the mac & cheese topped with buffalo chicken. Mac & cheese was pretty tasty. I like this place because they have wine from the Pittsburgh winery and it's good stuff. I like the older woman who waits on us, she is very nice. One time we had a younger man waiting on us and he wasn't very attentive. I have yet to have dessert there or venture upstairs to enjoy some music. I have been in the basement to listen to music and have also had sandwiches in the basement. We've been a few times, would like to check out their drag Queen brunch."}
{"text":"A really nice atmosphere, some good food, excellent selection of craft beer, and oh yeah, free parking on the north side? Adds up to a winner! After some initial issues during our last visit (now resolved thanks to the owners Lisa and Adam) we really LIKE this place!!!  It's so nice to see when the owners take a personal interest in assuring everyone that comes in has an enjoyable experience and has a good time. It really does make a difference! Kudos to Lisa and Adam!

The food is excellent! I highly recommend the onion rings - they are among the best I've ever had! The special secret buttermilk-based coating and the thickness of the onions themselves really contribute to a fabulous taste experience! These are NOT your typical frozen out of the bag onion rings! Oh no! These are truly memorable! The burgers are good and mine was cooked exactly as I asked! When was the last time THAT'S happened anywhere? I had the cowboy crunch which was a spicy devil full of flavor and topped with corn chips. While the corn chips added some crunch, the burger was the real star. Yum indeed!! My wife got the twisted chicken and loved it! So much so that I never even got a bite!  That's saying something!

In truth, this is more like a 4 1/2 star rating. You'll like it here. If only they had more craft beer on tap (which I prefer over the bottle selection) I'd bump it up to five. But believe me, you'll find some good food and some good drink here. Isn't that what you're looking for? Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes.

Tried something new with my friends.   The place is a pretty cool older bar.    I was hoping to hear some Jazz.

Orders some apps and dinner.    We order the fried oysters and the pipe bombs.   The fried oysters were pretty good.    The pipe bombs were very greasy (not sliced) as in some of the pictures (they were like egg rolls).

I ordered one of their signature burgers (basically a bacon blue cheese burger).  The burger was over cooked.

The drinks were great.   The bartender did a great job.   I noticed that toward the end of the evening - it seemed to get warmer in the restaurant (uncomfortably hot).

The Jazz portion of the bar (downstairs) was reserved - we could not enjoy the music (I really could not hear it until I went outside :-( )

Overall - I will probably not go back to this place because of my other options."}
{"text":"Let's start with what's right - the bartender/waiter was nice and the establishment seemed to attract an \"ok\" crowd.  Now to what's wrong - the food was terrible, beyond terrible, just really terrible.  I've had MUCH better prepackaged hummus and the falafel was not palatable.  I'm very grateful that this bar was not my introduction to Mediterranean food.  However, here's my disclosure, I'm a foodie, and I probably should stay away from bars when dining out, so I take some responsibility for my disappointment.   However, the next time I want what tastes like previously frozen food from Giant Eagle's freezer, I think I'll just go to Giant Eagle.  When it comes to the food, buyer beware."}
{"text":"We came here with a plan to see Joe Greshecky  after dinner. That didn't happen  (should have gone to another entrance and up the stairs but went downstairs to another band by accident... mediocre at best).... but that's not about the food. We were pleasantly surprised by our meal. I ordered a glass of cabernet and they said they were out and brought me a taste of another that I didn't care fie... suddenly they found a bottle of the one I'd originally ordered. Not sure what was going on there--maybe trying to get rid of a less good wine. Still.. the one I ended up with was good so I'll move onto the food. We shared the \"tots\" topped with onions, meat, and cheese... half expecting it to be gross but it was really tasty and -- compared to expectations-- not nearly as heavy as expected. The real winner was the \"build your own Mac and cheese\" which was delicious Mac and cheese which we to p ed with bavon, tomatoes, and fried Brussels sprouts. Really good. Some hummus and veggies brought the richness down to round it out. Is this the best food ever? Probably not... but a great spin on bar food and a fun menu."}
{"text":"Oh how I wish I could give this place more stars... I wanted to love it.  I really did.  And for some reason, I had it in my head that I was going to (which probably lead me to my disappointment). 

After going a few times, the one theme stays the same... the service and ambiance is not enough.  The food needs to be better for me to be able to want to come back.  Despite a good, friendly and attentive staff, and a great beer and cocktail selection, there just needs to be better food.  Even the basics were just that, basic... nothing to write home about.  

Maybe things will change, and I am sure we will give it another chance, but I do not see myself rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, awesome Cajun fried oysters and spot on negronis.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I liked the name probably the most.  There was nothing that stuck out in my mind as 'bad'.  There was nothing that stuck out in my mind as 'great'.  It was good.  

The waitress was a bit new but she was fine.  
The food was fine.  
The seating was...was fine.  

I surprised that the interior looked a bit more dated/shabby than I thought it could for a place that opened four years ago.  

Good place to stop and grab an app and a beer before a game or something; a stop along the way, but not a destination.

That said...I didn't stay for the band.  Staying for the band might have made more of a positive impression.  If live music is your jam, then maybe decent food is all you really need because you're in it for the ear candy.  

Not a place I'm likely to return to, but only because there's so much competition and so many places to try and I'm not in the Northside much unless I'm heading to a game."}
{"text":"If you want a real speakeasy, go to Speakeasy in the Omni. I have never been so shocked by bad service than I was at this place.

My boyfriend and I were looking for a night of live music and good cocktails, with maybe a little room for a slow dance or two? Something old fashioned and classy. We were so excited to go to JSGP, got all dolled up and even took an Uber there so we could really just relax.
I had called earlier that day to make a reservation in the speakeasy part of the building and the host told me it was going to be very hard to fit us in. Once we arrived, we were greeted at the door by very casual looking hostesses and saw that we were in what looked like a pretty casual restaurant. The hostesses were friendly, and directed us to a woman in sweatpants sitting on a chair by the stairs. She barked at us for a cover charge, which we were not informed we would need. My boyfriend ask if we could put it on our bill as we didn't bring cash. She said she thought so but she didn't know, and let us downstairs anyway.

Once we were downstairs we found ourselves to be one of only two tables, with plenty of empty tables available (not exactly what the host had told us). The band was using the majority of the space in front of our table to set up. The server came over to us and asked for our drink order. He was wearing suspenders and the only moderately acceptable part of our evening. We asked if this was the space where we would be able to have a slow dance to live music. He said he didn't know. A lot of people seemed to not know what was going on in this place. We put our order in for drinks and were handed plastic menus. Not what I was expecting for a 'speakeasy'. We saw how high the prices were for the atmosphere, quality of menu and service and were pretty shocked. The server came back and told us we were supposed to go to the OTHER room for the live music and dancing. To go outside and around the corner to a different door. Okay then.

We do as he says and go up a staircase that looks like it's going to the kitchen... I think, \"alright, so this is more speakeasy-ish.\" We get to the top of the stairs and there's a kid who looks like he's still in high school next to the door. He asks us for a second cover charge. Again, we ask to put it on our bill. Keep in mind, we never even received our drinks downstairs.

We go into the 'ballroom' of sorts... the best way I can describe it is that it resembled a high school cafeteria prom. There was one other couple in the huge room with us wearing football jerseys, and chairs stacked against the wall.

A very, very stressed out server approaches us and informs us that he is the only server working tonight, so it's going to take longer than usual, and if we need him we need to flag him down. I couldn't believe it. I worked in the service industry for years and that is just not acceptable to say the moment someone sits down at a table they had to pay a cover charge for when we were one of two tables that were seated.

The server went back to get menus and I told my boyfriend I didn't want him wasting a cent on the place. As we told him we were leaving he got a bit defensive and rolled his eyes.
We ended up getting a SECOND Uber back to the southside, changing into jeans, and going to Fatheads. Thank God.

This place is not marketing itself correctly at all. I will never go back and never recommend it."}
{"text":"One word: disappointing. But it wouldn't be disappointing if they didn't try to bill it as a \"gastropub\"! Seriously, how is this a gastropub AT ALL? There's little to no creativity shown on the menu. Meat & Potatoes = gastropub. James Street = bar with decent barfood. Not the same thing.

Sandwiches are average to good. Mac and Cheese has been inconsistent (it was great one time, but another time really bad?). Peanut butter wings...weird, not in a good way. But there's really nothing on the menu that sounds all that interesting, except the donut cheeseburger which, i'll admit, sounds pretty tempting but I haven't been in the right mood to try it just yet...

The atmosphere on the other hand is really cozy and comfortable, and the drinks are really good! It's a great drinking spot! But a gastropub? I think not. Honestly, it reminded me of Harris Grill in that I love it as a bar but hate it for food.

5-stars as a Speakeasy, 2-stars as a Gastropub. Especially with such an amazing food scene happening in Pittsburgh right now, all I have to say to James Street is...try harder.

Update: The house salad with bacon, pickled onions, & a peach vinaigrette was bangin'. But it still doesn't equate to gastropub status. Sorry, guys."}
{"text":"I was recommended to go here and oddly enough I was also told this place wasn't that special. I ended up here by luck after my mother who is very impatient when she is hungry wouldn't wait 5 minutes for a table at another restaurant and oh my goodness I'm glad she is impatient. I ordered the cowboy crunch burger and it was awesome. I typically don't finish anything and I finished this burger.  It came with the homemade potato chips and they were perfect and thin and just the right amount of salt. I'll be happy to have this in the options going forward when the \"I don't know where do you want to eat\" starts.
The ambiance was not what I expected and it could be so much cooler, but the food was excellent."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever been treated this poorly as a customer before. It may have just been an off night here (because the reviews seemed pretty good), but as a group that was in Pittsburg for one night only and this was our dinner spot -- disappointed is an understatement. 

From the beginning, the host took too long to seat us and we were at our table for quite awhile before a server came to help us. The entire time, we felt like she had something better to do. Unfriendly, curt, and rarely around. It took us far too long to get our drinks. We did enjoy our drinks and food for the most part. This was going to be a 3-Star review, until it came time to pay. 

It took our server 20 minutes to take our cards to pay. When she returned, she said \"Our credit card machine isn't working soo you can go to the atm over there to get cash or..\" When we told her we did not want to pay an ATM fee for something that is out of our control, she disappeared for several minutes again. We asked for a manager. The manager eventually came to us (about 10 minutes later) and was just as rude. She was speaking very frantically and unprofessionally. It felt like she was yelling at us and it made us feel like the whole situation was our fault. \"Our internet sucks, I can't swipe these cards. I am very, very sorry. There is an ATM over there. You can get cash or you can just walk out.\" We told her we understood technology problems happen, but that our server was disappointing all night so this wasn't the only issue. She then THREW our credit cards, told us to leave, and left the table. We definitely wished we had picked a different location to have our only dinner in Pittsburg."}
{"text":"The food was good I had the twisted chicken sandwich. I've had sandwiches that were juicer and bigger for the same amount of money but I would eat it again. I substituted a side salad instead of the regular side which I was charged an up charge of $4. But I don't think the price is worth the amount of food received"}
{"text":"Good steaks. Small Neighborhood feel 
Good thing to visit if you are going after to listen to jazz 
I would come back anytime"}
{"text":"Best Buttermilk Fried Chicken ever!  I'd return just for that!  The live music was great as were the cocktails."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for date night or a double date to go downstairs foursome jazz. Friendly bar staff on main level with good bar food dishes"}
{"text":"I really, really like James Street. It's close to my house, and inviting, and they have fantastic food and a great beer selection. They have one of the best turkey burgers you can get - I even prefer it to their regular burgers. However, I can't get past two things: the price of the appetizers and the chips that come with everything. 

I'd love to be able to take coworkers to James Street for a drink after work, or catch up with friends on the weekends without committing to dinner, but I just can't. The appetizers have both small portions and high prices. Even something as simple as potato chips with a few tablespoons of dip is wildly overpriced.

That brings me to the second thing - the chips. They leave every meal feeling more like lunch, regardless of what time of day it is. I get it, they're cheaper to make than fries - but they also feel way cheaper. I hardly ever eat more than one or two of them. And for the prices you pay for food at James Street, being served chips feels like a disppointment every time.

I wish I could rank it up there with the best, but these two factors really drop it down a notch. However, it's still worthy of a visit - it's a gorgeous space with great programming and aaaaamazing creme brulee. Just skip the apps and be ready for a bland, boring side."}
{"text":"Came here with friends to treat a night out.  We'd had our reception her years ago and it's only improved.  We went downstairs to the Speakeasy.  

Mallory was good, if a bit timid-mannered for a waitress at a jazz joint.  Had shrimp and cheese grits with broccoli and a side of chili.  Food was excellent.  The chili came first and it was well spiced, hearty and tasty.  Next was the main course.  The colossal shrimp were seared perfectly and the deep green broccoli was full, fresh and tender.  The main attraction was those velvety grits!

An overall good time had by all and the band was good too!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  And a total hidden gem in this city.  I highly recommend.  Went here on Saturday when they had live jazz music and it was really crowded so there was no where to sit, but the music was great.  Drinks were tasty and had the turkey burger which was great.  

Love the atmosphere and feel of this place - I'm definitely going to check this place out again and hopefully get there a little earlier so I can get a seat!"}
{"text":"I had some monster hamburger here which was very good.  The pierogies were awesome too.  Everyone at the table seemed to have a good meal.  I was also pleased with the beer selection, which is pretty much a must if you are going to call yourself a Gastropub.  I feel like if I lived near by I'd be at this place frequently."}
{"text":"I'm starting to drool just writing a review for this place. They have a great space and a pretty huge beer selection. I've had a few of their burgers - all were excellent. I've never been that much of a pierogie fan but the ones they serve here are insanely incredibly good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to James Street before a Pirates games back in April. We were surprised how run down the neighbourhood seemed to be considering it's right next to a good sized park and so close to PNC, Heinz Field and the downtown. Hopefully it's on the upswing as it certainly deserves it.

Inside the bar, it's quite welcoming with lots of dark woods, arches and stained glass. They're definitely going for the speakeasy vibe with some jazz themed paintings and pictures of musicians. We settled into one of the small booths raised slightly up from the main bar area as a few more people trickled in after work/before the game. Lovely cabinets and shelves displayed their libations and glassware behind the bar.

There were some tempting apps and entrees, but in the end I ended up going with the James Street Meatloaf which comes with smashed potatoes, a corn fritter and sweet creamed corn sauce. My girlfriend couldn't resist her go-to sandwich, the pulled pork, and got their Yelp-famous onion rings on the side.

There was a bit of a wait considering there weren't many people here, but it gave me some time to sift through their impressively large and neatly categorized beer menu. Since I was in a blasphemous mood, I went with a bottle of Lucifer. A Belgian wheat, it wasn't as heavy as many are and was quite effervescent as well. Devilishly good.

Luckily the food was mostly worth the wait. My meatloaf was actually a small loaf cut on the diagonal and appeared to have been broiled or finished in a pan as it had a nice crust on all sides that added more flavour to it. It had a great, traditional meatloaf flavour and despite being relatively thin and broiled, it was very juicy. The smashed potatoes were good, and made for excellent delivery vessels for the cream corn sauce which complemented everything nicely. The corn fritters were crisp on the outside and slightly doughy on the inside, but the chewy bits of corn inside threw off the texture for me.

My lovely date really enjoyed her pulled pork sandwich, although I found the meat to be on the mushy side and lacking any discernible texture, although it still had a good, well balanced flavour. The onion rings were super crispy, but they could have used more seasoning in the batter and were getting to be on the cold side of the spectrum when they arrived. 

Service from our waiter, Shawn, was spot on and friendly and he eagerly answered our questions or went to find the info if he didn't know it.

James Street has a great atmosphere and solid food which while not perfect, made for a solid pre-game meal."}
{"text":"Overall, the two times we've been here have been very good experiences.  The wings are absolutely top notch - try the chipotle bbq or teriyaki - delicious and different!  The drinks are unique and delicious - pricey but worth it.  The entrees & sandwiches that we've had have left something to be desired - my chicken sandwich (the bacon chicken, forget what it was called) was a small portion - didn't fill out the pretzel bun - and was dry.  My wife had the risotto and was not pleased either.  And our server we had last night (Sat 12/26/15) was terrible - forgot several things at each course of the meal, would disappear for lengths of time, and was generally slow and seemed not to know what she was doing.  Our server the first time we were here (about 6 months ago) was excellent, though.  

The atmosphere is amazing - absolutely gorgeous wood work and dark wood bar.  

Conclusion - a great place for drinks & an appetizer before going somewhere else for your main course.  Or a good option at the end of the evening for a night cap."}
{"text":"Stopped in following a game, around 10:15, and, based on the pub's own website AND the Yelp hours (until 12:00AM), found that the kitchen closed at 10.  

After enquiring about the hours, a somewhat brusque barkeep repeated \"the kitchen closed at 10\".

I doubt I will retest their website information again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been quasi regulars at the Gastropub for a couple of years. The food is great, the staff friendly, and the music is awesome. My only complaint is that the kitchen seems to get backed up regularly making the service painfully slow at times."}
{"text":"I'm a bit confused by what happened here.  We were sitting around having drinks, then the next thing I know, I'm convincing my wife to order a burger on a doughnut bun with candied bacon.  This was awesome...for a little bit.  With the benefit of hindsight, I would never even pretend like this is a good idea.  There's a reason why we separate the dinner and dessert courses traditionally.

That being said, the atmosphere was awesome, beer selection good, and apparently Tom Cruise was there not too long ago.  I saw pictures.  He was smiling.  If that's not a ringing endorsement then I just don't know what's right anymore.  Dude is like a level 4 alien master, who beat Val Kilmer in volleyball at least once.

If you're in the North Side, this is definitely a place worth your time.  The menu is pretty eclectic, and though I wouldn't recommend the doughnut burger, I think everything else is pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Living in the neighborhood, I've started stopping for take out and occasionally eating there. The food is fantastic! Fan of the Cobb and a side of wings! Makes for an outstanding meal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here twice, each time getting drinks and sharing food.  They have a great beer list, offer many classic and specialty cocktails, and have a very reasonably (read: nothing fancy) priced wine list.  Each time, we both ended up ordering a beer--they always have something new and interesting to try.  

There is not much that's veggie-friendly on their menu, even the collard greens and all but one salad have bacon in them!  The non-bacon salad is Caesar, which DOES have anchovy paste.  Mac-and-cheese is \"meh.\"  I wouldn't come here for the food alone, but the H, who is a meat eater, says their burgers are good, as well as the fish and chips.  Just a heads-up to the veggies out there that the options are pretty sparse.

I give this place four stars for the service--it's always friendly and right-on.  The atmosphere is also really cool--both times I have been, there has been a live jazz group downstairs, but they also show it upstairs on a big TV so everyone can watch/listen.

The menus are in old jazz album covers, bonus points for that!  If you're on the north side, you should give James Street a try."}
{"text":"I will first start off this review by saying if you haven't been here before, you need to visit this place!  My girlfriend and I headed here before the Pirates game this past Tuesday after I found some high ratings for it here on Yelp.  The outside of the restaurant makes it look like the inside of the establishment would be your average neighborhood bar.  That couldn't be further from the truth though as the inside modern chic and they have a really awesome speakeasy downstairs.  There was also upbeat jazz music in the background the whole time we were there and they have live music on the weekends.
 
My girlfriend and I decided to start off our meal with the veggie fries that came with a trio of dipping sauces.  We weren't really sure what to expect from them but whenever they came we saw that we had chosen wisely.  In addition to your normal zucchini fries, there was also portobello and green and red bell pepper fries.  The breading was perfect as it helped to enhance the flavor of the vegetable but was thin enough to let you taste the vegetable as well.  All three dipping sauces (a tomato relish, white cheddar something? and a bacon ranch) were also good with the bacon ranch being my favorite.  For my entree I ordered the Buttermilk Chicken which was a fried buttermilk battered chicken breast with white cheddar grits and collard greens.  The first thing that I noticed whenever my dish came was how large the chicken breast was and that it had a great golden brown color to it.  I was actually impressed with how moist the chicken inside it was but was slightly disappointed in the lack of seasoning in the batter.  This was easily remedied though as I asked for some hot sauce and while waiting for it to come tried some of my grits on top of it.  Both did the trick and I ended up thoroughly enjoying alternating between the two.  The grits by themselves were awesome as they were easily some of the cheesiest grits that I have ever had before.  Finally the collard greens were cooked nicely and had no bitterness to them at all.  When all was said and done it was easily one of the best meals that I have had in the burgh lately.  The server that we had, Jarrett, was also awesome and one of the best that I have had recently.  He was polite and engaging while easily answering all of the questions that we had for him which really helped to enhance our experience here.
 
The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here in the future.  I am actually excited to head back here for not only the food, but to have cocktails on a weekend night and listen to some jazz music.  This is definitely a hidden gem on the North Side!"}
{"text":"The service at this place is disgraceful. We walked jnto an empty restaurant but the bar was packed. We were promptly seated but told that the restaurant was fully booked and that we couldn't stay more than two hours. 

We then waited almost 10 minutes for our waitress to arrive, thankfully she bright water with her. We were already to order. After all there was a time limit! 

I ordered the twisted chicken sandwich with a side of fries. My husband ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with blue cheese, fries and a slice of onion. I also reauested a side of ranch. After all, Pittsburgh.

The food runner brought us our food. Sadly no ranch on my plate. She fetched us some but in the mean time we realized that my mister didn't get his request blue cheese, he ended up with ranch. 

Our waitress swept by, didn't ask us how things were, just took my iced tea and refilled it. Then dropped it off with out a word and vanished.

A few minutes later my husband realized his sandwich had no onion. I also realized that my sandwich was missing an ingredient. The sweet red onions. :-(

No sign of a waitress so we just ate our sandwiches as is.

As we ate a couple sat down at the booth next to ours. The hostess rushed over to tell them that booth was already reserved. Again, still empty restaurant. She told them they could stay there but they had to be gone by 7:30. It was only 5:40...

The food was mediocre and wayyy over priced. The menu on their website is outdated, the prices are more than what website says.

I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"I give this place a 4.5 because I need to try more food before upgrading to the fill five stars.  The beer selection is solid and reasonably priced; we found a rare beer there! You can listen to live jazz/blues music while eating your meal for free?!  The sweet meat burger is a must try.  Donuts used as the bun and candied bacon!  You must make the trip to visit this place.  Oh and the staff was super friendly too!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a bite to eat and a good drink. The food is more unique than a typical bar. They have a ton of beers that change regularly, so if you like beer, go thirsty! The ambiance is cool and the bar always has some interesting conversations going on. Overall, a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here for lunch, but left very disappointed. 

We walked in and there was no hostess to be seen anywhere. We stood at the hostess station for a good long while before the bartender literally yelled at us to sit wherever we like. There was literally one person at the bar, and one table seated. The dining room we were in looked strangely like a wedding: cane back chairs, red tablecloths. We sat at the table for another long while, before my coworker got up and grabbed menus for us. My jaw literally dropped at the prices. Finally the waitress came over, obviously annoyed that we got menus for ourselves, and gave us the lunch menus, acting as though we would have missed some huge bargain had we ordered from the main menu. So I think, \"Thank God, there are lunch specials. Maybe this will all be fine.\" 

So we all look over the lunch menu, and notice that it has pretty much nothing with any meat. I believe one sandwich with bacon, and a sandwich of the day. It's marginally cheaper than the regular menu, because it is cheaper dishes! Like, basically the cheapest dishes a place could offer, and still all overpriced. And the one thing that might have been appealing, a half sandwich and soup item, you could only get the \"sandwich of the day.\" 

I ended up ordering the jerk chicken sandwich off the regular menu. I believe it was one of the cheapest sandwiches on the menu. For $14. For a grilled chicken sandwich. For lunch. I mean, it seemed like a better deal than a $10 grilled cheese...

The food took a long time. Of course. Once it came, it was good. Not great, but good. Smallish chicken breast, but I liked the toppings on the sandwich. It had a nice flavor but was exceedingly sloppy. The fries were really very good. Perfect, maybe. And plentiful. My coworker's salad looked good, but it was even more pricy than my sandwich and had even less chicken. 

All in all, if you have plenty of money to spend, and over an hour and a half for lunch, you can get some good food. But for me, it wasn't worth the price, mediocre service, and long wait."}
{"text":"I really, really, wanted to like James Street Gastropub.

I went with a large group for dinner before a 10PM show.  We had about 2 hours for dinner, which I thought would be plenty of time.  Our waitress was nice enough to inform us that the kitchen was small, it was busy, and that service would be a little slow.  We barely made it out of there in time!

My cocktail was good, and the fried vegetable appetizer was good.  I wish our waitress would have let us know what the sauces were, as one definitely had bacon in it (which I found out after eating it, oops).  But, I didn't blame her for that.  My issue came when my meal came.  I had ordered the veggie sandwich with a side of collard greens.  Nowhere on the menu did it say that the collard greens were cooked in bacon.  It did say \"classic collard greens\",  which I guess means loaded with bacon.  I just wish our waitress was a bit more attentive and I could have switched up my order.

Other than that, the food was decent.  I was prepared for slower service with a large group, but I was disappointed in the time it took for our meals to come out and the time it took for our drinks to come out (and subsequent drink rounds)."}
{"text":"I like this place, don't get me wrong. But everything is SO expensive. I realize that they want to keep the undesirables out (local street people), but WOW, way to make it obvious! I mean why am I paying $5 to see a mediocre band and THEN paying the prices for drinks that they charge? 

This is Pittsburgh, guys, not Washington DC. Maybe bring it back down to our level and you can count me in as a happy customer."}
{"text":"My experience with James Street is limited so bear with me. 

A group of us stumbled upon JS after getting to Park House and seeing that it was not open yet. We weren't sure what expect, but were pleasantly surprised with the staff and knowledge of beer. I can't remember the bartenders' name, but she def knew her stuff and was fun to talk to. The owner went out of her way to make sure we were happy and taken care of, even though she spent a good deal of time promoting the bar even though we were from out of town.

The beer selection is pretty good. I did not try any of the food so I can't really comment on that. If / when I come back to Pittsburgh, I'll def visit James Street."}
{"text":"Last night, I found myself at the James Street Gastropub, and I was blown away. What a cool place tucked away in North Side!
First off, the interior is very cool. Lots of wood and really neat architecture. The upstairs is very class with a large bar and lots of booths and tables. Downstairs, in the Speakeasy, there's a very cool bar that mixes modern architecture with Prohibition accents. There's also a very nice stage with lots of tables and booths. While no one was performing when I was there, I was surprised by how clean and well lit the area was. Also, the staff is topnotch in their crisp black uniforms.
Make sure you check out their beer and alcohol selection. Tons of local craft beers, and there were spirits there that I've never heard of. 
As for the food, the menu is filled with classic Americana and modern dishes. I had the meatloaf entree, which included two slabs of dense and tasty meatloaf, red skin mashed potatoes, a cheesy grits gravy, and corn fritters. At $16, it seemed pricey on the menu, but it is well worth the cost. There are lots of items to choose from including crazy appetizers, sandwiches, burgers (I want to try the sweet meats burger next).
Next time you're in North Side, stop by and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Just hit this place up after reading some of the reviews on here.  Great place if you want a local hangout with decent music and food.  I had the \"Sweet Meat\", aka, the burger that has a donut for a bun and candied bacon.  The meat was prepared perfectly and had great flavor.  The bun and bacon just put it over the top (in a great way).  The music playing this evening was Jazz and was pretty good for a local spot.  The bartender was great to talk to and definitely loved the place.  Lots of micro-brews and an expanding Scotch/Whiskey selection as well."}
{"text":"Best cob salad! Great beer selection. Meatloaf amazing."}
{"text":"Having lived just off of James street for a few years when I first moved to Pittsburgh, I've seen a few businesses come and go at this location. Unfortunately,  while I hope I'm wrong, I'll be really surprised if this iteration of the James Street Tavern sticks around much longer than its predecessors.

We've been there a two times and neither time left us thrilled. The first time was for lunch. I got a simple buffalo chicken sandwich that was so-so. The chicken was dry and a little chewy, which made the meal feel too much like your average bar food. That would be fine, but when you walk into a really cool, old building like this, it's fair to say that your initial hopes are higher than \"typical bar food\"...even for lunch. Perhaps our outlook was tainted by our lofty expectations, so we decided to go again...for dinner.

Dinner started out well enough. We were met by a very nice waiter. Unfortunately, he was almost too pushy when it came to the menu. We asked for advice, but there wasn't a lot of genuine feedback from him. His advice was way too \"I like everything on the menu\" for me. Let's be real...no one likes everything on the menu. Regardless, I opted for the oyster po boy. Granted, this was after seeing one of the kitchen workers leave the bathroom without washing his hands. I wanted to leave, but we had already ordered drinks and I figured I'd test my immune system and stay. Unsurprisingly, it left me uncomfortable the entire meal. Anyway, the po boy was simply more po boy than oyster. There really wasn't a whole lot of fried oysters on the sandwich, which more-or-less left me with a lot of toppings on a bun. The flavor was okay, but nothing special. I got a side of fries, which were good, though. Hard to go wrong with triple fried fries! 

My wife ordered the buttermilk chicken dinner. The chicken was good, but she wasn't a fan of the sides. I can't hold that against them, though, as grits aren't my favorite thing, regardless of how they're prepared.

The pros? Nice atmosphere in the dining area (I haven't been downstairs during the Speakeasy's current run), a great beer list (some on tap, many in bottles), and nice servers. Also, the suds & spuds are really good. Subtle beer flavor in the chips made them interesting without tasting too much like beer.

Cons? The food is simply average. 

I'm willing to try it again, but I'm just not convinced that the third time will be a charm."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite hang out place in the 'burgh. Having just started a job over here in the North Side, it is the perfect place for me to have a bite before hitting rush hour traffic.

Formerly Serendipity, James Street has only been here since mid December. The vibe here is cool, laid back and mellow. I had the pleasure to hear an ENTIRE Booker T album (!!!) as I dined this evening. The beer menu is phenom, an they have Rogue samplers on certain nights! 

The waiter remembered me and knew exactly what I had ordered to drink for the time before, and this is only my 3rd visit- gotta love that! The Turkey Burger was juicy, perfectly seasoned and melted in my mouth....this paired with homemade chips was AHHH-mazing. I loved that damn burger so much that I have eaten it all 3 times I have been here.

Do yourself a favor and check this place out. The service is beyond cool and friendly. They have live jazz on Fri nights as well."}
{"text":"So I'm naive to the Northside. It's one of the few neighborhoods in Pittsburgh that I am relatively unfamiliar with. Other than the north shore area around the stadiums, I'm pretty clueless.

So when I stopped by James Street I was pleasantly surprised. It's an old fashioned looking bar with the original woodworking and everything. Upstairs has a bar and restaurant seating area. There is a a nostalgic feeling up there, like stepping back in time.

Downstairs is great. At first I didn't even realize there was a downstairs bar, that is until I heard music floating up and people with drinks heading down. So I followed them down and saw a bluegrass band playing on stage and enjoyed some drinks at the dark bar. It's a cool little subterranean setup. A stage with tables filled with people watching live music on one side and a bar with booths along the wall on the other. 

Also, if you are a beer lover James Street has a nice selection of drafts for a reasonable prices. Craft beers were between 4 and 5 dollars. 

This is the kind of place that opened my eyes to the North Side and I am going to have to check out some of the other places in the area."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  Ever changing.  Rivals most of the spots in Pittsburgh for great selection of craft beers.  Hamburger selection is diverse, unique twist on dinner menu and a good sandwich and salad options.  A generous wine selection that will not break the bank and cocktail creations for everyone.  I say yes and give it a shot."}
{"text":"After a pirates game on a saturday, we were looking for something to eat (plus a couple drinks) that was not too far from home. My friend had eaten here the other day and said it was very,very good so I suggested going and I'm so glad we did! This was such a neat atmosphere-very old-timey yet sophisticated and we could hear lots of great jazz music coming from inside (which later we discovered was live downstairs in the speakeasy). Their cocktail list featured a lot of prohibition style drinks-I ordered a whiskey sour and my boyfriend ordered a vesper martini. The drinks were hand-crafted nicely and very tasty, enough so that we each had 2. For food, many items looked tasty but I settled on the pulled pork sandwich (the honey-chipotle BBQ sauce was exactly what i was craving at that moment so i was sold immediately). The coleslaw was on the side and it lacked flavor but I used a little on top of my sandwich and the BBQ sauce meshed with the coleslaw nicely. House chips came on the side. They wer eok, nothing to talk about. My boyfriend ordered 12 wings, 6 tequilla lime and 6 chipotle BBQ. I tried a tequilla lime and was not impressed but then again that is not a flavor I would have ordered myself. When we were leaving we popped quickly downstairs to check out the speakeasy and I cannot wait to go back to hear music there! It's a really neat environment to see jazz in and my boyfriend being a band director who plays the trumpet as well is very into jazz (obviously) and was already talking about coming back before we even left. Overall, this is a really cool spot (it is a little pricey but not over the top-basically on par with the trendier restaurants in Pittsburgh) and I'd like to sample more of the food to get a better idea of the overall food quality but I'm so thrilled we have now found a new place to see great live jazz if nothing else!"}
{"text":"I just walked in, I sat down at the bar. I looked at one bartender, I looked at two bartenders, I looked at three bartenders, and absolutely no one helped me in 15 minutes. I'll not be back."}
{"text":"Plenty of tasty food, even for vegetarians. Being from Tennessee, I was so happy to see a good variety of southern staples, with a Pittsburgh twist, on the menu!"}
{"text":"I'd probably give this 3.5 stars but since I have to choose, I'm going to go with a 3.  Since I'm from New Orleans, I was excited to try this place since I saw they had some Cajun inspired options.  I really liked the speakeasy ambiance that was cozy with some interesting decor, and all the servers and staff were very friendly and on top of things.  They had a fantastic beer selection as well as a great list of cocktails.  I opted for a cocktail given the speakeasy theme, and it was good (I had the Basil Bourbon) though not amazing.  We had wings and fried oysters for appetizers.  The wings were on special for half off so that was nice and they were quite good.  The fried oysters were also very good and reasonably priced (7 decent sized oysters for $12).  The batter and crispiness were just right.  It came with a giant bowl of some horseradish dip though that was rather overpowering.  Coming from New Orleans, I usually eat oysters with some fresh lemon juice and cocktail sauce or tarter sauce but none of these things were available.  I ordered a burger with a side of mac n cheese for my entree.  I forgot to specify how I wanted it cooked and the waiter didn't ask and it came out medium well which was a bit more done than I would've liked.  I asked for the sharp cheddar but should've picked one of the other cheeses because it tasted like they used some processed cheese, something like those kraft singles so that was not so great, and the lettuce was rather wilty.  The mac-n-cheese came out so hot that even after I waited to finish my entire burger so it would cool off it was still burning me to try to eat it.  It was still smoking as I packed it up to take home an hour later.  I don't now what they did to it but that was crazy.  I did manage to taste some of it and it was just ok.  It really needed some more flavor or something and it was a little on the greasier side.  My friend had a shrimp poboy that looked decent, although they didn't use the proper French bread (though to be fair, no one uses French bread in Pittsburgh it seems, but being from New Orleans I'm picky), the lettuce was also a bit wilty and her shrimp looked a little overdone but she was happy with it.  The onion rings she got with it were fantastic, thick cut and perfectly cooked with a nice crispy better.  I would've liked to see a few more Cajun inspired options, and I'm not sure their creations were unique enough to be called a \"gastropub\" but everything was decent.  They didn't have the music while I was there but seems like a nice place for jazz."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for lunch with coworkers. The food was decent, but the service was horrible. We waited close to 45 minutes for our food to come out both times, and no apology was given. I don't think I'll come back because it's a waste of my lunch break."}
{"text":"I made my first trip to James Street Gastropub & Speakeasy this past weekend. Boy, I have been missing out!  I am a huge fan.  We were seated immediately by a super friendly hostess and our waitress was promptly there for drinks. I loved the atmosphere, the crowd was very eclectic. The dining room is separated from the bar area.  You can definitely bring a large crowd and sit in the dining room.  The bar had TVs, so we were able to catch some of the Pens game. :)
  They have a nice craft beer selection, and what appeared to be some super yummy cocktails.  My BF and I both chose beers.  For appetizers the server recommended, her fave, the Cajun oysters! YUM!  They were cooked perfectly and the seasoning was banging!
For our entrees I chose the Crab Cake sandwich and my BF went with the Sweet Meat burger....let me tell you about that. Holy Cow. It is a burger with a homemade donut bun. It looked intense, but my BF swears that it was delicious and the perfect blend of sweet and salty.  My crab cake was really yummy!  Plenty of lump crab and not a lot of filler. We both chose the homemade onion rings. Good choice.  I LOVE when restaurants make onion rings from scratch, and these did NOT disappoint.
I will definitely be back. We didn't get to hear any live music, but the food and service were excellent! I recommend this spot to anyone who's looking for a nice evening out!"}
{"text":"I once loved this place, but due to recent menu and pricing adjustments, my love is starting to diminish. Prices have increased but the quality/amount of food has not; so paying more cannot be justified.

The service this and any other visit was excellent. Staff are always friendly and attentive.

I will say though, I had the James Street Cobb Salad today and it was probably one of the best salads I've ever had! (This is why I'm conflicted on the amount of stars for the review)"}
{"text":"For my Twenty-Ten Birthday celebration I was in search of a place that combined my favorite things... Beer, Tasty Food, and Music.  What I found was James Street Gastropub & Speakeasy, or as I call it \"My Favorite Pittsburgh Discovery.\"

I've been to James St. many times, but haven't written a review because I have never been able to express how much I love this place.  From the old jazz albums used as menu covers to the HUGE beer selection... This is my happy place.  

On my first visit I selected the Meatloaf, smashed redskins, warm corn fritter, sweet creamed corn sauce.  I never tasted a meatloaf so good.  Incredibly filling but SO good.  Better than Mom's.

Since then I've tried the Singin the Bleu's Burger, Twisted Chicken, Oyster Po Boy, and several other items.  I've never left dissatisfied or hungry.  

Also they have an excellent cocktails list!  For my party, a friend bought the PB&J Martini for me.  I didn't know what to expect but it was surprisingly tasty!

If you're a live music fan, check out the Speakeasy.  It has live bands all the time to go with your food and drink.  I love just sipping my beer and listening to local jazz.  

James Street combines everything I love and I look forward to going back every chance I get."}
{"text":"I feel bad about doing this, but that is what Yelp is all about; Real, up-to-date reviews.  I've visited the James Street twice since my first review and have been underwhelmed each time.  Tonight was not a great experience.  It was \"meh\" at best.

Either I didn't see the full menu on my first visit, or they've changed it up.  While all seemed fine on the surface, I wasn't thrilled about receiving a tiny meatloaf that cost $16 on top of a whole plate of what amounted to garbage potatoes and corn sauce accompanied by two tiny corn fritters.  The meatloaf was tasty, but that price is ridiculous for what you get!  Meatloaf is not expensive and it's easy to make.  If you're going to charge $16 for it, it had better be 1. in a posh establishment with a menu not consisting mainly of sandwiches and bar food, 2. a larger portion that I can take home for another meal (which is what I was expecting), or 3. the most amazing meatloaf I've ever put in my mouth.  In this case the corn fritters were my favorite part of the meal.  This would've been a 3-star review except that...

My friend ordered the buttermilk chicken.  It was a tasty breast (I tried it).  But, the same problem persisted... teeny tiny portions.  You cannot charge $17 for a tiny chicken breast and grits!  Everyone knows how much a chicken breast costs, and grits are the cheapest food on the planet.  Also, as we were driving home, we realized that the corn bread had been left off the plate.

Look, here's the general problem:  The James Street is in a slowly gentrifying area. It's pretty run down, but getting better.  That attracts hipster-types.  Which is cool.  But, your clientele is still a Pittsburgh clientele.  In my last review, I compared the James Street to something you'd find in Philadelphia or NYC.  And, that's true as far as the vibe, the hipsters, and live music goes.  But, we're not in those places.  Everything costs more in Philly and New York. Food costs more in the markets than it does in Pittsburgh, and people also generally take home bigger paychecks and thus can spend more on food.  It offends my Pittsburgh sensibilities that a restaurant like this charges these kinds of prices for, let's face it, typical bar food.  Tasty, but your bottom line is inexpensive.  It feels like a major rip off.

When you switch over to 100% local and sustainable food and alert us all that we're eating organic, then you can up the price and I'll be happy to pay for healthier food.   Same goes when this establishment ceases to be in part a loud sports bar and converts into a romantic restaurant that serves elevated fare.  If the price is upped b/c of the live music, maybe you should considering having a separate menu for the speakeasy (since I have yet to hear live music).  But, until then, I'll head over to any other area restaurant that serves meatloaf and or fried chicken for at least $3 less for a larger portion, and be happier with my purchase."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was excellent. I haven't really ever ventured into the Northside but I'm glad that we did. Speakeasy downstairs, bar and restaurant upstairs with great service. At first we only got drinks but drinks make you hungry so of course we were going to order food. (The old jazz album menus were an awesome touch!) There were enough vegetarian options and they were actually really good! I love that it was spacious, friendly people working there and lots of street parking. We will def be back."}
{"text":"I've. been here twice in the last month and it is just exquisite the food is great the drinks are well maid and the beer menu is extensive although the beers on the menu are not always available. I love the use of old jazz album covers as menus covers and of course the music is great. I can remember the way the old James street was and the food is a lot better the atmosphere has always been incredible you have to love the wall to wall wood and the bar is astounding. the worst part about the place is the neighborhood can be a little rough but it is slowly changing along with the rest of the city. if you like jazz music you will not find better in the city"}
{"text":"It hasn't changed a bit since I was there over 20 years ago!  And that's a good thing, folks.  James Street G&S has a feel of history, of time...almost as if the spirits of the music, the musicians and the clientele have permeated the walls and the wood and to linger.  There are stories to be heard if only those walls could talk!

The long bar upstairs and those gorgeous wooden booths are a wide open, yet intimate, space to gather and talk, to drink and catch up with friends and the latest televised game of your choice.  If you want to talk, upstairs is the place to be, downstairs is where the music is...talking is unnecessary.

Downstairs is where my heart is.  Dark, close, no, not smoky, but that's the only thing that's missing from all those years ago.  Those same beautiful wooden booths line parts of the downstairs by the arches that divide the bar side from the stage side.  There are tables, too, on the stage side to allow a clear view of the musicians who belt out or croon or sweetly sing.  Along with the seating, jazz lovers stand along the edges of the room listening and swaying with the music.  I love this place!

I can't tell you about the food, we didn't order any...it looked and smelled wonderful as plates went by our booth.  We enjoyed drinks and music.  The Moscow Mules in proper copper mugs were good!  Not perfect, but very good.  Lisa, one of the owners, asked how we liked them...we told her a little more ginger and a mint sprig.  You may think the mint is just a garnish, but it truly makes a difference in the whole sensory experience of the Mule!  Lisa was putting mint on the list for next time.  

That's the next thing I need to compliment...the owners CARE!  They want each and every guest to enjoy themselves and to feel at home.  If you want to enjoy a drink and feel like part of the family, you can't go wrong here.  If you're looking for great music in a really comfortable atmosphere with a diverse crowd of music lovers, this is the place for you.  Welcome back, James Street!  Pittsburgh is lucky to have you back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite resturant in Pittsburgh. This place has everything ambiance, customer service, good food and drinks, live music, and dancing. When you walk in it is like taking a step back in time to the roaring twenties with a modern day twist. I have never had bad service everyone is always so pleasant and helpful. The food takes you back to your mommas home cooked meals, definately not something you would expect to from a resturant. They have soul food and a plethora of interesting choices. My husband loves the peanut butter wings and I love their pulled pork sandwhich. While dining you can hear soulful music playing from the lower part of the building in a quaint setting. When we are finished with our meal we usually go down and listen for a while. That music has the ability to melt your cares and sorrows away. I would recommend this resturant to anyone who will listen and will go with you if you don't have a dining partner."}
{"text":"Very cool place to hang out. We didn't eat here...only stopped for a drink. Great beer list, including drafts and bottles. 
There was a meathead at the bar that was obnoxious, loud, with an annoying laugh, so we rolled."}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about this place as my boyfriend and I tried to go here a few days ago and they were randomly closed... I guess for summer cleaning... but omg did this place redeem itself! I had the Mediterranean pizza and my boyfriend had the singing the blues burger... where has this deliciousness been all my life. Wait staff was super friendly and food came out pretty quick. We took the hands off challenge since it was a Wednesday evening and the bag given was a crown royal bag...  classic. I will definitely be back while I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to see Jazz in the city and increasingly other genres of live music.  Brett is a cool bartender upstairs, tip him well and ask him about their many variety of wing sauces.  Their brunch is an awesome deal too with live jazz usually I believe."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a few times now and we have always had a really good time. Great beer selection, bottles and tap, and knowledgeable (and super friendly!) bar staff - that's all I really want out of a bar at step one and they nailed it.

Food-wise I've tried to shrimp po-boy and the fish and chips. The fish and chips weren't bad; not great but not bad, either. The batter on the fish had a hint of sweetness to it that I really enjoyed, but the fries didn't do a whole lot for me. Then again, I still think McDonald's has some of the greatest fries ever of anywhere so ... there's that. ;)

The shrimp po-boy was really effing delicious, one of the best I've ever had! My only complaint against it was that the sandwich bread was really super dense. There seemed to be way too much in regards to the toppings. The shrimp were scrum-diddly-umptious, though. :D 

I love the atmosphere of this place and I think it's great addition to the Northside. It definitely has that speakeasy feel (without the outrageous prices of one downtown speakeasy *cough*): low lighting, dark wood, spacious. If any of that makes sense.

I have not been there during any of the live music performances, but I am pumped that they have Roger Humphries playing there now. Totally checking that shiz out."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely delicious BBQ Burger and seasoned fries here. Honestly one of the best burgers I've had in awhile, with great toppings and a thick patty that was a perfect temp. I also saw some excellent live music in the basement. I'd highly recommend this place. :)"}
{"text":"This place confuses me. Firstly, because I can never seem to remember if I like it here. Yesterday, after having to get some tests at AGH, my husband and I were famished so we walked on over. And on the way, our conversation went like this: 

Me: \"Do we like it here?\"

Husband: \"I don't know.\"

Me: \"Well, the last time we were here... Did we like our food?\"

Husband: \"I think so? Maybe? I don't know.\"

Me: \"I don't know either.\"

So there's that. This place doesn't leave a lasting impression on me.  BUT I'm reviewing a day after a meal there so, no worries readers, it's fresh in my mind.

The second reason this place confuses me is that I'm not sure what it's trying to BE. A hip jazz club? A laid-back dive? Prices say hip jazz club. But menu says \"hey yinz, this is just yer typical bar n'at\"

Don't get me wrong: The food is good, but it's fried bar food. 

Yesterday, I had the pulled pork sandwich and asked to have it on a pretzel bun. It was really yummy. My husband's fish fry was good and the serving size was huge! Our meals both came with coleslaw, but the coleslaw was so bland that neither of us felt like putting in the effort to deliver it to our mouths. I had one drink and we both had side salads. All in all, pretty good meal BUT our bill was over $50 (?!)...

Ehh- I'm still confused, guys."}
{"text":"I highly recommend finding out what time performers will be on at before venturing out here for the Speakeasy. We arrived at 12:15 AM expecting to hear Jazz and were disappointed to find out the gig ended at midnight. It would have been a more enjoyable experience if we'd come for a late dinner (between 8 PM and 12 AM) to see a show.

There were about nine beers - most of which were craft. 

Lastly, I think the kitchen closes before 12:15 AM because there were no plates out when we arrived, but I may be wrong."}
{"text":"This place is big! It's three floor of music and fun. When I walked in I looked around and saw a dinning room but no one is there till later. The place in general plays jazz music and sets up local jazz players and bands to play nightly. I really dig the laid back atmosphere. I sat at the bar and the bartender offered up some menus. I was really looking for a place to watch the game, but I couldn't be rude, I had to get something, I mean I didn't really have a choice. I couldn't make up my mind what kind of wings I wanted so the waitress brought out samples for me to try and waited till I picked two. The waitress gave us a little history lesson on Pittsburgh while we waited for the wings to pass the time. After I felt more like a long time resident (who loves the Giants), then a visitor in the wonderful City. This is a great place to come with a group of people or come alone and get to know the locals. I myself enjoyed the vibe and food so hands down I would recommend stopping in. Enjoy Pittsburgh and enjoy James Street Bar."}
{"text":"Went for drinks after dinner on a Friday night. The bar had a handful of people but nothing crazy. Sat down and it took a good 15 minuets for a bartender to acknowledge us. 3 different girls walked past us. Finally get our drinks (which ended up being so good!) and never see the bartender again. Really could have used some waters as well. Nurse them for an hour and are hoping for another round when we realize the 6 other people at the bar all have empty drinks and the bartender was no where to be found. I go to the restaurant side of the place and ask someone if we can close our tab she goes \"I don't know where your waitress is\". Um ok. Neither do I but that's not my job. Finally she comes walking back in smelling of smoke. Ok cool, take your break but make sure someone else is covering the bar if so. Disappointed but saved used from any hangover the next morning by only serving us one drink!"}
{"text":"I think I will try to come back here when there's some live music going on. The service was just okay. Someone came over before our waitress that was better than our actual waitress. The food took awhile to come out and was nothing to write home about. I really enjoyed the beer I got which was some type of hefeweizen, which is my favorite. The atmosphere was great as well. I ordered the Crunchy Cowboy with onion rings. I see there were many compliments on the rings so figured I should get them. They were kind of bland, but huge and look like they should be full of flavor. The burger was not as spicy as I thought it was going to be. It was actually not spicy at all. Still tasted good though. I think we went at an odd time where they were changing staff and getting ready for the dinner rush and that may be why it was just okay. I'll be back for some jazz and beer."}
{"text":"I always have a great time here.  Their beer selection is top notch.  Service is always fast and friendly.  If you follow them on Twitter, you'll see all the specials (they were awesome during the Pirates season). 

I haven't had a chance to eat here yet, so I'll update my review once I do.  I've heard from trustworthy friends that the food is also excellent, so be sure to try James St!"}
{"text":"A helpful bartender who was sensitive to the time limit of my 2-person party enhanced my experience at this establishment.  My boyfriend and I stopped in for a quick bite and brew before a home Sunday night Steelers game.  We were staying at a nearby hotel, The Priory Hotel, and were directed here due to the close proximity and time crunch we were facing.  The place can accommodate larger groups, as there was a get-together of approximately 20 people seated in the main dining area.  We both had burgers, which were cooked to our specified requests and a few brewskis, of which they had a cooler full of bottles and multiple on-tap.  Don't let the somewhat negative reputation of the North Side deter you...I would come here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience and great beer selection. The peach sangria was awesome! Food is a little on the pricey side for a guy like me, but still a great place to chill after work."}
{"text":"Has to get five stars just for the quality-to-value. Thanks Yelpers for the meatloaf recommendation. Amazing, and a great selection of beers for my first ever night staying in Pitt.  Looks like a nice kids menu as well."}
{"text":"Edited on 2016 July 17th

Was at the music fest last night.  Music great.  Scott and Joanna were new to us -- simply pro quality in all respects.  Sound in the Speakeasy for them was near perfect in no small part due to their understanding of managing mics, voice, and distancing at the right moments.  Scott and Joanna together work very well indeed.

HINT:  Folk need to get reservations for downstairs music events.  We did and had decent seating (and great service).  Others continued to flood into the \"no room left\" venue and stood around the edges.

Our waitress upstairs for drinkies before downstairs opened was excellent.  Lisa, a co-owner was omnipresent and stopped to chat with folk routinely.  Nice touch.  Back lot parking with lights makes access to the venue hassle free.  

Be sure to look at the FB page for pointers to the upcoming events designed to raise monies to sound proof the upstairs.

JS is a nice place and very easy to drive to -- just off 279 and near the sports complexes.  Adequate parking.  Great character in the bar and dining room.  Upstairs ballroom area redone for bands -- sound reinforcement and lights.  Dancing happens there. SWING DANCING happens there.  Last time was with Sweaty Betty Blues Band -- upstairs and basement were both packed.  Downstairs is the Speakeasy, bar and stage and food service. Because the place is broken into sections, one can find a niche that suits one.  Spoke with Lisa (an owner) for 10 minutes -- cordial and helpful.  WWW pages are now up to date.  I am glad that the blues genre has been reintroduced here."}
{"text":"What a terrible place for musicians!  I've never experienced such disrespectful treatment.  We're an established touring group from DC and we were cancelled on just one week before we were supposed to play.  The only way we found out about it was because another band was listed on the website.  I had to call, email, and leave multiple messages over many days to get a response.  Adam, the booker, was curt, rude and dismissive when I brought the double-booking to his attention.  This is the second time we've been cancelled on by him, and he's never as much a apologized.  How unprofessional!  But even more, how rude and disrespectful.  Fair warning to other musicians and music lovers - this is NOT the place you want to play, nor the place you want to patronize."}
{"text":"Great music,  good food and nice intimate ambiance.  Love this place every time! Loving the band!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are back in her hometown and looking for something to do on a Sunday night. She suggested we  go here to listen to some jazz and get some drinks. When my girlfriend told me she never really listened to jazz before I about broke up with her but since she suggested the place, I'd figure I'd give her another chance. 

I did not expect to break my neck this night. 

That is how much head bobbing I did. I was well lubricated with their Basil Bourbon, which nobody even hinted at how amazing it tasted. Like seriously amazing. I'm talking stab your mother and marry the bartender amazing. So we had great music, amazing cocktails and I was already feeling loosey-goosey. Then I had to go ahead and order some carrot cake that was literally bigger than my face (our server warned us but I didn't listen); a dense, sweet, delicious mistake , and that was the final stroke. My neck snapped from the weight of it.

I'm now typing this with my head flapping about my shoulders like a turkey neck. I'm not even mad about it."}
{"text":"It was my first trip back to James Street since they were James Street Tavern years and years ago and I guess I wasn't surprised that a lot has changed. Firstly, my food was delicious and everyone I was with said the same about what they ordered. My burger was cooked perfectly. I had pulled pork & bacon on it and the BBQ sauce was dripping with flavor, ahhh. One of my favorite burgers I've had to date.
The ambiance was just okay which is where the three stars come from. We went on a Friday night to hear the live jazz band that was playing. Jazz  bands play in the basement of the place. It's dark down there and has a big pub feel to it which is cool. It's crazy loud though! I spent the evening screaming to my friends and was grateful for times when the band would take intermission to be able to talk at a normal level.
The band was fun and really talented. It was great seeing them goof off on stage. It wasn't exactly bluesy New Orleans jazz though; more like a muddling of jazz, pittsburgh polka, and rock. 
It was a good time with a group of 4. Taking a date there is probably a bad idea if you want to talk. You could always grab a table on the main level though I suppose where it seemed to be quieter. But even if you can't talk, the tasty food will keep you busy in those inaudible times of jazzy inspiration."}
{"text":"Great food, fair prices. Service was excellent. It was a little weird with live music on a Tuesday night. Loud, but not terribly intrusive because it was upstairs. The place felt a little upscale and divey at the same time. I'm not sure how that's possible, but maybe that was just a weird first impression on my part. 
The spinach and artichoke dip was excellent. I liked that it came with pepper slices. It made for a very interesting combination of tastes.
There were paintings on the wall that I assumed were for sale. Most were okay, but there was one I was absolutely fawning over. It looked a bit like a tye-dye, but I really don't know art.   
Definitely a nice experience and I would certainly go back again. I wish the menu were a little larger, but the selection was varied - something for everyone."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, staff and food.  I love their salads and sandwiches.  The wings are as good as you can get anywhere, and the macaroni and cheese, with the abundant toppings you can add, is decadent.   Creative and delicious dinners and sandwiches, great music, great people, in a beautiful historic building.  It just doesn't get much better in Pittsburgh or anywhere else."}
{"text":"Excellent craft beer list and hot, fresh food. Didn't get to experience live music but, but the look of it, the size of the place probably leads to really loud music. Would definitely go back for the food."}
{"text":"One of the few places you can enjoy Jazz Music!  The Jazz Venue is on the lower level, the food is good , sandwiches, burgers, etc.  The service was also good!  I heard this place was closing soon, it's a shame if that's true."}
{"text":"So this would have been a 1 star review, but I added an extra star because the Thursday night jazz session is good and our waiter was awesome.  Just want drinks and jazz? Definitely a good choice. But you should definitely eat before you come. 

I ordered the \"Twisted Chicken\" sandwich.  My chicken was burned on the edges, dry and there was no sauce on the sandwich. So basically dry chicken on dry bread, topped with melted cheddar, bacon and raw spinach. I ate a couple of fries, the bacon and cheese, then threw in the towel.  Looking at the overcooked burger one companion had and the clumpy grits another had, I knew it wasn't worth it. 

The waiter asked if I had a problem and I told him not to worry about it. When he brought the check he asked again and I told him my issues. He apologized profusely and comped the meal. He jokingly said, \"it's not like you ate most of it and then complained. 90% of the food was still on the plate! There was obviously an issue on our part.\" Good on him.

Bottom line: calling this place a gastropub implies a certain quality of cuisine that they're simply not capable of creating."}
{"text":"Hello Review # 900!  JSG is a great spot to take in a Sunday afternoon Steeler's game.  This place is typical Western PA, old and rickety inside, tons of character, great bar area and friendly service.  We were greeted right away and taken in one of the booths that sit up behind the bar with a perfect view of one of the TV's.

BJ enjoyed some Great Lakes X-mas beer.  For his meal he got their version of a Cobb salad.  Grilled chicken, peppered bacon, hard boiled egg, avocado, tomato, candied onion, crumbled Gorgonzola and a crispy pasta sheet.  Very good sized portion and everything was very fresh.  For me, I needed to get a couple snacks.  I got the buttermilk battered onion rings.  Delicious!  Be sure to eat them while they are still hot.  And I also got the pipe bombs.  They are sirloin steak, bell peppers, jalapeños, pepper jack cheese in a crispy won-ton wrapper and served with Guinness steak sauce.  I thought they were decent, but did get any heat from the  jalapeños peppers, which was kinda disappointing.  

The game was kinda long, so we had to have dessert.  We shared an apple tart ala mode.  It was fantastic!  Really a fun place to visit, good food, great service."}
{"text":"It wasn't the best of times. It wasn't the worst of times. It was just another overpriced meal.

After moving some furniture to my new house with a friend who lives on the North Side, we needed to get some food more in his vicinity than anywhere else, and after weighing some options, decided on the one that might have more available parking, which ended us up at James Street.

For a place that presents itself as a 'jazz' and 'speakeasy' setting, they kind of presented some of the 'look', but it really didn't have the 'feel'. It 'felt' kind of like a TGI Fridays without the 'flair'. Even the background music was so background that only intermittent bass line rhythms came through. The 'air' was mostly filled with dining room conversation white noise. The PLUS was that we weren't bombarded with the usual sports coverage found in 99.9% of the OTHER bar/restaurants around.

The host, who kind of turned into our assistant waiter/busboy, was very nice, and kept up with our table a little more than the waiter did, although the waiter wasn't dismissive or rude. He was just kind of innocuous. He was there, took our order, refilled our drinks, and brought the check, but he wasn't really 'there' in any kind of interactive way. 

The menus themselves were kind of cool, having taken old record sleeves of jazz albums and slit them open and the printed menus were inserted within. The albums themselves were more notable than the menu.  

After perusing the options, there wasn't much in my price range for a meal aside from a plate of wings or a burger, so I opted for the burger. 8 oz hand formed angus patty, swiss and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato on a bun. I figured well, the burgers at Winghart's are half pound, so give it a try. But somehow this half pound was smaller than the half pound at Winghart's, not as flavorful, and was more expensive, served up with potato chips. Fries were another two bucks. 

They served Pepsi products, so I opted for the brewed iced tea. My friend had an order of pipe bombs, which looked like egg rolls filled with meat and peppers, and two beers. The two beers made up half of the bill. 

I saw the ad board for the upcoming 'jazz' nights, and they were all locals, nothing that would draw me in. Exactly why, since the demise of the Balcony, no one brings any of the smaller level jazz artists to town, is a puzzlement. But then again, since the demise of DUQ, no one really KNOWS of any of the smaller level jazz acts anymore, and that certainly didn't take long to happen.

So after all of it, there really wasn't anything about the evening that would draw me back. If I were a higher paid local, or one of the Docs at the hospital, maybe it would be my yuppie fast food joint, but I honestly can't say that I experienced or saw anything that would make me say 'Hey, let's go back THERE!'

It wasn't 'bad', but it wasn't anything remarkable either. It truly was just another overpriced meal in da burgh. (and seriously Yelp? When did $11 to $30 become 'moderate'?)"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The bartenders always pour me a nice stiff drink and make me feel at home.  The brunch is always on point and the speakeasy is always a great date spot.  I even got a handy under the table once!"}
{"text":"Went last night. I had the chicken wings, which were just alright. My wife had the fried chicken breast, collared greens and cheese grits which were awesome. The other reason I'm giving this place four stars is the ambiance and speakeasy downstairs. Great music, interesting crowd, good location (for me) and pretty good food. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good beer selection but the food is just wayyyy too overpriced. My girlfriend and I ate dinner there last night. We paid $8 for THREE pierogis! I got a burger and it was $15 for bacon and feta cheese, that's it. Don't get me wrong, the food was tasty and we'd go back for different items but man for my bill you'd think I got more than just three pierogis and a burger."}
{"text":"I am not sure if it is normal but the smell of fish was prominent when we entered James Street Gastropub and lingered during the time that we were there. We tried to go downstairs where the jazz music was playing but it was already cramped (make mental note to get there early). Seemed like a mix of people. So we headed back upstairs to the bar and eating area which was not crowded at all. The bartender was friendly and served me a $3 beer. We moved over to the dining area as some of us hadn't eaten. The table ordered some fries which were tasty and oh so doubled fried. We ordered more drinks though our waitress seemed aloof and a bit slow. We waited awhile to order things and to ask for our check. If peeps want to go back I will go too but I won't take the initiative as it will forever be known to me as the fish smelling place."}
{"text":"I was just here for drinks. I had fun at the bar. We had to pay with cash because the credit card machine was not working or it was slow or something. It seems that's a common occurrence. Might be a good idea to bring cash."}
{"text":"There are so many neighborhood sports bars (bars, generally) on the North Side, and the James is one of them.

We stopped by after a Sunday Pens game for dinner. It's a decent-sized place, with a bar area and more formal dining area - as formal as a casual spot like this can be. Although it was a Steelers playoff game, the crowd was sparse. Our server told us to expect an overly-friendly service since they were so not-busy. However, she didn't bother us a bit.

The drink list is 15 drafts, with a decent variety of standard and craft choices. 

Food is a variety of tapas-style plates, burgers, and entrees, with specials. I ended up with fried pickles & their roasted Brussels sprouts - I like bitter foods, so sue me. Everything was fine all around. If I was in the neighborhood, I'd stop in for live music or a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Went in with a friend of mine. Waited 15 min. before a waitress came to our table. We ordered drinks while we looked over the menus. That took another 15 min. to get the drinks. We had a long time to look over the food choices and figured out that the prices were gastropub high with bar food stuff. Didn't bother to get any food as it had taken so long just to get our drinks. Drinks were just OK. They just don't seem like they have their s**t together."}
{"text":"JSG is a cool spot for live music near mi casa...but their food is nothing to write home about. I ordered a steak salad that I'm pretty sure felt like I was chomping on a drill bit instead of steak. It was tougher than Mike Tyson. We also ordered the appetizer of greek pizza or something or other. Meh. Come here for the music and only order drinks."}
{"text":"Nice venue for music. I've been to several events here: live music performances, drag brunch and beer tastings. Definitely a North Side institution. Prices comparable to other similar establishments."}
{"text":"This was the second time we have come here. The first time we were here, no one came to our table for a food or drink order for close to 20 minutes before we left. 

This time our server did get our drink orders pretty quickly, though out of the three menus that we had, not one had all of the same pages for drinks which caused some confusion. After that it did take a while until the drinks came, but thats up to the bar not the waitstaff. 

Next we ordered, and then waited. And waited. And waited some more. When the food did come those that ordered wings seemed ok with their selections, though the side of collard greens was mainly untouched. I ordered just a side of mac and cheese, which was a sizeable portion and could easily be a meal, but it didn't taste like anything. I added a bunch of salt and pepper, which helped, but overall this was very disappointing. 

I probably won't be back. The amount of time it took for some wings and a mac and cheese really was too much and the food wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very slow service, which was odd because there was only two other tables with people in the entire place. It took too long to take our food order and too long for the food to be delivered.

Food was okay. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Great place... period.   As a dedicated North Sider, this place brings me back to the original James Street Tavern, only better.  The food is good and sometimes very good.  The menu is pub style and I have tried nearly everything on the menu at this point with little disappointment.   The key takeaways if you are considering:

Food:  Good food, but not exotic.  It says gastropub but not by NYC standards but who cares.  Appetizer menu is limited and a few more healthy choices would help.  I do love the fried oysters though, for me perfect every time.  Some friends have found them spotty.  Burgers are tasty, I like them all.   Food gets a 3.5 stars

Drink:  Great bartenders generally speaking and drinks are relatively fairly priced.  Drafts are solid, nothing earth shattering but it is not a craft beer haven.  Mixed drinks solid, again nothing exotic but always a good and fair pour.  Drink gets 4 stars

Atmosphere:  What can you say, it's the James Street.   Jazz oozes out of the rafters, day and night.   With their steady stream of jazz nightly it has become the go-to jazz club in the city.   Atmosphere gets 4.5 stars

Total = 4.0 stars.  Very good in my view.  

Would like to see some menu changes, and maybe even a few more exotic gastropub like specials.   No complaints though... all good here."}
{"text":"Such a nice atmosphere... It took a while for the food but that's because they were busy, who could blame them!? That's a good thing, it was well worth the wait! Will certainly come here again and will recommend to anyone!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I live in Brooklyn. It seems unfair that Sixpoint (a Brooklyn brewery) ships their delicious Diesel Stout down to James Street in Pittsburgh which charges only $4 a pint, and I can't get it in Red Hook (next to the brewery itself) for less than $6. This is crap.

Anyway.

In addition to having great beer on tap, James Street distinguishes itself as the brightest, most conspicuous \"speakeasy\" of all time. (I think that word has taken on new meaning, kind of like \"college-educated.\") Our waitress was clearly brand new, but exceptionally nice. She might not have known the beer list by heart yet, but she did split our tab into 8 different checks without being asked.

I had already eaten, but next time I'd love to order off the amazing-sounding menu. Although, some things are not my bag, baby:* 

1. I sampled a peanut-butter wing that was ill-conceived. 
2. Personally, I don't think burgers should be served on doughnut buns, but I suppose I wouldn't turn you away if you showed up at my door with one, demanding sexual favors in exchange. 

Overall, James Street has a good vibe, especially with the sweet sounds of a blues band emanating from the bar below. I would appreciate if they turned down the lights a tad, as I tend to appear a lot more attractive in complete darkness...but I'd come back.

{"text":"The service was decent, nothing to write home about. I had their signature chicken sandwich on a pretzel. It came out stone cold. The waitress took it back and reheated it. The roll was stale and it did not taste as good as it sounded. I got a side of brussel sprouts. They were as underwhelming as they were undercooked. My overall impression was \"meh!\" And, I would call that generous."}
{"text":"There's a saying that goes, you don't know what you have until it's gone. That is exactly what this place is. Under appreciated!!!

I just had a great meal, the crazy chicken, macaroni and cheese, dry rub wings, and the most delicious french fries while I was listening to two Grammy award winning jazz artists...on a Wednesday night, for free no less. I gave a donation but did not have to and did not feel pressured to do so. There are not many places like this left on the planet. I was waiting for Mr Miles or Mr Sammy to come out and pick up a horn or microphone. This place is cooler than cool man.  The food was great and my drink was stiff. I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We had a burger, the med pizza and a couple of the beers hey had on draft and we're very satisfied. Gratuity is included in your bill so keep an eye out on that. We are looking forward to coming back soon for drinks and music."}
{"text":"So, the James Street!!!  One of my all time favorite haunts for decades!!!  Sadly, it's just not what it used to be!!!!!
Just came from having lunch with a friend, and while the place was not the least bit crowded at 12:15, the service was mediocre at best!  Not unpleasant, just slow to bring out our orders - I guess that really lies squarely on the kitchen perhaps!  Our orders were both somewhat incorrect and my friend did not get one of the things she ordered at all!  My food and the wine, which both should have been served cold, were room temp and not terribly appetizing!  The restaurant itself, on a very warm day, was uncomfortably warm!!!  
In recent months, my visits to James Street have been hit and miss - sometimes acceptable, sometimes not so great!  In years past, this was never the case!!  On the busiest of nights - always great food, great service, great music - even when it was standing room only!!!!!  Now, much of the amazing jazz is gone and the revised menu, while still somewhat appealing, is a little more generic, and often fails to deliver on taste and presentation!!  Comparatively, it seems to be going the way of other nearby watering holes like Max's Allegheny Tavern and the Park House - younger drinking crowd, average food, less jazz - I guess it's just not what it used to be - perhaps those days are gone for good!!!  Another classic bites the dust!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really, really like this place! The food is consistently good, in some cases fantastic (for the type of food it is, which is an important qualifier). The drink menu is ever changing, but is always great. I live in the neighborhood and if I have visitors who want to grab a bite locally this is always my first choice. Also, the service here is always very nice, albeit sometimes slow, but nothing that would make me not choose to come back. Great place, well worth checking out; excellent feature for the neighborhood!
Also, the lower ratings on here baffle me. I've brought tons of people here, and I've never heard anything less than glowing. So just FYI, if someone has given this place a poor review, look to see what else they've reviewed... those who frequently review chain restaurants and rate them kindly might not be the people you want to be taking advice from. Or maybe you do? Either way just wanted to give a little perspective."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Drag Show Brunch on Sunday February 7th.  The show was great, but the place/food/service was terrible.  First of all it was freezing.  It was so cold that I wore gloves, jacket, scarf the whole time.  Second of all, the show ends at 2 and our food arrived at 2:00 on the dot, we were the last ones to be served.  By then we were ready to leave, we were paying for a sitter, I was feeling ill by the lack of food.  The food was mediocre and overpriced for brunch.  When we paid they didn't even offer us a discount or anything on the food that we ended up consuming AFTER the show. I was livid and I would not recommend this even unless you want to starve and freeze.  I wouldn't have been as mad if they would have at least refilled our drinks in a timely manner and if I would have been comped the meal.  The date ended up costing us $70 plus sitter cost and it was a huge disappointing. We will not be going back and I will  make sure to let others know."}
