{"text":"My friend was in from out of town and we wanted to golf. So he another friend and I go to Twin Lakes (a course the three of us have been playing since it was a \"Country Club\", 20+ years). We show up with only two sets of clubs, my friend left his clubs out of town. We were turned away because it would be a pace of play issue. First we are all around a 10 handicap, second there were about 8 cars in the parking lot. I am upset with my visit to Twin Lakes, the Pro shop worker was very condescending and rude. So we happily left and went down the street to Raccoon Hill, where they were more than happy to have us. I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"If you have been here before and wasn't quite satisfied, you need to try it again!  Daniel, the new executive chef completely changed the menu and it is delicious!  My boyfriend and I went there for lunch yesterday.  While waiting for our food to arrive we walked around and admired the gorgeous view of the lake.  We shared the ahi tuna appetizer which had just the right amount of flavor.  My boyfriend got the steak sandwich which I ended up stealing a handful of bites from!  The steak was cooked perfectly and it melted in my mouth!  I had the salmon special which was cooked with olives, capers, artichoke hearts, and feta cheese.  There wasn't one bite left, I was tempted to lick my plate!  I am a foodie that lives downtown Cleveland in Ohio City.  Living in Ohio City/Tremont area I am surrounded by excellent restaruants.  I am excited that Kent finally has a quality restaurant that has delcious food, excellent service, and a great atmosphere!!!  I was so impressed I just hired them to do all the catering for my company!"}
{"text":"Our experience here was fantastic!! The staff was courteous, professional, and extremely knowledgeable. The course itself was maintained very well, and very challenging. Definitely recommend, and will be going back."}
