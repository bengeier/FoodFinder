{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. I had the chicken shawarma sandwich the chicken was perfect and the seasoning was outstanding. Tons of extras and the place is super clean. The staff is fantastic, they are on their feet and happy to serve. Thank you for this wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a falafel sandwich, and the falafels were pre-made and cold.  Unfortunately pre-made falafels are the norm for Calgary, but most places at least heat them up on the grill for you.  The rest of the ingredients were decent; however, the cold (and dry and dense) falafels were a dealbreaker for me."}
{"text":"Wow! This is the second time I've eaten here and been totally blown away. Fresh, fast and healthy. Super friendly folks running the place as well.  Best meal I've had in Calgary yet!"}
{"text":"I walked in there because two other Donair places were closed.   From the looks it seemed really promising. Lots of nice desserts stocked for display, looked really inviting. However I was up for lunch. I was a bit disappointed how both of the employees had their hands in the food, picking out whatever from the lettuce and then dumping the plate back in the display bin for the customer before me. For my Lamb Donair she picked pieces of meet that had fallen beside with her fingers to toss them back onto my wrap. Some of the lettuce in the displayed bin seemed to have brown edges.    When I was about to pay the cashier took off and the \"cook\" then noticed me and I could pay. Just a roundup for the little customer appreciation I felt before.    Paid over 13$ for the wrap and a can of pop which I found a lot.   I then sat down to eat it but was neither attracted by the smell nor the taste of that Lamb Donair and actually ended up tossing half of it.   Sorry, but there I will not go again."}
{"text":"Horrible service and cold food. I went there late around 7:30pm and the lady was very rude. First asked if I wanted to stay or to go. I said stay, and then she says we are closing soon so you should take it to go. Then why even ask me that question?? And the food was so cold I ordered a platter of the chicken shawarma. And everything was like it came out of the refrigerator, the rice and the meat were that cold. Not fresh at all. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Walked in here on a rainy Saturday afternoon. We were quickly greeted by the chef, maybe owner, with a big smile!  We ordered, I had a chicken shawarma, my partner in crime had a donair. Both delicious. All the ingredients were fresh and tasty. I suggest ordering a shawarma, and ask them to make it for you traditionally. They put fries inside it which brings me right to my happy place with memories of my childhood in the Middle East. Nothing beats a shawarma and a mango juice :)"}
{"text":"Great service, good location, lots of parking, affordable price (we even used a STUP coupon for B1G1 free).   Food was nothing spectacular for me but it's still good so I'd give this a 3 star.  They may have to fix that drainage smell inside the women's bathroom."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best donairs I've had in a while. Staff are a little tough to communicate with however are friendly enough that they'll repeat themselves. Would go here again."}
{"text":"Favourite donair place in the city! Service is excellent. All of the staff are very friendly and nice to chat with! If I could eat donairs every single day without getting fat I would probably eat here daily :)"}
{"text":"Best chicken shwarma I've had in Calgary yet!  The chicken is always moist and delicious.  The regular size is more than ample for most appetites.  I've also tried the pastries which are very tasty.  Pleasant, fast service rounds out this great lunch spot."}
{"text":"It took them over 5 minutes just to heat up a meat pie. Ridiculous. Plus, the pies are nothing to write home about. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and sells itself.. the workers here aren't that nice which is frustrating because it's quite a lengthy process to get your order filled...cleanliness is mediocre. Large selection and great, pricey though."}
{"text":"I have been seeing a number of these franchises popping up all over the city and normally I try to avoid chains as much as possible.  Today I was limited on time and this was the only appealing thing within walking distance so I broke down and gave it a try.   I'm a huge fan of a simple donair, yet there is so many little things that make one so much better than the rest.  The thought of finding a good donair at a chain was so foreign to me that I didn't think it possible.  I'm so glad I stopped here today.    Have I had better donairs?  Yes.  But this was not far off the best of the best.  I was so impressed that I'm sure I will frequent these more often.   To make it even better the staff were incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"I fail for not writing a review for this place.. I've been working in the NE for about almost 3 years.. and have been visiting this place all the time for the past year... FINE.. i'll be honest.. at least once a week for the past couple months.   I have no guilty feeling for admitting that! I love this place! The food is great! I can only speak of their chicken shawarma and chicken plate. I love both! The chicken is very flavourful, but at times has been a littttle dry - but great nonetheless. Though their beets can be a little hard.. but they've gotten much better with this. I love the garlic sauce, and the hommous is great!  Not only is the food great, but I love supporting this place! You can tell it's a family business, and everyone is involved in the success of the restaurant. I've ALWAYS received fantastic warm service.   This is definitely a place I'll continue to go to, and recommend checking out when your starving. (The plate is a LOT of food!)"}
{"text":"Ok, I have to fess up.... I am about 98 % vegetarian, but still have a hankering for the odd McDonalds, donair and such... Things like McD's burgers and that weird donair meat dont seem like meat....anyhow.. that said here are my thoughts on this place.  I had noticed that the Pita Basket was open in this shopping area and wondered \" is it the same as the one downtown? which is AWESOME\". SOOO I checked Yelp on my iPhone and lo and behold I discovered it was their 2nd location ( thanks Yelp).   So upon walking in, I was surprised at how big it was...not just the dining area but the kitchen and prep area.  They were in the process of cleaning the serving area ( although only 4pm) but quickly restocked it and apologized ( not necessary, but nice).  I had a Donair.  It was delicious and just as I remember from downtown. There were plen tiful toppings to choose from, but the creme de la creme is the \"sweet sauce\".  I am not sure what is in it, but it is delicious and makes the donair so tasty.  The donairs are incredibly filling.  The guys who made my donair did so with flair and made it like he was making it for himself. He was pleasant, and professional.   The decor of the Pita Basket is  slightly tacky ( plastic grapes etc) but I like it that way.  OH! I should say I topped off my meal with a Baklava...delicious.  Lots of free parking.  I would go back in a heartbeat, and once again Yelp helped me with my choice to go.  Thanks Yelp, thanks Pita Basket. DEELISH."}
{"text":"WOW !!   Joyce and I went here after a long day of travel and store / site visits. It was close to the hotel and Joyce was kind enough to let me have what I was craving.   Small place, seats 25 people. You order at the counter - everything looks amazing !! We ordered Lamb Kabob plate (which came with Pita, rice (which I choose not to have), turnip, pickles, humus and tabouli, the Chicken Shawarma plate which also came with the same, Babaganoush and a Kebbi and a small spinach & feta pie - oh gosh - went to heaven. Everything was so delicious !!   Garlic sauce - yummy ! How do they do that's ?   Service was fantastic ! I will for sure return !"}
{"text":"First time to this place.  Ordered the falafel plate.  Comes with 3 LRG falafels a large fresh baked pita bread & hummus,  I chose the tabbouleh salad and rice to round it out. All of it tasted very good and  It was big enough to share and still fill you up. Would go back."}
{"text":"Good food bad sevice !! Called because I had a coupon in the mailbox thought I would give it a try the lady said she didn't believe me because she couldn't see the coupon and it's a delivery order I could not use it !? That is Not sated in the flyer dropped off at my home . I spicficaly stated no Olives I got Olives ok !? so I called back the lady called me a lier and said she made it her self and wouldn't do anything about it and also their is nothing she can do I'll never be back  GOOD CUSTOMER Service is everything"}
{"text":"Average.   I live and breath good shawarma.   It was ok.   If you are looking for yummy Jerusalem Shawarma in County hills or shawarma palace in Falconridge.   Nothing here can compare."}
{"text":"Family run shop, the 2 brothers are great. This place has some of the nicest chicken I've ever had. The spices are flowing and it's a beautiful thing. Fresh ingredients and great taste make this spot a must."}
{"text":"Found out that Pita Basket Cafe has a 2nd location in NE, near Sunridge Mall and in the same mall where Best Buy and PetSmart are located.  We decided to eat at the restaurant.  Ordered their the Large Donair - beef is so tasty with that lovely sweet white sauce, loaded with onions and vege.  Giant wrap for $7.50.  FYI:  Pita Basket has wholewheat pitas.    Also ordered their Chicken Plate - chicken is so delicious, comes with hummus, pita bread, tabouli salad, pickled vege, beets.  Very good deal for $9.95.   Will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"I made my way here for no other reason than I was famished and it was the fastest turn to a food joint in that moment, and man I was so glad I did. The decoration and ambiance was un assuming so imagine my surprise to see I had actually entered a Mediterranean joint. The boys there were sweet but what blew me away was my chicken wrap. It was amazing. It tasted sweet, grilled to perfection and huge. Topped it off w baklava and a pop for under ten bucks.  I am a new fan of pita basket and I know you will too.  I noticed many Lebanese customers go in and out which is a good indication that if locals of the community love it , it must be authentic and delish!!!"}
{"text":"I was drawn in by the sign outside whilst searching for food during lunch one day. I ordered the falafel wrap, as is my tradition at every new Middle Eastern place I go to. The wrap is quite large - even the regular size; they use two overlapping pitas. The falafels were ok - not very flavourful and a little dry and crumbly. The toppings and sauces were very standard. There is a check-in offer where you can buy two wraps and get the second one half off. I might try something else here if I come back but I don't recommend the falafel wrap."}
{"text":"I have to revoke my previous statements about Pita Basket being awesome. Lately, when I find myself in the Northeast, I shudder at the thought of stopping over at Pita Basket as it seems as of late the employees MICROWAVE THE FALAFEL and this makes me a very sad vegan. I have also since discovered much better Falafel elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and it's pretty consistent for its other locations! The donairs are great and the choice of garlic sauce or humus (or both) is pretty unique compared to your standard donair joint. The service is okay it's not the warmest but efficient so they don't mistake your order. But once in a while if you smile just the right way or something I'm not sure they give you a sweet and that's pretty great."}
{"text":"I've driven by the Pita Basket Café a few times and on an afternoon that I was hungry, I pulled in to check it out.  I ordered a regular size beef donair and it was pretty darn good!  They don't skimp on the beef or fresh veggies. They grill press your donair if you like and the price is on par with many other similar restaurants.  The interior has ample seating if you'd like to stay and eat in.  You also can order on-line on SkipTheDishes.com before hand for extra convenience.  Overall, I had a positive experience here!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for lunch.  I had the beef pita.  They beef was precut into very thin slices and stored in a warmer tray.  As a result the beef was dry.  The sauce is a too sweet for me.  I would have preferred a thicker, more garlic tasting sauce.  Fries we good.  What they called Baklava wasnt really Baklava and was burnt in the middle.  I would recommend the chicken.  It appears they cook it when you order it, which would have made a big difference.  Prices were reasonable.  I would give it a second chance."}
