{"text":"The place itself is very lovely inside but your self-serving hot table food pricing is basically gouging! $27/kl??! Who do you think you are?! That's absolutely outrageous for some basic food laying under heat lamps which, by the way, is specifically geared towards the lunch crowds. Who wants to pay $30 for some takeout-style lunch?! Piss off!  I got some food the other day, my container was not overflowing with food, busting at the seams, but seemed to be a small enough amount and when I got to the cash and was told that it was $26, I nearly puked. I should have just walked away and left that there but I was starving and had to get back to the office- no time to go elsewhere.   Slapping a fancy name on a place should not warrant you some sort of privilege to jack up costs for mediocre food and take advantage of the people working in the financial district. Get over yourselves!  Do yourself a favour and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Won't be going back to the hot buffet. I had high expectations given the name and the pricetag. And the Le Crueset pots. It was a complete disappointment. I took a small portion or single piece of many of the dishes to get lots of variety and it was all consistently average to poor. The exception was the chicken fried rice which was good. Curried beef was good too. Lemon chicken was too chewy to eat. Jerk Pork I can't comment on because the piece I paid $2.60/100 g for was a big honking piece of fat. Pakora tasted like a ball of flour with little flavour. Noodles had a weird starchy flavour that was not good.Other noodles were greasy and not flavorful. Fish was VERY fishy. I didn't eat most things after the first bite. After reading the other reviews perhaps the desserts are worth it. But skip the hot table."}
{"text":"Great place to find unique snacks and sweets.  The hot lunch buffet offers a variety of dishes. Warning $$$$ it can add up and you might be surprised when you pay. The salmon is tasty and not overcooked..moist and plenty of sauce. The curry dishes are quite spicy for my taste buds but I do enjoy it alot. The staff aren't the friendliest..quite snotty in fact."}
{"text":"The review would be 0 stars rather than one star I'd given the option.  The red velvet cake should've been called a red expensive AF piece of dry cake.  No quality assurance give the McEwan brand at all.  Don't waste your money!   The cake is on the dry side, and definitely not a traditional beet juice and cocoa powder mixture since it's extremely red.  Super disappointed!  Will never purchase the \"mcewan\" made cakes ever again.  If looking for desserts, purchase the delysee made cakes or eclairs.  Do not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"If you're livin' single, might I suggest dropping in around 5:30pm on a week night, ordering a couple of salads and a few slices of the seared tuna to-go at the take away counter (cause you know you aren't searing your own tuna at home, son), and dine in like a boss!"}
{"text":"Wow! Expensive is all I have to say.... Ever go to a restaurant and just feel RIPPED off? That's kind of how I felt leaving McEwan's new open kitchen.   Don't get me wrong, its a beautiful location - located where the old Michel's Baguette used to be in TD centre. Amazing concept of gourmet food. It kind of reminds me of Marche and Pusateri's mix because it has the open kitchen for hot food but also grocery items you can take home. Beware - marketing and packaging will rack those prices up. it's definitely going to cost you more than an arm and a leg $. I stupidly got myself the hot food that is weighed. I chose the Chicken Vindaloo on some Basmati rice. For the small (I mean, really small like a size of a soup container) container that I ordered...It was about $11.00. Keep in mind...it was loosely packed. So....moral of the story? Don't pick the heaviest food for your food by scale item. NOT worth it.  The flavour was there, but of course having had real vindaloo before, the authenticity was slightly off. Chicken was also tough, normally in a vindaloo the chicken is tender. So that was disappointing.   If I come again, it will likely just be for a dessert. But too many affordable reasonable options in the path. Likely won't come back!"}
{"text":"Food here tastes nice. Lots of selections. The daily hot food section is also great. However. Price does not match value. Here is a picture of cream cheese bagel to illustrate my point."}
{"text":"I want to say \"great variety at reasonable prices\" but that sounds nicer than this place deserves. There is a hot bar, a cold bar, a salad bar and a sanwich bar, along with grab and go food and sushi. The prices are generally good especially considering the area. That said, amongst that, nothing is exciting. Salad bar will leave you pacing back and forth with an empty container (worse considering salad bars are a dime a dozen down here, and none are owned by celebrity chefs). Sandwiches are yeuch. Hot food is imo way too heavy for lunch (heavy beef and dairy dishes, limited veg. To each their own). Grabbed a breakfast burrito today. Essentially a dozen scrambled eggs in a tortilla. Refried black beans? Salsa? Cream cheese? Corn? Nowhere to be seen (despite the vibrant sign suggesting so). 6.50 ish is a good price for a hearty burrito, but I promise you, chef Mark isn't eating this garb for breakfast.   Decent grocery variety albeit overpriced. Staff are wonderful. Have not tried the sweets nor coffee."}
{"text":"Something for every time of day. Healthy and delicious choice for every dietary need."}
{"text":"Excellent selections for the health minded individuals.   However, I have to categorically say, the food in the hot food section is awful, whoever is cooking is used throwing spices around and call it flavour. I went once to pick up a quick lunch and not much variety there. I thought I try it, since I like to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt. I went to pay for a large order, which believe me, it was not large; just the container was large. I came to almost $20.00 for dog food. I thought, I'll try it and pay the money...at the end \"Dog Food\". You can get better, fresh salads and hot menu for under $ 13.00 at Pumpernickels..or Longos. Totally disappointed and I would not recommend it to anyone. Thanks L"}
{"text":"In a pinch, I'd say this place is A-ok, but as a whole, I really question the value on a dollar scale. I came in to get some truffle oil because the regular place I buy it from was out. For a gourmet store, I expected to find several brands. There was only one. In fact, I expected to find more brands of nice olive oil in general, but there wasn't much.  Vegetables were insanely overpriced, but they did have a nice selection of specialty greens. I wouldn't buy regular vegetables here. Prepared foods looked and smelled good and I could see this place being a great option for people who purchase their lunch and eat at their desk.   Overall, I feel that McEwan is a place to buy fancy things or staples when you just don't have time to shop elsewhere. It's a convenience thing and they have a wide breadth of products for the busy executive who has the cash to buy this stuff and no time to do a proper grocery shop. So they've found their target market with the location. But I just don't feel that it's a place for a real foodie (who cooks) and there is a difference. If you know good food and are expecting a wonderland and lots of interesting products to check out, you might be a little disappointed.   It's more grab n go."}
{"text":"This place is MAD expensive (like a prepackaged salad will run you $20). However, they have nice cakes here that are good for gifts. I also enjoy their salad bar at lunch (love the Caesar dressing and bacon here), you won't get much food but it tastes better than other salad places, definitely more gourmet. I tried their hot bar before too and while it's pretty good, it will run you an average of $15+ while other hot bars are like $10 for a full box of food."}
{"text":"I have the tendency to come here for after work snacks.  I usually order the shrimps from the cooked food section. The Peri Peri flavour and the other grilled one. Size wise, it is good. I find it a bit dry.  I've also ordered the scalloped, sometimes the marinated coating is a bit thick. But again a very good size scallop.  My favourite is the miso cod, it was juicy and very flavourful with the crispy skin. I want a second piece now even as I type!"}
{"text":"My visits to McEwan only revolve around their pastries. It's a pretty convenient spot to drop in and grab something for breakfast, whilst running through the PATH on the way to work, where the pastry selection is quite decent.   My favourite is the Zucchini Walnut muffin ($1.50 each - a crunchy muffin top with a fluffy interior), and the very mini Von Donuts ($0.99 cents each - Vanilla Bean is my favourite). While it looks like they have the Zucchini Walnut muffins everyday, their selection of donuts vary daily. In any case, it wouldn't hurt to stop by and check out the day's selection.   While admittedly, the pastries are on the smaller size, they're above-average in quality and are super, super fresh. I've never had a stale pastry from here (yet, anyway). So the next time you walk by... take a look at the pastry case. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"McEwan's is the place to go to for when you feel like you need to stretch your legs after sitting for 8+ hours at the office and you simply want to #treatyourself to one of their delicious baked goods. The reason why I say this is because of the prices - my oh my are they high. The lemon tart that I recently treated myself to was $4.99 and it was only about the size of the palm of my hand...with that being said however, the lemon tart was absolutely delicious! The crust was firm without being too hard and the tart itself was the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness. The pastries that I've tried so far are all really fresh as well! I'm down for trying out the eclairs (especially the gold eclair!) and other pastries - but only on the occasion where it's a #treatyourself occasion."}
{"text":"What I recommend indulging in on your next visit:  - Rahier fruit tarts: canNOT go wrong with these - Mini lemon butter tart as well as the chocolate/caramel flavour from bake shoppe - Pleasantville Creamery Ice-Cream: if you're always curious about healthy treats, DO IT. I enjoy the \"Steel Magnolia\" (seasonal) and \"Blondie\" - CoCos-Pure 100% Pure Coconut Water: best on the market; I prefer this (less sweet, more refreshing) over the Nirvana brand - Soup (always 6 in rotation, weekly I believe): 7 bean chili, vegetable broth   Would forego... - Sullivan & Bleeker cookies: not so much cookies as they are flattened baked goods (imagine a flat, cookie-ish red velvet cupcake) - Pop tarts: nothing to write home about - Sweet buns from Harbord Bakery: rather dry and bread-y but if that's what yer lookin' for, power to ya! - Elm Hill Chocochip Cookies: packaging (small pin through plastic pouch), though cute, allows some air leakage which impacts the crispness of the cookies - Salad bar: better value at Fast Fresh - Hot bar: better butter chicken et al elsewhere"}
{"text":"The shrimp and mashed potatoes are very good. The salmon used to be good but today my salmon as u can see wasn't even cooked properly. This is a major food health and safety violation.  The fish is cold and slimy on the inside, is not seasoned and tastes bland/bad. Not to mention that it cost $25.75! This is really disappointing."}
{"text":"Food was garbage here. Rice tasted like chemicals and the broccolis were over cooked and tasteless. I ended up paying $30 for 2 meals. Way overpriced for the low quality that u get."}
{"text":"I would be in so much trouble if I lived closer to a McEwan's. I was downtown today and it's such a treat to grab a latte in the morning and then snacks to take home as this location is close to the parking garage I use.  Today's haul included an amazing praline eclair, blackbird bread, Italian burrata, Mac and cheese and my favourite gnocchi from Fabbricca. Oh and some cute balsamic vinegar pearls that will work nicely with the burrata. To be enjoyed over several days. :)"}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)  The hot buffet is obviously expensive.  If you need a yelp review to tell you that pay-by-weight butter chicken will cost you an arm and a leg, then I'm not sure what to tell you & you probably shouldn't be eating out in the first place.    LIFE HACK:  Get items at the buffet that are either a) light  (think rice, shredded carrots, bacon, cheese) or worth being paid for by weight (think Chicken, beef, almonds, cheese, not cucumbers or tomatoes).    The breakfast buffet is the real star here, quiche, french toast, 4 different kinds of eggs. However the bacon is UNBELIEVABLY greasy.  It's actually disgusting and every time I get some I have to pat it down with more napkins than the actual bacon... it is SOPPING in grease.  There is literally an inch of grease on the bottom of the pan and the bacon just sits in it.  Here's a thought: Drain the bacon on paper towels?  For the price of the place you think they would put more care into this instead of dumping the bacon and grease in a pan.   The desserts are very good & I've gotten a few Bobbette & Belle cakes here for birthdays which are very well made and worth the $$$ .  The pre-packaged salads / sandwiches or \"meal deals\" are the best value here (1 meat & two sides), rather than the pay-by-weight buffet.   Taking away 1 star for the asinine price of the buffet, and another for the grease, also they should not take away the breakfast items so quickly as it wastes food.  Like you can leave the greasy bacon out for the late breakfast eaters (like myself) until you're done bringing out the lunch items & need the real estate IMO.  It's wasteful otherwise (presumably goes in the trash after).  That being said everything is FRESH & very tasty, so with the above in mind you should definitely pay it a visit."}
{"text":"The breakfast hot table is awesome! The cost is by weight and can get expensive as other reviewers have mentioned, which is why I took off a star. My favourite is their Shakshouka, which is poached eggs in a tomato, peppers and onions sauce. The sauce is so yummy so I always add half a slice of bread or potatoes to make sure no sauce goes to waste! They also have this mixed berry French toast which is pretty awesome too. I would skip the normal scrambled eggs, sausage, since you want to get the best quality food for that price!"}
{"text":"this will sound shocking, but i have never bought anything from mcewan's that was bad. the meats, breads, coffees, produce, pastries, groceries and prepared foods have always been fresh, delicious and top quality... exactly what you'd expect from mark mcewan.   the prices aren't cheap, but considering their clientele and downtown rents, it's not unexpected either.   the space is clean, bright and well-used. it's stocked with more things than i would've thought possible.  unfortunately, service is sometimes snooty. that's a big no-no in my books and it's the lone reason why mcewan is a 4 instead of a 5."}
{"text":"Try their Korean Rib Sandwich - slightly marinated kalbi and tempura on a sweet brioche bun with sesami seeds. First lunch in Toronto that I thought was actually good. Their veal parm is also great. Not cheap but decent amount of meat unlike a lot of places where breading is heavy.   Their hot food bar can definitely be skipped. Dishes are a bit dry from sitting there for quite some time especially the fried items although their pankora was pretty good."}
{"text":"Expensive AF but they do have some really fancy and tasty things going on in the store. It's a very pretentious supermarket as it's catered to the 9-5 folks who got the spending power.  One time I was curious to see what the self-serve lunch station is all about... I just picked up a box, grabbed a nice piece of chicken, some jambalaya rice, Brussel sprouts, mushroom and some veggie pakoras... weighed my box at the cash and my lunch costed $23... dude $23 I can get a nice sit down meal somewhere else... I was so afraid to tell the cashier I didn't want my lunch as there were so many pretentious 9-5 folks lining up behind me... Needless to say, their hot food was really good but I wouldn't pay that money to have take out there. #lessonlearned   I also tried their pretty eclairs once... I got 5 pieces and they were nicely packed in a nice box... they were about 24$ for 5 pieces. I would recommend their Blueberry Earl Grey and Hazelnut flavour and they are absolutely to die for.    I would recommend this place for their dessert! But do expect everything to be really expensive.  Overall: 3/5 Value: 3/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Food: 4/5 Location: 4/5"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try to curry lunch bar. Great selection, and the food was solid. Unfortunately it was also exorbitantly expensive. I was pretty judicious in adding items to my take-out box, and a normal-size meal (small scoop of curry, small cup of rice, a piece of naan) ran me $22. I'd only recommend if you're on an expense account or don't have much of an appetite."}
{"text":"It's good but not great. I expected more for the price.  - Sandwiches are good but pre-made which means you can't make substitutions. I'm a pick eater so this was not a good idea. Also some of them look they are sitting there for days.  - Hot table: overall good but the ribs tasted very bad and mashed potatoes were not even warm. It tasted pretty bad and it was super cold. Disappointing for something so simple.  - McEwan juice and sweets: taste delicious but a bit overpriced. You can get good juice and dessert for a better price in any other place around.  - Service is great!"}
