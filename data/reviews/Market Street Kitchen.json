{"text":"I was disappointed this time.  The service was great.  The food however was certainly not what one would expect in the least from a restaurant of this calibre.  My prime rib was tough and rubbery and so was the duck entree which my husband ordered.  I had a solid experience last time around so maybe it was just a bad night."}
{"text":"Delicious! Went for brunch and it was lovely. Great atmosphere and great food. Bottomless mimosas and bloody marys for $12.00. I had the French Toast and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"We stopped in one night and where told they were full the place was empty. I thought it was rather weird but they said we only take reservations.  The place looks amazing and I thought it must be worth the wait.
A couple weeks later we finally got around to making a reservation. Upon our arrival no one was at the front counter to greet us however what appeared to be 4 waiters talking not even 5 ft away and not one of them would acknowledge us. After a couple of minutes we were finally greeted and seat at the table. 
The food is so so very bland and over priced for the portion.

We need a good local place that will stay around I only hope they can figure it out."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. The ambience is very nice, particularly if you're sitting outside. Service was great. Menu choices are good. It's a bit pricey, but hey it's DC Ranch. The food was very good. I'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"We were reluctant to try Market Street Kitchen after the mediocre yelp score, but this proves to be yet another time when the stars, or lack there of, are inconsistent with how impressive this place is...

We started with the steak tartar; served with homemade potato chips and a potent yet delicious mustard. The tartar had a semi-coarse consistency that paired perfectly with the mustard and chips.

My boyfriend ordered the duck breast which was cooked perfectly with a crispy skin and meat like butter. The duck was served with dirty rice with bacon lardons which was a perfect accompaniment. Orange liqueur sauce added the appropriate amount of savory yet not overly sweet flavor to the dish. 

I ordered the baby back ribs. I cut the first rib and the meat literally fell off the bone without any encouragement. The barbecue sauce had the perfect balance of tangy and sweet and was not overdone. On the side was homemade coleslaw and green chile mac and cheese. Both sides were standard and well prepared.

Finally, the staff presented their homemade rum cake which, aside from the beautiful presentation, was light, fluffy and moist. The cake was served with a creme anglaise and goats milk caramel sauce. 

At last, I make no small mention of how knowledgable and friendly our server Kyle was and the manager who dropped off our food and provided a detailed description of our entrées. 

MSK is a gem in North Scottsdale worth experiencing!"}
{"text":"Probably needs more time . . .

Okay, the good part first.  Great place to eat at the bar, nice bartender, wonderful atmosphere, good beer selection.  Great mussels for about $11, not an easy find in Scottsdale.   Fairly good greens with bacon, but certainly not a healthy choice.  The downside?  The green chili pork stew was awful.  Not McGrath quality that you'd expect.  That was a big disappointment and I won't make that mistake again. Going again tonight for a second try.  Will definitely be getting the mussels again."}
{"text":"My wife and I had great food and even better service. Gary in the bar provided some of the best service I've ever had, the management stopped by to check on us and held the door as we left. It was all smiles and kindness. We were treated as if it were a special dinner for us, like an anniversary... The best part is that it was, they didn't know that, and gave us a great experience. 

Green Chile Pork Stew is delicious.
Carbonara is to die for.
Good happy hour
Excellent Staff
What's not to love about this place?"}
{"text":"Overall, a very underwhelming experience for the prices.  Small inside with the majority of tables outdoors on the patio.  They have plenty of heaters for the patio, but if it rains (which is not too often in this neck of the woods lucky for them), they'll be down to about 40% seating capacity.

So many off-putting things happened on this visit, I don't know really where to start....here's the highlights (lowlights?):

1)   The rotisserie \"meat of the day\" was the prime rib on our visit.  By 7:30pm, the waiter came back after taking our order to inform us that they ran out of prime rib for the night!?  Since 4 people at our table had all ordered the prime rib, we had to re-think our orders.  Very unpleasant, as we had come that night with the intention of having the prime rib. So much for that.....

2) The NY steak I ended up ordering was tasty and cooked perfectly, but @ $48.00 for an a la carte steak, I'll head to Mastro's and at least get a basket of bread on my table, and be in plush surroundings instead of a patio facing the parking lot. 

3) The sides were good. We ordered mushrooms and the green chile mac & cheese.  But, portions on the sides were very small & not really enough to serve 4 people (again comparing to Mastro's, whose sides are ample).

4) Service was sort of chaotic with items being brought to our table one at a time by different people. The waiter seemed kinda out of the loop on what was happening at any given time. 

5) Robert McGrath was there & appeared to be \"expo'ing\" food, which had him with his back to the restaurant the entire time.  As he is the \"name\" of Market Street Kitchen, they really should have him out on the floor more, talking to people, checking tables, etc.  Seems a waste of his reputation to have random, management guys with little to no personality as the face of your restaurant.

The problem I have with many restaurants like this in Scottsdale, is that they want to charge top dollar; but don't have the food, dining experience or service to back it up.  They need to get way better at the whole package if they want to compete in this market.  As much as I don't really care for chain restaurants, I could get a tasty steak dinner @ Outback for half the price, get bread and salad included, and better service to boot!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Their pork and green chili stew appetizer was AMAZING. The fresh Snapper was delish. Their Poblano chili and bacon burger was the BEST burger we've had.  The ribs were \"ok\", not memorable. The Salmond pasta could have had more flavor.  Their Rum cake was a fine finish. The chairs are not comfortable...maybe to help move customers in/out quickly(?) We'll return for a quick lunch (burger) soon!"}
{"text":"Takeout horrible. What a way to ruin Minnesota's fish. And some white creamy dipping sauce?!? What was that? Tasted like a warm rancid pickle dipped in an over vinegary mayo...nasty. Back to the Walleye...this place does it all wrong; no flavor on that fish at all...salted used-rubber tires tastes better..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the meal, as were others around us. They have a new menu, and what came out was not what the menu described. Clearly need to either more accurately describe their dishes on the menu or train the cooks.  The $32 lobster pasta came out with  two ingredients  (mushrooms and peas) that were not on the menu and the lobster was scarce. Our service was good - can't blame the server for the problem with the food/menu."}
{"text":"On Thursday, Oct, 5th my daughter and I went for dinner and had the best experience at this restaurant. They served dinner and drinks from the island of Puerto Rico, which took me back to my family meals and the island.  The waitress was absolutely wonderful, professional, and provided the best service.  Thank you to MSK for the a great experience and great food."}
{"text":"I think MSK is a 4* for lunch or dinner, but for Sunday brunch I'm not a fan.  My wife and I ordered the Classic Breakfast : 2 eggs, 2 bacon, tater tots (home made), and 2 slices of toast for $5! I ordered my eggs O/M and they came out very runny- just under O/E.  We ordered our bacon crisp and it came out under cooked.  If they could have improved on the food then for $5 this would have been a great value.

Go for lunch or dinner not brunch."}
{"text":"I want this place to succeed. Market Street needs good restaurants, shops and foot traffic!

Had lunch here with my fiancé, future sister-in-law and future mother-in-law. Good thing it went well. :-) We just had water to drink because of the heat wave that week. They all had the fish tacos and all three gave very positive reviews. One thought it had a little too much spice and cabbage.

I had the MSK burger. It was AMAZING. Great patty, cooked to order, plus Tillamook Cheese, fresh tomato, grilled onions, and gribache - I didn't know what gribache was (mayonnaise-style cold egg sauce in French cuisine per Wikipedia!) but apparently that's a pretty common question. Either that, or they made me feel better about not being that cultured. I am slightly picky but ordered it with no substitutions. I'm so glad I did - it was unique and one of the best burgers I have ever had. I loved the gribache addition! The bun and french fries were also very good.

The non-food details:

The restaurant is a beautiful space with an open kitchen and rotisserie cooker you can see from one side of the dining area. Bathrooms were small but clean. Our server was very knowledgable and cared so deeply I assume he was a manager or part owner. He guaranteed I would love the burger or he said he would buy it for me. I really did love it and was happy to pay. I will be back for dinner or brunch soon so I can give them more of my money - hopefully the dining experiences stay fantastic and this place can keep turning a profit and stay open!"}
{"text":"Well intentioned, but best to wait a few months until they get their act together. We arrived early and the service was initially attentive; by 6:30, the tables were filling up. We only ordered small plates for dinner, but for some reason, our order took 70 minutes to arrive. During that time, we figured the kitchen was freaking out, but it was aggravating that our otherwise okay waiter pulled an MIA -- anything to avoid having to acknowledge the kitchen was overwhelmed and unable to deliver anything. Equally disappointing was the complete absence of a manager -- it wasn't until we were leaving that we realized Manager Matt Heeler was the person hiding behind the front computer and answering phones, even though there was an employee there to do that. Guess he just didn't feel like getting out on the floor and interfacing with every single table of disgruntled guests waiting for their food. Any good manager knows they need to get into the trenches and charm people any way they can -- at the minimum, they should have brought bread out or something to tide folks over to the arrival of their dishes.
Too bad, we were looking forward to a much better experience."}
{"text":"I live in DC Ranch and was really excited that a new restaurant was opening.  The atmosphere was nice (music ok at best).  I asked for a substitute for mashed potatoes and they told me There are no substitutions on sides,  \"The dish is served as selected\",  and the bartender laughed when we asked for a plain cheeseburger!  $14 for 3 fried green tomato slices & 6 little rock shrimp- and it was average at best.  I think the chef & bartender take themselves a little too serious!   When the top restaurants accommodate substitutions, they might want to follow suit.  They are in a location that has a 100% failure rate- let's see what happens."}
{"text":"First time in, great looking layout, and a friendly hostess from Australia always helps:).  Our server was \"Q\" and was extremely friendly and funny!  We did happy hour and enjoyed the burger, tacos, wine and bubbles!  All prepared nicely!  We will go back!!!! Oh and since being here a week from Washington state, 65 degrees and sunny didn't hurt!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot. Food was fantastic and he service was impeccable. If you haven't been, give it a try. IMHO You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken with mashed potatoes.  Chicken was very good but i could swear the mashed potatoes were instant.  While waiting for our food we heard the hostess taking an order over the phone for carry out and they requested mashed potatoes. She stated they didn't have mashed only fries.   I thought that was strange since my meal said mashed.   When our waiter boxed the leftovers he asked if i wanted the grits boxed.  There is no way by the texture were the \"mashed potatoes \" grits.   Not sure if they serve real potatoes and ran out or always serve instant.  Too pricey of a meal for instant potatoes if you ask me."}
{"text":"Went to the Market Street Kitchen for dinner last night. Not very busy for a Saturday evening. Service is always attentive, but the food is hit and miss. Had the barbeque ribs with a side of jalapeño macaroni and cheese. The ribs were just OK, but the Mack and cheese was vinegary. My wife had the fish special with risotto, a very good dish."}
{"text":"My husband and I went around happy hour time, but prepared to have dinner as well. We sat at an open table in the bar but it seemed to take quite a long time for our server to notice we were there and he definitely wasn't what I would call friendly. 

We go out to eat at least 5 or more times per week for lunch or dinner and as such we are exposed to a number of service environments. This was really lacking. It is very disappointing when you spend half of your evening trying to catch the eye of your server. 

My husband had one of their specialty drinks - the dark and stormy - which was ok. I had a glass of wine and then we ordered the Pretzel Crusted Crab Cakes - very dry and no seasoning. The aioli on top was quite tasty and had there been more of that, could have helped with the blandness of the dish. We also ordered the Baby Back Ribs which were dry and overly sweet.

We then shared the Rotisserie Chicken over tamale and the chicken certainly was the best thing about our visit. They have an outdoor rotisserie and this chicken was SO moist and flavorful I wish we would have just ordered it. I wouldn't go back just for the chicken though when there are so many other great choices in the metro area."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and our server Sahle was great! A little expensive but well worth it! Try the steak and eggs and the French toast! So flavorful!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here three times now, and we really like this restaurant.  I was surprised at the negative feedback as we have always had good food and good service. Granted, we have always eaten at the bar where the bartenders have been super nice, knowledgable, and very efficient.  We do like the meat and cheese starter option that comes out on a wood cutting board with fun and tasty sides such as gerchin pickles and chili pistachios.  Have had other dishes which were good and hot.  They have a decent wine list and know how to make a good cosmo!  Decor is nice, modern, clean.  One of our favorite restaurants in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Frequent this hard working bunch!!!!!!!! Creative and Comfortable Menu. Nice wines on tap and some great values on the list(and I hear some new additions should be on soon). Charcuterie board is top notch as was the Filet. Good twist on the Beet Salad with a Pomegranate and Citrus edge. 

Staff is attentive and accommodating with pertinent suggestions to your hunger level and mood. Also nice to see the owners present and engaged with customers...."}
{"text":"Have been there several times and there have been a few experiences that were 5* including service and food. If it weren't for those few excellent times - I would have given them 1 star. I also upped it by 1* because it is not totally the restaurant's fault. However they do hire and train. My experience tonight was the absolute worst. Although they are not a gluten free restaurant they are known to be gluten free friendly. I believe they are for the 'fad' enthusiast! I am a celiac and told our server in 3 different ways what that meant and how I could not have gluten. Long story short - she got me good. I have been throwing up and I feel like I have knives stabbing me. Not only is my blood work going to be all skewed on Monday but it takes 3 months to un-inflame! Gaud I haven't had gluten (although there has been 1 cross contamination) in over 2 years. If I were going to be glutened, I would have made the conscious choice of a bite of real New York Pizza - just one bite!! Slightly above basic restaurant that serves yummy food but not for those with this autoimmune disorder. Unless that is you want to risk it. And yes, I am in agreement with some other reviews, I have had excellent service 2-3 times in the past but the other 2-3 times have been poor. Oh well - done. They have lost my trust."}
{"text":"I would agree with some other reviews. The concept and food are actually pretty good but they've got some room to improve on the management of this place. Just kind of an odd experience each time with the hostess, bartenders, or servers, have visited about 5 times just based on convenience. Make sure you check open hours and which menus are available before you go too as they have off hours where they are open but only offer small menu."}
{"text":"Market Street Kitchen was close by and we were intrigued by the wonderful smell wafting through the neighborhood.  

Our server was great, demonstrated ample personality and visited our table often. I didn't experience the long delays for food that other reviewers mentioned and we came in around 7. 

My girlfriend had the grilled duck and I had the Ahi. 

Duck was great, Ahi, well it is a BBQ joint..."}
{"text":"Yay I'm a fan indeed. We never go wrong here, go early to grab a seat at this DC Ranch staple for dinner service. We first noticed it as our vet is nearby and occasionally I go running around the market area and back along Thompson peak.

Fridays & Sat are prime rib night (practically every day has a related entree special). Hubby and I shared that and the super tasty MSK Burger. PRib was mouthwateringly perfectly pink and medium on the edges as ordered, the au jus is somewhat repurposed into a jelly of sorts type of consistency so more spreadable than a dip-n-dunk traditional method. Always necessary is the dollop of horseradish that's not too pungent but gives that requisite kick. The other star of the dish is the homemade bacon blue cheesy mashed potatoes. Chunks of bacon for everyone on a fried pork diet and enuf tang from the cheese to elevate the richness of flavor and (un)fortunately caloric figures as well!

On to the burger, it felt like a 10oz patty served on a great pretzel like bun with enough density that half the burger ultimately filled me up. With Tilamook cheese and added fresh sautéed onions, keeping it simple is best. At $14 its a tasty choice gourmet burger fit for 85255 zip coders. Loved the seemingly scratch made ketchup too! 

Lastly, despite seldom indulging in dessert we were convinced to try their creme brûlée. What irritates me is over torched brûlée to the point of warm to hot melted custard. But MSK does it right and the vanilla seed packed buttery consistency of their brûlée got high points as it was cool-to-cold upon taste, kudos! Gluttony is a deadly but oh so addicting sin! 

MSK is a crafty joint with gourmet freshness. Also loved that were promptly seated served and out in a scosh over 30 minutes as we had a movie to catch!"}
{"text":"Good service but slow food. I stopped for a late lunch and sat outside. The server was very kind and the water misters made the heat pleasant. I ordered a basic salad with shrimp. It took 15-20 min. The server said they made the wrong salad so they had to make it again. When I originally ordered she offered to grill the shrimp which was a great suggestion. The ice tea machine was out of order. $15 for a salad with shrimp."}
{"text":"This restaurant easily makes a new addition to my list of the worst restaurants in the United States.  A case study in terrible service, food and the way the staff had treated my party, not to mention two of us (myself included) got food poisoning.  I have to say, I was excited to take some friends here for dinner and then the following happened.
- We sat at our table for 30 minutes before anyone came and talked to us to take our order.  This was after we had to ask a waiter to find our waitress.
- After the waitress finally took our order, the drinks took 20 minutes to make it to our table.  Keep in mind, the restaurant was not very busy so i'm not sure where the mix up was.
- Food was terrible, cold and downright disgusting.  By the way, it took forever to finally receive our food.
- When asked how our service was, our table had mentioned how bad the service was and the manager went on to say they would take care of us.  Not sure what this meant, but i finally received the bill - he must have meant we will charge you for everything plus things you didn't even order.  What a joke!  Is this how you treat your customers? 

- DUE TO TWO OF THE GUEST IN MY PARTY GETTING FOOD POISONING, WE WILL BE REPORTING THEM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.  STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT AS IT WAS THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE WE HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED.  BASED ON THE SOME OF THE COMMENTS BELOW, IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE SHARE THE SAME FEELING.  I GIVE THIS PLACE 6 MONTHS BEFORE THEY ARE OUT OF BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience .... Menu and food, average, nothing special. Prime rib (night), unflavorfull. Food to the table, slow. Server good. Wine list good. 

Why I have it 1 Star - 

my wife went to the rest room and was verbally accosted with foul language yelled at her by a bar patron who had too much to drink, besides being a jerk.  Reported this to male manager, owner (? dark hair, mature gentleman) who said not much they could do, but would keep an eye on him.  We noticed they did nothing.  When we left we politely mentioned to the bar patron, no need to talk to a woman like that, and the same manager came back and let us know that everyone needs to be understanding.  

Well, when I spend $350 for dinner in DC Ranch, I'm thinking I shouldn't have to have my wife verbally assaulted by a bar patron the establishment should have asked to leave. 

Female diners be advised ...

Won't be back. Too many better choices in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've Enjoyed Market Street Kitchen each and every visit. Excellent staff, fun bar, professional-and sleek  urban feel. Great menu with a fabulous cheese plate!
Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went to MSK today for lunch with 2 girlfriends! What a delicious, colorful, yummy lunch! We had the FISH tacos. I'm already planning on returning! Great atmosphere and service!  This was truly the best meal I have had in months!"}
{"text":"This was a spur of the moment decision to eat here. The food was well prepared and we were quite happy with how quickly it came out. I love steak tartare and would say their version was decent. Not awe inspiring. The steak frites was very good however. My wife really liked ribs but her ginger margarita was really strong. 

Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I received a gift card from a friend and decided to get lunch to-go. I ordered the BLT salad and my son had the chicken wrap. He liked his food and the portion was good. The salad was a HUGE disappointment. There was not enough ingredients to call it a full salad. It was the size of a side salad. The portion was small and definitely not filling. The taste of the salad was nothing spectacular. I expected it to have a bit more flavor from a restaurant but it had none. Even I could have gave it more flavor if I made it at home. It had such high reviews but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"BACK TO TRY SUNDAY BRUNCH

Given that our dinner early this week was very good, I thought I'd return to try the brunch with one of my kids in tow.

The restaurant was well-filled and active, unlike how I remembered the days of 2013-14 with nothing short of sign-spinner out front trying to get you to come in on Sunday afternoon. Those days are clearly gone as the changes since then have given this place deserved momentum--something DC Ranch hasn't had since the days of Arron Mays' Spanish tapa place. MSK, I believe has found it's footing.

The brunch menu is varied and enticing--to the point of causing the 3 of us to order an appetizer (lollipop chicken wings) because we needed extra time to actually settle  on a choice as so many things looked appealing. Honestly, Proof's lollipop wings are a tad better because they have no skin and thus no subcutaneous fat, but I understand most people who order \"wings\" don't have my same hang-ups.  Just when I thought I had it figured out (pork green chile benedict), the table next to us had their food delivered with items that looked damn good and ones that were not on my short list. 

The waiter (\"Cinque\" it said on the receipt) was patient and well informed about all the items on the menu. He, without a flinch, graciously accepted my wifes complex order (you know the girl that wants the crab from the crab salad on her wedge salad with the dressing from the wedge and the crab salad on the side, with 4 extra lemon wedges, red wine vinegar on the side, regular ranch not bacon ranch when she tries my tater tots and her Arnold Palmer with more tea than lemonade). No problem.

At the suggestion of the waiter, I had the green chili pork stew with a fried egg over it. He was correct, it was damn good, not fatty and it nicely satisfied my craving for breakfast and lunch.

It appeared the bottomless Bloody May's and Mimosa's were a hit restaurant wide, but I was driving so I refrained. 

Overall we were again pleased with the food, service, atmosphere and hospitality. The staff was friendly, casual,  & accommodating and the chef came out to tell us they have a new sister restaurant in Cave Creek, Liberty Station. I will be trying that this week."}
{"text":"What an Experience! I arrived at MSK and was promptly greeted, by who I think was the owner, with a warm and friendly hello. Decor and ambiance was lovely and I couldn't get enough of the rotisserie aroma throughout. I ordered the Walu, a new creation of chef Matt Taylor. It was amazing with sophisticated flavors. It left me feeling satisfied and light at the same time. We enjoyed the unique cocktails and tap wines. Our server was entertaining and knowledgeable. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to have happy hour here since it's in our neighborhood. The staff is super friendly and attentive. The food was good but we both ended up nauseous later in the evening (my fiancé actually got sick). I don't know if it was food poisoning or not but after that we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Although the host was nice, it went downhill from there.
The waitstaff was very slow and kept saying \"my friends,\" when we just met him.
Asked about options, was told something a bit different that results.  The  \"fish and chips\" was one small piece of fish.  The roasted beet salad had three small pieces of beets, which were definitely NOT roasted.  Very small portions for the price points.
Food was mediocre at best -- and then the waiter came over and asked if the food was \"still delicious,\" which it never was.
Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and while the food was well cooked, the experience was not the best. It started off well enough with drinks and appetizers. We  shared the deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes which were both tasty. 2 of us ordered the Doctor Pepper short ribs while my husband ordered the prime rib. At this point is where the evening began slipping away. The server brought 1 short rib dinner and the prime rib, but there was a lengthy wait for the 2nd short rib dinner. It made for an awkward wait for which we were not offered an explanation. The short rib was very tasty, and while it came with Brussels sprouts and tomato grits there were only 2 Brussels sprouts cut in half. It was kind of like why bother. If I had been told the portion of the veg was so small I would have ordered a small plate of the Brussels sprouts. The prime ribs was cut pretty thin and served on a very large plate which made the portion look even more diminutive, together with an equally small serving of mashed potatoes. We moved onto desert and a cheese board. My father's cheese cake and coffee came quickly but there had to be at least a half hour wait for the cheese board, during which time our server pretty much disappeared. My husband and I had also ordered wine which also took forever to arrive, but eventually came well before the cheese board. When the cheese board was finally presented the server said they gave us an extra portion of cheese to compensate for the long wait, but perhaps picking up the tab for the 2 glasses of wine would have been a more appreciated gesture. I am not sure if the problems with the service were due to the kitchen or the server, but long delays between ordering and the arrival of both food and drinks made for an uncomfortably long evening. We talked my father out of going to Flemmings because we wanted to have a more local and original dining experience but now I have to listen to my father complain about a rather expensive meal that was not really that enjoyable of a dining experience."}
{"text":"A chic restaurant with fabulous food...who doubts a James Beard recommendation!?  Our dining experience was as close to European cuisine one will enjoy without crossing the pond.  Gary and Kendall were friendly, helpful, accommodating and more.  A great dining event...did I mention that the food was exquisite and devine?"}
{"text":"Outstanding food with a warm family atmosphere.  
When family and friends are in town it is always a must go! Friendly service, delicious food, perfect location."}
{"text":"Had a good meal, great service, love the sushi style cheese and charcuterie board order form

Really expensive really for a local joint

Great service"}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING! Shared the garden omlet with tater tots and the brioche french toast with a friend and it was delicious!  Service was great too.  The staff was really friendly, and our cups were never empty.  Definitely going to go back."}
{"text":"Great experience here yesterday at lunch.  There were a couple of missteps with my order, but the staff went above and beyond to make things right.  Having just had a really bad customer service experience at another local restaurant, I can't praise MSK enough.  As for food, I had a rotisserie turkey sandwich with Brie on wheat bread, and it was absolutely delicious.  My friend ordered one of their specialities, the green chili pork stew, and finished every last bite.  All in all, a really wonderful lunch.  (Stay away from the peach champagne cocktail though.  It has a weird aftertaste.)"}
{"text":"Great inside, staff was nice, bussers come very quickly, food was below average. We had the Sunday BBQ special, sounds great on the menu, but where is the flavor? Also had the bacon jalapeño Mac and cheese. Didn't go anything for us. The prices do not match the quality of the food. 

The chefs may be famous, but the food doesn't show it. We were disappointed"}
{"text":"Went on 1/25 at 1:45,well after the lunch hour.We split a hamburger,which for some reason the cook couldnt cut in half,we had t do it and put it on a plate (not a major deal,but odd) The burger itself tasted like a frozen unseasoned piece of hamburger,really really bland.The hamburger had bacon,chile,oniontomato,lettuce,aiole spread,and cheese....I think that was to cover up the frozen crummy burger patty.Fries were good,that was about it.This is not a do over.Horrible."}
{"text":"On vacation in AZ and just so happens my lifelong friend is a Chef here. Stopped in for dinner and was blown away. The staff here is incredibly nice and knowledgable when it comes to the menu. The food was incredible! I strongly suggest any of the fish that is a daily selection. We had Swordfish and Opah which was outstanding. And if you have found a way to save room for dessert, go with the root beer float. Made with special order Sarsaparilla ice cream! OMG delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.... By far Friday and Saturday nights for the prime rib is the best!  Service is great and friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome evening. Thank you Brandon. We had drinks from their \"state best\" mixologist and beverage program. Appetizers were tasty, not filling and made us eager for our entrees. Ambiance spot on. Encourage you to give Market Street a try. Won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Loved the good and plate presentation. Great ingredients... Special plates indeed."}
{"text":"First time here, decided to pick up something to go and was very impressed with the service, quality of food and quick preparation. I got the MSK turkey wrap, and it was delicious!! I think this place smokes their own meat which is a plus! I will definitely be back to dine in the restaurant and try something else tasty off their menu!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Market Street Kitchen. We enjoyed salmon, fried green tomatoes, and the market street fish (escolar). The service was great too."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great atmosphere, and fantastic food.  Start with a cheese board app, it is absolutely perfect with wine cured goat cheese and salami.  We had the baby back ribs, short ribs, and mussel spaghetti.  All were perfect but the absolute best was the ribs.  Just the right amount of spice and tender beyond imagination."}
{"text":"Two stars for the staff, none for the food! My husbands fish and chips arrived cold. My fish was over cooked and rubbery, my potatoes cold and the asparagus was burned and limp. Too bad because the restaurant is cozy and has a great atmosphere. I'm sorry to say that we won't be going back."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant! Just moved to the area and all I have to say is wow! The drinks are perfect- I had a top shelf Margarita - The best I've ever had! The food was impeccable and always on point... From their steaks to the fish tacos- you can't go wrong... Oh yeah, and the place is immaculate! Owner Paul has created something really special here... Definitely going to be one of my regular spots!"}
{"text":"Decent place but warning: bottomless mimosas are not necessarily bottomless. The wait staff began to slow our drinks down and give us almost just orange juice. Spoke to the manager and he was very repetitive in saying it was up to waiter to see if we were ok to keep drinking. Waiter stated if it was up to her she wouldn't mind.... Basically, Conflicting messages from staff."}
{"text":"I'm seated on the front patio at Market Street Kitchen beside a weathered metal rail. The midday sun throws its light across the table and my skin with a gentle cooling breeze to follow as a chaser. A server politely places a glass of water to my right as I recline in silence with my book. I put my sunglasses on for the brightness, but chose this spot on purpose.

A text from a friend tells me to try the \"pork chili verde\". Unable to locate it on the menu, I request some help from my server, who informs me that she probably means the Green Chili Pork Stew. I order that and a tall glass of the Seasonal IPA on tap. The beer is delivered to me as I watch the passersby in a contemplating silence.

Raising the beer to my mouth, the smell of it reminds me of my uncle - shirtless in the summers of New Jersey - cooking chicken, hot dogs, burgers at his grill. The image is an unexpected flashback to the questions of my youth. The memory has something to say of manhood, I believe. Taking my first sip of the drink, I savor every drop.

The food arrives as I pore over pages of a book that I brought with me just for this. Closing it, my attention turns to witness what I've ordered. A rectangular plate, neatly sequenced, holds on its left-hand side a small rectangular tub filled with steaming stew and topped with a grilled jalapeño. Arranged, unassuming, to the right: a stack of lightly-grilled tortillas.

I remove the pepper and dip my spoon for a first bite. Flavor - an explosion on my tongue. Reaching for the tortilla, I am pleased to find it fresh and soft and warm. I take small bites, eating slowly. Long, intentioned breaths in through the nose between these bites help to enhance the rich experience. I relish every taste until it's gone.

Putting an arm up on the railing to my left, I take a final sip of beer and look around. The afternoon is a set off some new feature me and all these others chose to act in. A car passes lethargically. Edges of a sign across the street flicker slightly in the wind. Bits of conversation like an auditory chaff trickle past me. I gather my book and keys, and then I leave.

CONCLUSION

Although pricey, Market Street Kitchen does not disappoint. My total meal came to just over $21. The food was fantastic, the service was excellent. The ambiance was equally impressive - it calls to you from the street. I would highly recommend this for a more upscale experience, be it a date or a work lunch. (That said, I quite enjoyed my solo visit as well!)

If you haven't yet been by for a visit, find a way to get here if you can. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

MSK STAFF: Thank you for your outstanding service and delicious food. Thank you for being attentive to my needs without disturbing the silent pleasure of a beautiful afternoon (a true art, when you think of it). I know that I'll be back - and next time I'll bring friends.  :)"}
{"text":"We want to love this place and really did when it first opened.  Its close to where we live in DC Ranch.

However the last two times the service has been painfully slow and the food tasteless.  It's like eating air.
It use to be more flavorful.  Maybe they WASPED it up too much.
The coleslaw tastes like cabbage and mayo.  The Roasted Chicken Wrap had almost no taste. The large salad for $19.00 was a bowl of lettuce and some added shrimp had no taste.
What this kitchen needs is a bolder chef who isn't afraid of experimenting with flavor and getting creative.
The wait staff needs to get their act together and be better trained."}
{"text":"Not good, although it was super busy. Out of two dishes at 8 pm on a Saturday, ordered the walu fish and came out not cooked, the then pan fried it to cook it, but it was not quality fish at all, and no flavor on a sloppy cheese sauce that was supposed to be a \"crab fondue.\"  It's trying to be more than it is and failing miserably, walk a few doors down and go to herb box."}
{"text":"We have been a couple times because we like the atmosphere and this time went in for dinner. In the past we sat at the bar and had drinks and appetizers. The cheese plate is very good and so was the scallops. For dinner this time, I had the salmon and couscous. I was not impressed, it was dry and lacked any flavor. I am not a huge meat eater so I never thought we would eat there for dinner but our friends wanted to go. I must have looked over the menu 100 times trying to find something that looked appealing. I was hoping for a good salad but the waiter downplayed all the salads and none really sounded that good.   Overall I was not impressed with the food and the prices are outrageous. I will happily pay high prices for a good meal but for a mediocre meal, not so much. There are other choices in DC ranch that are much better that I will go to in the future."}
{"text":"What can I say about the food...BBB.  Blah, Bland and Boring

What a disappointing experience.  I should start off by saying that I am not a fan of McGrath - personality wise but, I did (once upon a time) like his food.  Also since I live in far N.S its nice to have options in the area.  We decided to give this place a try last night and what a huge disappointment.

We arrived early for our reservations and were seated directly, the bus boy was very quick with the water - good.

Waitress was m.i.a for what seemed sometime - maybe she wasn't told that she had a table.  But, once she appeared all was good.

Food...not so good.  The signature pork chile seemed bland (not what I remember it to be) but, good enough.  2 entrées, the pork rack and the short ribs.

The short ribs are absolutely drenched in a Dr. Pepper sauce.  They were moist but, I couldn't taste much beyond that sauce even when I managed to wipe it off the meat.  Overwhelming!  The chile risotto, not cooked properly.  Not al dente simply not cooked.  Also room temperature and absolutely no flavor, despite the fact that I added salt and pepper still no flavor.  The dish did come with a little frisee salad with I believe marinated red onions, this was nice - wish I had more of that on my plate!

The pork rack better than the short ribs but, again no flavor.  The restaurants signature and concept is based around the Wood-Fired Rotisserie, one would think this would impart a ton of aroma and  flavor but, no, nothing.  Again BBB and Dull!  The grits might as well have been cooked in nothing but water.

Side - Super Greens, Kale, Bacon, Red Onion, Cider Vinegar - OK there is nothing I love more than kale in any variety and any preparation, I simply love it but, this was the worst thing I've ever eaten in my life.  The kale was tough and had an extremely gamy taste... I couldn't stomach more than two bites then had to send it back.  

Someone did come out to inquire about the kale and offered us another side dish which we declined.  

The service turned out to be very good and we were also offered complimentary desserts which we also declined - at that point we were no longer interested in seeing more from the kitchen.  

I'm not sure whats going on in the kitchen but, clearly flavor is not on the agenda - is anyone tasting this food?   At this rate this may go the way of its predecessors - out of business.

So $100+ later and I wished we had just gone across to Grimaldi's for pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is great for brunch!  Waitstaff is great, the owner visited our table, and everything was wonderful! ...and bottomless mimosas? DONE."}
{"text":"Went back for dinner. Even better than last time. Great service and really excellent food. Firecracker shrimp, followed by fall off the bone ribs with jalapeno mac and and cheese, and a reasonably priced good bottle of wine. What`s not too like. Going back next week to try the Cod & Chips!"}
{"text":"We liked this place. As has already been noted, it's not fine dining, nor a \"foodie\" hotspot, but it's a casual, very comfortable and welcoming neighborhood spot. We were also pleasantly surprised to see some Arizona wines on the list."}
{"text":"The service was good but food ok. They don't give you much food and it's pricey. I was expecting better  experience. I won't be back. I should have paid more attention to other reviews on Yelp for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great location and staff. Casual but upscale. Ribs and roasted chicken were excellent. Had walleye on menu but was really cod, would call ahead of that is what you wanted. We will go again which says a lot in this city of a bazillion restaurants."}
{"text":"Great experience!  The food was wonderful and the service was better than many of the nearby high end steakhouses.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Ky made the experience awesome!  

I really really really wanted to LOVE this place! Great location and awesome round window area with killer views!  

We had reservations made through Open Table. Upon entering the restaurant the hostess greets us at the door (nice touch) but then immediately asks if we'd like to sit at the bar for dinner. My response...\"Um....we HAVE reservations for a table.\"  

After checking, the hostess informed us that our table was not yet available (no problem) so we waited at the bar. Ordered an awesome ZD cabernet and Hendricks/Tonic. We were then informed that the people at our table have been there for 2.5 hours and apparently didn't wish to leave. Ok...if you are going to take up that much restaurant time then please reserve a private room and pay the equivalent of tying up a table that long!

We decided to just sit at the bar for dinner. Ky was outstanding! She was super informative, casual, fun, and so funny! It was great to have entertainment with dinner...we love that!  I had the salmon that was recommended by Ky which was amazing! It didn't have too much other flavors put on it so it actually tasted like salmon. It was cooked perfect and sat upon a lovely pillow of asparagus risotto that was cooked just the way it should. Also had a wee little arugula salad on the side. All in all it was a very well flavor-balanced meal and most importantly...GLUTEN FREE!  Danny had their market fish, which was a lovely sea bass seasoned very well with pasta. We had the roasted brussel sprouts for our appetizer. They were yummy but truth be told they could have been a wee more roasted. They were a bit hard and too bright green for being roasted. 

They have a great happy hour pricing and we will definitely go back to see Ky! If you go...be sure to sit at the bar and ask for her!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as my girlfriend and I are waiting for service. It's been 18 mins exactly since we've been seated and no one has even brought us water. Beyond that I have nothing else to say. Step it up guys! We just moved into the neighborhood, and sucks that this was are first impression ~B~"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in over a year, noticed how full the patio was last night and decided it was time to go back. Sunday brunch was yummy! Breakfast or lunch on the menu and bottomless mimosas and bloodies for $12.  Seriously? Great atmosphere, and great service. My salmon Benedict with Chalula Hollandaise and crispy tater tots were yum! My Hubble had the rotisserie chicken wrap and Cajun fries.  Amazing!  Now we nee to come back more often. 

Casual, neighborhood spot that's foodie worthy as well!"}
{"text":"We love going there for lunch on our Sunday bike rides. The staff is always incredibly friendly. They let us store our bikes next to us on the patio while we eat out there. The food and wine is good."}
{"text":"Wonderful they live up to their mission statement committed to quality and hospitality. Everything went beyond our expectations. Yes really good food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great little find in DC Ranch. The night we went, they had Swordfish as the special. I couldn't believe how good it was! Great environment to hang out as well. I will become a regular there with the great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Visited MSK on October  18. The charcuterie plate was very nice, after that it was all downhill. What is it that makes staff feel entitled to offer mediocre service  and mediocre quality food . The green chili was bland, the orechietti dish was tough and burnt. I sent it back , was not charged for it and no one came over to apologize etc. the manager walked around avoiding contact with customers..........wake up folks your job is customer service, it's easy. The owner/manger was at a table ignoring everyone. A manager told the waitress to take the orechietti back to the kitchen which he should have handled. There is nothing adventurous about this place.Restaurants come and go in this town. Hopefully the next guy will get it. 
It is not on my return list"}
{"text":"Here for a business dinner . 
We have a party of 12. Worst service Ever!
I out if everyone never received my drink. 
 Finally went inside to get a drink.
Asked for a drink and it took forever to receive asked for water because I never received any water finally got it two hours later. 
Ordered another drink waiting, waiting,  waiting for my drink. Already had our food which was by the way appetizers. 
Already done with food but never had anything to drink with it.
Still waiting!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite 'go-to' restaurant near our home.  The service is fantastic and the food spectacular.  The servers are all professional and are very knowledgeable about their menu.  They know how to time your meals perfectly, they know how to pair wines and best of all, they all look very happy to be there serving you!

The food is top notch.  They have some of the best fish I have ever had.  They prepare to bring out the best flavors and textures.  The ribs, short ribs and burger are classics.  As with the fish, they know how to provide a great dining experience with a combination of texture, flavors and appearance.  Have not had one bad thing there and I have worked my way through the menu now!

We try to get here at least twice a month but are finding that we usually go three times a month!  A great all around experience!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, bottomless mimosas made the foot wait bearable. The lobster Benedict was phenomenal, except for the fact it was plain with the no seasoning whatsoever. Also, a member of management stopped by to ask us if we were enjoying ourselves, however it was Easter. Overall, a delicious menu."}
{"text":"We were interested in brunch and saw that it is offered here. We sat outside on a beautiful morning. I started with a bottomless Bloody Mary and they were true to the name. I got refills. We tried deviled eggs and tempura fried bacon as a starter. Eggs good, bacon not so much. Bacon doesn't need to be in tempura. My wife had eggs Benedict and liked them. Friend had omelette and it was good I hear. My steak and eggs was the best thing at the table. Unfortunately the tater tots were seasoned in a strange way that none of us liked though a week later I don't remember exactly what. Service was pretty good. We sat outside because the music inside was so loud that conversation was difficult. At least one other inside table made the same choice a minute later."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped here mid afternoon after playing round of golf and were both STARVING!

He had a pulled pork sandwich and I had the roast beef sandwich au ju with horseradish. Both were absolutely delicious! Even the French fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned!

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Market Street Kitchen is one of our favorite spots for happy hour, lunch or dinner. The food has never disappointed us and the wine on happy hour is a pretty good deal. Usually a Hayes Cab for $5.

Whatever is coming out of the smoker tastes great and the staff are always very courteous."}
{"text":"I went here for a work function. Great service! I had the market salad, roasted chicken (so good!) and chocolate cake. Food was very yummy!  Wish I lived in the area so I could take my husband."}
{"text":"Found my cravings a little beyond the menu tonight so I inquired about a chicken breast dish and to my delight chef Emilio did not hesitate to create a chicken picatta to rival some of the finest Italian restaurants. Definitely a dish of passion. Thanks Chef... Paul 

Oops.....although not a sweets person ..HAD To try the pistachio cheesecake baked by chef Emilio on premises. It was an Italian's dream dessert. Trust me."}
{"text":"We have been here 2x, once for lunch---awesome---once for dinner---great---Service was spot on. Food is prepared at the perfect temperature, timing was exact. Love love love the bbq sauce that was served with the steak. We asked for the blue cheese mashed potatoes that were served as part of a dish we were not getting and they we accommodating. We found an awesome bottle of wine under $50 which is a bargain for us. I look forward to our next visit. I hope they survive the tough customers in this area and win them over!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is good and service was very good.  Had the fish & chips and mac and cheese; both were quite bland and virtually tasteless.  The accompanying tarter sauce was devoid of any flavor.  House salad was decent  Overpriced to boot. Won't be returning there due to ours and friends' experiences being similar to ours."}
{"text":"Service was very good, very pleasant. Slow at times in terms of refilling bottomless brunch drinks but otherwise no complaints for the server or management. 

As for my meal, different story. I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken Wrap and after pulling out a non-edible piece with bone/joint on it I couldn't bring myself to try to finish the rest. 

Other times that I have been here it's usually for happy hour and I order the green chili Which is good, but very heavy FYI."}
{"text":"We found this place as we check out the area...the atmosphere is awesome.  I told my husband that I would be back before the food was served.

O...how wrong am I!

1.  Service was S L O W...it took 30+ minutes for our food (actually, they weren't served until we asked the waitor to check the kitchen and BAM he walked right back with our food!  It makes me wonder if our food was sitting in the kitchen for a while).  P.S.  Less than half of the room (indoor and outdoor) is filled.

2.  We've ordered a steak and egg ($18), an omelette w/4 self-picked ingredients ($14), and a cajun fries ($5).  The steak was about 5oz the most with one egg on top of it.  I asked for medium rare but it was medium - medium well.  Omelette was OK but the tater tots were scattered/broken/over cooked.  The fries didn't come but they gave us a wrong plate.  By the way, our food was in room temperature (I guess I was right that they were sitting in the kitchen for a while).  YUCK!  

3.  We've different waiters (3 in total) at different times as we tried to get our service.  They either walked by without looking or nowhere to be found.  For a moment, we were thinking if we were being discriminate but we realized the large table next to us waited as much as we do.

4.  Yes, they gave us a new steak and egg plate.  It was perfectly cooked and the food was hot.  Cajun fries finally arrived but there was no cajun, just regular fries.

5.  The person who cleaned our table was the best among this lunch experience.  He was smiling the whole time, make sure the table is clean, and refill our glass accordingly.

6.  One more comment...food was way too salty!

VERY DISAPPOINTED!  AT the end, I revised my earlier disclaimer to my husband.  WE WILL NOT COME BACK!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails, great service, the food is hit or miss. I ordered the steak tartar and it was the most delicious tartar I have ever had. It is mixed in a quail egg, cornichon, and capers which gives it a nice salty, Briny flavor that you get with no other tartar I've had before. I also had the fish tacos which were surprisingly uninspired in flavor. It was very basic and bland. So I guess it's a matter of trial and error, hoping for the best.  I won with the steak tartar and the fish tacos were upsetting, but it won't stop me from continuing to explore the menu and hit the jackpot with something else."}
{"text":"The food was lousy and service just ok.  Chicken was dry and overcooked.  My nephew had the same issue.  They took my plate half eaten and didn't offer anything else.  Mashed potatoes tasted like boxed instant no flavor but lumpy.  Terrible waste of time and money"}
{"text":"Went to Market Street Kitchen for the first time today. Nice atmosphere and good food. The lunch menu isn't huge, but has a good selection of salads, sandwiches and more. I had a pulled pork sandwich and my friend had a wedge salad and we both enjoyed our meal. Portions were generous, service was good, and prices weren't bad. I'll definitely go back and try other menu items, but my first impression is this is a comfortable place (nice, but not stuffy), to have a good meal."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Excellent food and staff. Quality and sophistication at its finest."}
{"text":"Always a great spot.  Really like the lunches.  Tonight we had dinner and both had fresh fish.  They were massively overcooked but still tasty.  Be sure to specify how you want your seafood prepared.  Great outdoor tables, good bar scene.  Will go back again."}
{"text":"Mediocre food.  The Mac and cheese was soupy and pork stew way too salty.  Cute place and good for happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant, and I am shocked to see some of the other reviews people have written.  I have tried to visit MSK at least once a month since their opening in October.  The food has always been excellent, outdone only by the quality of the service.  The servers and hostesses are knowledgeable and friendly, eager to take care of customers' needs and answer their questions.  With the creative, ever-changing menu, every experience has been unique but equally enjoyable.

The charcuterie boards are a must - MSK has an eclectic and tasty selection of meats and cheeses, and the presentation is very aesthetically pleasing.  I've only had a chance to sample a few of the Entertainment Plates (read: appetizers to share) from the incredible new Matt Taylor menu, but the Fried Green Tomatoes with Rock Shrimp Remoulade are an early standout.  The Steamed Bouchot Mussels are a Matt Taylor carryover item from the previous menu and are a can't-miss if you enjoy mussels.

When MSK first opened, Matt Taylor (of Noca and Metro Brasserie fame) was sharing the kitchen as chef de cuisine with James Beard Award-winning executive chef Robert McGrath (Roaring Fork, Renegade, etc.).  McGrath has recently moved into a consulting role with the restaurant group that owns MSK, and Taylor has taken over the kitchen and the menu: http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2013/03/matt-taylor-new-menu-market-street-kitchen-robert-mcgrath.php.  The new menu looks incredible, and I cannot wait to get back in there to try some of the new dishes.  The New York Strip with Marrow Butter and Duck Fat Potatoes sounds particularly delicious.

Great wine list and tasty cocktails.  Super friendly and engaging bartenders if you decide to belly up to the bar rather than sit in the dining room or on the patio.  If you like whiskey, don't pass up the barrel-aged Sazerac."}
{"text":"The appeal of Market Street Kitchen is 5 stars! Perfect area, perfect outdoor seating, perfect ambience. Sadly, the food and service didn't match. I wanted it to be great because it is so dang cute.

Bottomless Mimosas for  $10  is the only reason I would be back. 

Food: 
Chicken chilaquilas were not what I expected. I have a hard time liking something when it veers from the traditional style. If it's not broke don't fix it...right?! This wasn't bad but it wasnt great! Small and more of a baked square than a casserole, which is what chilaquilas are. 
Eggs Benedict were very very undercooked, sauce was extremely thick, and worst of all it was cold! Once we told the server he brought back another batch. The eggs were still undercooked and the temperature went up about 1 notch. 
Pet peeve: When sides are not included! We got tator tots. They were good and you could share them, but its not a 5 star restaurant and its not dinner time. Lunch should include sides... Just my opinion. 

Service: 
Ehh. The manager didn't even say anything when he brought over our second batch. When we tried asking for extra plates and silverware they walked away and never came back. We had to ask the hostess for help. Not cool."}
{"text":"Love this place.... Food is good, not to loud, staff is great..... Don't sit outside on the weekend though, with all the noise from the living room bar across the street it kind of ruins a nice quiet date night. Will be returning again."}
{"text":"I live very close to DC Ranch. I invited friends from downtown Phoenix to join us at a new restaurant in DC Ranch.
I made a reservation on OPEN Table, easy enough.

We all got there about 1/2 hour early, we had no problem sitting at the bar. We wanted to sit outside, but there was no available. Again OK.

We ordered Apps. Cheese plate fantastic, Mussels excellent, Crab cakes soso,  

Dinner was mixed.

I had this, very tasty:

'Red Bird' Rotisserie Chicken 
Tamale Pie    16 

My Wife enjoyed this very much:

Alaskan Halibut 
Corn Flake Gremolata, 
Candied Tomato-Jalapeno Salsa    25 

Two people had hamburgers
Inedible
So well done
Problem: waiter never came over once to see if everything was alright. 

That is not acceptable.


Enough said"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night during happy hour and enjoyed dinner for a super reasonable price!  I started with the green chile mac 'n cheese and my husband had the meatballs - both of them were super tasty, but I shouldn't have eaten so much considering I ordered a roast beef sandwich with fries for my meal.  The amazing part about the sandwich combo was that it included a glass of wine of their happy hour wine for $14...what a bargain!  Definitely a great place to visit and have dinner during happy hour!  Great atmosphere and excellent service too!"}
{"text":"Wow...wow. Our first clue should have been that us was relatively slow on a Friday night. Seated...no one speaks to us for 15 minutes. The service was non-existent. Maybe the food is good, maybe not. I won't be going back to find out. A waste of time."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but I think it is a tad pricey.  I had a groupon and thank goodness I did because I would have walked out paying $80 for two drinks and two side plates.  I would go back but probably only for happy hour."}
{"text":"2 of our freinds got food poisoning. Horrible Menu. Horrible Service. Our 8 top waited 30 minutes 3 different times for drinks and salads. Horrible communication and this was for a good friends birthday dinner. They brought us out 'free' deserts to make up for the poor service, but then charged us for the deserts. Went to the owner and he told us this was a \"lose - lose\" situation for us. This place will be out of business in 8 months............

Overpriced, Noisy, bad service, and horrile food........

I was there with Guest G as well..... Please read his review...."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch spot, came from out of town and was definitely impressed with the staff, the food and over all service. We had a larger party and had Anthony as our server, he was fantastic and we didn't have one mistake, I'll def be back my next trip to Phoenix, thanks Anthony for the amazing service, and to the rest of the staff who made such a great morning even better."}
{"text":"I had the MSK burger and it was amazing, great value on the happy hour menu with a wine or beer. This place is one of my new favorites to visit."}
{"text":"The best service!  From the hostess, to the bidder, to the wait staff. Chase was our waiter and treated us like we were the only table he was taking care of. They took such great care of the entire family. Even boxed up a flower my Granddaughter found for her Great Grandma."}
{"text":"This place is in DC Ranch so it is a pretty area to walk around at night.

The restaurant is a unique set-up. The bar is circular and there is a bar section to eat at or a sit down section.  I have gone here twice. Once for drinks which the wine was fantastic.  Another time for food.

The food was excellent. We got a chip dip ate every last bite of it.  Our meals were great as well. I was very pleased with this place.  Oddly it was not very busy for a Friday night but maybe a lot of people don't know about it."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the mediocre reviews before.   Have been by this place many times.   It looks really cool from the outside and in.  To start, the drinks are amazing, albeit not for the faint of heart.  This place knows their liquor!  And not everything vodka and blanco tequila, we're talking the good dark stuff too (they make a sazerac that is as good as any I have had in New Orleans, and that's a lot!).  As for the food, I can see why some people don't like it.  Its adventurous, and probably a bit too out there for some, but I think the Chef cooks exactly how I like to eat, so it gets high marks for me.  My wife would only give this place 3 stars, I would give it 5, so we settled in the middle.  This place is my go-to for cocktails in my neighborhood, and for hearty interesting flavors for dinner."}
{"text":"Really amazing food!!  Started out with a pork app., very nice flavors to it.  Shared the salt baked walu and the Friday night prime rib special both so good. 

For cocktails a must try is the sazerac.

Server was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable"}
{"text":"I had a great time at MSK. The server took the time to get to know preferences and delivered beyond our expectations when it came to drinks and food."}
{"text":"It's been a delight, eaten there twice, Had the order by the ounce meet and cheese as a starter both times. I saw a reviewer complain about the special being sold out and yes that happened to me also, but I ordered off the menu and it was great.  I have the feeling it's a real chef who runs this place and it shows in quality food.  I might give it 5 stars but its a little more casual than that, but I'd feel comfy in a suit or otherwise.  If you haven't been it's worth a try and it really is quality.  I'd knock it on the wait staff but only that they are young and a bit green but nothing rude or wrong, just the two times I've been, but I waited tables as a kid so I know how it goes.. and the food trumps any little issue with enthusiastic waiters..."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. Great location and patio. But, darn it, we've given it THREE tries and had three major strikes. So they're out. 

Their signature dish, the roast chicken, was without question the driest, most flavorless chicken I've ever had. I've had friends report the same, so it was not a fluke on the night we went. All other dishes we've ordered have been strangely lacking in flavor, also. I guess the deviled eggs were okay but, then, those are hard to mess up. 

Prices for basic stuff like Mac n cheese are sky-high and you could do better at the Safeway deli across the street for that.

Service is consistently awkward and inattentive. Maybe they are plagued with staffing issues? Not sure why everyone acts like a newbie.

There are so many yummy places to eat in NoSco - sad to say, don't bother with this one."}
{"text":"We have tried market Street Kitchen on numerous occasions. Tonight will probably be our last. It is a cute place with great ambience, and good food as well as nice cocktails. However, every time we come here the service is painfully slow. Once again, after being seated it took a long time to get our waiter. Then after receiving our drinks it took a long time to get him to come back to take our order. One in our party was having a salad for his dinner which was obvious as that was the only thing he ordered. After a long wait, they serve his salad and it was easily 30 more minutes before we received our other entrées. Then we sat and waited another 30 minutes to get our check and pay. I get it if they are busy, but of the 12 tables in the room there were only three tables with people seated. It is a shame, because we eat out every day of our lives and this restaurant is in a great location for us from both work and home. But with so many options this one is off our list."}
{"text":"Paul, Gary, and the entire staff are great!  The service is top notch, and the food is always exceptional.  The kid menu will also please any child.  From the moment you step in you feel at home, they even make the effort to know your favorite drink.  You are constantly checked in on to make sure you are completely satisfied.  We can't help but to eat here several times a week.  The menu never becomes a bore, each item is always exceptional and exceeds our expectations.  Even traditional items you think you like or don't...will blow your socks off.  We have tried and loved it all.  So thankful to have them in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Impromptu stop here for a small bite.  Did happy hour with two visiting friends from Seattle.  Really enjoyed the place and we were all quite pleased with our food.  Mussels, fish tacos, verde stew and fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"WOW 
I would give this place a 0 star but its not a choice so I gave them a 1

Only been open for 4 days not a good way to start the new place.

I took my  mom who lives right up the street and goes out all the time for dinner.  She really wanted to try this new spot.  
Review

* Service was so slow
* Waiter seemed kinda over it
* Soup took over 15mins to get it.
* Finally after 30 mins the waiter tells us the kitchen is backed up
* Over 1 hour and still no food

Manager really wanted us to come back and give us a meal to come back.  Coming back sounded like the last thing we wanted.  At this time not coming back for some time.

We also had 4 other friends in there to eat and they all walked out to eat down the street.

waste of time"}
{"text":"Market Street Kitchen wins in ambiance but gets a B- in price. I find that the menu items are very expensive for what they are and because of that, we typically opt for other restaurants in the area. However, the patio earns this restaurant at least a three star rating. When the weather is nice, it's enjoyable to sit outside and have some food and drinks. However, I suggest doing so during happy hour otherwise you might find yourself spending a pretty penny on an appetizer, burger and drink."}
{"text":"I hate giving this review but I cant give more than 2 stars. I'll tell you why. We arrived just just 5 min before happy hour started. My husbands order was placed, and no one came back to take mine till 20 min after, so his meal came out 45 min ahead of mine. His fish and chips fillet resembled a sad little fast food patty. Not what you are expecting for $15.
So I don't know if it was new staff or understaffed, but it wasn't busy we were the only people outside  that did not justify bad service, I literally walked past the kitchen on  the way back to the bathroom and saw my food sitting for pick up going in and coming back.
We are not planning on going back here."}
{"text":"We were across the street and wanted to have one more drink and finish watching the game, we sat at the bar and looked at the menu, after we heard the bartender explain the prime rib and fried chicken to the person sitting next to us we ordered one of each. We had no intention of eating dinner and we weren't necessarily hungry! Omg... so amazing. Everything, just..... everything. Stop in here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"DH and I had never heard of Market Street Kitchen until we bid on and won a gift certificate at a benefit for the Cave Creek Museum, but decided to try it out  for our anniversary dinner rather than go to one our usual haunts.  Brilliant decision!  The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a lovely outdoor dining area and inside it's an attractive rustic-industrial chic.  Our server was note-perfect---personable, informative and on-the-ball without being over-attentive.  We started off with a shared smoked salmon ceviche that was generous in portion and hit all the right notes---the fish had the tang of salt, the vinaigrette had a acid bite, the arugula provided a lovely green taste.  DH had the Friday night prime rib special.  The blue-cheese mashers were so good and the slab of prime rib was cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned.  I had the scallops with dirty risotto and wow!  The scallops were properly cleaned and had a gorgeous sear, and that rice....! A bit of a spice and lots of bacon with a little sweet corn mixed in---oh, my!  So, not only do they give back to the community (by donating a gift certificate to the Cave Creek Museum), but then they give you a wonderful dining experience.  Can't wait to go back---our lovely server promised us that the brussels sprouts with bacon are off the charts and I really want to try their fish and chips---one of those deceptively simple dishes that can make or break a restaurant, imho!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the 2nd time two weeks ago with a dear, dear friend. We try different restaurants every two weeks here in the Valley. I cannot get enough of the food and the lovely service that I receive here. We sat at that bar and had appetisers and cocktails. We then ordered dinner and we both had the Filet of Beef Tenderloin. God, it was like butter when you cut into it. I like mine medium rare. It was absolutely wonderful. I'm never disappointed coming here for drinks and dinner. Wonderful atmosphere, great people not snobbish at all. Just friendly and warm."}
{"text":"From when we sat down to food on the table was more than an hour. For...a salad, sandwich and 2 kids French Toasts (1 piece of bread each). Portions on the salad was perfect for someone watching their calories. About a small handful of lettuce and 4 thin slices of 1/2 a pear."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a busy Friday night, and our experience was very good.  I had the filet and my husband had trout. My steak was excellent, he liked the fish, and the service was impeccable. We sat outside under a heater and it was such a treat to be outdoors in January.  Rachael was such a great server! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here and must say it was a pleasure. Right from the wait staff to the cocktails (sazarec), warm olives, heirloom tomatoes, and last but not the least the prime rib. Lets not forget the rum cake. Voila! A fantastic first visit. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Quality location, the food is spectacular,  the setting is perfect  - outdoor area looks over the busy part of DC Ranch.  Perfect for people watching or counting Bentleys.  Indoor is cozy and super relaxing.  Staff is top notch and very naturally nice.  Best part - price is super valuable.  Happy hour deal for 15 bucks gets you a great main, side and beer or wine. Incredible."}
{"text":"I stopped in last week for happy hour.  The bar area is small and cozy.  The modern cowboy decor fits right in with the rest of DC Ranch.

Bob's baby burger was good of course with the green chile on it.  Who really needs the big ass burger any longer when a smaller portion is enough?

I also enjoyed the fish tacos which were breaded and fried perfectly.

Nice friendly service."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and it was busy but we were seated immediately.  The menu is extensive for dinner and drinks.  There are a lot of options to choose from.  Had to make a tough choice. I got the steak and it was very good. We also got the mussel and the trout but the sauce for the trout had to be sent back(only reason not a 5 star rating from me today) The environment is nice with the dim lighting and tvs around the bar. There is also a fairly large patio area if you want to sit outside on a nice day.  Service was good.  Definitely a good place for dinner and would come back."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch, it was around 2:00pm.  The place only had one other table when we were seated.  By the time we left there were 2 other tables, so yes this place was not busy at the time.  But the service was horrible.  The server asked us if we wanted drinks by asking, \"Anybody want drinks?  Anybody?  Anybody?\"  Seriously dude?  Would it have killed you to just go around and ask each person individually, there were only 4 of us.

In terms of the food.  Well just note this was a late lunch and we all only had small breakfasts around 9am, so we were all STARVING.  Like a piece of toast with grape jam on it would have been delicious to me.  Well I looked over at the table next to me, and noticed this boy had ordered the fried chicken.  I really wanted fried chicken, but when I saw the boy took one bite of the drum stick and refused to eat anymore I knew that was definitely not something I should order.

I searched yelp and people said the wraps and burgers were decent so I ordered the burger.  The other orders were a salad with the salmon, a chicken wrap and chicken tacos.

I asked for my burger to be cooked medium.  It came out well done.  I was too hungry to complain.  The burger however was bland and dry, but I was too hungry to stop eating.  The cajun fries are not really cajun fries, they had some paprika on them, not even salt...  The parmesan fries also had not salt.  It was like this place had an aversion to using salt.  Everyone else thought the food was mediocre, the rotisserie chicken seemed to be the best part of the meals.

I will give it to them that the food came our swiftly, other than that nothing good to say about this place.

Also I want to emphasize the fact that the service was HORRIBLE.  The server was rude, inattentive, and looked like he was so unhappy to be there."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 loved this establishment. One of us proclaimed several times that it was the best pulled pork she'd ever had. The deviled egg appetizer was the only disappointment. They weren't bad, just not great. Try the deviled eggs at the Salty Sow. Actually, make a meal out of the deviled eggs at the Salty Sow. But back to Market Street. The tomato basil soup was so good I kept stealing spoonfuls of someone else's soup. We had a drink \"drugs and trouble\" or something to that effect. My boyfriend is an adventurous drinker and this didn't disappoint. Smoky Mescal in it, which I had never heard of. I stole many sips of this too. (He's very understanding.). The space is beautiful and not overly noisy inside at dinner which is especially nice. So many restaurants are so loud it's nearly impossible to converse with your companions."}
{"text":"We were hoping to really love this place. The cosmopolitan I ordered was not a cosmo at all.  It was served in a wine glass and was straight vodka.  I had to send it back for some juice and it just tasted bad.  Unfortunately the Caesar salad and rotisserie chicken wrap were doused in dressing. After opening up the wrap I found about 6 small pieces of shredded chicken, total. The burger was cooked well done after we ordered it medium and my boyfriend actually got sick the next morning after having dinner there.  Coincidence or not, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The restaurant was quite busy even on a week day evening which we took as a good sign.   There are nice seating areas inside, in the bar area and outdoors.    The food was well prepared and had good flavor.  Portions were generous.    My husband had the rotisserie chicken.   He really enjoyed it.    The smoke flavor was a little strong for me.   I had the trout (very good) and the roasted veggies (a little too salty).      We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and you can never go wrong with bottomless bloody mary's or mimosas. We also had the best server Anthony, who was not only cute but never let the drinks go empty."}
{"text":"This place is great for a date or lunch with friends! Great atmosphere and fun staff! I had the Beef Dip sandwich (my go to for any first time visit) and i have to say one of the best I've had yet! Paul the owner is such a cool guy, he made sure all the staff took care of us and that we walked out with a smile! Will definitely be coming back for the great menu and plenty of drinks! Thanks Paul and crew for making my date night awesome!!!"}
{"text":"It is sad to have to write this review because I wanted this concept to work out, but with the lack of quality they provide to their guests, I am not sure how long it can survive. It is sad really because it is such a nice looking restaurant and could have such potential, not like the last three in that space that failed miserably.

I know that Chef Robert McGrath is an award winning chef and as such I can not imagine that he would be proud or even accepting of the foor coming out of the kitchen.

I took my family to the Sunday dinner because the daily special of a BBQ feast sounded amazing. We arrived and our table was ready and our server welcomed us.  

We ordered the filet medium rare with brussels sprouts, of which the filet was well done and the Brussels sprouts were brunt, hey don not ask me for meat temperature if you can not cook it accordingly. Two of us ordered the BBQ feast and it was far from a feast. Bone dry pulled pork that looked and tasted like it was pulled two days ago and then heated up in a microwave. The ribs had not a trace of BBQ, no sauce nothing again bone dry.  The miniature sides, one fork maybe, were as plain as the rest of the meal. So disappointing. 

Our 10 year old ordered the pork Hangar steak which was dry and chewy. To add insult to injury, our  8 year old wanted spagetti and meatballs from the kids menu and what arrived was a soup bowl full of 59 cent  canned spagetti with three minuscule meatballs, at a mere 8.00 charge. In fact it was so bad that we ordered the chicken fingers and fries, of which the only edible thing was the fries. Our server did not even ask why the \"spagetti\" was left untouched and we had to order another meal.

As mentioned before I can not believe that Chef McGrath or Chef Matthew Taylor are proud or accepting of what leaves their kitchen, let alone serving canned food on a kids menu that I would not even feed my kids at home.  Not what I would expect from any restaurant, let alone from a finer dining establishment with renowned chefs.

 Further what about quality control? There are some high-powered and experienced restaurateurs at the helm of this restaurant, perhaps they should spend some time there and ask their patrons."}
{"text":"Not Gluten Free. I called the restaurant asking if the GF on the menu meant that they had a gluten  free burger bun. The girl said yes they had a gluten free bun. When I ordered the hamburger the server was rude and said they could only wrap it in lettuce.  If you want the usual restaurant experience with no real GF options, It might be ok, but the flavor of the food did not make up for the deficit. Don't go here for Gluten Free Options"}
{"text":"Well let me say first that we ate at 5 pm because they told us they were sold out. Next, there were 3 of us and 2 entrees 1 side, 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers and our tab was 160 dollars.  Enough said about prices.  The steak was overdone, while the burger and fries were good. The mac and cheese was the highlight.  When the manager asked about our experience we shared our disappointment.   He told us that our server was \"one of his best\" and how shocked he was.  Server then tossed down the dessert menu and couldn't get our tab quickly enough. If management doesn't want to know, they shouldn't ask.  No need to go back. Phil's grill or Flemings are always outstanding at less than half the price."}
{"text":"My friend had to send her food back as the trout was not prepared well.  It looked like it was cooked in water and had no taste however they told us that was a butter sauce.  They were awesome about taking it back and bringing another dish but the mac and cheese was pretty tasteless.  It appeared that the bar menu looked full but we don't drink.  We are in the process of trying different restaurants and we do not want to go back to this one!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Scottsdale and have tried dozens of restaurants.  I really like MS Kitchen.  The decor is clean, welcoming and modern. The staff is excellent - courteous, knowledgeable, friendly and relaxed.  Courtney does a terrific job in the bar area, and Chelsea is great in the dining room.  Bus boys are speedy and attentive.

The food is delicious.  For great value, I highly recommend the cheese and meat samplers, the entertainment plates - lamb chops and crab cakes are super tasty, and the sides - pork stew and macaroni and cheese are really flavorful.  I've heard the mussels are excellent, so I hope to return soon to try them.

I also really enjoy having wines by the glass at 3, 6, and 9 oz servings.  Such a nice way to enjoy a variety of nice wines.

Save room for dessert - the crime brûlée and rum cake are delicious!

I heard rumors they struggled in the first few weeks, but I recommend giving them another try, they appear to have worked out their troubles."}
{"text":"Ambiance is wonderful with indoor/outdoor seating and an attractive DC Ranch setting. Staff was perfectly accommodating and kind. But, the negative reviews are on target about the food unfortunately. And, after all, that's the main reason we go out to restaurants is for the food. The fish and chips dish, which consisted of one fairly large breaded cod filet, was cold in the middle. Staff was accommodating about rectifying the problem, but it leads one to the conclusion the fish came from a supplier breaded frozen.  The single piece of fish was on a large plate of fries, but no cole slaw or other vegetable accompanied the dish. Others in our party were similarly unimpressed with their dishes. To be fair, appetizers were a decent start to the meal."}
{"text":"My wife have been going here for Thu night date nights since they opened. Always great food and excellent service. Their food and wine prices are very reasonable and decor inside very romantic. They have weekly night specials and the menu changes often. The rum cake dessert is Awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped for drinks after brunch to celebrate a friends birthday and found out they have bottomless Bloody Mary's and Mimisa's on Sunday's. Loved our waitress and the casual but classy setting. We're going back next week to enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Market Street Kitchen has quickly become a family favorite. The menu is jam packed with tasty morsels perfectly sized for sharing. The spare ribs are my personal favorite. 

The staff is warm, welcoming and extremely knowledgeable. Market Street is a neighborhood gem conveniently located in the DC Ranch Marketplace shopping center. There is ample parking and plenty to entertain you either before enjoying a meal at MSK or afterwards. 

Their outside patio is perfect for any season except an AZ summer day over 110. The heaters and misters help keep the patio at a comfortable temperature."}
{"text":"Look at my past reviews. Very very rarely do I give a place 5 stars. MSK deserves 6. Don't be fooled by the crowd at the living room across the street... This place is where the real foodies eat. Service is always top notch and the food is to die for."}
{"text":"Great brunch - be sure and try and deviled eggs.  Anthony our server was attentive and friendly.  Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"This will be my last time to review this restaurant because I'm not going back here, food is not great but not the worst , We ordered the French that taste like a rubber something, and fish tacos is ok but $13 is not worth it I'll just go to rubious."}
{"text":"Soo Good! Had the rotisserie chicken on the wedge salad, the meatballs, and market street salad. Yummulious!!!"}
{"text":"I'd heard mixed reviews on MSK so on our regular Friday lunches out, my companion and I decided to see for ourselves and went there yesterday. Atmosphere okay, service Outstanding, food marginal at best.  Interesting as we arrived we were 1st offered the bar to sit at, mmmmm, interesting offer, but we declined as the place was 1/3 empty, we opted for a table. As I said the service was outstanding and we could have wanted for nothing more, except better food. Kitschy but limited lunch menu, my companion said \"interesting that the menu is 3/4 alcohol\" so she opted for the Salmon, Apple, and Brie flatbread, and I had the burger. I always search for the perfect burger. Well this was not it. Impressive yes, muddled flavors YES.  Huge bun, green chilies, cheddar cheese, large juicy patty with no flavor and a grilled onion made up the offering. The flat bread was beautiful but so salt laden all my friend did is drink water the rest if the day to not dry up from the inside out. I'd possibly recommend MSK for cocktails after work, but for a meal, I'll not be back. We'd had such an AMAZING lunch last week at Searsucker in Fashion Square (fir less $'s) which made our trip to MSK seem so insignificant and not worth the calories. Hopefully something can be done to 'right the ship' at MSK, as DC Ranch Marketplace is ripe for another restaurant to compliment the offerings there. 
So don't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"Great food, and love the outside seating!"}
{"text":"Called to check the wait at 715p and was told no wait. Hostess offered to add our name to the list. We arrived at 730 and we're seated immediately.  Kyle was our server. After being greeted, water is delivered. My  man and I each order a glass of wine, look over the menu. We decide on green salad with goat cheese,  fennel, cranberries, fried green tomatoes, house burger, and short rib. Salad was refreshing, FNT were amazing, perfect crust, thick slices of tomato dusted with cayenne, large baby shrimp, and sauce. Perfect  combination of textures and flavors. Burger had nice brioche bun, meat had a nice crust at medium rare plus, great flavor,  gives Delux competition. Shoestring fries were crisp and hot, not overcooked. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here and have to say we were quite impressed  with the food.  Got there around 5:00pm and order from the Happy Hour menu.  We thought it was a good way for us to share and sample different things.  Order the green chili pork stew , fish tacos and bob's baby burger.  We enjoyed all 3 dishes.  It was more than enough food for the two of us and the bill was less than $30 (no alcohol).  Main dishes sound interesting, but if you aren't that hungry and get there before 6:00pm, the Happy Hour menu is the way to go.  Would give it another star, but don't think it would be fair when we didn't order a main entree.  Plus, there were a couple of quirking things about the place.  The green chili pork stew is served with 3 flour tortillas. When we were have way through with it, the waitress asked how we liked it and if we'd like more tortillas.  We said \"sure\" and she said \"Would you like 1 or 3?\".  What happened to 2? Anyway, we said 1.  She ended up brining 3 to the table.  When she set it down, she said, \"They plated 3, but I only charged you for 1\".  What? You're going to charge me for an extra tortilla?  First, you didn't tell me there was an extra charge and secondly, I hate when restaurants charge extra for stuff like that.  It's so petty.  Like a Chinese restaurant that charges for extra rice or those packets of soy or sweet and sour sauce.  I'm Chinese, so I can tell you just how petty it truly is.  The other kind of strange thing is that they put a carafe of water on the table.  Like the idea, but could you give us some ice in our glasses or in the carafe?  We will be back though."}
{"text":"The omelette I had for breakfast, unfortunately, was unremarkable. Very small for $12 with no sides except for tater tots. I requested toast instead and what came back was two slices of, for lack of evidence, wonder bread toast. Not buttered either.

Asked for a coffee with my breakfast. The staff was overtaxed so they forgot that too. 

To me, it comes off like they're trying to grab some of the weekend breakfast crowd but yet are only half committed to the effort. Was hoping for better because I like the location and decor."}
{"text":"On a whim last Sunday we decided to try some place new for breakfast...but still stay close to our home.  What a find we had in Market Street Kitchen.  The only star deducted was for the bit of a wait getting service.  To be fair it looked like there were a couple of big groups in the bar and the bottomless mimosas and bloody Marys were being delivered by the trayful.  We were more interested in coffee (which was very good) and some great breakfast.  We were impressed with the variety of real breakfast dishes on the menu.  There was an entire section of different tweaks on Eggs Benedict. Peg got the BLT Benedict which was delicious.  I got an omelet filled with green chili pork, sausage...and lots of other goodies.  Breakfast comes with tots instead of hash browns and their tots were addictive!  The servings were beyond generous...we actually took leftovers home.  The ambiance was terrific (it was early) and they had good music going in the background.  All in all it was a great start to our Sunday.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Stumble into this place last night for a quick dinner with a friend from Las Vegas. The service was just great and so was the food! I highly recommend the rib eye and the roast beef, both were incredibly tasty, so tender and juicy. 
The salad options are also a must try! Definitely worth a next visit!"}
{"text":"We were headed to Breakfast Joynt for lunch on Christmas Eve but they had just closed. So we decided to check out this restaurant. It did not disappoint. The service was great and the food was awesome! We all enjoyed all of our dishes. We will be back to try the other items!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Have been there for happy hour and brunch and wasn't disappointed either time. By far the best brunch spot in town; delicious food and bottomless mimosas and bloody marys for $12! The staff is very friendly and the ambiance is homey and rustic."}
{"text":"Whoever gives this place anything lower than 4 stars is lame. Seriously, moved here from San Francisco, and this is the first place in DC Ranch with fish items good enough to get someone from the bay to visit again. Good stuff from the outdoor grill: incredible BBQ skills for ribs and such: better than any other in the area. Chili Mac&Cheese, kids food, burgers, beer/wine, all great. Not to mention, for somebody who grew up with a health inspector for a parent...place is immaculately clean."}
{"text":"Second time here! Salmon salad was top shelf! I had a burger this time. Nice rub on the meat. Last week I had (off the menu) a plate of smoked brisket. WoOW. Great stuff. Even the green tea was outstanding. The atmosphere was casual cool. Bright, airy and contemporary styling. The bar is well stocked. As for tequila... Rosca Patrons are in the house. My available favorite and measure of any place that calls it self a real southwestern spirit purveyor is 1942, which they need a ladder to get it off the top shelf, but it's here! The manager came by and shared his favorite mescal. Great for weekday lunch and Sunday with the wife. Well be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here & we were impressed. Kendal's service was outstanding! The food was amazing... We ordered a bottle of wine & received the cheese plate for free. The cheese plate was the best mix of cheeses we've ever had. There is this pear/horseradish spread that is out of this world. My husband & I just went wheat free & all the dishes are labeled GF & V.  Corn meal trout &  southern risotto (featured in this months Phx Mag) were both very tasty & I would highly recommend. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a great meal, great service. Love sitting outside. Love ambiance. We had trout and paelia."}
{"text":"Very nice.  Excellent service, very good food.  I recommend for a nice, quiet, dinner.  Service considerably better than most restaurants in the area.  Great food too."}
{"text":"I got the Market Salad, and the Market Crudo. Boyfriend got the macaroni & cheese and Fish of the day, Ono with quinoa and celery/fennel garnish. 

-The salad was pretty unremarkable. 
-The Market Crudo was spectacular, it was Salmon that day, and it was some of the choicest slices of sashimi I've ever had, prepared with Salmon Roe, Basil, Grapefruit slices, and wasabi. The menu did say Ponzu sauce and I definitely got served soy sauce. Would have been better with Ponzu. 
-Mac & Cheese was fantastic, rich, little parmesan-y with broccoli in it. You get a small serving but it's so rich you are thankful for it. 


-Service was impeccable. 
-The restaurant itself is GORGEOUS
-SO much fun to walk around \"Market Street\" after eating here"}
{"text":"Met six of friends for Sunday brunch... Bottomless mimosas were amazing! Patio seating was lovely... Food was uninspiring.... I had the tuna tartare... I didn't finish it because it was not that good.. But I probably would go back because the service was great.. I would order something else next time"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place!  A truly unique dining experience that faultlessly blends the best in culinary vanguards with classic comforts through every facet of the restaurant.  The bar features wines on cask and contemporary renovations of classic cocktails along with great craft ales.  Started with a few selections from the charcuterie & fromagerie and then as an un-bashful party of four we dined communally, sampling delights from every section of an exceptional menu.  Crab cakes, scallops, sea bass, prime rib - all spectacular!  The mussels were a definite standout.  Higher quality food than I've had at much more prim & pricey venues, with superb service entirely devoid of pretension. The staff are as warm & welcoming as the fabulous yet comfortable decor.  A fine addition to the DC Ranch neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I happened upon this place by way of groupon, which includes 2 small plates and 2 signature drinks/6oz wine pours.  We had Grilled fish tacos which were nicely balanced and flavorful, and the pork shoulder chili stew.  I had an old fashion and she had the Matt Tai.  Both were great, she was reluctant to share her cocktail.  We rounded off the meal with the Rum Cake for desert (not on Groupon).  It was tasty!

The service is exceptional and the ambience is upscale  rustic and the feel is more intimate than saloon.

Overall very happy with our experience."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in North scottsdale. The vibe, food, and drink list are all great. Service is incredible and friendly."}
{"text":"Loved the restaurant and the outdoor seating. Great place to people watch but the food was boring. I had the ribs. They were just ok and the green mac n cheese that came with it was unimpressive. Bf said his fish was good. He had the trout. It was a nice enough place that I would go back once more and hope that if I ordered something else that I would be more flavorful."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for Happy Hour with a friend after spending the day at the Waste Management golf tournament. We shared several items on the happy hour menu, including the very tasty pulled pork sandwich. Service was good and attentive, and we sat on the heated patio. We both enjoyed our happy hour eats and plan to come back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible service.  The food was over cooked, tasted rancid, or tasteless.  So many poor reviews for good reason.  Tried this place 3 times hoping it would get better.  This last time was absolutely horrible. Never again."}
{"text":"Crazy great cocktails and food! Refreshingly great service. All homemade simple syrups and infused spirits. Try the drunkin gardener.  Nice bar area and outdoor seating! Bartender Anthony is the best! Get the deviled eggs and french dip!  Great find! Excellent location!"}
{"text":"The place is nice, but wow, the drinks are expensive and the place is a little small for comfort.  Food is not bad but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Anthony was an amazing waiter. I highly recommend the pigs in a blanket, salmon benny, Bloody Mary, and bottomless mimosa. Awesome brunch spot!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately was very disappointed :( service was very slow. The drink menu was very strange and not in a good way.. worst of all the chicken was dry! I've had better rotisserie from Safeway. :( I would recommend the living room instead. Hope they can figure things out because location could be great!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here every Sunday for brunch! Great food and great pricing! We always get the bottomless mimosas! The service here is top of the line. Anthony is great!!!!!! And we definitely recommend him as a waiter. The green choke pork stew is AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour. Great food, service and staff. Always on point with everything. Just love this place for a quick bite whne you dont have much time or to enjoy a drink with friends."}
{"text":"Excellent wine selection! And great recommendations by our server for deviled eggs; which where surprisingly delicious as I am not a big Tabasco fan, but the vinegar, and salty flavors were an amazing combination of flavors with the creamy yolk. 

The steak tartare was also an oddly yet pleasant surprise as it was weird to eat raw sirloin, but the combination of flavors were simply perfection! The salty capers, the vinegary cornichons and the creamy egg yolk were a surprisingly yet pleasant orchestra of flavors. 

We really enjoyed the unique decor but you gotta figure out how to blow away some of that wood smoke which can be quite overpowering, depending which way the wind blows.

We're looking forward to checking out your weekly specials. Thank you for a great foodie adventure! See you soon"}
{"text":"I went to brunch here today for the first time and it was excellent! Our server, Anthony, was absolutely superb and made our experience completely memorable. He went above and beyond in service- making us want to come back every week! I definitely recommend the chill brunch atmosphere with bottomless mimosas and solid all round service!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there are poor reviews here - this is a fine place to eat. 

I rate a restaurant based on the type of restaurant it is - this is a restaurant we would go to for weekly dinner. It's not fine dining and it's a cut above average.

We started with the cheese plate. Yummy - we picked vs. let the chef pick. Served with mustard, plum sauce and flat bread thing. The flat bread was interesting, but kinda like cardboard to be honest. The cheeses were very good and the mustard and plum accompaniments were awesome. They have curry dusted pistachios - yum.

I had the skirt steak and frites for my main - pretty delicious. The steak was exceptionally tender for the cut. It came with a tad too much butter - then again, I like butter so not a problem. 

My dining companion had the fennel sausage pasta dish and reported that it was superb. 

No desert...we'll be back..."}
{"text":"Yelp, you slacker! You're supposed to let me know when I live in close proximity to the BEST BREAKFAST SAMMIE EVAR. Holy.

So I've only been to MSK once; they hosted a happy hour for my work on my 2nd day on the job. They set up a cute appetizer display in the back section of their dining room and I remember being enamored by the gigantic walls of wine bottles that surrounded us. I wasn't there too long, but I remember the deviled eggs being tasty and the cheese display with crackers being a treat.

Yesterday we decided to make use of an MSK gift card we'd had a while and landed on them for brunch. I'd stalked the menu online as I am wont to do for basically every restaurant and I thought I'd go with the garden omelet. However, I saw another patron on the patio get her breakfast sandwich delivered and KNEW I had to switch up my order. (Aside on the patio: So perfect on a breezy/sunshiney/thank you Jesus not too hot April morning.)

The goods: Grilly-toasty bread, eggs, white cheddar, spinach, diced portobellos, thin spread of fire-roasted tomato goodness. I left the bacon off, boyfriend kept it. SERVED WITH A SIDE OF GARLIC TOTS? SERVED WITH $12 BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS? (We did our best a 4 apiece. Then I took a 2 hour nap.) WHY AM I YELLING? Because it was absolutely glorious. You don't get an option for your side, so you better like tots (who doesn't?) and not try to be healthy with fruit or tomato slices or something. 

Service was prompt (he knew the importance of mimosa refills), busser/drink refiller and manager were both friendly and chatty. I'll have dreams about the breakfast sandwich for many moons to come. An all-around great experience."}
{"text":"I work next door and go to market street all the time after work. They have the best Moscow mules and an amazing happy hour! They also have really attentive bartenders. This is a gem in dc ranch for sure !"}
{"text":"First time, March 28th, wonderful dinner.  Restaurant was busy and the service was excellent.  Server Courtney did a wonderful job.  The rest of the wait staff was well orgnaized and pleasant too.  Food was delightful, fresh, nicely plated and priced fairly.  Drinks were well pourded and nice selection of crafted cocktails and wines.  Definitely we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great little place in a beautiful area. Patio is a great choice- sometimes has live music. The environment is a 5. Staff was very friendly and the food was above average. DC Ranch is a pricey area, so don't expect great prices unless it's happy hour."}
{"text":"Understaffed !!
Peak season and completely understaffed. 
Went for dinner Sunday evening @ 6:30 and waited for everything  forever. Customers were walking in and walking out. 
How does this happen ?? 
Take a lesson from Local Bistro."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend tonight for the first time. Our server was Casey and he was the main reason we will be coming back. We did have a couple drinks which were great, as well as good food, but the service is what made this experience that much better. Definitely recommend going here to see Casey."}
{"text":"It was my first time here with my BF and it was great. The daily happy hour is awesome! The atmosphere is nice and has some old school items around. The service was really friendly. Our server told us about customer favorites and their daily specials. It's always about the food for me and the food came out fast and was delicious! We ordered two appetizers. Also, the roast beef sandwhich and the MSK burger were great choices for us! I need to go back :p"}
{"text":"I'm left very disappointed. Food was bland, poor quality and even poorer presentation for the price tag. Perhaps the head chef took the night off."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but something has changed. Everything was so bland I had to douse it in salt and pepper. The broccolini was supposed to be grilled, must have been steamed or boiled, and there was no olive oil as the menu indicated. The Brussels sprouts used to be great, but the were just swimming in an oily liquid with no flavor. The rotisserie chicken had a great crispy skin, but also no flavor. The 'smoky' mashed potatoes were just plain mashed potatoes. Super disappointing!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Loved the mac & cheese and fried tomatoes. Friendly service. 
Would recommend"}
{"text":"Great service and food was awesome! French fries were awesome! So was the wedge salad. They were out of rotisserie chicken but can't wait to go back to try! Smells amazing !"}
{"text":"Located in the Market Street Power Center. Follow the hint of mesquite wood burning.

James Beard Award-winner Robert McGrath and Chef Matt Taylor put their chef's whites back on and are working their ovens and a wood-burning rotisserie serving juicy chicken, fish, red & white meats.

The restaurant is pretty casual and has a mixed crowd enjoying craft cocktails, craft beers, cask service and fine wine. I ordered a Dogfish Head 60 out of the bottle. $6. and my gal a small draft 4peaks hefe. $4.

We were first helped by a lovely Brooke to our table on the patio. Thank You again Brooke for helping my Gal and I with the cheese and meat charcuterie. 

We ordered the 10 Year Old Cheddar, Truffle Cheese, the Percorino di Peinza Marzo and the Wild Boar Salami. On the side were a couple of local figs. $9.50. This plate was large and superb.

Notice it will take a bit longer for meat and cheese to be sliced up as they are going to be hugely popular. Allow a little time from ordering the charcuterie and ordering the entrees if you wish to enjoy the cheese, meat and wine before dinner.

Our entrees, the roasted pork loin $23. This plate is a beautiful version of the celebration Posole Mexican Soup with pork and hominy but with three slices of delicious meat. The Posole broth was not too thick but a generous drizzle with very tender hominy.

The McGrath Signature Burger served on a very flavorful and competent dome bun around a thick patty of beef. The burger must be 5 inches tall and came with bacon, green chili, beautiful 10 year old melted cheddar and lettuce.

Our server Kris was super cool and very attentive. And we could see McGrath slaving away in the kitchen. If you need to gauge the timing for your entrees ask your server how long it is taking for plates to come out. McGrath is not cooking out of a can.

On Mondays there's chile-glazed suckling pig and tamale pie $26. Tuesdays, the focus is on Asian-accented air-dried duck with char siu barbecue sauce and red rice $24. Other specials include Friday's whole roasted snapper $26. and Sunday's Mexican-style spit-roasted cabrito [young goat] with enchiladas, tacos and tamales $22. More mainstream main dishes include ahi tuna $25, salmon $23, filet mignon $35 and a pork flat-iron $22. 

This is an excellent medium size restaurant."}
{"text":"Lovely brunch! They have the best selection of Benedicts I've seen and bottomless Bloody Mary's. The patio is lovely. During my most recent visit the customer service was excellent with attentive servers, even the manager stopped by our table. 

My only gripe...the prices are a bit high for the food they offer."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate there last night. Food was very bland and over priced.  Our server was very nice."}
{"text":"NEW MENU!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you stopped frequenting Market Street Kitchen about 4-5 months ago......YOU MUST RETURN!  The food is right on par from when it originally opened.  You will NOT be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Service here is taken very seriously! My boyfriend and I had never been and stopped in for dinner on the patio. Our waiter was Kyle and he was great! Explained the menu wonderfully and answered all our questions! The cocktails were some of the best we've had and the food was amazing! The Brussels sprouts were some of the best I've ever eaten. Drinks were excellent, food was delicious, and the service was outstanding. We already discussed coming back for brunch! Well done!"}
{"text":"Usually a very nice experience.  Not tonight.  Both items we ordered from the menu were not available.  My wife's Roti chicken was not close too up to par.  Her cole slaw was warm!??  My steak, frites were not good.  The steak was cold.  Not sure why it took 40 minutes to serve this food.  They were not busy.  We both thought it was one of the most least enjoyable meals we have had recently.
The server was nice, but not nice enough to make up for a waste of calories, time and $$$."}
{"text":"Bartenders and wait staff are so rude here and the food sucks don't waste your time!!!!"}
{"text":"Disapponting... Very pretty place and the menu looked great.  We were there on a Wednesday so it wasn't too busy. We had the mac and cheese appetizer.  Tasted like plain macaroni, you couldn't taste the cheese and there was no flavor.  I had the salmon and risotto. Again no flavor, the salmon was slightly over cooked.  My husband had the rotisserie chicken with potatoes. Bland and not very tender. We had to ask for salt and pepper which didn't help.  The wine was great, i had a malbac. We sat at a table in the bar which wobbled so we were moved to the next one over, that wobbled also.  The bartender was also our waiter which slowed down service when the bar filled up.  He seemed a little snotty when we asked questions about the menu.  Yelp rated this as four star and the place looked beautiful so we were disappointed. Would not go back."}
{"text":"We received a gift card and headed here for Sunday lunch. The location is a little hard to spot I would for sure use your GPS (in this area of Scottsdale it is very easy to get turned around). I had the BBQ and my husband the fish and chips. My portion size was great but my husband felt his fish was lacking in quantity-although not quality. It was a small filet about the size of fish filet at McDonalds. He said the fish was tasty, would have just liked more and less fries. The ice tea was awesome and I liked that they left a pitcher of water at the table. Awesome super fast service. All in all great meal we'll be back."}
{"text":"Awful! Had lunch on a Sunday with my family and nobody liked the food. Why would expect people to pay to eat this mediocre crap. Also a tip to the restaurant.. Take the deviled eggs off your menu, those are so plain and blah. I don't even know how you could decide to put those on your menu."}
{"text":"I can't understand why a restaurant in this beautiful location can't be amazing.  Ordered a Paloma which claimed to be tequila, Fresca and fresh lime juice. It was literally Fresca and tequila.  Nothing fresh about it, no garnish, boring.  Ordered grilled fish tacos.  No cabbage/lettuce, bland in appearance, not fresh.  When I asked for some cabbage, I was presented with shredded bordering on tan lettuce.  No cholula available so I settled for Tabasco.  No so bad but when I shook the bottle to disperse on to my tacos, the stopper wasn't on and it went everywhere.  Taco soup.  I told the waitress about the bottle so it wouldn't happen to someone else and she said, \"that frickin sucks.\"  Enough information?"}
{"text":"Dependable neighborhood joint.  Friendly service and decent food.  Good bar area.  Seems like a nice, casual local hangout.  A good local place to have a drink."}
{"text":"A group of 8 of us decided to meet for Happy Hour. They were able to accommodate us at the 'Chefs' table next to the kitchen (which was great). T
he Bartender Gary was our server and was quite personable and help make the evening even more enjoyable. 

Gary suggested and mixed some great drinks and the food, both from the Happy Hour menu and from the regular menu was very good.......... 

The only downside was we were sitting under a couple of vents that I think were opened all the way due to being next to the kitchen. So even though it is still HOT outside, several of us were Freezing....

Found the place as it smelled SO GOOD outside as we walked past. They have a huge rotisserie that they do chicken and other dishes. Hard to pass up and we will be back to try the rotisserie dishes too!"}
{"text":"Girls night out!  Woo-whoo!   Not so much....company was great, the food not so much. What a disappointment.  Four out of the six women ordered the chopped salad.  It should have been renamed the onion salad. That's all the four of us tasted.  Offered a second option:  no menu, but manager came out and said what would you like.  Geeze, how about a menu.   Second meal came out much later.  Our other two guests were done with their meal - akward!  2 of us had burgers and the other two salads. This place is known for their burgers.  Sure, if you like salt and mediocre burgers.  Anyways,, all i can say is don't bother.  Instead of comping the meal and making everything wrong right, the manager just argued that they had issues with the salad and its coming off the menu and blah blah blah.  Thought we were \"nice\" women.  Sure we are, but not when all that could have gone right...went wrong.  Accept that there are  issues that still need to be ironed out, but dont blame us for not finishing our meals and voicing our complaints-make positive changes and maybe, just maybe we could possibly considering coming back...highly improbable."}
{"text":"Decided for a casual date night on Market street. 

This is our second time dining here, and could be the last. The first time was OK, and the wife wanted a casual at the bar dining experience and stay close to home.

The décor is decent, and fun people watching, but mostly an old crowd, very few of the 30-50 crowd.

The service was decent. Wine was served warm or room temp, not acceptable to me at higher end places. The food is average, but not bad. Just don't expect a gourmet experience.

Overall we wouldn't return, Hope another one on market street doesn't bit the dust. Sure would be a nice concept of a center street and mingling, but most places in here just seem to crash and burn after a year."}
{"text":"Finally a place in dc Ranch with an urban city feel good staff and good vibe at the bar.  Food drink and service all worthwhile.  Good people washing, loud vibe, but you can still converse with your barmate or table mate.  Parking was a breeze.   Cheers."}
{"text":"I can't believe I gave this place a 5 star rating in my last review. I had such a good experience before and now I will never return. Tonight I took the wife here for dinner to see what dinner was like since lunch was a delight, I ordered the half rotiserre chicken with a side salad and green beans. I asked that my salad be made without Goat Cheese.  I get my dish and see a half rotiserre chicken buried in field greens with a side of green beans. The food looked delicious on the plate. I start eating the chicken at first, and it is moist and flavorful. I then take a bite of some of the salad and buried deep under the layers of greens was the goat cheese. I unknowingly put a large portion in my mouth and almost threw up on spot. Goat cheese does not do well with me. I gave up on my meal immediately at this  point and was left with the sour stomach feeling. I wasnt going to say anything, just really make a mental note that I wont be ordering salads if I go back. My wife decided to tell the waitress on her way to the bathroom what had happened. She approached me and said oh i guess they missed some, which to me either means the salads are premade and sitting out waiting to be served, or they put it on my freshly made salad and someone noticed and said you need to take that off, instead of just making a fresh salad. Either way I find that practice unacceptable. We advised the manager on duty of what had happened, and I think he could have cared less. Its that lack of care for the customer, and the idea of old salad being served that has dropped this place to 1 star in my opinion. I will never go back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time recently. Great decor & friendly staff. Sat inside but the outside dining area looked wonderful. 
The green chili macaroni was good. The Brussel sprouts were amazing!!  Yum yum. 
I had the wedge salad which consisted of a quarter slice of lettuce with all the good stuff surrounding it. For $12 they can do better with a bigger wedge!  
Hubby had the burger which was good. However what is with these places that think they need to forgo the path of the true burger?  No regular mustard!!  Only Dijon. Come on, a burger without yellow mustard. Then they serve some bastardized ketchup!  How bout just plain old regular ketchup?  Had to request pickles & was brought out baby dills that hubby had to slice up to put on his burger!!!! Really?  There is a Safeway in the same parking lot. Go buy a bottle of hamburger pickles & a jar of yellow mustard for us not so snobby diners. 
The large beer was a 12 oz one!  Charged $6. I had some fancy martini sweet like drink that I had to request mineral water & ice for, it was so syrupy. It was $12 & a tiny little glass. 
Probably will not return here. Much better more generous places nearby. 
Get over yourselves DC Ranch"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance yesterday to check this place out but am now wondering if going on a holiday was a bad idea...

I understand that working on a holiday is not the most fun but how is that my problem, I wish that somebody, anybody had put a smile on there face here yesterday or looked liked they enjoyed being there. The only person that was remotely social was the manager that brought out our food. You would think sitting at the bar would get you better service but not all, even when they weren't busy.

On to the food...

We ordered the Meatballs, Green chili mac n cheese and a Caesar salad. All pretty good and a great price all on there happy hour menu witch had a lot more options. Also had to try the MKS Burger, great and would definitely get again and also included a drink with it. But... My wife ordered the roast beef sandwich. Sounded really good and looked really good when it got to the table but turned out to be really fatty. By the end of the meal, my wife had a pile of fatty half chewed meat on one side of the plate. We were hoping that the bartender would have done more than say \"Sorry about that\" but I guess customer service is not a high point here."}
{"text":"Lots of mistakes, failed makeup attempts, with good food and great ambiance.

My husband and I came here on 11/12/15. He loved the pseudo-carbonara and insisted I try it. I did. I also found it great - but not to-die-for. Bacon was crispy, the noodles thin spaghetti, but not traditional.

I love the sexy ambiance of the bar area, as well as the rounded and windowed features in this area. It was Thursday and we opted out of the bottle and board special. The bar was not full and it was happy hour. We started our night off with the bartender saying welcome and I'll be right with you. Literally, 10 minutes later he returned. He seemed much more focused on bringing other customers refills (taking refill orders) and bringing waters, than to stop over at our table. 

Once he did stop over, we ordered cocktails not on the happy hour menu and the fried green tomatoes. Now, I am not a big fan of tomatoes because they are slimy and slippery but these were firm, tangy, crispy from the perfect fry served over a spicy sauce with shrimp. They were a great treat we both enjoyed and had to debate the last one! 

I ordered a ceasar salad and the carbonara - in fact the bartender even recommended the salad. My husband ordered the short ribs. We also ordered a round of happy hour beverages to go with our food. Unfortunately, the mistakes continued and my salad was not served. There was confusion on when to serve it so I suppose they decided NEVER was most appropriate. In honesty, I said I didn't want it since I was already eating the entree. The bar tender came back over and said he messed up putting it in too late. OK... The short ribs contained a LOT of fat but were tasty and well seasoned.

As we were winding down, the bartender showed back up with Pati's rum cake - his favorite so he told us. To help rectify the situation, he said the rum cake was on the house and he removed the happy hour cocktails and gave us the local discount - which we WERE already. Sadly, he STILL CHARGED US FOR A DESSERT WE NEVER ORDERED. The local discount is applied for locals dining locally - which we were doing and would have received regardless. The point is that we never ordered the rum cake and never wanted the rum cake. I don't want dessert, I want good service. I have the receipt still if the bartender remembers this night. I didn't like the rum cake, but it's one of my husband's favorites only with more rum. 

If you mess up so much you decide to bring a consolation dessert, do NOT charge the customer for something they didn't order.

I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Stopped by here by accident to grab lunch.  Very nice atmosphere.  Casual but with very cool decorations.  Love the Edison lights wired into the bar!  We both ordered the BLT.  Beautiful presentation, huge pieces of smokey bacon, yummy deviled-egg mayo, tomato didn't have too much flavor but they rarely do this time of year.  Only negative was that it wasn't terribly busy and it took a bit of time to get our food.  Not a real big problem. I would love to come back for dinner sometime.  Menu looked good."}
{"text":"The mussels were huge and the broth was out of this world! The employees are as terrific as the food and the atmosphere! Menu: Wonderful! Loved it all 
Employees:  Engaging, enthusiastic, friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we had a nice experience. Atmosphere:  Cozy, warm, inviting! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I live in the Bay Area right between Napa, San Francisco and Sacramento, so needless to say I am blessed with access to amazing restaurants. While visiting family here in the Phoenix area, we decided to come here for dinner...

All I can say is, this was a great experience.
- Super friendly staff
- Nice but casual atmosphere
- Killer food (I had the baby back ribs and market salad
- Fair prices
- Extensive drink menu

I'm so glad we found this place and look foreword to coming in again next time we visit North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Excellent location. Beautiful outdoor seating area. I tried the fish & chips. Other people in my party ordered the fish tacos & salad. Everything looked great. Would like to go back and try more items on the menu. Food & service was excellent."}
{"text":"Would not recommend. Overpriced, really bad food, and poor service. Stopped in for lunch. 2 sandwiches, 1 salad, 2 beers $65.00. the sandwiches are served on dry/hard baguette bread. not much flavor in the food. Kind of surprising how bad it really was. Zero stars."}
{"text":"Cool place with nice ambiance. I came here for lunch with my boyfriend: fish tacos were ok and his shrimp po' boy was good. The side salads were too sweet in their dressing and only one type of green. Service was a little helicoptery...it's nice that you are trying to make sure we have a good experience, but not when it is interrupting our conversation over and over. The manager came over twice to ask us how things were...on top of the waitress having already done it after every single item that came to the table."}
{"text":"Delightful place to meet friends with indoor and outdoor seating and comfortable ambience. A varied menu with something for everybody. Professional, personable and expedient staff to help you to have an enjoyable time. This would be a fun place to visit often."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a night out! 

My girlfriend and I came by here since we were new to town. We both sat down at the both a were served right away by Gary. He was very friendly and genuine and we loved his service and getting to talk to him. 

The prices were a tad bit steep but it well worth it. I bought the MSK old fashioned which was perfect (served with Bookers Bourbon)."}
{"text":"One of the BEST Thanksgiving meals dining out I have ever had!!! Highly recommended. Restaurant is impeccable. Service top notch. Food is fresh, and tasty. Thank you for bringing  a great restaurant to DC Ranch!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!! Green Chili Pork - amazing! Plus the best burger in town! Great service !!!"}
{"text":"Great selection. Superb service. Comfortable at home feeling inside or out. Caring and engaged owner who makes you feel part of the family. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese I have EVER had!  Can't wait to come back. Oh, the service was amazing"}
{"text":"Horrible meal. This was the final straw. Ordered the steak frite medium rare. It arrived overdone. Sent it back. Came back rare/bloody. The big issue though was how bad the cut of meat was-all gristle. Felt totally ripped off. When we spoke to the server, she stated that everyone loves it. Will not go back-very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with co-workers and the food is good. Our table had some hair on it we found after we sat down so we wondered how clean everything was but we stayed to eat anyway. I had the trout which is very plain but tasty, mild lemony flavor with small flecks of almond, nice crunchy green beans and wild rice. One of my co-workers had the penne bolognese which he liked another had the chicken wrap and she said it was just okay and other had turkey, brie sandwich and the turkey looked very dried out but she said it was edible. I am fussy about my coffee since I drink it black so I can say the coffee was good. Would I return; probably not."}
{"text":"Bland, forgettable, unseasoned food. Cool ambiance. Go to the wine bar across the street instead!"}
{"text":"Recently moved here and this place is fantastic. The bartender has the Pomegranate Cosmo perfected. Paul the owner is the nicest guy and very \"hands-on\". Visited the night before Mother's Day with my sons, the \"Special\" Prime Rib was delicious. Our server nicknamed Q was the best. Can't wait to go back . You will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the fish and chips, dry and even the fries weren't good. My wife had the fish tacos,  very disappointing!
Desert wasn't great ether, we live locally,  but won't be back :("}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable experience! Brought friends who had never been there--they were very pleased as well. Service is excellent & friendly. Interesting wines...not overpriced. Quality of food & prep was spot on!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. Came for brunch on a Saturday as my family and I were exploring DC ranch and ran into this spot on Market street. The place wants busy so we had our choice of a seat and decided to sit on the patio. There was live music across the street at another restaurant that you could hear which was nice. 

Portions were a nice size and everything seemed fresh and prepared with care. We ordered the grilled fish tacos and they were small but delightful. There were 3 so we fought over the third one and ended up splitting it. My husband's omelet was flavorful and my daughter's eggs off the children's menu came with tater tots. I ordered the BLT, which came with perfectly crispy bacon and the sriracha mayo added a unique twist. My dish came with a side of fresh greens with a light Dijon flavored vinaigrette. 

Service was great and the owner or manager made sure to stop by our table and chit chat with us. Enjoyable experience."}
