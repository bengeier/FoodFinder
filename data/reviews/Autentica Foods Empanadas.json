{"text":"I bought a few things to sample when I visited at lunch time,  a Churrasco - steak sandwich made with fresh baked bun, topped with white cheese, avocado and mayo,   and a Churro filled with dulce de leche for dessert.   To go (yeah wasn't going to leave empty handed lol) a  Beef Empanada and Apple Strudel   Here are my thoughts.   Churrasco sandwich - I enjoyed the fresh bun and avocado, steak was ok not best cut, the topping of cheese and Mayo is a bit rich!   Lighter next time.   Churro filled with dulce de leche was splendid. I was beaming after eating this one. Fried dough and caramel never tasted so good.   Beef Empandada - filling of ground beef and onions a bit too salty. Eats like a meal though. It's the size of two fists.  Apple Strudel. Ive had much better. Kind of dry needs more apple sauce filling.    The bakery is accessible through the food court or via a separate entrance at the back.   There are seats along the counter for dining in."}
{"text":"Love the churrasco which is veal with avocado, melted cheese and mayo and I top it off with the salsa they make themselves. I'm not good with spicy but that one is just enough to give it even better flavour and a bit of a spicy taste.   You can also ask for a small amount in a container to go so that you don't have to commit to the salsa if you don't like it.  Pricing is a bit on the high side for me but the same burger at any fast food restaurant might be about the same because of the avocado. $8+   The empanadas are good here also, going for about $2.95 each which you definite should try with the salsa"}
{"text":"They are known for the empanadas, and when I had the chance to enjoy a jalapeno and beef one, I can understand.    I also ordered an humita, and it was nothing compared to the Ecuadoran place.."}
{"text":"Didn't expect to enjoy the fries more than the sandwich. Guess that's the way life goes sometimes.  Not bad, not great. I'd say worth a try."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for a short time as I saw a sign while driving up finch ave. Finally had the time to stop in w my niece and partner. Was quite surprised really. Its not just one restaurant. Its located in a little mall type plaza, with a number of Latin markets and restaurants. I was quite disappointing that I didn't know of this place earlier and wanted to try so many different foods. Parking lot was full, but luckily someone was pulling out right in front as we were turning in so we got a spot right away. There is lots of parking as its a huge lot.  This specific place is located in the back of the mall food court area and has its own restaurant style seating. While the other places are set up cafeteria/food court style. As soon as we walked in we were greeted w a beautiful aroma of smells and fresh bread yum The owner came right up and asked how we were if if we needed time w the menu, she knew it was our first time clearly looking like lost dogs lol My bf was starving but my niece and I just wanted something to munch on. So he got the chicken sandwich( made w chicken breast) on a fresh in house made burger bun type style bread. The bun was super soft and tasty he inhaled that sandwich lol. It came w lettuce tomatoes cheese and mayo I believe. We also got 2 empanadas each; seafood, chicken,spinach and beef. They were all great and full of flavor. My niece especially loved the beef and I was obsessed with the seafood one. We will definitely be back next time we are in the area to try something else. I also got a pastry called Mantecados. Was really light w some icing sugar on top. Tasted like a sugar cookie but not as sweet."}
