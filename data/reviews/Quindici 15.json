{"text":"Great restaurant in Little Italy wonderful ambiance and Great food. This is our second time her and we will be back!"}
{"text":"J'ai mangé au Quindici en novembre 2017 et j'ai beaucoup aimé tous les plats. Nous avons reçu tous les plats de la table d'hôte du soir pour notre repas. Nous avons commencé avec le tartare de thon rouge et la salade di mamma (salade César décomposée). Les deux entrées étaient excellentes, normalement je n'aime pas trop le tartare de thon mais celui-ci était parfait. 

Ensuite, nous avons mangé : les pâtes sauce à la crème avec champignons et filet de porc, la bajoue de boeuf braisé et le filet de dorage pôelé. J'ai adoré tous les plats, surtout la bajoue de boeuf, que je n'avais jamais mangé avant, qui était divine. Pour le dessert, nous avons mangé un cannelloni déconstruit, qui lui aussi était excellent. 

En tout et partout, ce fût un excellent repas au Quindici, rempli de délicieux plats italiens. Nous avons très bien mangé, même trop ! Une des forces du Quindici, c'est la quantité de nourriture qu'ils vous servent. Les portions sont très généreuses, donc vous ne risquez pas d'arriver à la maison et avoir encore faim. Cela étant dit, la qualité de la nourriture n'est pas affecté par cela, comme c'est parfois le cas dans d'autres établissements. Si vous êtes à la recherche d'un bon restaurant italien, dans un beau décor moderne, Quindici saura vous plaire.

The bread, fresh out of the oven, with olive oil was already a great start, and then I had the foie gras ravioli, which was absolutely exquisite! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was staying in the area and I went for a walk to find a place for dinner. I came upon this restaurant as their outside dining area called to me. It was a lovely evening and it didn't seem overly crowded or rowdy. I came inside the restaurant to ask for a table. The inside of the restaurant is gorgeous as well. 

I was given attitude the entire time which I totally expected, it's Montreal. They pretended they couldn't speak English and if you aren't a native Montreal citizen, they try to give you the old 'well you have less than an hour' (the kitchen closes, we have another reservation, insert stupid excuse here). 

It was 8 pm and they close at 10. They tried to tell me they stop serving at 9. Fine, whatever, it's just me and I can order everything at the beginning. Well another couple came after me, nearly 8:45 and they were treated very graciously. Massive eyeroll. 

I ordered the salmon and then got the cookies and cream dessert. The salmon was outstanding, cooked perfectly and the strawberry \"salsa\" on top was exquisite. The flavors were rich and harmonious. The dessert was plain decadent. I certainly enjoyed the food but be prepared for snarky service"}
{"text":"I went there and had a evening table d'hote! 
First let me start by saying this place is gorgeous and they have a nice terasse! 
I started with a salmon gravlax salad then I had the lamb as a main course. Everything was really good! The lamb was oustanding! Moist and well marinated. The portions were fair and I find the menu inventive! I would go back for sure. I really enjoyed the service, the waitress was attentive and really nice. 
This place is a hidden gem in little Italy."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I had lunch at Pizza Napoletana and as I was returning home I passed in front of Quindici amd I took a note to come here. So last night I actually came and I was so happy that I did. First of all in the summer time they are open during Sundays. It's located on a quiet street and have a beautiful terrasse. 

They have their à la carte menu as well as a table d'hôte during the evening. They have a few selection of each type of food, like two types of pasta, two types of fish, two types of pizza and so on. 

They start you off with warm ciabatta beard with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. They have a great wine menu but also have a full bar, so you can order what you like. I had their red sangria, which was delish. As for appetizer I had the grilled calamar on a bed of hummus and pesto, such a great combination and beautifully plated. 

For the main course I had penne with crispy prosciutto, zucchini, peppers, asiago cheese and white wine sauce. Again great combination, the pasta was cooked perfectly, it just was so satisfying. 

Desert was complimentary and they offered layered crumble chocolate cookie with mascarpone cheese.

I was so happy to come here and it won't be my last visit. Great for a date night, the inside is also very nicely designed."}
{"text":"My wife and I were enjoying a romantic day in Little Italy and wanted a nice place to relax and have a meal in a comfortable setting. The seating and decor are very comfortable, and the waitress was excellent. There is a bit of a retro thing going on with music like the sound track for Goodfellas, and old school table treatments that all were pretty fun. We stopped in at an odd time (2:30) so we had the entire place to ourselves. We were treated well and made to feel very welcome. We both selected the special lunch menu which was a starter, main course, and coffee at the end of the meal. We opted for the gravlax salad. The portions were nice, but the salmon hadn't really been cured long enough, and as a result instead of the cured, balanced flavor gravlax should have, there was a definite battle between sugar and salt in the mouth. Never mind, the salad was a pleasant start. My wife had the penne pasta with a basic Italian ragu which she enjoyed. I chose the pizza which looked great but was soaked with moisture, puddling on the plate. I figured since the place was deserted, it was a little my fault for ordering pizza when their ovens were probably not up to temperature. The ingredients were all good, but the crust in the middle was inedible. 
The one thing that I found irritating was the bill at the end. My wife and I asked for the bill, and the waitress asked if we wanted a coffee drink as it is included in the meal. So we figured, sure, and ordered a latte and an espresso. When the bill arrived, they were an additional cost. It isn't the end of the world, but simply poor business to say something is included and then bill me later, insisting the menu clearly lists it as an add-on. I didn't want a free coffee or even an apology, but I did mention it to the waitress who got really defensive and quite snotty. Luckily my wife was in the restroom so it didn't sour the experience. I would just keep an eye on what they promise and what they actually deliver. For the money, the food was okay. The ambiance is apparently what you pay for here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, we were a party of 6 for a birthday, they're great for groups. I started off with the lobster bisque, WOW what a flavour, nice subtle hint of cognac and lobster broth, delicious, also tried the fried calamari, they were fantastic with a nice spicy aioli. And I got to try the salmon tartar it was also really good, came with sweet potato chips.

As a main I took the chorizo pizza, the chorizo was nice and spicy and the addiction of the rapini and mozzarella with the tomato sauce, perfect mix. I also tried the gnocchi with rose sauce, the gnocchi were light and the sauce had a little hot of spice, amazing.

The real star of this place are there lobster dishes, the risotto with lobster looked incredible someone took it at our table and it looked like a work of art!

The service was impeccable, my only complaint is we kept getting bottle water without asking, at 6 dollars a pop... We ended up with 20 dollars of water lol. That's just a small problem, I would definite come back!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: My first and only experience at Quindici was at for a NYE supper. The table d'hôte menu included a 5-course meal. 

Quindici is located in the heart of Little Italy almost facing the famous \"Milano's\" grocery store. Interestingly, the restaurant was selected for us by newly established in Montreal italian. 
The food was fresh and very good, but stayed within the standard norms of stereotypical italian recipes. There were some slight twists on classic dishes (such as the ravioli stuffed with beef and simmered in a beef reduction sauce). The dishes were served at the perfect temperature and did not have a long wait. 
The service was great. Waiters were respectful and were constantly buzzing to make sure everyone was satisfied. The owner passed around party hats, necklaces and plastic whistles to add to the ambiance.
The decor is very fancy and new. It does not look tacky nor cheap.  There was live music. The bar offers cocktails and has a italian expresso machine. Parking is easy to find in the evening in the area. I cannot comment on the price given that I was attending a NYE event with a fixed price, but I can assume the prices fall into the averages of fine dining restaurants.
In all, Quindici is an upscale italian restarant which caters to an adult clientele 30 yearsold and older and offers a great fine dining experience."}
{"text":"This spot in little Italy is very cozy and chic inside and staff was friendly. Now let's get to the food - some of the portions were exceeding small even by fine dining standards , which was a bit disappointing considering the price of the meal. However, that being said the food was tasty and very well prepared. The braised beef ravioli with fois gras was delicious (just wish there was a tad more of it) and the espresso creme brûlée was a great end to the meal. They also provided a nice suggestion for red wine pairing and some people at our table ordered classic mojitos which were excellent !"}
{"text":"Wow quelle découverte! Tout était simplement parfait. Du service, au décor passant par les plats! Nous étions un groupe d'une dizaine de personnes et nous avons mangé sur la magnifique terrasse. Le menu table d'hôte du midi incluait un choix d'entrée, un choix de repas principal et un espresso. Le prix était plus que raisonnable! J'ai commandé la salade en entrée. Choix déchirant puisque le consommé de volaille avec des boules de parmesan à l'intérieur avait l'air magique. Pour repas principal j'ai commandé des linguini aux palourdes avec une sauce au vin blanc. La salade de l'entrée était superbe. Vraiment fraîche et originalement présentée. Les pâtes étaient encore meilleur!! Bonne portion et la sauce des pâtes était si bonne que j'aurais léché mon assiette (oups)."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and calm ambiance. Staff were very kind. Service was great. Food was great! Filet mignon was very good. Tried the salmon tartare from a friend and it was really good as well. Nice selection of wine. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Belle terrasse, bon service. Table des vins pas très élaborée mais on trouve son compte. Un peu cher.
Nous avons partagé le tartare de maquereaux. Ça manquait de goût . J'ai pris le risotto au homard et lardon qui était très bon. Mon ami a prit la pizza marguarita... bon c'est une pizza rien d'exceptionnel."}
