{"text":"My family and I went here for an early dinner on a Thursday night. Food and service were impeccable. It was our first time here and I was so impressed. We got the California roll and duck wings for appetizers. The wings are as good as everyone says. My husband and I got the chickity China and the twisted classic sandwiches. They were both excellent. The kid's food were great as well. BIG portions for everyone. Only thing that was slightly off was the ambiance... We were the ONLY table in there almost the entire time we were there. It was a little awkward, but it wouldn't stop me from going back. The food is really excellent."}
{"text":"We went here a couple of weeks ago for dinner and while it can get noisy because it's wide open, you can sit on the other side or go outside, weather permitting.  
I had the Rib steak with marinated mushrooms and potato salad.  Everything came out just the way I asked, the potato salad was different with a little zing to it!  I loved everything as did my dinner companions.  Kudos to the chef and all at Twisted.  The wait staff was courteous without hovering, and very accommodating.  I definitely will be going there again and recommending to my friends!"}
{"text":"My wife's $11.50 salad described in the menu below contained 1 strawberry cut in quarters, 5 blueberries and 1 blackberry cut in half. Who but someone trying to con you takes the time to cut a blackberry in half? Fool me once...there won't be a second time. 

CHOCK BERRY
fresh lettuce blend, chock full of fresh blackberries, blueberries, strawberries"}
{"text":"Very interesting menu ...  My husband and I split the sandwiches we ordered ... they both came with chips homemade,, I ordered sweet potato fries AWESOME ..Our son had Sushi that he liked and a side of panko breaded onion rings ...Very good ,,we will go back"}
{"text":"Fabulous food
Amazing cocktails 
Nice and reasonable prices

That's why I'm a fan! Never really cared for sushi until I tried it here. So fresh and prepared in a way that is pleasing to the eye and palate! The cocktails and drinks are made with love:-) and they are always coming out with new ideas.

Once you have dined at Twiisted, you will become a fan, too!"}
{"text":"Just checked this out with my fiance this evening, fantastic! 
They give you edamame when you sit down and with some waters, the edamame has a bit of a kick but it's light and flavorful. 
We split the 8 piece Crab Apple sushi, a deep fried roll filled with avocado, siracha, small apple pieces and crab, full of flavor and not terribly heavy. 
I got The Ogden beer by Goose Island, a Belgian style tripel ale, first time trying this one and definitely won't be my last. My fiance got a glass of riesling which she seemed to like. 
For the main dish she got the Gorgonzilla burger, she said the burger patty was one of the best she's had. Topped with gorgonzolla, saut√©ed onions and tomato, with the bun dusted with some dry ranch seaonsing. Her side was some fantastic crisp chips with some seasoning. 
Onto my burger the reason I decided to write this review, the Brenner, I was told it's probably mix of the words breakfast and dinner. You've probably had a burger with fried egg on it and if you haven't you owe it to yourself to try one, but this one was so different! Underneath the fried egg were tomatoes, scallion and duck bacon, the burger. If that was the entire sandwich it still would have been awesome, but they replace the bun with two Belgian waffles with their hollandaise sauce on them, at the bottom, so it's open-faced! The waffles had just the right amount of syrup in them and they provided the perfect amount of sweetness to complement the \"spiciness\" of the meat. All of the dishes are moderate portions and we weren't overly stuffed. 
Service was great, the restaurant is very open, reasonably priced and they have some TV's above the bar to enhance the experience. 
Definitely check this restaurant out as my fiance said Medina finally has a \"cool hip restaurant! \""}
{"text":"The sushi rolls were great, cocktails were fantastic! Like the edamame to start the meal. Highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped Sat evening around 515. Eating area appeared to be half to two thirds full. A number of empty tables. Were told it would be a 45 min wait. A little strange but we decided to wait. An hour later we were seated. We gave our order immediately upon sitting as we had time to memorize the menu. I ordered the plain burger and my wife a small salad and an app. Couldn't be any easier right?  Took over 45 min to get our food. There appeared to be plenty of wait staff so perhaps short of cooks in the kitchen??? Meal was OK. Nothin special. I won't wait again for average food."}
{"text":"Tasty food, but not enough for a meal.

When I go out to eat, I expect to leave full. You won't see that here. We were seated quickly even though the place was pretty full. The waitress was quick to greet us and let us know about the specials.

The food came in a reasonable time. The taste was ok, but nothing special. There just wasn't much of it. Fifteen minutes after we left, I really wanted to stop somewhere for a bite to eat. And I mean real food, not just an ice cream. 

I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally associate Medina with great sushi and Asian fusion style food, but boy was I wrong. My partner and I had a pretty great experience and would definitely love to come back.

Prices, in my opinion, were pretty reasonable and affordable for what your ordering: creative, inventive, quality sushi. Not to mention, portions are generous. 

We ordered three starters, one sushirito, one roll, and one dessert. We left feeling stuffed!

My favorites were the duck wings, the berryrito, the surf and turf roll, and the lemon berry cake.

The duck wings were sooooo good and tender and the skins crispy. Way better than plain ole chicken wings. There are six sauces you can choose from. We went with the mild Asian BBQ as it was least spicy.

They have what's called sushiritos. They are just what they sound like--sushi in burrito form. These babies are huge!! We ordered the berryrito which had shredded crab, green apple, craisins, and candied walnuts. It was really unique. My only complaints are that I thought it could have used more crab, and a lot less rice. The rice was a little much.

The surf n turf roll was great. The steak was cooked perfectly and there were ample amounts of crab. Oh, and it came with ten pieces instead of the usual six or eight (!!!).

Lastly, dessert. The lemon berry cake was so much better than I was expecting it to be, and I was already expecting it to be pretty good. It had the consistency of pound cake, was topped with powdered sugar, and served with a dollop of whip cream.

Our served was incredibly nice and friendly, super personable. He frequently checked in on us to see how we enjoyed everything. Service started off a bit lackluster. We had to ask for napkins, silverware, and app plates.

The drink descriptions sounded better than the drinks tasted. They seem to be inventive, but they are incredibly imbalanced. I ordered their version of a gin and tonic (gin, tonic, pomegranate juice, club soda) and it literally tasted like straight up gin. I didn't realize I ordered gin on the rocks?!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Loved this place!
Great, modern, well-designed interior.
Inventive menu with ingredients that are not on an average menu and priced fairly.
Sweet potato waffle fries were the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good prices, amazing food and variety to suit anyone. People are great and craft beer selection is solid!"}
{"text":"Twiisted is new in town! But they are now having their \"soft opening\". Their Grand opening will be July 11, 2014. This restaurant used to be the  \"Sushi On The Roll\". I may sound so brutal but then I'm glad there's a new \"sushi\" in town, \"Twiisted Sushi Bar and Grill\". Yup that's right. Sushi and Burgers!
Anyways, why four stars? those stars are only for the restaurant's atmosphere, staff friendliness, service, cleanliness and Timeliness. And we happen to meet the owner there having his dinner too. He's nice and very level headed.
I will only be  reviewing the meal that we've ordered. 

1) Octupus Nigiri and Uni Nigiri - I got 2 pc  of each. Ordering octopus sometimes is a risk because Octopus tend to get tough. And Uni sometimes get that too fishy smell and after taste. I'm impressed, their octopus nigiri is nice soft chewy and Uni nigiri is quite fresh with that slight sweet salty good taste. so this meal-- 4  stars.

2) California Dreamin' --(Crab, avocado, cucumber topped w/ seared salmon, garlic aioli, sweet soy, almonds, scallion - about 8 pcs.) 
I  highly recommend this. It has a yum factor to it. My 12 yr old daughter loved it. Only thing she said she's not crazy about the crushed almonds and I agree. But all in all -- 3 1/2 stars

3) Philadelphia - (Smoked salmon, avocado, cream cheese. - about 8 pcs.) Something about too much cream cheese always throws me away though. I guess if you don't want to taste the fish at all on your sushi rolls might as well order a vegetarian or ask if meat substitute is available. Not crazy about this one seems like I'm just eating cream cheese. But I recommend it for first timers. ;-)  3 stars

4) Twiisted Classic Burger -(Cheddar, duck bacon, pickled onion, lettuce, tomato, spicy aioli on a brioche bun).  The bun, meat patty, cheddar, lettuce & tomato are excellent, but the spicy aioli with the pickled onion and duck bacon over powered the whole thing.  My advice: if you are really looking for a \"classic\" burger taste, skip the duck bacon and ask them to go very light on he pickled onion.  It's a great burger.  3 1/2 stars 

5) French Fries -- \"The French Fries\" may I say. This alone is a meal already. It's light, soft and fluffy inside and light crisp on the outside and when dipped with their own homemade ketchup with a hint of ginger and a secret ingredient this fries just     melts in your mouth. Now imagine that! ;-) Funny thing I have to rate this -- 4 stars!

6) Chocolate Mousse- topped with light whipped cream and sliced strawberries and with a hint of spice. Yes I said spice as in a chili spice. I totally forgot what was the said spice they used but definitely worth a try. This is one of those desserts that tickles your palate. I like it! -- 3 stars

7) Edamame-- And I should not forget  that complementary Edamame! Sprinkled with their special salt and crushed dried chili pepper.  Lovely! -- 3 stars

Over all I really do enjoy dining at Twiisted Sushi Bar and Grill and Yeah finally something new and good and diverse in Medina, OH.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! Love the sushi nights!!! It's a great way to try all the different Sushi they have! They give you complementary edamame! The staff is friendly and the place is really clean!"}
{"text":"Great place and great people. We have never had a less than awesome time at twisted, from there fun craft beer events, patio and sushi bar defiantly something on the menu to please the whole family."}
{"text":"Despite the best efforts of our pleasant but harried server our evening meal for my family of six was disappointingly slow and simply unacceptable. 3 ordered from the sushi menu and 3 from the traditional kitchen with the problem apparently coming from the sushi area. 50 minutes from order to food arrival, it went from frustrating to embarrassing to sad. We were given token potato chips chips to stave off the hunger and were visited by the GM - earnest and hardworking both but in the end 50 minutes is 50 minutes. To an outsider to the industry it appears that the meshing of two different food preparation areas (sushi and traditional kitchen) was not going well on a Wednesday night. Food? Burgers were acceptable but several in the party had lost their appetite and those who had not atypically left food on the table. We are not sushi experts but it is apparent even to us that if you love good sushi, don't go to Twiisted. The Surf and Turf's beef was distasteful and rubbery and the Tuna Tartare was slathered with a sauce so sweet it appeared to be hiding something. I lost track of the last order of sushi. Ambiance was compelling and created interest. Pricing was quite high for the value received - even after the token discount the GM took off the bill (he offered, we did not ask - interpret that as you will). Twiisted: I want you to be successful and I am pulling for you but please please take heed, you must take steps to correct the food delivery - fewer tables or revise your coordination plan or reduce your menu - I cannot tell you what to do, I just implore you to do something"}
{"text":"Twisted is one of the best restaurants in town, they get extra points for creating a delicious and inventive semi-fusion menu, which is rather courageous in the somewhat sleepy town of Medina. They have a great drink menu which changes frequently. One of my favorites was a \"ghost\" drink they had around Halloween, I won't tell you how many of them I had, just know that I went stumbling home. 
I only knocked off a point due to not *quite* getting the spice level right. My spouse's sushi was off the charts hot, to the point where it was almost unenjoyable. Meanwhile, I ordered a spicy burger and was disappointed that the heat level was barely mild."}
{"text":"The staff was beyond friendly and knowledgeable, even making several recommendations.

The sushi was phenomenal! Great prices, great choices (both traditional and outside the box), & phenomenal quality.

The entrees and sandwiches arrived piping hot. Its not too often you see that at a restaurant.  The flavors and quality of ingredients was absolutely amazing. We have been wanting to try Twiisted for the longest times, and after this experience, we will most definitely be back.

Prices were most definitely reasonable. 3 sushi rolls, 2 entrees, & dessert for less than $75.

THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be writing a bad review about this place. This was my favorite place to eat until today.  After waiting nearly 15 minutes to be able to put in our order, my wife and I were left for 45 minutes without a return visit to our table. No one came back to refill our drinks or to explain why our food was taking so long to be brought out.  When we were finally able to flag someone down, who then went to find our waitress, we were told that there was some sort of mixup in the kitchen, but at that point we didn't care. This is unacceptably poor communication and poor service for a Thursday, in the early evening, with the place less than half full. It makes me sad that I had to walk out of my favorite restaurant without being served and that now I will have to think twice about going there again."}
{"text":"Great burger: toasted bun, thick cheese and bacon, FAT burger and tasty fries. Great American burger joint!"}
{"text":"We have been her several times and have never had a bad meal.  Service is always spot on and very friendly and knowledgeable.  We love the \"twist\" they put on everything and it's not the same old bar food.  Will go back again without a doubt.

One thing about the person complaining about the parking and decor.  I really don't think it's a big deal to park at the bank across the street and walk a few extra feet.  And the decor is fine, what are you an interior decorator?  Sometimes people have to make their reviews sound like they are a professional reviewer and love to comment on every single aspect they can think of.  Some of the best places we have ever ate at are dive bars with parking on the street away from the restaurant.  Get over it."}
{"text":"After eating pizza and salad across the street 2 times a week I decided to give this place a try. All I can say is OMG! Delicious! Amazing! It's hard to believe this place was sitting right under my nose this whole time! Simply put.. \"Its the hidden treasure of Medina!\" It's just off North Court St behind 1st Merit bank. After eating plain food across the street twice every week my taste buds thanked me! Try it! Your taste buds with thank you to!"}
{"text":"A group of chefs created this fusion of american comfort food and traditional Japanese cuisine.  Inspired, delicious meals including an extensive list of specialty sushi rolls and gourmet burger combinations.  There is something for everyone with a discerning palate.  I eat here frequently.  Favorites include the California dream roll, vive la burger and slamon blt.  Bread puddings are my favorites desserts."}
{"text":"Ingredients are always fresh and delicious!   Love the atmosphere and prompt,  polite service!  Great place to go for anything from a burger to sushi! Love the edamame served as opposed to bread!"}
{"text":"Great variety on the menu & everything we've tried has been very tasty. Servers have mostly been very good, a couple have been a little lacking."}
{"text":"My husband loves sushi and I love a good burger.  We were both pleased with our meals.  I especially loved the way the french fries are prepared.  Light and crispy and not greasy.  Server was excellent and attentive.  Food arrived in a timely manner and edamame freebie was terrific.  Will definitely be returning to sit on the patio soon."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner at Twiisted for the first time. It was a Monday night and we were seated immediately. Complementary edamame was a nice touch. My entire table ordered sushi and we were all very pleased. The crazy cali roll was a table favorite and I personally enjoyed the volcano roll. I eat sushi frequently and this was a clear cut above the rest. Our server was also excellent in explaining the menu, making suggestions, and keeping our drinks full. I will be going back to Twiisted soon. The burger selection on the menu looked amazing and I will be sampling one of those in my next visit. I live almost an hour from the restaurant but it was completely worth the drive! If you haven't been there, you really should check this place out!"}
{"text":"Our server was fantastic--upbeat, helpful, and on point even with helping with the kiddos."}
{"text":"There selection of food is amazing. They have American to Japanese. Overall the food was good and the service was amazing."}
{"text":"My son and I came here last night for dinner. We were in town for a soccer tournament and my son was in the mood for some sushi. As soon as we entered we were greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us right away. As soon as we sat down at our table our server, Ashley,  greeted us and told us she would be right with us. We looked through the menu, I went right to the sushi section since I knew that's what we were leaning towards. The descriptions were helpful as well as the spiciness ratings for the different types of maki and sushi. We ended up getting an appetizer, the goon dip, it wasn't from the sushi section but  it was really good. The serving size was very generous,  since there we're only two of us we couldn't finish it all. Next we ordered the Volcano and Hawaiian rolls. It was delicious, we shared the two, but my favorite was the Volcano. Spicy but not overpowering so you could taste all the flavors. The Hawaiian was sweet and spicy and the pineapple worked so well with the shrimp tempura and jalapeno.  Our server Ashley was super awesome, she was attentive and friendly and she even offered us a coupon for our next visit. I declined because we are from out of town and I didn't want it to be wasted on us, but if we lived locally we would most certainly return and bring my husband and daughter along. All in all a fun interesting spin on traditional sushi, the combinations were tasty and interesting and service was great. The restaurant had a relaxed atmosphere and the decor was clean and modern."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Medina. If you love burgers you must order their burger/pulled pork combo. Awesome! And the service is great. If you are lucky and Sarah is serving try and get her section, she always lets us know about new items to try and has never disappointed with her recommendations."}
{"text":"Really good unique food. Lots of choices. I'm not a fan of raw fish but there are many other options. The duck wings were great and they have many choices in sauces. Service was really good as well."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I love how unique their food is. The staff is awesome and professional. I've gotten complementary food even when I felt I didn't really need it to be complementary- they will take care of you"}
{"text":"fantastic!! lauren was phenomenal with a big party of 14..,,,,definately will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh first impressions. It's really a nice place esthetically....
We went there today on a whim. It was dead. Maybe 10 tables -- tops. ??
I ordered the Shroomin burger. Asked if they could wrap it in leaf lettuce bcuz I do Keto. Asked for veggies. Got an upcharge on those. They cooked it perfect. 
However our food took twice as long to get as other tables that were seated after us. Don't know why ????
No apology or anytg. 
The waiter seemed new. Or he just wasn't very social. Which won't work in that industry. 
After about a 45 min wait for my burger and her sushi (only 2 of us dining). 
My burger arrived. It had NO mushrooms. Lol
So, my Shroomin burger was not Shroomin. Lol

I told the waiter about it. 
Adam --the manager on duty neither came and addressed me nor apologized. As a matter of fact I had to ask the waiter what was being done. And got told they would just charge me for a plain burger. (But I wanted my Mushrooms!!!). That's why I ordered that particular burger. 
I guess after owning my own cafe I expect a tad more. Especially out of a more upscale place such as this. All they did was simply charge me for a lesser burger and didn't even take off for the veggies. Which I thought was in bad taste. (No pun intended) 

It was quite disappointing. Because I was really pysched to go there. 
With it not being busy at all--- I just thought it could of been handled better. Well, really at any time it could have. 

So all in all. Idk. I expected more. But don't wanna act like a 2 year old. I just expected a bit more out of them. They have built up quite a following and report out there and the didn't live up to the hype. 
Bad form Adam. Just calling you out !! I was in the customer service industry for almost 20 years and had a cafe. I treated the customer like gold bcuz they were paying my bills!!
Gotta get better at addressing issues my friend."}
{"text":"You should be able to give 0 stars when you barely make the 15 min drive home before your throwing up. Nothing else to say, I will NEVER eat sushi or anything here ever again."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Ordered the shrimp explosions for starters and I was blown away by how good it was. Then tried the sushi and again it was out of this world! Crab Apple was my favorite."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Only word needed. Sushi is different inventive and oh so tasty. Would definitely be back if i lived I. The area. Chef is from Australia and is super friendly"}
{"text":"Diverse menu: salads, sandwiches, burgers, entrees, and a good range of sushi. Perfect choice tonight because I love sushi, but my mum doesn't.

My mum got the Luigi chicken sandwich with roasted sweet potatoes, and had to take half of everything home, because the portions are quite generous.

Extra points because they tore down a station to make my GF tuna bowl as safe as possible from any gluten cross-contamination, and no one showed me any annoyance about it. They didn't have a GF sauce, but I expect that, and always carry Tamari packets with me.

If you like peanut butter and bananas, I *highly* recommend the \"Hunk O' Love\" dessert sushi. The rice cuts the sweetness a bit, so it's not overwhelmingly sugary. Superbly yum!

April was our server. She was very patient and helpful with my plethora of gluten-free questions (some items are inherently GF; some have to be changed a little to be GF), and didn't mind verifying with the kitchen on some points. She was also extremely attentive to our drinks, empty dishes, etc., but not at all obtrusive.

We were told the menu gets a few changes every season, so we're looking forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"It's always nice to try a new place that you never been to. Best service best food great staff I will for sure have to keep this place in mine. 

If you plan to visit twisted be sure to do it on a  slow not so busy night."}
{"text":"The service was great, and the sushi delicious. I hope they can thrive in this market."}
{"text":"Love this place. I ha e been here a few times and it never disappoints. Highly recommended and i will be back"}
{"text":"Apparently others have really enjoyed their visits here. We did not. In fact, Danielle felt sick the entire ride home and then promptly vomited as soon as she walked into the house.

we each picked at a plate of sushi that included Spicy Crab, Tempura Shrimp and Yellowtail. Apparently Yellowtail at Twiisted is served not pink but nearly gray. The shimp seemed fine but the crab was covered with so much extra spicy mayo that it was all you could taste.

i also ordered a cheesesteak sandwich that would have been fine if not for the overwhelming amount of gritty cheese sauce on it. 

lastly, i think our server was mute. he checked in on us from time to time but barely spoke loud enough to comprehend anything he said.

i'd been fighting Danielle about going there for a long time. now i never have to bother with it again because she'll never go back. Neither will I. i'm glad others have had better experieinces, though. we're done."}
{"text":"It was pretty decent, tho over-priced. 

We had 2 people keeping us stocked with drinks for our party of six. 


Its nice to see a place that has their shit together and tries to do some different things."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here a couple of times now and have not been disappointed. The twiisted roll is by far my favorite followed by the California dreamin. My wife and I also had the opportunity to dine in here and had a great time. The entire restraint is clean, new, and has a perfect amount of excitement. Tv are all around the huge bar. Sushi bar is well layed out and away from the noise of the bar so it feels like it's its own place. We had multiple sushi rolls and the appetizer sampler. The sampler gave us a great idea of everything Twiisted has to offer. The BBQ duck wings were delicious. Anyone who enjoys sushi, and a few good drinks should come here if they have the chance. Check on their Facebook for daily specials! Endless sushi every Monday night!"}
{"text":"The two star review is being very generous. I went to TWIISTED the first week it opened. I expected there to be a lot of people there so I was not surprised that there was a long wait. But when we sat down, the tables were crammed very close to one another. This made the entire meal uncomfortable. The waitress apologized for not coming over sooner and told us that they were understaffed and it caused a lot of stress on them. The food finally came after a 45 minute wait. The wait was definitely definitely not worth it. I felt sick the rest of the night from the food. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent..  Crispy Crab burger, Zombie roll & Chazmanian Devil roll..  We were en route to Cleveland for a concert, found this place and everything was delicious..  We will definitely be back if in the area again or we just might have to make a special trip"}
{"text":"Visited here with my sister & BIL who frequent this spot. Interesting concept with burgers & sushi, which is good if you are going with someone who doesn't care for sushi. Fortunately, our group is all \"pro-sushi.\" The service was great (that alone would be a 5)- it was nice the server explained the concept well & even shared that most rolls can be altered with things added or removed. Most places that isn't an option. 
We dined during happy hour (til 6 I think) so all classic sushi is $5, with several app & drink specials. We got 5-6 of the classic rolls & one speciality- the Cali Chaz I think? Everything was good & came out quickly. Not the best sushi I've ever had, at all. But still good & rolls were good sized. My rating is based on regular prices, Bc if I was paying full price I would have been disappointed. However, for happy hour a great deal, especially for the size of rolls (some other spots tend to make them tiny to account for discounted price) & it didn't seem that they did that. Would visit again for happy hour."}
{"text":"Best happy hour menu 7 days a week! I just moved from California, an was worried I wouldn't be able to have sushi here. I LOVE that I have it right down the street!"}
{"text":"Poor service and below average food. Not sure if the server was new but place was not busy so the amount of confusion and poor service was sad. She couldn't get one beer order correct and messed up easy burger orders. Burgers were nothing to go back for, over priced Wendy's which I would have rather had."}
{"text":"What a fun place when you're in the mood for about anything!  I had the goat cheese hamburger and my husband got sushi.  We shared and had the best of both worlds!  Sushi was pretty darn good too.  Thought it was going to be a little more formal, but good atmosphere. We will be back."}
{"text":"The freshest sushi in NEO.  Also got the Brenner burger which pretty much changed my life.  

Highly recommend to anyone who loves sushi or burgers or BOTH!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on Valentine's day alone because I'm traveling for work, somewhat awkward but what can I do. The staff was overly nice to me about it, thanks guys.

Sat at the bar, very good service. Quality beer recommendation. 

I got the classic burger on recommendation as well. Fantastic burger. You know when there's bacon on a burger and it's really thick and chewy and hard to bite through? Okay imagine the opposite of that. Thin, crispy, perfect crunch to complement the soft meat and bun. Super satisfying and delicious. I got medium rare, should have asked for medium, but that's my bad they did a good job of it. 

Subbed edamame for fries. They're both listed as the same price range of side, but they charge $1.50 for the change. Whatever. 

Didn't even get to the sushi aspect of this restaurant, very interested. If I'm ever in town again I'll come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Monday happy hour special - all you can eat sushi for $14.99. Rolls are from a selected list that you can get for $5/ea any happy hour during the week. You start with 2 rolls and then reorder 1 at a time. Initially food came out slow as whole table ordered sushi but staff made sure to get subsequent orders in so we wouldn't have to wait. Drink specials are rather steep in price for happy hour but sushi was tasty and fresh. 

Be aware that there are no changing tables on site in either bathroom."}
{"text":"Love the goon dip and the sushi.  The bugers r good.  Love the mac and cheese burger."}
{"text":"Went for fish Friday specials
Crabby patties and perch poboy excellent
Drinks a little on the weak side but good"}
{"text":"Fun choices! The Rangoon dip was delicious, not as cream cheese tasting as an actual crab Rangoon, which is great! The grape escape cocktail tasted like a grape candy. My husband and I had sushi, the spicy Hawaiian roll (eh, ok but not great), heartland roll (the best of all three, tastes savory), and some other that I don't remember that was good. I liked that my 3 year old could get corn dogs while we had sushi lol. Her chips that came with her meal were actually pretty yummy too. A bit under staffed so the wait time for food was slightly longer."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi, great service and good vibes. I will say the space was a little big and clunky for a sushi restaurant, but overall wonderful."}
{"text":"The 'Goon Dip was just ok. I did however like the Wonton chips. The dip itself is overrated; too much cream, fake crab meat. I got sick and tired of the dip rather quickly... The discounted Happy Hour is fantastic, a great deal and well worth it. I would never pay full price for the food. The sushi was subpar at best and I felt was flavorless and just not very enticing... Bottom line is, don't come here for The sushi. The burgers are the best thing they offer hands down."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Had a work meeting there and we really enjoyed ourselves. Service was superb and the food was out of this world! Definitely going back! Highly recommend for a great dinner and the bar area is huge!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved Twiisted!  Now my husband can join my kids and I when we go for sushi.  He raved about his burger and said it was one of best he's ever had.  My crab rangoon sushi rocked!!  Very happy and excited to return!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad dish or anything here. Today, I had the nacho appetizer which was awesome. Then the twisted burger was very good. Most food even nachos have an Asian twist like soy sauce or something but very good and flavorful foods on the menu."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Medina. I appreciate that I can bring my parents here, and have sushi while they get a burger.

I really love the unique appetizers, like the crab rangoon dip and the philly egg rolls (reasonably priced, too). The duck burger was a nice surprise. Had the new-style salmon sashimi tonight, which pretty much blew me away. It was lightly seared and presented in a ponzu sauce. Pretty darn generous portion, too... It was five fairly large slices of salmon!

I liked the previous place, Sushi on the Roll, but it had a some issues (which they've addressed with this new place)... Luckily, they took the best house roll, the Chaz roll, and kept it on their menu. Happy to see this restaurant really take off! Looking forward to them being open for lunch (I think they said this fall)."}
{"text":"The ambiance is very good, however, in the dining area around the bar, the glass windows around the wooden doors to an auxilary room are visible.  I found this to be an issue because you can clearly see unsightly steel shelving and cleaning material.  Perhaps these windows can be tinted black in the future?  I was told that the room was being renovated, but maybe they could put a curtain up until it is done?

I thought it was a very nice touch to provide complimentary Edamame, which is normally a cost item wherever else you go.

I had the Brenner and a side of Twisted Mac and Cheese, both of which were excellent.  The Brenner is a sweet and savory mix between a burger, eggs benedict and a waffle with syrup, which I learned from Rich (I mention him later) is a sweetened reduction of the Left Hand Stout.  Very innovative combination.  The Twisted Mac and cheese is a must-get!  It had goat cheese and a garnish of duck bacon.  Wonderful!

As far as dessert, I had the Root Beer creme brulee.  It was a little on the dense side and I wasn't a fan.  I told the waitress, Miranda, who, by the way, was great and very attentive.  She promptly told Rich, the kitchen manager about the creme brulee, and he came right out to speak with me.  Really great guy.  He was very open to hearing about my experience and very welcoming.

Overall, great experience.  Hit this place up!"}
{"text":"So far so good the egg roll of the month corned beef and cabbage delicious!  Just wish there was thousand island dressing to dip them in!  Decent beer selection! Nice atmosphere!   I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is so unique and it's some of the best creations we've ever had. It should be packed in there at all times."}
{"text":"Went tonight I think it's about our fifth time. What can I say, everything is beyond what you would expect from the description. Had a burger for the first time and the house made wheat brioche bun was amazing. Maple bacon and truffle mayo sent it right over the top. The burger itself was like butter. If u haven't been yet do yourself a favor and go asap. Weekdays 3-6 drink and food specials."}
{"text":"Tried Twisted today for lunch. This is not your typical sushi place.  We ordered potstickers, a rainbow roll and a romantic roll. Everything was fantastic. Very fresh and great taste. I missed having green tea available to me. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place has the best appetizers in Medina! The 'goon dip is amazing.
My sister and I split the sandwich \"Sammy the angry crab\" and we both loved it.
They have a great happy hour too."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, very eclectic menu choices. I tried the duck burger and the duck bacon, it was good but I prefer a real burger and the bacon was more like jerky than bacon.  The sushi is good here, and I love the spicy edemame beans instead of bread and butter.  With the talk ceilings it was very loud, the manager said they were going to install curtains to help absorb some of the echoes.  I really think they need to install some sound absorbing foam tiles on the ceiling."}
{"text":"After being enticed by a burger sushi concept we decided to stop in for lunch. The restaurant is very large, plenty of seating and a nice large bar area. Semi open kitchen to watch the sushi chefs at work. The decor is nice and the staff is very freindly. 

To start we ordered the duck wings, they were crispy and the duck was nice and tender. We ordered all the sauces on the side so we could try them all. Their house made bbq, sweet chili and buffalo sauce were all really good, that buffalo sauce was hot! Also tried the poke salad (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avacodo, ponzu sauce, scallion and toasted sesame seeds). The fish was very fresh and the the flavor from the ponzu sauce was amazing. We had to try the sushi so we orderd the Dirty 330 roll (shrimp tempura, tuna, avacodo, asparagus, spicy crab, yellowtail, scallion, spicy mayo and eel sauce). Simply spectacular! The fish was fresh, the rice cooked perfectly and the combo of sweet and spicy from the sauces topped the dish off. We also got the seaweed salad and it was delicious. 

For our entrees my wife orderd the chock berry salad with grilled salmon. Everything from the lettuce to the berries were fresh and fantastic. And the salmon was cooked to perfection. For myself I ordered the mac attack burger (creamy mac n cheese, crispy onion straws, crumbled bacon on ciabatta). The burger was cooked perfectly, I love that the burger was cooked on a char broiler, I think it gives it another layer of flavor. The only things I thought was off was the mac n cheese was a little bland and the ciabatta bun did not hold up. For my side I ordered the rosemary sea salt fries. The fries were soggy and did not taste of any rosemary or sea salt. Overall great menu and great experience."}
{"text":"Wow!! We were in town for a soccer tournament, and had a 3 hour break between games and needed lunch. Searching dining in the area was monotonous with choices very similar to each other. Then we scrolled to this fine option. 

Burgers AND sushi?? Why isn't this a more common theme?!? The interior and design was perfect, the craft beer selections exceeded my expectations, and the enormous menu was mouth-watering. A top-notch waitress (Thanks Rachel!) was prompt, knowledgeable, and helpful when it came to deciding our sushi roll choices.

Sweet Baby James was the homerun! I'd recommend it to any sushi fan on the fence. The nigiri were HUGE and well worth the minimal cost.

Chris (operator) was firing the rolls and sushi off the line in no time, and personally delivered those items to us. He came with a smile, some conversation, and an impression for his creation that won't be forgotten any time soon.

YOU MUST VISIT THIS PLACE!! Their menu will feed anyone with any appetite!"}
{"text":"Took forever to be greeted, get our drinks and get our lunch. Moderate crowd at best. Somber attitude from all the staff. Sushi had extra rice- not a good value. Want to love it since it is nearby- but unfortunately with this kind of service I will never pay $74 for a lunch here again. All the patrons looked frustrated as well. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and great burgers. The menu selections are very creative,
I had the Peking duck burger and a order of the Cali Sushi roll. Both were excellent"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time this weekend. It was 7pm on a Friday night. We were able to walk in and grab a table for 4 in the bar. I was surprised it wasn't nearly as busy as I thought it would be for a Friday night. We started off with a drink and an order of the goon dip & fried mozzarella appetizers. The fried mozzarella appetizer came out with 3 huge fried mozzarella patties (think big hamburger patty size) and marinara dipping sauce. Everyone who tried them loved them! 
The goon dip was great. It was cool when it came out, we had to ask for it to be warmed up, which wasn't a problem. The fried wontons used to dip with were great. 
From there, we ordered spicy tuna roll, It's a Mia Mario burger & a classic burger. We all were supper impressed with the food. We will definitely be back. Can't wait to try so many more menu items!"}
{"text":"Good burgers but beware of the edamame they serve as an appetizer, they literally smell like cow manure. When I raised my concerns of the odor to my waiter he told me that they are supposed to smell that way."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I love the concept of sushi and burgers! The staff was very helpful in making a decision on what to order. The Brenner burger was beyond delicious! I had a side of sweet potato fries which were equally delicious! Overall had a great experience and the food was great! I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Ok, this is my first time here and the food is perfectly prepared, fresh, and the portions are amazing! Rachel was our server and was exactly perfect."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I am rating at 2 stars, not because of the food, but the service. The food at lunch was actually pretty good. I enjoyed Ceviche and had the Salmon BLT. My husband had the Asian Crab Salad, and Spicy Tuna Roll. All very good. The service? Well, it was not at all pleasant. It's one thing if you're a people person, but my goodness he couldn't stop talking. Within the first minute of being seated I wanted to leave. I couldn't even eat due to his need for conversation. This was not small talk. $50.00 later, I'm exhausted. Wish I could come back for the food but I'm too afraid of getting the same server."}
{"text":"Overpriced sushi wasn't worth the money, burgers were okay. I wouldn't spend this much money for frozen tuna and service was kinda slow"}
{"text":"The Embassy are what dreams are made of!!!  So incredibly good!!! My new favorite place!! And it's cool that if your spouse doesn't like sushi they have great burgers to get!!!"}
{"text":"we had a bunch of appetizers!  No sushi and no burgers... The crab Rangoon dip was really interesting... I liked it... The whole thing felt very much like a fancy Taco Bell... It's like very very fun and fancy sushi burgers for midwesterners."}
{"text":"Twiisted gets kudos for:
Yummy and creative sushi options
Delish burgers

I've also tried the short rib with risotto - so creamy, it's melt-in-your-mouth good.

What I love is the combination of foods. There is something to please almost everyone. When the hubs wants sushi and I don't, we head here. I really don't understand why this place is seemingly never busy. It defies explanation. Prices are good and food is awesome. GO TO THIS PLACE! You won't regret it.

Only thing I don't love is that when we've been seated in the bar area...I'm not sure if it's acoustics or maybe music is too quiet...but I. Can overhear conversations from the bar and I feel like I'm eavesdropping! Maybe the bartender is loud. I dunno. It just makes me feel like I'm invading someone's space, so for that I give it 4 stars.

I should of course mention they have crazy good lunch specials and happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"First time here because I'm always on the lookout for new places, especially for sushi. The Twisted Sangria was perfect...not too sweet but good and fruity. I tried the Goon Dip at the recommendation of other Yelpers and it didn't disappoint. The first serving came out barely warm and with a heavy panko topping that IMO overpowered the dip. The server quickly solved that by bringing out a new order minus the panko topping and warmer. My server was excellent. I had their veggie sushi and ordered the Walnut & Fig Salad  to take home. Yummy!"}
{"text":"We live like less than 5 minutes from this place and we finally made it here to try this place. We have heard different stories about this place but we wanted to have our own opinion. The first thing I like was happy hour was over at 6pm during the week. We showed up about 5:50pm and I asked the waitress do we have time to order happy hour specials, she said yes of course. You have until 6:15pm to order those specials. I was like great!  I recommend the pretzels for the appetizer. The dipping sauces were good.We both got sandwiches for our dinner and they both were good also. We did not try the sushi, so can't tell you how that was. The atmosphere I would say is modern and clean. I would go back again."}
{"text":"This place really intrigued me. It's definitely a unique concept. I got a sushi-rito, basically a sushi roll yet burrito style. It was tasty and had a hefty portion of fish.

My only drawback was the speediness of service. Everything took longer than it felt it should. My friends and I (a group of 6) didn't receive our food for almost 45 minutes. Even after that, it took awhile to get the bill, pay the bill, etc. Every part was slow. 

Our server was very nice! We budgeted nearly 2 hours for dinner since we had a movie to go to and that wasn't enough. We could have easily been there another 20 to 30 minutes if we hadn't sped it up near the end. 

Just a fair warning that this will be a 2 hour meal or longer when you go."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in Medina. I love the fact they have sushi and burgers so it makes it easy to go with a big group and there will be something everyone will be able to enjoy. Never had anything bad quality and drinks are top notch."}
{"text":"I don't have any complaints about my experience when visiting Twiisted for my birthday back January. The menu is definitely creative and unique. Service was good. We had the \"not yo average nachos\" and they were a good \"twiist\" on regular nachos. I ordered the \"chickity china\" sandwich and it was very tasty. I really hope to make it to their happy hour sometime as they have some exceptional deals. Nonetheless, I plan on returning very soon."}
{"text":"I was in the area for business and was craving sushi. I ordered the poke salad ($9.50), volcano roll ($12), and a spicy tuna roll ($9).

It took forever to my food, almost half an hour. This was even more excruciating since I was dining alone and the restaurant wasn't even half full. My server came over eventually and apologized, saying that there was some large takeout orders before me. Not sure that makes me feel better, but I guess it wasn't his fault. Either that's poor management or my order was lost. I wished they would have offered a snack or dessert to help with the long wait, but nothing. 

Everything came out all at once. The poke salad was okay but felt like it was missing something. It was pretty bland for poke. I liked that the spicy tuna was an actual chunk of tuna instead of the usual mush, but it wasn't spicy at all. It was literally a tuna roll with a light spicy mayo drizzle. It was also a little heavy on rice. Especially for $9, I was really expecting something special. I'm not much of a soy sauce dunker when I eat sushi, but the tuna needed it. 

Lastly, the volcano roll was interesting. It was mostly shredded imitation crab meat but the craw fish bits on top were good. I enjoyed that roll the most, maybe because the sriracha added a bit of flavor. I wouldn't say it was amazing though. Overall, a slightly disappointing experience mainly because the flavors don't match the price. I'll have to look elsewhere to get my sushi fill."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! My boyfriend and I went there for the first time two weeks ago and we loved everything !!! Food was amazing , staff were friendly , service was fast! We will definitely be going back ! If you haven't tried it yet , you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday... decent selection of sushi rolls for $5 during Happy Hour. I had the \"Crazy Cali\" and \"Philadelphia\".... Both were EXCELLENT! I wasn't in the mood for shrimp, so they substituted the shrimp for crab in the Philadelphia at no extra charge. Also had the \"Goon\" appetizer... I think the chips were better than the dip! Overall, the food was amazing, but I rate it a 4star because our server nice but not very personable."}
{"text":"First time here ordered the cebiche it was bland no taste whatsoever next Cali roll and spider roll. Both were horrible no taste and rice had creamy texture outside and hard as a rock inside. This is the most horrible experience I've ever had needless to say will never ever go back beware if this place"}
{"text":"First time here , came with the family. Nice atmosphere and large menu. But the food didn't taste very good and actually made both me and my mother sick .. We both got large sandwiches and didn't even take more than 2 bites . Service was lacking as well .  Will not be back"}
{"text":"Tonight I visited this restaurant for the third time. It gets better with each visit!!  It was my friends first visit. She loved it!!  We had a little problem with the hostess. We didn't care of the kitchen was busy. We wanted a seat and a drink. The drinks were excellent, and so fairly priced.  Our waitress was very helpful educating us on the excellent sushi choices. We were soo happy with her suggestions. The manager was more than awesome. He overheard us talking about a sticky seat we discovered.  He came to us immediately and took care of the issue. He told us about the duck bacon (which sounded awful to us), and gave us a sample. It looks like a strip of ham and tastes like bacon!!  Very good. The chef came over and told us about his desserts. We opted for creme br√ªl√©e. They were out. Better get the ice cream sundae with his absolutely awesome brownie!,  whew!! Made in his heaven. We will definitely be going back. Love the bar area."}
{"text":"I'm going to leave this as a temporary review given my girlfriend and I only ate from the sushi menu. It was not bad by any means, but wasn't anything to write home about either. I had the Surf and Turf which while somewhat tasty, it lacked texture and felt a little sloppy. My girlfriend had the Dragon roll which was pretty good overall. The let down for her was the Spicy tuna roll. A standard amongst pretty much all sushi places. This one had tuna, siracha, scallion, and spicy mayo..... but no cucumber. It was missing that texture again. Our server was on point though. His name was Josh or Jason and I wish I could remember his name as well as I do his service. Will definitely try it again as the other side of their menu looked really good. Was just a little let down on the sushi."}
{"text":"Don't order the crab cakes! They are 75% breading, with stringy imitation crab meat. I am a crab cake aficionado, and I can almost always find a redeeming quality in any crab cake I have ever ordered. However, I'm not sure if these can be honestly called \"crab cakes\". The server admitted that they used imitation crab meat, but she said they also used a mix of real crab. Imitation crab meat should never enter into the crab cake recipe, and if so, it should state that on the menu. They tasted like corn fritters. It's no wonder they serve them with hot sauce, because otherwise they would lack any flavor beyond the \"corn dog breading\". The burger was decent, and the service was great. They noticed that I only took one bite of the crab cake and pushed it to the side, and were very courteous and helpful in removing it from my ticket. Unless they change the real crab meat mixture from 3% to 30-50%, or at LEAST add that much fake crab meat, I would steer clear of the corn dog cakes."}
{"text":"First time here. Saturday night. No problem getting seated. Great service, good beer selection. Food was really, really good! The waitress recommended the Goon dip. Wowza! Superb! My girlfriend ordered the veggie burger which she loved. I ordered the burger with crab dip (I think, I don't remember the name) but it was great as well. I appreciated the manager went around to every table and asked how everything was. He was very friendly. We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"First visit last night and started out with a sushi roll.  It was quite generous in size and extremely fresh.  Next we ate salad entrees with tuna added.  The Cobb and Wedge salads were each served well-chilled with fresh toppings.  Homemade dressings made them even tastier.  Very pleased with the quality of food served.  Looking forward to returning to try their burgers."}
{"text":"Good place to get s mix of sushi and other foods. Decent prices. Definitely worth the trip if you're in the area and have a taste for sushi but others have other palate choices as well."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, thank you yelp! I wouldn't have driven this far for sushi, but I trusted my fellow reviewers, so big thanks to all ya'll!!

Drive 40 minutes for happy hour sushi and it was well worth it. 

* Loved the ambiance, sat at a high stop near the bar
* Wasn't crowded at all
* Server was great, really nice and laid back, plus attentive 

FOOD
* Ragoon dip - awesome and addictive, however cant use the yelp check-in offer during happy hour, I guess I'll have to go back...darn lol 
* Chaz = by far my favorite!
* Crazy Cali = that wasabi sauce on top, watch out! Still good though after wiping some off haha

2 Small Issues - 
* Construction in area next to our table, kind of awkward but not super distracting. Hopefully that won't be going on much longer
* Waited a little while to get a check, minor pet peeve but just a warning if you a in a hurry

Overall
* Highly recommend stopping out here, really nice place, great sushi, awesome drinks!"}
{"text":"Very good food and the duck wings are amazing.  Our server was fantastic. The manager was feiendly and also checked on us."}
{"text":"Really great sushi and cocktails, but only gave them four stars because;
A) They still don't have any low sodium soy sauce even though they've said for weeks that they are \"getting it in.\" Just go to GFS or Giant Eagle and buy some. 
B) If you are going to their food truck for your lunch hour, don't. As tempting as $2 shushi rolls are, I waited for 45 minutes for ONE VEGGIE ROLL. I almost had to leave and had no time to eat it. And still no low sodium soy sauce."}
{"text":"We looked up burger places and ended up here. 

We ordered the Goon Dip as an appetizer. It was really good. Kinda like the inside of crab rangoon and you dip fried wontons into the dip. The dip was delicious. The fried wontons were very greasy, but fresh. 

My husband ordered the Here Comes Truffle burger medium rare and asked for the brussel sprouts instead of chips. My husband said it was all amazing and exactly what he was wanting. 

I ordered the Mac Attack burger medium and asked for a salad instead of chips. They have several homemade vinaigrette dressings, I went with the orange almond vinaigrette. My meal was delicious!

We decided to order dessert (even though we were full) - We ordered the Hunk O' Love dessert sushi and coffee. The dessert was good - it has actual rice, just like sushi, so that was weird. We really enjoy a good cup of coffee, and this was definitely NOT that. We were disappointed with the coffee."}
{"text":"The food tasted like it was from a cafeteria. The crab meat was imitation and the sweet potato fries were frozen after the server told me they were fresh."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant through Yelp. Nice find! I'd never even heard of this place before. Went for lunch.First, Adina and Ashley were our servers. Such nice people! I felt no pressure to order or leave. They were very personable and we had a couple of nice chats that didn't delay our service (or anyone else's) one bit. Big smiles too. Now, the food! I wasn't super hungry so I ordered two appetizers and no meal. The Serious Sampler and the Poke Salad. Wow, lots of food! More than enough as a meal. The sampler items were all quite good. Nice to try a bunch of things and not spend too much. The Poke salad was delicious and fresh. My wife had the Rainbow Roll. Also delicious. We shared just about everything so we could try as many items as we possible. All were good. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Delicious! I love sushi and I love burgers...but together? Weird concept but nothing short of delicious. Both were done very well and can't wait to try some of their other sushi rolls on my next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Come for happy hour!!! We had the super sonic gin and tonic, stonewall, maple bacon bourbon sour and the s'mores martini to drink. The maple bacon bourbon sour is out of this world! Apps Goon dip (awesome and enough for 4), sushi - Chaz and spicy tuna. Both great! And the Mean Korean to split for an entree. Wow! Great service and CHEAP! It's worth the trip. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Odd restaurant. Menu has sushi and hamburgers. Weird combination. Americanized sushi, to the max. Like... chicken sushi and sushi with steak in it. Huh? The food we ate was wonderful. We had the 'goon dip appetizer, which was like Crab Rangoon. Wonderful! Restaurant didn't have a lot of character, kind of plain. Tables close together. I took the only parking spot left, yet there were a few empty tables. Over all, it was weird menu, great food, but we probably won't be back. We just prefer more of a traditional sushi for dinner."}
{"text":"I tried the twisted nachos with siracha chicken.  Can you say king awesome.  Wow, this has become my husband's and my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"The best!  Love the burgers.  Love the sushi. Love the fries! Love the deserts!  Everything is next level good"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere.  Have not tried the sushi (not a sushi person at all!) but their burgers are excellent!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best food, staff and service I think I've ever had!!!!! If you're not checking this place out- YOU NEED TO! I'd go as far as to say this is the best place in Medina to eat.  Yup. I did.  Challenge me and see if you dont walk away feeling on cloud 9. ;D"}
{"text":"This is a really good place. Their fusion sushi is soo good. I went for a girls night out and it was delicious. I can't wait to take my husband here for dinner. We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I want to start out by saying, I did not dislike this place at all. I'm giving it a three star on the \"A-OK\" end of the spectrum and not the \"MEH\" side. Honestly, I was more confused than anything. This is starting out very vague...let's elaborate shall we?

I have been wanting to try this restaurant for months. We came here for my birthday in July and it had closed at 3. It was a Sunday. Absolutely my mistake for not checking the hours, but really? The hours here are super weird. Not open Mondays, only open until 9 on weekdays, not open before 5 on Fridays and Saturdays, and closes at 3 on Sundays. Weird. Every time I wanted to go here, there was an hour conflict. So finally, four months later, I made it a point to go here for our date night. I was determined! 

Now for the Stars....
2 for parking
We pulled in and there are literally 20-ish parking spots for this place. We had to wait for someone to pull out because every single one was taken. That can't be good for business. If i wasn't so set on going here and there wasn't someone leaving, we would have gone somewhere else. It's November in Ohio. I'm not walking across the street from the dairy queen parking lot to get dinner.

3 for decor
It's a mismatched mix up of modern and something you would find in a SUPER Italian restaurant. You know the kind I'm talking about. With the dark wood dividers, marble pillars, and beige curtains draped everywhere. Where that fits in with stainless steel accents and frosted glass, I'll never know. Plus it's very obvious this used to be an office building or a bank because the entrance has the glass from floor to ceiling with the metal T's. Like something out of Auto-zone or a medical building. I would really like to see some cohesive decor and more intimate seating. We were sat right in the middle of a wide open space. I felt very exposed and kept thinking to myself \"Gee, I hope that family across from us likes watching me suck the beans out of my edamame. That has to be appetizing....\"

3.5 for service
Our waitress seemed a little nervous. It may have been her first week or something. However, she was very nice and patient with me during my hollandaise debacle. What? I really don't like it. She generously offered to put it on the side for me in case I also didn't like their specialty version and that I could have the spicy aioli on the side as well. Hats off to her! This is where it gets weird though...not once, but twice this guy brought food to our table that wasn't ours. Not only that, he took our food to another table before realizing it was supposed to be in front of me being ravenously consumed. Never wave my food under my nose and then take it somewhere else! Do you want me to gnaw off your arm? I didn't think so. 

5 for appetizers
WOW! Hot damn, Twiisted! Blown away by the complimentary edamame. This stuff was seasoned perfectly and there was plenty of it. A very nice touch. We ordered the crab rangoon dip and it was equally as awesome. Such crabby and cream cheesy goodness in one bowl next to a bed of deep fried chips. Heaven. I actually got a little angry each time my boyfriend went for some. My hunger instinct would kick in and I was prepared to duel via chip for the last scoop.....Is that drool on my keyboard?

4 for entrees
I split the difference here. I LOVED my food, fives all around! However, my increasingly picky boyfriend gave the food a three. I maintain it was because he had a regular burger instead of a fancy one. He maintains that a classic burger should be that much easier to make correctly. He may be right...
Never the less, I ordered the Brenner and it was cooked to my exact specifications. As I say that, it seems like I had some outrageous order...when in fact, I just mean medium rare. It was absolutely medium rare and it was delicious. Who would want a burger on top of two waffles garnished with onions and a fried egg? The answer is everyone. Especially me. The waffles made it a tad dry but I think if I had the hollandaise, it would have been fine. The aioli added a nice kick though. My side order of chips (which came late due to earlier guys incompetence) was also delicious. It was a mixture of regular, sweet potato, and some purple chip which we couldn't figure out. I assure you, it wasn't a burnt chip. We still have no idea what flavor it was...
Trevor had the Twiisted Classic and was not impressed. By that, or his side of macaroni and cheese with duck bacon. I will agree that is was a tad on the watery side, but I thought the flavor was nice. What does he know anyways...

Over-all I liked this restaurant. Maybe I had such high hopes after months of reasons why I couldn't try it. Who knows? I have to also hand it to a place that puts cinnamon on the rim of a Christmas ale as well. Not everyone does that and it's nice to see Trevors face light up when he is presented with a cinnamon glass. I am really looking forward to coming back and seeing if we can bump that three up to a five!"}
{"text":"Last night I had the privilege of eating at Twisted Burgers & Sushi. Here are the highlights:

First Impressions:

The atmosphere is modern and clean. A TV above the reception desk displays pictures of their most popular dishes. Whoever takes those pictures does an excellent job. We waited about 20 minutes without a reservation on a Saturday night for a table for two, so not terrible at all. 

Appetizers and Sushi:

Quality, quality, quality. The Goon Dip was DELICIOUS! Warm and creamy and perfectly seasoned with the right amount of crab. And the fried wonton chips make it! For sushi we tried the Chazmanian Devil. From the rice, to the sauces, to the shrimp, everything was wonderful quality. And it was a big roll and was very filling.

Burgers:

WOW! Cheeseburgers just may be my favorite food and I can honestly say this was one of the best burgers I have ever had. We got the Irish Jig Burger which has Corned Beef, Sauerkraut, a crispy potato cake, and their zesty thousand island-esque sauce. The pretzel bun was fresh and was the perfect base. The corned beef was juicy and tender. The kraut and potato cake were wonderful editions.  And the burger itself was excellent quality beef and was cooked to a PERFECT medium rare! I can't wait to try more of their burgers.

Service:

The one issue we had was with how long it took for the food to come out, but MAN they remedied this quick! It took an hour from the time we ordered until the time we got our burgers. We never had to say one word to the staff. The server regularly checked in on us. But the most impressive point of the evening was when the manager saw from a distance that we were getting impatient, came over and apologized for the wait, went to the back and a few minutes later brought our plates out himself, and then comped us the bean dip for our wait while again apologizing! This is the difference between corporate and local! They cared! And not just to appease a boss, they truly cared about our experience and it showed through in how we were treated. We were so impressed that they were so proactive and respectful.

Overall:

5 Stars! Can't wait to go back and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cool place! Kind of feels like it hasn't been there long because it seems little too big for its self with the lacking decor. All that aside, the restaurant is nice, simple, and seemed clean. Service was very friendly and informative. We had a free crab Rangoon dip from checking in on Yelp so we gave it a shot. It was flavorful and tasted exactly as expected! I had a sushi roll that was a crazy combination of a basic Cali roll topped with a garlic salmon, almonds and eel sauce. It was excellent! He stayed with more traditional fare and chose their version of a Cuban sandwich. He loves his Cubans and said this was one of the best he's had! Everything was presented nicely and was well designed. If we are ever back in the medina area we will check it out again, because the first time did not disappoint. As a final note, I loved the sake selection being truly from Kyoto Japan, as we visited Japan last year and love seeing local places carry authentic products."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat. I have been there twice now so I decided I would give a review. 

Sushi was fresh and amazing. Portions are big and the prices are great. 

Burgers at a sushi place? Trust me it just works! There burger selection is hands down one of the best I have ever had to choose from.  Defiantly try the Brenner burger it is amazing."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I are constantly arguing over where to have dinner. He is more of a burger guy where I like to opt for Asian. And here we have it, the perfect marriage of American Asian fusion with Twiisted. The place is huge, dawning modern decor with a laid back feel. We started with the 'goon dip, which was excellent. Shredded crab in an creamy sauce topped with tempura flakes and a Sriracha based sauced for a little kick and served with wonton chips. One of my favorite appetizers anywhere to date. My fianc√© got a burger with crab and wonton chips while I opted to try the sushi, the zombie roll and the crab Rangoon roll, both excellent choices. We went at a time when they weren't crowded but I have heard things get pretty busy (and for good reason). We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Started with the fried provolone cheese and marinara and it was pretty dog gone good. Needed to have a little more marinara for the size of the app. Marinara sauce was fresh and definitely not from a jar, it was amazing! I got the Shroomin burger and my cohort got the Mac attack. Our cheeseburgers were amazing the Shroomin had a fried egg on it cooked perfectly over easy and the twisted mac was as good of Mac and cheese as I have had at any restaurant and worth the money. Bro had an awesome burger too and had the waffle cut sweet potato fries that were really good too. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had a great time today, somewhat new to sushi and the methods of preparation we asked for some help. The chef came to the table and explained thoroughly what and how the sushi and sashimi were prepared.
Great Big Eye Tuna, Calamari was fresh and the fried cake dessert was over the top. 
This was a recon mission for some guests we have coming, cannot wait to get back.
Oh yeah....very reasonably proced."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are fine. Not family friendly in the sense that they don't have a baby changing station in the restaurant. This was definitely a disappointment to a mother of young children."}
{"text":"In Medina while traveling to NY. Thought we'd give it a try. The Goon Dip was great! Kinda like crab Rangoon. Splits blue burger which was great! Recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night and tried the sushi and calamari.  The calamari was straight out of the fryer when it hit the table.  It was hot and delicious.  Next came the sushi.  The quality of the ingredients in the rolls was top notch.  Everybody at our table raved how good the sushi was.  I tried some of the other rolls and they were good.  But my roll had jalape√±os in it.  I knew this when j ordered it, but I expected that they would be cleaned and without seeds.  I can handle spicy foods but these were hot Hot HOT!  I ended up having to take the jalape√±o out of the roll since there were seeds throughout the chopped jalape√±o.  I have to say the service was great and the staff was really attentive."}
{"text":"Great place with a wide variety of options.  Anyone should be able to find something here.  Where I believe they shine is of course, sushi. 

I've had nearly all of their various sushi options, and enjoyed them all.  Portions are fair, but prices are on point with good sushi. 

Over all clean place, with attentive staff.  Great for family, friends cutting loose, or date night."}
{"text":"Sushi! Burgers! I was so excited to try this new place in Medina. I live on the west side of Cleveland but my parents live in Medina and decided to babysit, so me and my girlfriend decided to give it a try. 

First off, parking is atrocious for this place. I had to park in the parking lot at the next door bank. We walked in and were seated promptly, not bad especially since it was a Saturday night at 6:30 (I did make a reservation, as well). The decor was fine but the place almost reminded me of a department store. The bar is completley cut off from the dining area, which I found strange. 

Our server was a guy named Fred and to be honest, he is the main reason this review is at a 2. We ordered drinks, a Moscow Mule (not good, not bad either) & a X-Tasy martini which our server didn't even know was on the menu. It also is listed as a \"Martini\" but it came in a champagne glass. WARNING these 2 drinks cost 10 bucks a piece. My opinion avoid drinking there as the drinks aren't that good and are overpriced.

The food on the other had was a pleasant surprise., especially the complimentary edamame. Going in we weren't sure if we wanted burgers or sushi but we opted for sushi. We had 3 specialty rolls:

1. Pretty Lady-the STAR of the night! Fried shrimp, crab, cream cheese in a soy wrap topped with kiwi and a berry coulis. FANTASTIC! I was super hesitant on this one but I'm glad we ordered it. 
2. Crazy Cali-Crab and avocado topped with spicy crab and a tempura and spicy sauces. This one was above average, definitely packs some heat.
3. Crab Apple-Crab, sriracha, apple and tempura fried. We really did't care for this one. The tempura was overwhelming and didn't really mix well. 

We ended up needing a box for leftovers (3 rolls is very filling). And on to the check...where the night went bad. 

The server got our check and i did have a coupon and had him discount the bill. It took 10 minutes to get the bill back to us. I gave him my card and when he came back i look at the bill and he charged my card for a different patron's order. I pointed this out to him and he said he'd take care of it. He came back with the correct check charged but for some reason asked for my card again. I being hesitant as he already swiped my card twice asked why he needed to swipe it a 3rd time. I decided to ask for a manager who explained that the server rung up my card at the bar POS and not the service POS. So after all this, my $40 meal turned into this establishment charging my card 3 times for approx $110 (my refund to my bank account took 4 days to be reimbursed). I'll admit the manager (Kristi) did give us a $25 gift card for our troubles which was nice but it would have been nice for our server to even apologize for messing up not once but THREE times.

This place would get a 3 for food but the service was terrible. Our server Fred, was not attentive, was clueless with the menu, couldn't charge the bill correctly and I forgot to mention he was super sweaty (it looked like he was on something). 

The sushi was overall pretty good but I definitely would order it to go rather than dealing with FRED on the inside."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean and well spaced. There were a lot of big parties there but the noise level was minimal. The only down side was the wait time between ordering and receiving food. That may have been the longest I've waited for a hamburger luckily the food was good. The kitchen needs work putting out food faster but I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I really liked their food.  I thought it was fresh and imaginative.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We loved that we could order fresh made sushi and bar food at the same location. We did not know ahead of time that you can sit in the bar (loud) or in a \"restaurant environment\" (quieter). We were a group of 4 and would have preferred the quieter side. The sushi was outstanding as were the different bar food orders. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food. I have tried a few items on the menu I enjoyed. Its a Little pricey for some items. Service is good. Fun waitresses"}
{"text":"The grand bone-in pork chop was seasoned perfectly, had a lovely brown sear, and was perfectly cooked juicy. The carmelized onions with fruit jam made tasty accompaniments. The blue cheese was initially missing, but was brought upon request. I enjoyed the rosemary roasted potatoes and the barely-there vegetable medley. Very pleased with this dish."}
{"text":"My family and I have just returned and enjoyed everything!  I would sooo recommend this place. The food was prepared and presented with such class.  Honestly,  my fiancee and my future bro in law,  almost cried and literally talked about how great the food was,  the whole car ride home,  and then some.  Seriously,  get down here and experience heaven,  with just one bite!"}
{"text":"I had such a tough time deciding on how many stars to give Twiisted.  Ultimately, I asked myself, \"Was it good enough to go back?\"  And the answer is, probably not.

So the highlights........
5 stars for the interior.  I really liked the bar area.  Well, until the \"lounge singer\" started his set.  It was way too loud and his songs were the kind you listen to after a break-up. 

5 big stars for the complimentary edamame!  This actually was our favorite part of the meal.  They were coated with allepo pepper and crystalized honey.  I'm headed to Penzeys today to see if I can recreate this at home.

I would also give 5 stars for the service.  Our bartender was very attentive and made us feel like we were his only customers.  

Now, onto the sushi........

I guess I set my expectations too high.  I should have known better, considering that they also serve burgers.  We started with the shrimp explosions.  I liked the presentation a lot, but it was just a big ball of rice coated in a spicy sauce.  We also ordered a couple of their signature rolls and  the traditional spider roll.  Again, way too much rice that didn't have the traditional flavors of sushi rice.   Be careful of the soy sauce as well.  It's very salty.  I couldn't even use it.

If you like \"Americanized\" sushi, then you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Really good food. Miso spicy burger was delicious.  lots of options on the menu ranging from Sushi, clever burgers..."}
{"text":"I'd say my trip to Twiisted was worth about 3.5 stars, but I'm bumping it to four because we went during Happy Hour, so we paid much less than we would have at any other time. The menu is huge and interesting, featuring sushi, burgers, and other entrees. Here's the play-by-play breakdown:

Service: 4 - Our server was really sweet and attentive, and the hostess was pleasant as well. No complaints here.

Appetizers: 5 - Twiisted offers complimentary edamame, which is a nice touch, and it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. With a Yelp check-in, we were able to take advantage of a free order of crab rangoon dip. The dip was served hot, the wonton chips were light and airy, and the dip was crabby, cheesy, and creamy. I would order it again without hesitation, and I'd also like to check out some of their other appetizers...they all sound delicious.

Drinks: 4.5 - Definitely go during Happy Hour for drinks! Great deals here. We had the Fashionable and an Espresso Martini. Although the martini was a bit one-note, they were a hit for $5 each.

Sushi: 2.5 - Well-cooked and seasoned rice is essential to good sushi, and this rice just didn't cut it. It was simultaneously overcooked and undercooked...a bit soggy with crunchy bits still in the middle. One of my rolls had a hard avocado stem inside of it. One of my rolls was not the one I ordered. The texture of the shrimp in the shrimp tempura roll indicated that it had not been freshly fried. I loved the variety of roll options and the rolls were inexpensive (again, due to Happy Hour), but I would have been really upset if I'd paid full price for these. If you're looking for really well-crafted sushi rolls, this wouldn't be on my list. If you're looking for a fun Asian-ish fusion joint, this place is great.

Dessert: 3 - I had the Bailey's creme brulee, which had a weird extra candy sprinkled on the top that I didn't care for. The Bailey's flavored was pretty subdued, as well. He had the New York cheesecake and raved about it because of its richness and thick texture.

Bottom line: there were highs and lows, but I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some of their other non-sushi fare."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite and was not disappointed! American style sushi with some good options. Pretty interior and wasn't too busy on a Saturday early evening."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie but I was apprehensive about this combination of foods. That being said they did both AMAZINGLY!!! We had sushi for an appetizer and it was great!!! Then we had burgers and the Brussels sprouts for lunch. I'd definitely go back!!! Service was spectacular and the time it took for our food was very prompt."}
