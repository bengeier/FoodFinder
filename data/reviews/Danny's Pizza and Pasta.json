{"text":"This is an excellent pizza place in the fort mill tega cay community that delivers excellent pizza and Italian food.  Great for a lazy Tuesday night if you don't want cool or if you are having a football party on Sundays!  One of the better pizza joints in town that I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Will never go back! Ordered a few slices of pizza and guy behind the counter who was also managing the cash register cut my slices with his dirty bare hands, took my money (which we all know is littered with germs) and proceeded to go back and handle the pizza without gloves. I watched him go between the cash register, hand pens to customers needing to sign receipts and cut pizza for other patrons several times without ever washing his hands. It was very unsanitary. I should also mention that the pizza was not that great. Actually it was all around bad. Village pizza is right down the street and a lot better and cleaner! Also it's more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza, easily the best Pizza in Fort Mill.  But for Pizza it's SUPER expensive.  My last 3 topping pizza was around $25!  If you're willing to anti up for some above average pizza, give it a try."}
{"text":"Great NY style pie and sicilian.  Very reasonable prices and friendly, attentive staff."}
{"text":"I'm a SC native and due to my service in the USAF, I've flown and had pizza all over the world. Danny's pizzas are the best. I'll always order here. The best!"}
{"text":"Finally! A place that really knows how to make pizza...and lots of other Italian dishes as well. Excellent Rigatoni a la Vodka, Chicken Parm is delicious, as an entree or in a sandwich...Home made Rice Balls are to \"die for\"' and their desserts are simply the best. Real New York tastes from a real New York baker, Danny adds personal touch to all dishes, soups are flavorful and tasty, staff is very friendly, looking to help with suggestions and great service....And, the pizza is the star, with just cheese, my favorite, or assorted toppings...have the pizza there, where it's piping hot and delectable...Danny's is not to be missed."}
{"text":"soggy crust! not new york !  you can find better. you may have to drive to charlotte."}
{"text":"Great place to get pizza.  Since moving from NY over 7 years ago, I have been looking for good pizza.  I have only found a very small handful of places to get it, none of which were in Fort Mill.  Service isn't quite there yet, but I attribute that to the short time they have been open.  Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for good NY Style Pizza!"}
{"text":"When Mama Theresa's closed after just a few months in the new Danny's location, we figured we'd go back to craving decent pizza in Fort Mill forever or suck it up and pay the ridiculous prices of the one and only really \"fresh\" made pizza in Baxter (not going to happen very often--it's pizza, not filet mignon). No one here knows how to do pizza in true NY style (and believe me, we have tried ALL of them in ten years), but Danny certainly does.   Although the service was kind of a mess the first few weeks they were open, we have been taking out since then, and the pizza has been ready as promised each time.  I will say that I was a bit grossed out that none of the food prep help was wearing hair nets, hats, or gloves, but at least they prepare the pizza right in front of you so you can see where those hands are, and I did not see anyone handling food and then handling money--if that had not been the case, I would have been out of there. Danny, invest in a few paper hats, please! This is the only reason I did not give it five stars.  The crust has the right amount of char on the bottom and is exactly the right thickness to fold--crispy edges, soft on the inside...yum. We only order plain cheese, so I can't speak for toppings. However, the cheese is extremely generous and the sauce does not taste like it came out of a can--just a light, delicate tomato flavor. This is not pizza for the health-conscious; it is loaded with melted cheese and cheese has oil, but isn't that the whole idea behind a good pie? Could go a little lighter on the oregano, but overall, this pizza is delicious. I hope they will stay busy and in business for a long time!"}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in the area. They have other items on the menu, but why bother?  Get a good, greasy slice of NY."}
{"text":"We love Danny's. It is very affordable but more importantly the food is outstanding!!!! Thank you for providing our business with fantastic pizza and great customer service!  Sincerely, Christian Brothers Automotive Tega Cay"}
{"text":"Perfect NY style pizza !  I'm so pleased we took a risk tonight and tried something new. My whole family loved this pizza. We will be ordering pizza at least once a week from now on."}
{"text":"Finally!!!  You have to try this place.  Finally a great authentic NY presence in Fort Mil!  My husband is from Long Island and we have tried almost every Italian pizza place in our vicinity.  Danny's Place is one of those.  The pizza is NY style, great sauce and cheese.  We have tried the chicken parm and the eggplant parm (both excellent).  My son got to eat his first zeppole (yum).  Your products speaks for themselves.  Also, an owner who checks in on his customers and really gets to know them.  We would love to try your steamers when you have your first steamer night and a glass of wine for an upcoming date night. (Hint, hint) So glad you are 5 minutes from us.  Keep up the great work and we will see yas soon!  Jim, Amy and Luke Daniels"}
{"text":"From the Northeast and have been looking for a decent pizza. Have found a couple but so far Danny's is the best we've found. Really enjoy the two slice pizza special for lunch.  We've tried the special pizzas and enjoyed them.  Haven't tried any of the meals yet.  Have eaten in a couple of times and as mentioned by others the service seems to be improving.  Would have given 5 stars but have been spoiled by the likes of Pepe's and Sally's on Wooster St in New Haven."}
{"text":"Mmmmm yummy. Don't judge the place by it being in a strip mall. This place is really great. I am pretty selective of Italian being from upstate NY, but we were really surprised. I had the eggplant parm... very good and the sauce actually had flavor. We cannot wait to try the pizza. They make it right in front of you... the real way. Looks like the place and employees take a lot of pride."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Danny's last week.  I was unsure of what slice of pizza I wanted from the counter when the young lady behind the counter recommended the stuffed meat slice.  She informed me the mountain of a man named Danny by the oven who was strangely not the owner made it and it was delicious - I HAD to try it.  It was delicious, and everyone there was so nice.  I cant wait to try the pasta!"}
{"text":"Danny's WAS our favorite pizza place in York County.  The original owner sold the restaurant several months ago. We attempted to order in or  take out pizzas on numerous occasions. The quality of the pizzas are inconsistent. Some evenings they are excellent and other evenings they are not edible. This is a problem of absentee ownership."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but it was disappointing I had a chicken parm hero and the sauce was super sweet which is a peeve of mine your sauce/gravy should not be sweet, my daughter had the chicken parm entree she didn't like it the chicken was on chewy side and the sauce just not good. My son had the fettuccine Alfredo my husband had the Stromboli it was ok but not enough to go back. But I will say the staff was really nice but that doesn't make the food good."}
{"text":"Pizza is great... But don't forget about their Italian dishes!! Weekly specials never disappoint and chicken parm is always on point!   Bread is average- not a fan of their garlic knots or French loaf that come with dishes. Usually order the appetizer cheesy garlic bread to make up for it.   My favorite thing about Danny's is their marinara, wish they would jar and sell!   Also, favorite cannoli I've ever tasted. Often stop by just to pick up a cannoli. Homemade chocolate cake also a treat."}
{"text":"Good pizza is hard to find (my family drives 3 hours to the nearest Rosati's). I'd say with confidence that Danny's is good pizza and has become our go-to (though when we want cheap pizza we get Domino's). They have great specials in case you're by yourself or one other person. My wife and I typically get the slice + salad combo (there's just something to be said about a good side salad). I'm usually a pepperoni guy, but their cheese is really good as-is, so I just get that every time. I wish they had a better, cozier space but that won't deter me from coming in. The staff are all really very nice and get things done quick.   One qualm is that their thin crust pizza is too thin and because of it, it easily gets overcooked (i.e. - burnt on the bottom). A touch more cheese would be nice as well.   A minor qualm is that the cannolis seem over priced. My experience is they should be $2-2.50 and freshly made (though I've never had the cannoli here so I don't know if it's freshly made or store-bought).  An easy yes if you're looking for pizza."}
{"text":"Moved from NYC just over two weeks ago, and thank goodness for this place. Have only ordered for delivery, service has always been prompt and the delivery drivers have been great. The best pizza will always be in NYC, but since we live here now I imagine we will be frequently ordering from here to get our pizza fix until our next city visit. Thanks for a great pie & delicious garlic knots. The kids actually approve of this place which is huge ( I thought they would never eat pizza again once we left NYC and they tried a chain place!) They even approved of the chicken fingers."}
{"text":"First time here. Overall nice place. Friendly staff and moving from New York it's nice to find some good pizza. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I originally came for the pizza, which is excellent, but I keep coming back for the Italian dishes. O am glad I went out on a limb one night and ordered something other than the great pizza. Now I usually just order the evenings special with confidence that it will be great. Don't miss out on the homemade cannoli. They are addictive!"}
{"text":"The pizza was, meh..... It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. New York style pizza is served here. The dough was just that, doughy. The sauce was pretty bland. The toppings were bland as well. We got our pizzas for carry out but while I was inside I could see that the place was clean and kept up. And the staff was very friendly. I just wish the pizza was better."}
{"text":"Really good NY style pizza!  Danny's is easily the best pizza in the area.  I like getting their white pizza with meatball topping.  There are usually long waits for carry-out pizza on Friday and Saturday nights so expect 45+ minutes for the pizza to be ready during the peak time."}
{"text":"We love Danny's and it's been our go-to pizza place since 2013 when I posted my original 5-star review.  I've noticed however the last couple of times, the tomato sauce on the pizzas have been lacking pretty significantly.  I think it's so important to have a good balance between toppings, sauce & crust but it's very little tomato sauce and the tiny bit of sauce that is being put on the pizza has been pushed out to the edge.  Very disappointing when we pay good amount of money for an above average pizza and it's off balance.    Please...please...please look into this and find out what's going on as it seems your quality control is off."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Fort Mill area! Great New York style pizza that's very worth the trip and the price. Nice staff, too!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza to go. Asked for it well done. Was not even cooked normal. Had to put in my oven at home. Sauce has no flavor. 18 bucks for a large cheese pizza. Very overrated."}
{"text":"The first time I had Danny's pizza (cheese), it was very good and made me want to have it again.  The second time, my wife and I got two slices of pepperoni pizza and garlic knots.  The garlic knots were very good, but the pepperoni pizza was super greasy.  I had to lay two paper towels on top of the pizza slice to soak up the grease before I could eat it. I then wrapped the wadded up greasy paper towel in another paper towel, and the grease soaked through that second paper towel.  After soaking up all the grease, the pizza was pretty good, but why so greasy to begin with?  I would give the pizza another chance, but may stick to plain cheese pizza if the pepperoni is going to be that greasy.  On the plus side, the service and the garlic knots were both excellent."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing! I've never been to New York but this pizza is seriously delicious! The staff is super friendly too. Next time I'm definitely going to try a dessert, they look really yummy!"}
{"text":"I love these owners! They are some of the kindest most generous people I have ever met. The pizza is spot on and I am a former New Yorker. Staff is friendly and helpful and food is always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We've lived in Fort Mill for 4 years and this by far the best pizza place for the money.  If you hate Empires oily, runny pizza get a Danny's New York Pizza \"well done\". It will be perfect.  The Sicilian Pizza has a thick crust that my kids loved. The salads are excellent & the Italian dressing is awesome.  I love the cannoli because they are really fresh and not overly sweet.  The beer selection is nice without a draft option.  The wine list is simple but fits the menu.  Jessi was our waitress twice and was very attentive and nice (a rarity in Fort Mill eateries)."}
{"text":"When we first moved here a few years ago it was great. It was our go to for pizza. Being from New York it was great. We went over the weekend and it was awful. We heard there were new owners. The dough was undercooked. There was so much cheese and very little sauce. We ordered two pies to go and a lasagna. The lasagna was terrible. Way to much cheese. It used to be great. To bad it's so awful. Having New York pictures on the wall doesn't mean great pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome.... Menu was good.  Lots of options.  Service was slow.  Looks like delivery is their main business.  After waiting 15 minutes for my order of two slices....  Watched cook grab a slice of cold pizza and throw it in the oven.  Tasted good but was a bit soggy after being reheated?  Asked waitress to split check and waited another 5 minutes and she came back with the same check totaled together.  Just paid it because I could not wait any longer.  Will never return!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Service was great and pizza was even better! We had pizza at the table, but I opted for the Mediterranean Salad. It was fabulous! We will definitely be eating there again. BTW- our server was Alexis and she was great! She kept my kids entertained and provided excellent service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was mediocre. The crust was soggy, the sauce bland, and the toppings cheap. There was nothing really redeeming about the pizza. Inside there are only a few tables, and outside ... on the sidewalk of an outdoor shopping mall, is not really an option unless you want to breath auto exhaust, and talk to shoppers as they walk right in front of your table. It is over priced for what you get .... and what you get is a pizza that is barely edible, and certainly not worth keeping for left overs -- I threw 1/2 of it away."}
{"text":"This place. I was *slightly concerned because of the location. (It was given 4 stars,  but where it was felt more two star). But y'all. Their fried ravioli right off the bat, ridiculously good. The ricotta cheese was phenomenally light and enjoyable. We got their MJ, a white sauce, topped with garlic and spinach. We added bacon,  and it was one of THE BEST pizzas I've ever had. It was quick, it was easy, and the food was wonderful. Definitely a great place to go for great pizza!"}
{"text":"Best pizza since I left NJ in 2010. I won't even bother to go anywhere else for a pie now. And the manicotti? Ohmigoodnessss! Amazing... Don't even get me started about the cannoli - it's like... If heaven had a taste - it would be like Danny's cannoli."}
{"text":"Would order Papa Johns before I ordered this place again. My review isn't due to quality of food, but to their employees. Good luck when dealing with these folks."}
{"text":"Delicious Rice Ball!  Pizza is good as well!"}
{"text":"We came straight from NYC to eat at Danny's Pizza and they let our daughter make her own pizza bites. Seriously how cute is Danny's and delicious!!"}
{"text":"They have a great lunch special and the staff is very friendly. I was with a group of 10 and the waitress did an excellent job and was very attentive without being overbearing. The pizza was just ok though. The fettuccine and the sweets looked amazing. Would be willing to go back to try those and even to give the pizza another shot."}
{"text":"Love the pizza! Great for kids since you can just order a single slice of pizza, saves money! Also, I ordered a personal pizza and it was soooo good! Really enjoyed my meal here! The pizza is thin crust too, definitely New York styled!"}
{"text":"Dannys has the best pizza in the Charlotte area hands down. I order from them at least once a week for the last 18 months or so and its been on point almost every time . The 1-2 times out of 75+ it wasn't absolutely perfect they took care of it for me without any type of issues or having to argue with management team. Danny( the owner ) and Danny( the manager ) both clearly realize that their customers make the business go and do what they can to keep you happy . 5 stars for the service you receive and 5 stars ( only because I can't give more ) for the pizza . Absolutely amazing food with just as amazing management running the place . I was considering 2 homes to purchase recently that I was very undecided on . Honestly , the fact that one of them was in Dannys delivery area played into my decision because the properties were so close to the same to me . Outstanding pizza !!! Highly recommend to anyone who doesn't want the mediocre pizza of the national chains!"}
{"text":"Danny's Pizza and Pasta opened a couple of weeks ago in front of the Tega Cay Walmart.  A few people said good things about them, but a lot of people also said that about the recently opened Mama's in Indian Land and it was not too good.  Danny's was slightly better, but not by much.  After receiving a 20% off coupon in the local coupon magazine, I figured it would be worth a try.    The people working were very friendly.  I ordered an 18 cheese pie.  It was decent, but was overdone (what is it with the pizza places around here overcooking the pies?  This was charred on the bottom, like many other local places).  The dough had some flavor to it, the sauce was okay, and oregano was added to the top of the pizza.  If your pizza is good, oregano is not necessary (see Lorenzo's/Junior's).  The dough was slightly thicker than NY style, but not by much.  They don't say they are NY style, but it definitely is.  The menu is also a bit limited.  There are no chicken wings, but they may be good because most places similar to this around here do not make good ones.  The pizza topping choices are also a bit limited.  It is a small place, so it is understandable, but it is always good to have choices.  So, this is again one of those pizza places that just needs a couple of tweaks.  Next time, I will order the pizza light baked and without oregano.  I think it would make it very good."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Had garlic knots, fried ravioli, and 18\" Meatalicious pizza. Generous portions for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Danny's is a great local pizza place! Definitely my favorite Pizzeria around! Every time I've gone there I've always left extremely satisfied.   The pizza is the only thing I've gotten from there (besides italian ice) but really that's the most important! All the ingredients are fresh and tastes great. The pizza sauce has a nice zing to it and the crust is the perfect mix of  doughy and crunchy! My only complaint os that the middle of the pizza does get soggy after it sits for a few minutes.   The service has always been stellar! I honestly can't complain about it. I was even  sitting outside waiting for a pizza and they forgot where we were sitting so they gave our pizza away. They apologized profusely and gave us a fresh pizza and some freebies  as a bonus. Very nice and great place to be!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Danny's also is a huge supporter of every local school event."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and tried multiple dishes including the pizza and chicken Marsala. I wasn't fond of the chicken Marsala dish but the pizza and pasta dishes are excellent. It's a smaller restaurant for sitting but they do have a patio section. However because of this they only have 1 or 2 servers so patience is necessary if not ordering out. Definitely give this place a try"}
{"text":"Was craving a calzone and went to Dannys came out craving satisfied. Very delectable and filling to say the least. Staff was attentive and the service was timely. Will go back."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was a bit slow and scattered but very friendly. I'm sure we just caught them on a bad day. Nothing to write home about but it was ok for lunch."}
{"text":"Maybe we just had a bad experience the other night, but our service was horribly slow and started out with the waitress apologizing for her not clearing the only available table for us for 5 minutes while we stood next to it. Then she didn't get our drink order for several more minutes. Finally the manager came over to at least get the drinks. When they came, they tasted horrible and the waitress (had to flag her down) made an excuse that the ice machine was in disrepair and making all the sodas taste wrong. Interesting. If that was the case wouldn't you think that they might have told us before taking our drink orders? But oh well.   Ordered an appetizer of garlic knots. They arrived after 10 minutes and tasted old - like they sat out for a while and were re-warmed and they weren't good. We didn't eat them. To their credit, they brought fresh ones without us saying anything and those were much better.   The food was average for a pizza joint in Fort Mill, which isn't saying much. It's ok, not bad but not great either.   Some of the other items on the menu looked good as we saw other tables receiving their orders. Maybe we'll give it another try and order something other than pizza and get recyclable drinks!"}
{"text":"The bang bang wings are super delicious - their signature if you ask me. Service in the restaurant and deliver has always been great. Danny's is our staple cheat night in Tega Cay and they haven't let us down. I highly recommend for wings, pizza, Stromboli... heck, everything's good!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my honey and there were several yummy lunch special options all under $10! There was also several \"slices of the day\" that were available for the pizza specials. We had the garlic knots to start which were great and I had a chicken, bacon & garlic slice, while my fiancé had the rigatoni with vodka sauce and added chicken. Both choices came with your typical pizza parlor side salad- fresh but nothing special. However, I was really wow'd at the end with the chocolate dipped canoli we got. So. Fabulous! Service was good, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"BEST pizza I've had since moving back to York County from Chicago (I truly prefer New York-style pies, not thick Chicago-style, by the way). Danny's pies are New York-style thin crusts with chewy borders and a delightful yeasty aftertaste that a lot of pizzas I've eaten lack. Also, if you're accustomed to ordering small, medium and large pies, Danny's pizza sizes are larger than most other places, with 10, 18, and 24 inch crusts. We ordered the 18\" Extreme Specialty pizza and the Family Special #4, which is a one-topping 18\" pizza (pepperoni), garlic knots, and a dozen wings. Those pies were so delicious, piled thick with fresh toppings and perfectly baked. The wings are not the over-breaded greasy variety that you may have grown to expect from some places, but meaty, flavorful and tossed in your choice of sauce. We opted for mild and they were amazing, tangy, with a crisp skin. Found my go-to pizza place (thanks, Yelp)!"}
{"text":"We tried Danny's for the first time today and we weren't disappointed. The service was superb and we both really enjoyed our pizza. The slices are huge, we each ordered 2 slices and ended up taking the second one home for dinner. My boyfriend ordered the meat lover's and says it's great the second time around as well. I ordered a slice of extreme and a slice of the margiano. The extreme was delicious but I wasn't a fan of the margiano. I tasted it fresh and it wasn't bad, but I decided not to eat it reheated. Not much selection of specialty pies, but what they do have all sounds pretty tasty. Seems a little pricey on the pasta side of things, but we are big fans of local restaurants so we will definitely go back to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"1st visit tonight, wanted to make a donation for the officer in need...i got the rigatoni with vodka sauce, 3 garlic knots, and a salad....everything was very good, sauce was perfect....will definitely be back...( was a take out, and order was ready when it should be)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza around.. Order here when you need a pizza fix.. If you get the huge pie, at most places quality goes down a little.. Not here, every slice was devoured during super bowl.. Great service as well.. I also hear the owners are great people through the vine.. What's not to like.."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! The MJ is delicious! The entire family loves this local pizza joint. The pizzas are huge and always fresh. We love to order from here for a party or just for a family night in. Wonderful owners, great staff and great food! Their desserts are also great!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza but sometimes they have not had my take out order ready when promised."}
{"text":"Had a little bit of time so stopped in for a quick lunch . Had a slice of pizza and salad for $6 good . Pizza has great crust good flavor salad was fresh with house dressing overall very good. This is not a fancy place more like atypical New York pizza by the place both casual and comfortable."}
{"text":"Our family dined in last night and everything was DELICIOUS! My husband and I are very picky about pizza and he said we will not be ordering from anywhere else again! The kids enjoyed it too. So glad to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Didn't care too much for this place.  Friend's were telling us to try the food, that the owners are from NY.  We tried it but the food did not compare to NY pizza in my book.  We ordered a grilled chicken over salad and a couple slices of pizza.  Salad was just ok, same quality as if I bought it in the pre-made section of the supermarket and the slices must have been old and re-heated.  Nothing here makes me want to come back, so many places to eat here that in my opinion you need to stand out to get business,  this place does not do it for us.  Especially pizza, coming from NY, there is a certain expectation that follows,  it has to be good, quality ingredients,  anything else is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I know I'm going to be the 1 millionth New Yorker to rate \"New York\" style pizza in the carolinas. What all of us \"Yankees\" need to realize is that we are not in New York anymore and we have to make due with what is available to us.     That being said, I entered Danny's Pizza and Pasta in Tega Cay, SC with not a lot of expectations. It was right before lunch, so I grabbed a couple of slices to go. The cashier was friendly and the place was clean, so we are off to a good start.      I sat in my car, throw open the box and liked what I saw. Looked just like the stuff I grew up eating. The smell was wonderful. I guess I should mention I was starving. The pizza was delicious. It wasn't spot on NY pizza, but it was really freaking good. If I had any critique, it would be that there was something missing in the sauce and they could have left the slices in the oven a minute longer. That's just being picky. Danny's is definitely a hit in my book. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"By far the VERY BEST pizza I have eaten EVER!  My best friend took me there (the Cruz Family) while I was on vacation and we ordered the MJ...HOLY MOTHER OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THIS WORLD...amazing!!!!! I'm in love and the only bad thing about Danny's Pizza and Pasta is that they don't have a location in every state :-( ...maybe one day!"}
{"text":"Danny's pizza is my new second. Mozerella is fresh and smooth, crust is crispy. Fries are steak cut with skins, perfectly seasoned. While the sauce is sweet, the saltiness of the cheese makes up for it. If you like a true New York pie, ask for half sauce."}
{"text":"This place has so many good reviews so I decided to give it a try and I was completely disappointed. I know it's hard to find good pizza in the south and as an Upstate New Yorker I have a hard time finding just that.  I ordered delivery service and was told that I would receive my order in 45 minutes. I got off the phone and the time was 3:23pm When my delivery finally came at 4:55pm, I was greeted by a nice driver that apologized for taking so long. The pizzas were in flimsy boxes and when I opened them the pizza looked horrible. Tasted bland. Cheese was very skimpy, dough was very chewy, and the sauce... Disgusting. No taste at all. The garlic knots were not good either.  Worst experience all around. I will be sure to stick with Village Pizza as they have never displeased me.  Like I said, I only tried Danny's because of the reviews. Sorry, but obviously people have not had good pizza before if they actually think that Danny's is good!!"}
{"text":"This place is the jams . Seriously best pizza in the south . The owner used to make pizza at the pizza place I used to eat at in middle school on Long Island . Seriously go eat here!"}
{"text":"Service was super nice and spot on Saturday! We had a group of 8 and we arrived later in the afternoon and it worked out  great!  Got two large pizzas and wings special combo."}
{"text":"Definitely not NY pizza. I couldn't taste the sauce..pizza was dried up. Service was great. But Pizza is def not up to par. pizza was dry. Just when you walk in you see the dried up pizzas sitting there. The problem with that is once it goes back in the oven, itdries up the sauce and cheese. So they need to learn to resauce or rewater their pizza before it goes back in the oven. For FORT MILL standards it is good pizza. They also short change the folks on the size of the slice. It is a tad smaller than a regular slice. I am from Brooklyn.  So anyone reading...do not go by reviews from people upstate NY or outside of the boroughs. True NY pizza lives in Brooklyn FYI. Not manhattan, not the bronx, not LI let alot alone upstate. That is a no no."}
{"text":"Ordered meals for 5 people. 1 Cheese Calzone, 1 Baked Ziti, 1 Pasta Alfredo, and 2 Lasagnas. We got the confirmation email at 6:01 PM they said it would be 7:22 PM or around there. Then we get a call at 6:18PM, there was a mistake on our part, on the Alfredo. They said they would take care of it. 7:40 PM no food. My wife calls to check and they say that they got slammed and it takes that long and it's on it's way. 7:53 PM they call us back apologizing that they never printed the receipt and it was overlooked. Finally at about 8:10 the food arrives. The delivery guy, who was great by the way, was very polite and apologetic. He wouldn't accept a tip even though he had no part in the problem. Now on to the food. The calzone was cold and oily. My daughter had to throw it in the microwave to make it even remotely hot. None of the other dishes were remotely hot either. My son's Alfredo was cold and had separated, you could tell it had sat around for a while as it was semi-transparent. I would call it lukewarm at best. The Ziti was cold and flavorless unless you count the over use of both thick sliced and chopped garlic. The lasagnas were not even close to warm. There was way too much garlic in this as well. no one ate all of their entree and I had to share my salad with my daughter. The salads were very bland but I will say they were the highlight of the meal. It's kind of hard to screw up bagged salads not that they didn't try though by not giving enough dressing with them. They threw in an order of garlic knots. They should have kept them. They were very. close to being underdone and no flavor at all. We'll never eat there again. I have half a mind to dispute it with the CC company. It's that bad.   Edited 9-5-17 I was contacted by the company and they did in fact refund our purchase price. they took ownership of the issue and took steps to remedy the situation. As I responded to the owner every business has it's off days and everyone has bad luck. The two just seemed to coincide on this occasion. It wasn't personal on either side just the way things worked out. I wish them luck with the new location in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Danny's regularly but the quality of their foot has really suffered over the last year. Definitely not what it used to be. A bummer because it used to be great.   Sept 2017 Update - got a Meatalucious pie (used to be our fave) and the toppings were about 30% less than before.   Sorry Danny's. You used to be so great. I was hoping you improved since my last visit. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for the first time last night on a whim... sad it took me so long to find this upstate Italian gem!!! Being originally from upstate New York, I haven't found any places that even compare to that NY Italian.... UNTIL DANNYS! Now I can only comment on the pizza thus far because I hadn't even scoped the whole menu and reviews to see suggestions. But some fellow NYs said the cannoli is fresh and true to home cafes so tonight I will have one, or two ;)  ANYWAYS... THE PIZZA WAS PERFECTION. Tastes identical in every aspect to authentic upstate pizza!! So so delicious!  If I could make a suggestion to the owners... {not sure what you grew up with.... but ...} I would love to see authentic upstate Syracuse/Utica tomato pie, or \"pusties\" (pasticiotti) on the menu... *drool*    Okay time to order tonight's feast!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good but pasta is not as good. Too much sauce on my ravioli - was drowning.  Also tea in not brewed. Waitress said \"place is owned by a New Yorker that does not drink tea - so he won't let us brew it. She has offered to brew it but has been told not to. \". Too bad."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but very poorly managed. There's no waiting list for tables and customers fight over them. If you call for pick up they say it will take an hour, even though when you order at the table it only takes about 20 minutes. So they clearly delay pick up orders purposely. It doesn't matter how good the pizza is if you're unable to get a table or even pick up an order."}
{"text":"Danny's has been around for quite some time and I finally decided to place a carryout order with them. The 45 minute ready time was a bit disappointing, but maybe that meant people love the place so they are busy on a Saturday.   The young girl that took the call seemed a bit confused or flustered when I was trying to explain my order.  I waited the time and went to pick it up. Most everyone working there seemed flustered and necessarily happy to be there. Odd.. for a busy time.  The pizza was huuge! Very delicious and you can definitely tell a difference compared to the national chain pizza brands. So much better. We also ordered two side salads. They were a decent size, with basic iceberg, tomato, cheese in a traditional aluminum round container.  Will certainly be back. Check mailers and the website for coupons!"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good better than anything you can get from pizza hut or papa johns. I had the Chicken Alfredo with a side salad. It was yummy and the side salad was pretty big I almost got full off it."}
{"text":"Never had a bad pie or slice.  As close to NY Pizza as you will get in the Fort Mill area. Lunch is a great value and quick.  If you like your crust extra crisp, just ask and they will do it.  Specialty pizzas are fantastic and great deserts."}
{"text":"I've only had the pizza but if you like white pizza, you need to try the white with meatball.....I've had a lot of white pizza and this may just be my favorite! Of course the classic pepperoni is also a winner. Definitely call ahead because they're usually packed, especially on a Friday night...my only complaint is that usually they under quote me on wait time and it ends up being more like an hour rather than 45 minutes on a Friday night. I've gone a few times on Sunday and the wait is much shorter. Also, there are not a lot of places to sit so I just pick up my food to go."}
{"text":"Great food, great people! I'm from NY and finally found great Italian food locally! Everything on the menu is good! They are always so nice when my 1 year old makes a mess too!"}
{"text":"This place in Fort Mill has poor customer service. I asked for a delivery order 2 weeks ago and I was told they did not have any drivers and call the Tega Cay location. When I called they did not make philly cheese steak that the Fort Mill location makes. I called today and placed an order they told me it would take 30 - 40 minutes for a delivery. I waited 50 minutes and called them back and I was told we do not deliver to that location and we tried calling you back and left a message, I stated I have been sitting here and you did not call back. I noticed the charge was on my card so I called back and asked why did you charge me, he explained the routine about the money being put back on the card tomorrow and sorry we do not deliver there anymore and we do not have any steak here. I said that is not true I have ordered from there before and they delivered, he said yeah we stopped about 2 months ago. Thant is a lie, I ordered from them 2 weeks ago. These workers are missing how important integrity is, the food I good but they have no integrity."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Fort Mill! Closest to NY style in the area! The actual restaurant is small and the layout is not as family friendly as other local pizza places, but the quality is there. Again, best pizza in town!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better pizza. Got a buffalo chicken pizza not on the menu. My wife got a stomboli and it was one of the best I have ever tasted. So glad we decided to move into Brayden. Now we can eat here all the time. Empire is good but usually packed."}
{"text":"I received awful service from this business. I was put on hold for every single question I asked regarding the menu and had to repeat myself several times because the person taking my order over the phone said that she kept \"accidentally forgetting\" what I said. Then I was charged 30 dollars for 2 salads? When I asked where this bill came from, I was told the Mediterranean salad was $11.95, yet the menu says it's priced at $9.50..... when I asked why I was being charged an additional $2.45 extra per salad, I was told \"I'm not sure why the salad is priced differently, but I don't see the menu or really have an explanation\". When the salads arrived they didn't even have the feta or pita bread that is supposed to be included. I was told by friends to order salads from Carmella's pizza and save my time, but figured I would give this place a try, I definitely will not waste my time nor money in this local small business again."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious. They have specialty pizzas that blow others out of the water. Easily the best pizza in town.  But the reason I keep going back... The desserts. All made by the owners wife. Cheesecake- light delicious and you can taste the ingredients. Not just sugar and add-ins like a lot of places. Red Velvet cake- this cake changed my life. It is super moist and loaded with cream cheese icing. So big the to go box has trouble closing. Amazing. The chocolate cake is yet to be tried. And they even make their own canoli cream. Yowsa! Don't miss this."}
{"text":"Finally tried Danny and was not disappointed. The regular pizza slice was closer to NY than any other place. Minimally greasy which is what I want. I just don't like that you order a slice, they yell the order to the back kitchen ( while the ovens and pizza are in the front) and then you wait ten minutes and they bring the slice out to you at a table or counter. ( only a couple of customers there when I went). They will bring you parm cheese & red pepper but not the garlic. You have to go to the front to retrieve the spice. They need more counter space to sit at and/ or single or double person tables.  It would be just like NY if you could order the slice at the counter and wait a minute or two, they hand you the slice and then go sit wherever you want.  Maybe with practice this will happen. I will go back for the pizza but to hell with the service. PS: I spent a little over $5 for one slice and a small soda. A bit pricey, I think."}
{"text":"I should have known better.  We ordered 4 slices, sat down and waited and waited and waited. I finally walk up and asked about our food. It was on the side I guess she forgot. Then we ate and it was cold and horrible. Myself being from Brooklyn the only thing here from New York is their prices. I'm sure in Charlotte there has to be better.   My guess the only reason they stay in business is luck. Their customers don't know any better."}
{"text":"The special (one of them anyway) was a slice with meatball, pepperoni and sausage. Really tasty and on great crust, light and crispy with a bit of chew. I'll be back. Great outdoor seating spot that is on the shade at lunch!"}
{"text":"Be warned, it takes Over 1 1/2 hours for delivery. Unacceptable, and nothing but \"sorry\" from the staff when I called express dissatisfaction"}
{"text":"Yum! We started with the garlic knots which were delicious. For the meal I got the special of salad and a slice of pizza (came with a drink) for $6. My husband got the 18\" white pizza...it was huge! The taste of the food was fresh and the wait staff was super friendly. Great family friendly restaurant!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery using the Danny's Pizza app. The ordering process was easy, our food was delivered promptly, and it tasted great. Will definitely order from Danny's again!"}
{"text":"Here it is, my 1000'th review of 2015. A pizza joint in Fort Mill, SC. Danny's is a nice looking spot at the end of this small strip plaza that is an outparcel of the Walmart Supercenter.  A gelato bar at the left when you enter and then the counter with fresh pizza slices available further back. Of course, they do a lot more than pizza but that's all I felt like having today. So I picked my slice and the gal had it heated up and brought to me a few moments later.  Sicilian-style, meatball and ricotta. Plenty hot, nice and tasty. I loved the crispy crunchy pizza crust underneath and the toppings completely covered it. Very tasty. I'll have to come back here for something more than just a slice.  There's an outside patio, which is nice. If you can ignore the fact that it overlooks a Walmart parking lot."}
{"text":"I've been in the Charlotte area since 1994 and have found a couple decent places for pizza but Danny's is the first place that I truly feel is special.  It might be because they have Sicilian slices that I haven't had so good since leaving N.Y.  Their Grandma's slices are Sicilian thick slabs covered with fresh, chunky tomatoes and fresh basil. It really reminds me of the way my grandmother made pizza.  Maybe that's why I like Danny's so much.  But if it is that is as good a reason as any.   Best pizza in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Plain pizza is good . There grandma Sicilian slice is very good . Some of the toppings on other pizza are way To salty . Entrees aren't very good ."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of good pizza, I love to eat it, smell it cooking and thinking of different pizza topping combinations. I do not eat chain pizza! This place is like eating with family, it is close to the house so we can cruise over on the golf cart and enjoy dine in or carry out. Pizzas a huge with big foldable slices, great fresh dough and toppings every time. Staff is very friendly and they have a good selection of bottle beer."}
{"text":"NY pizza and NY customer service or lack there of. This place appeared to be a decent place until they crewed up our order. We specifically asked for the vegan pizza without cheese; after waiting 30 min for the pizzas we drove back home. The pizza had in cheese so we called and they said to bring it back. My wife drove all the way back from Charlotte and they just gave a new pizza-no sorry or nothing. They should have delivered it to us and not charge us anything for their screw up. What if my daughter had not checked and eaten it? This place is a piece of crap, the food is not even close to anything from New York and I am from up north so I know pizza!"}
{"text":"The perfect place for a quick dinner. So many choices.  The Philly cheese is the best. The roll is light and crisp.  Their salads are so fresh and has a variety of vegetables.   Lots of stringy mozzarella cheese on the pizzas.  We have never had a bad experience.."}
{"text":"For those who have followed some of my posts, you know I'm not so easy especially on Italian food. So coming down to South Carolina has been a challenge on finding half way decent pizza. Someone from NY when I was in Walmart, said go to Danny's right up the hill.   Well I have to say this is definitely a top pizza on my list!  The sauce was almost as good as my mom's. Liked the meatball and ricotta slice. The meat lover stuffed pie was just as tasty and the dipping sauce was like a wow wow. Liked it was not so acidity as other place I thought were good were.  The zeppoli are definitely not the way mom made them and were not my omg I feel like I am at home with mom again, BUT, the absolutely  passed my I would go for more again.  Loved the staff who I felt like I may have scared them when I said I heard they were authentic NYer and I'm testing out NY places for authenticity.  Take a breath for now you passed this Italianmomma1's tasting, but I will be back for other sampling"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and even better garlic knots! Delivered hot and fresh to my office which was nice and convenient. I'll definitely be eating here more often and wish I'd found this place sooner!"}
{"text":"The Tega Cay location has been one of our regular work lunch spots during the week, because their pizza is so good, no one ever tires of it.  Danny's is hands-down the best pizza I have had in the Charlotte/Fort Mil/Tega Cay area.  My personal favorite is the Roman pizza + proscuitto, but my co-workers love the Meatalicious pizza.  They do have other entree options (pasta, stromboli, calzones, etc.) that are OK and good for the sake of variety, but you would be an idiot to come here and not eat the pizza.  Come for lunch -- great lunch specials!  I do agree with one of the other reviewers here that their quality has changed a bit over the last year, but I wish he hadn't left a 1-star review, as that is NOT an accurate representation of Danny's.  Their pizza is still one of the best in the area, without question.  They recently opened a second location in Fort Mill, so I am not sure whether this change in quality is just a result of new staff being trained (a problem with any small business expanding), so don't let that deter you from coming!"}
