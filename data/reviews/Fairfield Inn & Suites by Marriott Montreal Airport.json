{"text":"This is a dope hotel that's nice and clean. I walked into the lobby full of children and a teenage party in a banquet hall. Front desk service was impeccable. Once I arrived at my room, it was quiet and very comfortable. My room had to be accessed by going through one keycard door that gave access to my guest room and one other guest room. Great security feature."}
{"text":"I stay here when on business trips near the Montreal airport. As noted by others, a solid value for a Fairfield Inn. The excellent and friendly staff are a key attribute of this property."}
{"text":"The parking I seemingly big, but I am sure they still run out of it. Clean rooms, very nicely done. The cafe/lounge is real good with some good selections. Approach is not straightforward, but drive in once and becomes easy enough. The staff is good and efficient as well. Very nice stay overall"}
{"text":"This place is pretty sweet for those fancy 30 hour business trips when you get yourself ripped a new one by the québécois.

My tv didn't work but my clock radio had an mp3 hookup and no one cared when I turned the heat to 75.  it was quiet despite the close proximity to the airport.  the shuttle to and from the airport was easy and fast, breakfast was pretty good.  basically, no complaints."}
{"text":"This Fairfield Inn by the Montreal airport is a waaaaay better than average airport hotel ...and also is NOT your typical Fairfield Inn.  There is a good bar, that is not too large but is well stocked, that has some good bartenders.  They serve food in the bar and in the adjacent restaurant that is better than average, especially for a hotel.  Montreal is a great city for going out in ...but I was in recently for a quick 1-night turnaround trip, and a visit to a nearby office park, so I was happy to stay on site  Both the bar and the restaurant offer good service.  There is a beef cheeks meal on the menu that I have now had on two different stays to this location.  If you like tender beef and beef prepared like pot roast you will like this dish.  There is a convenient shuttle to and from the airport.  The staff for the hotel is friendly and efficient.  The rooms are typical of a Fairfield ...and that is a good thing.  I was able to not rent a car by staying here and using Uber to get to my meetings.  This Fairfield Inn is total \"do again\" if it matches my requirements for a trip."}
{"text":"Finally the lobby restaurant has changed the menu. I was quite pleased to see a bacon cheese burger on the specials list. I ordered the Caesar burger,as it was called, and went out for a smoke. Came back and there was a burger sitting at my table. Thought that it was rather quick. Took a bite and realize this was a plain cheeseburger. No toppings whatsoever. I pointed it out to the waitress, and she told me that was what I ordered. She offered to bring side toppings, but after traveling all day I wasn't interested in piecing together my own burger. Whatever. A few minutes later, the other waitress walks up with a loaded burger. She looked puzzled. And we agreed that the other girl screwed up. I didn't get my deluxe burger. Mr Plain Cheeseburger in the other section got mine. 
Got my bill and was charged for loaded burger. Asked girl if loaded burger is same price as a cheese and meat sandwich. I didn't get a suitable answer. I'll still come here, but will stick to something they can't screw up."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here for one night during a trip to Montreal. We got in quite late and didn't want to have to travel all the way downtown before getting to the hotel. This hotel is right next to the airport and offers a convenient airport shuttle. The room was fairly standard but well appointed, clean and comfortable. We had a king bed (which was harder to find, later on our trip in Montreal), flat screen tv, nice shower/tub combo, and free internet access..We didn't have any trouble with noise, even though it's right next to the airport. The night we stayed the city was experiencing some water pollution issues so we couldn't drink the water but the front desk had bottled water on hand and ready. The breakfast buffet was sufficient, with enough selection to please me and my husband. The staff is multilingual and quite friendly and accomodating. All in all a good stay - we'd stay here again."}
{"text":"This hotel turned out to be the best place for us especially since it is located within walking minutes near the Via Rail train station and provides 24 hour free shuttle minutes to the airport.  The accommodations are aligned with the high quality or service that I have experienced with the Marriott corporation for decades. I was really pleased with the exceptionally friendly staff, free breakfast, laundry facility, comfy beds, and overall cleanliness. I highly recommend this facility for families with kids."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest Marriot hotels I have been to. I don't speak French but English and the hospitality was still good. We didn't get different treatment and we got a smile, please, and thank you; which is always a good sign to me when traveling."}
{"text":"Very nice hotel, large room, decent breakfast, very clean, nice and helpful staff.  Overall a good experience.  My only suggestion to the hotel is to try to get the shuttle to the airport to be a little more predictable.  Sometimes it was more frequent while other times it was late."}
{"text":"OK, so Montreal has a lot of \"airport\" hotels. The thing is...most are located 10 minutes from the airport. I mean really...at some point you need to avoid calling it an airport hotel, even if you have an airport shuttle. Fairfield, on the other hand, is actually very close. It's not quite the Marriott located AT the airport (which is lovely, but they charge for it), but it's only a couple of minutes away by car or shuttle, at around half the cost of the Marriott located above the US terminal.

Check-in was speedy and friendly. I ended up with a handicap room, so it had some extra space and was huge. It was the size of a suite, but without the sofa and other things a suite has. I also ended up with a great view of the planes departing off of Runway 24L. Free WiFi was really quite slow and not great...but it was free nonetheless. 

Noise wise, it's not bad. I was on the end near the train tracks, so I could hear that, but it never woke me up by any means. Neither did the planes. 

Breakfast was okay, but was the same thing both mornings - eggs, bacon, breads, juices. At night, the restaurant/bar area seemed quite busy. I had a drink from their decent selection, but nothing to eat. However, lots of people around me seemed to enjoy their food and it looked good. Both meal times seemed to come with great service. 

I didn't see the pool of the exercise room. Parking was $12/day. 

Really a very nice hotel, and whenever the Marriott is too expensive, I'll take the Fairfield no problem."}
{"text":"The Fairfield Inn at the Montreal Airport (YUL) is a very good value in my opinion. I am a Marriott fan-boy at the Platinum Rewards level and stay in Marriott family hotels over 100 nights a year. This particular hotel is a standout in the Fairfield \"value\" branch of the company because: 1. The hotel has been recently remodeled and is really fresh and updated throughout; 2. The staff is always right on top of everything and is sincerely friendly; 3. If you are new to town, the location is very close to the airport (about 3 minutes from the car rental area) and has access to the highways; 4. The breakfast area is even better kept than the usually well kept Fairfields I've been to before - for instance they have TWO waffle irons instead of the usual one to allow for speed. Now, truth be know, I would normally stay at the Residence Inn while here, but due to Grand Prix week I could not get my normal corporate rate there and so used the Marriott.com website to find an alternate and came up with this one. I am considering making the change permanent because this hotel is so nice for the much lower price. My upgraded king suite has a 42\" flat panel TV, sofa, separated bed area, etc. The exercise room has two treadmills, stairmaster and an elliptical trainer. One small gripe: the weight set is just dumbells and only goes up to 35#, which is not enough even for me and I'm old but small. Speaking of small, the indoor pool is probably less than 25' long. It's not a great lap pool. However, the exercise machines not only are well kept but have personal HDTVs per machine. Pretty nice! The hotel also has a bar that can serve meals at night, too. Not extensive, but enough to keep me happy if I don't get out for dinner - and a great bar tender to go with it.

So, why is this hotel only $119 or so a night? I think because it is near YUL. I don't have a problem with noise, and I don't think this is a noisy hotel anyways. However, you can hear the occasional plane even thought the rooms are well insulated. Once again, I don't think it's an issue, but you might if you are super sensitive. 

So, this is definitely five star for the price in a big city area like Montreal. I say, go for it if the location suits."}
{"text":"We have had many occasions to stay here during visits to Montreal.  Always a very accommodating experience.  The facility is quite new and up to date with regards to furnishing HVAC and television.  It's decently soundproofed from the inevitable noise associated with being located next to 6 railway lines (that are busy - 24/7/365) and an international airport that makes it's own brand of noise.

The service at the front desk is exceptional, and housekeeping is prompt, polite and excellent.  Very reasonable price and generous room size.  Decent internet (dependable) at no charge and the free breakfast is adequate and nighttime dining appears to be fine, but I've not personally experienced.

I would recommend you ask for an odd numbered room (faces away from the railway lines), as it will be quieter.  $12/day for parking your car, so also keep that in mind.

Shuttle service from the airport was dependable and ran on time.  No complaints.

Would recommend."}
