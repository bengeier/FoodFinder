{"text":"My favourite Vietnamese restaurant downtown would have to be Saigon Y2K. Where else can you get a gut-busting lunch in Calgary for under $10, all while eating in plain sight of a golden Buddha?  The focus at Saigon Y2K is definitely the weekday lunch crowd - the place is always packed at noon, so I recommend making a reservation. They do dine in, take out, and even delivery, but they are only open Monday to Saturday from 11:00am - 8:00pm, so don't count on it for your Sunday family dinner.  The menu is huge -105 items to be exact - but I always order the same thing: 53c, which is charbroiled seasoned chicken rice vermicelli with spring rolls -Yum!  As per most Vietnamese places, the mixing-bowl sized meal of noodles arrives in about 5 minutes, and a variety of sauces are already on the table for you to make your own creation. The welcoming complimentary pot of green tea is also a nice touch, but if you prefer to be \"self-marinating\", they have beer, wine and cocktails to go with your meal."}
{"text":"Feels like walking into time-warp 1980s video-game land with poor decor, poor food, and less than enthusiastic staff. Skinny shrimp rolls, oddly prepared Pho (too much peanut broth in a dish where clear broth is the requirement)... this place is all kinds of backwards."}
{"text":"Saigon Y2K should be So Long Y2K     I couldn't decide what to eat, the BBQ at Happy Valley lured me in but the possibility that this restaurant has been around for more than 14 years won over. After all, nobody adds Y2K to anything since before 1999.    The restaurant was dirty, dark and dingy, but as a risk taker, I was willing to go along with this. There had to be a reason why it was still in business for all these years. Perhaps, I was faulty in thinking the food would explode with flavor in my mouth and start doing the lambada. As a person, who has worked in these types of restaurants, I had no fear but then again, I've seen better restaurants than this have some sort of pest infestation.    Unfortunately, I got into an argument over why they couldn't serve fried noodles the Chinese way, soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. I even gave them the procedure and offered to cook it myself, as I am no stranger to teaching Asian cooking classes. However, the bottom line that I was told in no uncertain terms is that they are NOT a Chinese restaurant but a Vietnamese restaurant; however, their menu would suggest otherwise. I didn't feel I should point this out. Then again, perhaps, they didn't want me to see the conditions in the kitchen.    To be quite honest, none of the dishes on the menu really suggested to me Vietnamese, other than the Pho and Vermicelli. Really Quail? Beef and Broccoli? Do they even grow Broccoli in Vietnam?    In the end, I took the lady's recommendation, which was the Stir Fried Assorted Meat & Seafood with Mixed Vegetables bedded on Steam Rice. Meat = Chicken, Beef. Seafood = 3 shrimps. Vegetables = onions, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and celery.    When the dish came out, I was surprised at how big it was. The first initial bites were positive, but then, I noticed that the cauliflower was dirty and the rice was almost non-existent. Atkin's people rejoice, you can eat here. The sauce was flavourful but runny. It was like no care was taken in preparing the food, which is a real disappointment.    The Soya milk was sweet and refreshing. Thankfully, you can't screw that up. What did surprise me was that there was no ice in it. So, as others have stated, this restaurant does get me on portion sizes.    Finally, she cashed me out and was happy to take my money. Business owners, you're going to want to pay attention to this. I had to wait because the machine was not charged, and it would take 2 minutes to get a sufficient charge. I paid by credit card but wouldn't you know it, her machine misprinted and you couldn't see half of my bill. Her attitude was very cavalier in that she would not print the bill over again. Most people would change the paper and reprint my bill, not her.    So, I am left with...a bad taste in my mouth. I will not be going here again, EVER! If it makes it another 14 years, I will not be stupid enough to eat here again. I think I will be at Happy Valley."}
{"text":"Not sure how long this place has been in business in this particular China Town location but I have been going here for at least 10 years when I'm in the area. It never disappoints. The decor is outdated but don't let that sway you since the food is great, prices reasonable and it's always fast - no matter the time of day your here.  There is so many lunch time FAV's that I find it hard to just pick one when I pop in. The pho, vermicelli dishes, rice dishes, noodles and on and on. On this occasion I had the vermicelli lemon grass beef. It was soooo good. Beef was tender and the perfect amount of spice.  During the lunch hour, the place is always packed, but if you go a little before or after peak time than it's easy to get a seat. The service is always very fast, friendly servers and prices are very economical. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Their crispy noodle nest thing is sooooo good. I never know just what it is called, but yum. I'm also a big fan of the Imperial Rolls, and the pho is pretty yummy. Saigon Y2K does price up a little bit compared to the other noodle houses in the vicinity. I do like the Ambiance a bit better, and it has a great view of the sidewalk and the street.  During the lunch hour, the place is always packed, but if you go a little before or after it is easy to get a decent seat. The service is always very fast and efficient, which I definitely appreciated on a tight schedule.   I wish that the menu would explain some of the dishes better. I once ordered the pork spring rolls, and to my surprise they were pork salad rolls! That is, they were cold pork on a bed of vermicelli and lettuce, and the wrapped in a thin rice wrapper. I was not pleasantly shocked, but I did my best to eat it anyways. It just wasn't very appetizing, although I do enjoy shrimp salad rolls a lot. This has happened a couple of times, so I recommend clarifying what you are ordering if you are not totally sure."}
{"text":"Right by Chinatown, so would've thought it would be quite authentic, with Vietnamese ladies, but surprisingly a good mix.  Just got off the plane, so my natural instincts:  ice coffee and pho.  But seeing that I had another client meeting at an Indian buffet @ Royal India a block away, I played it safe, the guaranteed winner, salad rolls.  A unique twist: the lettuce was chopped ever so fine, so forgot that there was supposed to be vermicelli ;)  Prawns nicely cut, even removing the black part, bonus.  Ice coffee passed the test, a bit bigger than normal.  Amex, yah, a first for a Vietnamese lol.  Booth seating on the left.  Clean, spacious washrooms in the basement."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Taste is not bad only issue I have is that they are very skimpy on the meat if you ordered number 27 rare beef pho. The place is located in Chinatown. Its not super busy during lunch time. Especially when they are in a good location being so close to offices, is definitely not a good sign. Service is good.   Taste is ok. If you are talking about flavor and portion, its better to go to their competitor located inside a mall near by. If you re talking about cleanliness and sanitation. Its not bad. Yes the place is outdated but at least their cups and plates and bowls were clean.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"It was decent- but the service didn't blow my skirt up or anything. It was cheap and average. Lots of tv's...so not a real intimate space."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I am not a Pho snob, so my expectations when going out for Vietnamese are pretty open ended.  I dropped by here with two really good looking ladies on a Tuesday night. We were all really, really hungry.  The place was deader than Michael Jackson and a nice (but very quiet) hostess showed up and told us we could sit wherever we want. I like that kind of choice. I find it empowering. We grabbed a booth near the back and dove into their menu.  The decor is pretty cheesy, but endearing. The place was really clean. There are big neon signs that say \"enjoy your meal\" and the windows have neon lights too. I'm partial to neon, so that was a big hit. The gorgeous ladies I was with didn't seem to share my enthusiasm for them.  I had Vermicelli, Shredded Pork, Not-Shredded Pork and Spring Rolls. The food arrived shortly - a big, steaming bowl of delicious noodles, meat, sprouts, all kinds of   vietnamese wonders. I doused that bad boy in hot sauce, whatever the heck that brown sauce is and to top it off - the fish sauce.  I began shoving it in my face enthusiastically.  The spring rolls were great. The pork was great. The noodles were noodley.  I got way more fish sauce than the incredibly good looking ladies did, but that's okay. They didn't seem to mind.  My non-existant expectations were met. I'd go here again, probably under similar circumstances. I hear this place gets packed out at lunch times, so maybe the service is bad then.  But as one of three groups in the restaurant, we were treated pretty well - minus the fact that for some reason they didn't bring us water; only tea. I mean, hold the phone for a second. Giving your patrons water is pretty much par the course for every single restaurant in the world, isn't it? Not getting water isn't enough to make me hate a place, and it came when we asked for it.  One of my extremely attractive lady friends voiced her concern that her satay pho was not actually very spicy at all. We debated the physics of hot sauce and whether it was all settling on the bottom, but then decided we didn't really care; she just wished it was spicier.   Well, she's pretty spicy herself, so I can see how she would demand a spicy dish equivalent. Did I mention I went to dinner with multiple good looking women? Probably. But that's not the point of this review.  Anyways, if you're hungry for Viet on a Tuesday, this place is worth dropping into. Bring your hot friends."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why some of the people on here complain of \"bad service,\" because my wife (soon) and I go there all the time and have had no complaints in that regard. From our first visit to our most recent, they've accommodated us.  And I mean that.   I'm a picky eater - it's nothing against anyone's food, I just have certain preferences. Preferences that most think are weird. That said, they literally strain the broth because they know that - while I love the flavour - I don't like onions and the like floating around in my soup (any soup). I don't even have to ask anymore. That's great service right there, no?  So yeah, not sure where all these complaints are coming from. The interior is so open, there's literally no way the staff won't see you.  Anyway, that Broth though. Delicious. Get the classic Satê Beef, or Satê Seafood.  Even if you hate the service like these other people, just use Skipthedishes. That way you can just \"skip the service\" that these guys hate so much and get to that Satê Broth, pronto.  Also, the salad rolls are great.  And also, the Skewers are great.  Oh yeah and also, the Vermicelli dishes are great.  Also, can't forget, the Avacado Shake is great.  Again, can't speak for everyone about the service - for us it's great. But don't go for the service; go for the food."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago.  The main cook was serving as the host was on break. He was so nice and polite.  He recommend a spicy beef pho.  It was so flavourful and amazing.  I'm excited to go back again soon.  The place was inviting, clean and the atmosphere was all around fantastic.  Thanks."}
