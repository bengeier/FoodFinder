{"text":"The best place for pizza and wings.  Great service as well.  The anti pasta is my favorite."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant, friendly staff, and reasonable pricing. Got the steak and cheese, a little to much bun and not enough meat for my liking but still tasted good. Il give their pizza and salad a try next."}
{"text":"My family loves Grande Pizza.  They are family owned and so nice.  The pizza is NYC style, thin crust/big slices and it is delicious!!  Barron's was our previous go to for pizza but since we found Grande we always order from there now."}
{"text":"I've tried this place quite a few times and nothing changes even though I keep hearing how great it is.   The steak hoagies are ok. Italian is good. but other than that... The owner is rude. Some of the employees are too, which probably explains why there's always a Help Wanted sign in the window.  I had hoped with the new location things would change."}
{"text":"I love Grande Pizza!I have only eaten here a few times,but it was awesome! The pizza is good old fashioned east coast style.IE:big and tasty with thick crust. The service is always friendly and professional,and the place is run by real Italians so they really know thier stuff. The inside reminds me of the good ol pizza and sub shops that i used to frequent back east.Walk in,order,pay,then either sit in a booth or take the food to go. No annoying fast food atmosphere,no having to talk to waiters if you're not in the mood,just good quality pizza from a well run establishment.They also have subs,salads,and italian dinners on the menu.I have only had the pizza so far because it's soooo good. The location is a little hidden.Its in a strip mall near a gym and a filibertos on91st.ave. and union hills,but it is definately some of the best pizza in Arizona."}
{"text":"went there ordered lasagna. should have gone to safeway or fry's  and bought stouffers would have tasted better. Eggplant black and burnt and greasy, pizza crust soggy and sausage  on the pizza was loaded with fat and grease. Not an Italian place don't know how to cook Italian food. Most people like Italian food and go there thinking they are going to get that kind of good food. Trust me don't waste your time. food was not good at all. If there was a half a star rating that's what I would rate them. Read the other reviews  we can't all be wrong. They are not Italian. We will not be going back"}
{"text":"Don't order the subs.  I'm so disappointed. I went in to order a sub. I asked for ham and provolone. No provolone. Ever. What Italian place doesn't have provolone? The girl at the counter never asked me what I wanted on my sub so I asked what it comes with. Lettuce, tomato, onion, and Italian vinaigrette.  That sounded fine, although I wasn't used to not being able to choose my own toppings including what type of cheese I want. The sub was disappointing. It was mostly bread (which was good), only 2 slices of ham, one slice of cheese, chunky tomatoes (fresh) and this Cheap Italian dressing. The thick yellow kind. Disgusting. I was so disappointed. I didn't even finish the sub. All I could taste was bread and cheap Italian dressing. I want to support our local business owners, but there's high end pizza chains in the area that deliver a higher quality product with the ability to customize. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"went in for the two slice special..a fresh pie was just coming out of the oven so I thought I was in luck..i had sausage added and it smelled kinda funny on the way home ..after a few bites it tasted a little sour YUK.. I have given them several tries since the old owner is back..done! never again!!"}
{"text":"Heard there was new owners. Waited 90 mins for pizza tonight. No apology for slow service. Pizza wasn't anywhere near as good as it was last time I was here. They shouldn't have taken our order if the couldn't accommodate it. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The owner and employees are extremely friendly and gregarious! The prices are great for high quality food! Definitely cannot be disappointed here. :) The pizza is always hot and fresh, the crust being light and having the perfect crunch. The atmosphere is light and the store is well maintained."}
{"text":"Update.  I still order this every Sunday for football!!  This place is killer!!  Pizza is the best in town and wings are always the Topps,  you won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"We saw the original owner was back so we figured we would try out the pizza.  We were very disappointed in the food. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great pizza, wings and service. There are a ton of other pizza joints in the area, but since trying Grande, it's the only one we frequent now."}
{"text":"Best pizza and food around true mom and pop pizzeria. Very good can not say enough how good it really is."}
{"text":"Great for takeout! The steak special hoagie is delicious. I also enjoy the pepperoni mushroom calzone. This place has fresh, home made, authentic food. I definitely recommend it to all."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating there lunch they always  get me in and out. the pizza is amazing and love their hogie sandwich I highly recommend you to try them!"}
{"text":"Overall I'm a fan of their pizza. Nice thin crust, sauce has a good taste, and the toppings were plentiful and fresh. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Perfect pizza & I eat pizza twice everyday. I love how they have the perfect amount of everything on it."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the area! The owner and daughters are always friendly. Many items on the menu are great! Crust is perfect and even has a bit of a crunch. Perfect ratio of sauce and cheese. Both my husband (Italian) and myself were raised in Jersey and upstate New York and this reminds us of that kind of pizza. Just be careful as you will get hooked!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing taste! Great Pizza! Better than New York City itself, (my opinion)! Wings couldn't be more perfect! Lightly fried, sauce was perfect!"}
{"text":"The worst thing I can say is that since we discovered Grande, my wife and kids won't let me get pizza from anywhere else anymore.  Not only that, they loved it so much that they don't want to try anything else so I haven't had my chance to try everything on the menu like I usually do when I find somewhere new.  The pizza is more of a Philly style than anything.  It's thin, soft crust and very greasy, so if you ever ate at a neighborhood pizzeria on the East Coast, you're probably familiar with it.  It's terrible for your arteries, but you eat 5 pieces before you even realize it because it's so good.  The wings are traditional Buffalo style, which again is really bad for you but is identical to what you get in a lot of places in western New York.  I did get to try a sandwich they had as a lunch special once as well, and it's great, full of meat and fresh cheese.  I grew up outside of Buffalo and Philly, so everything at Grande tastes just like what I remember from my youth.  I do love a nice, fat, stuffed pizza but I've had to give up on that for the time being since my wife's wings and my sons' pizza is at Grande, which also works out just fine because it's AWESOME."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Grande who were high endorsed for their delicious pizza.  There is room to dine in with wait service available, and I saw many people came in to pick up take out. This quaint restaurant has a full menu complete with Italian dinners, pizza, wings, apps etc... We ordered the breadsticks and a large neapolitan pizza with green peppers and bacon. First class! The presentation was what I noticed right away. They used both red and green peppers; there was ample bacon and just enough cheese. My pizza also wasn't swimming in sauce and the crust was crispy but not under cooked. Priced fairly I would order from here again. I would really like to try one of their specialty pizzas. Two enthusiastic thumbs up."}
{"text":"Don't let the name Grande Pizza fool you, as good as the pizza is here, the other dishes are even better. I am from NY and am very picky with my Italian food, this is the best Italian food in the West Valley. Since I have moved to AZ, I will only eat Italian food if I make it because I have not found a good Italian restaurant until now. I love Grande Pizza for Italian food and you will love it too. This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Wow, the best pizza I had eaten.  Great pizza, simple and fast.  Take a bow Grande.  The menu has a lot of great food.  Meatballs are excellent. My wife's favorite"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials at just $5.99. Salads, chicken wings, and pizza all good.  Young staff could not be accommodating."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and wings!! Awesome people work there. My family and I went there during Christmas and gave my daughters Christmas gifts. They do this every year around Christmas! They give out gifts to the kids! Food and price are great. I highly recommend this place for its food but also for their outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Mushrooms are from a can. The peppers were not fresh. For a large pizza with three toppings that cost eighteen dollars?! Never again."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and consistent. The wait staff is terrible.  Always has been.  Last night was the last time I'll eat in.  Strongly recommend takeout."}
{"text":"Best pizza Hands down!!! They also have a very good hot sausage sandwich."}
{"text":"I live in the community of Vistancia and I am much like one of the other reviewers, I want good local food.  Local is sort of a misnomer but if you know Vistancia or live in Vistancia, you know that it is slightly tucked away and only have a couple of \"local\" restaurants.  Grande Pizza is one of them.  I like their pizza on the whole but the ingredients on the pizza can sometimes be lacking.  For instance I think the meat products like the sausage and pepperoni are good to go but their vegetables are only so so and sometimes just wrong like the mushrooms (previously mentioned but I do need to second the notion).  I do really like the wings though.  They are cooked well and the sauce is fairly good.  Wings can be done much worse and these are higher in my book.  What, may I ask, is with $1.00 refills?  I am okay with $.25 or even $.50 refills but $1.00?  I teeter between buying one gigantic drink and just refilling it with the whole family on most occasions.  Now with the ranch...  I am one of those guys who dips his pizza in ranch.  For the life of me I don't understand why Grande Pizza uses this particular ranch.  At best it is good enough for salad but should not be anywhere near pizza or wings.  I personally like the thick creamy ranch where this ranch is the soupy tangy ranch.  Not good enough to dip in really.  The inside is nice and very pizzeria style with a couple of tv's that inexplicably always have sports on.  Pretty much standard fair there.  Benches and tables for the hungry as well.  I guess booths along the walls would be nice but there isn't much you can ask for in a joint like this.   Overall, I do have to say I am happy with the service which should take mention because it looks to be mostly a family run operation.  They do like to please and were very nice each time I have visited them.  I will go back again but I am willing to go down the road to Barro's more and more for their wonderful pizza and wings with awesome ranch.  The opportunity for this restaurant is barely tapped in this community and with the right tweaks they could be filling seats every evening."}
{"text":"The owner is so friendly and happy to have you as his customer.  We get the pizza and wings special.  The wings have plenty of meat and sauce.  We love spicy food and the mild is the perfect amount of heat.  It's great to go into a restaurant and know that they truly appreciate you being their customer"}
{"text":"Food is OK not great. Service is the issue. Friday is pizza night in our house...every Friday. We ordered one week from here and after returning home from picking up the order I realized they forgot a Stromboli. I called they found it on the oven and apologized and said they would give us one free next order. Two weeks later I called to order and told them about the past mix up. I was told they only keep notes on the subject for one week and basically I was SOL. So instead of them being in our monthly rotation they are out for good! For what $8 vs good customer service!?"}
{"text":"I think their pizza is the best. Love the thin crust. Their jalapeno poppers are awesome too. The best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The restaurant is exactly what you would expect from a family owned pizza place. We only ordered wings and were really disappointed. The wings were so small, we really felt let down. The flavor was decent. We agreed they probably use Frank's sauce. Also ordered well done and didn't get it. I wish it was better. We live close and this would have been a great replacement for our usual wing place farther away."}
{"text":"Went in to get a pizza and was told it was a hour and a half wait WTF for a pizza    not,  Got a hoagie  instead .  A pretty good Italian.  There new restaurant in small and nice,  When its packed its hard to walk back to your table, the pick up line clogs up the walking path.   I like the pizza  but there are other as good and without the major wait."}
{"text":"So I Met a Friend Here For Lunch, Wanted to Give it a Try, Since Its Not Too Far From Work.  They Have Amazing Lunch Specials, For Cheap!!!   I Got a Slice of Pep Pizza & 5 Hot Wings & Lg Drink for $7.50!!  I Am Very Picky About My Wings, And These Are in My Top 3 Now.  They Were Cooked Crispy, and Lots of Tasty Wing Sauce!!  Not To Mention The Staff Was Very Friendly!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch by myself one day. It turned out to be a long lunch. The calzone that I ordered was ok, not great and not horrible. It took about 30 mins for my food to come out. What really disappointed me was the fact that the owner turned down a lady who came in looking for a donation for a community sports team. After she left he made fun of her to another customer."}
{"text":"Still looking for a great pizza place.. We ordered hawaiian pizza wings and breaded mushrooms. They even threw in a big helping of grease for free. Pizza  was thin and flimsy ( probably from all the grease). Wings were really small and sitting in grease not crunchy, not what we were expecting and the mushrooms were okay. Taste of the food was good. But not worth comming back and trying again unfortunately it seems like a nice place, other then the big wiffs of cigarette smoke i kept smelling that was a little overpowering."}
{"text":"An NHT staple. Used to be right next to Natale's Sporting Goods. I'd used to buy sweet looking sweatpants back in the 80's at Natale's and then go over to Grande's and get a slice. Nothing beat it.   I just ordered a pie today and it's exactly how I remembered it. Crisp crust, great cheese and just overall great consistency. I live out in Murrysville now so it's hard to get back there but whenever I'm in town I like to hit up all the old spots and Grande's tops the list!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! And the gluten free pizza is phenomenal!! Love the wings, the zucchini and the antipasto salads! Local and independently owned makes it even easier for Grande to be my favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! THE...BEST white pizza around!! YUM!! And super friendly people. Their location is a good size, a little dated but that doesn't really matter. I have tried several of their pizzas, and they all are really good but always go back for their white pizza. That heavy garlic and no red sauce is PERFECT. Located in a nice strip mall. I always appreciate the quick service, and when I call in for a pick up order, my stuff is always ready and waiting for me to pick it up."}
{"text":"After NYPD pizza off Union Hills closed, I needed to find another pizza restaurant close to home and so glad I found this one. Their pizza is the best. They never skimp on the toppings and the crust it perfect, nice and toasty, not too thick and not to thin. Just the way I like it. Wish I had tried this place sooner."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Bound!  Part V  I moved to Atlanta in December of last year from Pittsburgh and had yet to be back.  Virtually every Labor Day weekend of my entire life was spent in Pittsburgh with my parents, as my birthday falls within the window.  I promised my folks that I would make a long weekend out of it, and head on home.  The following reviews are a step-by-step account of the long weekend.  Enjoy!  (For Part IV, go to: yelp.com/review_share/9n...)  JD called and asked what I was doing for lunch.  J and I have been friends for nearly 25 years and I was back for a short trip, so he wanted to meet up.  I told him that I had nothing going on and suggested Grande's.  I hadn't been to Grande's in a while, but I figured that if I was home, I was going to get pizza.  When I was a kid, my parents would neglect my brothers and me and hire a makeshift babysitter to watch us while they trounced around town like the harlequins that they are.  Just before the babysitter would come over, my dad would swing by Grande's and pick up a few large pizzas as an up-front payment for us having to deal with some pockmarked teenage douche whose sole responsibility was to make sure me and the boys didn't set the house on fire.  We hated having a babysitter, but it was all worth it for the pizza.  Any kid loves pizza, but Grande was different.  They actually put meatballs on the pizza.  Meatballs!!!  As a kid, all I ever knew about pizza was pepperoni and some vegetables I didn't like.  Meatballs were a foreign concept to us and we loved it.    It wasn't only the fact that these guys were bucking the system with this outside-the-box meatball concept (fast forward 30 years and I can probably find a place that would top a pizza with pancakes and sushi), but it wasn't some gimmicky thing.  The pizza was incredibly good.  Soft, chew dough, a sauce that wasn't overly salty or sweet, and quality cheese.  My Italian grandmother once showed me the difference between plastic cheese and real cheese, and it was a lesson that I've always retained.  30 years later, and the pizza is still as good as ever.  How many restaurants have you gone to where you can honestly allow three decades to pass and not say \"It's not as good as it used to be\"?  The Grande's of the world are hard to come by.  If there are three things us Pittsburghers revel in, it's our championships, rampant alcoholism, and pizza.  I've lived in a variety of areas around the country, and nothing has ever come close to reminding me of the pizza from home.  I've found a few places in Atlanta that come damn close, but Pittsburgh pizza will always be number one, and Grande is in the top of that list.  (For part VI, go to: yelp.com/review_share/af...)"}
{"text":"Fantastic veggie pizza , service and food +10. Old time family local business you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The cheese pizza was very good. Perfect crust. Wings aren't bad either. Good deal too with the large and 20 wings."}
{"text":"Our \"go to\" place had closed and we found Grande in Yelp.  The pizza was large and tasty and the wings were very good.  It was early on a Saturday night when we arrived and it picked up pretty quick.  They do charge $.50 for soda refills.  I understand, especially being an independent business.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We walked in, the waiter was talking to someone and ignoring us as we waited to get out menus. I got up, thinking that I had to get the menu... No no, he just had to converse with whoever. Finally the person he was talking to decided to end their conversation. Then he brings our menu. My daughter and I split a medium pizza, she got a lemonade and I got a water with lemon. The bill (after I've given him my card) has an extra charge.. One charge for the pizza, one for the lemonade  and $1.50 or $1.99 for what? The water? The lemon? Sharing the pizza? Sitting fee? I didn't mention it but it's strange.  The pizza was okay."}
{"text":"I typically don't go out of my way for pizza. Today I had my son and niece and nephew and they wanted pizza after Wet N Wild.  Holy moly hands down the best pizza I've ever had! And the wings are delicious! Im pretty picky about wings and these did not disappoint.   We all left with happy belly's."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and wing deal and got a great price and the wings were crispy as heck.  I loved it baby!"}
{"text":"First bite into the pizza, and the bottom of the pizza is really chewy.  Alas, they freeze their dough.  Despite this, I ate the next piece and it was not of the same consistency, and quite good.  Overall, not bad pizza.  However, they really should be careful with how they freeze/refrigerate their dough."}
{"text":"I have been here twice while working in Vistancia.  It's a typical \"order at the counter and then they bring out the food too you\" AZ eatery.    On the first visit we ordered the Grande pizza (their supreme) and it was quite tasty.  The service was mediocre but my company was quite entertaining.  The second time I opted to eat here I decided on the sausage sub and my coworker had the roast beef sub.  I was less impressed the second time around as they skimped on the meat.  My sub was mainly bread; soggy bread from all the sauce and my co workers sub only had 1 thin layer of roast beef but was loaded down with lettuce and cheese.  Now I know we are in a depression but please don't get so cheap with your portions.  We spent $5.50/person for this \"lunch special\".  My advice:  If you come here don't get a sub.  Just go for the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is just okay; their strombolis and salads are my favorite. I especially love the homemade Italian dressing. Since the move from one section of Norwin Towne Square to another (due to the sale of the lot and construction)...the place just isn't what it used to be. I don't like the new set up...people who come in to pick up to-go orders are in the middle of the restaurant and it's awkward.   My last experience with Grande's, however, has made it my last. My parents were visiting and we decided to order pizza from there. I called and spoke to a (very) young girl. I ordered 1 medium pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms and 1 medium white pizza. She asked me my name and I had to stop her from hanging up in order to ask how long until it would be ready. (They do not deliver so pick up is the only option).  Well....my husband and dad went and picked up our order and, to our dismay, found 1 med with pepperoni and mushrooms and 1 plain pizza....boo. I called up and got the same teenage girl, who was totally clueless. She asked me to wait a minute, held the phone away from her and yelled to one of the cooks (who I believe is a co-owner), reiterating my story to her about the pizza discrepancy.   His reply....\"So what?!\"       Really? So she gets back on the phone, in which I tell her I could hear their entire conversation and I want my white pizza, like I ordered. She tells me to hold on again.  Now another person gets on the phone...a older woman. Ah, finally I thought. Ummm not so much. I again retell the story of how I ordered two pizzas - one with pepperoni and mushrooms and one white pizza. To my dismay, we go a plain cheese pizza instead. Not to mention that I was concerned we were charged for something we didn't get (since a white pizza would be the more expensive of the two).  She says \"Well, your tickets says a plain pizza.\" I say, \"Well, it's not my fault the girl wrote it down wrong.\" As if I'm lying about the whole pizza ordeal....like it's some big scandal. Girl goes around ordering the wrong pie in order to wreak havok on local business owners.  The lady's solution is to tell me she will make me a white pizza, which of course we would have to go back out and pick up. Oh, and I was to bring the plain pizza back AND pay for the difference between the cost of a white pizza and a plain pizza. I asked if this was her idea of customer service and their only \"solution\". She says yes. I say, \"(Expletive) Forget It\" and hang up.  Poor customer service, new restaurant not as nice as the old one, way better Italian places in the area = lack of Leslie's business. 2 stars probably generous."}
{"text":"Steve the owner is great! It's a family atmosphere which you simply can't beat. It reminds me of growing up back east. I'm there a few times a week!"}
{"text":"I just didn't like the pizza. It was still doughy like it hadnt been left in long enough. Staff was just rude. I really don't like this place. Should've payed attention to the \"unrecommended\" comments."}
{"text":"Parking is horrible, you're better off parking at the lower lot of the club house and walking over. You can eat in or take out. We ate in.  Waitress was nice. Restaurant is clean enough, as are the bathrooms. We call our food ahead so we don't have to wait.  The garlic knots are really good. The pizza is just okay. There's not enough sauce on it for me. The crust is flimsy as it gets. It doesn't reheat well in the microwave if you're someone who likes leftovers (we do). It's soggy and bleh.  The worst part about Grande is it's extremely expensive. It was $80 for 2 large & 2 medium pizzas. That is insane for how underwhelming the pizza is.  We will go elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Grande's pizza was essentially the only pizza I knew existed growing up.  There was no other.  So I have a fondness for Grande's and their pizza - it's always been delicious. Not to mention there's nothing better than cold pizza for breakfast...an Italian pastry!  Their sauce is also the closest to my family's recipe.  The gnocchi is delicious in it, and if you order it as a dinner, you also get a salad or soup and bread.  It's very good.  The gyros and stromboli are also pretty good, much like your standard fare.  The only complaint I have is the service...it's so slow.  I've gone there so many times now and it's just so slow, all of the time, that it's no longer one of my favorite lunch/dinner places.  I would recommend this place because it is good food and a local family business.  But if you can't tolerate waiting awhile (over 30 mins) for your food, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"I've gone to Grandes most of my life and the food is excellent. Last night we went to the Free Santa event they had and it was a blast! So many family's and kids were there and the Santa was so nice. They even handed out toys to all the kids! My girls were so excited. Thank you guys for a great event!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place hearing that they are from Italy. but i really dont have much to say about it. I had a regular cheese pizza and my best way to explain it would be it seemed watered down or watery if that makes since. I also didnt care for the cheesebread :-("}
{"text":"I don't come this far west very often but found myself in need of lunch. Pulled up Yelp to find a good place to get a slice. Settled on this location. I was underwhelmed. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and bell pepper and one sausage and bell pepper. 1st, the bell pepper is pickled I think. Some people like that on pizza, I don't. There seemed to be very little cheese and sauce. A major sign of a great slice of pizza is the sauce and cheese. You want there to be enough cheese that when you take a bite it's stringy and delicious. These slices were neither of those things. I wouldn't recommend based on these things. On the positive the crust was delish. Too bad nothing else was good about it."}
{"text":"Wish I could write them a good review but the pizza was not very good, the mushrooms were canned and tasted terrible.  The ranch was just gross, I want places near my home to be good and I should give them just 1 star but I want them to get better.  I have been here twice now and even the chicken wings were not very good and with the ranch it was just a bad idea."}
{"text":"Best pizza place In the state ! My favorite is the wings :) Everyone inside is so nice and respectful. I love this place it feels like home. Superbowl they also have amazing deals! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and was blown away by the service that was provided. I cannot believe how kind and genuinely friendly the owner and daughters were. We ordered a jumbo half sausage/pepperoni and wings. Everything was phenomenal and really packed the flavor. The inside is a perfect size with two tv's and many booths, there is also an outside patio. They serve beer and wine and many options besides pizza. I loved this place and felt like I was part of the pizza family. I will definitely be back and you should absolutely give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and every time excellent pizza and even better wings... and what great food without excellent service!!! Steve and his crew make me feel like family!!"}
{"text":"PIZZA NAZI!!!!! Is Grande's Pizza Good? Yes, It's magical! Hands down--the best! Well, then why would I take the time to write a \"bad\" review? Because my family and I have been loyal, regular customers for over 25 years, and I'm upset with the way I was treated there recently. This past Friday I ordered 2 Pizza's(a Sicilian and a regular) and when ordering the girl took my name, phone number and gave me an order number and told me it would be ready in 50 minutes. To make a long story short, I went to pick up my pizzas and the kid working said it wasn't there. I told him what time I ordered, what it was that I ordered and gave him my order #. He told the owner who then told him to check the slips....they said it wasn't there. I then asked what we could do, because I was taking this order to a party. The owner just stared at me, not saying a word....no offer to put the order in....no apology...nothing....NO PIZZA FOR ME!!!! This does sadden me because I've had very fond memories of Grande's over the past many years. I decided to call the next day, when it was not so busy and asked to speak to the owner. The woman answering the phone would not put him on and she said she was the \"manager\"....I explained what happened and she took my name and number and said she'd look into it. I never received a return call. As good as their pie is, I will not patronize a place that could care less about a valued, loyal, regular customer"}
{"text":"As a kid growing up in Brooklyn N.Y.. I love good pizza! A knife and fork..no way. I like my pizza dripping in cheese and oil and a large enough slice to be able to fold up and chow down. I was so disappointed when Grandes closed on Union Hills. I know there is a family thing going on with a few of our side pizza placed..and all have that yummy N.Y. Thing going...but Grandes was close to home... And they even has added delivery. Anyways...pulled into what had become Young Bothers....only to see Steve and Grande is BC,!!! I am a happy Brooklynite again!! Ciao .....gimme a slice!! ...oh..and the eggplant parm is amazing. All hot dishes baked in little casseroles so the mozzarella gets brown in the oven... That's the way!!"}
{"text":"I found this place in 89, moved down here go to school my friends and I were out on a space cruise to be honest we had no idea where we were. We were all new to town saw Grande Pizza stopped in and had the best pizza I've ever had moved back home for 16 years then moved back and have been searching for this place ever since. . Okay the pizza crust is better than Famous Rays in NYC, the sauce is tangy marries perfectly with the toppings all of which are top quality the staff are amazing ambience yeah well it's like NYC ya want good pizza not a fancy place to eat sub par pizza. Grande Pizza thank you for being you.... Check this place out Grande special is the way to go....nom nom."}
{"text":"Basically......they are the most rude business owners you will ever meet.   I bought a pizza, was given my recipt and told to wait for about 20 min.    After about 30 min I inquired about the status of my pizza.    I gave the name it was under and the owner said here it is and presented it to me.   He gave me the total for the pizza.  I told him I already paid and here is the receipt for it.    He than began to question me about the pizza, did I really order it, etc.    I held up the receipt and told him to give me the pizza.   Eventually he did.    What bothers me about this place is it used to be good.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. We switch between a few pizza places in the area (Bruno's, Pasquale's, and here). We have never had a bad pizza here or had to wait too long. However, I have never eaten in the restaurant - always done takeout. We also get their crust to make our own pizza at home. This is a good, solid pizza that never disappoints."}
{"text":"Kind of a late post, but my daughters birthday was celebrated on 3/3/18. She wanted to do a build a bear birthday at the mall and after eat pizza. I didn't want to go to Peter Piper or some place that was going to be crazy packed. So I looked on Yelp for a place near the mall. I found this place and it had tons of good reviews. So I decided to try it out. First I called them and asked if they would allow me to leave he cake there so we didn't have to cart it around at build a bear and through the mall. They was so gracious to allow me to leave it there before going to the mall. When I dropped the cake off, Steve asked how many people would we be expecting. When we came back they had an area ready for our party. They were so welcoming, friendly, accommodating and wonderful all around. To top it off the food was delicious and very reasonably priced. We don't live close to Grande Pizza, but because of the service and the experience we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The Grande thin crust pizza reminds me of pizza from the Wildwood NJ boardwalk....I love the Grande Special and regularly pick up a large pepperoni... I have never eaten in, but it's my favorite take-out pizza in the area. The owners (I assume that's who the older gentlemen there are) seem nice enough and like soccer (always make small talk) so I recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"I was house sitting near here so I thought I would give this place a chance.  The pizza was amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here this weekend as I love wings and am always on the lookout for a good neighborhood pizza place. Used a coupon in Peoria paper and got large pizza and wings.   Pepperoni pizza was above average. Crust was great, sauce was sweet ish and pretty good though could use more flavor.   The wings were the disappointment. Soggy and low on meat. Will try here again, but without the wings."}
{"text":"I rated 1 because I couldn't rate 0. Disgusting! My sandwich was drowning in dressing. I couldn't even taste the actual sandwich. Pizza by the slice starts out with an old piece of cheese pizza, then they put cheap toppings on it and warm it up a bit. The sausage was those tiny turd looking ones you find on a cheap microwave pizza. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for 3 years.  I decided to try this place for the first time this weekend.  The pizza was great. Thin crust with a good amount of sauce and cheese.  The kids liked it and we got the boneless wings bow and mild sauce.  Everything was really good and we will be back.    Not much to see for decor but the pizza was good"}
{"text":"Very good thin crust or deep dish pizza, the veggie is awesome.  Their wings are hard to top as well.  Owned by the guy who started the Grande Pizza on Union Hills, he is now out here to make this Grande as good as his last one.  Inside seating is somewhat cozy but very doable, even with kids."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Sometimes the places you wouldn't expect are great. This is one of them. I had their pepperoni and black olive pizza and enjoyed it. Great crust, thin and crisp. The toppings tasted fresh. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time customer   Awesome pizza,  awesome sub,  awesome crust and bread..  Very friendly staff...  Decent prices...   Only complaint is the 50¢ a refill   Highy recommend this place"}
{"text":"Decided to order a pizza for dinner and ordered a large Grande Special. The website said the price was $20.95. The girl who I placed the order with on the phone was very nice, she told me the ingredients, and said it would be delivered in around 45 minutes, which was fine. Ten minutes later, the pizza was delivered and I was charged $25.95. The pizza was hot, but that was the only good thing about it. It was soggy, the vegetables were soggy, and it just tasted terrible, especially the cheese. Very dissapointing, will not call again."}
{"text":"Mom & Pop family pizza place, with Italian accents included.  Friendly service & clean atmosphere that is rather plain with hard backed booths, a few small TV's, a handful of domestic draft beers, and a few pizzas in the window for ordering by the slice.  Outside isn't as appealing in this worn strip mall on the north side of Union Hills.  Parking is abundant.  Lot of lunch specials.  Two slices & soda pop for $4.25.  There is certainly value to be found at Grande Pizza.  Pizza was just alright, and I ordered by the slice, so I knew I would be getting slices from earlier that were reheated.  Best feature was the crust (at the end) that was like a great crispy crunchy crusty white bread.  Leading up to the crust was less inspiring, with the cheese and sauce being somewhat bland, and I hate to report a somewhat bland papery cardboard component in the flavors.    I'll give them another shot soon, and I'll venture into a Calzone or perhaps order a fresh pie.  The family feel of the business and clean, non-nonsense atmosphere were very appealing.  A hot lunch for under $5 is hard to find, and they have it."}
{"text":"Decided on this establishment because of reviews via google maps. I'm not really sure how this place has such a high rating because we were highly disappointed. Ordered the Veggie pizza and it might as well be called a black olive and onion pizza. There was a minimal amount of other veggies on it and the sauce was severely lacking in taste. Should've went to Papa Murphy's and bought two pies for the price of this one crappy pizza. We just had water to drink, but noticed that soda refills are, .50! Who charges for refills these days!? So not recommended...blech."}
{"text":"Very good pizza place... Very friendly... Great environment. We got half pepperoni and half cheese pizza and wings. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Friendly people and great pizza, wings, spaghetti, everything I have tried is good.  Highly recommended."}
