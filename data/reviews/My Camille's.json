{"text":"I travel a lot and I'm always looking for new places to eat. I called in to make a to go order and the lovely lady on the line informed me that she would let me in to pickup order. I didn't understand but then realized after the conversation that the store had closed! I rushed as fast as I could to get to the location. The two friendly ladies greeted me and were really nice! (The store is closed and some lights are off!) Grateful that they feed me because this Tuscan soup is THE BEST THING EVER! I've been here for two days and I can't wait to explore more of the city and taste some great food!"}
{"text":"My Camille's on N Tryon Street is amazing! It's very close to uncc and they offer a 10% discount to uncc students. Family owned, I do have to say as my one criticism that without the discount the prices are a bit high but the food quality always makes up for it and is a nice splurge once in a while. All the smoothies and flatbread pizzas are excellent. Staff are very nice and always very friendly when you visit. They also offer food delivery through postmates, uber eats, and grub-hub so if you don't feel like going out you can always order in. Superb place!"}
{"text":"The wrap.My daughter order on meat was tasty. The smoothie was good. The service was somewhat slow seeing we were the only ones there. I would go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited today on our lunch break.  The store was empty aside from one party of 11 people, but there was still ample space and it seemed relatively empty.  We both ordered pizzas, which took almost 40 min to get to our table with a loose apology about having to serve a large party.  The pizzas themselves seemed thrown together, but, tasted good.  We had to rush to get back to our offices, so we didn't get to try dessert or smoothies.  We will think about giving it another chance, but it is clear they are not ready for any sort of \"lunch rush\"."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Ugh. Great egg and cheese with tomato spinach and Ciabatta bread.  had a genuine smoothie. No added sugar etc. Peach breeze tropical kale mix. Glad I got to try this spot! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's nice to see a place here in university that gives you freshly made food with lots of healthy well portioned options. 

I tried there strawberry banana smoothie, the Greek pizza and their Basil grilled chicken breast sandwich. The portions are not big they are just right and very tasty food.

Service was very attentive, fast and friendly\", it's easy to get too and comfortable. Prices are reasonable and it's a great option for a quick lunch or dinner. 

I believe they have breakfast but I haven't tried it. Awesome new little restaurant, it has potential."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I ordered the caesar salad, it was just ok. I could've made a better one at home. I also had a smoothie. The flavor was fine but very icey. I guess I'm used to making mine with frozen fruit to avoid having to use ice. I'd suggest they do the same...but that's just my opinion. 

I'm going to give them another shot, I'll just order something else."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. They serve breakfast all day so my husband got the \"make your own omelette\" with red/green peppers, bacon, pepper jack cheese w/ extra eggs and I had a Tropical Kale smoothie and not only was the food great but the staff is AMAZING! I had to ask for their names because they deserve the recognition. Becky made our food and Camille took our order and brought us our food.  If I lived closer I'd be a regular! Give them a try, you won't be disappointed. There's a reason why they have high ratings!"}
{"text":"I visited this location on Saturday for lunch with my daughter. The person that took our order (possibly the owner) was very patient and informative as this was our first visit. Everything on the menu sounded tasty. The prices were very reasonable. I was impressed that they serve breakfast items all day, that's always a plus. We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious chef's salad and blueberry pie smoothie today, both made with freshest ingredients.  Friendly, attentive service.  Thanks!  I like to support small, privately owned businesses such as Camille's."}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte NC and looking for a place to eat breakfast. I searched Yelp and found this jewel. I had the chipolte bbq sandwich on cibatta. It was delicious and flavorful. My sister had the omelet and said that it was best she's ever had.It's also black owned. Check it out....."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch. I try to eat healthy by consuming fresh natural products and My Camille's Wraps hit the spot. I've tried two wraps so far and the Spicy Chicken Wasabi Wrap is my favorite."}
{"text":"The sauce on pizza was fermented/spoilt causing a terrible episode of food poisoning!
The service was slow but that turned out to be least worrisome. The health score was deceptive and the server did not change gloves between taking orders on iPad, operating blender and preparing food (salads, pizzas and sandwiches). I regret not walking away at that point. You are warned!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. I just walked past and decided to check out the place. It is a cute neighborhood cafe with such good fresh food. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I visited My Camille's for lunch one day.I would like to start by saying the staff/owners are really sweet and welcoming.I ordered a chef salad with a smoothie and unfortunately neither of them were a wow factor for me.My salad consisted of a good amount of the back/light green pieces within the romain lettuce which I personally don't like because they are bitter compared to the dark green pieces.My smoothie was really icy and not tasty.I believe they used fresh fruit and one of the things with fresh fruit is that it produces a liquid and grinding it with ice creates too much liquid thus taking away from the sweetness.I've learned from my Nutribullet frozen fruit is better to use.Overall,I feel like there are not many food options like My Camille's in the University area so thanks to them for fulfilling that need."}
{"text":"I had the Thai wrap and it was delicious! I just wish they gave you the dressing on the side instead of mixing it in the wrap itself."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I ordered this on uber eats. He got the club sandwich with chips & salsa & I got a quesadilla wrap with salsa. My boyfriend definitely got the better end of the deal because his sandwich was meh. It was alright. 

But my wrap? Whole different story.
First off, the wrap was so small, & it wasn't even that tasty in all honesty. It had so much sour cream on it that I couldn't even eat it all. Oh & to top off the wrap, they even added their own personal flair by adding in a hair to my wrap!! What a nice spin on texture! (Not). 

The chips & salsa was literally Tostitos chips & Tostitos salsa. I have eaten enough of that chips & salsa to know what Tostitos are. They also give you the most minuscule amount of salsa, but I had salsa in my pantry, so I mean it was better than eating Tostitos salsa I guess. 

Will not be returning, but I hope their cooks find hair nets"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here yesterday to get some food right before heading to work and it was great. 

As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm smile from the owner herself behind the counter. The location is very spacious and has plenty of seating. It was our first time there so she helped by recommending some of the favorites off the menu. 

I ordered the Kickin' BBQ Chicken Pizza and my wife had the Vaganini sandwhich. The menu had a wide variety of selections for just about anybody. Both options we had were really good. You could tell that they made the order carefully and that it wasn't just thrown together. Service was outstanding and the food came out timely. Can't ask for much more than that.

We'll definitely come back here,
Thanks Camille!"}
{"text":"Good, but small serving for the price 

Ordered a Spicy Chicken Wasabi wrap, which was OK but not spicy at all. That, with a small bag of chips and a 7 ounce can of Coke, was $13 at the Innovation Park popup."}
{"text":"I loved the service I received here. It set the tone for what ended up being a very enjoyable meal that my girlfriend and I enjoyed. We were looking for healthy options initially. The wraps we ordered were spot on. To eat a little on the \"less healthy\" side we tried a pizza which was also very good. Healthy food. Great service."}
{"text":"They are never available ever. Mediocre food when they are. Wanted to like them but service can be a lot better. Hopefully it improves."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Super friendly and welcoming. The Zorba Greek was really good. If I find myself in this area again I will be returning. 

Missing star because I didn't know the pizza had onions and I don't like onions. Also the chips and salsa were like the mini tostitos."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is delicious and the staff is kind and generous. The salads and smoothies have me driving across the city to get lunch here a couple times per week."}
{"text":"Great new place.  Very clean.  Awesome personality at counter. Mother and daughter team. Food is fresh nothing packaged. Very refreshing in premade world.  They will need volume to survive. So try them out. Food was excellent. Not boring."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese flatbread for lunch at work and it was raw! Very disappointed!!! This is not the first event at a pop up in innovation park i ordered a chicken wrap. Might as well call it a veggie wrap, there was only 3 or 4 small chuncks of chicken..."}
{"text":"The place was very cute and loved the flower decor on the tables. Staff was very pleasant and helped me and my friend decide what to choose out of many items on the menu. There's is a variety to choose from, sandwiches, pizzas, salads, etc. I had such a hard time deciding since everything sounded so tasty and fresh. The staff brought OIT the food to us when it was ready and even brought out napkins. The smoothies sounded really refreshing. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Healthy food and need to be there before they close on weekdays for any food. Next time when I M here will definitely try their lunch box."}
{"text":"Really great place that's still relatively new and much needed in the university area. It's ran by a mother daughter duo that really care and have a great way of showing it. They are very personal and nice and take their time to ensure satisfaction. 

The food is fresh and tasty. Made to order so you can customize it as much as you want. Want a wrap as a sandwich or vice verse? Don't be afraid to ask. If it's possible they will get it done for you.

They have a good bit of room inside with at least 15 tables. Perfect if you are on your lunch break or going out for a dinner with your family. Stop in and grab a wrap and a salad and make it a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Good food! Smoothies are amazing. 
I got the Chicken California Wrap which was refreshing! My boyfriend got the Wasabi wrap and it was super good! 
Will come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, awesome clean restaurant and amazing smoothies. Vegan friendly and not super overpriced. I enjoyed the chips and salsa that came with my sandwich all for 7 bucks!!!!! Love this place definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken wrap and that was a waste of $7! It was dry. The employee who made my wrap, put her nose to my wasabi sauce and sniffed it before she gave it to me. Needless to say I didn't eat it. I wouldn't recommend going to this place. Although the service wasn't horrible, it wasn't the most professional or welcoming. Neither employee wore any form of hair covering and both were dressed inappropriately."}
