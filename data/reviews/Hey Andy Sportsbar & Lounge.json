{"text":"Horrible!!! I smoke and couldn't even stand walking through the cloud of smoke! We ended up leaving our drinks abd running out the door!"}
{"text":"Yuck yuck yuck!  This place is just wrong, from the lack of air circulation that traps you in a cigarette smoke cloud, to the general lack of interest the owner have in the business upkeep, as in no air conditioning. I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  Stay away, I'd give it negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"We used to come to Hey Andy for Super Bowl Parties back in the Early 90's. The place was a sports bar and owned by a good friend's father. The crowd was your basic steel mill crowd, think Pittsburgh Dad with more 'tude and babushka wearing women.                        The Super Bowl parties were epic, Andy's wife would spend days cooking for the closed door affair. Her menu reflected on the two teams playing in the big game. When it was Buffalo, we had wings and beef on weck sandwiches. Dallas was in one year, we had pulled brisket and ribs. It was always a good time. Never went there unless it was a Super Bowl party.       Other than the invitee Super Bowl parties , all I can say is Hey Andy is a typical shot and beer, mill hunky bar in the Mon Valley."}
