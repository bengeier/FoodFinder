{"text":"I go to this place pretty regularly - the owner is amazing - he knows his place and loves to share his knowledge about beer with you. Every visit the staff has been helpful and friendly. The food - well I cannot say enough good things about the sandwiches. I also like that they feature a lot of local breweries on draft and offer you a chance to sample something new every Wednesday - great idea. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"basic place but food and beer selection are good as is the service"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for the first time today to give Carson Street Deli a try. I had pretty high expectations coming in and thankfully I was not disappointed! I ordered the Balboa sandwich and it was pretty unreal. Being an Italian I was thrilled when I saw they had sopressata in the sandwich."}
{"text":"I love a good sandwich. I had been looking for a quick sandwich shop in Pittsburgh for awhile. My boyfriend had gone for lunch before and suggested it. He had wanted to go back for some time but kept forgetting what the name was. A Deli on Carson Street named Carson Street Deli can be a mind bender, I guess. 

Their sandwiches are good and all their stuff is really fresh. They also have a good selection of beer to have with your sammy so, that's a plus! 

The beers are in with soda and other drinks and when we brought our beers up to the counter to pay for them the cashier made sure to lean in really close to check our eye colors to make sure they matched our IDs. That was hilarious but it didn't make my Cool Breeze tuna sandwich taste any less! Definitely a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Super well curated draft list and the beer cheese & pretzels is my new favorite thing. The sandwiches are also great. The boyf dubbed the corned beef in the Reuben the best he's ever had. And great staff!"}
{"text":"Tuna sandwich was huge and delicious!  All white albacore tuna with just the right amount of mayo. The staff was friendly and although I didn't have a beer their selection is amazing.  This place is a gem in an overcrowded sea of south side dining options."}
{"text":"I feel strongly that this place is great.   I have been here a couple times to eat, most recently to have a Reuben.  The sandwich was delicious with a  lot of meat.  I was concerned that the sandwich wasn't grilled.. At first I was put of by this but really it was very good like this. 

They have a decently size list of craft beers on draft, many of which are local. I love that for 7 bucks you can pick any 4 beers to samples in a little flight, which is a good way to try different beers.  
They also do beer sampling nights on Wednesdays which is fun.  ALSO, as far as beer goes, they have a very nice selection for build your own 6 pack.

Staff is friendly with quick service!  Overall a great place to have in the neighborhood, can't wait for it to get warm so I can sit in their \"beer garden\"."}
{"text":"I wish there was a possibility to give more than 5 stars! I received a personal message from the owner apologizing for the interaction I had with one of his employees, as previously described.  His apology, along with the support of other employees on that day, as well as the many interactions I have had with many other employees in the months that I have been frequenting Carson Street Deli prove that this one person does not represent what this business is all about.  No one can control each and every action and word that an employee chooses to do or say and no matter how much you screen and train, there is always someone who slips through the cracks.  I do not fault the owner or the business for this interaction whatsoever. 

I continue to wholeheartedly support Carson Street Deli and suggest that you do too!"}
{"text":"Whether you just want a good ol' turkey sandwich or want to get crafty and try the famous \"Donnie Brasco\" this place will always satisfy your taste buds. 

From custom sandwiches (hot and cold) to freshly made sides and probably the best craft beer selection in the south side, this place is superb. 

Try these guys out for a quick lunch or a dinner with friends and family.

A+ service and quality food. Keep doin' your thing!"}
{"text":"Had the best roast beef sandwich, called the 'Roast Beast'! Great atmosphere. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu. Awesome that you can build your own 6 pack, too."}
{"text":"The pastrami sandwich was great, the gentleman with the cool mustache was great, could not partake in any of the craft beers, but the selection appeared to be great also.  The only reason I did not give the restaurant 5 stars is that the gentleman that rang me out was a Grouch!"}
{"text":"I've made a handful of visits to Pittsburgh over the last couple months and I make sure to always swing by this place at least once.  I've tried a different sandwich each time and all are superb. I really liked the Donnie Brasco.

What drew me to Carson Street deli was their beer selection, which is one of the best from the places visited on Carson street.  Make sure to check out their cooler along the side to find some goodies in there.  Mike, the owner, helped me out in a pinch regarding a limited beer and you can tell the guy loves craft brews and his customers.

The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the beer selection is awesome.  I will continue to pop into this place every chance I get. Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Okay.. I'm in love. Friendly staff & amazing sandwiches.  Their bacon is extra crispy too. If you're looking for a casual but cute place, try it!"}
{"text":"Go to subway instead. This place is overrpriced and not very good. I would say the 5 best sandwich shops in south side are

1. real mccoys
2. fatheads
3. primantis
4. south side steaks
5. subway"}
{"text":"Beer selection was fantastic! Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. It's a great place."}
{"text":"The Carson Street Deli might as well be my kitchen. I've eaten almost one meal a day here since I moved to south side in August.  The ingredients are fresh and everything on the menu tastes phenomenal and consistent. I usually rotate between the Reuben, Cuban, Donnie Brasco (buffalo chicken with egg salad - don't make assumptions before you've tried it), and their chicken salad. The portions are very healthy, and yes, every sandwich comes with a pickle. 

They have really good beer too. Plus, you can build your own 6-pack to try some of those interesting looking bottles without having to buy a whole 6 pack of it. If you have any beer-related questions, ask the older guy walking around stocking the shelves."}
{"text":"Four emphatic stars for the delicious-ness of the food we had here for lunch, and the fun, hip atmosphere!  The balboa...amazing.  Added the fire roasted veggie soup which was pretty good as well!  Loved the atmosphere and overall feel of the place.  I took away a star because the lunch special ended up not being much of a special (half of a sandwich and a cup of soup for the full price of the sandwich).  While I would have preferred to not spend $9 for half of a sandwich and a small cup of soup, it was definitely a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I went on my lunch break Tuesday.
Awesome lunch special! 1/2 sandwich (portions are ) and the linguini salad w/ a Budweiser! Beer selection is awesome. And they have an outside seating area with flowers! Going back soon. Try the Jay!"}
{"text":"They have a new owner who has alot of knowledge about craft beers they now carry. Great envirorment and some of the best sandwiches in all PA. You can't beat the price with the quality."}
{"text":"I really loved my Veggie deluxe. I've only been here once and I have dreams about it. I really wanna try the black bean burger. While visiting Pitt, it was very hard to come by veggie meals. I was so happy when my friend took me here. Great food! And next time I come to visit her I'll be eating here."}
{"text":"My fiancee came home one day and announced he had the best reuben of his life at the Carson St. Deli. He told me it had coleslaw instead of sourkraut. I refused to believe it, but when the day came that I was able to try it for myself, I finally understood! It may not be traditional but it is completely delicious. I tried the macaroni salad and thought it was bland.

They have an awesome selection of microbrews and apparently you can bring growlers in to be filled. The owner, Mike, is so friendly. His love for his business and appreciation for his customers is obvious. He stopped by our table to make sure we were enjoying our meal. We got to talking and he told us that the type of corned beef they use was painstakingly chosen via blind tastings with customers. The source is secret but you can always visit Carson Street Deli if you have a craving!"}
{"text":"Great and fairly new spot on the Southside is the Carson Street Deli! Great beer selection with something for everyone! It seems now, all beers on tap have to be hoppy or sour! Sorry, but sours aren't really beer! This place actually has something for everyone, not just the too cool for school kids! They have a cask system that regularly pours out some great beer. My fave is the Lavery Imperial Red. Try the food too. They switched up the bacon on their BLT and its amazing!"}
{"text":"The Donny Brasco is a winning combination of a sandwich, and the taps hold a decent selection of local brews."}
{"text":"Sandwiches made with delicious fresh bread and loaded with lean meat keep me going back. However, at more than $10 for a sandwhich and side, I limit my visits. Also, considering you get your own drink and order/pick up food at the counter, the the big ol' tip jar in front of the cash register seems unwarranted?"}
{"text":"This is my go to south side venue to try quality, frequently rotating craft beer drafts. They devote seemingly half their selection to locally operated breweries while sill pouring occasional rare stout releases. Their 4 pour flight for 7 dollars is great value and serves as a way to experience what they have to offer while still being able to drive home safely. The staff is knowledgeable of their to go can/bottle selections (wish they had prices on them though so I didn't have to always ask as I peruse).  The bartenders have always been polite, attentive, and seemingly passionate about their offerings. Their sandwiches are quality, but my only personal gripe as a big eater is that portion sizes leave me a little to be desired. I often finding myself getting a large slice at Benny's or a 10-12 dollar headwich at fat heads. That's not a knock on them though hence the 5 stars still...I just eat abnormally large portions lol. I absolutely love coming here for their laid back vibe and awesome rotating crafts"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are so good that when you find one you love you don't want to order anything else.  But that would be a mistake because you would be missing out on so many other delicious sandwiches.  

To start off with check out the Godfather - Sopressata imported Genoa Salami on a baguette w/provolone, oil, oregano, red roasted peppers.

Or how about their Po-Boy which has two of the biggest and most tasty Crab Cakes I've ever had on a fresh french baguette.  Add a little Frank's hot sauce and you've got yourself a meal."}
{"text":"It's been too long since I've been here and it's still fantastic. Not a beer snob but beer snobs would love this place. But even more impressive is the hoagies, definitely the best in the city. 

In the old days the GODFATHER was my go to. Today the BALBOA with a KO. Sopressata, salami, prosciutto, spicy capicola, hard salami, provolone and on and on and on."}
{"text":"I got the Sicilian sandwich, it tasted alright. I wasn't jumping up and down at the cost, subway is still cheaper. Food was made fast, the outside seating was cute."}
{"text":"The beer selection is great, bottle selection also great. Not as big as Atlas in Lawrenceville but still vast and unique, their 6 pack deals can't be beat as far as price goes. $2 off per bottle. Sandwiches are affordable and good of course and the draft selection is as well. Cool atmosphere and great aesthetic. Not really sure about hours though, door says they close at 11 but they started closing up at 10 and it got a little weird."}
{"text":"This is our second time back here in 4 years. It's been a long time but the sandwiches are still so delicious! We both got the balboa. Fun little place and nice staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite deli in Pittsburgh! When I first started coming here, it was a simple deli with some 6-pack options. Now, they've made some additions to the menu and have drinks on tap. My favorite sandwich here is the reuben and it is actually my favorite reuben of all time. I've tried a couple other sandwiches on the menu but the reuben still holds the spot for favorite. However, you really can't go wrong with anything you get. It's also nice they give you the option to create your own sandwich in case you're in the mood for something simple. Every time my husband and I come here, we also always get the rice pudding. It's not made there, but it's from another local business. So good! I really love this place and wish I worked closer so I could stop here for lunch more often."}
{"text":"My whole Carson St experience started with a very grouchy and seemingly put-out woman on the other end of the phone. I placed a large carry out order and didn't expect to pick it up for another hour, giving them plenty of time to work their sandwich magic. She warned me of this in between sighs and I almost canceled my order because she was so rude.

So glad I didn't. I came in an hour later to get my order and the same lady apologized for taking so long. I told her I didn't mind the wait but did mind her phone manner. She was immediately, genuinely apologetic and was frantic with orders.  She didn't get an attitude but had real class in dealing with my frustration. 

Everyone in my group really enjoyed the grub (despite the expected gooey-ness that comes with carry out). I had the Carson St Reuben with turkey. It was divine... and huge! They don't toast the bread which I actually appreciated. The turkey, cheese and cole slaw were in perfect proportions against the thick slices of marble bread. Mmm, my belly is growling just thinking about it. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Everything tastes very old. My roast beef is the cheap yucky manufactured stuff. Took a couple bites and really could not bring myself to finish it. This place is a bummer."}
{"text":"Went in with a large party for lunch (9 people) during the week since we all synchronized our lunch hours so that we could catch up and enjoy a meal together.  I was very happy to see that we got put up in the loft overhang area so we could be loud (talking not being obnoxious of course) without disturbing the rest of the patrons.

I usually take my time looking at the menu in an effort to (1) pick a dish worthy of a Yelp review but also (2) challenge my palate and brain to keep it fresh.  Unfortunately taking my time was not going to work so I went with my olde standby--the closest thing I could get to a Turkey BLT type sandwich.  ...because bacon makes EVERYTHING better.

All in all we had a chicken strips meal, a couple steak hoagies, my turkey blt, a fish sandwich, and a couple salads.  All of the food came in about 20 minutes, which considering we probably overwhelmed the kitchen, that was pretty awesome timing.

All of the food tasted excellently, and it was warm or still piping hot when it got to us.  Aside from a bit of a delay in keeping out glasses full of water/pop, service was on-point and efficient.  But that's to be expected since we were a larger group and we were up by ourselves upstairs and our waitress had tables downstairs as well.

I can't wait to go back with a little more time to give their beer selection a shot and maybe order something different. :-)"}
{"text":"Came here to enjoy their wonderful selection of local craft beers on draft. My review is just based on the beer alone as we had eaten lunch somewhere else but I wish I hadn't I would have loved to try this place out. For it being a Monday afternoon it was very busy. Had a couple flights of beer which were all wonderful. Service was great! They also have a great beer selection to purchase. Great place!"}
{"text":"we've eaten here a couple times while in the pburgh area.  never disappointed.  great craft beer selection, almost overwhelming!  and the sandwiches are large and yummy!! as 1st/2nd timers, id wished the staff was a lil more welcoming in regards to guiding us through the motions, but nothing that would stray us away from returning!"}
{"text":"Great beer and food. Small bar and no tvs above it but it's worth looking for a spot. Tables good for groups, Wednesdays are crazy packed for beer tastings."}
{"text":"I love trying new places on Carson since I recently moved down there, and this spot did not let me down. I am sad that I didn't discover this gem sooner. I ordered their Italian sandwich with a side of cucumber tomato salad. The sandwich was absolutely delicious and packed with yummy meats. The salad also yummy and I ate every bit. I will for sure be back here and try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am not a huge craft beer person, I prefer wine and cider. However, I broke with tradition when I came here and ordered a beer and tried a few others. They have an incredible selection, and the bartender (a.k.a. \"the mustache guy\") is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I started with a french farmhouse style beer from Lavery Brewing Company in Erie, and it was delicious. I then of course reverted to my usual cider and had the bone dry from Arsenal, which is my absolute favorite cider. Ever. 

It's quaint inside, and when you walk in, the bar is the first thing you see on your left. As you keep walking, the place to order sandwiches is on the left, and then there is a large selection of bottled beers to take home on the right. You can make your own six pack, and there is a really good selection (this coming from the not a huge beer person-but don't worry, others have confirmed this).

I sat at the bar with friends and we ended up ordering sandwiches as well. I had the cheesy beefy, and I would certainly go back just for the sandwich! Perfectly beefy. Perfectly cheesy. Enough veggies on the sandwich to keep me from feeling too guilty.

My friends and I met the owner, who was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about craft beers. I look forward to coming back with friends, especially because it didn't have any of the \"seedy South-side feel\" that I desperately try to avoid.

Try this place for delicious beer and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Carson Street Deli!!!! I convinced my coworkers to order delivery from them a few months ago and, despite it being a huge order and across the river in Oakland, everything arrived fresh and still hot! I've eaten in several times since then as well as gotten take out and delivery. I have to admit that I've only eaten the Veggie Roma, but that's because it is SO DELICIOUS that I can't bring myself to try anything else! However, between friends and coworkers, I've never gotten a complaint -- only rave reviews on the bread, fresh ingredients, and pickles!"}
{"text":"Nice, casual atmosphere, 3 little pigs sandwich is awesome. They have plenty of beer options on tap and many craft brews served."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the broad selection of inventive sandwiches here. The Dizzy Lizzy, with its curried chicken, dried cranberries, and amazing slaw is my solid go-to, but everything I've tried is fantastic.
Also, let me sing the praises of their extensive beer selection. A wide variety of well chosen craft beers awaits, and the seasonal offering is simply spot-on.
For the purveyor of perfectly crafted sandwiches, this stop is a must-try."}
{"text":"After trekking through the Carnegie for a couple of hours, we were starved! Sandwiches were huge and cheap and made quickly. We picked this place specifically for the beer selection. The boys loved the options and were so happy we picked this place. 

Parking is either on street (good luck with that) or just a few blocks down there is a pay lot. Not super expensive either."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place! I love the make your own deli sandwiches and the buffalo chicken sub! They also have a fun bar area with samplers! During the warm weather the patio is a perfect location - it sits off of Carson so even during the crazy nights you are away from the drunks and can enjoy your dinner and a beer."}
{"text":"Awesome! Fantastic fresh food with great taste, cool craft beer selection and a very upbeat and dedicated staff that loves their jobs. I gave 4 stars instead if 5 only because I thought the food could be made a tad bit quicker. Still a great spot though!!"}
{"text":"I dropped in unexpectedly with CM for a snack around 7:30 last night.  CM was hungry because he hadn't eaten dinner, and we were expecting to try one of the breakfast sandwiches at Delanie's Coffee, where we were originally planning to head.  However, the barista there apologetically informed us that he turned off the oven at 7, since it takes a long time to cool down.  He recommended Carson St. Deli as an alternative place to get a sandwich, which I recognized as a place that I'd bookmarked on Yelp, so we headed on over.

CM ordered the Mark Cuban ($8.25), a variant on the classic cuban sandwich.  This version substituted chicken for the pulled pork, a roll for the bread, and was toasted rather than being pressed like a panini, judging by the meltiness of the Swiss cheese.  Although I didn't try it, CM was very pleased with this sandwich, which satiated his hunger well.  As for me, I had to order the Donnie Brasco ($8.25), a layered egg salad and buffalo chicken sandwich, based on other reviewers' comments.  This was one of the more unique sandwiches I've eaten.  It was quite flavorful and substantial, and was bookended by good quality Italian bread.  However, it was one of the messiest sandwiches I've ever eaten, due to the mayonnaise and buffalo sauce and the small pieces of hard boiled egg and chicken.  Fortunately, CM and I have reached the point where we're comfortable eating messy foods in front of one another, so it wasn't an issue.  ;-)

The ambiance was surprisingly quiet for a bar, due to the fact that there was only a couple of other customers when we were there, and that the TVs were muted.  We enjoyed the oldies music that was playing, which somehow seemed appropriate for a sandwich shop such as this.  Service from an older gentleman I'm guessing may be the owner was friendly and pretty efficient.  One quirky thing that caught us off guard is that if you eat in, you pay after you finish eating, rather than when you order. In retrospect, however, this makes sense in light of this place being a bar, given that many people probably want to run a tab.  (I didn't think of this since we didn't have anything to drink.)  Although the prices have gone up a bit, we felt that they were still pretty reasonable (total check: $16.50).  Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience here, and would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Maybe it's a slow day...but we are here plus one other person. The guy sitting next to us had to ask for his sandwich to be microwaved...then when she brought it back he had no napkins and everyone was too busy on their cell phones in the kitchen for him to ask for a napkin. He literally had to reach in his pocket for a napkin. The cook did finally get us a beer...but waited on us with kitchen gloves on and handled our money. Not the amazingly friendly service the sign describes."}
{"text":"Very rude staff and warm kegs producing a lot of foam. Had a lot of hope... Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH. It is seriously like a dream come true. The sandwiches are very creative and use ingredients that I wouldn't have thought to combine but I'm so very glad I ate. Some favorites are the Donnie Brasco (buffalo chicken and egg salad with pepper jack and banana peppers), the Bourne Farm (ham, cheese and apple on a croissant), the Dizzy Lizzy (curry chicken salad wrap), Chicken Pitaza (chicken parm + pepperoni on a pita)... I could go on and on. Ingredients are fresh and the beer selection is amazing, each time I go I discover a new local brewery that has beer on tap. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Really good sandwich shop. Tried their cheesy beefy for a quick lunch and it was delicious. I would reccomend it to anyone walking in the door.  If youre a beer drinker they have good drafts on tap with a decent selection of 6 packs to go. No liquor though."}
{"text":"I have had a few of their sammys, but the reuben is something else.  The marbled rye is fresh and soft, the slaw is unlike any I have had before, and the corned beef is ample and delicious.  

The beer selections is also legit (shoot I think I am missing one of their beer tastings as I write this) and worth popping in for a carryout or a drink in.  

The staff is cool and the sandwhiches come out fast. 

Just go."}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews, my colleague and I came in here for a drink, with the possibility of dinner.  The entire establishment had about 3 other people in here at 8pm on a Thursday.  Where was everyone?  

Seeing that they had a great variety of beers on tap (the main reason why we came), we decided to order 2 separate flights of 4 beers.  I gotta say, I'm a big fan of Levante Brewing Company.  Their maltier beers dominated my flight, and I really enjoyed the experience.  As with any flight, a few of the beers for both my colleague and I were hit or miss, but the 4 beer samples for $7 made it a worthwhile experience.  

We actually left without food because we wanted to seek out a place with a bit more atmosphere for dinner.  I would definitely come here for a quiet place to sample beers!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the food which is primarily deli sandwiches, is really good too! The staff is enthusiastic about the establishment and very well educated about their beers. I had the three pigs sandwich and it was delicious, and a great value for the money. It is not your typical Southside crowd of beer drinking kids. It is a bit laid back. The music is more likely to be Ella than Rihanna and you can talk and listen and enjoy good people and beer and food. What a concept!"}
{"text":"Ahh, Carson Street Deli, the crown jewel of Pittsburgh's Southside.

I work about two blocks away from The Deli (yes, it needs to be \"The Deli\") and rest assured, I order from here for lunch about once a week. That being said, it's the ONLY place I consistently order from. Their sandwiches are amazing, the beer selection even better. Mike, the owner, is knowledgeable and passionate about his brews as well as extremely personable and friendly. They have routine beer tastings on top of all that, though I've never had the pleasure of partaking in them. Sandwiches typically run about $7-10 and I've always been able to make them last for 2 meals (so really, I'm only spending $3.50 for lunch, right?!?!)

Pleasant and secluded patio out back - definitely worth checking out on a nice day.

Only downside is that I can't get one of their great craft brews on my lunch break. Darn!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years..... I pretty much always get the Classic Italian. It is my favorite cold cut hoagie in Pittsburgh. The bread is always fresh, and you can tell that the meat is of very high quality. I recently tried the buffalo chicken hoagie, and that was also good, but I will continue to go back to the classic Italian. They have some sides in coolers to go along with your sandwich and a few soups. They have many different craft beers if that is what you're in to. It is never to busy. You can eat in, or get it to go. It is a very relaxing environment. If you're in the Southside and you want a notch above jimmy johns and some craft beers, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I knew I'd love the beer here. And I did!! We attended a Yelp event here last night and it was my first time to check this place out! I was really impressed with Mike and his wife who were extremely gracious hosts! Mike really knows his beer and provided a terrific introduction and tons of samples of some extraordinary beer! He prides himself on having beers on his 12 taps that you likely haven't seen or tried before. In fact, he said he bet that no one had heard of these beers. Well, he was close. I had a few of them before but the rest? He was right! And I headed right for the samples of those!! The local Lavery brew that had just won GOLD at the Great American Beer Festival was AMAZING!! So good!! What a great place to come sample some delightful craft brews in a welcoming environment!!

We ordered some food too - the Pastrami Mama was a delight and I would order that again!! Can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches (and get more of those pretzels and amazing beer cheese!) and to see what else he has in store on tap!! Mike is so knowledgable and eager to share his enthusiasm with other beer aficionados! Love it!!  A great place and worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Always new draft beers to try, so I usually get a flight so I can have a variety. Good bottle selection to take out a 6-pack, and their sandwiches are all great. They have slider options too that aren't on their main menu so if you want to try a few of their sandwiches, that's a good option too. I'm not a vegetarian, but enjoy their Veggie Roma often. If you want something real delicious and don't care about calories, get a Cheesy Beefy."}
{"text":"So glad I was finally able to try this place! It's been on my list for a long time, and I finally went with my husband and some friends last Friday.

The staff was extremely nice and helpful in terms of understanding the menu and the ordering process. They have a great beer list and a ton of options to choose from on the menu.

I'm a vegetarian, so I ordered the veggie roma sandwich and a cup of black bean soup. The soup was DELICIOUS. I love black bean soup, and this was some of the best I've had. The sandwich was also good - I liked how they substituted red peppers for tomatoes to make it a bit different. I did think the sandwich was going to be warm, and I think I would have preferred it that way. But regardless, still good. And I liked that they had a few veggie options to choose from.

My only complaint here is the price. It seemed a bit pricey for sandwiches, and they don't come with any sides either.

Regardless, I'll come back - maybe for lunch. They had some good half sandwich deals for lunch. I also would like to come back when it's warmer outside to try out their courtyard area."}
{"text":"I've been living in southside for a few years and as a moderate food junkie, I stumbled into this place over the summer. I was craving buffalo chicken and decided to order the Montezuma's Revenge which was life changing. To this day I visit CSD every single Wednesday for their excellent craft beer tasting that feature some of the best breweries from around the country! My girlfriend loves this place as well and is determined to order every type of sandwich in slider form. Not too mention the extremely friendly and knowledgeable service provided by the staff and owner (Mike). After you're done enjoying a 5 star dinner and craft beer lecture and tasting, you can't leave without indulging in the vanilla bourbon cheesecake. This restaurant is not only a gem for southside but a gem for all of Pittsburgh. Already looking forward to next Wednesday! -J"}
{"text":"I love beer!  Just got back from GABF and this was a great place to relive the fun and tastes of GABF!  I was very impressed with the selection and the recommendations that the owner made!  WOW!  Lots of small local brews but also lots of delicious favs in bottle ready to take!
Decided to stay for a sandwich for dinner.  Wasn't impressed with the menu for vegetarian sandwiches, but ordered a veggie sandwich anyway.  Had it toasted, which made all the difference!  Pita with hummus and veggies.....it was good.  I will be coming back for lunch and beer!"}
{"text":"Super helpful staff. Great beer! Even better sandwich!  We shared the Balboa, just a mound of amazing Italian meats, a slice of provolone on some amazing bread!... Topped off with roasted red peppers (as if the sandwich had to be made any better).... Along with some really solid potato salad!  
Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place in Pittsburgh for a sandwich and a beer. I moved out of town a few years ago and make it a point to visit every time I'm back in Pittsburgh because it's just that good. Amazing food, fantastic selection of local craft beer, friendly staff, and great atmosphere! If you haven't been yet, make it a point to check it out- and make sure to get a 6 pack to go!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff. We walked in at 11, when they open and the woman workings response was incredibly rude since we were there so early. She huffed and puffed as she turned on the lights, music, etc. Perhaps just a miserable person. Learn customer service."}
{"text":"Crab Po' Boy is fantastic.  Lots of other good things on the menu!  Check it out."}
{"text":"How have I not tried this place before? Maybe because it looks like just another bar.  But what's through the doors is a whole lotta yumminess. For real! My partner for the Donnie Borasco. Holy SH#T it was ahmahzing.  Buffalo chicken with egg salad and other perfectly delicious thing on the perfectly soft, fresh white bread.  I got the croissant with apple, cheddar, ham and mustard.  Absolutely yum!  Then we shared some macaroni salad. It was like the kind your grandma's makes. The cool grandma that doesn't half ass stuff. It was excellent! 
They menu had alot of great choices. It was very difficult to choose. You could even make your own.... Although, no offense but it would be hard to beat the great concoctions on the menu. 
As you would expect from the name, it's a deli type atmostphere. Really basic but comfortable. I will say that if you are looking for mamouth sized sandwiches this isn't the place to go.  I'm not saying they are small by any stretch just not huge hunger busters."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend. He got the Po Boy sandwich and I got the grilled salmon salad. The sandwich was decent but also were comparing it to po boys in New Orleans so that's always hard to compete with. The salmon was wonderful- perfectly seasoned and cooked. The salad was a salad - typical stuff. What we really enjoyed was the service from our server James and we will definitely be back. The menu looks amazing and there's a lot more sandwiches and food we want to try! Not to mention beer selection. Good thing we're within walking distance. :)"}
{"text":"I have only been here a handful of times, but it never disappoints. Today my boyfriend and I went and I got the chicken pitaza. Grilled chicken, mozzarella, pepperoni, marinara sauce in a pita. Phenomenal. I had one of the craft beers they had on draft too, one I had never heard of before, ephemere, a Belgian blonde with an apple flavor. Delicious. My bf got the three little pig sandwich. Pulled pork, ham and bacon on a baguette. I obviously had to try a bite and it was also amazing. Sandwiches so big, neither of is could finish! He had an IPA, good vibes by Voodoo Brewing. He enjoyed that. They have a decent size menu, mainly sandwiches (even stuff for the kids), some sides, soup & even salads. They had about 10 beers, maybe a few more, on tap. All of them awesome craft beers, including some great local ones for pittsburgh. They have a bottle craft beer selection too, you can do mix and match six packs to go. Not sure on the price, however. I have yet to have a bad experience here & now that I've got my boyfriend hooked, I know we will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome selection of delicious sandwiches and a great selection of local craft beer on tap. Plus, an excellent selection of bottled beers for there or to go.  Favorite sandwiches are #1the Dizzy Lizzy, a curried chicken with slaw, almonds, dried cranberries all on a pita, and #2 the Donnie brasco, I honestly don't remember all that is on this sandwich, but it's delicious.  I go to Carson Street Deli at least once a week."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in California and we were visiting friends who took us here. Great call, guys! This is the kind of place that I wish I could drive to, let alone walk to.

We decided to dine in the outdoor beer garden. We shared the Veggie Burger and the Veggie Deluxe. The Burger was hearty and one of the best black bean burgers I've ever had. I was skeptical of the Deluxe seeing that it contained both hummus and baba ghanouj, but it turned out to be a perfect combination. The draft beer selection kicked ass. There were even a couple of cask-conditioned beers. Welcome to the 'burgh!

We returned a few days later because of the bottled beer selection. We grabbed a few to take home that are unavailable where we live. Fortunately, the cashier suggested that we get six so that we would be eligible for the discount. We even got a loaf of free bread that turned out to be really good. I could get used to this!

How did I get to be the Duke? I am a benevolent leader, but I believe the title belongs with a local. Come to Carson Street Deli, Pittsburghers! Craft beer and delicious sandwiches. What more do you need? I shall definitely return the next time I'm in your fair city."}
{"text":"The bread is super fresh and delicious. My husband had the Ruben and I can't tell you how delicious the bread was! I had my first taste of a Ruben, and must say, their twist on it with cole slaw is fantastic. Also, great selection of beer."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star spot. Very good sandwiches and fantastic brews. My delicate palette was satisfied. 

I'm from out of town and needed to find a place to bring my family of 10 people (nobody planned ahead). Found this place on yelp and everybody had a great time ! To boot we called 5 min in advance and it was fine."}
{"text":"4.5-  very good deli sandwiches, but nothing I would more than 10-15 minutes out of the way for, so short of a 5 for me.

I had the Jay sans dressing, very tasty, well executed. BF had the tuna and was quite happy. 

Yay! I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite deli in Pittsburgh.  I swear by it-- fresh bread, good service, and a nice size pickle which is VERY important for a deli.  I like the veggie black bean burger.  I usually get two meals out of an order here."}
{"text":"What can I say.... Fresh food, good selection of local Beer and great service. On Wednesday they have beer sampling night that's always a good time! If ya check this place out try the Chicken Pitaza it's one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Carson Street Deli (CSD) is an outstanding low-key sandwich shop that sells delicious sandwiches and great beer, bottled and draft. It is a gem in Pittsburgh's Southside, tucked in-between many bars with likely much less healthy bar food. You can get the \"great beer\" experience at Carson Street Deli while having tasty healthy food, although less healthy sandwich and burger options also seem to exist at CSD.  

CSD has excellent sandwiches. I tried the unique \"veggie deluxe,\" which had hummus, baba ghanooj, roasted peppers, vegetables. It was very tasty and fresh. I also took to go the \"cool breeze\" albacore tuna sandwich, which was unique with orange pieces in it, yet almost equally tasty. I will definitely go back for the veggie deluxe, though, as it was one of the tastiest veggie sandwiches I have had in a long while (Side note: Subway definitely lowered the bar for comparison in vegetarian items).

CSD has an excellent selection of beers, much of it gathered from local breweries and Belgium.  The draft beer selection is small: there were four beers on draft while I was there, three from Pittsburgh's own East End Brewing Company, one from Belgium. I got East End's \"Monkey Boy\" hefeweizen, a must try if you like wheat beer. Many bottled beers rest in the fridges and are sprinkled around the deli, awaiting curious customers to try them and take them home. Even not-so-frequent beer drinkers like myself might feel compelled to try varieties of beer served in colorful bottles and arranged skillfully all over the deli. 

CSD holds free beer tastings every Wednesday evening. They also bring in unique varieties once in a while. When I went, quite a few festive holiday beers were on display. I did end up buying some unique Japanese rice beer, which looked quite delicious. They also have desserts and freshly baked cookies, which I unfortunately missed the day I went there as they were already sold out. Next time, I hope to try the rice pudding, though.

The deli is very clean. In fact, the cleanliness may make you forget that you are on East Carson street, having beer. They also have free wifi which let me set up my laptop and get some work done while enjoying my sandwich and beer.

The staff are very helpful, polite, and friendly. They will let you sample drafts and choose among the reasonably large selection of sandwiches they sell. It was very clear from the attitude of the sandwich masters working there that they care about what they do and serve. And, they do know and very much care about their beer.

Carson Street Deli can be summarized in four words: \"outstanding sandwiches, beer, staff.\" No wonder it has been around and doing well since 1992. Go there if you are looking for an easy, casual place to enjoy reasonably healthy food along with some excellent beer. Go there even if you are not looking for that - you might be surprised."}
{"text":"Awesome place with a laid back feel. Great craft beer selection, great food, and friendly staff. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I tried Carson Street Deli years ago, before they moved, but I can't remember how I felt about it -- so let's treat today's lunch like it was my first visit, eh?

I was greeted by extremely friendly employees when I walked in the door, though I was slightly confused about where to actually order; I'd expected a menu board, but they found a carryout menu for me to peruse. I'd pretty well decided I wanted corned beef, and somehow missed ordering a reuben because it's listed as a \"Carson Street Deli Reuben\" -- not where I expected it, alphabetically speaking. Just so you don't make my mistake.

I ended up with corned beef, cheddar, tomato, and brown mustard on Italian (look, I don't like rye, OK?), as well as potato salad and tomato and cucumber salad. With a bottled drink, my meal came to something like $14.

The bread is, I'm pretty sure, Breadworks; not too crusty but not too soft to stand up to a big sammich. The corned beef itself is sliced super thin and tastes good, though I think I prefer Smallman Street Deli's. The cheddar slice was decently thick, and the tomato was, you know, a tomato on a sandwich, slightly out of season. Overall I'd give the sandwich 3 stars, partly because I should've asked for less mustard and partly because I wish they had challah and finally because I ordered the wrong thing. All of this is really my fault, so take it with a grain of salt.

The potato salad: Not my favorite. The chunks of potato are just huge, and there were green and red peppers involved.  Nothing to write home about, but not bad, either.

Tomato and cucumber salad? Not bad. Quite vinegary, so know that going in.

My pickle, sadly, was sort of small (just a spear for a whole big sammich) and unremarkable. 

I understand the beer is one of the big draws here; unfortunately, in my present delicate condition, I am unable to partake. And that makes me truly sad.

So why four stars overall? Well, I'm 99% sure that if I order what I actually want next time, I'll fare better. I'll be sure to let Yelp know!"}
{"text":"This is a follow up review to my initial 5 star rating for Carson Street Deli.

I have been absolutely LOVING the beer tastings, the atmosphere, and the great (not to mention local) beer selection that Mike and the Carson Street Deli have been offering. Unfortunately one night about 2 months ago I was outrageously hungry when we showed up for that week's beer tasting and decided to go with a meal there. (I normally would just wait until I get home to eat to save some money.) I say unfortunately because the meal was sadly lack luster. 

I was really honestly surprised. I hadn't even eaten anything from there prior to this and I was admittedly holding some rather high expectations. I had the grilled chicken sandwich. The bread was ok, tasted about as fresh and homemade as I had expected, but I feel like the quality ended there.

I want to just put this out there, I've worked in food service with... low to mid-grade ingredients, I know the texture and the taste. The chicken tasted, looked, and felt just like frozen pre-packaged chicken slices. The condiments/marinade/vegetables were ok though. I also had a side of the mac salad and it had absolutely no taste. None at all. Not even bland.

I haven't been back to eat since then. I will give it another try since they keep getting such great reviews from other Yelpers, I just hope this time I don't get that frozen fast food feeling."}
{"text":"This is a sandwich lover's dream! All the sandwiches are made with beautiful artisan bread and piled high with locally sourced ingredients. We came in at lunch and saw they definitely had a loyal following. The sides are glorious too. I had the cheese tortellini salad. Awesome. They have a great selection of craft beers on tap to pair with your great lunch or dinner. Did I mention the service was super fast and friendly? Of the one billion places on Carson Street, this place is a total stand out."}
{"text":"Sandwiches, beer, staff, courtyard.  That more or less sums it up but just put the adjective great in front of all that.  Ok, first their sandwiches are packed with flavor, made to order and well priced.  The beer selection was mind blowing and for single bottles in PA not overpriced.  They even have happy hour specials and apparently do free tastings once a week.  The staff is super friendly and I really wish I got to meet the owner because I heard he will talk your face off about beer.  They have a nice little courtyard out back where you can enjoy all these things with some friends!  Go now!!!"}
{"text":"I attended the Yelp Event here last week and had a great time! The owner and his primary bartender (\"the mustache\" guy) both had great personalities and kept the beer and cider samples flowing! They were also very knowledgeable about the beverages and displayed their expertise without sounding obnoxious.

I sampled five different beers and ciders but loved the Arsenal Cider Fighting Elleck the best. It really tastes more like champagne than cider which was delightful! I also tried a grilled cheese sandwich with a pumpkin cupcake made from a local bakery. The grilled cheese was perfectly melty and soft without being overly greasy. The pumpkin cupcake was moist and covered with a delicious buttercream.

The interior of the restaurant was much nicer than I had anticipated and elevates an establishment that sells beer, cider, and sandwiches. Even though this deli and bar is a bit out of the way for my husband and me, I hope we can come back again in the future!"}
{"text":"I love the new setup of Carson Street Deli.  New bar seating.  More table seating.  Excellent selection of craft beers.   Excellent menu and sandwiches.  The Reuben that I had today was very good but Szmidt's Old World Deli in Greenfield is better if you are judging on the sandwich alone."}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times and have always enjoyed myself. They do a lot of beer tastings on Wednesday nights, which is great! The drafts are also rotated frequently and there is always a sour beer on tap, which makes me a very happy lady! 

The food is excellent!!! I have had a few. The crab cake sandwich is good, but the special I had the other day was outstanding! It was roasted turkey with smoked Gouda, banana peppers and avocado on sourdough. There was supposed to be bacon. It may have been forgotten but I couldn't care less. Why? Because the garlic mayo they put on this thing was drinkable! I could and would have done shots of the stuff! I know, I'm gross, but this sandwich was not! I'm half glad that it was just the daily special because I would be corpulent in a week's time if it was on the menu regularly."}
{"text":"Carson Street Deli is a great South Side business. 

For over a year now, the owner has been running a Wednesday night beer tasting. This is the place to be to learn about every new brewery that gets distributed in Pittsburgh and learn to like a few new types of beer. Don't miss the annual stout float tasting! They also have a constantly rotating tap selection. At least one tap is always devoted to East End, and this is the place on the South Side to get East End growlers filled. If you don't have a growler, they have good prices on a great variety of choose-your-own six-packs. 

Aside from beer and Wednesday nights, Carson Street Deli has always-dependable sandwiches. Large but no grease, so it's one of the healthiest lunch options if you're on the South Side. If you get a sandwich with deli meats on Breadworks bread (i.e. the Godfather), you won't be disappointed.  

As an added bonus, this is one of the cleanest and well-lit \"bars\" on the South Side - a place you can go with your Mom or new significant other."}
{"text":"I MUSTACHE you a question - Do you crave a tasty, fresh deli sandwiches?  Are you a craft beer connoisseur?  Well my friend, look no further than the Carson Street Deli & Craft Beer Bar.

Walk in to an excellent craft draft selection, including 2 Arsenal Ciders, along with a smiling mustachioed man who would be delighted to recommend a brew, pour you a pint, and get your grub grindin' ... Oh yeah - we didn't even get to that part yet!  

Right past the bar is an amazing deli counter where they make the tastiest of tasty sandwiches.  Everything is made fresh.  I want to try EVERYTHING on their menu!  This trip I selected the Donnie Brasco - A combination of Buffalo Chicken and Egg Salad on fresh Italian bread with your choice of Ranch or Bleu Cheese.  Yeahhhhhhhh I couldn't eat it all... I tried!  Did I mention every sandwich is served with a tasty dill pickle?  YUM!  

Oh and I had a Victory's DIPA to wash things down.  Mmm craft beer :)  Once we filled up with sammies and suds, we grabbed a 6pack to go and parted ways.  Yes, parting IS such sweet sorrow!!  If I can, though, I'll return tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"As Deli's go this one is simple but limited compared to a big Deli. But don't let that throw you off. Our meal here was very good. My co-worker and I both had salads. Mine was actually better since it was a Greek Salad and I had Chicken Breast on mine and he had Chicken Salad. He liked the flavor but thought there was more mayo in it than needed.
We had beer and I was pleased with the import selection. I'm not a fan of the light unmanly brews. And they have many a good beers here.
They have a good selection of sweets also, so make it a nice simple night for a meal with out the fuss."}
{"text":"Some excellent sandwiches. The hot pastrami was sliced so thin that it was like butter. Not the biggest serving size, but one of the tastiest hot pastramis I ever had.

I also had the classic Italian. Very nice!

Only downside is their chili is kind of like Wendy's. Before purchasing, I asked the order taker how it was and he said that it is real chili with beans and not hot dog chili. That should have sounded the alarm, everyone knows real chili has no beans!"}
{"text":"One of if not my favorite spot to eat on east Carson street in Southside. Amazing food, great people, and they have selection of craft beers! A mom and pop shop that is continuously growing! Oh and did I mention they have a mix and match 6 pack section and outdoor seating as well!?!? Try it! You will love it"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The Buffalo Chicken and the Reuben are two of my favorites. They also have salads, soups, and desserts-cupcakes, whoopie pies, cheesecake and cookies. 

GREAT draft selection which mostly features local beers. Some solid national breweries as a comment. 

There is also a large selection of cold beers to go, make your own six pack. Bombers bottles are also available to go."}
{"text":"Thanks to fellow Yelpers, I was able to make the right choice and get the Donnie Brasco sandwich. I must admit I was a bit hesitant because egg salad and buffalo chicken together doesn't make sense, but when I took my first bite I was blown away. The bread is fresh, soft and slightly crunchy on the crust. Veggies are fresh and crisp not limp.
The pickle spear is a nice add on to give it a lil bite. 

Service is great. The guys and gals there were helpful and cheerful. Dude was the 'stash was super nice and provided great service.

Beer selection is ridiculous. Hey have beer flights which I would try next time when it's not work hours. Flight of 4 for $7. Good deal I say.

Parking just is well... It's Carson. Nuff said. But has not bearing on the deli itself. 

Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I would rate Carson Street Deli four and a half stars.

The beer selection here is quite funky. It focuses on local and craft options with some specialties brew styles which I haven't come across often. I opted for a cucumber beer from Voodoo. It paired incredibly well with the stuffed grape leaves from the deli section.

There are also a solid selection of bottled beers in addition to the great drafts, sandwiches, and sides. The atmosphere here is quieter than most other bars on Carson."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Carson St. Deli! The selection of local craft beer is wonderful and they have several coolers of beer selections to do a mixed six pack! The staff is always friendly and helpful when doing takeout / ordering via phone.

The bar area is great, rarely is too crowded but there's always a seat somewhere in the place. There are several TVs and it isn't the crazy atmosphere that most other Carson St. locations have during games so it's a great go-to spot to see some hockey!

Warm weather... the patio is amazing! It is so quiet and secluded that even on the craziest of party nights in the southside you still feel like you can enjoy your beer and sandwich in peace. I love the outdoor area, and there are probably close to 10 tables so it is spacious enough for larger groups.

And lastly, the food - Such great deli sandwiches, sides, and occasionally I'll try one of the desserts they have available. I haven't yet had the soup, but am never disappointed with anything I have there. The Club sandwich is my go-to, great meat ratio and the bread is perfect!

Helpful tip: sometimes they have extra bread loaves on the bar that they give away for free! Yes!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots in the Southside. Great beer selection, friendly staff, and the sandwiches are always delicious."}
{"text":"I got the Donnie brasco sandwich which was amazing. They had run out of the Italian bread so I had it on a baguette instead. I think it would be easier to eat on the Italian bread, but it was still delicious. My friend got the po' boy sandwich. We both agreed that it lacked crisp and had a not so pleasant fishy taste. We ended up just sharing my sandwich since it was so big. We also got a couple beers on tap that were delicious. If you are in the mood for a beer and sandwich I would totally check this place out."}
{"text":"So i was at another Yelp event here where we got to meet the owner and discuss his restaurant but more importantly his knowledge of beers. 

Mike the owner was a great man to talk to. He knew exactly what beer to recommend with a certain foods or which beer was in high regard over another. We got to sample so many from IPA's to Stouts and Amber Ale's to Ciders. My Favorite was definitely the Dog fish Ksavir. Great taste, very smooth and almost like a wine. That is what he compared it to as well. After sampling many brews I chose the dog fish as my go to beer. I really wanted the lapery's stout but it was a little too like coffee for me. 

We ate some pretzels from the pretzel shop with some homemade beer cheese from his wife. Man was that beer cheese awesome. You could totally taste the beer but it wasn't over powering. The cheese had that aged sharp cheddar flavor which is one of my favorites. We got a small bowl for our table of five. There's something about sharing cheese between 20+ people that doesn't sit right with me. You never know who maybe double dipping ya dig? Anyway, we ordered a sandwich but I'm sad to say I wasn't to pleased with it.

it was the sicilian with prosciutto, capicola, ham, red peppers, oil and oregano and genoa salami. The bread was a baguette which was extremely hard so i couldn't  enjoy eating it like a real sandwich. It didn't come with veggie toppings other than the red peppers so the sandwich was rather dry. I ended up just eating the bread with the oil and oregano which tasted a lot better than the sandwich entirely. The meat was a little too salty so i just threw it away. Lucky my hubby had the other half of the sandwich or all of it would have gone to waste.

I would definitely come back here for there local selection of beers but not so much the food. They were pretty busy too but my sisters ordered a crab cake sandwich that got cold from sitting near the register. When he said he would reheat it, he fingered the crab meat to test the warmth then put the half eaten patties back on the grill next to another customers sandwich. That is not practicing good hygiene no matter how hot the grille is. That one deserves a mister yuck sticker. I'm not blaming the owner because he practices great customer service but his employees who were sweating....Not so much.. Try to get here when it isn't busy!!"}
{"text":"I belong to a MeetUp group called \"Strange Brew\". We're a group of craft beer enthusiast who get together once a month and we each bring a beer that, hopefully, no one has tried before (that's the challenge, finding one during the weeks leading up to our MeetUp). We've been doing this for over three years, alternate between only two establishments; last night it was the Carson Street Deli. 

I got there at about 6:00, commandeered some tables and looked over the menu wondering what I would get tonight. After a few other members showed up, I decided on the Real New Yorker's New Yorker Sandwich that comes with a mixture of hot pastrami and corned beef topped with melted swiss and deli mustard on a grilled marbled rye. I also ordered a Lavery, Lá Bealtaine White Fire Wheat to compliment it. One of my fellow Strange Brew members ordered the Dizzy Lizzy which is a pita wrap with curried grilled chicken, fresh slaw, dried cranberries and sliced almonds.  She looked at my sandwich and I looked at hers and we decide to trade half of our sandwiches with each other. They were both amazing (if you can say that about a deli sandwich), super fresh and the right amount of ingredients presented with simplicity.  

Now can we talk about beer? Twenty craft beers on tap should be able to get you lubed up enough to make your way over to the cooler section where they stock over 300 craft beers. You can mix and match beers of your choosing and if you put together a six pack you get $2.00 off each beer. 

But what we (Strange Brew Meetup Members) like most about the place though is the atmosphere. This establishment is always spotlessly clean, the wait staff is extremely courteous and attentive and we, as a group, are always made to feel welcome each time we get together here.  What is also cool about the Carson Street Deli is that there's a patio out back with a garden like feel to it that we take advantage of during the warmer months to get away from the hustle and bustle that can be the South Side.  

If you can't tell by now, let me just say that I like it there. If you're in the South Side and looking for a good sandwich and a high end craft beer to swish it down with, I would highly recommend the Carson Street Deli. It's so much more than a \"deli\" thus deserving of a five star rating."}
{"text":"I love a good Reuben sandwich...
I even love a mediocre Reuben.

But Carson Street Deli's Reuben was like a breath of fresh air in my stuffy Reuben attic. The bread was fresh and bursting with marble-y rye goodness. The corned beef was sliced perfectly and piping hot with gooey swiss cheese. Topped off with delicious slaw and dressing. I would bet my beer that the dressing and slaw are made in house. Carson Street Deli just rolls that way (I think).

Sammies are $7.75 and very much worth it. Grab a beer or six as well and nom it up."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest and best subs I've had. The beefy cheesy is rad."}
{"text":"They make even the most simple sandwich awesome! First sandwich I had was a basic roast beef cold on a baguette, exactly what I was craving. Then I tried the Donnie Brasco - buffalo chicken + egg salad. Sounds weird but it was perfect. Only think I would change is the bread, not for taste, but for cleanliness. I made a mess all over the place with the sandwich, but at least this is one they give you a fork. The hubs had the cheesy beefy which he fell in love with. Oh yeah, and the beer selection is insane. Not your average deli, I must say."}
{"text":"My son has been after me for some time to go here so I took his advice and went. This place is remarkable! Upon entering there is a small bar area along with table seating. You place your order at the bar when it is for dine in or take out.

The counterperson then told me to help myself to whatever drink I wanted from the refrigerators in the back. As I headed back there I saw all types of beers from various Pittsburgh locales like Voodoo brewery to name one.

They also have a small meat counter where you can see some of the fresh meat they prepare and serve. The menu is expansive ranging from deli specials, salads, sides, soups, non-alcoholic beverages, and even a kids menu. Want to make it up yourself? Well they have create your own sandwich menu. Price is determined by what you choose but very reasonable. They also do catering.

So I decided to choose the \"Dizzy Lizzy.\" This wrap comes with curried grilled chicken, fresh slaw, dried cranberries, and slice almonds on a pita wrap. You get all this for $8.75. But wait. Between the hours of 12-4 you can get 1/2 sandwich, choice of side or soup for the price of a sandwich!  Among these sides they offer in addition to traditional you can find crab cake, broccoli carbonara, and baba ghanouj.  I opted for the traditional cole slaw.

I had my food served to me in no time and although it was a bit messy I loved every bite of it! After that I wanted a small dessert. Their sign says \"baked goods from three fifty.\" I asked if that was the price and was told that three fifty is where they get their desserts from. They even have cheesecake. I opted for the pumpkin pecan cupcake which was just enough for me. When I was done I went up to pay and asked how to dispose of my garbage. The counter person told me no worries, they would do it for me. My whole check came to under $15.00 but it was worth every penny.

I know this place probably gets crowded later on with the bar scene and the tremendous array of beer varieties they carry. The best time to visit would be on a weekday since it is much easier to park and get served but you can't go wrong anytime. The food is fresh and made to order. My son recommends next time I opt for \"the club\" sandwich which consists of smoked turkey, baked ham, blt, cheese and mayo on Italian bread. I think I will take him up on that suggestion next time.

The Carson Street Deli and Craft Beer Bar is located in the Southside directly across from the Amazing Cafe in the 1500 block of E. Carson St."}
{"text":"Got a Reuben with some chili. The chili was good. Nothing to write home about, but not bad at all. The Reuben on the other hand...BEST. REUBEN. EVER. I always order a Reuben when I go to a sandwich shop, being that I'm a huge fan of them. This is by far the best I've ever had. I want to eat one everyday. For breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"We got a (huge) sandwich each, and they're two of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.  We got the black-bean burger with added cheese, and the donnie brasco (buffalo chicken, egg salad, hot pickled peppers).  Everything was excellent, and I'm guessing the things we didn't try are excellent too."}
{"text":"Even if you're not conveniently located to the South Side, it would be well worth your time to check out Carson Street Deli! I've been there a handful of times. On my first visit, my boyfriend and I both ordered the Sicilian (to die for!). It reminded me of eating pepperoni pizza without all the grease and mess. We both loved it so much, we went back the very next day and tried something else (forget the name, but it was the same as the Sicilian but with salami). It was excellent, but I would still go with the Sicilian. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I've had the Hot Pastrami Mama and The Balboa here. Both were really tasty and the cold cuts were stellar. There's a link to the menu so I won't go into any depth over the individual ingredients in the sandwiches, but the Balboa had an awesome oil dressing. The bread is some of the better that I've had in Pittsburgh (that probably means something different to everyone). There is a $1 fee for making the sandwich into a panini- I didn't opt for this, and I don't think I missed out. Each time I went I used a groupon so my perspective on the prices is a little skewed. I believe the sandwiches range from 6.50-8.00. That price range may be a bit steep for what is about an 8 inch sub, but it's much better quality than subway/quiznos. So if you're going for taste over quantity, I recommend. The staff is real cool, too."}
{"text":"You know I remember when this place was down the street a bit and literally just a deli. I would be in at least once a week for a made-to-order sandwich of deliciousness. When they upgraded a few years back it seemed to be for the better. Nice space, beer/drink choices and menu. I'll admit while it's improved I've only been back a handful of times for dining in. I usually run in there for a six pack when heading to a party in the area. I guess with so many new and better places this has become one where I have the \"been there/done that\" mentality. Nothing spectacular or horrible it's just kind of there."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here tonight.

We ordered the Montezuma's Revenge the Hot Pastrami Mama and a cup of the portobello mushroom soup.

Everything was delicious and fresh.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came for the sandwiches and stayed for the beer! 

It's great the renovations that have gone into this little deli. Over the last year they've added a beautiful new bar and added to the patio out back. I don't know what more they could do other than buy the whole block! 

My go to is always the chicken salad sandwich. I love me a good chicken salad. Like the one with mayo. I say the one with mayo pointedly because I LOVE MAYO! And a lot of it. So if I order a chicken salad sandwich I want a good amount of mayo. I always try to duplicate them at home and it never has the flavor that this does. Plus, I love the Breadworks bread! i could eat a whole loaf and be one happy camper.

I also think they have a nice selection of sides as well. I usually go for the tomato and cucumber salad, but I'll switch it up with coleslaw or potato salad once in a while. I try not to go too mayo heavy on the sides since I get my fill in the sammie! But there's a good amount to try from including pasta salads or you can grab some chips. 

I think it's so cool the owner Mike's dedication to local brews. All of his taps are 100% local. Local as in, around the Western part of PA (Erie included... holla!). We've got some good places to choose from, that's for sure! Plus, he does samplings on Wednesdays and hosts regular nights were the reps come in and talk up their brews. 

If you can't stay you can also browse the 300+ bottles of beer they sell to take home. So you've got lots of different options. All of which hopefully end up with beer involved! So basically, if you're a craft brew aficionado, you must stop in here! Oh, and if you like sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"Great beer place with good sandwiches. Slightly disappointed at the lack of French fries on the menu.  Potato salad is excellent. Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"Best subs in Pittsburgh and one of the better craft beer refrigerators in town. Also they have the best vegetarian hoagie in town by far. Ask them to skip the black olives though. Unless that's you're into that type of thing."}
{"text":"The food was good and the atmosphere was cute for a deli. Upon the recommendation from the waitress I got the Bourne Farm and it was quite delicious. It was raining so I could not enjoy the beer garden out back, but I will certainly return to check it out."}
{"text":"We decided to eat lunch here for a friend's birthday, and the second we walked in the waitress on at the time seemed as if we were a nuisance. Throughout our meal there, she acted as if she had better things to do than wait on us even though the entire restaurant was empty except for me and my friends. The one sandwich my friend ordered took 10 minutes longer to come out than the rest of the food , even though we saw it had already been prepared and was sitting on the back shelf of the kitchen. The waitress who was just standing in the kitchen talking to the staff, and occasionally waking out to check on the restaurant only brought the sandwich to my friend once we asked her if i was still being made. Then once we were ready to leave, we tipped her (even though we shouldn't have for how rude she was) and she acted as if she wanted us to leave. Not once did we do anything to make her angry. Absolutely awful. Will never go back again because of that woman."}
{"text":"Love their menu!!!  So many delicious options!  I tried the Cuban sandwich and while it was good, I wish they would've pressed it.  It wasn't a deal breaker though.  Their beer list is impressive as well and they offer many options from local Pittsburgh breweries.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The obsession that I had with this place while pregnant is indescribable. It's AMAZING.  Why? It just is. I think it's because they keep everything simple using high quality ingredients and therefor delicious. Delicious breads, reals meats, great cheeses, and they're all made to order and made right there in front of you. BAM! One beautiful meal is created.  
On your first visit, get ready to stand there in awe of the selections. Making up ones mind is almost impossible at times. Personally I love their cheese & vegetarian sandwiches because it's not easy to make them to the perfection that's been accomplished by CSD. 
The food is just so good."}
