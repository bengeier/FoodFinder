{"text":"This place right here is something everyone in Cleveland needs to stop by and try. I have tried the Brisket on Texas toast, and it is phenomenal. Great smokey taste with the perfect amount of seasoning. Their cornbread is also great. For sure will be back for this and to try out some other options. 5 stars, well done."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic BBQ, best in Cleveland by far. Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I do not take the time to write many reviews, but this place deserves the time. I finished my second round here today, it is Awesome.  So far I have tried the Pork, brisket, Mac & Cheese, BBQ Baked Beans, and cornbread.  All of them have been delicious with the pork on the top of my list.  Keep doing what you are doing!!  Prices work well for what you get in portion and quality.  I only wish they offered a two meat combination plate a lower price point with smaller portions of meat if needs be."}
{"text":"We chose Boney Fingers BBQ for lunch today based on reviews we read. It's located in in the Arcade by the Hyatt. It's basically set up like ordering in a food court, but what it lacked in ambiance, it more than made up for with perfect brisket, really good hand cut fries, and some tasty baked beans. I feel the need to try other places in Cleveland while we are here, but I could absolutely see myself becoming a regular if I was around more. Good work guys."}
{"text":"I work at sushi restaurant nearby Bonny Finger  My little girls Mc cheese and waffle. Also the three men are very nice. I love this place."}
{"text":"First visit and definitely not my last!!  Amazing BBQ with authentic sides and great portions!!  Today I ordered the two meat with two side,  expecting to get small sample size portions like everywhere e kg se.  Not so here!!!!    Great size enter portions of Pulled pork and melt in your mouth Brisket.  I ordered the baked beans and mac and cheese with cornbread on the side.  I would have added pics but,  I already done so deep into this meal that their current state would not do justice.  Everything was perfectly flavored (in my opinion),  the two sauces I tried on the side were great! I will be back for sure and I regret that u put off visiting here for so long.    Easy to get to location, very friendly cashier who answered my questions with a smile and to the guy who I assume was the manager or owner who talked to me before I left and made sure to let me know that they are serving Smoked Corner Beef all day this Saturday for St. Patrick's Day!!!  For the first time In a while I'm happy I am working down the street that day!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today.  I had the pulled pork.  I have to say it was the best pulled pork I had ever tasted.  I sampled the brisket as well and the flavor was amazing.  Will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical when the critics rave about a new BBQ joint, but this place deserves the praise.  Came in for lunch and had the brisket, one rib bone, mac and cheese, and baked beans.  The meat's bark and flavor was outstanding.  Didn't need any sauce at all, which is a good thing as if there is any knock against this place it's their BBQ sauces are nothing to write home about.  But with meat this good, you don't need to.  The sides were crazy good.  Mac & Cheese was to die for and the baked beans were the best I ever had.  A bit on the sweet side, but nothing that some good hot sauce can't fix!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great prices!  Had the pulled pork sandwich and my boyfriend had the ribs. We would recommend both. Also loved the mac and cheese. So delicious."}
{"text":"Had a hard time finding the place and then they were not open at noon on Saturday even though website says they should be.  Call before you come."}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome! Don't be discouraged about eating in the \"food court\" it's totally worth it. Hard to find, tucked away inside the building with no obvious sign on the main road, once you find this gem you will return."}
{"text":"this is one of the best, if not the best BBQ ribs I have ever had in the Cleveland area. Mac and cheese is great as well, but absolutely the best baked beans I've ever had, these beans are simply as good as it gets."}
{"text":"BBQ for really great value in the lower level of the historic Cleveland arcade. Seriously, the breakfast brisket hash is less than $10 and a huge portion. Probably one of the best briskets around in Cleveland. The only issue is that they're open only for breakfast and lunch with service ending around 2pm. Great for a breakfast or lunch meeting downtown. Do not miss this little stand!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's really difficult to find if you don't already know about it, though. Very hard to stumble upon them.  This place is hidden down in the old Arcades and has pretty restricted hours because of their location. They do breakfast, ribs, pulled pork, bbq chicken, you name it.  Hopefully they can find a new place soon and open up their hours! I'd love to be able to grab this for dinner sometimes."}
{"text":"Awesome service by the guys here. I had trouble trying to figure out my Apple Pay but they hooked me up. Had the brisket which was amazing and will be back for the baby back ribs."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Had pulled pork (so fresh and tender), egg whites and toast. They gave me a sample of the brisket which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Delicious. My buddy had a brisket wrap with eggs. He loved it. Come here! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is GOOD!  I ordered the Boney Fingers version of a Polish Boy and OMG it was SOOOO good!  Freshly toasted Orlando Bun (can't go wrong with an Orlando Bun:-), tasty smoked sausage, topped with yummy pulled pork, homemade slaw and barbecue sauce.  The sandwich was HUGE and you can't beat the price, $6.  I cant wait to return"}
{"text":"First time in Ohio, and was looking for a place that catered to beef eaters. My boyfriend located this joint. I had the hash with brisket-AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I would have discovered this gem earlier.  We stopped in for breakfast and were very surprised!  Make sure you get the breakfast sausage.   Will definitely be back to try the lunch BBQ.  The menu is inviting and very reasonable!  The staff is amazing and helpful.   This location is a little tricky to find.....but make a point to get there"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think that a bbq joint would have such a stellar breakfast, but this place certainly does. Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection, and the owner was a delight to talk to. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for four days and this was our favorite meal (by far).  Just wish we had gone at the start of our trip rather than the last day.  Everything we had was terrific (and there were 5 of us so we had a little bit of everything).  I'll start with the smoked brisket - sooo juicy and tasty.  I got the brisket hash and it was amazing.  Sample the various sauces that are available - guessing they make their sauces because the were so flavorful and unique.  The mac and cheese was the best we have had in any city.  Don't skip the loaded fries - piled high with bacon and cheese.  For breakfast I added a pancake ($1.49) and it was as big as the container it came in - and delicious.  Give this place a try - kind of tucked away and unassuming but don't let that fool you.  It is worth the trouble of finding it.  The price was right too - $52 for all of us and we got extra sides and everything.  One of the owners took our order and was super friendly and helpful - even let us sample the brisket before we committed! Hope these young guys who took on this venture get the recognition they deserve."}
{"text":"It's no fluke that at the time of writing, this place has received straight 5-star reviews.  I was a little hesitant to try bbq for breakfast, but glad I bit the bullet.  I had brisket with hash browns & 2 eggs, reasonably priced, and excellent quality! They're located on the bottom level inside this stunning building."}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast place and wandered into the Arcade on Euclid.  And what a great find in Bony Fingers.  Excellent waffle and fried chicken.  The brisket is very tender with a good selection of sauces.  Good portions.  Just go downstairs!"}
{"text":"These people make a great breakfast at a great price. Try the brisket hash, it is a hearty meal! Highly recommended place in the bottom of the Arcade."}
{"text":"Amazing! I had the pulled pork with coleslaw and  mac & cheese.   -pulled pork: phenomenal!  -coleslaw: delicious! -mac & cheese: 5/10, needed more flavor -Texas toast: not the best but didn't need it  The BBQ sauce on the side was great and added the perfect flavor to the pulled pork, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A-mazing.  Deserves ALL the stars!  The reviews are to be believed.  Had the brisket hash with two eggs.  Shouldn't eaten all of it, but I did.  It was fantastic!  Great crispiness on the hash.  Succulent brisket and not just a little but a LOT mixed in with the potatoes.  Tasty smokiness to the brisket."}
{"text":"First of all, the staff was SO pleasant and helpful which is always refreshing. I was a little wary at first due to its \"hole in the wall\" appearance, but wow am I glad I gave it a chance! I got the brisket hash- Hands down best brisket I've ever had! I tried the Mac and cheese which was authentic and awesome as well. The sauces were amazing but not even necessary- there's already so much flavor going on. The only thing I'm disappointed about is the fact that I am leaving Cleveland today and will not have a chance to come back for dinner. Within my four day stay I've visited several restaurants and this place is hands down the best (and cheapest) place I've been! 10/10 would recommend ;)"}
{"text":"Today was my first time there pressured by a friend. And I have to say. Damn near perfect ribs! Very tender and moist not too Smokey with the perfect amount of pull from the bone! Great job guys!   I might have had the pulled pork entree which wasn't a joke either. Same moist great texture. Great sauce also better mid southern Carolina sauce (I would recommend)"}
{"text":"YEP YEP YEP. 5 stars without a doubt. I stand by everything I wrote before, but i'm finally adding that 5th star because I finally had the opportunity to visit in-person. Also, they are so consistent and kill it every time, whether in-person or via delivery. You can count on them to be as equally delicious as the last meal you had.  I think is the best bbq in downtown Cleveland, which I realize is a bold statement. The meat is expertly cooked. The pulled pork and brisket are tender and juicy. The portions are beyond generous (I always have to double-take my bill, because their prices are so fair, unlike some other places). The best sides are the cole slaw, french fries, and cornbread, and 2 sides come standard with every entree. Everything is melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Come hungry when you're eating from Boney Fingers, because you'll be surprised how easy it is to love every bite. The folks in their location are beyond friendly and the service is outstanding. Don't wait, get yourself now there! You'll be craving it non-stop. You're welcome."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and were given a sample of their BBQ by the staff. The BBQ was so delicious. I wish that we would have chosen this place for lunch or dinner, rather than breakfast. Super friendly staff too. The only negative is the location, but they said that they're looking for a different space. Voted the best new restaurant in 2017, they are worth checking out."}
{"text":"The best ever pork belly ever!!!  Crispy, intense pop of that belly fat in your mouth.  Omg Dam# the torpedos and calories!!!  In 2 hours the bbq baby ribs are gone and so is the chicken!  Come by 1p or it's goner.  Non descript best bbq in Cleveland and beats SF Bay Area!  No kidding"}
{"text":"Finally, a great BBQ joint in Cleveland that doesn't cost an arm and a leg!  I went at the end of the day, but they still had just enough meat left over for a combo platter.  I had the pulled pork and the brisket.  Both were perfectly juice and smokey, with the pulled pork having just the right amount of crispy bark!  None of the meat comes pre-doused in BBQ sauce, which in my book is a BBQ cardinal sin.  They also don't neglect their sides (another BBQ cardinal sin - I'm looking at you Proper Pig) with obvious care taken to make sure they are not just an afterthought.  I had the coleslaw (not too much mayo, which is key), baked beans (sweet and bacon-y, as they should be) and the mac n cheese (perfectly cheesy and creamy).  Portions are very generous as well, so no one will leave hungry.  I look forward to going back and trying the ribs!  Save yourself the trouble and take the 50% discount off Mabel's prices - cross the street and go over to the Cleveland Arcade to visit Boney Fingers - you'll be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"My wife and and I were out early on vacation walking around downtown Cleveland and I came across a BBQ place that serves breakfast! Awesome!  I ordered the pulled pork with two sunny side up eggs with pulled pork, toast, and hash browns.  The guy that I am guessing is the owner is super cool and it was ready in about 5 minutes. The pork was super juicy and melded perfectly with the eggs. A little smokey and the hash browns were solid, but I only had a few bites, because they give you about a pound of them.  For seating, it is in a mall like building, so they have tables nearby that you can eat at, kind of like a food court.  You have to love BBQ in the morning, and I would return here in an instant! Especially at 8 AM!"}
{"text":"I had a groupon for them and used it today.. I have to say there food is amazing from the babyback ribs to the boney boy.... I will be returning veey soon.."}
{"text":"Has a food court feel which surprised me in this luxurious looking building, but the food didn't disappoint. The polish boys were great and the *baked* Mac n cheese was on point! Prices were great as well."}
{"text":"Best BBQ joint downtown by a mile. Sorry Mabel's. Brisket is amazing, portions are generous, sauce options are wide but each bringing something unique, service is quick, and prices are very reasonable. My one wish is that the expanded to include some sort of dinner service because I crave good BBQ 24/7. But I can safely say that downtown Cleveland now has a player in the BBQ market that isn't some trendy disappointment like Mabel's."}
{"text":"I was up in Cleveland for a conference and decided to try this place for lunch.   Being from Texas, I was skeptical of the BBQ prowess up here but decided to give it a try with all the great reviews.   I was humbled! This place is great. I ordered the pulled pork and brisket with mac n cheese.   Seriously top notch. The mustard BBQ sauce goes great with the pork.   It's a bit tricky to find. It's in the food court of the arcade which is downstairs in the back corner.   Totally worth the hunt!"}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue place in Cleveland.  I've been to Mabel's multiple times and boney fingers knocks Mabel's out of the park.  For $10 it's my favorite lunch spot downtown.  They're gonna need to find a new space soon, the line is always long and so is the wait.  Always worth it though!"}
{"text":"Stopped by at Boney Fingers for breakfast before a conference in Cleveland. Given the solid five star review, I felt like I had to check this place out. Wasn't disappointed in the least and would definitely go back again.   I ordered the brisket hash with two eggs sunny side. The guy behind the counter told me they didn't have enough brisket because they pile it on and I should order something else. Props to them for being straight up and honest. Went with the brisket hash anyways and was very deliciously full after. Had a mix of the bbq sauces as well and never knew it all went so well with breakfast. Would recommend if you're downtown and looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Dayum, that's great BBQ! Not too salty, perfectly smoked. Wow!  I had a huge and delicious pulled pork sandwich that knocked my socks off. My coworker enjoyed a brisket sandwich. The sandwiches were oversized and they had little bits of burned meat that were just out of this world. The side of mac n cheese was tasty, but I think it would be better if it was smoked. I also tried the baked beans, which were excellent.  Some BBQ joints use salty dry rubs that leave me guzzling water after I eat at them. But not Boney Fingers. They're all about the smoke. The meat was moist, tender, and delicious. This is probably the best BBQ I've ever had and my co-worker concurred.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A fantastic, quick, delicious, yet inexpensive breakfast option. I stayed at the Hyatt during my business travel and was recommended by several to try this place out for lunch. Unfortunately I wasn't around during their lunch hours but their breakfast is next to none. Best part is you can get their ridiculously tender and juicy meats with your breakfast too!   I believe I stopped by here 3 of the 5 days I was in Cleveland and the food was fantastic every time. I had their eggs, hash, pulled pork, and pulled chicken. The pulled pork was very flavorful and the pulled chicken was incredibly juicy. The fact that I was able to have a very filling and protein filled breakfast for no  more than $6.99 is amazing.   This is the only place to go for breakfast in Cleveland, and I plan to return every morning the next time I'm in town. They deserve nothing less than 5 stars"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick cheap eat, this would be a great spot. Their service was excellent! We ordered brisket with two sides and a chicken sandwich. On top of that, their sauces were very good too. I had to say that the pull chicken was a little dry for me but that might also because I ordered it by the end of the day. Overall I'd recommend this place"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ...if not the best in the Cleveland area. The prices are great and you get large portions. I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Ever watch BBQ shows on tv? And what good, no great barbecue and brisket is.  Well people, the brisket that I ate here is right up there!  Best brisket that I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"I'm just gonna say it... skip Mabel's and just come here. The bbq is just as good if not better and is such a good value for the portion size. They have several different combination options; for example, you can opt for any of their meats as a sandwich on Texas toast, or you can order it as an entree with two sides. They also have an option where you can get two meats combined with sides. Suffice it to say, whatever your appetite or budget size, Boney Fingers has gotcha covered. I've tried both the ribs and the brisket and they were both really tender (and between you and me, great leftover!). In addition, I was fairly impressed with their sides. You'll get a thick slice of white bread if you opt for the entree version, but you can also get cornbread if you prefer. Their cole slaw is quite creamy but full of crispy cabbage, not the tiny bits of cabbage you typically get at bbq joints. The mac and cheese is not bad, it can come across as lacking in flavor, but it's still okay in my opinion. I have already been back here a few times and I find it's very convenient for those in the downtown area. I should mention that although they don't have fountain drinks, they have a decent selection of bottled and canned beverages. Boney Fingers is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something quick and easy for lunch."}
