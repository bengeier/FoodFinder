{"text":"My boyfriend and I have birthdays two days apart.  So, we get a week long celebration.  My dad wanted to take us out for dinner and he likes Vibo and hadn't been in a while, since he moved out of the neighbourhood.  We were pumped, who doesn't like free food, birthdays and not having to travel to another area code for dinner?   The food was pretty good, though the tomatoes in the salads we ordered were quite cold. My pasta special was delicious, in fact I'm trying to hold off eating my leftovers right now (it's 9:15 am).  Mmmm tomatoes, red onions, rapini and sausage!  We were too full to have dessert. I took one star off because they tried to sit me with my \"party\" unfortunately I had no idea who those three women were!  Luckily I found the people I knew : )"}
{"text":"The ambiance and decor of this place is what I'm looking for in an Italian restaurant; intimate and romantic.  The staff is super friendly and helpful, and the wine list was way more than I knew what to do with, but I would think a connoisseur would be impressed.  I need to start doing these reviews closer to my visits to the restaurant so that I have a better memory of food specifics, but I do remember the food was excellent.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience.. food was A1, service was just right and my choice of wine turned out to be an absolute winner!! Too bad, you cant get it in the LCBO :(    Mclaren Vale Shiraz 2008 - Chateau Reynella  If someone can get me this wine, I'll take a case!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to vibe several times and I would go again and again. I've yet to have a dish I wasn't thrilled with and even if I wasn't they would make it right by remaking it or bringing me something else.  The vibe there is nice...the servers know what they are talking about and make good wine suggestions. The owners will usually come by and make sure everything to to your liking  Don't expect a cheap meal but do expect quality"}
{"text":"Vibo is fine dining.  Every meal i have had there was hot, tasted fantastic and i've never had bad service there, although i have had a wierd server a couple of times that made inaproppriate jokes. the soup with gorganzola/leek is fantastic.  i highly recommend it.  the pastas are great.  a few times that ive had the lamb it wasnt cooked exactly as i had ordered it, but overall this is one of my favourite restaurants in toronto and i reccomend it highly.   If you go on a birthday they will sing happy birthday for you and the \"big guy\" is the loudest of all.   Downsides- smarmy piano music in the back; patron volume can be very loud at times."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night. Randomly selected this place for a date night while we were walking on Bloor. We were definitely satisfied with the environment, atmosphere, service & food quality. I mean this spot hit every aspect we were looking for.   We ordered the salumi board for the starter and we loved it. For the Mains we ordered the Rabbit & the Full Rack of Lamb. Both of these dishes were jaw dropping good even the mashed potatoes and veggies had a great taste. Once we ordered the food it did take a little while to come out, but definitely worth the wait as everything is made fresh to order. For dessert we ordered the creme brule and the sorbet & gelato. The dessert was amazing and I loved the smoothness of the creme brule and the creaminess of the sorbet and gelato.   We will definitely be back. This place is a little pricey, but for a date night it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"I am a returning customer over and over again to Vibo, I have never had a bad meal here, the rack of lamb is my fav though! Mmmm If you like a great wine list Vibo is the place to be, and the waiters always make excellent suggestions to pair with the food you order. Service is great, the waiters treat you really special and even know us when we come in. Seems like its a good place to work because most of the waiters have been there for years and years!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with a few friends. To start, we had the calamari, which was fried, but not too greasy which was good.  For mains, my husband and I had the Cheese Crespelle and Allesia's Stuffed Chicken. Both were really good. The crespelle was a spinach/cheese crepe served in a rose sauce.I had wanted the Homemade Goat Cheese and Portobello Agnilotti but they weren't serving that last night so I was a bit disappointed. The portion sizes were just enough - nobody had leftovers.   Service was ok, not particularly outstanding; prices are reasonable considering the ambiance/area/quality. I probably would have rated it 4 stars had it not been for the pushy waiter at the end who was trying to get us to order dessert/coffee. We were really full from the meal so didn't want dessert but he was being a bit pushy which I found off-putting."}
{"text":"Good meal, good atmosphere. Waiter had good sense of humor, told us that sparkling water had round bubbles.  Their rendition of happy birthday puts all others to shame."}
{"text":"Caesar salad was great. Homemade dressing was very nice.   I got linguini with clams in white wine sauce, was pretty good.   My friend got he linguini and meatballs. The meatball was not homemade, was actually packaged which was a bit disappointment considering it was followed up by the Caesar salad which was amazing. They said it was braised in tomatoes and fresh basil. But we found no basil and just the meatballs was a bit too smooth and round and you can taste that it wasn't freshly made in house. Tomato sauce was pretty good tho, not too bad. They claimed the pasta was homemade but DEFINITELY was not. The pasta however was good packaged pasta.   Desert had such little options, really the only desert they had that we might consider was the tiramisu and we didn't want that.   We're giving three stars mainly because of their claims. Homemade pasta (lie) and homemade meatballs (lie) but everything else was great"}
{"text":"In this neighborhood, this is the best I have tried -- and it was great. We went for my son's birthday. The atmosphere was formal but not overly so. When we were there, the pianist was not playing. The conversation of the other guests was muted, and so it was a pleasant place to talk as we had dinner - we didn't have to yell.    The wine list was fairly reasonably priced, and the wine was good. Appetizers - we had a leek soup and bruschetta. Both were flavorful, but the bread for the bruschetta was ordinary.  But the mains! All our main dishes were truly delicious, beautifully presented, and just the right amount of food. Service was attentive without being fawning. Prices were not cheap, but quite reasonable.   Everything was comfortable and elegant, delicious but not pretentious. I will happily return for any occasion, or when we have out of town guests."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 of my girlfriends because one of them lives nearby. The reviews seemed positive, so I thought it would be a pleasant experience. We had a reservation for 8pm and were ignored in the front lobby, along with a crowd of people also waiting, until 8:25. The restaurant was slammed and clearly understaffed. When I asked if our table was in fact reserved, the host refused to answer the question and said we could go somewhere else if we wanted. I know he was visibly frustrated because of his current workload, but he should get therapy or a new job and try not to immediately take it out on customers.   We were seated 45 minutes after our reservation time, and then it took another 30 minutes for a waiter to take orders, or bring water. In fact, they brought appetizers before bringing water. They explained they were out of clean water glasses. I could see the Shoppers Drug Mart through the window and thought of going there for 4 bottles of water.   More time passed. I thought the food must be amazing if all these people were willing to wait 2 hours after their reservation time to eat. I was wrong. This bruschetta and pasta sauce were totally bland and seem like they are from a jar, the pasta is not fresh, the gnocchi may or may not have contained potato, the gorgonzola sauce did not contain gorgonzola, and the whole time it was clear that all employees but one waitress hated my guts. So I am going to assume there was also a lot of spit in my food.   To be honest, what bothered me the most was that the people were so rude to me because I was trying to pay them to eat there.   The next morning the restaurant cancelled my reservation (retroactively) on Opentable, so I can't review them on that website. Sneaky a***holes.   DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"A restaurant floating in the 90's. A loner in the city which has no equal. Quality service but the food did not match either the prices or the service level. I ordered mussels as an appetizer. They came with 2 tablespoons of broth. They were characterless with no taste. My main Branzini was overcooked and over buttered. I can see Vibo probably has a loyal clientele who enjoy the 90's era and that sure is culinary democracy.  Suresh Chawla Toronto"}
{"text":"I've been coming to VIBO for years. The service and atmosphere can't be beat. Great selection of red wines. I always order the eggplant parmigiana. It comes out perfect every time!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night date. The atmosphere was nice. It's romantic, cozy, had a live piano player. Our server was nice enough, but I am going to say I get a bit miffed when servers treat me and my boyfriend like we're too young to be in such a place. This isn't uncommon for our apparently young looking appearances, but we're 29 and 30, were dressed to the nines, and acting appropriately. Regarding the meal, they didn't have the wine we requested in stock, but were able to recommend a replacement that suited my tastes so that was good. The starter bread was not bad, crunchy outside, sort of dry inside. They provided oil and vinegar. We got the beef carpaccio as an appetizer, one of my favourite dishes, I've had many, and it was quite good, probably the hero of the evening. My main, though, left something to be desired. I got the penne a la vodka with pancetta. It had one, count it, one small cube of pancetta and it was cold when it came out. I probably wouldn't spend the money to come here again."}
{"text":"We had dinner consisting of poached pear and gorganzola salad, calamari sorrentino (pan fried with olives etc.)  shared mushroom risotto (perhaps the best I've ever had), beef tenderloin medalians (nightly special), rack of lamb (also one of the best rack ever, with 7 chops).    The portions were large, the quality was excellent.  price was good for all that food plus a few drinks:  $148 incl tax.  Service was exceptional too.  Live music provided by grand piano.    It is not cheap by any means, but with the quality so high, it is a good value.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Valentine's Day! Great service and extremely delicious food from the appetizers to dessert! Its one of the best Italian restaurants in Toronto that I know of! It's a hidden gem"}
{"text":"I need to start this review by saying that I have NEVER been to a restaurant as happy as this one. Now you might ask what was so happy about this place? Well it's simple. EVERYTHING.   The service was some of the best I have had in an incredibly long time. The staff were always coming by to tell a story or to hear ours. They were quick with suggestions and just genuinely loved working here. (says something for the management right?!)  The atmosphere was lively and energetic but still intimate enough that you can enjoy a first date (or last!) and be satisfied. The piano player in the middle of the restaurant was a beautifully added touch to the whole environment.  The wine list was impeccable. My advice on this one, bypass the wines by the glass as they are low on the totem pole and go outside your comfort zone. You may be surprised as what you may find here. Also, let them recommend something. I promise you that the servers here know how to serve a drink.  Now for the BEST part, the Food. I had the Calamari to start which was everything I was craving. I then had the mushroom risotto which was probably some of the best risotto I've ever had. Everyone at the table was salivating over every course that was put on the table. I tried my friend's gnocchi. Let me say this about their gnocchi. If you have never had gnocchi in your life, do not go here to try it first. It will ruin you for any and all future gnocchi dining experiences. It's amazing.  My advice on the food as well, wait until they tell you the specials (there will be several!) before making your selection.   Lastly, save room for dessert. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. I promise.  It does NOT get much better than this place. And if you are looking for a round table dining experience, this place accommodates it!  I will be forever changed about my \"sighs\" when I have to go to the west end because of this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! Lovely home feel ambiance, great service, reasonable prices (definitely go there for their Winterlicious prix fixe menu) , and incredible food!  Every thing is delicious - seriously. I have been there twice and was always pleased! :)"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Friday. The service was amazing, had two servers and both were incredible assertive and friendly. Ordered the special which started white bean soup with kale - DELICIOUS. Our main was fettuccine with mushrooms rippini and beef.  Very fairly priced and delicious. I don't have any complaints about this restaurant. It was very clean and had a beautiful atmosphere. I would come back anytime !"}
{"text":"Had a birthday party for my husband on Saturday night at Vibo. Only disappointment was that they weren't able to add a few last minute guests(I called the night before and could not have 2 people added) Everything besides that was wonderful! Food was fantastic but what always impresses me is great service especially for a group of 18. Our waiter was attentive, prompt and had a great sense of humour. Food portions were a bit on the small side but that might be because I ordered from the Winterlicious menu. Live piano music added to the liveliness of the evening. All our guests were happy and gave rave reviews. We will be back."}
{"text":"We were tight on time since we wanted to catch a movie afterwards back in the heart of Toronto so when we placed our orders with the server, I specified that we had to be out of there by 8:45 p.m. (we walked in at 7:20 p.m. and placed our orders by 7:30 p.m.). The server acknowledged my request (it was also noted on the last page of the menu to inform the staff of any time restraints so it was a good idea that I did).  Unfortunately, by 8 p.m., our food still hadn't arrived yet. (It just so happened that we had all ordered from the pasta section of the menu -- so I couldn't understand why pasta dishes were taking so long to be ready.) We had been waiting for half an hour by that point. At 8:03 p.m., the server came around to tell us that our food would be arriving in about 3 or 4 minutes. That was fine. Unfortunately again, the truth was that it took a lot longer, almost seven times the number of what he told us, because it wasn't until 8:20 p.m. that our food finally arrived. I kept track of this because we were tight on time and had specifically told the server that we had to be out by 8:45 p.m. In the end, we ended up waiting for an entire hour for our food to arrive from start to finish.... The time that we had to wait for our food to arrive was even longer than the time we actually sat there eating...  Anyway, I had ordered a Homemade Goat Cheese & Portobello Filled Agnolotti with a black truffle cream sauce.  When it arrived, I was shocked to see that it was such a small portion on my plate.  There were only four agnolotti on my plate...  Compared to the portion sizes that our friends received for their pasta dishes, this agnolotti dish was extremely small.  I do recognize that it contained black truffle and goat cheese though -- pricier ingredients, but I still felt that the portion should have been more substantial."}
{"text":"The short rib entree and the pasta marinara was absolutely delicious- highly recommend them. Fresh food, most of the pasta is made in house which is really nice. Portions are not pretentious at all."}
{"text":"Honest to God, Vibo just might be worth what it costs to dine there. Beautiful restaurant, warm atmosphere, staff who treat you like family and know when to be available and when to disappear, and exquisite food. Last visit, we split an appetizer plate of their homemade gnocchi and had the rack of lamb and veal piccata entrees. All of it was literally 'melt in your mouth' perfect. I've never had a bad experience here and recommend it without reservation."}
{"text":"It was the lady friend's birthday and she was feeling like eating Italian so we decided to try out Vibo and this restaurant turned out being the perfect atmosphere for a birthday date. It was our first time going to Vibo and I must say the service was top notch, starting from the polite gentleman at the door that led us to our table, to our meticulous waiter whom took great care of us making sure everything was exactly to our liking. What I really loved about Vibo was the atmosphere, I really liked how the restaurant was lit up with dimly warm colored lights and at each table there were candles, along with the grand piano playing in the background and the odd but intriguing decor made it a very pleasant experience. We started with the Crisp Fried Calamari which I really loved and recommend as an appetizer, the calamari was a lot thicker than I have had at other restaurants but surprisingly tender. For our main course we had the Linguine \"alla Marinara\" which had a lot of seafood on it, but for some reason my dish did not come with scallops as stated in the menu but my girlfriend's dish did, so I told our waiter about this and he apologized and came back with a plate that had two large scallops and some extra mussels and clams. When my girlfriend went to the washroom the waiter quickly came to me and confirmed her name and not long after she returned a Tiramisu in a glass with a single candle came out to surprise her. This was a very enjoyable experience and I definitely recommend it to those who want to have a great Italian dinner with the best service in a great warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a great meal! This is my second dining experience here and each time was superb! Tonight I had the apple pecan salad with goat cheese to start. Perfectly tart apple slices with fresh greens and generous dollops of goat cheese-yum. My main course was the seared scallops and prawns. I couldn't go wrong choosing this dish. Tender, succulent scallops on a bed of sautéed spinach with some roasted potatoes and other perfectly cooked veggies. My dining companion had the calamari to start and the seafood linguini and he loved his choices as well. We both had dessert-chocolate molten cake for me and tiramisu for him. The tiramisu was deconstructed and appeared in a wine glass. I'm not sure if he loved it but I loved my cake with its fresh berries, premium vanilla ice cream and warm dark chocolate cake. It was the perfect end to a delicious meal. For wine I had the Italian Chardonnay (served by the glass) to start (lovely, crisp, slightly sweet ) and the Jester Shiraz to follow which was a delightful fruity full bodied Shiraz."}
{"text":"First class establishment with awesome ambiance and a piano player on a full grand piano. Fine dining at its best with impeccable service and wonderful hosts. The food is awesome, worth every penny. There are always great specials and a great wine selection. In an area with some other great dining choices."}
{"text":"NO NO NO As soon as you see FINE DINING in reviews ( circa 1973)you know the audience' Not good. Wine junk Waiters amateur  Kidneys 3rd rate Cold old zablione Help. Mother!!!"}
{"text":"I was quite impressed by Vibo.  The food was amazing and the staff was helpful and extermely freindly.  I felt like I was welcomed into their house.  Starting with the Eggplant Parmigiana set the stage.  The tomato sauce was simple and flavourful.  It felt like another.  For dinner, the roasted rack of lamb melted in my mouth.  I would order it again, but maybe after I work my way through the rest of the menu.  I will be back!  And I am sure it will be an internal battle on whether I have the Eggplant Parmigiana again or I try another app."}
{"text":"I ordered their bruschetta and fried calamari as an appetizer (opposed to many other options which were equally if not more appealing). They turned out to be absolutely phenomenal. I then ordered their lobster risotto which absolutely blew my mind. The server I had was so welcoming, and polite. I would definitely recommend this restaurant! Loved it"}
{"text":"This was a birthday party that was upstairs in the restaurant.   When we arrived there wasn't any food ready at the time. When the food started to come out it was all tasty but the portion sizes were rather small. There were spring rolls, wontons, coconut shrimp, bruschetta & a couple of others. All good but none great. This is why I have it a 3*.   One thing did stand out...the wait staff were solid. Very attentive & always willing to assist. Nothing was too difficult."}
{"text":"Vino is a wonderful place to have dinner. I would recommend trying the risotto. The staff is very friendly. The wine selection and atmosphere are very nice."}
{"text":"Have been to vibo many times with my parents, and every time it has been spectacular.  If you want great service, food and environment than you have come to the right place.   I went to Vibo recently for my mom's birthday and it's still amazing. Our waiters were amazing and funny. Good dynamic duo. One of the waiters was named Peter and the other I forget (bald gentleman who is very wity and hilarious).   We ordered some of the  specials to start the escargot and a salad. Both were delicious and would not change a thing about them.   Next was our mains. We all ordered specials which I ordered a blackened fish, my brother ordered another fish dish, my mother ordered a cream pasta with beef, and my dad ordered the veal chop.  The blackened fish was very light and was very tasty. Every bit of the dish worked. My mother's pasta was delicious, luckily she couldn't eat it all and my brother and I cleaned up the rest.   The overall experience was fantastic and made my mom enjoy her birthday that much more! Will be going here again and again!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood & have always wanted to try this place. So I popped by ladt night for dinner. The decor is a mix of old & new. They have a great selection of wine including a wine room when you first walk in. The good thing is they offer small bottles. The man playing the piano was a nice touch.   The complimentary bread didn't taste good. So I only had one piece. I love bread & only indulge in it when I go out for dinner. So I was disappointed. Plus I had to ask for balsamic vinegar. I mean isn't that standard in Italian restaurants?   I ordered the polenta fries which came with a gorgonzola sauce. They were ok. I first had them at Cibo Wine Bar & at Cibo they blew me away. Compared to Cibo's version this one paled in comparison.   I also ordered the bolognese with fresh fettucine. The fettucine was great but the sauce didn't cut it for me. I had to include a lot of salt to make it taste good. It was a good portion size.  The tiramisu was good. It came with berries which was weird but it was good.   The service was great.  IF I do go back, I'd go back to grab an appetizer & a glass of wine at the bar. You can get better Italian food in the city. Why settle? I feel for the price, the quality wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night on a weekend. Great food, great ambience and very courteous staff! Loved the overall atmosphere! My boyfriend ordered the yummy Rosemary roasted half chicken. I tried the homemade goatcheese and portobello agnolotti (for the first time) as suggested by our server and it was to die for! Loved it! For dessert, we ordered creme brûlée. They also have a great selection of wines. A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in Vibo.  It looks really nice from the outside and it's trying to be a fancy wine bar, but really is quite an average place.  Very pricey food and very slow service.  We were there on a Tuesday evening when it was very quiet and it took 45 minutes for our entrees (we didn't order appetizers).  The steak was great but the prawn and scallop dish was average and definitely didn't justify the price.  The wine list was very mediocre.  We wouldn't go there again but if money isn't a problem, then it's a nice enough place (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1)."}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  Beer selection is not good.  It's a fancier place, so don't dress slobby.  Also a bit pricier than other restaurants nearby, but very good quality.  Overall good value."}
{"text":"Great looking place, and great staff.  I was here for a private party, in a private room so my experience might be atypical.  All around good ambience in the main dining room.  The steak I ordered however could only be cooked one way, medium.  No option for rare, medium-rare, or well done.  Not sure why.    Derek"}
{"text":"Big delicious Italian Vibo serves up classy generous portions of Pasta, Risotto e Farinaci and Main courses. We were a party of five sitting beside the piano. Risotto balls, zoupa of the day, and bruschetta for appetizers and veal with lingunni as a main. Cresspella and deep fried risotto balls were 5 out of 5.  Main courses we equally splendid. Great old school service and accommodating staff. $80pp with alcohol and dessert. A full meal. Bloor west has a good deal of restaurants to choose from and Vibo is a great example."}
{"text":"Came here with my elderly grandfather & cousins for a nice meal but unfortunately our waiter was insanely creepy. He was a middle aged bald man who was mumbling constantly but for some reason thought it was funny. My poor grandfather couldn't hear a word he was saying. Im not sure if he was an actor who was trying to be funny...but it really rubbed all of us the wrong way. Just be normal dude. Also, we ordered some ice-cream/gelato at the end our meal and it took over 30 minutes to come. We were all a little pissed off by the time we left & I don't think we will return. The food was decent...3.5/5 but service a big 0/5. Also the decor is outdated- I think this may have been the place to go in 2005"}
{"text":"Back for seconds! Just as wonderful and I like consistency with food and wine and good service. One time could be by chance, twice- now we are talking science. You won't be disappointed. Buon  Appetito!"}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for Italian, Vibo comes to mind. My husband and I love coming here for dinner. Beautiful atmosphere, terrific food and meticulous and friendly service. We've never had a bad experience. My favourite dish is the veal piccata, it's so delicious. And if you still have room, order some dessert as they really are a treat. The crème brûlée is heaven."}
