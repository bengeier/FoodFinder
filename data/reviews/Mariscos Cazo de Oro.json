{"text":"The food was fantastic. Fish, mussels, clams, crab legs in a spicy soup covered in melt cheese with floury bread. Perfect. And the cervice with green sauce, avocado and cucumber was out of this world. It may not look great but the staff are friendly, the food excellent and the cost minimal. Thank you for the best Mexican food I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Went in because of reviews but should have know better as we could hear the \"music\" from outside. Seemed like a family affair as people swapped off on the microphone singing karaoke so loud out waitress had to put her mouth almost on my ear so I could hear her. Crazy loud. We left"}
{"text":"Delicious oysters especiales!!! The seafood is really good and it's never too crowded which is a plus. They have karaoke nights on Thursday for those interested. One of the best micheladas!!"}
{"text":"Horrible place. I won't call it a restaurant because is not. It's sort of a bar and something else. We ordered a victim and they brought me some sort of simmered salsa. My wife ordered shrimp and the host said they would be large shrimp but they brought us the Malaysian style mini shrimp. I have had mariscos in many places here in AZ and California but this place doesn't deserve to be called a mariscos and the locale stinks,  is old and extremely outdated."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here and will be back. Come try the campechana, etc, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is good, but looks like the place needs more maintenance and cleanliness, from outside you can see broken windows, patches on the walls, some broken and dusty furniture piled up, Inside was too dark for my preference. Another thing, make sure they understand what you ordered, not all the staff speaks english."}
{"text":"Mariscos fresquito y muy buen sabor además a buen precio la atención amable buen servicio buen ambiente familiar. Mi plato favorito es el 7 mares muy rico se los recomiendo para las personas que andan desveladas o simplemente tienen ganas de un buen caldo de marisco. Ahora que si lo que quiere es ahorrar eel jueves está a precio rebajado."}
{"text":"The music was great the seafood was fresh and the Micheladas were on point !  Perfect for the family or just to hang out with buddies .  I had the campechana especial and it was awesome ."}
{"text":"Didn't like the place way to expensive for campenganas and they can use a remodel won't recommend for a date"}
{"text":"Found this spot randomly driving down Main... I'm not an expert when it comes to Mexican seafood cuisine by any means, but we Googled the place and saw photos of some of the most enticing oysters I've seen in my days.... Went there the next day; was a bit odd as all the lights were out, but the owner came out and accommodated us. The oysters were sooooooo good. Pricey! But very good. The owner also talked to us about the spot and the differences between folk in Mesa as opposed to Phoenix and their attitudes on partying.... Then we watched the Larry David show on HBO on the tv while eating. It was pretty surreal... But the oysters were fantastic. They even let me take she shells home - and they even cleaned them for me! Honest people."}
{"text":"One of the best mariscos Restaraunts I've been to so far... Everything I tried was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Mariscos Cazo de Oro last week.  This is a place that could be easily overlooked.    We walk inside and find a rather casual place (not bad).  It kind of looks like a palapa or bar in the inside with a stage for a band and perhaps karaoke.  We were originally greeted in Spanish by the attendant.  Not a problem, as I know Spanish.  Eventually another person came by and took our order (thank goodness he spoke English).  We ordered the following:  1) Camarones de cucaracha.  This is a bit of a strange name, as literally the word cucaracha refers to cockroach.  That was not the case.  The camarones (shrimps) were grilled perfectly.  You could eat them head and all.  They were tasty.  2) Parrillada Mariscos Mixta (Mariscada).  Mixed grilled seafood.  It has some oysters, squid, crab, shrimp, and conch.  It was grilled with a bunch of peppers and onion.  It was good.  This is enough for two people.  Even that was a bit of a huge portion size for me.    Overall, the food was very good.  My wife, originally from Vietnam, had no problems with the seafood, and found it very fresh.    The only thing worth noting is that I do not drink alcohol.  As a result I did not drink and beer or anything.  Perhaps what we ate would have gone well with beer, but I do not drink alcohol.    My wife and I had a good experience here.  It is a small, casual, place.  We will definitely come back here.  We just hope that this place gets more business, and is able to stay open.  We want this restaurant to be profitable and stay open.  They need more business.    If you are a little adventurous, and ready to try something dramatically different.  Go to this place.  I bet that what you experience will be very similar to some kiosk or walkup in Rocky Point (Puerto Penasco) when it comes to seafood."}
{"text":"We were driving by, trying to find some place to eat. Saw it and decided to go in. Being from the coast, good seafood is hard to come by but this place definitely did great. Plus great, friendly service."}
{"text":"Service was nice, the food was decent but its way to expensive for what you get. Ive had better campechanas with more flavor for less $$$. I tried this place only because it had 5 stars and I left disappointed."}
