{"text":"I went there for a Salsa Night. There was a class first and then social dance. After dancing for a few hours I went to sit on the side until the waitress came and told me to leave, as they reserve the seats just for people that are drinking. I think that after paying $18 I should have the right to sit when I am tired. I am disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to Lula's for my wife's birthday. Good was great and we had a great time with the salsa lesson. Only negative was we thought that the live music would have started sooner. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Went here last night (on a Friday) and felt like I was transported into a Cuban resort. The live salsa band was amazing. You couldn't help but want to dance, actually there were very few people who remained seated. There was no pretension, everybody was there to have a good time. I found the cover ($15) to be a little expensive given the venue but the live music made up for that. I would definitely go back and start with their salsa lesson before the \"nightclub\" portion of the evening begins."}
{"text":"We went for brunch. Food was ok. It was a different experience and the live music makes it different. We also went with kids and it was a good atmosphere for them. It won't be one of my go to brunch spots, but it's worth a try if you want to do something different for brunch for a change."}
{"text":"We went to Lula Lounge for the salsa dance lesson and live music this past weekend. The instructors were great (considering my partner and I have very little rhythm and two left feet), and the live band was fantastic. Even amongst all sorts of seasoned salsa dancers, we didn't feel out of place. I can't comment on the food, as we specifically didn't go there for dinner based on my impressions of the menu (I wasn't impressed). 

My only criticism is that the drink prices were high and the quality was not too great. (e.g. only one beer on tap, approximately $7 for a pint.) My partner and I each had a mojito ($11 each) and for that price, we had hoped it would be really good. Unfortunately, they were not. Maybe I'm old school, but when your cover is $15, I kinda expect that the drink prices would not be too expensive. 

So in short, we'd probably go again for the dancing and music, but would drink elsewhere before arriving."}
{"text":"Live Band and DJ.  Place was hopping last night (Friday night).  If you want Salsa dancing, this is the place for it."}
{"text":"Amazing band feels like Cuba. Just love it.  We didn't eat here we came for the band. The reason I gave it a 3 is because it was not busy. I was disappointed. If this place was crowded, it would have been amazing"}
{"text":"Went to see a dance event and as if our seats weren't bad enough, the waiter kept walking in front of us, over and over. I understand that the bar was next to us, but there were other ways to get there without blocking our view every few minutes, and a few times he was just walking around looking lost. 

Finally came time to get our cheques. Wasn't impressed to see they had included the tip price on the receipt. and to follow that up when I paid in change/cash for my few drinks the waiter comes back and tells me I'm $0.75 short.I told him no I'm not it's a tip plus, I paid almost $0.10 extra. counted it a few times before ever giving him the money. He stood at the table and didn't leave, he looked confused, and was expecting me to pull 75 cents out of thin air. Someone at my table gave him 75 cents and he left. 

He then took forever with getting change for just 1 person at our table. Waiter just disappeared into the back again just like he did earlier in the night when he asked for ID and didn't seem like he knew how to determine if it was good or not, and fled with it to the back, and came back a bit later. 

Do not recommend this place based on this night alone. 
Had no interaction with any other server, although the manager kept standing in peoples way while admiring the show and watching his employees.

{"text":"There really is no other place like this in Toronto. Lula stands as a shining example of Toronto's diverse cultural make up, providing a home for music lovers, musicians, dancers, food enthusiasts, and anyone looking for a lovely night on the town. 

My personal highlights are: dancing to the Lula All-Stars, the black bean burrito (so good!) and table #24 (if you like a good view of the stage, this is the table to get)."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place is a joke they are money hungry , the only good thing was the live band after that it went down the hill. They are over price for nothing .the music was terrible ,the trio dip with home made plantain was so bad, they also charge you for sitting on real.I will never go back there. People don't waste your time going there"}
{"text":"oh ya, 5 stars.  for the food!

also, pleasant service.  warm atmosphere for all its nooks and lofts. 

but the food!  bit pricey, but not as pricey as when you go specifically for a quality and creative food experience.  that's how i would describe this menu.  good portions too.  the flavour combinations were such a surprise, not just for a place that seems to be much more about the acts.

i was told the chef's name is Trevor Viirre, that the menu is his creation.  our whole table raved about the meal.  ...except for the quiet one... oh and the cynical one, but i could tell they loved it too! 

this guy trevor is a super star.  very talented.  what a treat."}
{"text":"For entertainment and salsa dancing, Lula lounge is great. Dinner however was fairly disappointing. We went in there with hopes that the food was great (based on others' recommendations. 

The service was friendly and accomodating even though they didn't seem to have many details of our reservation (large group).

Food was fairly mediocre. The watermelon salad seemed to have too many random ingredients that didn't work well together. The Tofu chana masala with basmati rice was way too peppery and did not taste like it had any indian spices. It just seemed that a ton of black pepper was used to make it spicy.  

Overall a very fun night at Lula like always but I would definitely skip the food."}

{"text":"Lula Lounge Cuban Brunch is held on Sundays and was picked as a venue for a friend's birthday party. What a great idea! For $15 you get an excellent AYCE brunch along with salsa dancing lessons. First you can eat from a centrally located buffet that had a traditional breakfast selection along with healthful choices so you could pick and choose some of each. All of it was top notch and fresh. Desserts were good too and we indulged in Mimosas to go along with the party theme.
The best part was the dance lesson and the music along with the charismatic dance instructor who was fabulously engaging, animated and hilarious. His moves were great!
Of course he made it look easy but there was no problem dancing goofy as everyone was staring at the instructor.
The music was excellent, although you had to zone out the drum machine to enjoy the singing, guitar and flute playing. Oh ya! The guy on flute was great and that instrument was perfect for the music. There were several parties going on, some all-ages, at the same time in the spacious and cavernous place making a fun atmosphere with a kids baptism after party, etc. Good fun!"}

Great place for beginner salsa dancers to go and take someone for a spin! Not sure if they have the $55 special still! 3
Course meal with salsa lesson and live band on Saturday nights only! It's so old school the decor and I love the mismatched tables and chairs... so fun! The food is excellent! But you must book in advance your reservation! This place is busy! If your a light eater I'd suggest having dinner early! 
In businessand the servers happy!
They are all so sweet! Thank you!

{"text":"I went on Sunday morning for brunch and salsa. The salsa lesson was fun and the live band excellent. However, i would not do it twice as they only cover very basic steps and it get a bit repetitive after a while.

Service was fast, friendly and very attentive.

 The food is not impressive (you can get much better brunches in Toronto for much less). Also, I ordered two lattes: the first one was delicious and the second was too strong. So, i am guessing consistence is not their forte."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our night dancing salsa accompanied by an  awesome live band! Cover charge is $15/per person on 'event' nights. A sit down dinner will get you a table for the whole night. They offer a free dance lesson at 9 pm led by professional instructors who were amazing. It gets really busy on the dance floor and the party goes on quite late. I'm giving it four stars only because they let the place get a little too packed."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch and dance event here is excellent!

For just $18 you get to enjoy an all you can eat brunch buffet and a salsa dance lesson.

The buffet isn't standard brunch food (omelettes, sandwiches, etc) there are lots of great options to choose from! Todays selection included an egg bake, curry chicken, rice & beans, and salad. They also served the most amazing hashbrowns. 

After brunch you get to enjoy a salsa lesson accompanied by a live band, loads of fun!

Especially great for birthday parties."}
{"text":"Went to enjoy a friends b-day celebration- and lula lounge was the plan.

3 course meal and salsa lessons.  Around $50 a person. Why not right??

So we get there and the menu was pre-fixed. So you have to order the 3 course regardless of how hungry you are. It was a lot for me to handle. I was somewhat full to begin with and when the appetizers came. We all surfed and turfed off of each other's plates - I got even fuller.

Then the fun part - the salsa lessons. Men on one side and women on the other. It was a crash course in salsa that I failed miserably. The only salsa I have had experience with was the one with tortilla chips. It was fun-it was getting exciting until I got a tap on my shoulder- It was my waiter telling me that the food is ready. Right in the middle of the lesson. Now to those who know steaks- its only so long you can have it sitting around before it turns into chewy rubber. So that was it for dancing.

I ordered the burrito as well- which was really good. I enjoyed it a lot. I tried out all the other items and the fish and the burrito were probable the best choices. I was thinking about rejoining the dance floor but at this point the salsa lessons were already too advanced and I myself had become a burrito-stuffed. So we became spectators.

After the salsa lesson- was an awesome live performance. Very talented musicians and it was certainly a treat to experience that. Felt almost vacation like. 

Our dessert came- and at this point it was too much. I ate and could barely move. I knew it was time to head out of this place and promptly asked for the bill. That's when I was stunned. Tip is automatically included in your bill - $150 for 2 people . In all fairness I can understand the prices as they have to pay for bouncers - salsa instructors- restaurant staff - live musicians. So the premium is understandable. Good thing i wasn't drinking.

Might go back for the dance floor only $15 cover. The dinner and lesson thing- maybe not. However- it was a new experience and definitely not a regret!"}
{"text":"I haven't been back here in years, this was my first time in at least 4 years and it hasn't changed one bit.  Of the few Salsa clubs in Toronto, this is one of the only ones that play live music. Every weekend is a different band - its a nice change from the standard DJ songs which end up being meringue the entire time. 

People who come here aren't as inclined to dance salsa as other clubs like Babaluu (where everyone knows how to dance, and are there to do some salsa). There were only a few who knew what they were doing, and some in the middle of the floor just getting in the way. 

Lots of stagettes here tonight, and it's beyond me why you choose a salsa club as a venue for an event when you have no inclination of dancing. Most people were still up in theri seats just watching.

The music started around 10:45pm after the lesson, but only lasted about an hour when they switched it to some DJ music. It was okay when it was salsa, but just awful when it turned into a mix of soca and reggage. 

I really like the live band, but as an experienced dancer would prefer Babaluus even if it's cramped and small. The $15 cover doesn't help the cause either. If you eat there, there's no cover, but food seemed to take a long time to come out. 

If you're looking for just fun times, it seemed like the crowd was enjoying themselves, so this review is very subjective."}
{"text":"A friend, who is part of a performative salsa dance group, was performing on a Friday evening, so we came out to support her. The dances (which was a mix of professionals and amateurs) started at 9pm. We arrived at 9pm. Apparently, everyone is free before 8pm (they open at 6:30), however, only ladies are free before 10pm. On Fridays, they generally have a jazz band playing. The band played after the performances were done that evening. In order to sit at a table, you must be ordering food. Initially, our big group of 7 (plus 1 for our friend) was given a table in the corner where the servers kept going to. This table sat 2. You also could see nothing from it. So instead we stood up... which made things even more uncomfortable as it was quite obvious that the servers were not happy that we were in their way. There really wasn't anywhere else for us to go either. Later, we were given a booth, and we ordered more drinks and some food. Honestly, I would not go here to eat. I would only come here to dance. The food was in small portions, and pricey. It tasted good, but nothing extraordinary. 
The music was decent, and it was quite interesting to see people who are clearly regulars or who are proficient dancers on the floor. I'm definitely a clumsy dancer but the spirit of the dance floor was quite infectious!

The only thing I found annoying was when the bill came, there was already a tip included. Which is quite obviously written there, but drunk people could easily ignore it. The staff do not mention that it's there, and the debit/credit terminal still asks you to tip. VERY SNEAKY!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife while on vacation, and have to break it down to be fair:

Service/Entertainment:  This is where they shine.  Our waitress was fantastic, the music was incredible, and the Salsa instructor did an amazing job teaching such a large group (I taught at Fred Astaire studios for a while and understand how tricky it is to work a crowd that size).  Top notch in that regard. 

The food: Oh Lord.  It was bad.  Not just \"meh, could have been better,\" but BAD.  Not only was it just barely warm, but it made me violently ill that night.  By 3am, I was vomiting and worse in our hotel room.  

For dancing and drinking, Lula lounge is great.  But get your dinner elsewhere beforehand.  I wouldn't take my chances there again."}
{"text":"NEVER book a booth here!!

I came here for a friend's birthday. We booked a booth for this occasion. While I enjoyed their company the whole booth experience was absolutely unsatisfactory.

The booth was uncomfortable and too tiny for us. Menu had a $50 mix and match 3-course meal and you have to order the whole thing. Food quality was mediocre at best (see attached pics) and surely not worth the money. Steak was dry and tasted like it was microwaved. Chicken wings tasted like KFC but without the herbs and spices. To make matters worse they made us pay cover charge for 2 people who did not show up even though the booth was barely fitting us and if those 2 people showed up they would have had no place to sit!

I absolutely do not recommend that you book a booth at this lounge. Just drink and dance."}
{"text":"A really fun place for a date night and even with a few friends!
It's not new and modern but it's cozY and familiar. 
It gets very busy and jam packed on the dance floor! Nice fun live band! But can only
Hear the same 'beat' for 'so long'  never had a bad time! 
It could use some updating, and more regular up keeping, especially with the fee they charge just for entering 
But the band and tequila makes sure you have a great time!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party on a  Friday night. Mandatory $50 prix-fixe meal (plus tip auto added) or $20 cover for just the show with no access to seating/booth. 

Went in well before the show started, around 8 pm. Mojitos were very decent. All the aperitifs seemed good. 

However the appetizers were another story. Most opted for the shrimp cocktail, which was little more than 5 shrimps with a mango dipping sauce. Very forgettable. The chimichurri beef was a bit dry and flavourless from what I heard. I had the patatas bravas, which to my surprise bares little resemblance to the original dish as it was just regular french fries with paprika, drizzled with spicy aioli and way too oversalted. 

The entrés were not much better, the steak was large but seemed overcooked and dry even though medium-rare was requested. The catfish plate was good for everything but the catfish, I wish they'd have chosen a higher quality fish, way too fishy/muddy taste for that pairing.

Overall the food is not BAD, but definitely overpriced for the quality you get. I would have been willing to look the other way if it wasn't for the (non-existent) service. Even though there were just our table and a few booths occupied early on, it took FOREVER for the server to come around to ask for drinks and whenever she finally did she seemed to have an unspoken attitude and complete lack of interest. And they kept mixing up who ordered what even though they wrote everyone's name down. Even the guy that poured water had an attitude and everyone's cups were always empty for periods of about half hour. Not one good thing to say about the service.

The rest you know from the other reviews - the salsa lessons, live band, dancing. That was good and fun. I would never come here for the food again, only for the entertainment."}
{"text":"Back in the day, there was a crazy club up north at Keele and 7 called 'Latin Fever,' which was the place AKA the 'wall of middle aged guys' who had possessed a few choice salsa moves that were an excuse to be gropey. Of course while this predated the #metoo movement I observed some of this at Lula Lounge during the crazy awesome mix of live and DJ bands on the dance floor. 

We came yesterday for a friend's milestone birthday. The large group we were a part of had options as part of the price fixe menu, including appy, main and dessert with drinks extra. Including admission the cost was between $40 and $50 each plus an extra 18% mandatory tip added to the bill. 

I opted for the dip trio app and salmon. The trio was shareable and had a chance to split it with the calamari rings by my wife. The rings were standard frozen fare, the dips we're good but the chips were cardboard in texture the salmon was a bit dried out (maybe also frozen?) With a side of couscous and veg. The steak ordered for an extra $10.00 was supposed to be medium well, but it seemed to be a strip of leather belt and very chewy. 

For dessert, the Tres Leche was on the sweet side and could not be finished. My wife ordered the chocolate cappuccino cake which seemed to be the better option. The beer and wine options were plentiful, and reasonably priced. 

What stood out was the service. We had the private room to ourselves.the staff were caring, fun and attentive. They have the birthday boy a free drink and a CD (they still make those?) and were full of energy andadr for a great evening. 

Afterward the awesome Jazz band, there was a dance lesson and then a mix of live salsa and DJ which caused the dance floor to erupt. 

So, for $150.00 for drinks, food and tip for 2, a pretty good time that you should experience at least once. A good alternative to the now defunct Latin Fever! -Zuk"}
{"text":"Went there last night on Friday Aug 24 and the night started off badly. They tried charging me for the female guest that I was with. I told them website clearly said the cover was waived for women before 11pm and they denied it ! Only when I offered to pay her cover did they relent  admit a few other people had mentioned that too. Either they are very disorganised or scammers but it left a bad taste in my mouth. We did not have the food which I remember as being average and washrooms were gross. 

Lot's of women by midnight when it gets busy if your a single male but knowing how to salsa can be a asset in a place like this. Doesn't appear to be a big drinking crowd and it seems like the place gets a lot of regulars.
FYI - I checked their website after I got home to confirm about the no cover charge for ladies even though the information for that date is now gone as they do up date their website quickly."}
{"text":"Was here during the summer on a Friday night. Very packed. Age group was 25+ . It's hard to dance salsa, but live music was amazing . Felt like I was in Latin America. Not a lot of tables and servers/bartender are always busy . A great place to bring a date and slow dance bachata maybe. Not a great place to spin your partner ."}
{"text":"Last minute decision to listen to Ron Davis and the Hogtown Brass and first time at Lula.
$35 for a fix prix 3 course meal- which was really good.  Service was great and music fantastic. Found easy street parking.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been here 2x now in the span of over 3 years and the place remains consistent.  It's a salsa club. Expect a LOT of Latinos. Some of them, cannot dance. They are single and either come alone or in packs. The last time I went, one of my girl friends was asked to dance by this Latino who had a very unique rhythm in his feet. He really was not following the beats - he was shuffling much faster and to his tune. My friend, who is taking salsa dance lessons, was suffering in silence!  Another Latino asked my other friend and he was a much better dancer and gentlemanly too. It was delightful to watch them dance together.

But the better enjoyment comes from watching the couples take over the dance floor. There are some incredible salsa dancers out there! Some of them are teachers/students and others are Latinos from Latin America who have been dancing all their lives!  It is a great pleasure to admire them as their bodies rhythmically move to the beats.

I go occasionally because I know people like to salsa dance. Not many people like to dance to alternative music ~le sigh~.  You may or may not know this, but if you are dancing with a buffoon, you can gently tap him on the shoulder and thank him and call it quits. Frankly, I decline dancing with the men there and much prefer to dance with my girlfriends. I came there to have fun with them!

Ladies free on Fridays before 10pm. Cover charge on Sats. Live band playing and that's always a riot!"}
{"text":"I went to Lula Lounge with a group of friends to watch a friend perform in a tribute show to Marvin Gaye and Luther Vandross. It was our first time here, far away from home.

The venue was very nice and spacious, with a high ceiling and a large dance floor in the middle, although there were tables and chairs on it this evening. There was raised seating/dining along either side of the dance floor and a large bar closer to the entrance. It definitely had a lounge feel to it.

Our server was very friendly and attentive, assisting us with choosing a wine and some apps. We ended up with a couple of bottles of wine, chicken wings, calamari, and a trio of dips with tortilla chips. The menu definitely had Latin influences.

The food was okay but nothing stood out. The chicken wings were tossed in a Cajun dry rub and served with sour cream on the side. The calamari was lightly dusted and fried, with house-made tartar sauce on the side. Bland. The dips, consisting of guacamole, salsa, and refried beans, was okay but the chips were too wide to fit into the portion cups for dipping. We finished the chips but not the dips. Based on these dishes, I'm not sure if I would order dinner here.

The show that we came to see was fantastic, with some outstanding performances, and the audience, like us, was really into it! Great job, Quisha and friends! There was a burlesque show scheduled afterwards that we could have stayed for without an additional cover charge but we would have had to move to another table. We'll be back for more shows. Maybe we'll eat before..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great music, and good food. Live band preforming salsa music and dancefloor open for salsa dancing"}
{"text":"Went for the weekend salsa and set dinner menu option for a party. Lula lounge seems to cater to parties, there were at least 2 other bachelorettes while we were there. Huge portions of food that were good, but not all that memorable. Dessert however was spectacular, both the tres leche and the chocolate espresso cake were so good we couldn't decide between dancing or eating dessert even though we were stuffed. They also give you the option to order two appetizers in place of a side, which is nice if you want to share more of your food with a group."}
{"text":"Came here for The Lulaworld Festival and was thoroughly impressed. 

As a clueless white boy, I have little to no dancing skills. After a couple of drinks and a salsa lesson that roped in most of the dinner crowd, we were dancing the night away.

The food and music was all authentic and amazing. It's like going to Cuba except the foods better and there are running toilets.

All in all, a night to remember."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Lula but tonight when my girlfriend and I came to watch one of our favorite bands play our experience was a disappointment. They had a dog inside the establishment that got better service than we did."}
{"text":"$15 cover? Pretty ludicrous. I went on a Friday night, but got there later than I had originally planned (around 10:30 pm.) There was a fantastic live salsa band playing, but not many people on the dance floor. It was an older crowd, and a lot of sketchy men were also present.  If you're under 25 years old, this is definitely not the place to be. I love salsa dancing, but this placed really lacked the vibe. The drinks are also overpriced, and the bartender was unfriendly. Not coming back."}
{"text":"It's hard to peg this place on one side or another, on one hand they have amazing entertainment in the venue sourcing great talent from all over; then there's the food, tame uninspiring, tiny and insanely overpriced. $20 for a small burrito, and small entrees around the $18-$35 range, $10 for 4 chicken wings, $8 for cake the size of a dessert square and $14 for a small bowl of soup. 

They used to do mandatory tipping here and I'm glad they scrapped it, the waitress told my friends off when they asked about dinner and whats available during the performance, they ate somewhere else  for less than half the price and came back for the show.

2 Stars for great entertainment and accessible venue"}
{"text":"Been here twice for bachelorette parties. Overall, I probably wouldn´t recommend for a bachelorette. Not wild enough.

The food is really mediocre. It´s not terrible but it´s not good restaurant quality, they present well but there´s nothing special about it. Drinks were better.

The free salsa dance lesson on the Friday nights is really fun, especially if you´re a beginner. After that, the floor opens up and lots of middle aged couples hit the dance floor. It´s not packed. 

Really cool venue and decor but food and ambiance is lacking."}
{"text":"I read reviews that the food wasn't good, but I and my 3 guests enjoyed it. I had the chimichurri beef appetizer. Not the best cut of beef, but it was delicious and was served on a plate with a delicious salad. My entré was  the pork chop. It was a big portion, well seasoned, delicious.  My friend got the sole, which I tried, and it was  nicely cooked. Dessert was gross.  I had the fruit, which was  not sweet, served with a weird cinamon yogurt-style dip. My friends had the flourless chocolate cake, which I thought tasted gross, but at least one of my friends liked it.  Dance lesson was good by kind of hard for everyone to see the instructor. Might have been better if the instructor stood in the middle of the crowd instead of at the front. The band is an authentic salsa band. Very good. DJ was good but I would have liked  if he played more of a mix to break up the hours long salsa sets.  It was mostly large groups at dinner, all of whom oddly left well before midnight (in other words, weren't there to dance).  I'm single, and didn't find this to be a good place for singles. Most people are paired up. There were two groups of all ladies, both left fairly early. ....certainly before I was drunk. Imported beer was $5.95. Three course dinner was $54 on a Sat night. Well worth it for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Came here as part of the salsa dancing package with the course meal for $49. You get a prefixed menu with multiple choices but to be honest, the choices weren't that great. For that amount of money I expect a little bit better food. The best part was the dessert lol. The place is dark with dark red lighting.

The salsa lessons began at 9:30 and basically a bunch of people circled around the dance floor while we followed one instructor. He taught us some basic steps but it was pretty hard Imo! It was an ok experience, it wasn't really in depth and there were so many people vs one instructor. Because of the amount of people it was hard to dance because of the limited space. The lesson lasted for an hour? And then they started playing live music and the dance floor was free for everyone. There are a lot of experienced people there and it was hard to test out your new beginner moves right after the lesson ended! The crowd is an older crowd, I'd say 40+ with some exceptions. 

I don't think it was really worth the money for this package, quite pricey and came to 63$ with 17% mandatory tips. You can come here for $15 cover and just skip the mediocre food."}
{"text":"About 3 years ago I gave Lula Lounge a petty 1 star because it truly deserved it after the service we received, getting food poisoning - among other things. I never thought that I would step foot back in this place. Actually, I may have muttered those words multiple times, however, I somehow was convinced to attend my friend's birthday party this year at Lula.

I'm glad that I gave this place a second chance because it was LOVELY. It seemed that the staff was more knowledgeable and friendlier this time around. Our server (I wish I remembered his name) was just on top of his game. Everything from meal recommendations to drink suggestions and just being overly lively. It really boosted the mood. . I had the Spinach Salad, Fried Calamari and Dip Trio. I love how we were able to opt for 1 app, 1 entree and 1 dessert OR 3 apps and 1 dessert. It made it great for sharing and wanting to get your hands and sample the menu. The food was delicious.

While we had dinner, a live Jazz band played in the background- they were great. Really added some energy for the dinner portion. Shortly after, the salsa lessons began. This is where I find things turn into a bit of a mess. Too many people in my opinion to follow 1 little woman at the front. Although she was vocal, energetic and obviously talented, perhaps having her up on a screen, an additional person or splitting the crowd in half would be more ideal. I have no idea how people in the back were able to see her. I didn't even bother joining and just sat as a bystander.

After the salsa lessons (which I'm sure lasted maybe 30 + minutes - didn't really time the event) there were live dance performances by a dance group. I rather enjoyed that. It was a nice piece of entertainment to get the night going.

Then towards the end of the night they had (no word of a life, a 12 piece or more) live band. They were AMAZING, phenomenal!!!. I would come back alone and pay cover just to listen to them. They had great energy, I actually felt as though I was on vacation and listening to a live band from the city. 

The band played for about 45minutes (or more) again I had no sense of time but the night ended off with a DJ playing a great selection of music. Everything from reggaeton, to dancehall to kuduro and a mix of top 40. 

I will certainly give Lula another shot in the future. Either for dinner and the whole shazam OR just for the live band and dancing portion. What turns me off about places like this are the dramatic change from one night to the next. Although my experiences were years apart, it can still have some us feeling iffy and reliving the first horrible experience. I'm glad that Lula though made changes and overall improved their staff and food."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Lula Lounge yesterday for a Halloween Party that my dance school was hosting there. I have been to Lula many times before when my school has hosted other events and I must say I LOVE it here... The music is great, the live band is awesome and the salsa lesson is a nice added touch to the beginning of the evening.

Last night I didn't go early for dinner, but this place is also a restaurant. Most people arrive around 6 to 7 eat then dance the night away.  I have eaten here once and the food was off the wall when it comes to flavour and portions.. Because I am not a picky eater I didn't find it hard to decide on a meal but I do remember people at our table were having a little bit of a problem.

During the summer months it can get really packed which is the only downfall when choosing to go to lula. I feel they over pack the place and it's hard to dance but then again Salsa Club dancing is much different than Salsa Dancing :)"}
{"text":"The cuban band is amazing, the vibe is nice, if you go there just to dance I guess it's fine, but the food and drinks are meh and expensive."}
{"text":"This was definitely a HOOT!  We went for the Sunday SALSA brunch.  
This is the deal... you head in for 11, and the meal is 15 dollars flat.  
It looks like a nice south amercican place... bright colours... big sunken dance floor.  
they serve spicy rice, a spicy chicken with beans,... pasta, sausages, potatoes, eggs..... your basic breakfast stuff.  
Agree with the review below... drinks are a little expensive.  
So, you do the eating thing.... then the instructor calls everyone out on the dance floor.  EVERYONE is there.. there were families, kids, old and young folks, and we go through some basic Salsa lessons.  This instructor was fantastic... he was so funny, and I think I really improved my Salsa moves.  Well, that's what my girlfriend said anyways.  I found this less intense and I had less anxiety about this then when doing actual dance lessons.  
A live band comes on and we continue the Salsa lessons.  We went back for some water and sagria refills... and we stayed for about 3 hours in total.  
For the breakfast for both of us, 2 mojitos, and 1L of Sangria, with tip included, cost us 80 bucks (40 each).  
So... food was meh... drinks were meh... instructor and vibe was delightful.  I'd go back.  Yay!"}
