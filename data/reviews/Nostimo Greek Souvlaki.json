{"text":"What can I say? 
Very basic Greek food, I can't say it's bad but I can't say it's amazing.
The service is always friendly which is always a major plus. 
There's no variety and by that I mean no apps,no desert, just salad,meat,potatoes and rice. So if you're looking for something new and exciting this is not the place for you.
On the other hand if you want your basic Greek it's not a bad place.

Definitely worth a try though :)"}
{"text":"This place is actually great and the portions are large and the price is decent.  Only downside is it's tough to catch them when they are open. The hours are kind of strange."}
