{"text":"Paid $9 per beer for average craft beers and to sit in the A/C on a hot day. Felt a little violated when we left. I guess I forgot what hotel prices are like."}
{"text":"It's no secret, I'm not a fan of the Edgewater property as a whole and you can now add Augie's to this list.  At times, they have been severely short staffed, having to wait almost 15 minutes to put in a drink order.  From a value perspective, it also misses the mark.  While the burger served on a brioche bun was good, it doesn't justify the $16 price point.  With their other establishments on site, I think they take advantage of their captive hotel guests and just don't try. that hard  And the frustrating piece is that they have a beautiful property with so much potential that is simply squandered.  Sad."}
{"text":"A great bar right inside the edge water hotel! I had the frost on mendota cocktail which was very good, cheese curds for an appetizer that came with a tasty dipping sauce and the steak salad. Their \"bar\" menu wasn't your typical burgers and sandwiches type of menu, it has great options such as the steak salad and the PBLT which was a pork belly BLT (also tasty). Definitely recommend coming here if you're staying at the edge water or not!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with some groovy mood music. The bar tender was very nice and we were able to keep an eye on our rental Hyundai and the lake from the bar.  p.s.It's $7 plus tax for their best beer."}
