{"text":"A group of us traveled to Gallucci on a winery bus tour of the Toronto area. They weren't ready for us when we arrived, so we had to stand outside in the burning sun for almost 30 minutes.Then, the winery tour involved looking at their storage room, some kind of shed that they \"might turn into a gelato stand,\" and their walk-in refrigerator.  When we finally got to taste the wine, they poured the teeniest, tiniest little sips. I've never been to a wine tasting that was so chintzy. When one of my friends asked if she could have a slightly larger pour, the employee rolled her eyes and dripped a couple more drops into her glass. We weren't there to get loaded, but when you go to a wine tasting, you want to actually taste the wine. How do they expect to sell any bottles of wine when they won't let you take more than a little sip?  Even though they sell fine cheeses in their shop, the free cheese pairings they offered were literally just blocks of supermarket cheese. One of my friends got scolded for trying to taste a piece before they poured the wine.  It's a shame because the wines we tried were actually pretty good. But the experience was frustrating, to say the least."}
{"text":"Went on the weekend for a tour and wine and cheese tasting.  The tour was mediocre - have had better.  The information given was minimal, and the lady doing the tour couldn't answer the question as to when the grapes were picked for ice wine.  Since they are pushing their ice wine, this should be known.  We were however given a lot of information about the owners' families and what other businesses they are into or planning on doing.  For the wine tasting the group was placed on a table on the front porch.  It was cold as it was later in the evening and facing east, so no sun.  The amount of wine given per tasting was minimal - it was suppose to be 1 oz per glass, however, it got less as the serving went along.  You could barely taste the wine before it was finished.  It would also have been nice for someone to actually be present when we are tasting to explain the wine or answer questions.  Instead, we got a quick spiel before the wine was poured, and then the server disappeared until the next wine was to be served.  With the 4 wines tasted, it probably equaled to less than a glass of wine.  The cheese quality was basic.  Really just small pieces of cheese, some seemed to have been cut and sitting for awhile, as the outside was dry.  Other tastings I have been to, gives 1/2 glass per tasting and give crackers or bread along with the cheese.  The wine tasted were also just OK.  Nothing stood out as being excellent.  The property was beautiful however.  They have some beautiful huge ducks on the home's property.  It would be a beautiful setting for a wedding, minus the drawback of Ninth Line being adjacent to the gazebo.  This is a young winery, only 2 years in production, so some more time probably needs to be under their belts."}
{"text":"I WILL NOT TRAVEL TO GALLUCCI WINERY OR RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE, IF THERE WERE A SPOT TO CLICK FOR ZERO STARS OR NEGATIVE STARS THIS WINERY WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS THAT!!  .....I travelled all the way to this winery with a friend after making reservations on the internet for a wine tour. There were slots on the website to choose the date and time of your preferred tour.  We have not been to this neck of the woods before and so we were one hour early for our 2pm scheduled tour. We then decided to drive around the neighbourhood and grab a snack then headed back.   As we walked in to this empty winery that had opened in 2014, we had to wait awhile for someone to show up at the reception area, then finally, we check-in. To our surprise, the one staff said there was no tour for us because it was full, when we questioned how it could be full when we were the only ones in the building? He then changed his mind and told us the truth that due to lack of public interest there was only two of us therefore no tour and that we were notified by emailed already. (We had not receive any emails). Our blackberries were glue to our hips, we would know!...now because he had already lied about a full tour, there was no reason to believe they even bothered to notify us. At this point he said we can come back at 4pm and they will tour us.   There was no apology, no offer of samples to try their product so that even without the tour, I may still purchase their wines but instead he went off to serve some couple that was eating in the patio, I guess they were paying customers and we were only potential customers. What a waste of our time!!  We ended up driving to another winery nearby that had good reviews called Willow Springs Winery. Their staff greeted us as we walked through their doors, very knowledgeable and had free samples on ice wine and wine. I ended up spending over $300 there. Tough luck to this Gallucci Winery who didn't care for our business."}
{"text":"Until one of my co-workers mentioned there are wineries in Stouffville, I was completely unaware.  This is a great little spot to check out - the owner is friendly, the wines of course are ones you can't get in the LCBO.  The tasting fee is waived when you buy a bottle which is nice.  You'll definitely get something a little different here - perfect for a gift or just for yourself.  There is plenty of parking in front and the grounds/views are so nice.    We just went for the tastings and didn't order any food so I can't comment on that - but i'm definitely curious to try their menu next summer.  They have seating outside so you can have your meal overlooking the vineyards.  Nice way to spend lunch :)"}
{"text":"Relatively new winery just north of Toronto.  The wines are pretty good (especially the Don Paulo, highly recommended!) but the tasting area is quite small although it has never been crowded when we were there.  If Antonio is there, you're in luck...he is a fount of knowledge regarding the wines.  I'm not comfortable saying the the other staff are not knowledgeable but certainly there is a significant gap between Antonio and the regular staff.  They have a small patio in the back but we have not tried their food.  The wines are priced reasonably.  Overall, quite an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"This is my first YELP review and even before going to this place, owner seemed nice until I told him that I was going to use a Travelzoo voucher at it's face value (not promotional value) and he said he would not honour it.  I made it clear that I wasn't expecting the promotional value, just the money I had already paid and he refused.  Travelzoo's promotion does state that merchants must by law accept it at face value.  Too bad, looked like a nice winery and my girlfriend and I both love wine and would've purchased a couple bottles at least."}
{"text":"This winery goes above and beyond my expectations.  The owner is very personable and fun loving you can tell he really enjoys his passion  If you are in the region this is a must see it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The food was spectacular"}
{"text":"We had a very large group tour the winery. The tour guide did a good job showing us around. Most of the tour consisted of random facts about the owner, but it did also go over the production and distribution of the product. If you want to see a large scale winery with large vats and loads of barrels, this is not the place to go. Instead, this is more like a microwinery. Currently they are producing around 10K bottles/year, so its really quite small. There are plans for expansion though so you may see Gallucci stocked at lcbo in the near future!  The property is very nice and only opened to the public a couple years ago. The store space is beautiful and modern. There is also a bistro on the property that serves food made with ingredients grown in their own green house. I will definitely need to return for that!!  As stressed during the tour, the grapes are still very young. This means that they have not unleashed their full potential yet. I believe the first vines were planted less than 10 years ago. I can't comment too much on the wines as I dont remember it too well but I can say that they were not bad at all...its not that I was drunk, its just that I have delayed writing this review. My favourite from the tasting, however, was the baco noir. All in all, we tasted two whites, two reds and an ice wine. Along with each wine, a fellow walked around and served us a cheese he recommended for pairing. I am convinced however that the cheese was from the local walmart.   Considering the fact that we were the largest group they have ever served, I was very happy. They did run out of wine a couple times when pouring though and this once resulted in some members of the group tasting a substition ice wine. Additionally, the pours were inconsistent. Some people kept getting large pours while others barely had a two sips. At ~$20pp (26 people) I would have expected them to bring out enough wine for all of us!   In the store, bottles are fairly priced in the range of $15-20 and ice wines are around $50 as usual. I was pleasantly surpised about the prices because I was expecting a premium due to the size of the winery.   3 stars because it was GOOD WINE, the employees are kind and this was a first for them in terms of size. Missing a couple stars because pours were tiny and cheese was not really that amazing. I will update this review in the near future when I get a chance to taste the food!"}
{"text":"Tuscany in Stouffville? Whaat?  I have been to Gallucci's several times now and I must say it is delightful. They do not churn fake food out and for that reason you can not be in a rush to eat here and enjoy the full ambiance of this Estate property. Embrace. Eat. Enjoy.  I ate there today with a party of 5 and it was just lovely. We relaxed with some fine wine, ordered a deli platter and various salads and paninis. We ate outside overlooking the vineyard which was in its early stages. It is not a fast food place nor do they claim to serve a lovely meal in less than 30 minutes. If you truly love food and hanging with friends or going on a date I would suggest this place. I must say the tartufo is a very refreshing dessert choice.You can even pop by to grab a bottle of their award winning wine. I have always had an excellent experience here and I will certainly return.  I would recommend making reservations. This place can get really busy.  Antonio was as pleasant as always."}
{"text":"Gallucci Winery is close to home in Stouffville.   When driving into the Country estate like setting, I was impressed. This is probably one of the nicest vineyard in the area! The Italian Courtyard from entrance is perfect as a backdrop for wedding and special occasions!  Wine tasting charge is waived with purchases. So we ended up buying a bottle or 2. A little pricey for VQA Ontario but it is good to support local business."}
{"text":"Antonio was awesome! He was super friendly and very welcoming. Highly recommend this place! It's very beautiful."}
{"text":"We toured the Winery on Sunday. It's a great place where one can make believe they are in Tuscany!! Received wine tasting with a variety of cheese and crackers. Will come back for brunch soon as there pizzas looked amazing."}
