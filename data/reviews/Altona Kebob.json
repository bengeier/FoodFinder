{"text":"Chicken - 5/5!! Very smoky, and taste tender!! They use real charcoal here smoke everywhere, awesome!! Large portion as well. Excellent, will be bck for chicken only! Haha other meat are normal, not outstanding."}
{"text":"Let me simplify:
Food Quality: Amazing

Time: I've only been here late night (passed 1 AM) so do not go for a fancy atmosphere or a sophisticated crowd!

People behind the cash are very nice people and friendly and customize your food if you ask...

Very good chicken breast, AMAZING TAHDIG, and decent quality koobide and barg...

They also have other dishes, mostly good, but again, if you are looking for something LATE NIGHT, this is the best food you can get..."}
{"text":"Went there based on a friend's recommendation and sadly had a pretty poor experience. Firstly, it looked like the person taking our order didn't seem to want our business; he was rude and not helpful when asked questions.

Sadly, the food didn't help redeem the poor service.  They were very adamant on charging us for hot sauce but failed to mention that a salad or drink came with our meal. 

I'm sure others have had a better experience than myself; maybe, I went on a bad day."}
{"text":"Great food, I really like it.

They only lose a star due to inconsistency in pricing (won't ding them on ambiance since it's more of a hole-in-the-wall and not meant to be a fine-dining establishment).

I ordered the same thing several times and based on the server rice and/or pop may or may not come with the order or the price may be hiked up by a buck (I normally also get the pre-cooked fare so pricing isn't written on the top board). Issue is just with the old lady who, I guess, is on the stingy side. Who knows, perhaps she's the owner and didn't tell the rest of the staff to not include the extras (although first Persian place in the area I've been to that won't include rice with the food).

Last time I went the meatballs were a bit too salty, but didn't mind so much and it can happen anywhere.
Otherwise, I would say give the place a shot and if you can, try to avoid the old lady.

I would recommend take-out only.  Place is a dump in terms of ambiance."}
{"text":"The resto was working a leisurely pace and there was no line or rush. I'm 99% certain the owner took my order. I didn't know much about the food so I asked questions but I felt kind of brushed aside. I wasn't walked through what I would get it was just punched in and I was asked to pay. I really disliked the whole experience. He also very kindly sneezed into his hands in front of me and continued to touch everything. 

I got chicken kebab (leg meat). It was ok. Not the worst, not the best, not worth returning for."}
{"text":"Delicious and good prices. Only downside is that they don't plug the fridge in so the pop is warm."}
{"text":"I work in the late hours so this does the job in filling me up. Its good food, but have been to other joints with more flavourful dishes. Its a great price for persian food."}
{"text":"Heard this place was a mention on Anthony Bourdain T.O. Kabobs were nicely flavored. Think the combos come with a drink, not clear tho. 

Kebabs are set on the grill when ordered, which prevents over cooking, however be prepared to wait a little for your food. Worth the wait. 

Great cheap eat place."}
{"text":"Quality is not good and the place is dirty. There are much better places in North York."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn because although I love their food there the quantity and quality has diminished at Altona's. I always get the chicken breast or koobideh with half salad and half rice and the ratio of rice to salad is always heavily in favor of rice with just a little bit of salad. 

They always forget to add the roasted tomato in my food which is always a bummer when I do a takeout and discover upon arriving home that they have forgotten it again. 

The owner is rude here and is always irritable every time we ask for extra onions/lime/salad. He never seems like he wants our business and never even says a thank you. Although there's a girl there that works sometimes and she is extremely accommodating and friendly. She always knows our orders and nicely gives us extra onions when we ask and sometimes without us even asking. 

If anyone knows a Persian takeout place that serves great kebabs in North York let me know. If you want healthy, fresh Persian food but with terrible customer service, Altona's is for you."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. No respect to for customers. I used to be their customer but after a while I noticed they don't respect customer and stoped buying from them. If you want to try and taste real Persian food , try \"Shater Abbas\" but a bit expensive 



Replying back to your answer: 

You can take feedback for improvement and not disrespecting customers. It happened to me long time priori closing the store for renovations and nowwww you are telling me that I am a lier. So Rude. Im sorry for this business!!"}
{"text":"Most places in the area closed after midnight so happened to drop by this location for a late snack. The service was quick, efficient and friendly even though it was 2am. I'm not sure if it was me being hungry but my meal was quick flavourful and I really enjoyed it. I ordered the combo number 4 - lamb shank with rice, and the portion was huge. I ate half and packed the other half for my lunch the next day! I didn't really like my friend's chicken as much. It was a little dry.. but the LAMB was tender, huge and quite flavourful! 
As for the atmosphere, it's very casual and down to earth. I'm not too sure how the noise level is during the day but after midnight it's very quiet and calm. 
I would recommend this location for a late meal and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Altona Kabob.. a long time standing restaurant nestled in a very busy Persian plaza.  It's known for being featured on Anthony Bourdain's eats which is quite remarkable for a basic neighborhood shop.

This place is always busy and opens until 4am on most nights.  Their food is prepared properly and fresh if you order their koobideh (burger meat Persian style kabob) or the juje which is the chicken kabob version and comes in either chicken breast white meat option or the dark meat leg meat option.  The bbq'd meats are made fresh and hot over the charcoal flames.. 

However they also have an array of variety of selections of stews and soups and even Persian spaghetti that are displayed in the front case. 

The food is pretty tasty and portioned right.  The wait can be long so pre order by calling in instead then pick up. 

The staff people in there are a little strange as they kind of stare at you for a bit and speak in their own language so I'm not sure if they're talking about me.  Soo having said that sometimes I feel strange when picking up the food..  but it's worth it for the stares I get..  just hope they can re-train the staff not to make their customers feel uncomfortable inside especially when they're not Persian.  This may be why I'm reluctant to order at Altona sometimes due to the staff's attitudes.  Not too good."}
{"text":"Nice persian kebab place, friendly staff, always good tasting. One suggestion would be to elevate their salad game."}
{"text":"This is my go-to late night eats spot. You want healthy, hearty, and delicious? Look no further. The kebob is not the creme de la creme but it is satisfyingly tasty and comes in a huge portion. For $10 you can't beat it. Fast service, no bs. Just good classic persian food. Love it."}
{"text":"I had the Kebob Koobideh Combo ($6.99) for takeout at Altona Kebob recently.  It was ok, but nothing really outstanding.  The combo includes the kebobs, rice and a grilled tomato.  

The minced meat kebobs were a good size and you get 2 of them in the combo.  The meat was well grilled and the flavour was good.  The rice was nothing special (you get the regular rice with saffron with the combo, not the barberry rice).  The picture on the wall had 2 grilled tomatoes with the combo, but I only got one, and it was over-grilled and a bit too black for my liking.  I was also given a packet of margarine, and a packet of sumac.  You could buy hot sauce for an additional $0.50.      

Everything was ok, but I'll probably try some of the other places around before going back here.

It's in a strip mall and there is parking in front."}
{"text":"The recently renovated Altona Kebob is fantastic. The owners did a beautiful job of redesigning their entire restaurant. Was very dull and lacking that polished look, now it's filled with nice furniture for dining in, and the bbq section is now moved to the back where the kitchen is located, used to be along the left side of the restaurant ( will provide pictures next time I'm in, shop was very crowded) Somehow, also, they seem to be making foods that are a lot more enjoyable to eat. Koobideh pronounced coo-be- day(ground beef kebab) which is usually what I order, was not dry at all and perfectly seasoned. Spending only 11$ with a drink included,I was more than full. Portions here are not skimpy whatsoever. If you're in the Yonge and finch area you have a wide array of Persian restaurants to try from, I definitely recommend this is on your list of places to try this year. Service is also a plus, always friendly to every customer regardless if that person is of Persian decent."}
{"text":"I came here because the Feseejan is only $6.99. That's the cheapest I've seen anywhere. Super Khorak (SK) has it for $8.99 and so does Taftan. So I got that. My friend got the Vaziri.

I've tried tons of kebob places and frankly, most of them are VERY similar. I think Altona's Vaziri is good, just like almost everywhere else. The Feseejan is noticeably worse than what I had at Taftan.  I guess I get what I paid for. It was still delicious but just more watery than I'd like. It also didn't have a lot of meat. The best Feseejan I had was at Pomegranate Restaurant on College street. That one is hard to beat.

Like in most places, your meal comes with a can of pop. Altona is not the cheapest place and definitely not the most expensive. It's comparable to SK but maybe $1 more or less here and there. Meals come with surmac, rice, tomato. Portion seems about right. 

If I consider their menu selection, I'd prefer SK. SK has a much more complete Iranian menu. Besides, I like going to SK to buy some barbary bread. But if you happened to be in this plaza, it's a fine choice for Iranian food. Besides, this place actually has space for sitting. At SK, it feels a little awkward to eat with all the grocery shoppers walking by you."}
{"text":"Altona Kabob is a small restaurant located in a small plaza that caters to the middle east community. You could drive by or walk by the plaza and not even notice the restaurant.

I had been meaning to try this place because of my love for healthy food and kabobs. I decided on the Vaziri Kabob combo ($12.99 plus tax) which consisted of one skewer of chicken breast and a skewer of kobideh which is a minced meat kabob made from either lamb or ground beef served on a bed of rice with a grilled tomato. The kobideh kabob was perfectly seasoned, tender and fresh. The chicken breast kabob was nicely seasoned but slightly dry and not juicy. The rice was nicely cooked and moist.

Altona Kabob is not a bad option for the area and reasonably priced. The food is good but I wouldn't say that it was exceptional."}
{"text":"Was jonesing for some kebab about a week ago and had this place bookmarked. It's pretty easy to get to by public transit (right near Yonge and Patricia) so that was a plus.

It's a strange space. Eight or so tables, and most of the orders I saw were take-out. I ate there. It doesn't look cafeteria-style, but it kind of was - they called out my order and I took it to my table and got my own cutlery.

I got the vaziri leg (dark meat 4 lyfe). This was one skewer of chicken leg with one skewer of koobideh, plus rice, a grilled tomato, and this citrus-y pickled-tasting onion mixture. A drink was included in the price, which was nice. It was a really good portion and I was stuffed after. The chicken was really moist and quite flavorful and had a bit of char. The koobideh was actually really tasty - I was expecting to prefer the chicken, but I really enjoyed the ground meat. It was quite a fine mince with just a bit of texture. The flavor was great - very meaty.

The rice and tomato were pretty standard - no complaints. The onion stuff was refreshing but I found it a little too tart. I would definitely come back here - good food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great favors, affordable prices and large portions. Each meal comes with a choice of beverage (although not indicated on their menu board/ I was asked to select a drink after my meal arrived. I got the fasenjun combo ($9) and a kobideh kabob on the side (totaling $13.50). I couldn't even finish the entire meal and took half home. I also loved the service as well, it's a small place but it's very clean with attentive service."}
{"text":"Open late.  This small restaurant offers an open barbecue experience.  The lamb I ordered was marinated in such a way that it didn't have that distinctive smell.  Very yummy."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, as I Love this place for its simplicity, straight forward authentic Persian food.
Matter of fact I get out out of my way ignoring the plethora of Iranian restaurants in the area just to eat here.
Yes, I know it is a hole in the wall and yes you eat in take away containers with plastic forks, seating on simple chair but if you're willing to over look that and just enjoy simple food like you were in Tehran than this is a place you got to check.
Oh yes. Did I mention it's really cheap? Less than 10 bucks for a meal with a soft drink.
Cant beat that."}
{"text":"Such a surprising flavor from this small place!
Their Kebab platter was amazing -- very flavorful rice... and their Dolma is great as well..."}
{"text":"I have been to this place few times, and its' one of the better kebab grills in the area, it's newly renovated, really nice setting, it's not a fine dining place. One thing that drives me nuts is lack of salads in all the Persian food places. You got to beg for the salads and instead they give you a hot tomato. It's weird. Sultani is great."}
{"text":"Just because they are open till late. 
Between all the restaurants Altona is the last one to go. But around midnight it's great to be there."}
{"text":"WOO can't believe it's been almost 3 years since the last time i came to this place..

Most middle eastern restaurants who do kababs often turn their kababs dry, and this is where Altona Kabab stands out, their kababs are always juicy and properly marinated.

They have renovated the place and it looks much much better than what they had before, the environment is now spacious and the restaurant looks cleaner.

My favourite is Satareh kabab (One with chicken and beef botis) - $17, get the Garlic yogurt on the side, really adds to the taste.

They are also open till 4 in the morning, so if anybody is looking for late night food (or sehri in Ramadan), this is the place to be."}
{"text":"The delicate pilaf with saffron and barberry was the perfect side to an exquisite lamb kebob. All homemade with great care and love. Worth the drive to Thornhill for lunch and to pick up some Iranian groceries in the strip mall."}
{"text":"Been having kebob dreams as of late...have checked out many places within the vicinity and have to say the kobedieh is the best I have eaten.  Pure dive kinda spot but delicious food."}
{"text":"The actual restaurant is a bit rubbish tbh although there is seating available. However it does beat most places around it that are usually located in a supermarket. Although there have been times when I've found their kababs a bit dry, for most part I think they're excellent. I usually get their jujeh kebab made with chicken leg. The meat is nice and tender and very subtley flavoured with saffron, onions and some other ingridients. They pop their kababs onto the barbeque after you order so you can be sure that you're getting fresh food. They also have rice with barberrys on it and this other rice which had orange zest if im not mistaken. I was hoping that the rice with the barberries would be something like what Brittania is Mumbai serves but unfortunately it doesn't really come close. I believe they're open pretty late too which is always a bonus. A skewer of the chicken kabab wiht rice is about $6.99 add a skewer of beef for $3 more. All meals include a free drink. Also if you're really adventurous try their carbonated yoghurt drink - an acquired taste for sure. Overall highly reccomended."}
{"text":"Came here twice thus far. A good place to come for a quick and reasonable priced persian food craving!

I've tried the following:

Lamb Kebob (~ $14.99)- So juicy, tender, and nicely spiced! A must try!!! A

Barg Kebob (~$12.99) - This is beef steak, but I was disappointed because the beef was pretty dry and tasteless. C

Combo special with chicken, koobideh (ground beef), and lamb kebob for about $20 including tax - Good value and everything tasted great. A meal for 2 people. B+

Pita - This is thin and a bit dry. I prefer getting pita from the grocery store at the next plaza (about a 2 min walk from this place) B-

*Each meal comes with rice, salad or pita and a canned drink. Real good value for the combo! 

Service is great. The cashier gave me extra pita since I couldn't choose between rice or pita. So sweet! The kebobs are made to order so it takes about 10-15 minutes to grill, but there's other stores and bakeries in the area so you can roam around before getting your food. You can eat at the restaurant, but there is limited seating available. They accept cash and credit cards."}
{"text":"We order on UberEATS all the time and this place been my favourite every time I crave middle easter food!"}
{"text":"Most dishes I have tried so far, has been dry and with low quality. The staff are not friendly either. Growing up with good quality Persian food I would not recommend  this to anyone especially of you are trying to give the first taste of Persian food to someone you care about."}
{"text":"Made to order so it takes awhile for them to cook the meat. Would like to know what the other food/salad in their trays were as the menu only showed a selected options. The chicken was cooked really well but would have liked more flavour on it."}
{"text":"Fast food Chello kebab while shopping, make your stop here. Nothing glamorous here but the great quality fresh grilled kebabs."}
{"text":"Have had better kobideh at other restaurants. But their leg chicken kabob here is fantastic. They just switched from butter to margarine. Not sure most ppl would care but I do. Well still really good food and very fairly priced for the area and amount (one plate can feed two people in my opinion.)"}
{"text":"Tender meat and aromatic rice, with a sweet grilled tomato which includes a soda with most of their combos. 

Great tasting meat, very filling and worth the trip. Really, it did feel like a road trip for the search was on for about 15 mins until it hit me! \"Check yelp pics and reviews for clues! Doh!!! (homer's voice)\" 

Downside/reason for 3 stars: tight parking + angry drivers and not a lot of tables available for dining in. 

Great plaza for fast food choices but went with this one based on other yelp reviews. Did the job, full and happy."}
{"text":"Used to be very good. Now they don't care. I found a hair in my kebab. I now goto other kebab places in the vicinity. Owner is very stuck up."}
{"text":"Took friends here from abroad. They have never had middle eastern food before and they loved it! It was so tasty. The wait wasnt long and the owner was super helpful. He even gave us a sample of what Iranians love. Love this place. Great service. Super attentive. Great food. Huge portions too! Will come again. 

F.i.y Parking is a nightmare."}
{"text":"This place is really hard to find at first, it blends in with all the middle eastern restaurants and store in that plaza. If you want fast and cheap Iranian food and doesn't care about cleanliness, this is your spot. 

$6.99 for Koobideh meal with a drink of your choice.
You get more than what you pay for. The portion is huge, you get a big box filled to the top for only 7$"}
{"text":"Decided to grab a late night snack the other day after my Salsa Dance class. My dance classmate suggested this place as we were talking about Persian food. I have only had Persian food once prior to this experience about a year ago and enjoyed it then. It was 11 pm and I couldn't believe how many people were inside this little fast food joint. The place was simple in design but open faced. This means I was able to watch the workers cook my Kebob's on the grill. We were able to see them arrange our plate. We shared a beef and chicken kebob over yellow rice with a flame grill tomato. Flavors were great. Enjoyed the seasoning they used in their dish. 

I probably wouldn't feel comfortable going in to this place without someone who speaks the language. The reason I mention this is because English was second in both Signage and Speaking. I'm sure they would be helpful but I wouldn't want to be into a position of not knowing :)

All in all great experience and great food"}
{"text":"Altona Kebob is back!!! The period when they were closed for renovations was a sad time, and my wife refused to have Koobideh from anywhere else in the city. Luckily, when they reopened, the food was just as delicious as we remembered, prices were still cheaper than most other places in the city, and the consistency was still there. You know that you are bound to get a delicious plate of food every time you order. 5 star's all around!"}
{"text":"This place serves up average kebobs but charges a good deal. There is alot of rice and not enough meet, so you are often left with a large pile of white rice and no way of consuming it. The koobideh is average. The meat could use a bit more spice."}
{"text":"I ordered catering for about 30 people. Altona was the only place that would do delivery, online payment and custom menu.

They put together a nice selection of different kebabs, two sorts of rice and a lot of excellent salad.

Everyone was very pleased with the quality of the food and I would (and will) order from there again for one of the next company events."}
