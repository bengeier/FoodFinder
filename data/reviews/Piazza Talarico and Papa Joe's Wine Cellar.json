{"text":"Good place. The food has a homemade feel, and there is a good wine selection. Service is great and they have a no-tip model (which I assume and hope means they pay decent benefits). The place is tiny, and only for small parties. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The AC must have been broken because it was so hot and humid inside.  Food was FINE, but not good-not authentic Italian food whatsoever (I'm half Italian and spent a lot of time in Italy). I would give 3 star because the wine slushees were good..... but the food and service brings it back down to a 1 star. They offered us a free dessert for the WAIT..... but then it took another 20 minutes so we left before it came out...."}
{"text":"We have been really excited for this restaurant to open just blocks from our house. The outside looks so cute and loved the concept. We went the other night to try it out. Our food wasn't bad but there was nothing memorable about it that had me wanting more. With other Italian restaurants in the area for the same price point that serve handmade pasta you would think they would be a little competitive food wise. I ordered a salad and the pasta with marinara sauce and it wasn't bad but was on par with what I would make at home. My boyfriend got the baked maccheroni and he didn't even finish it which was very unlike him. Both were served with a slice of cold, not stale but not super fresh bread. We loved our wine, I will go back and buy some for sure. I hope they grow as time passes and develop the recipes a bit more!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place. The servers and bartender were are welcoming and informative. Highly recommend the wine slushee- super hard to stop sipping. The \"blue and white\" is also a good option. I recommend this place for a nice, casual date. Or a nice catch up with friends"}
{"text":"Wow and wow some more! These two sisters are dynamite restaurateurs. They took Nona's recipes, added some (really good) homemade wine and came up with the best real mama's Italian food in  Pittsburgh.
Please don't everyone come and ruin for us neighbors."}
{"text":"We meandered in on a lazy Saturday walk and I was very pleasantly surprised by the wines! So the negatives first: none of the grapes are local at all (sourced from Chile, California, and Italy, predominantly). The meads that ARE locally sourced weren't our thing (sweeter than we tend to prefer). HOWEVER, these wines are truly something special. Our two favorites were the montepulciano (a light red in color, full in flavor; layered notes of plum, balsamic vinegar, but yet refreshing). Second favorite was the tannat, a tannic rich, full bodied and DEEP red wine. Impressive flavor and body for wines produced (if not grown) locally. You can buy the wine by the glass, carafe or bottle, and while they aren't cheap (around $9/glass, more than $20 for a bottle), the quality is great and the local experience is lovely. I'm happy to see a place that takes pride in Pittsburgh's little Italy and bringing it into the 21st century while paying homage to its roots. 

We shared a glass of the montepulciano in the back in the open air garden. I couldn't have asked for a lovelier experience, and I can't wait to come back and try the food. Excellent work!"}
{"text":"This's place probably the best pizza joint in Pittsburgh , foods are delicious , warm serving. The wine ( tanat) is my favorite. The workers are amazingly friendly and warm welcoming, Sometimes i stop at the restaurant just to said hello and have a veur du vain rouge. The place is always clean, neat fancy looking."}
{"text":"I have a partially amazing/partially concerning review of this place. 

So I called ahead of time to ask what time a party of 6 should arrive in order to not really have a wait. She said they get busy around 6-630 so before that. Ok cool. Half of us arrived around 445 and then the rest of us trickled in till about 530. We weren't seated the whole time (stood at the bar and what not) and no one was in the restaurant but us. 

The gentleman serving the wine was extremely kind and said that his daughter is usually there not him so he wasn't sure of a few things. No problem. We ordered 2 meat and cheese plates and some carafes of wine for all of us. 

For entrees we kinda went overboard and ordered like everything. We ordered a family portion of grandmas sauce, a margherita and Quattro formaggi pizza, and they were nice enough to make us a family portion of the pasta with garlic and oil (forget the name) even though it's not on the menu. We also ordered the sausage and peppers entree and the maccherroni. 


1. Quattro formaggio pizza was great
2. Olive oil pasta was ok, but really could use some work. I could regularly make that at my house on my own. 
3. Grandmas sauce- also very good
4. Margherita -good but not the star of the show
5. Maccheroni- different but I liked it! 

Ok so now here is where it starts to get weird. At this point it starts to get crowded but we had food coming the whole time. We also ordered dessert which I will get to. But a woman walks in who I believe either is a family member or works there with a party of 6 and she wants our table. Let's call her Janet with the striped sweater. Well Janet was extremely rude and continuously stood there and stared us down. Or I would see her come close to our table then go and walk over and talk to her party. I wouldn't even mention this if it wasn't blatantly obvious she was somehow connected to the restaurant because she was walking in the kitchen and getting herself wine, but if you in any way represent a restaurant you should not act this way. Also, at this point we had ordered 2 desserts and they get busy so we waited for them. We weren't mad about waiting I get they are busy and it's a small place, so the fact she was STILL staring us down was uncalled for. I don't feel the need to deduct more for her because the service was very warm and kind and our food was good and I want others to experience that, but if I would have found out she was an actual employee, I would have. 

Anyways, the zeppoli were amazing along with the Nutella pizza!"}
{"text":"Great wood fired pizzas 

I'm usually not much of a wine guy, but the Sangria slushees are a must-have!"}
{"text":"This is a very small place.  One table for 4 or 5.  Two tables for 4 that they split into two tops also and 3 counter seats on each side of the door looking out the front window.  The tables are small.  Also, a place to stand at the wine bar.  There is a patio that will help in the warmer weather.
You can have a small tasting of the wine to decide which wine you prefer to order. 
You order at the bar and get a number so the food can be delivered to you at your table or counter.  We tasted a couple of the wines and then made our choice.  Some of the wines we liked but a couple seemed to lack fruit and some of the wine qualities that we enjoy.
We ordered a Caprese salad that had pretty good tomatoes for this time of year, fresh mozzarella, olive oil balsamic and a few little stands for basil.  Surprised at the lack of basil.  Really could have had one more leaf cut up and put on some of the tomatoes and mozzarella. We also ordered a Margherita pizza.  The pizza come way to soon!  We were about half done with the salad and the pizza is served.  But there is not room on the tiny table for a salad, our wine glasses, two water glasses and the pizza.  Did I mention that the table and place were tiny?  So we had the salad boxed and placed the pizza on our table.    As to the pizza, it is a thin crust and OK tasting.  Due to the closeness of the tables we did talk a little with our neighbors and they had some pasta with Grandma's sauce and they said they enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Such good pizza! This place is awesome -- fantastic service and food. We can't wait to come back! It would be a mistake to pass this place up!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to go for some time now and hey extended their hours to 9 so we went! First they have homemade wine and it was amazing! Try the tattan wine (spelling?!) It's fantastic! 

We got the pizza ( crust is perfect), greens and beans - highly recommend and grandmas rigatoni. The sauce is super good - just the right amount of sweet and the meatballs are delicious! 

The service is on par, and they pay their servers a living wage so no tipping - overall really love the concept and the food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"There was a group of us having an unusual evening of work on a Tuesday evening - but needed to grab dinner before hand.  Since Piazza Talarico was open and just up the street we decided this was the destination of choice!

We were NOT disappointed.  The set up is a little different than what you are used to in restaurants - you get your menu and order when you walk in, get a number and take a seat.  

We placed our order and took a seat.  Piazza Talarico has yet to have their grand opening - they are shooting for January.  But this is not a reason not to go.  Everything was utter perfection - the food (we all shared everything) - scallops, meat/cheese plate, caprese salad, chicken piccata, and pizza.  It was...so. so. so. very good.  

We all had different glasses of wine which also - did not disappoint.  The dessert - was amazing.  Just every morsel was phenomenal.  

I look forward to January when they have their grand opening and expand their hours.  If you haven't been (which by the lack of reviews you haven't!)  Go.  Quick.  You don't want to miss it."}
{"text":"We found this spot in one of our favorite neighborhoods surrounding the city of Pittsburgh.  The restaurant is quaint and has an authentic Italian ambiance to go with the amazing, authentic Italian food.  You MUST try the meatballs. The Southern Italian menu they created has a bit of everything you desire at an Italian restaurant.  One last, very important, and the icing on the cake of this restaurant- they make their own wine!  Being a wine connoisseur, their wine ranges from Malbec to Frascati and you would think it came straight from Italy. The service is impeccable and you immediately feel the love this family business bestows on all who enter:) We will visit frequently."}
{"text":"Fried zucchini and the red marinara sauce the plate came with were so, so good--crisp and very flavorful. We also loved our veggie pizza and caprese salad. What a lovely place to have in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is such a quaint family owned place! Immediately greeted and chatted with. The interior is small but intimate. The wine bar is the best! You get to sample some of their homemade wines and they even have a wine slushie!

Dinner was beyond fantastic! We started with the zucchini, it was cooked crisp and delicious. Everyone at the table ordered something different and we all shared. The standout was definitely the maccheroni; I'm still craving this today! Everything was delicious though, I would definitely suggest the meatballs. 

We had the Nutella pizza for deserve, did not disappoint! 

The ONLY critique I would have would be that it would be nicer for a little bit bigger portion for the cost (and because leftovers!). Otherwise, I will definitely be back time and time again. Definitely a new gem in Lawrenceville!"}
