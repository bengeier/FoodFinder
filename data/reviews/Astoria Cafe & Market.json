{"text":"Our second visit affirmed our first impression! Fantastic, unique, flavor-filled dishes in a bright, inviting space on Detroit Ave. Small plates, large plates, pizzas, salads and desserts served at comfortable tables adjacent to retail area that includes a huge cheese case, olive bar and imported foods.  This time our table ordered Cod Sartorini with grilled vegetables, summer squash and zucchini noodles with ramps, lamb chops and a magnificent plate of lamb/veal/ricotta ravioli. Each meal was superb and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"These people know how to cook. I had the white fish and my date had the seafood pasta. The fish was out of this world - great flavors that anyone would appreciate. The seafood pasta was creamy and comforting. The only minuscule complaint is that the pasta may have benefited from a few pieces of bread to mop up the sauce.   The service was on point - no complaints at all. The drink menu offered solid options and the pricing was reasonable. My date said he couldn't choose what to order because everything sounded appealing - very rare for him. We are looking forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"Best stuffed grape leaves in Cleveland. Owners are incredibly nice and welcoming. Food is very good and menu has a wide range of items that can accommodate most food allergies. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I absolutely had to write a review from the fantastic experience we had! We came for a birthday dinner, while we were waiting, George was very friendly and helped cash me out. Trent, who I believe is the manager, took great care of us along with Tim who was our waiter. The place has a great relaxed atmosphere! The food...the food...was amazing!!! Their menu has so much delicious things to offer. I love going to a place where I just want everything on the menu! Everything we got was delicious and the presentation was great! There was literally not a single thing wrong the whole night. We were treated exceptionally! Thank you for the great experience! I am definitely recommending you guys and coming back!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!!!! We come here very frequently and love everything! We love the mushroom pizza, lamb chops, and all their cheese and meats. You really can't go wrong there. Everything we have tried has been so yummy."}
{"text":"Overall good experience but very dissapointed with salad. Good atmosphere, very friendly wait staff, good variety of large and small plates. Good section of beers. I got the French onion soup, my husband the lentil salad and we shared the octopus appetizer. Octopus was tender and delicious. Soup was also very good. The lentil salad was delicious but miniscule. For $14 the salad should have been three times the size. There was no ingredient in the small salad to justify the price tag. My husband left still very hungry."}
{"text":"My husband and I attended a private event here recently and we were extremely impressed.  The service was impeccable, the staff super friendly and attentive.  Trent the manager was a delight, and our server Marybeth was a blast!!  It was obvious that they really enjoyed working here.  All of the food was delicious and perfectly prepared.  We were even able to do a little shopping at the end of the evening. We are huge cheese fans.  There is a grand selection and being able to sample some of the items we were less famliar with was a great treat and a wonderful way to help us find just what we wanted.  We are looking forward to finding another evening sooner to visit with friends for drinks and dinner.  Astoria is a phenomenal addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great vibe in this place. Friendly, knowledgeable staff, nice to wander around, simple but appealing bar. We sampled from the olive bar and ordered food to go: arugula sopressata salad (delicious), grilled artichokes (underwhelming), stuffed peppadews (delicious and a little spicy), and the clear winner, a Mediterranean Chicken Ciabatta sandwich. There were so many great flavors on this sandwich, the ciabiatta was grilled just crispy enough so the flavor was there but you didn't feel like you would scrape the roof of your mouth and sliced thin in perfect proportion to the sandwich fillings, AND, I am not a huge fan of this adjective, but sometimes it can't be avoided, the chicken was so moist. Overall, a great addition to the neighborhood. Great place to grab an after work drink and a snack, pick up a reasonably-priced meal to go, find a nice cheese and/or wine to take to someone's house, and I noticed some frozen baklava and spanakopita that I will definitely check out at some point. I hope there isn't a negative impact on the Gordon Square Market, but I'm sure the GSM will still be the most efficient stop for a beer run and they're open later."}
{"text":"We had seen this restaurant under construction over the past couple of years and decided to  try it. Glad  we did. We had the salad with grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red and green peppers, greek olives and purple onions with EVOO. And pizza with wonderful tomato sauce, prosciutto, mozzarella and arugula. And skewered grilled pork with risotto and a side salad.  Everything was tasty, plated well and fresh. Wish we had more time, but we'll be back for sure. Then we'll try the wine or full service bar."}
{"text":"My wife and I went last Saturday and had a great experience.  The atmosphere is relaxed and the food was excellent.  I thought the menu was straightforward and approachable.  It is clear that they are focused simply on fresh, high quality choices and they certainly delivered.  Great beer selection as well, particularly the Zaftig Brewing options.  The manager, Trent, is pleasant and attentive without being overbearing and the server, Mary Beth, was excellent as well.  We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Outstanding food & service! Came here for dinner with a group of friends before heading to Summer Solstice and we loved every bite. The pictures speak for itself. Marybeth was our waitress and she was excellent! Great ambiance as well. Will definitely come back here next time in Cleveland."}
{"text":"You certainly need a reservation to eat here, but it's totally worth it. The staff is friendly and accommodating and the food is amazing. There are plenty of options, and it's so nice to be able to get small plates and charcuterie boards. Everything I've tried has been so good. Plus, there beverage menu is extensive and great. I haven't made it to brunch, but I love going for dinner. It's can get pricey depending on what you order, but there's easily something for everyone."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic dinner here with a group of friends. The food was delicious, the service was great and the company was even better. I got the Ahi Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, which I really thought would be served warm, but they were cold. Still delicious though. I also split a pepperoni pizza with my boyfriend, which had a light and fluffy crust. It was super filling but great."}
{"text":"What a great place! Brunch was awesome. Duck confit and eggs... very tasty! Scallops and crab eyes Benedict... scallops were best I have had in a long time. Cocktails were tasty and well balanced. Don't miss out on a meal here! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of Astoria! I have come here a few times and the food is outstanding! I love bringing new people here because they don't expect the \"Wow\" factor in food because they think it's just a store, but it is so much more!   I have tried everything from the Pizza to the Shrimp and Feta to the Pita Fries and the ever so amazing Scallops. Happy hour is offered throughout the whole place not just at the bar which gets two thumbs up from me! It's refreshing to have an upscale mediterranean restaurant that is affordable and in a neighborhood that doesn't have another menu like it."}
{"text":"We finally ate dinner here. The place was packed on a Friday night so we were glad we made a reservation. Saganaki and Tortilla Eapañola were terrific. The side Greek salad was okay. My hubs said the sauce on his lamb was way too overpowering.  Service was pretty good. They have such an interesting menu with all the cheese boards, too. A great place for dinner, no doubt.  I love the concept...half market, half Cafe.  And finally a place that sells Kasseri cheese so I can make saganaki at home!  You will find the usual \"local\" suspects like Mediterra bread, Ohio City Pasta, etc.  Lots of Greek and Mediterranean foods, both as ingredients and in-house prepared foods. Some of the condiments are very pricey.  I look forward to going there and having a drink at the bar and having lunch.  They have an awesome wine selection--"}
{"text":"Oh I absolutely LOVE this place!!! I discovered it a few wks before I left Cleveland for good. The first time I went I tried the chicken avgolemono which was superb!! It has a bit of tang from the lemon that just took it over the top!  The shrimp orzo and feta was also delicious!!! Very very flavorful! And a huge helping! The grilled lamb paidakia is delicious too! I've never had polenta before and always thought it would taste weird but it was ooooooohhh yummmmm! The lamb came with dill that just took the dish to another level! The calamari and cod frito was the only thing I wasn't absolutely crazy about.....it was just calamari. There's only one place that has every had to die for calamari and it wasn't this! We also had the Chilean sea bass, whole roasted that was delicious!!! It's no longer on the menu but there are a lot of other things that I'd like to try!  Clevelander's please check this place out! It's one of the best restaurants in a city full of good eats!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch, excellent menu! We had the breakfast board- that was the highlight! Deliciousness! We had an order of pork skewers and eggs... it was juicy and cooked with perfection. Excellent flavors, not to greasy and fluffy scrambled eggs! My new favorite brunch place now, I think it's fresh, tasty and nice addition to cleveland food scene!!"}
{"text":"Food was great as I expected from reading the menu. Went on a Sunday for brunch and wish they had brunch for the rest of the week. Great one stop shop with the wine, food and ingredients you can grab from there as well. First of its kind I've seen. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner on a random Wednesday. We got easy street parking and were sat quickly. We didn't know what to expect as we had only seen the place in passing. Wednesday was $10 12\" pizza  night which included 1 topping. Additional toppings were $1.50. We also had the Caesar kale salad. The salad was a remarkable version of a Caesar. The pizza had a nice crust with great crisp texture. There is also a market inside which has an olive bar and a cheese deli. Tons of wines to choose from and so much more. We came for dinner and realized it was more of an experience."}
{"text":"I kind of adore this place, so I just needed to wax poetic to everyone about it. If you are a foodie dork like I am, there's no way you'll be disappointed. If you get overly excited about large selections of beans and grains, step inside. If you have ever sought a container of feta cheese that's larger than your own head, they've got you covered. If you need enough olive oil to fill a reasonably sized bathtub, they will not let you down.   So, on top of my giddiness about about the grocery section, they also serve food and drinks, which are equally awesome. I always judge restuarants by their hummus and fancy-pants drinks, and Astoria easily passed those tests. In addition, the staff were all very nice and attentive. I wasn't overly hungry when I visited, which was very disappointing, because the whole menu looked very tempting. I will certainly be back to sample more soon!"}
{"text":"Cream of cauliflower was excellent, taste like a healthy version of potato soup. The House Spread apps was so fresh and the best tzatziki I've had! Meatballs and mussels are killer too! Must try! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had lunch on a Saturday and my wife and I were super impressed. The falafel was moist and full of flavor (probably the best falafel I've had), the pita was soft, and the greens were fresh. Everything was superbly prepared, with clean flavor and just the right amount of dressing (sometimes Mediterranean places can go too heavy on the oil imo).   Added bonus: clean, inviting space, with an appealing market connected to it."}
{"text":"Aubrey is the awesome bartender! We've been here twice now. The food is incredible,reasonably priced, and the service has been stellar both times. Saganaki is not on the menu, however, we had an adventurous chef. We've had the pizza, hummus, olives, cheese board, multiple types of wine. My favorite dish has to be the Spanish chickpea & spinach stew with ginger. Big ginger taste, perfectly paired with the other spices in the dish...excellent! Everyone is so nice and accommodating. Trent has made some amazing drink concoctions, and Steve kept us in the samples. Thank god we live close! We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Best meal I have had in a while.  The ravioli and meatballs were INCREDIBLE!!! mussels and octopus were also amazing. Can't wait to go back and try more items"}
{"text":"Astoria had been open since December 2016, and noticed it for the first time last night.  Stopped here for brunch and saw the most amazing menu, very creative and unique with wonderful contrasting flavors in each selection. The menu is attached and the food meets the expectations created in the descriptions."}
{"text":"There is so much vegetarian food here I don't know where to start. I loved the fat grape leaves and tasty vegetarian Greek salad sandwich inside some of the best pita bread I've ever had. The staff could not have been friendlier."}
{"text":"Woahhhh. Amazing!!!! This place is so beautiful. The food is amazing. I have a lactose allergy and they were super accommodating. The chef is vegan so they have vegan options. Love love it.    Great little shop as well to pick up some wine and speciality foods."}
{"text":"I have been excitedly awaiting this opening and was able to get there on opening day. I had a fig cocktail (it had a name, but my memory isn't working) and I split a small cheese board with my friend. I actually don't think the cheese board was officially on the menu but they made it on request. Three delicious cheeses with lavender honey,  nuts, and little toasts. I absolutely love the ambiance. Modern, classy, romantic, but casual. The market has several unique foods, spreads, cheeses, wines, etc. Perfect for the foodie who wants to take something fun home or even great to pick up little hostess gifts for the holidays. On my next trip, I plan on doing a little shopping for myself. Welcome, Astoria, to my favorite neighborhood in the CLE!"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood with my wife and we went there for lunch may 25, 2017 based on yelp reviews.  We were disappointed.  I had a Greek salad with  tzatziki . The salad was a letdown and the tzatziki tasted like it was missing greek yogurt and garlic.  Big disappointment.  My wife had a Daily special which was a po Boy with Soft Shell Crab.  This tasted mostly like fried coating with minimal crab flavor.     We won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Finally I made it here! Such a convenient place to run and get nice wine or cheese plate items (for last minute guest hosting--nothing like a quick cheese board to impress!), otherwise you'd have to hope to make it to market hours/trek through the grocery store. We popped in for a snack and a drink and weren't disappointed. They had very affordable wines and we picked our own and opened it there for a small cork fee (2.50 for wines under $15, $5 for wines over). We had a delicious brunch board which tasted amazing and had beautiful presentation. I was completely impressed when the cheese they served looked so much like a carnation, I was at first disappointed there was only one cheese on the board--I thought it was a flower for decoration! It's the little things in life, right? The brunch board also had three adorable hard boiled quail eggs (although I wish they were soft boiled.). We also tried the brunch pizza. My husband liked it a lot, especially the puffy crust. I thought it was a little busy with ingredients for my liking (I still ate two pieces!). The menu looks great for lunch and dinner so I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious margarita pizza here last night along with a perfect martini. All at a very modest price. Service was excellent, and one of the owners took time to say hello and introduce himself.  Would like to see a few more items on the menu, but I am sure that will come before long."}
{"text":"Wow .. it's been an hour and no food .. I did get a nice salad 30 minutes ago ... bummed thought it would be great.  Waitress has attitude as well.  No manager comes over .. waitress has not been by to say sorry.  Ok the food is great!  So I will come back but God please improve the service or at least get me somebody who can be proactive about an hour wait."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and really enoy stopping by here when we don't feel like cooking. I love the Mediterranean options for food- a good mix of greek, arabic, and Italian food options. You can tell the place is family run qnd it has a lot of \"warmth\" in that sense. Cocktails are so good too! It's a little more expensive than a place like Aladdins, for example, but it warrants the price."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch in the neighborhood. The crowd was a bit bougie for where we are. Think Lexus and furs set. I can tell why they trekked over here the food was great. We split the spanakopita and stuffed French toast. Both were high quality and things I would order again. The win went to the spanakopita which was flaky and came with a great sauce.  The only negative was we asked for a cocktail menu and were told they were all out, didn't ever try to loop back and offer one. We were there later in the brunch day and it seemed rushed. Will definitely come back and check out happy hour."}
{"text":"Best brunch in the city! Was greeted with a warm welcome and a steaming cup of joe, my friend got a latte. It was great to see they offered other beverages too such as mimosas, tea, and various coffee beverages. I ordered the Tortilla Espanola, it was so decadent and tasty. My friend ordered the breakfast pizza which was a very generous portion. Our server assisted us with questions about the menu, and was on top of everything. You can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Everything. Vegan and gf options galore. Utilize the people there that LOVE food and wine and ask for recommendations. I always pop in and get them to tell me what wines are their favorites. Buy a few bottles and take them home. I love that the wines on the market side are good quality but not absurdly expensive. Finally some real wine in Ohio city."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I'm so excited that it finally opened! We have literally been waiting years for this place. The food and groceries here are fresh and delicious. I'll have to go back to try the deli stuff. There's a nice seating area, and I could definitely sit here and work. Really happy it's down the street from me too!"}
{"text":"How have I been unaware of this place!!!   Absolutely loved it.  Pita fries to start....some kind of yogurt sauce with chickpeas in it and warm pita chips:  so good.   Very affordable wine list as well.  Great service.  Can't wait to come back and try their brunch!   Or even just stop in to the market area and pick up some wine and food to take home."}
{"text":"I consider myself a gazpacho aficionado so of course I order the heirloom tomato gazpacho at Astoria Cafe & Market after my better half noshed his way through the west side Market a few miles away. Imagine my surprise - an amuse bouche if you will when the deftly balanced gazpacho had watermelon in it. It's quite honestly one of the best things I've ever eaten. EVER. I observed artfully prepared pizzas and salads and cheese boards swirling around me amidst cases of charcuterie and olives and such....Chef Jamie is a rock star and in Cleveland - that's no easy feat...."}
{"text":"The food is beautifully presented and wonderfully executed.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of food at this place.  The service was great too.  While the prices are not cheap, the quality of the execution and of the ingredients justify it.  Happy hour is nice to have, but honestly most offerings save at most $1 or $2.  I think most of them are not any cheaper at all, which is a bit baffling to me."}
{"text":"This review is specific to the carry out! I haven't eaten at the restaurant portion of the business yet but hope to do so soon, especially to check out their great happy hour. The space is really lovely, right on Detroit with tons of windows. It was busy when I stopped in about 7:30 pm on a Thursday evening. I parked in the lot on the side of the building, off of the alley and there was a parking attendant out there keeping an eye on things (maybe so people visiting other businesses weren't using the spaces). I grabbed a sandwich with fresh meats and arugula that came with a side of Isreali cous cous, and some spicy feta dip with pita chips. Their huge selection of wines, cheeses, and other snacks and treats also looked appealing. This is a lovely neighborhood spot with so much to offer!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! We tried the dolmedes for app and then two sandwiches w/ fries and one with couscous salad. We couldn't have been more impressed. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!  We had the calamari appetizer and then shared the ahi tuna, lamb lollipops and chicken skewers.  Everything was prepared perfectly and the service was the excellent!  Don't let the construction deter you.  It was great and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here three times. The first time we (me + wife + friend) were just looking to try an appetizer and stayed for a few drinks, apps, and dinner. After dinner we bought a couple bottles of wine to take home (note: the wine selection is modest in offerings but quite good overall).  The second time we (me + wife) went we had dinner and bought LOTS of goodies (mainly meats and cheeses for a party at our house). We bought packaged meats but got the full treatment with the cheeses - meaning the lovely young man behind the counter was exceedingly patient with us (we don't know much about this stuff) and sampled numerous excellent cheeses. We bought four different ones (my favorite was a goat cheese).   The third time we (me + wife) came for a ticketed-event scotch tasting. It was amazing. The staff was great because they had an unexpectedly large turnout and moved us from the front (tight quarters) to a lovely private room in the back. Awesome scotch and great food pairings/palette cleansers (including meats, cheeses, and even tiny offerings of creme brûlée that were delicious).  I only offer constructive criticism: during the scotch tasting we would gladly have ordered off of the food menu offered in the dining room in the storefront (the pairings were great but the scotch pours were generous so we could have used more food).   This is a new favorite in the Detroit Shoreway neighborhood and will be coming back frequently. Come for apps or dinner and leave with groceries!"}
{"text":"This is a super cool concept that I've seen in Europe before so I was excited to try it out. We shopped around the store for awhile. It is small but had a variety of food and wines from different countries. It also has some deli meat and cheeses. The olive bar is one of the best parts (if you like olives). However, the food was expensive, came in tiny portions and was sub par. I was just underwhelmed and expected more. The drinks, again... expensive, but good. Service was good. I would be willing to try again because I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super cute marketplace when you walk in selling wine, cheeses and olives with great customer service. Me and my husband went for a Sunday brunch and was surprised how quiet it was, we were seated right away. Our food was amazing! One of the best brunches I've ever had! I definitely would recommend and will be returning! Great brunch at Astoria!"}
{"text":"I feel like three stars is an appropriate rating. Let me explain...  Came here on a Wednesday evening with a group of nine. I started off at the bar with a friend and the young female bartender was so friendly that I tipped her without even had ordered anything. When we moved to our table the waitress there did not seem as pleasant, I'm not really sure what her issue was, but she did not give off the same genuine friendly vibe as her co-worker, instead she seemed a little displeased/annoyed with us?  For atmosphere I really enjoy Astoria, big open space, with one side a market with some interesting items and the other side some cozy seating. You can shop for some unique goods or have a drink at the bar and people watch through the huge window. I also like how their menu changes frequently to keep the options fresh and creative. If they could expand their cocktail list I think that would be great.   For food I got the: *Shrimp and Crab Bisque $7 - texture was thinner than I expected, more like a broth with a little cream in it. Taste was not bad, maybe just different than I am used to, I would probably not get this again. One dining companion really pleased with their soup.  *Crispy Calamari and Grouper $12 - I enjoyed the 2 strips of fish, the calamari I kept getting the taste of salt. Would probably not get this again.  *Pizza Prosciutto Crudo e Ruccola $14 - Looked amazing, but for me the taste did not match the looks, just meh and would not get again. I did get it for to-go, so not sure if that was the problem? Others who got this pizza seemed to like it.   This place has gotten really good reviews so I was looking forward to trying it, but I suppose the best way for me to describe how I feel about the food is indifferent. It wasn't bad at all, but also not anything that I really enjoyed and would run back to get again. Nothing stood out to me as really tasty. However, everyone in our group did seem to have a good time and so I am not ready to throw in the towel on Astoria just yet. Their spaghetti and meatball dish looked really good and I'd like to check out their meat and cheese boards. I would visit there again and I do suggest you give them a try."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place! Half is a supermarket, half is bar/restaurant. We were seated immediately and our server could not have been friendlier. The owner even stopped by and let us sample wine to make sure we liked it before ordering. The food was DELICIOUS! We split a cheese plate, garden salads and a pizza. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  NYC in Gordon Square.  Fabulous fresh food.  Mostly Greek or Greek inspired.  Fabulous service.  Pizza to die for and salads, too.   I can't wait to return.  I'm dreaming of the pita fries with the feta chickpea concoction."}
{"text":"This is for the market only, but I can't wait to get back to eat in the restaurant! Kesha, behind the cheese counter, is AWESOME! Very helpful, and let me know right away that she's a \"try before you buy\" girl - so I sampled some delicious cheeses and bought them!!! HUGE selection of cheeses from all over, definitely need to keep trying and buying! I also checked out their selection of jarred and tinned foods, cool selections! I'm partial to cornichons, so I bought some... and hubby loves mustard, so I got a new one for him to try. In the salumi/charcuterie case, they had Delaware Fireball from Smoking Goose! I freaking love that stuff! Also guanciale and some nice sausages. Had to also also check out the olive bar, more great selections... brought kalamatas and castelvetranos home for snacking. The employees I dealt with (especially Kesha!) were super friendly and knowledgeable! They even sent me home with all three of their current menus! I'll definitely be back!  Made it back for lunch... SO GOOD! Split a cheese and charcuterie board, 3 cheeses and 3 meats, olives, cipollines, cornichons, whole grain mustard, mousse and crostini. Great selection and perfect to nibble while waiting for my Lamb and Short Rib Burger.. which was a messy, yummy, awesome sandwich!  Highly recommend Astoria... already thinking about when I can get there again!"}
{"text":"I went to Astoria a few weeks ago for my first unofficial Yelp Elite event. I wasn't sure what to expect since it's a marketplace and restaurant, but it was a great and unique concept (although I think this is a new trend). Part of the space had some market options that you could purchase and the other portion had a bar and restaurant. Their website says their menu changes frequently so it has a sampling of what they offer, but it may vary when you get there.   It was a cold and snowy night so I had soup on my mind. I ordered the chicken and dumpling soup which was AMAZING and may even be better than my mom's (she'd be so mad at me for saying that). It certainly hit the spot that night.There was a lobster bisque on the menu that sounded amazing but it also sounded really heavy and I didn't want something like that. However, people at our table ordered it and said it wasn't heavy at all so I'm kinda sad I didn't try that. I then ordered the garden salad with chicken. It was huge for a regular salad. It was a lot of food so I left full.   I want to go back and try their brunch. From the other reviews and the looks of what they have online it looks amazing. Gordon Square is definitely a new, hip restaurant spot in Cleveland and it's worth checking out what they have to offer here."}
{"text":"Unique theme in an area very well saturated with trendy restaurants. Fabulous assortment of charcuterie, beer, wine and many different dishes. A very consistent quality of dishes that don't try to be trendy. Yet very upscale!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a countless amount of times since it opened a few months ago and today was the day I made my first visit. I'd say it lived up to the wait.  Came  in for dinner and shared between 2 people including myself ordered one small plate and one large plate. The small plate was the Lamb Chop with polenta.  This lamb was cooked perfectly and I'm usually not the biggest fan of polenta however this was quite good also. It had the texture of fantastically made grits. The large plate was the seafood pasta la provencale. This was a very good choice as well. The base for the meal which was the sauce was incredible and the pasta and accompanying seafood was on point as well. I'd easily order both of these items again. Lastly the location is composed of a restaurant and store which aside from being a very cool concept , makes  buying things things to go very easy. I definitely will be visiting this place again in the future."}
{"text":"Saturdays are meant for brunching and since I moved to Cleveland I have been way busy and have not had the chance to until today and I am so glad I came across this place! I will absolutely be back for several reasons.   - The food is amazing! Although I went for brunch I ended up having things off the lunch menu. I tried the margarita pizza and the Italian baguette because they both sounded great and couldn't make up my mind. The Italian baguete came with fries and if you wanted to get a salad or olives with it instead of the fries you can for 2 dollars more. I likes the baguette but absolutely loved the pizza. I also ordered a mimosa and it was 7 dollars. They serve it with a side of orange juice and a mini bottle of champagne so I literally had two mimosas for 7 dollars which is a great deal !   -The atmosphere and service is wonderful. Our waiter was super nice and when we forgot our leftovers he tried to come after us to give us our boxes (i always forget my leftovers and this is the first time a waiter has done this). Overall, I had a wonderful experience and will definietly be going back. Highly recommend.    -They also sell home made scones and a variety of different sauces, olives, cheeses and even alcohol. It is a little market with a bar and restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow tried this place out last night and it is AMAZING! Started with a bottle of rose ($20 so cheap!) and the cheesemonger board. Then had the veal meatballs, Greek pita nachos, and the French onion soup. All were phenomenal. The meatball with spaghetti is very garlicy so if you don't love garlic I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I made an 8:30 reservation at this restaurant. Upon arrival, we were begrudgingly greeted by a rude host, who seemed irritated that we arrived, letting us know that we wouldn't be seated until the guests at our table for 5 finished and left. After waiting until almost 9pm in the \"market area,\" I walked back up to the host to see how the table with packed food getting ready to leave were doing, and he looked to me asking \"how can I help you,\" (condescendingly). I said I was just checking on the table and we had an 8:30 reservation, noting that their were two empty tables, one open of 4 and another for 2...easily something that could have been combined to accommodate our already late dinner reservation. We immediately left. I was intrigued to try the food based on the menu, I won't be back. Instead, we went to Szechuan Gourmet, easily the best most genuine and least stuffy restaurant in Cleveland. We were not disappointed by our decision."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Astoria Cafe for brunch on my birthday.  I can't say enough great things about this place.  The atmosphere is very pleasant and positive.  Everyone is very friendly, willing to help and offer suggestions on what to order.  They work as a team.  The service was top notch and awesome!  The food was even better.  We started with the calamari and walleye frites.  I could have stopped there.  It was just that good!  The walleye was very fresh and prepared just right.  My husband had the meatball pizza and I had the breakfast short rib and lamb burger.  Everything was very delicious.  The manager gave us a tour of the facility.  That just topped off our dining experience.  I live all the way in Beachwood, Ohio but I will return soon.  I recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"come and graze on the small plates and enjoy exploring wonderful tastes of the Mediterranean ... The boards and small plates rock... never have made it to an entree. Can't say the pizzas are great, just good as I'm personally not a fan of thick crusts. The grilled octopus was transcendent. Good vibe, great service."}
{"text":"Wow. We've been meaning to try this place for months and finally did. I wish we would've gone sooner. We've been missing out on some serious deliciousness!  I had the grilled octopus small plate, my husband had the ravioli and meatballs, and my son had the kids chicken tenders and fries (which I totally snacked on too).  All were outstanding, portions were as expected-good, and the wine was very reasonably priced (our Cab Sauv bottle was $20)  The service was great and decor/atmosphere still felt like we were dining in a restaurant (there's a small Italian market in front). Parking is also super easy. They have a private lot next door. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I honestly wouldn't write home about this place. The food is solid (had a delicious gyro omelette with coffee for brunch) but you will easily pay $20+ a person and you are eating in a grocery store/deli - albeit a cute one. In my opinion, there are spots that are just as savory and cute that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places to eat! Love all of the fresh ingredients, most of them imported from Greece. I enjoyed an appetizer with 4 different cheeses, 3 of them I couldn't even pronounce, but it was amazing. I also enjoyed pizza and a salad. Also delicious. I loved the atmosphere, upscale and trendy. I definitely recommend arriving early or making reservations."}
{"text":"I've been here for a weekday lunch and then weekend brunch. Overall, both the food and the service was way better on the weekend. My parents and I felt practically ignored during lunch even though it was not very busy and the food was fine but nothing special. However at brunch at the bar, we felt attended to and the Mediterranean style dishes were quite tasty. The store part of the market is full of specialty olives, cheeses, spices, etc. A little pricey but worth a look."}
{"text":"I've been to Astoria Cafe & Market twice for brunch, twice for dinner, and a number of times to use the market section of the establishment. This review is based on the collective experience of all my visits. Reservations are recommended especially for weekend dinner.   Overall: highly recommended with some reservation for diners with food allergies as they may not be able to accommodate you.   Service: the wait staff is always wonderful. They are pleasant to engage with, attentive but not pushy/ hovering, and able to provide insightful recommendations on food or drink based on your personal tastes.  I did have one negative experience while seated at the bar - someone in my party sent back chicken to which the chef less than 5 feet away from us responded, \"are you kidding me!\" They remade the food and our server comped the dish, but the reaction of the chef within earshot of the entire party embarrassed the girl who sent back the chicken for being under-cooked.     Ambience: relaxed white tablecloth vibe... that's a thing, right? When you first walk into Astoria you are in the market section. Import goods like olive oil are all around you, a robust selection of wine and beer is to your right, and a deli case full of cheeses and prepared foods are in front of you.   To the left of the market is the restaurant and bar. Servers are dressed upscale casual while patrons range from prom night attire to workout clothes (I've dined in athletic shorts and a T-shirt for brunch after a 5k). Diners run the gamut - families with kids, date night, girl's night out, individuals at the bar. Overall, nice decor with a laid-back atmosphere.   Product: For brunch, I've tried the Brunch Board (a breakfast-y twist on a traditional charcuterie board with quail egg, bacon, breakfast sausage, fruits, and cheeses) and the Duck Confit and Hash. The duck was moist inside with a wonderful crispy crust on the outside. It was served over a bed of fingerling potatoes with two sunny side up eggs. The rich duck, crispy skin, runny eggs, and tender potatoes combined for an exquisite bite. Actually, everything I've eaten at Astoria has been fantastic. The dishes all pop with flavor and contrast - very well composed across the board. The standout dinner menu item that I still remember months later is the octopus alla karvouna - perfectly char-grilled with olive oil, lemon, white wine, and oregano - sublime.      However, those with allergies may want to phone ahead to confirm Astoria's ability to accommodate you. A lactose intolerant member of my brunch party was informed they could not substitute olive oil for butter in any of the eggs dishes which reduced her options to a tofu scramble or a fruit cup for brunch. If I were in her shoes, I would have been disappointed with the options."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place. Excellent execution and even on a a Tuesday night.  Great atmosphere and such great service for the six of us.  Tried too many things to mention.  You are missing out!!!"}
{"text":"I made it here for dinner recently for the first time, and should have gone earlier! It's a fantastic Mediterranean market, with so many different options for food. This is a great spot for a Pescatarian, with plenty of seafood and veggie options. We ordered the pita fries and OMG amazing. I also tried the beet salad, which also was so good.  I also love that it's a market as well, with a wide selection of Italian, Greek and French wines."}
{"text":"This place was a positive surprise! Since I've moved back to Cleveland, I keep finding new restaurants that had popped up, this being one of them. My friend and I decided to try dinner here last night.  Atmosphere: the layout is half grocery store, half restaurant and bar. I didn't explore the store section very much, but did notice a large selection of wines. In the restaurant area, the layout is very open. Tables are close together, and we ended up talking to random, friendly, fellow customers who would come up to our table to ask questions about our dish. It felt kind of like a family dinner. The lighting is quite bright, and there is no music playing here.  Service: warm and efficient. We had several different staff members check up on us, again wth the whole family vibe going on.  Food: this place is good for a person on my diet (vegetarian, gluten free.) there were several dishes I wanted to try, like the gluten free pizza options, the chickpea and spinach stew, and their hummus, but I ended up ordering the black lentil salad. It came with various fruits, vegetables and nuts scattered on the plate. The dish was very interesting. I am still getting used to eating fruits and vegetables together after years of refusing this, so it was a big step for me. While some of the flavors were a bit unusual together for me, my friend adored the dish, saying the blend was perfect. Either way, I finished my dish and ordered flourless chocolate cake for dessert, which was decadent.  Overall, I am excited to come back and try the other dishes. I think I would really enjoy using this as a lunch spot."}
{"text":"Had a great salad. Server was very personable. Chic eatery and love the gourmet food selections."}
{"text":"I discovered this place 3 weeks ago and already have been back 5 times. Today, I had one of the best dishes of my life, Scallop/crab Benedict. It's simply out of this world tasty! The portions are generous, the staff is friendly and it has a homey feel. If I lived closer, I'd eat here every single day. So far, between my husband and I, we've had: margarita pizza, soft crab egg Benedict, lentil salad, a cheese board, lamb egg Benedict, Opera cake and honey lemon cake. Every single dish has been heavenly."}
{"text":"I wandered into Astoria during the cash mob in the section of Gordon district that is affected by the construction on Detroit avenue.  This place is the perfect spot for happy hour with friends or date night with Tinder bae.  I had the calamari and walleye with a spicy aioli dip.  The food was good especially the sauce.  The highlight of my visit was the Ricotta Cheese Tarte w/fresh apricot puree.  I can't really explain it.  It's not cheesecake but also isn't flan.  It has a cheesecake consistency but it is nowhere near as sweet and the puree supplies just enough sweetness.  I recommend the dessert but it also will be an acquired taste so if you are resting all your dessert dreams on it and are the least bit unsure I suggest going with a safer option.  I will definitely return to Astoria to try more off the menu and do some shopping in the interesting marketplace."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great food, Awesome atmosphere, and the staff is phenomenal. Expected something way different, but was extremely happy with the surprise. Take the recommendations from the staff and you won't be disappointed. A new favorite for me."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour.  Great vegan pizza with mushrooms and tomatoes. Best anywhere.  They offer vegan options for brunch, lunch and dinner. Also, they make many menu items as vegan. ."}
{"text":"4 for 4. Every time as good as the last. Pizza, meatballs, hummus, and Greek salad sandwich all so good. Our new favorite Friday feast"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been mentioned? The food and service were phenom. The ONLY THING holding me back from a 5 star review was the flies. Seriously. We killed at least three while waiting for our breakfast and gave up after that. Maybe it was a seasonal thing, and I'm going to assume that. Going back will be easy: one of the best breakfasts I've had in CLE! Fresh toast? Amazing! Coffee? Wow! Breakfast flatbread? Holy smokes!"}
{"text":"Super impressed with this place. Plan to try everything in their menu what a great place for everything. Cheese plates, small plates wines specialty drinks. A market what else could you possibly want. So we love Astoria NY and this Astoria cafe and market reminds us of NY. This place is awesome"}
{"text":"The food here was great!  We started with the \"not all happy cows come from California\" cheese plate.  Will crave the blue-veined Stilton.  Then we shared 4 small plates.  Everything was good, but the grilled watermelon with feta was incredible.  Service was great.  The \"cheese steward\" really knew his stuff and our waiter was friendly and efficient.    I loved the market atmosphere.  Reminded me of a mini-Mediterranean \"Eataly\"."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, service, and wine selection. The seafood is extraordinary. I had probably one of the best prepared, succulent calamari dishes topped with their famous \"roe\" which enhances the flavor profile of a lot of their dishes. The soulvaki is tender and flavorful. The pizzas are balanced with amazing crust.  Overall great experience - would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I loved eating, drinking and shopping here! I also love it so much because I can walk here.  (((Praying that they get an espresso machine and really good locally roasted beans and hire a really good barista that loves coffee soooo much)))"}
{"text":"The best new restaurant in Cleveland, as voted on by Scene magazine readers, and also the location of our wedding rehearsal dinner.  We selected Astoria based on...well...having availability for our day and not asking to sign a contract to hand over our first born (read: Market Garden).  To be honest, it was by chance.  We were down the street and after saying no to an event space that wasn't wheelchair accessible, we were down to our last options.  I pulled up Yelp, fired off a search, and landed on Astoria.  We drove down, got shown around by one of the owners, and immediately signed up.  Astoria is a home run for ambiance.  It's half market, half bar, err half restaurant.  They do it all very well.  They do it all perfectly.  On our date night, we sample the cheese board, did the dip sampler, and split the lamb, veal, and ricotta meatballs.  And guess what, we basically did it all over again for the reception, except we added chicken marsala and a couple salads.  Everything was plentiful, perfect, and staffed accordingly.  One little hiccup in our plans.  We originally deleted the tasting room based on the size of our guest.  The city shut down the tasting room 1 week BEFORE OUR WEDDING.  Whoops.  Cherie called me immediately and followed up with a voicemail.  She offered to move it to the front of the restaurant or even to move it to her building and for Astoria to cater it.  We chose to have it in the front of Astoria, and took up 3/4 of the restaurant.  Good news: they expect to have the tasting room and a patio ready to go in 5 weeks from this review, unfortunately 5 weeks too late.  I have to thank Astoria for making the best of the situation and accommodating my wife, me, and our 40 guests.  Astoria could not have been better for our date night, and could not have been better for our rehearsal dinner.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Got the octopus and a pizza and both were excellent. Come here on a Saturday night and ask the serve to walk you through the menu for some fan favorites. You'll leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place is part market and part cafe. I tried the cafe for brunch. It was pretty busy around 11 on Sunday. The cafe area is seat yourself, but the server that attended to us was friendly and attentive.   I tried the Croque Madame. It was a large serving and the menu said the bread was made fresh daily. It was served with a Sunny-Side Up Egg and one side: house made Chorizo sausage links, Bacon or  Potato Hash.  I enjoyed the sausage and also got to try the hash. It wasn't really has. It was not mixed with anything. But the potatoes, really tiny cubes, were crispy and good.   The cocktail menu also sounded stellar. The Fig Julip and the Eoos were good and the Bloody Mary was spicy and served with chopped olives and two whole unstuffed olives.   This place takes up a large portion of the street front on Detroit and makes a nice end cap to the currently developed part of the Gordon Square neighborhood. (It happens to be by my favorite Vietnamese and Indian restaurants). Street parking is free."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's become a weekend go to for my boyfriend and I. Their brunch was a little hectic, but lunch or dinner time is more of a laid back atmosphere to enjoy and appreciate the food and a good glass of wine. Everything on their menu has been phenomenal, I honestly can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Astoria is agreeably my new favorite lunch and drink spot on the near West Side of Cleveland.  They have a great selection of cheese boards and small plates but dont let small plates scare you away because their pizza is amazing, and if your a first timer you have to try the Pizza Prosciutto Crude e Rucla."}
{"text":"I'd give Astoria 5 stars for the service alone! I went on a weekday with two friends and we asked Trent, the bartender for some recommendations. He spent so much time with us understanding our tastes and coming up with tailored drink recommendations. Our server was also great!  For starters we ordered the Grilled Halloumi and Baked Brie en Croute. We ended up in a cheese coma after this dairy overload but they were both fantastic. The baked brie was so rich and deliciously gooey. The thyme and fig jam were a great complement to the strong brie flavor!  As if I didn't have enough cheese already, I ordered the Spring Salad with Burrata for my main. I don't know how they made a simple salad taste so good, but it was so fresh and dressed perfectly.   They bring out a few types of bread to start and the warm focaccia is amazing with melt in your mouth flavors.  Can't wait to keep going back!"}
{"text":"chill, friendly staff amazing seafood options (scallops were out of this world) remarkably inexpensive wine options spacious layout with a cool high/low balance of market/deli counters and gorgeous dining area"}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite brunch spot (and once I try dinner, I'm assuming it'll be a favorite then too). I got a scallop and crab eggs benedict. The scallops were HUGE, and the flavor of everything was delicious. I also tried the figgy old fashioned. It was an amazing cocktail. I plan to go again, and to go often."}
{"text":"Had the one of the best meals of my life at Astoria last weekend! First of all, our waiter who I believe was the manager was so incredibly nice and friendly. The food is just so good here! I mean it's authentic and flavorful and just really good! I got the meatballs and my boyfriend got the chicken and we both loved our meals. We also got the zucchini blossoms + olive trio to start and boy oh boy they were sooo yummy! I highly recommend Astoria and I cannot wait to return. The only downside was that everything on the menu sounded amazing so it was hard to pick"}
{"text":"Well, color me impressed! We had an absolutely wonderful brunch at Astoria recently. Bottomless cups of strong, well-balanced coffee, attentive service, and some standout dishes:  - Breakfast pizza - to die for! - Lemon Quinoa pancakes - gluten-free!  - Tortilla Española - SCRUMPTIOUS! Light, creamy, decadent.  As a bonus, after lingering over our empty plates, we enjoyed trolling the cheese case and specialty market.   If you're looking for a fresh and well-executed brunch, consider making Astoria your next stop!"}
{"text":"The food and the service was superb... a must visit!  We also met George the owner, he was very helpful  explaining all of the different types of cheeses and the regions as well as all the pairings.   We will be back highly recommend!"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way around! The menu is incredible with options for Gluten Free, Vegetarian, and Vegan there is something for EVERYONE! I love the selection of wine in the market and the fact that you can purchase a bottle and drink it at your table is fantastic! I started off with one of their many charcuterie boards followed by the Greek salad, super fresh! There were so many choices for dinner my friends and I couldn't decide! We each got a small plate and shared! With the relaxing cafe atmosphere our family style dinner was perfect. The octopus was amazing as well as the lamb, duck, and oysters! Yes, we got it all! The service was equally amazing! Our server was kind to guide us through the menu and always one step ahead with everything we needed! Thanks Astoria I will be back!"}
{"text":"I braved a cold snowy Cleveland night to meet up with the supper club.  I enjoyed the Lentil Bowl (Black Lentil Bowl - $12 Black Lentils Topped with Roasted Beets, Steamed Broccoli, Orange Segments, Pomegranate Seeds, Toasted Almonds, Mozzarella, and Radicchio. Drizzled with Honey and EVOO.  I felt like I was eating a healthy sunshine bowl of health!  Almost every color in the rainbow was represented and everything was fresh.  If I get a chance to come back, I would probably skip the lentil bowl.  Let me tell you I had some serious pizza envy happening as I scoped out the other supper clubbers choices.  The pizza, shrimp and bisque is what had my mouth watering.  Oh well, there is always next time."}
{"text":"I had a chance to go to two new places today - out and about a lot today - and this was one of them.  I went with my mom, who had been there before with my sister.  They both raved about it, so we were in the area and went.  I had gazpacho - different than any I ever had, as it was pureed, but it was really good and flavorful.  My mom had the potato soup, which she could not say enough about.  And we shared hummus - really good flavor and texture, and it comes with warm pita.    The waiter was really friendly and remembered my mom from when she was in earlier in the week.  Lovely lunch!"}
{"text":"Pita fries, cheeses, wine oh my!  Great service and unique and great tasting food. Great for meeting people for lunch or hanging out for a drink in the evening."}
