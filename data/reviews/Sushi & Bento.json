{"text":"I was sooo looking forward to nice fresh sashimi dinner tonight.. After spending $18 (!!) and getting home, I opened the take out box and discovered tiniest pieces of fish I've ever seen. Moreover, salmon looked like it was laying on the counter for the whole day. The fish was definitely NOT fresh and salmon smelled too. I had to throw out half of the dinner... So much to eating at that place..."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and not for ayce.  The tea was horrible, it was just tainted hot water. The salad tasted weird and the dressing was bad.  

The butterfish fish was cold and you can tell it was defrosted. 

The salmon sashimi was decent. 

For the price, I would definitely not come back again.  Like seriously, how can you mess up tea?!!"}
{"text":"Popped by a few times for lunch and once for dinner. Decent sushi;  right ratio of rice and fish. Didn't try the sashimi, so not sure if the fish is super fresh but worth a shot if you're in the neighbourhood for lunch (lunch deals are pretty sweet, esp the bento boxes). Service is very friendly. 

Be warned that both my friend and I got sick once from having sushi here. Returned recently and I was fine.  Its probably a one time thing."}
{"text":"This is my fav sushi ayce place in the neighbourhood (i really disagree with the restaurant's current rating!) they offer torched items, super dragon is really good!"}
{"text":"Was here for AYCE dinner on a Friday night, but did not enjoy it at all - will never come back again. It just seemed like they didn't want to serve us sashimi. 

We had 2 people. In the first round, we ordered 40 pieces of salmon sashimi, and they came the last - after all the other food was served. We got less than 30 pieces, but I think that is understandable. Then in the second round, we ordered 50 pieces and only a few other kitchen items, knowing the amount of what we ordered would be reduced anyway. Took about 10-15 minutes, and they served 28 pieces, which is less than half of what we ordered. Immediately, we ordered another 30 pieces, but they never came, so we left after waiting for almost half hour for those 30 pieces of salmon sashimi. Plus, their sashimi is very small and thin, which is why we ordered so much. Also, even though it was a Friday night, it wasn't very busy so I don't understand what took them so long. 

Food was okay, but I guess I probably shouldn't have come here for AYCE."}
{"text":"Another mediocre sushi place in downtown Toronto.  The difference is that Sushi and Bento actually gets some things right, therefore in my books it should get a 3 star.  

The good:  Surprisingly fresh tempura.  Generous maki rolls and sashimi  slices.  Cold glass noodles - not the best I've had, but a nice treat nonetheless.  Decent prices.  

The bad:  Nigiri suffered from the usual problem of too much packed too hard and thin slices of fish.  Dishes arrived unevenly so that even though  my partner and I each ordered a bento, mine arrived a full 10 minutes earlier.

The pros make it a good enough place to go again for a quick lunch on a business day.  Get the sushi rolls - they are worth it and surprisingly good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for good priced sushi.  The food is always really good and the prices are amazing.  
The people are so friendly and always give me free miso soup while I wait if I'm getting take out.  
Spicy tuna is 5 star.  
I moved from this area, but I always get take out when I'm close by!!"}
{"text":"Some of the dishes didnt get served. I asked for the menu and the server told me finished what i have otherwise i will get charged for the waste. If i couldnt finish thats my problem, but you didnt serve me the dishes!  .....I asked for the bill and told her the chicken cutlet and teriyaki in the sushi roll are over cooked caused the middle part hard to chew. She had no reply nothing so i asked if she is listened and she just nud her head. Dont go there if you ever have another choice.   I would never back again even its the only restaurant in the planet."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favourite sushi places to eat at but I guess the original owners sold it and have moved on.  Sushi bento now has only one server who is super rude and clearly thinks she is too good for her job.  My sister and I did the lunch ayce option and despite the fact that it was Thursday at 3pm and we were the only patrons...service was slow, the server kept giving us dirty looks and told us she would charge us for ordering more if we couldn't finish what was on our table before ordering .  We wanted to order in advance while eating since it took so long for the food to come the first time. At exactly 4pm when my sister was finishing up and requested another dessert... She was told no because the special was over.  I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Last time we went to sushi and bento , they have all you can  eat , only 19.99.they have torch sushi .they use fire to torch sushi .we never had before .sushi is very good ,spice dragon roll is excellent,I think the sushi roll is the best in the area , we will come back again?"}
{"text":"This place had reasonably good sushi for the price. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento and it came quick. The staff were patient and helpful when we were ordering and paying the bill. Not gonna lie, my friend and I thought that one of the waiters was friggen cute. lolololol"}
{"text":"Came here for ayce at lunch on a Saturday. Price is the same as most places (12.99$) but it's one of the worst ayce I've been to. 

They're really stingy on fish in nigiris and rolls, a lot of rice in everything. 

Selection is really small, no eel.

Some items from our order just got forgotten 

Service is slow and diners who order from the Ã  la carte menu are prioritized.

Not a good experience, don't eat here."}
{"text":"So we were in the area for sushi to celebrate my sister's belated birthday and stumbled upon this restaurant. 

Thought it'd be nice for a change, soon after we had tons of regrets. After placing a order for the AYCE menu, we waited 15-27mins before the food arrived, and this was only 2 items we had on our list. We were crazy hungry so we just ate it, but the order of salmon rose was horrible, it had such a bad taste with too much rice and they forgot to bring wasabi and ginger which is kinda standard. 

When more food came rolling in we noticed many items were forgotten and when asked they told us to reorder, which is kinda baffling. The time when the sashimi of white tuna, red snapper, surfing clam came around , the colour which should be white had a brownish tan to it, and tasted awful as expected. One other noticeable dish was the spicy chicken in the kitchen section of the menu, do not order this,  as it tasted like chewy deep fried chicken covered in water down Sriracha with lemon juice poured on top, completely awful. Hand roll's seaweed are also chewy and not crispy and smaller size than usual. Seriously the only highlights were the sashimi salmon and avocado salads we ordered and those are really small portions. 

Avoid this place if you can, half way through I felt like barfing."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times for lunch. It's one of those indistinguishable Japanese sushi places with more or less the same things on the menu. Fast, cheap, and sushi!

Express lunch takeout is by far my first choice. You can select two rolls and a drink for $7.90 cash, can't beat that price. Selections include the standard fare - spicy salmon, spicy tuna, california, etc.

All you can eat - I don't really know how to comment on this because cheap and good don't usually go together.

The general lunch menu has an assortment of maki rolls, sashimis and bento boxes. The key selling point for this place is Torch sushi. Try it!

Tip: I find the rolls kindof dry, so ask for extra ginger or soya sauce as you see fit."}
{"text":"I had always passed this place by - that is until I went to a house party where they catered and came away truly impressed! The next week, I stopped by this little spot, twice. 

The space is small and cozy, and the family (?) running the joint is friendly and attentive. While prices here are a smidge higher than what you'll find on Fast-Food-Sushi Row (aka Bloor), the value of what you get is bonanzas. On my first visit, solo, I opted for a bento box dinner that included soup, salad, salmon teriyaki, cold glass noodles, rice, some fried balls of some sort, and a satisfying amount of sushi, all for about 16 bucks. It was the perfect combo of a-little-bit-of-everything, and the sushi was stellar. They even brought me an extra bowl of miso soup! Unnecessary, but I think it was just another sign of their courteous service. 

The second time around I brought two friends and my only other note is that you must go for their rolls. They are massive, fresh, and positively delicious. Anything that comes with \"crispy bits\" is a surefire winner. Really. We ended up sitting around till closing, and they also treated us to complimentary ice cream (not usually on the house here, as in some other sushi spots) - red bean or green tea - as we wound down.

Someone once told me that this place had the best sushi in the city. It's a hefty statement and maybe not one I'd be ready to back, but I can say that Sushi & Bento definitely has enough going for it to earn many more return visits."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi with excellent service. The server offered many things on the house for us to try. They also were very quick with the food and happy to make more if you wanted it. I had shrimp maki and my partner had the chicken teriyaki, we were both very pleased with our meals. We also shared kimchi and edamame which were seasoned perfectly. I would highly recommend this place to people looking for a casual evening with great food. We left happy and full."}
{"text":"Very slow, some order culling/missed orders for large sashimi, especially annoying when dining with large groups.


Quality of food is alright, typical of cheaper Toronto sushi restaurants. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect it, but one of the better AYCE places. 

1. Fish to rice ratio - generally on point.
2. Torched rolls - a nice find not available at most AYCE restaurants and pretty well done.
3. Kitchen items - generally pretty good! The ribs weren't 90% gristle as you might usually find. 
4. $10 12oz warm sake - because it's freezing now, right?"}
{"text":"I'm no sushi expert but this place isn't worth the visit. Stopped in for lunch today with my wife and we ordered a sushi boat for two and an 8pcs torched sushi. Everything came to approximately $45 with tax and tips, price was amazing. Food however is a whole different story. The Maki rolls were huge but the rice was soggy and no vinegar taste at all, the center was mostly cucumber and tempura flakes with 1 piece of kani inside for the roll. The torched sushi was horrible, again soggy rice with no vinegar and this time the  rice was hot with cold fish and the top was torched. The sashimi was cool almost room temperature which we weren't too happy with. Small dining area maybe seats about 50 people. Wouldn't go again sorry but the fish shouldn't be room temperature and soggy rice."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  I've been a handful of times for an average sushi experience, ok for lunch.  However, this time I got the usual spicy ramen & sushi combo and the spice or something kept choking me.  It wasn't too spicey for me, it just kept choking me like pepper or something. I basically had water for my meal to clear my throat.
So I returned it and one of the owners, this fairly taller man with a straight face kept yelling at me.  He wouldnt stop and continued to yell.  I couldnt believe their behaviour and reaction to a customer. It was absolutely unacceptable and I will not return or refer anyone there.
Not to mention they are way too slow, that's always been the case."}
{"text":"I had the Pork cutlet bento box, and it was pretty great. The service was really good, but it was slow a little bit due to the number of staff. They were very accommodating."}
{"text":"Most disgusting sushi I ever had in my life... don't trust the reviews it's even more worst ..... had the lunch buffet the sushi was over stuffed with rice .... the service was very bad didn't come and give the order sheet for the sushi.... never again please save ur money and go to a better place if I could I would give 0 stars"}
{"text":"We came here based on the yelp reviews, and boy were they right. The owners were super friendly, the food was excellent, and a great value. My wife and son got bento boxes, which were loaded. I got the sushi, which was well prepared, and delicious. Definitely a place we will come back to when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Very clean inside and good sushi. They had very kind and polite servers."}
{"text":"Popped in here for lunch this week with a coworker and was quite pleased with the overall experience. They have both a small lunch menu (which still has tons of options) and a bigger menu for all the time that had too many options for a quick lunch. 

We both went with Bento boxes and were impressed with the tasty food and quick service. The glass noodles were delicious and the California rolls tasty. The teriyaki chicken was dark meat rather than white. It was just full of flavour.

We were very pleased with the overall experience and if we're in the area again, I think I'd push to go back."}
{"text":"Really this is 3 and 1/2 stars, but I'm rounding up for the taste of the mayo-laden spicy salmon rolls.  
For cheap sushi lunch near Dundas and University, head to Sushi and Bento. I've been here plenty of times and always get the same thing- lunch special #12. It comes with cold glass noodles made from sweet potatoes that I only eat if I have room, spicy salmon roll, california roll, and salad.  Up in the top left corner there is another 4 pieces of a roll that took me three tries to identify as sweet potato roll with tempura bits mixed in.  It's delicious with the sweet eel sauce, too. And of course a little of that japanese salad.  
Now on my low carb diet, I got #8 lunch special. For $12, I got what seemed like a pound of sashimi- the most delicious tuna and yellow tail, ebi sushi and a lot of salmon (which probably is too high in fat for the diet, but soooo good!)"}
{"text":"My family's favorite new place for sushi! The new owners are very kind, truly nice people. The sushi is fantastic and reasonably priced. Try the Special dragon roll!!!"}
{"text":"Service very bad. Food very bad . Get alot rice in sushi and vinegary in rice , teriyaki very bad to . And i never comeback."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else, I can vouch that their complaints are still valid. Just went today and they still have ill mannered servers, slow service, and cheap quality sushi, which tends to be mushy and dry because it has wayyyyy too much rice. 

The long detailed review, if you care to read more is: 

The service is bad, as servers are rude. Just after the first round of sushi we ordered more but they rejected us because you have to finish EVERY SINGLE PIECE of sushi on your plate (which was like 4 maki pieces). The server even eyed me and told me to stop picking at my rice and fish or he will not bring me more food. The audacity he had to say that to a customer, and not even in a polite manner. If I have leftovers then yes I will pay for it, but what right do you have to refuse me food I am paying for. When I finished my food on the table I even had to prompt him to remind him to give the rest of the food we ordered. 

At the beginning when we sat down I even had to prompt the server to bring us the AYCE menu. When we said AYCE we assumed they would bring the menu so we could start, but 10 mins later with no service I got the clue that I had to ask. I guess they don't think initiative and customer service is essential. They should really retrain their employees if all the Yelp reviewers have the same problem, which is a big indication that it's a problem. Not to mention there were only 2 other diners (groups of 2) when we were there, so not busy at all. Had to prompt them to bring soy sauce too (is that not a sushi staple!?) 

On to the food: way too much rice in the rolls, hence it tastes very dry. Sushi is supposed to be bite sized, but there are just abnormally big. And not a large variety of food. Dynamite rolls are all the same California rolls with different \"toppings\" (salmon on Cali, avocado on Cali, sauce on Cali). One thing that's tricky is you order tempura by number of pieces, so for shrimp tempura which is corrected with white out on top of the veg tempura option. I assumed it is only shrimp as it's corrected. But it turns out that it is not a correction but an addition, so for ONE piece of shrimp you get 3 huge pieces of yam and broccoli.

Quality food and QUALITY SERVICE  makes a good quality restaurant. Lacking in both that the relatively cheap price ($14 lunch) does not make up for it. For cheap sushi it's pretty decent but the bad service leaves a bad after taste personally."}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout, we love it! Had beef yaki udon, spicy scallop roll, 18 pieces sashimi. They all taste great, we used to order yaki udon from bonsai and thought they make it better than shinsei, but now I think we have a new fav place to get our yaki udon fix. Especially they have such great value on sashimi :18 pieces for $20. I see no reason to go elsewhere for sushi cravings. Looking foreword to eating at sushi bar soon!!"}
{"text":"Easy to miss this strip mall location, but well worth the effort. We were in a hurry, so we just ordered the spicy pork bowls. They had rice, sauteed pork, green and white onions, julienned carrots, and a spicy red sauce with just the right amount of heat. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place has gained popularity and is $1/bite when ordering off the menu. Just keep that in mind. Boys ordered 2 rolls each ~$14/person *nothing fancy* and they wanted MORE (we went home and made burgers to fill them up). 

If you're not big on sushi and/or hungry, I still recommend sticking with the chicken bento box. *good variety of flavors and textures and it comes with a small salad\" The beef still tends to be quite squeaky, but covered in it's tasty house sauce is delish.

The food is Fresh and High Quality! The \"to-go\" traffic was noticeable. The sit down ordering was busier than usual, but in a good way! I am happy to see that business is picking up. This place is high quality without the muss/fuss *BIG Smiles*"}
{"text":"Brutal - not a lot of variety. Went for the $20 dinner buffet. Went in since they were advertising crab legs. The crab legs was frozen and not all you can eat. The sushi had ice chunks and the servers were inexpressive. We ordered 10 surf clams for two people twice and got 5 each time. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Decent food. But comparisons with the nearby Kyoto House restaurant (also ayce) must be made.

Came here for ayce lunch on sunday. It seems like the portion sizes here are too huge for an ayce place. For ayce place, this is a bad thing because meaning it's easy to over order and gives you less opportunity to sample other things. Kyoto House gives me the feeling that they keep each portion as small as possible so you don't accidentally over order (which is good, IMO).

For example, the salmon roll at Kyoto House is 6 small rolls with just salmon, rice, and seaweed that is good enough for a sample. Or if you order more, it won't fill you so you can't try something else still. The salmon roll at Sushi Bento is packed with salmon, avocado, and lots of rice, which is twice the size of Kyoto house's.

The outside of the restaurant entices you with tempura shrimp all you can eat for lunch, which Kyoto House doesn't have for lunch. But when you get to see the ayce menu, you'll find that one order is for 1 tempura shrimp AND 3 pieces of veggie tempura, which was 1 BIG piece of broccoli and 2 yam tempura.  The broccoli tempura was so huge, the centre wasn't fried properly and the batter was still kinda raw or soggy. Needless to say, I didn't order any more shrimp tempura. The yam tempura was okay size.

I'm always quite careful when ordering things at ayce restaurants so I don't over order. I ordered quite conservatively and I was planning to order different stuff for round 2, but the portions in round 1 was so huge, not only could I not order round 2, I was struggling to finish round 1. I was ordering like I would at Kyoto house and it's like I'm getting twice the portion sizes here at Sushi Bento.

The menu for lunch seems smaller than that of Kyoto House. Kyoto House has a slightly better menu for my tastes (with calamari tempura). Sushi Bento has a fire dragon torched sushi (8 pieces), which I didn't dare to order cuz I didn't know if 8 pieces would be too much. Seeing the portion size of other things, I suspect that the 8 pieces could be my whole meal.

The services were really good. The lady was very kind and professional.

I don't think I'd be back again. I was out of lunch ideas for work and the tempura shrimp in front of the restaurant got me to go inside. Fool me once... Lol.

Quality: 5/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 5/10. Overall: 5/10."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi ever! Been coming for years, always fresh sushi and all around good"}
{"text":"Had to eat here three times before I could be sure, but this is hands down my favorite sushi in The Valley. The rolls are gorgeous, fresh, reasonably priced and the owners are very friendly and gracious. Chef/owner Brian Kim was a sushi chef in LA and Seattle before setting here in the valley with his wife, and his food is fresh and creative. Highly recommend! BEST firecracker I have ever eaten. Best ramen in the valley. Great inexpensive meat/rice bowls for lunch (5.95). Love it and excited to have an awesome place to eat in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in yesterday (it was my birthday).  He was very hungry and so he decided to go for the All-you-can-eat dinner and we're told it's $19.99. I'm not hungry but I figured it would be okay if I had one or two or three pieces of my husband's dinner. After we ate, the nice waitress handed us a bill for $45. For 2 dishes of sushi.  I said there must be some mistake, my husband was the only one who ordered food but she insisted that since I also ate that we both had \"All-you-can-eat\".  So, by their logic because I helped him finish the last 4 pieces on the plate because they don't give out take-out containers, we had to pay $45.  Make sense?   Make sure you take a pass on these rip off artists and thieves. No way I could ever recommend this place to anyone. TOTAL RIP OFF."}
{"text":"So lucky to have found this place! Love the sushi and teriyaki chicken. My only critic was the tempura vegetables were a little over breaded bit that's just a personal preference."}
{"text":"Walked in on a whim tonight. While we were waiting to order we skimmed some reviews (which seem at either end of the spectrum). We didn't want or have time for AYCE, so I ordered the Valentine roll ($11) and salmon sashimi ($4) and my partner ordered the chicken tereyaki bento box ($13) and added on the salmon sushi and sashimi (2 pieces each and I believe for $2 more).

I found the service to be quick and efficient. My roll was large, in size and quantity (10 pieces). The pieces were shaped like hearts! But the best deal was the bento box. Chicken tereyaki, rice, dumplings, veggie tempura, spicy salmon roll and the add of for $15. Seriously that's a lot of food!! I found the taste of the spicy salmon roll was okay but the valentine was really yummy. Honestly, not sure why it has so many polarizing reviews but I would come back if I were in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch takeout. 

Place was packed with lunch crowd. I ordered spicy salmon & California maki combo lunch special. It literally took only 3 minutes to get my food. Food came in a bento container with 3 side dishes (tiny salad, japchae and yam maki). Spicy salmon had tempura bits and it was quite spicy for my taste. Sushi was kind of warm. I was full from all the rice. 

Not the best sushi in downtown Toronto. If you are looking for a cheap and quick sushi place in downtown Toronto then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE HORRIBLE FOOD. I would rate this place 0 if I have the option. WORST ayce place!  This is my first review on restaurant ever. THIS PLACE IS SO BAD. I have to share my experience. Just went to the place with a friend for ayce. Half of our order get dropped. We ordered 6 pieces of ribs, only 2 came and one of them is just pure fat. Same as sashimi, they give u half of what you ordered. They bring the food to you very slow the restaurant was empty when we were there. According to them they want to see you finish one plate before they bring you another plate.  Their sushi has a lot of rice and their kitchen stuff is over fried to a point that you can't even bite into it. When you complain to them or ask to speak to the manager they dont do anything abt it. The owner just hides in the back. Their fish quality is very bad too. We spent 50 dollars for the two of us and it was not worth the money.  It was definitely not ayce service. We stayed for an hour and got very little food. At the end we got fed up and didn't even get dessert.  I would NEVER GO BACK again."}
{"text":"I will likely never visit again. There was hair in my salad! When I complained the waitress just asked if I want another salad while simultaneously talking with another customer! Nevertheless my appetite was ruined.

Food was meh I had the torch maki fire dragon. No, I'm not biased by the hair salad. 

They were lucky I tipped. 

Don't be fooled - just because seats were fairly filled during lunch hour does not mean this place is good. 

Had to wash it down with a Tsujiri soft cream."}
{"text":"Worth the stop. New owners ...new decor....! Lovely little sushi bento place. Loved the fact that my Oregon role had more fish than rice. Phoenix finally has a legit sushi restaurant!!!!! I see a bright future for this place!"}
{"text":"Sushi & Bento has a really good miso ramen. The interior is bright & clean. Prices are very reasonable. It's so nice to see another great establishment in Phoenix. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm looking for a good sushi restaurant in downtown.
We found Torch Sushi & Bento on Dundas St. West. 
The sushi was amazing, great fish, fresh and very tasty."}
{"text":"This is the new must stop and eat in Phoenix  the sashimi besides not being so expensive it is extremely delicious the bento a perfect amount and prices are great they also have lunch specials always a plus .will definitely come back you guys must try!"}
{"text":"Do not go here! I came here for an AYCE sushi dinner for around $20, and it was NOT worth my money or my time. The service is absolutely horrendous and I have no intention of ever coming back. There are so many other places down the street you can go to if you're looking for sushi in this area.

There was only one server working for all of the tables. She barely spoke to us, and when she did, she was extremely rude in her tone. It is AYCE, so we ordered 20 pieces of salmon sashimi along with other things. It was a reasonable amount of food for the two of us, nothing too drastic. When the food came out, there were a lot less than 20 pieces, which didn't bother us because we figured that when we finished, we would just order more. However, after devouring the sashimi with the craving for more, we kindly asked for a few more pieces since she didn't get the number right the first time anyway. 

Her reaction? A quiet blank stare that awkwardly walked away without saying anything. It left us assuming that she would be bringing it. After waiting for quite some time, we ask again, only to realize she never planned to bring anything out in the first place! She rudely told us she cannot and will not bring any more sashimi out unless we finish the other items on our table because her boss said she can't. Why couldn't she have told us this the first time we asked instead of ignoring us?!

Anyway, this was upsetting because it is an AYCE restaurant after all... And there wasn't even that much on our table. There were a few small dishes that we knew we could finish. We just really wanted to eat the sashimi that we never got! Yet she (with her terrible attitude) refused to bring anything we asked for out until we were done, constantly telling us that we had to finish all of our food. And this was only our first round of orders! Where she didn't even come close to bringing everything we wanted!

The food was OK but not that great. Perhaps the service has affected my judgement. 1 star - Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for the all you can eat dinner today. The all you can eat per person is $19.99 before tax and tips. The service here was good and the seating was comfortable. I didn't feel cramped. So far this is the only all you can eat place that offers Torched maki rolls on their all you eat menu. The food quality here is very good. I would for sure come back."}

{"text":"Don't let the size or location fool you...... the service is always friendly and quick..... I have had about 1/4 of the rolls they offer (and always get the potstickers) and have never been disappointed..... Super happy to have them as neighbors.... makes deciding what to have for dinner super easy....can easily recommend them"}
{"text":"New little place in Phoenix. Been there twice now and the food and pricing have been great both times. Brian, a transplant from Seattle, has years experience in sushi making, and you can tell. Shu is a wonderful woman who always has a smile whenever I see her. Their prices are awesome! Most of the rolls are less than 10 bucks! I'll keep coming here for the great food, good pricing, and great service."}
{"text":"Shit sushi, shit service. I won't come back here again. They always try to make a quick buck off of you for anything they can and leave you waiting for no reason"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places in the neighborhood, but now it is under new management and they have ruined it, for now.  Hopefully not forever. 

My last experience was brutal. I waited 30 mins for a bento box and then asked the server if I could have a miso soup while I continued to wait...and then she charged me for it. This offended me so I left no tip and now offer this story as a warning to future patrons."}
{"text":"So I tried this location out. I went to the lunch ayce. The experience started out okay. Food was warm and not hot but that's fine I can handle that.

What I couldn't handle is the .... Dust (?) On the sushi. It was very off..... The fire dragon (torched sushi roll) was very unpleasant. The sauce on top tasted sour and not okay at all. And was overfilled with rice. It didnt taste right.

The server cared at all. She just was like \"yeah you can't waste food \" 

Which I mean understandable but that is going to make someone sick.

Yeah I really don't recommend this place and I don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Tempura and Teriyaki bento is my regular lunch. Good food for the price."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my food! 
The service was quick, the quantity was more than average sushi bars in the neighbourhood, and great quality too! They had some fusion rolls that had unique flavour and texture from other places. 
My only remark is that the pieces were cut a little bit big."}
{"text":"Just a random stop as we were looking for some food to eat, I would say it's was pretty good, service was so so, but food was pretty good for the price, presentation was nice.  everything seem very fresh. Would come
Back again,"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff!  Small quaint atmosphere.  The spicy pork is really good.  A bit pricey for the whole family, but we all left happy and full."}
{"text":"Decent cheap AYCE sushi for $20 per person (even on weekend nights!). 

But since you gotta order it from the server and the service is less than adequate, it's not the best place I would go to for GOOD AYCE.

Food: There's sashimi and blow torched sushi which is a plus. The quality is pretty average or less I would say. The rest of the selection is mediocre as well. 

Personally, I think if the servers cheered up a bit more and improved their service, I would actually WANT to come here again."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times before but this time, the service was meh, their service got super slow when the place got busier. My friends and I did ayce and some food did not come. The sticky sushi rice was very vinegary and we did not like it at all. Some of the sushi roll were chunky and sloppy. I've had better sushi elsewhere, so I may or may not come back."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. 

Best sushi and Korean food in southern oregon and it's in my small town. 

Kim chi 
Sushi
Wonderful service 

Even on the salads they use high quality food not the terrible lettuce with the shredded carrots. 

I love this place."}
{"text":"It's not a good sign when you want to warn the people coming in to the restaurant as you are leaving that they should turn around and go somewhere else. I restrained myself, but I can warn you. Don't go. I got a Bento Box with maki rolls. The Miso soup was salty. I've never had awful Miso soup before. I didn't even know it was possible! The salad dressing was gross. I couldn't even finish my salad. The maki rolls were mushy and tasteless. The avocado was brown. The shrimp tempura was stale. My table was by the window, so I got to share it with several flies. The whole restaurant looked like it could use a good wipe-down with a bleach soaked rag. I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Super affordable for students and simply the best place to get sushi takeout.

The takeout express special is well-priced at $6.99 for two rolls and a can of pop. The place also offers all you can eat sushi which I have yet to try. Each roll comes in 6 pieces, except for the dynamite roll, which comes in 5 pieces. 

The spicy salmon is just phenomenal! The sauce that is drizzled on the rolls is bursting with flavour and it is not necessarily spicy, but you can definitely feel a tingling sensation.


The dynamite pieces were a bit thin compared to the spicy salmon, making them easier to eat. The dynamite roll simply tastes delicious and is indescribable. The rolls will keep you full for hours. For a place that is located in the core of downtown, Sushi and Bento is the go-to place for lunch."}
{"text":"Small little restaurant found near Centre and Dundas. Great place just to have a one-on-one with a friend over lunch and dinner. Had an amazing bento box for dinner (~$20) filled with sushi, sashimi, tempura, miso soup and salad. Was definitely filling, and it was great sushi."}
{"text":"Not sure why the bad reviews but i have only been once. I ordered the yam avo rollx2 they're great and warm but they're HUGE
The place isn't very nice so i wouldnt eat there but everything else is fine..."}
{"text":"Quaint little sushi shoppe in the midst of the rest in the downtown core; reminds me of a scene out of a movie. Dragon roll is awesome!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this restaurant we decided to check it out. We started with the combination tempura. For being the only people in there I would think the tempura would come out scorching hot, it didn't. They were nearly room temp and the breeding was much different than the typical tempura, more like a panko. Next I had a Seattle roll which was very good and my son had the nickel bento. I find bento boxed all pretty have the same taste no matter where you go, this was no acceptation. Overall it was a good deal and a cute little place but can't say we will go back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the city for the lowest price as far as I'm concerned. Service is excellent and atmosphere is great. I love their spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls. Eat here once or twice a week. Also they have a liquor license so you can have a drink with your meal as well!"}
{"text":"Friendly and nice, can't wait to come back again!  I'm from California and from now on when I pass thru Oregon that's a pit stop!!"}
{"text":"Fairly inexpensive. Not the greatest, not the freshest. It was just...meh. Your typical inexpensive half-good sushi restaurant. Staff was alright, not friendly but not rude. . The food came fairly quickly, maybe 3-5 minutes after I ordered. The sides for the lunch specials come with sweet potato rolls, salad and egg noodles, which is different from the normal salad and miso soup.This is the kind of place you go to if you're craving sushi but you're on a budget."}
{"text":"Their chef changed recently and their portions for sushi & sashimi have been reduced dramatically.

Food is prepared clean and they use decent quality fish.
Their tempura is actually pretty good.

Good place for lunch, not so much for dinner as it gets pretty pricey for no particular reason."}
{"text":"Not good...very few options...we order 10different type of sushi and all pf them tastes the same..:("}
{"text":"Love supporting this family business. Yummy, quick, and hits the sushi spot without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"I give one star to our waitress because she was nice, but I did not like the quality of the food. I mean what do you expect from a $12.99 AYCE. The fish to rice was way off. I've been to better sushi places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Top fresh and clean; nice choice of bento; correct prices; very nice staff; and mega HUGE rolls woaaahhhooooooo
(they should just include some free small sides, like free miso soup, to obtain 5 stars)"}
{"text":"Wow! Great sushi in Phoenix Oregon? Who would of thought? I'm always on the hunt for a good place to eat, let alone a great sushi restaurant! Me,  My girlfriend and her daughter were out on a drive and looking for lunch. I saw a hint on yelp that this place had great reviews, so we thought we would give it a try. When we came in the place was empty but that didn't reflect the food. The owner and Sushi chef was the only employee that we saw and he was very attentive and friendly. My girlfriend and I had the lobster sushi roll. I am a lobster fanatic. If you love lobster like I do? You have to try this. Lots of tender lobster meat in a slightly spicy sauce. We also enjoyed two other sushi rolls that were delicious. My girlfriends daughter is very picky about her food and doesn't eat fish of any kind. She ordered the teriyaki  chicken and must have loved it because her plate was cleaned! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decent sushi in a pinch. I've had worse and I've had better.

Came in here for lunch (13.99 now) thinking I was super hungry but it turns out that I wasn't. Quality of fish was so-so, but there was too much rice in each maki/nigiri. Ice cream at the end was already soft like soft-serve. Not a memorable place but I think it is better than Kyoto down the street."}
{"text":"To be quite honest, I only ended up coming here for lunch because Japango just down the street was packed full and there was like a 30 min wait. I didn't know this place existed and it can be quite easy to just pass by. Unlike Japango, we didn't have to wait at all to get seated.

They have a pretty big menu, and their bento boxes look like pretty good deals, since you can get a pretty big amount of food for less than $10. Because I still had Japango on the mind though, I was determined to try one of their \"Special Rolls,\" and ordered the Rainbow Roll which was basically a California Roll topped with salmon, tuna, tilapia, shrimp and avocado. It came with 10 pieces, which was sufficient for lunch, and was presented quite nicely with some sauce drizzled on top and on the plate. It was pretty flavourful on its own and with the sauce, so soy sauce wasn't even necessary.

I will say that on the whole I enjoyed my roll, although it didn't really stand out to me or blow me away. It was definitely pretty decent, it was fresh, it was tasty, but just not particularly memorable - especially considering it was a \"special\" roll, I guess my expectations were just higher. I don't think the staff came around too frequently, but they were generally pleasant. Could have used more water refills though.

Would I come again? Probably. I don't think I would make a trip out of my way just to come here, but if I was in the area again, then sure."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place that I found through yelp and I agree it's fantastic! Great Sushi with lots of meat, Bento is great too for those who don't like raw fish."}
{"text":"Horrible sushi, bombarded by flies the entire meal. Sushi were just all rice. Do not come here. Awful and will never return"}
{"text":"Out for a walk we were hungry for lunch and spotted Sushi & Bento and decided to give it a try. Located in a strip of restaurants along Dundas Street just west of Bay and east of University the restaurant is located on the south side of the street with windows looking north. The place is small with a selection of tables running along both walls of the restaurant and the sushi bar and kitchen at the back of the restaurant. The service was quick and attentive but we were disappoint by the quality of the food. Like a lot of sushi places in Toronto the sushi was dressed with mayo to hide the fact that it was poor quality sushi. Between us we had the tempura udon and a bento box and the only thing that was any good was the edamame that came with the bento box. I guess restaurants like this depend on the rushed taste buds of the lunch crowd from nearby offices."}
{"text":"This is the first time I tried this place. I'm always happy to see another sushi place open. I stopped in for lunch. Tried the lunch special beef bowl. The flavor was pretty good. A little on the sweet too side. The beef was very tough. It really gave my jaw a workout. $2.00 for a tiny bottle of ice tea was a little steep. 
The place is clean and bright. 
I'll be back to try the sushi and post an update."}
{"text":"What an awesome meal. Sushi was fresh. Service was excellent. Nice family running the restaurant. Not busy but should be!!  Ordered chicken teriyaki, spring rolls , and shrimp tempura.  Everything fabulous !!!  Great experience and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Located in the left back corner of a small plaza, Sushi & Bento is a clean & well-maintained shop. The family running the restaurant is friendly. Food is prepared on order, so you know it's freshly made.

Prices are a bit steep-- which I found surprising since you'd expect food in Oregon to be less expensive than California's pricey Silicon Valley or LA. 

In terms of food, I can only speak for the beef bento (~$13). You get an array of small samplers including miso soup, potstickers, California roll sushi, salad, rice, and stir-fried beef.

PROS:
The beef is the highlight. They use a sweet & tangy sauce that pairs fantastically with the meat & onions. If I could get a bowl of just this, I would. The rice is perfectly cooked & puffy with a nice chew. The mixed salad is a crisp and refreshing. 

CONS:
The potstickers have a strange minced filling that tastes grainy and mass-produced. I understand it can be difficult to have freshly-made dumplings on hand, but I would recommend to the shop to change whatever potsticker brand it currently uses. 

The imitation crab in the sushi consists of finely shredded & mushy threads-- which makes me question its quality :( Never have I ever seen imitation crab made like that... and I've had a lot of sushi throughout my life. 
Miso soup also lacks contents (no tofu or seaweed).

Overall, I didn't find my bento to be worth the price paid. Other Yelpers seem to really enjoy the sushi here though, so perhaps that would be a better option than the bentos."}
{"text":"Expected just an average ayce sushi  restaurant and got hit by one of our worst experiences.

1. The moment we sat down everyone else had 2 square tables , we had one. I reached to grab the solo square table next to me and they completely shut me down, refusing to give me a extra table even though this is an all you can eat meal and plates are bound to pile up. And what a surprise!!! The table wasn't used all night and not to mention there half of the other tables were not occupied either.

2. Food quality was below satisfactory even in ayce sushi standards. Tempura shrimp had a very unaunthentic batter and the shrimp tasted old or artificial.  Sashimi did not taste fresh and you can tell their \"torch\" sushi is basically a way to cook off the sashimi that is going stale. All the rolls has way too much rice to a point where I had to start taking it apart myself so I'm not on taking 5 days worth of carbs in one meal.

3. Selection of foods was unimpressive and  many items on the menu seem repeated with minor changes like avocado to cucumber. 

4. They actually attempted to charge is extra money for a small part of a roll that we didn't finish because it just tasted really bad and quite frankly we were eating 90% rice, 5% sauce , 5% fish.

5. Waitresses seem to be untrained and lack manners.

Overall, the restaurant did not provide a good dining experience . $43 on a weekday can go towards much better food and service, or even just a better ayce sushi restaurant. I don't think I will ever return to this place again given the bountiful amount of ayce restaurants all around toronto now."}
{"text":"My friends and I were strolling downtown looking for a sushi spot for lunch. We saw this place on Yelp and chose it because it was literally 10 metres away from where we were standing when we opened up the app. It looks like a small shop from the outside but it's well laid out on the inside and spacious enough. The tables and general look of the restaurant was clean. The bathrooms are upstairs. The service was good. Our empty plates were cleared almost immediately and we didn't have to ask for refills.

We were planning for a-la-carte and had no plans for AYCE. I know I wanted one of the torched rolls but it was $10.99, whereas AYCE was $14.99. We ended up settling for AYCE; it just made more sense that way in terms of the pricing structure. It does not include pop but includes water and green tea. It took a while for us to get our orders but once it started, everything came all at once. 

They didn't cut down on our orders and we received everything we asked for. The green salad didn't taste that fresh. Once you bit into the tempura, your mouth is immediately filled with oil. I disliked how the maki rolls were stuffed with an absurd amount of rice (you'll be able to see from my photos). I was not a fan of the green tea ice cream. It was very, VERY milky. It's good if that's your thing but I prefer to actually taste the green tea. I will not be returning."}
