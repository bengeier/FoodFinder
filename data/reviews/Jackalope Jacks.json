{"text":"A walk from my house so we frequent this place often! Although the parking sucks and theres always crazy people driving on 7th st, I like this place. We've karaoked here before and played corn hole as well its a place packed with lots of fun!"}
{"text":"I thought the brunch was just okay. The french toast was overcooked and the sausage patties were dry. I was starving so I ate it all anyway. I'd give it less stars if it weren't for the great outside dining area."}
{"text":"Two stars I give is only because I had some decent experience from previous visit.  I wouldn't give a star for the recent visit.  Me and my husband plus two dogs arrived at the patio around 8:30pm on a Thursday night, sat down for 10 mins, no one came out, it's fine, they probably just didn't know someone is out there, np.  I went in and try to get somebody, stood by the door for another 5 mins, no one even paying attention.  Finally walked up to a server by the bar, and told her we were waiting for service out at the patio.  She came out and took our appetizer order, and NEVER came back.  No appetizer, no one showed up again for 20 mins.  Me and my husband were done at that point, we left.  I still don't know if she ever noticed."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best places in Charlotte to go with friends or on a date.  It's not a real \"meet people\" atmosphere, because it's not really in a heavy bar area, at least not where you can walk to easily.  That would probably be the only downside."}
{"text":"Nice Place, quality clientel, draught specials and healthy woman."}
{"text":"Jacks is a great bar to hang out with your friends, drink many fancy drinks, and play games! Jacks has a pretty decent sized menu that has something for most types of eaters, omnivores and herbivores a like! The roasted pepper hummus makes for a great appetizer everyone can enjoy.  Jacks has a full bar, along with several specialty drinks that you can get made in big honkin' mason jars. I normally don't do flavored drinks, but they are really tasty and you only need one to calm your spirits.  Also, what better to do when your drinking than play games! It's no Dave and Busters, but Jacks does have several fun games to occupy your time there. There is plenty of seating, unless it's a weekend night, in which case the place can get pretty packed. Jacks is definitely a good time for all!"}
{"text":"bloody mary...decent  brunch item (Tex-Mex eggs and potatoes)....should have gone to waffle house  spent $15 plus tip on some very mediocre food.  Hopefully I just ordered the wrong thing but was assured by the bartender that \"everything\" on the menu is great."}
{"text":"A fun place to spend a few hours in the afternoon having a few drinks with friends and playing games. Indoor ski ball, pool, darts, and corn hole outside as well. Decent specials and the bar food isn't bad either. It's a nice spot."}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of my favorite places to go!!  Partly because I work there for 2 years!  LOL And it's just one of the best places to go get some drinks and hang with your friends!  Love all the bartenders and servers!  Especially Ben :)  You'll always run into someone that you know at Jack's.  And the food is always good!!  I think I have had most everything on the menu but I usually get my favorites.  I ususally stick with what I know!  Haven't had their brunch yet but I do love to go on a Sunday afternoon for some mimosas!  It's in a great location and you'll always have fun!!!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I ate there for lunch around 2 yesterday first time.  It was so good.  He had country fried chicken smothered gravy and mashed potatoes and slaw.  And I had chicken tenders and slaw.  We had chili cheese fries for an appetizer.  Everything was so fresh and made from scratch.  The slaw was just like the finely grated slaw with the milky dressing I had as a kid.  The honey mustard sauce with a touch of lime was outstanding.  The mashed potatoes were red potatoes and were freshly mashed with just a hint of a red skin which we love.    The chicken was moist and hot.  Chili cheese fries had the most wonderful ground meat, black bean, tomato pieces and melted cheese over the crisp hot fries but were not dredging them.    I would highly recommend this as a place to eat.  We did not go there for the drinks but I am sure that is a great experience as well.  But who would think that bar food could be so good.  It was much more than bar food.  More like grandma's homecooking."}
{"text":"Reasonable drink prices and an ok bar food menu, don't exect anything special."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Food was average. I got a burger and it wasn't anything special. Took a risk and got the slaw...one bite and I was done. Smoking allowed outside on deck so I would sit in a space that you feel comfortable with."}
{"text":"Jackalope Jack's is a pretty good hangout spot in Elizabeth. It's not ostentatious, and they've got a lot of different options for people, from skee ball, to games on the TV, to cornhole boards out front. The lunch and dinner food is OK, but the brunch food is surprisingly good. The only thing to remember is that it is a bar, which means that food service is not the best, so expect to be there a while. Definitely worth a look if you just want to hang out."}
{"text":"My server was covered up. I never had a chance to even order food. It was a Tuesday at 5 so it wasn't that packed. I didn't even get a chance to get a check. I just left some money on my table and left. It was bad news bears for me."}
{"text":"This is a great place for night time drinks.  The bartenders are attentive and know how to make a good cocktail.  The place is spacious and offers an outdoor seating area and another smaller bar area outside of the main bar/game room area.  Speaking of games, there's a variety: pool, skee ball, etc...  I haven't sampled anything from the food menu yet, but based on conversations with other patrons it's pretty decent bar food."}
{"text":"The worse bbq pork ever. I think the cook threw it in a pan of grease to reheat it. I took one bite and spit it out... the waitress says to me \"sorry you didn't  like it\"  and took it to the trash 9 bucks later. lame."}
{"text":"I ended up at this neighborhood bar three days in a row somehow, and I had few complaints. The bartenders (courtney and jared) were great, really amiable people, and the daily specials were pretty tasty. I wasn't too thrilled to find that the ladies stalls in the bathrooms have no hooks, since I don't go anywhere without my purse, and the interior sound was a little loud for me, but overall a good experience and a place I'll be planning on frequenting."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place soooo many times. It always seems crowded and everyone on the patio always seems to be enjoying themselves. Finally this weekend we decided to give it a try. We went to watch the game and had a great time. Great beer specials, great food, great service. I ordered the chicken wrap with bacon and teriyaki sauce. Delish!!    I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped on on Saturday afternoon when they happen to show English league soccer games which seemed unique to me . Breakfast was served till 2pm and had bangers & a definite British spin on it. I opted for a  burger & fries. Burger was hand formed & juicy. It was very good. Fries were standard. Your basic sports bar with plenty of tv's, wood paneling, a big outside area on a busy street in the hip Plaza Midwood section of town."}
{"text":"I had the monttery burger. W/o the bbq sauce. It was gooood! Good fries too (seasoned). Good atmosphere. Typical bar. We ate @ 6:45 pm or so on a wensday and good atmosphere to bring a 12 y/o."}
{"text":"This is my go-to bar/restaurant because it has so much to offer. Games, Karaoke and Trivia are always happening indoors, with a plethora of TV's for your sporting needs. Outdoors, there are essentially 2 levels of seating: One right along 7th Street where there are plenty of tables and chairs with umbrellas at most of them, and a covered deck with longer tables that is great for bigger groups. They also have a big cornhole set, which is tucked to the left of the place (if you're facing it), keeping you safe from cars.  They allow dogs on both parts of the deck, which is why we come here often with our little Boston Terrier. They always bring a water bowl and a treat or two, and they are super nice about if the dog bowl spills, which happens often with my rambunctious pup.  The food is actually really good. They must double-fry their french fries because they are THE BEST. Super crunchy, not too greasy. Their tots and sweet potato tots are also awesome! I love their hummus, wraps, and most of their sandwiches. Also, Sunday Brunch is outta this world if you're hurting from the night before. Hello garbage plates!  Drink-wise, I have only stuck to beer. Yuengling now sponsors the Mason Jars so they cannot serve anything but in them. That makes me sad. I hope they get Bud Light back in the jars, or some other large vessel!  All in all, the service is usually really good, the food is really good for bar food, and you can almost always find a table when it's busy."}
{"text":"Great spot for Sunday brunch or a game... They seem to have every game going, room for you and your dog on the outside patio along with a great bar and great staff inside.  They have some good taps with a little bit of everything for everyone, good place to bring friends and hang out."}
{"text":"I come here every once in a while and when I do, I think \"why don't I come here more often?\" This place always has a lively atmosphere and the staff is always great....and not too hard on the eyes. \"Hey, who said that?!\"   The paninis here are delicious and I like that I can get tater tots with them. The beer selection is good and its easy to strike up a conversation with a stranger. The clientele are regular folks with regular jobs. This place is probably the best place in elizabeth for a relaxing NO DRAMA atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited Jacks on 7/3 and the male bartender was extremely rude.  I'm sorry you have a fun job and have to serve people beer and drinks, I know it's a huge burden.   Lack of basic customer service skills, dirty looks when I asked a simple question about what beers you have, and throwing the credit card/receipt when we payed as if it was a good riddance.  I know it won't affect Jack's at all, but the three of us won't be coming back.    Jack's also saves their overflow from the draft beers and has them sit in mason jars.  We sat in front of the taps for a good 15 minutes and observed this disgusting action  *The mason jars were there before we sat down so the beer sitting in them was older than 15 minutes*.  When someone ordered that particular beer, they would start off by pouring that nasty room temperature beer into the pint glass and then top it off with fresh beer from the tap.  This is all sorts of wrong, first off it's against health code.  Secondly it shows what kind of product you serve and what you think of your guests.  I mentioned this to the non-angry bartender *she was actually really nice* and her response was that they couldn't waste it.  So I believe that this is coming down from the Owners/Management.  I understand about controlling waste, but this is really down right wrong and disgusting."}
{"text":"So I went to Jack's today for the special which was fish tacos.  I didn't expect them to be fried but, they were still quite tasty.  The batter was a simple beer batter (i asked) and super crispy!  My friend also thought his were good. The side was rice & beans  with a little kick.  I like kick! So, I liked them. I wasn't impressed with the tea since it tasted instant, I'm from the south & a self~proclaimed tea expert ;)  but our bartender had no problem switching my drink out for something else.  The bartender was great, made a good bloody mary, sorry we didn't catch her name. We went in around 1, and it wasn't busy, so we got to speak with her and the owner a bit and they really made us feel welcome.  Definitely putting it in the lunch rotation, 'cause it was good stuff."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork BBQ.  I'm from Texas, so the sauce is VERY different from what I'm used to, but it was really good.  Tater tots on the side were also better than I'd expect, for what that's worth.  Friendly wait staff, LOTS of TVs."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite bars in Charlotte.  Coming back for the holidays we planned a get together of friends here and everything went well.  Service was good, beer was good and affordable, and there was plenty of space.  Also the no smoking area was great!  Although I know that will be everyone like next week.  Plus they have fried pickles!  I don't like them as much as regular pickle chips, but they satisfied my craving so I can't complain!    I'll be back whenever I'm in town, I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch one day and had there burger and fries. Everything was great and we will go back. Looks like they have a whole lot to offer the night crowds especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review because service and food can change drastically over a short time. Since moving to the Charlotte area in june 2015, this has hands down become my favorite place to get a great burger. I've been here approx 6 times in the last 6 months, most recently a few days ago. I've never received bad service or my order wrong or improperly cooked meal. It's a bar/pub/tavern experience so it is noisy, but the food and people are great and it features sports on tv, a pool table, and skee ball which my kid loves. There is also a huge outdoor seating area when temps are milder. Very ample food options for the kids too."}
{"text":"Favorite place in Charlotte! We go here all the time, and love the atmosphere. They have all times of games - skeeball, pool, pop-a-shot and cornhole. There are always drink specials, and karaoke if you like that. The outside patio is huge, so definitely check them out! Parking can be a little scarce, but that applies to the whole neighborhood. Most people walk or cab it anyway."}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience at this place today.  The waitress was so unfriendly and rude and the food came out cold, plus she got the order wrong for 2 of the 8 people in the group.  We complained to the manager, but he was pretty much useless and simply asked what we wanted him to do about it.  I won't be going back to this place, and neither will the 7 others with me."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just moved to the neighborhood and thought this place would be a great place to grab some drinks and dinner. Man, I wish we would've  stopped at \"drinks\". We first ordered the knife and fork BBQ basket. Good but so dry. We had to ask for so many sauces to make up for it. Next I ordered the \"thanksgiving\" sandwich. Before ordering I read about the carved turkey, cornbread stuffing, and cranberry jelly covered in gravy that made this item sound soooo delicious! When I got it.. The lunch meat turkey was burnt, the jelly turned into 5 craisins, and the stuffing was so where to be found. Not to mention the burnt bread. I'm still salty about it. Good place to drink, but not eat."}
{"text":"Jackalope Jack's is a good little spot.  Definitely more of a chill hang out and have a good time with friends bar versus a \"scene.\"  I went to trivia on Tuesday and the crowd was intimate but seemed to be filled with regulars.  The trivia was pretty challenging and legit.  I didn't try the food but my friends who did said it is pretty standard bar fare."}
{"text":"Slightly disappointing ... definitely a lower quality restaurant with average at best food."}
{"text":"I give them 3 stars because the burger I ordered was awesome. However, the service left much to be desired. I started a tab at the bar and for what i don't know because they probably checked with me twice.. my drink was decent. I would've been more understanding had they been super busy but they weren't. I'd order take out but probably won't dine in again.. maybe head over to Kennedys or Thomas st. Better service."}
{"text":"Oh Jackalope Jack's. I've been here a few times for drinks and karaoke...which is very fun. The atmosphere is awesome...at night. For drinks.  We went by this Sunday evening for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the BBQ sandwich (which I had been craving) and my bf ordered a kobe burger...neither of which they had. Really?! So we both settled on something else while we were snacking on our nachos. He ended up getting a regular burger that was charred and the inside of the bun was black. They got him a new one...but still No apologies for anything. This is the second time they have been out of something, although last time it was just one person's meal that they didn't have.  The waitress was decent. We ran out of our drinks a couple of times and had to ask for refills.  Go for beer. Not food. Or service."}
{"text":"Solid hole in the wall sports bar. Funky akward patio definitely gives it character needed for return visit. Solid spot. Nothing to go out of the way for but if in the area. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is very unique and a whole lot of fun.  They have games, karaoke, music.  What more could you want?  They have a nice big bar and is actually pretty spacious, but still has a very cozy and welcoming atmosphere.  The burgers are really good, cooked really well and the toppings tasted fresh.  The people are really fun too.  Not just the staff either, the other customers are a hoot if you come in on the right night."}
{"text":"Nothing great, but a step up for bar food, that's for sure!  I love getting the chicken finger wrap (grilled instead of fried, with buffalo sauce).  Their tater tots are some of the best in town too!  I had a bad experience with trivia there once (the hostess told us we were not allowed to cheer and that we needed to be quiet, cause she gets annoyed by loud noises...REALLY?!?!?  I think they fired her).  They have a few ski ball games and I once stopped in on \"League Night\" and ended up playing for a while in a legue for free...still not sure how that happened.  Oh...and beer in a mason jar, gotta love that!"}
{"text":"Is it ok to call this place JJ's? If not, too bad, as it's too long to type out. Been here a few times, though not a frequent visitor. Nice bar layout, with the bar located in the center of the place, with seating areas on either side, as well as out front near the cornhole area. Beer is cheap...$1.75 for PBR cans...awesome deal (right Jay R)! Ordered the fish & chips on my recent visit and it was ok...a little too fried for me. Tatar tots were good though! Server was very busy, but very attentive, which was nice as we weren't forgotten about.   Went on karaoke night, which was hysterical. Only downside is that we were sitting right next to the stage and it made for some interesting viewing. All and all a decent hangout place offering something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Having been to Jacks many times over the last few years I'll try and condense my experience here in one review here. Jacks has always been a fun place to go hang out but lately it seems to either be more my type of place or some of the remodeling they did to the front patio have made it a bit more appealing. Not sure which. the whole place feel like it just has more space to fit people in even though the rooms seem to be partitioned off as they are. Their food is your usual type bar food and all very good however the Buffalo Chicken sandwich is extremely delicious. The bacon Jalapeno hush puppies are worth a try also and pretty unique. The only down side I would say is that if you get a table on the outside during a busy night (some friends and I went this past saturday) the servers can't seem to keep up. I'm guessing it may have to do with a pretty small central bar area trying to serve many people across a somewhat spread out area. It just felt like we were left waiting more often than not. That is not to say the servers or bartenders were jerks about it, quite the opposite, but that can usually put people off of a place on busy nights.   Bottom line, you should definitely try this place out if you are looking for a more laid back atmosphere. Reasonably priced food and drinks are always a good combo in my book."}
{"text":"The GREAT thing about my visit was my server. She was very helpful and cool. The burger was good! Hanna! Was super cool with questions I had. And that's cool"}
{"text":"I'll admit that I was dying to come here after I saw this place featured on the travel channel. I ended up ordering their mexi-cali burger with a side of tater tots. It was good but nothing spectacular. I didn't think it was worth it to upgrade the patty to a kobe beef one because I figured it would've been too greasy at that point (kobe beef has a high fat content which is why it's so tasty) but I might try it one day.   The mexi-cali was tasty but I didn't think it was necessary to deep fry the jalapeno rings. Our table split an order of fried pickles and they were pretty tasty though very salty (of course because they're pickles). They weren't the little pickle rings but rather the long flat pickle strips. If you aren't watching your sodium intake I'd give them a try. Overall the food was just average.   Perhaps if I were more of a drinker I would like it more but the burger was about on par with what you could order from a Five Guys. The wait staff is super friendly and very efficient when we were there but it was also a pretty slow day."}
{"text":"3 stars as a restaurant 4 as a bar.  BTW:I apologize for my lackluster previous review.  When I first discovered yelp I went for quantity, not quality.  So this place used to be Jack Straw's which was probably THE best music venue the the town has ever \"scene\".  Well its not that place anymore.  Its still worth visiting and has more than just a bar or restaurant vibe to it.  On nice sunny days the deck is beautiful.  We had a going away party for a friend today.  We made reservations for 30 for Sunday brunch.  Only place in town with a mimosa deal that would take a crowd like us.  You would think that they would maybe tell a couple of extra servers to come in at least for the hour or 2 we were there.  We had 2 servers for our group and they also had other tables.  They did well, but felt I pretty bad for the other tables.  The brunch menu was large, but mostly it was just slight variations on eggs and meat with some major exceptions.  It was a cheaply made paper menu, but the one thing that stood out \"the hangover\" which was a breakfast sandwich on a doughnut.  But, they don't serve it anymore, even though it was on this cheaply made menu.  I tasted many peoples dishes, they were good but over priced.  Everything was roughly $9 except for biscuits and gravy and french toast.  Although, the $2 mimosa's and $4 bloody mary's is hard to beat.  All in all, this place has a history that it doesn't live up to.  Its good, but plenty of other places to go.  Side notes:Parking lot sucks, but its made up by the fact that they have SKEEBALL!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went been going to Jacks now for about five years and after going there over the weekend I realized that I have never reviewed the restaurant. Jacks certainly has changed over the past few years. Not only have they changed the format inside but also the clientele has changed as well. Ultimately one thing has not changed.... Jacks is simply a city staple. You are pretty much going to have a great time with your friends when going to Jacks. In particular they are always jamming on the weekends with good live entertainment. They still have a game room that seems like it is always changing. Unfortunately I love shuffle board and it seems they have replaced the shuffle board with ski ball. Jack's I love you but I miss the ski ball."}
{"text":"Their dirty taps make all draught beer 'doo-doo beer.'  That being said - fun place to drink off of 7th street with people who have likely been in charlotte for a long time.  Just order bottled beer......"}
{"text":"Good burgers, friendly staff, plenty to drink and even had a girl tell me she wanted to grab my butt (patron, not bar staff)...so how can I rate this place anything less than a 5??? LOL! Love Jack's, great people, all the games on the many different screens and an outdoor patio for the spring/summer/fall seasons. Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I haven't written a review for Jacks.  Maybe I've just been there so many times that I completely forgot to.  Jacks is the closest bar to my house.  I could throw a baseball and hit it if I wanted.  Needless to say, I go there frequently.  Mostly to drink.  They ALWAYS have a drink special and it's usually a pretty damn good one. The $2-3 beer special is what I go for most of the time.  It's an extremely cozy bar inside too.  Low ceiling, lots of TV's, unique decor, and a friendly bartender.  The bartenders here are always great from what I've experienced.  The food is pretty good considering, you know, you're at a bar.  I'd definitely consider it above average for a sports bar.  Check out the brunch though, it's a fun place to work off your hangover on Sunday morning.  The mimosas I had last time were on point and I'm picky on the amount of OJ some places will use.  Oh, and one last thing?  How can I forget the epic bar games in the back?  Coolest game area in the Charlotte area!  Skee ball, arcade basketball, golden tee, and more!"}
{"text":"They have a pretty big menu for Brunch ... much bigger than most places in my opinion. Prices are decent too ... almost everything is under $10. If you're looking for a run of the mill brunch spot where you can hang out on the patio, I'd give this a try.   I ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich with a side of cheesy grits. The turkey on the sandwich was good ... fresh carved style. \"French Toast\"/bread of it was a little on the soft/soggy side ... would have much more preferred it was some crispness. The raspberry compote was kind of runny, nothing to write home about. My wife and I both thought the cheesy grits were very plain.   Wife ordered the Florentine garbage plate which lacked flavor and was extremely 'basic'. She had to load it up with hot sauce to eat it."}
{"text":"Mediocre, but expensive food. I got the grilled chicken quesadilla the other night, it was about $10-11. They asked if I wanted sour cream, to which I said yes. When I got my bill, I realized that the thimble of sour cream was an additional $1. The food is definitely way overpriced, particularly for the quality. The service seems a bit scatter brained."}
{"text":"Jackalope Jacks was one of the first bars I visited when I moved to the Queen City 2 1/2 years ago. I frequent there often, and it's a favorite among my group of friends.   The crowd is great if your looking for a group of young professionals in a casual atmosphere. Skee ball, pool, corn-hole, outdoor seating, and karaoke are among the activities you will find here. The food is great just don't order the deviled eggs, sounds like a good idea but is definitely not a menu item you should order I think at any restaurant.   I tried the chicken pita the other night and I have a craving for it already. Grilled chicken in a warm pita topped with a handful of french fries, and tzatziki  yum.   All in all this is a great place to hang with a crowd.....and I almost forgot they serve beer in a mason jar!"}
{"text":"Note:  I came here for brunch, and the brunch I shall review.   It's happened to us all.  You were out drinking on Saturday night.  You may or may not have slept on your friend's couch.  You wake up on Sunday around 1 with a hangover and a burning desire for something delicious in your belly.  Everyone piles in the car, protesting at the brightness of that damn sun, giggling, still a little delirious from the night before.  If this ever happens to you, and you're in the area, I feel totally confident suggesting you go to jackelope jack's for the best meal of all:  BRUNCH.    an excuse to eat breakfasty food and drink alcohol to cure your hangover/start a new buzz going.  while some people are in church worshipping the lord, i am a devotee at the altar of the mimosa.    we sat outside, much to my chagrin...but you kind of have to on a day as beautiful as this particular sunday.  despite following the shade under the umbrella as the afternoon lengthened and more drinks were ordered, my vampire skin burnt to a crisp, but everything was so delicious it was totally worth it.    I got a mimosa, natch, and the three-cheese omelet.  It was cheddar, provolone, and some other cheese I don't remember.  It came out with some of the best home fries i've ever had, along with a side of bacon which was cooked perfectly.  Everyone else's meals looked similarly delectable.  I wish I had thought to take a picture because it was a damn attractive plate of food.      The only snag was when we ordered pancake shots (jameson+frangelica chased with orange juice...seriously tastes EXACTLY like a pancake.)  and there was no frangelica...a rude awakening, that.  no one needs a shot of straight jameson to the face before they've even had their coffee.  (at least, not me or my friends...)  but they quickly fixed the problem and comped us the shots.    So to wrap up this epic screed, if you're hungover, looking to get drunk again in the day without feeling guilty (the Rules Of Brunch) go by Jackelope Jack's.  get the pancake shots.  sure, they cost as much as my omelet, but who doesn't love getting drunk on pancakes!?"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service SUCKS. Had to wait 20 minutes for a drink. Was sitting at a table outside then moved inside to the bar hoping service would be better. Currently sitting at the bar with empty glasses. If you're trying to drink, DONT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"I walked in an immediately could tell this is a fun place! I had lunch here on a weekday so it was calm but there were quite a few tables filled. They've got tvs all over the place so you're bound to be into watching something. I had a sweet tea and the Panther Melt. Cam was my fantasy QB and I had just posed in front of the BofA stadium, so the Panther Melt was calling out to me. The Panther Melt is a burger that has grilled onions, blue cheese crumbles, and whipped bacon & blue cheese mustard on toasted white bread, with your choice of side. The Panther Melt isn't one of their signature dishes, and I'm not surprised. It's very mustard-y, as the description will tell you, so it's go to have a side of tots, like in my case. Towards the end, there was too much mustard for me to handle so I had to scrape some of it off. The side of tots, though, was perfect and the right amount. My husband had \"The Cowboy Way\", which is one of their signature dishes and he loved it! I took a bite of it and it was very flavorful. I wasn't in the mood for all the bacon and BBQ sauce, but if that's what you're looking for, then that's the burger for you. He also got tots, which I was surprised when he ordered because he isn't a tots guy. But he loved them!   Afterwards we even went with a dessert, which is rare. The brownie and ice cream we got was a hit. I tapped out after a few bites but my man kept going at it and loved every bite.  Good NC experience!"}
{"text":"Fun place!  They have ski ball, that's always fun.  Cool place to go and pub crawl to P-Stone and Kennedy's!"}
{"text":"So, I love Jack's as a nightime/karaoke hangout but recently discovered the wonderment that is Jackalope's brunch! I've been with two big groups recently and the food is always fantastic, the service is quick and friendly, and if you go before 12 on Sunday (pre booze time in NC), you pretty much have the place to yourself. Joe loves the garbage platter (which has literally everything you can imagine ever possibly wanting to eat for breakfast), and I love the California Omelet!"}
{"text":"I was with my business partner and her dog so we sat out on the front patio, nice atmosphere, the servers were all very very nice, they brought out water for my partners dog. The food was, ok nothing absolutely special, the hummus was good I just wish there were more pita squares because we ran out of them before the hummus had a dent in ot...there was no kind of dipping sauce for the sweet tots , I had the roast beef wrap and I've had better.   Good location, nice servers , just middle of the road I guess"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time New Years Day as not much else was open.  Was a fun atmosphere and the beers were good.  All the food was SO terrible, so I was inclined to write this review.    Buffalo wings:  Not crispy at all, very chewy. Had to have been frozen.  Buffalo chicken sandwich: Again, very chewy and definitely frozen and/or microwaved.  Fried okra: No flavor again, not crispy (this seems to be a trend, not sure what was going on in the kitchen that day)  Buffalo chicken dip: Portion was so small, which was surprising because it is what appears to be a sports bar...  Burger: did not have this, but a friend did.  Looked so incredibly average and unappetizing.  We never said anything to the waitress (maybe that's our fault), but hope they see this and implement some changes. I will never go back there to eat. Maybe for a beer, if every other one of my go-to spots is closed or packed...."}
{"text":"Very fun comfortable environment.  The \"Cowboy Way\" burger is amazing.  Their chili cheese tater tots are delicious but be prepared to share!"}
{"text":"Man this place rocks.   A nice bar-restaurant with the best food.  You must try the thanksgiving panni sandwich.   Easy access from uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Jackalopes is most definitely a DIVE BAR! What bothers is the lack of systems in this place. I really think they need a hostess! You walk in and there are multiple rooms to the right and left. If you sit yourself plan on waiting because servers don't watch their sections OR aybe they don't have sections! Either way its a lack of systems and organization. I have been here any times because I used to live within walking distance of the bar. Every single time I have left irritated! Came in for drinks and apps but they forgot my app. Sat myself, waited for 10 minutes before finally asking for help. Asking for our check and no one ever comes back! Quality of service just isn't high for this place.   As for the menu its average. The best food item I have had is the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich. I also like that they have fried okra.   I just really dont suggest this place to friends. Its more of a last resort!"}
{"text":"In the past two weeks I have been here thrice- on twice on a weekend evening and once on a weeknight. I love the proximity, the indoor/outdoor seating, the goat cheese on the CaliCali burger....I do not like the atrocious service. Servers consistently go MIA, never bring waters or refills, or your check or your credit card back.  This location is walking distance to my home and the service has always been hit or miss but when you overhear other diners commenting on how slow the service is you know that this isn't just an occasional issue."}
{"text":"Came into this place on a whim for dinner as we were in the area. Old school bar atmosphere. Food was very good. It was a slow Tuesday night and service was less than par. It's a seat yourself but with multiple rooms and no hostess or anyone to greet you, it makes it very awkward. Menu had variety. Few tvs. It was Trivia night as well but we left prior to that starting. Drink selection was okay but you Could probably find a better place for just drinks with a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened to this place. I used to go to Jacks all the time. The owner opened a new restaurant and apparently doesn't pay much attention to this one. The food used to be great. Now, it is terrible. Still a fun place to drink. Just, don't eat here."}
{"text":"Dive bar to good to lose. Great food and frequently staff. Darts and pool tables. Lots of tables inside and out. Some parking."}
{"text":"Jackalope Jacks is an odd place to categorize.  It's too big to be a pub, and although there are plenty of tvs, not everyone is there to watch sports. It's more of a loud, crowded hangout spot.  Jacks is located on 7th St., between Hawthorne's Pizza and Philosopher's Stone.   The first thing I noticed when I entered was that there are many different sections to the interior.   There is a dining room to the right where I've seen karaoke happening, a large bar area straight ahead, a game area with pool tables and mini-shuffleboard to the right, with another dining area linked to that. I was initially a bit confused trying to take it all in and figure out where to go.  There is also a fairly spacious patio outside, which is great in warm weather and when the inside is crowded and smoky.  I've never eaten here, so I can't speak to the quality of the food.  The beer is nice and cold though, so that's generally good enough for me.   Jacks is open 11am-2am everyday. There is a live trivia contest every Tuesday at 8:30, with $2.50 Yuengling draft and $2 Black and Tan bottles. The aforementioned karaoke debacle, I mean, event, is held on Thursday and Saturday nights starting at 10:30."}
{"text":"Great patio & fun place. Food is good. Black & Blue quesadilla is craveable. They could diversify their draft selection some. More malty selection."}
{"text":"4 to 3.5!   The appetizer fried pickles were nice, they were sliced very thin but still very long in the shape of the dill!  They are fried to perfection, very nice almost chip like crunch their that thin but definitely get the pickle.  For entree ordered the pork and apple and stuffing sandwich.  Pretty good, but would have preferred a slaw of some kind instead of the stuffing, I like apple sauce with pork! Friendly waitstaff!"}
{"text":"I did not eat any food, but I did enjoy the bar atmosphere and getting served, even though it was crowded, was not a problem.  The bartender was friendly and fast.  The karaoke was a little tough on the ears, so we stayed out of that room and enjoyed the football games on TV on the other side.  Overall, it was a good place to go for more late night drinking..."}
{"text":"Jackalopes is in a great location & nice patio. It's better as a bar than restaurant. Food can be a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been headed here a lot more often lately so I thought it was prime time to write a review.  I like this place for a few reasons - my primary reason is the GAMES!!!  From cornhole, ski ball (it's back for those that missed it for a while), to foosball it's a game player's delight!  This bar comes equipped with a quarter machine so you don't have to keep bugging the bartenders.  Jack's is also well known for their karaoke.  I'm appreciative that this goes on in a separate room from the bar area.  If you've never been to the karaoke here it's pretty cool but after a while, you get to know the regulars and it loses its spark.  The bar is pretty small and it can get crowded around midnight.  I've never had a horrible time getting a drink but gender may play a part in that one!  The crowd is laid back but it can actually feel like a meat market at times.  Lots of boys staring down the girls but without the grinding of the uptown clubs.  I've had the food here a twice.  I'm a huge fan of the tater tots.  Other than that, it's above average bar food.  After 11 - 11:30 on a Friday or Saturday it gets sticky finding a spot.  Many people park across the street when things start to overflow."}
{"text":"Amazing bar food. Great atmosphere and lots of activities. Great night life as well. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"We went to Jacks as a SportsLink pregame event for the Checkers opening game.   We arrived about 1 1/2 hour before the game began.    Sadly, I cannot review the food, since we never got or order.   It took about 10 minutes to be greeted by our waiter,and we ordered drinks.  When he returned with the beers, but not the 1 water, we immediately ordered our food.  After another 10 minutes my daughter had to go into the bar to get the missing water.  The water had a chemical taste, and I went back to my car to retrieve a bottled for her.    After another 10 minutes the waiter can out to check in us and realized we had not gotten our food yet.    After checking he returned and told us he lost our order.   By now it was too late to get any food.   The manager Ben was very apologetic, but there was not much he could do to correct the situation.  Our beers were included with the game tickets, and we never got any food.  He did offer to buy us our meal next time we dine there.   Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a promotion with work buddies. Had great drink specials. Loved the pool table and karaoke, couldn't get one of the skeeball machines to work. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The pork nachos were to die for and the fried pickles were delish!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's been a loooong time since I visited Jack's for bar night; this review is about their Sunday brunch.  We tried to go to Jack's a few weeks ago for Sunday brunch, and we got there at 10:35 since their website and Facebook pages both said they open at 10:30.  We got there and the hours on the door said 11:00 a.m. Sunday.  Argh.  Consistency in publicizing hours seems like the easiest thing a restaurant/bar can do, so that stuck in my craw, especially since I was starving.  We went again today - at 11:15 - and the place was about halfway full.  Our hostess and waitress were nice, the food selection was great and the prices were almost too low for what you get.  I ordered the Hungry Jack - two eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes AND pancakes for $8.99.  For all that food, I would've expected to pay a lot more!  Fella got the Chicken Biscuit, and I think it was an entire fried chicken with a fried egg on a biscuit; it also came with taters or grits.    All in all, a good experience, but I just felt like I was eating breakfast in a bar that the nightly attendees had just stumbled out of a couple of hours before.  I love Jack's as a bar, but as a breakfast restaurant, it's still dark and dingy with nighttime bar music playing, which just isn't my favorite on a Sunday morning.  For my money, their other joint - The Peculiar Rabbit - is a much better brunch option."}
{"text":"They got rid of the fried chicken Benedict but brunch here is still the bomb. Easy to become a neighborhood regular, the bartenders are great! Feels like home."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this past weekend. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside on the patio, which is really nice!   Our waitress was really sweet, attentive & offered good suggestions for the menu.  Pita chips that were served with hummus were warm and soft.  I asked for the quesadillas without the meat and she suggested a black bean and corn substitute which came out fantastic!!!  My Husband got the wings and being picky when it comes to wings, he really enjoyed them!  You can play skeet ball, shoot hoops or pay a dollar to punch a bag if you need to release some frustration.  Bathrooms were clean and decked in wall graffiti which I always find cool.  Food, drinks, vibes and atmosphere- all awesome!"}
{"text":"It is another good bar spot outside of Uptown. Fitting right in with the 7th St. niche, it is low key and relaxed. Jackalope Jacks offers plenty of beer and food options with above average food which is a complement for a pub. Jackalope Jacks always seems to offer the \"extras\" so you don't have to go just for the drinks. With outdoor cornhole and music and indoor games including skeeball, it already adds more character than most bars. Add to it trivia and karaoke nights and this place should be in the regular rotation for those wanting to grab a drink with friends."}
{"text":"Below average bar/pub food. I had a chicken tender product, and basically it was the same quality as food truck food (not the famous or fancy types).   Television positioning ranges from pretty good to blah - could do much better.   The chairs are awkward (and not matching). The tables are relatively small.  It smells old, and has this slight grimey feel, even though is generally well maintained.   At least the service is pretty good and they are super friendly. Basically... don't take a girl here unless you are going to down lots of beers watching the Panthers so you can forget about how not so great this place is."}
{"text":"I like Jackalope Jacks. Service is always fine, food has never diappointed, and the patio is very fun. I like to bring my dog here on nice days, very pet friendly and outside games."}
{"text":"I've had many good nights at Jackalope's. I used to live in walking distance from the place, so it was one of my regular night spots. I get by there less frequently these days, but it's still one of my favorites in town.  There's plenty to do, and the bar is big enough that you rarely get that icky crowded bar feeling. I hate being shoulder-to-shoulder when I'm trying to order a drink. There's big tables, and the pool and video games are fun for keeping boys entertained so you have lots of time to talk to girlfriends. That's always important.  I've been around for the Thursday night karaoke, which was hilarious. I never partake in karaoke myself, but I do enjoy watching the folks who sing."}
{"text":"Great bar. Great staff. I continue to go here because of that. The definition of a neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Karaoke Friday nights. Skeeball, arcade games, pool, corn hole, tvs all around, sizeable bar area, plenty of tables, booths, bar seats. A solid place to spend a night with a group of friends. Porch area is a nice place to enjoy a warm night and people watch. Nightly drink specials. Waitresses are nice if not a bit slow, but that's probably just because it's a busy bar. Atmosphere is young professionals, nothing too wild. Parking in the back can get full. Have yet to try actual food here, but looks decent."}
{"text":"ONLY good for drinks, food is very bland & unappeasing how can anyone go wrong with a Philly cheese steak??? will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends and go karaoking!   The place is rowdy, not enough seating area if you don't come early (9pm is safe to grab a drink and wait til karaoke starts).  Although this place is not my preferred place to go sing, since the venue is blah. But at least the crowd is good, they have games to play - darts, billiards, basketball, and something that you roll with the ball and knock into the center either in 0, 10, 20, or 50 pointers. My friends liked it, so that's good enough for me."}
{"text":"Ok adding a star here, I have been here more recently and the service has improved!  It is a fun-feeling bar and I always have a good time playing skeeball or pool.  Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"Jackalope jacks has been a favorite neighborhood dive for my sister and I for about four years now. We decided to bring my mother to lunch today with our pup. There was only one table outside, and being the gorgeous day that it is we wanted to sit outside. A sever was taking the only other tables order, and afterwards he brought us menus and said he'd be back for drink orders. TWENTY SIX minutes later no one has returned to our table. We left and went to Kennedy's for a scrumptious lunch with a much more accommodating staff. Sad to see jacks' service go down the toilet."}
{"text":"I've been to Jacks probably a hundred times and for a bar, it is a really fun place. A ton of games, nice patio, and amazing karaoke. However, this Saturday night I went for dinner. Though it was pretty busy, it did take quite a while to not only get our order in, but to receive our food. My buffalo chicken wrap was pretty good and obviously the tots were amazing. Who doesn't love tots?! And I love their fried jalapenos.  So, if you aren't in any hurry, and don't mind waiting a bit, this is your place. Overall, pretty good experience but might just stick to the liquid menu there for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Jackalopes is a blend of sports, music, pool, and karaoke.  The crowd is somewhat younger, especially during the evening hours.  I ran into a lot of interesting people there, including a fellow who had just been an extra in an underground zombie movie, and he had the pictures to prove it.  Everyone loves to dance here and have a great time.  I enjoyed the beer specials and shuffleboard greatly."}
{"text":"Such a fun bar! Love to go here. Always have good beer specials. Cheap champagne :)  Good food, good brunch."}
{"text":"Great bar, wish they still have the karaoke though. Bartenders can be a hit or miss. Some are great friendly as all can be but others can be so snooty."}
{"text":"Fun place with a good vibe.  My friends and I like the skee ball and the other games they have.  The bar staff always makes delicious drinks.  Overall, a good stop when bar hopping in Elizabeth."}
{"text":"I can't imagine Charlotte without Jack's. I can't imagine myself without Jack's. The number of days and nights I have spent at this friendly neighborhood bar are far too many to count. I have eaten here, drank here, sang Meat Loaf karaoke here, played trivia here, had a birthday party here, had a jukebox singalong here, and had many unforgettable nights here. There are many local spots that are doomed to be bulldozed in the name of progress, but this one hurts the most. #SaveJacks"}
{"text":"Terrible brunch!!!  Bloody Mary taste like prison urine.  Hungry jack- entire dish was luke warm. Pancakes taste like batter. Eggs .. Gross. The two slices of bacon was essentially one whole slice cut in half they were so small. And don't get me started on the grits that had absolutely zero flavor .. Almost like it was a combo of oats and grits.   Let's just say out of the three brunch plates at our table.. Not a single one of us enjoyed a thing. We will now be paying for the shitty food with empty stomachs and grab food on our way home.  Save yourself, both time and money!"}
{"text":"I have never been to JackLopes when I've had a bad server. Everyone is very welcoming. Jack's is a really good neighborhood bar with a good soccer (and other sports) viewing scene. The decor is (formally) smokey chic with strange things hanging from the ceiling. Their hamburgers are some of the best I've had.  Go! Go Now!"}
{"text":"Totally shocking place!  Upon arrival we were met by a large haze of cigarette smoke and ash covered steps.  At this point it could only get better.  (So I thought!) I ordered a Panini with fries and Buffalo Chicken rolls.  The panini was pretty good but the fries were cold and the appetizer was cold.  I guess they cooked it for someone else earlier in the day because it arrived in a decent amount of time.  Forget the refills!  By the time I was offered a refill on my empty tea, the meal was completed.  The fact that they ran out of glasses was not my problem as they could have refilled it in the same glass.  Overall I was very disappointed and shocked as to how they could have ever been on television with such poor quality of food and lacking service. I will never recoup the 36 mile round trip I made to eat there for the first time but at least I know better in the future and I can inform others not to go there as well."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you're hungry. My man used to bring me here, but I've never had anything that I liked. Even the nachos were gross. The only thing I like about it is the pool table."}
{"text":"I love their weekend brunch!  Try the redneck garbage plate!"}
{"text":"It's a little far from where I live but my friends all love it so much I often find myself there.  The food is okay at best. The service is the same. What makes this place is the entertainment.  Karaoke on most nights is great. Skeet ball, corn hole and other games are always a pleasure."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of people to watch the Panthers slaughter the Cardinals (which we did).  I mean the place is okay but geez you need to upgrade your outdoor seating space; there's plastic instead of windows, there was only one heater in 30-degree weather, and the speakers out there were dated and didn't give the feeling of being at a football.  But it's a bar.  Just drink some more and it'll start looking better."}
{"text":"Friends tell me this place is great, but my experience was only so-so. I went for a weekend breakfast a little while back, and wasn't all that excited about the service. The place was pretty crowded, which is ok, but the waiters did little to take care of this--it took forever for us to order, and even longer to get our good. AND though I ordered poached eggs with crab cakes, the dish came out without the eggs--which is pretty bad. The food was, however, pretty darn tasty, and with huge portions, which is how I like it.   There's nice outdoor patio (not that that matters in this weather) which is great when it's warm. It was very packed, though, so prepare to wait if you want to sit outside. Apparently it's a fun place to go to at night, too, but I can't speak to that...yet."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times. It's a fun place to bring a group and have a drink. They have karaoke certain nights and bar games like darts, billiards, mini basketball hoops. Lots of tvs showing games, etc. The bar/waitstaff is really friendly and they have a good selection of drinks. You can even sit outside if you'd like.  I was reluctant to write a review about this place for months because I realized that I hadn't actually had a meal here yet, and I wanted to incorporate that into my review. Well I'm happy to report that I had a meal there last week and it was really good. I went with my softball team after a loss and our group's orders had a little bit of everything. Needless to say, we were well pleased with the food offerings. The prices for food and drinks were very reasonable as well.   It gets pretty crazy busy here on weekends, so if you're not into that, you might want to check it out on a weeknight. Other than that I like this place a lot."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've only been here on Sunday mornings for hangover cures, so I have no idea about a normal visit or a late night visit. But if you're looking for a quick bite to eat that will somewhat help cure your hangover woes, then they have the breakfast to help you out.  They have all of your normal breakfast fare, from omelets to bloody marys (if you can still stand the thought of alcohol). The food here is actually better than I thought a sports bar would have, I think you'll be surprised like I was. There really isn't anything like a big, hardy, greasy breakfast to get your day going after a long night out in the big city.  The atmosphere is nice as well, as they have plenty of tvs throughout the place for great viewing of any sporting event going on. I really like the patio area, which borders 7th street so you can traffic watch while eating or drinking. I can see this place as a great hangout spot during a relaxing evening outside of the uptown bars & restaurants.  Jackalope Jack's will take your hangover & attempt to squash it. They do a pretty good job with their breakfasts here & you get a lot of food for the price. The place isn't really ever too busy during the late morning/early afternoon hours, so you should get seating pretty quickly. Check it out after a long night out & you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The food: They keep making changes to their menu. I think this is a good thing. The brunch menu is very improved. The brunch food is heavy though and appears to be designed only for people with a hangover from the night before. The tots are yummy- add cheese and onions to them. The BBQ is gross. Seriously? Why did I order BBQ at an Australian pub (twice!)? That is totally my fault though.  The fried pickles are weak (go to Penguin for fried pickles) My husband swears by the black and blue quesadilla.  Typical for the area: Friday night and Saturday nights are overwhelming, obnoxious and something to avoid (unless you are on the prowl).   Not the best bar food- but a good place to go (especially for the world cup)"}
{"text":"I have been to Jacks several times before and the service and food has always been outstanding. Today however I waited 45 minutes without a waitress so much as looking in my direction. It was so bad that the people sitting next to me commented on the situation. When I finally stopped one of the waitresses and asked for the manager, she said he was indisposed. I brought two friends and the overall experience was positive because the manager explained the situation. My girlfriend loves this place."}
{"text":"This place overall has pros and cons, but overall, I had a great time.   SERVICE: Slllllow. Well, slow if you're sitting outside. Have not experienced the indoor service as of yet. Had to go in and ask for our waitress a majority of the time.  ENTERTAINMENT: Awesome, guys. Love me some patio action with some corn hole and watching my VCU v. Butler game on two wide screen plasmas outside. Good location.  DRINKS: We spend a decent chunk of time there, so drinks are as follows: Bloody Marys: Crappy. Weak, and not enough hot. Margaritas: Also crappy Very syrupy, and very weak. PBR buckets: Can't really go wrong there. And the winner of the night and my new all-time favorite is....: BAILEY'S BAR SHAKE WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM. May or may not have been the highlight of my night. Dunno why I've never thought to make one, but these things are friggin delicious. Hope it catches on in other establishments (hint hint, nudge nudge).   FOOD: The teriyaki chicken skewers are deeeelicious. Great, great bar food. Wish they had more options like this at other places instead of just either having fried or nachos. Kudos, Jackalope. Also, the onion rings were delicious and you get a ton.. Heard compliments on the gyros as well.  OVERALL: Will be back for the shake, but will probably attempt a stronger one at home for myself. Great place to bring some friends and hang though, will defintiely be back!"}
{"text":"I would say Jack's is a neighborhood staple!  I've never eaten here but the beers are always cold and there's always something on special.  I've never really been there when the place wasn't packed although it's usually mostly guys, but that's pretty much the norm in Charlotte.    The karaoke machine is always on and don't forget your quarters for the skeeball!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try out JJ's for quite awhile now and finally got around to it earlier this week with the beautiful weather here in Charlotte. Here's the breakdown:  5/5 stars for pet friendliness. You can bring your dog and hang out at one of the many outdoor seating areas.  4/5 stars for atmosphere. JJ's has tons of outdoor seating and is great for watching games on the big screen or ogling the many healthy people on a jog past the bar.  3/5 for food. Food was basic bar fare. I had the fresh avocado BLT with tator tots as my main course (honestly, I don't know why everyone doesn't serve tots - they are so delish), along with a taste of a chicken quesadilla and the bacon jalapeño hush puppies. Again - edible food, but nothing to write home about. 3/5 for service. Our service was a bit slow for a Tuesday night, especially considering the place wasn't packed. And our server may have been a bit confused as when I asked for a drink menu, she said there wasn't one, but then later brought out the condiment tray with a drink menu on it. Yes, that happened. If I hadn't already tucked into my vodka soda I may have swapped. Next time....  All in all, go to JJ's for the atmosphere and to while away a lazy weekend afternoon. Just know going in that the delicious beverages may lower your inhibitions and there is no shortage of greasy treats on the menu. I mean, funnel cake fries? Yes, please. Also something for next time...."}
{"text":"The place does feel like a barm with dark woods and big sports screens, but the menu is definitely not your standard bar fare! The Caribbean salad is amazing, the chicken tenders taste very homemade, and they have unique sauces like Honey Sriracha and Barbalo (barbecue/buffalo). They also deliver food to the Hare of the Dog a couple doors down, so you can eat at Jackalope's on a pretty outside patio with your dog!"}
{"text":"OK I love Jacks and I will still continue to go but now only when I can sit outside. The problem? The place is beginning to smell like an absolute sewer! This use to be the case for the ladies restroom only but it has spread and I can now smell it throughout the entire bar/restaurant. Now I get it Jack's is not about the pomp and frill, but come on fix your sewer issue, it's just plain gross. Anyway, they still have excellent prices on drinks, and decent bar food but I will  be relegated to the patio from here on out. I hope they fix this soon : ("}
{"text":"Jackalope Jacks.  Much like the mythical beast for which it is named, this establishment almost defies description.  For starters, it isn't the easiest place to find, especially as the night grows later.  As you drive by on 7th Street - perhaps more than once - the lyrics from Tag Team will undoubtedly go through your mind (Whoomp!  There it is!) as you figure out how to turn around, how to get to the parking lot, which lot to park in, then how to get into the place.  Once you manage that, you are most of the way there.  Once inside, it is still a bit of a maze.  It's like you've stepped into another dimension, as this place seems much larger on the inside than the outside.  On one side is the karaoke.  Make sure you check it out if you can.  On the the other side is the game room.  Straight ahead is more of a bar area.  All around is a massive crowd.  Somewhere in the midst are the restrooms.  As to service?  Friendly and decent, if not especially quick.  Food?  Adequate bar food, but the only thing distinguishing here are the tator tots.  Check them out if you get a chance.  You may want to double up, but you get a good-sized order, so take it easy if you aren't sure."}
{"text":"My favorite place.  Great staff that is friendly, fast service and fun. I often just like to hang out and watch TV or read to escape."}
{"text":"First time visitor, and I really like this place.  The California Wrap is one of the best I've ever had, anywhere.  Nice place to sit outside in the afternoon, and it's in a great part of town."}
{"text":"Jackalope Jack's is pretty solid in terms of decor, but the food is exactly as Yelp states for the 3-star rating: A-OK. I got the chicken avocado salad, which was very interesting, as it featured fresh greens, feta cheese, and the like. It was decent, but I think the drinks definitely outweigh the food in this case.   Regardless, I'll probably come back at some point since we gotta support local!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's just nice to belly up to a bar or a long table and take in some scary bad karaoke and dine on some tasty bar bites. So, for these intents & purposes, Jackalope Jacks fills the void. And it fills it well, too, if I may add.   A few yelpers and I dropped by Jack's after a OYE just down the street. Many of these fabulous yelpers had already had their fair share of al-co-ma-hol, so they were already in great spirits when we arrived. What I became privy to was a few bits of fabulousness:  1) Jackalope Jack's dishes out a pretty tasty gyro. Similar to Showmars style if that's what you dig.   2) Tater tots FTW. Definitely get the tots - they are delish. Just ask Jay R. - he ordered two baskets full of them, plus 14 PBRs. But that's another story completely.   3) The karaoke is pretty hysterical. Yeah, you'll hear a few folks who can actually sing, but it's the experience of hearing those who cannot sing that really makes this a gem.   I haven't been here when it's super low key, but I imagine it's a solid bar to grab some grub and hear some random dude sing I'm Too Sexy...which is even more inappropriate when he's in a priest getup and humping the microphone. Here's hoping that's only during Halloween weekend..."}
{"text":"I went with friends to watch a football game, and I enjoyed the atmosphere. The service was great and it wasn't too crowded while still providing a great viewing experience. We had a few solid appetizers, and their drink specials were on point!"}
{"text":"I'm verrrrrrrrrry disappointed to change my rating of Jacks. When I first moved here it was my go to place for just about everything. We were literally going 3 to 5 times a week. After awhile we noticed that the service was just starting to lack and the food was going a little down hill.   We went for a brunch once and whatever I got was horrible, and so was the service. Our server never even came back to check on us, and the bartender ended up being the one to give us our bill. I was pretty disappointed. The last 4 times we went I just felt it wasn't the same Jacks I fell in love with and bragged so much about.   They recently changed their menu and they basically took off everything that I  went there for!! I guess that explains why the stuff I got tasted pretty crappy the last few times I'd gone... maybe they were just fazing it out? I don't know but honestly I can say I will not jump for joy to go eat there again. The only thing they have left that I'd even get slightly excited about is the black bean quesadilla. :(   Now Jacks will pretty much just be my place for a karaoke night out. Really really bummed to have to change my review. I hardly EVER have done that."}
{"text":"I'll never go back to this place.  Worst service ever.  People shouldn't wait 12 minutes for a coke.  I didn't even get a chance to order my lunch.  I ordered my soda, it never came after 12 minutes and I left."}
{"text":"We went there. No hostess. Sat down for 5 minutes and no one came to provide a menu or offer a drink. We won't be back. Btw-it was a big college football day."}
{"text":"Jack's is my go-to place if I want to go out to eat, but don't have plans elsewhere. Their huge patio is a super dog-friendly, so I get to bring my pups with me if the weather cooperates. Their food is surprisingly good for a place most people think of more as a bar than a restaurant. My default is the avocado chicken salad, but if I'm feeling a splurge I love the chicken finger wrap with sweet potato tots. Divine. They also have a fabulous brunch on the weekends. If you need to recover after overindulging, I highly recommend the garbage plate. It's got everything you need to make your stomach a happy camper.  Even more important than a good atmosphere and good food, is the fact that Jacks loves to give back to the community. Almost every non-profit group I'm a part of has held some kind of fundraiser at Jacks and we've always had a great time. I love supporting businesses that support the people (and animals) of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Got there at 6pm, was practically empty.  Seated promptly and our waitress took our orders.  From there on it went downhill, it took a solid hour to get our food and like I said it was dead.  When we did get our food I was not impressed.  I could have gotten better quality food at any local fast food joint for half the price.  If you're going for drinking only, its probably a good spot, but don't go in expecting awesome food."}
{"text":"As I write this review I am sitting in the restaurant waiting over 20 minutes for our check. This is after waiting 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were there and give us menus then  having to send my pulled pork sandwich back after noticing a strange, acrid taste that turned out to be a burned black bun. Clearly they had to have seen this in the kitchen and not cared. The pork in the sandwich was dry, the coleslaw on top had no taste at all. None. Like it wasn't even there at all. I had to ask for a drink refill after 33 - yes I timed it - 33 minutes of waiting for our server to even come back. I asked for diet - got regular. After 33 minutes they couldn't even get that right. It is now 5 minutes later. She hasn't brought the check but did advise me when she delivered the wrong soda that they took the charcoaled sandwich I didn't eat off of the check.  Gee. Thanks."}
{"text":"Wow, what a waste of time and money. My friends and I drove here while staying in Myrtle Beach. One of my friends had seen this restaurant on some show and wanted to try it. The pulled pork was awful. It did not have any flavor. The restaurant was packed due to a soccer game. Service was decent considering how busy it was. Our waitress was not too friendly."}
{"text":"Dingy, Dark and full of Dudes.  At one time this was the happening place, at that time the Carolina Panthers were in the Superbowl. Since then this Bar has not changed. Fresh, lively competition just around the corner at the newly revamped Central Avenue area has put Jackalope Jacks where they belong. Worn out decor, sticky table tops and the stale stench of spilled beer remind you why its no longer the 7th street favorite. This is not the place to take a date nor to find one. If your idea of getting SH$t faced on a weeknight then this may be your spot. On several occasions I have witnessed patrons so \"smashed\" they could barely stand up on their own and still getting served. The only positive is that the food is an 8/10. Waitstaff and bartender's are \"burnt\" out\" and plain clothed with little personality. I advise you to not use the TouchTunes music system. Our song's were in the queue when they decided it was time to switch every tv in the place to the basketball game - they were never played after nor were we re-imbursed. The second time we played songs we had 4 in line with one playing when a waitress takes a remote and stops one of our songs then skips 2 of our songs because a random Drunk guy wants to hear his rap song next - again, we were never compensated and the Bartender \"Kelly\" was rude about it. She went from Mrs. Nice to Mrs. I don't give a crap since her Boyfriend with Pork chop side-burns sat at the corner as to be her security guard all in all while he checked out girls at the Bar. This place is obviously struggling for business and the evening crowd is mostly gross drunk dudes trolling for anything with boobs.  I will not be back - too many other choices around the corner that know how to run a restaurant and hire staff with upbeat personalities. Ugghh..."}
{"text":"Jackalope Jack's is seldom an intended destination of mine, but I tend to wind up there frequently. I'm of the NoDa/Midwood ilk, and Jack's clearly appeals to a different layer of the Charlotte nightlife substrata. It's in that spot that kind of slithers through the 7th street skein that extends the uptown vibe, with well-kempt preppie sorts who seem to carry themselves a little more rigid and a little more sexy than what I'm typically accustomed to, down toward midwood, where things get a little more artsy and dirty. Were it not situated next to Cajun Queen (one of my fave restaurants in the area), I might never have embraced it. But, I'm glad I did.  Last time I visited, I was in a peculiar mood - a bit post-dinner punchdrunk and a touch infatuated with one particular lady in our crew. As we walked in, I offered her a joking warning: \"I kind of hate this place. Every time I come here, I wanna fight every guy in here.\" She giggled. \"Please don't pick a fight.\" I shrugged. It was early spring, a Saturday night, cool enough to let us all feel the hot breaths between us. Jack's was full up with others of my temperament, if not my type - sparkly dressed young halters barstooling the corner wall to the left of the taps... clean-shaven, sideways-hat-wearin' mid-20s guys with tough-lookin' shoulders and ill-fitting pants, and then a mix of just fun-loving casuals filling up the game-room - punching bags and rolling skiballs and shooting pool and all that.  Karaoke was happening pretty hardcore in the far room, in that odd space where the perimeter is stationed by dinner patrons putting back their plates of wings and burgers and meatball skewers... their platters of thick-breaded fish and chips, chili-mac stuffed grilled cheeses, boats of brew and tall frosty glasses... beneath those dim and fast-spinning lights, and all around before and about them awkward groovers dancing and laughing and just getting in the way.  The melodic singalongs make hard transitions from 90s hip-hop to early 2000s country hits back down to 80s synth and then back up to modern club songs. As I head-bobbed my way through some spirited, if not off-key, renditions of Baby Got Back and Friends in Low Places, I really started to feel it. But then this fellow, this stately older gentlemen in a white button down tucked purposefully into his khaki pants, who seemed so out of place he became almost perfect for it, stepped up and started crushing the karaoke stage... booming southern croon spilling out with silk and baritone the most romantic of old-school ballads. Barely-legals rushed to hug him and kiss his cheeks as he posed for photos between songs. Then the ole chap busted out a trumpet and the whole bar just lost its mind.  I eased in behind my girl and rubbed her shoulders and put my chin to her wild, over-spilling hair. \"This guy's killing it!\" I said. She leaned back and nodded. I wedged my way in at the corner of the bar to signal for the next round. Jack's is never not busy. And the bartenders crush it. I'm starting to learn their routine... There's the tall handsome guy - with the veiny forearms and floppish sandy blond bangs falling sideways over his chiseled face. He owns the taps, skilled with a fast, low-head pour. Then there's the feisty little goldilocks with the tiny hands and the tight skin who fetches glasses and mixes cocktails so deft and nimble it's like she's weaving a tapestry. You never wait long, you never have to shout your order twice, and you're always greeted with a smile shot from a face as impossibly happy as your own. My crew ended up at the tables out front, our goosebumped skin soaking in the chilled night air. Our gins n' tonics and vodkas n' sodas and jacks n' cokes were all well proportioned, filled tall, and serviced with pride. Occasional flat-glasses of straight melon vodka elevated our warm cheeks and the mingling conversations of music and groomsmanship took things further.  The other patio guests, faces soft-lit under the scattered amber of the rope-light bulbs strung up under the taupe umbrellas, seemed to all be settled into an evening of similar condition - young, happy, free and easy to please.  I ran my fingers through that girl's hair, that one that had me spun up, and got them all tangled in her maddening curls. \"I take it back,\" I said. \"This place ain't so bad.\"  \"That's cuz you're here with me, right?\" All smiles, I nodded up and down.  Behind us, the big wooden door to the check-your-ID foyer opened with a long creak. A couple was leaving; the fellow stepped out, one of those young guys in the baggy pants with the sideways hat, and he spun and pulled the door wide for his lady and drooped and almost curtsied a bit as he saw her safely through. He then eased the door closed and put his arm behind her as they went down the steps. I grinned heavy at his well-executed chivalry.  Maybe Jacks appeals to my kinda people after all."}
{"text":"I've been to Jacks about, eh, a hundred times now. A ton of games and my friends are use to me running out of change and asking for dollars by now lol.  If you go during the week, you can typically grab a table and have a chill time. If you go on a Friday or Saturday the place is usually rocking with karoake and the bar is packed. If I head that way on the weekends, I try to go early then hop somewhere else - the place gets slammed... no, no I mean SLAMMED. After this point, good luck getting to the bar for a drink. And you could throw a rock and hit a drunk person easily.   The patio is awesome and I love heading there in the summer. Jacks serves brunch on Sundays and doggies are welcome as well so pretty cool spot for that. Yet I've gone a few times at night and ordered food. Make sure you're not in a hurry as the food tends to take a bit longer. I've never had this issue during the day so not sure what the deal is at night.   But other than that, if you are looking for a liquid dinner, a fun game spot or a place with high energy, you found it here."}
{"text":"Typically I love Jack's, it's always one of my go to brunch spots since it's so close to my house and the atmosphere is great.  Yesterday wasn't the best experience I've ever had.  We got there at 11:15 with a group of 7, we quickly got a table outside however it took quite sometime for us to get a waitress.  We put in some appetizer orders (wings and nachos) those both came out at separate time, about 30 mins apart.  We ordered our lunch and it took forever!  I remember looking at my watch at it was 12:30...the only thing making this wait see okay was the fact that we could indulge in some cold beverages. Our food was okay, not one to complain when I'm starving, but only a couple plates came out with the rights/toppings and the presentation was pretty slack.  Not to say I'll never go back, however I might do a quick drive by to see how packed it is before hand."}
{"text":"So who would have thunk that this place had a good brunch??  Welp, they do.  Go at 11 and there will not be a crowd.  Come at 11:30, and it's a wee bit busy.    Saturday night Kareoke is pretty awesome too.  Love the crowd participation."}
{"text":"I love Jacks.  Not only is it a fun bar, but the food is great too!  They have lots to choose from on the menu and everything is good...especially the wraps!  In a great location on 7th street - they've expanded their outdoor seating and they have cornhole boards set up daily.  Outside on the patio for a beer on a sunny day or inside playing ski ball....either way it's a favorite!"}
{"text":"Ok so lemme preface this with... This place is a great time for drinks and laughs! Let me then move onto food--- ew! We used to go a few years ago and really enjoyed the menu!! Went back last night to some horrible non breaded cardboard tasting \"fried ravioli\".. Then had nachos that were literally just \"fine\", but everyone I was with got salads and they said they were ok however they looked awful! I swear, I either grew up and over gross food.. Or jacks has a new kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"Average bar environment and food. Staff isn't overly friendly and always rushed.  Just for a quick appetizer or to watch a game it's ok.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  Chips and salsa were amazing. The wings were great as well.  The bartender took care of us..  I would def come back."}
{"text":"So I ventured all the way uptown to this place, primarily for karaoke. However, we were hungry and I had read a review that this place was featured on man vs food. So you can say I was EXTREMELY excited. Karaoke and good food! There was no host, but the doorman was gracious enough to seat us and make sure a server came to the table.  The server was good. We ordered nachos with chili (the chili was AMAZING!) and the chili made the nachos, we also indulged in some tater tots (ehh, ok). Then we waited around until 12 (yes, I said 12) until the karaoke started. The DJ was suppose to start at 10/10:30. What made it worse was the DJ not only arrived late, but then he was set up for 45 minutes prior to announcing the first singer. If you are a karaoke enthusiast, Do not, I repeat DO NOT go here! (unless they get another DJ) Please see my other posts for karaoke places in Charlotte! The outside seating is great...If karaoke was half way decent, I probably would have given this place 3.5 to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Jackalopes what happened?!!! This used to be my favorite place. They did some renovations and it's a very nice venue. But they've hired some new staff and the waitresses are TERRIBLE. I always sit in the karaoke/TV section. The last few times I've been there service has been horrible. After you get your food and drinks they disappear. And this is at like 8pm on a Saturday when the place is nowhere near packed.   The last 2 times I came my friends and I ended up just leaving my money on the table without a check. One time my friend hunted the waitress down TWICE and asked for our checks. She was sitting outside talking to some guys and kept saying \"I'll be there in a minute.\" I went this past Saturday and the same thing happened. A group of 2 other women just left because they were tired of waiting. We also had a huge group sitting next to us that was getting restless. And it's not like you can just grab another waitress or someone. They all go AWOL.   I'm used to bringing 4+ people here for dinner, buying $100+ in drinks (just for me - don't judge, lol) and tipping very well. The new staff is very lazy and missing out on a lot of money. Not just for themselves but for the entire bar. I love this venue and so do a lot of others PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER!!!  P.S. I miss Rachel. Not sure why they changed karaoke vendors. But the new karaoke guy is very personable and talented."}
{"text":"Meh, I've had better experiences.   It was a beautiful day, so we wanted to go somewhere close to enjoy both the weather and Sunday foootball. We were able to enjoy both.  However, the food and service is what givesthis place a poor rating. I ordered an Aslaskan benedict with hasbrowns. It wasn't as tasteful as I expected, the benedit was dry and the hasbrowns were cool. The service... slow. Our server took awhile to greet us, so we had to order with another waitress. After ordering, we had to wait a good amount of time for our food, which as I mentioned earlier, were cool. The Alaskan benedict was rather dry, I wouldn't reccommend it. My boyfriend got a burger with hasbrowns, which were also cool.  Finding our server to get the check was also a challenge. And waiting on her to get back with our check was another challenge as we were in a hurry to make an appointment. Overall, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Yep the mini corn dogs with spicy ketchup were delicious! Everyone was nice, bartenders were cool. I'm glad I was able to come check this place out before they close their doors for good."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend chose this place because of all the good reviews. We walked in and no one helped us until we walked all the way up to the bar. The bartender told us to pick anywhere to sit and they would be right with us. It was a beautiful day, so we sat on the patio (where most of the guests were sitting. We chose a table that was dirty, but it was the only one available. After seeing many other people being helped by various servers, we were still not noticed at all. We even saw a server walk out of the restaurant, look around the entire patio, then walk back inside. After ten minutes of waiting and no help, we gave up on getting any service and simply left. I wish I could comment on the food, as it smelled good and we were very hungry at the time, but due to no one acknowledging us, I have no idea how the food or drinks are."}
{"text":"It is what it is. A chill, casual spot to get drinks with friends.  I went late one night during the week for drinks with friends, and I was impressed with the craft beer selection. They have a decent amount of options in cans and on draft. They also always seem to have a special. Liquor is cheap too.   I did not try the food, but it seems as though they serve food late, which is a big plus for me.   The bartenders were nice and we had a good time. I like that they are open late, so it seems like it would be a good option at almost any time.   It's a \"divey\" spot, but that's what I like about it. There will always be a time and place for Jackalope Jacks."}
{"text":"Excellent neighboor bar... I dont make it over there often but have fun when I do. This trip was because of a living social deal I had purchased... it was good on food and drinks so it was mainly used on delishious beer. It was sunday and they had $2 beer draft specials so we got a lot for our money. The server said their buffalo chicken egg rolls were made in house and super tasty so we ordered... they were way to greasy... greasy fried chicken, cheese and then greasy egg roll... my stomach did not approve. They have a decent menu, lots of options, their brunch on the weekend is the best. Perfect hangover helper!"}
{"text":"Huh?? I thought I already wrote a review for Jackalope! Wait...Maybe I was kind of drunk when I wrote it, and didn't post it...maybe...  Well lets get the show on the road, shall we?  Jackie is a great place to hangout with buddies, since it's a really casual bar. So you can go there right after work.Since, if you're like me, who once go home is too lazy to go out. lol Their drinks are good, depending on which one you're getting though. Do not, and I mean Do NOT get Eskimo Slugger. I had it and gosh, it was awful! It tasted like cough medicine! However the four drinks I had afterward tasted pretty good. I would recommend on getting Sex on The Beach, if you're a gal who like \"girly\" drinks that has a punch or two to it, like myself! lol   I haven't try their foods yet so I can't tell you how good it is, sorry! (I'll write another review about the food)   Now on to the service. Their staffs is pretty nice. The bartender, John, was pretty cool. He even remembered my name! Well, he said I kill my drinks... It's not my fault that I can drink five glasses fast without getting wasted... And no, I'm not an alcoholic. Lol  Overall, Jackie is a pretty cool place that has nice staffs, and good drinks. Also they even have billiard there and some other games to play. Oh yeah! They have karaoke night on Friday, which is really entertaining! Especially when the singer isn't good, then you just want to sing with them too!"}
{"text":"Great appies and bar specials!  The Disco Fries are insanely good...almost a gourmet poutine (for my fello Canadian peeps!) and the mussels were great too. Cool patio vibe. Great date night spot."}
{"text":"Went there for a Saturday lunch. Some good and bad.  Good service. The Coke tasted funny, and the waitresses was quick to exchange it for a sweet tea. The chicken in the Caesar salad was very good.  But ... I ordered the burger medium and it was close to raw. It made the bun fall apart. For $8.99 -- a big miss. A little skimpy on the fries, too. Except for the chicken, the Caesar salad was very average -- and way too much dressing.  We ate outside because inside smelled funny.  Dined there on a coupon. Worth a shot, but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"First of, let me clarify... this is an one incident bad enough to warrant its own 1-star (if I can give zero, I would) review.  After the Yelpy Award night, a few of us decided to get a bite and a drink to keep the party going.  It was about 10pm when we arrived, not late by any means for a bar.  We ordered food and drinks.  We were aware that our waitress is new (3 day old).  The service was a little slow, but what the heck, we're having a good time talking.  Then it dawned on us that it's REALLY REALLY SLOW.  As in 45, 50 minutes later we still haven't had food, and the waitress had barely came by.   The place was virtually empty.  It doesn't take almost an hour to fix a few sandwich wraps and fries.  Plus people don't order food at 10pm unless they are just-got-out-of-prison hungry!  We started to voice out loud our frustration, I mean, last I checked I'm in the US and I have the freedom of speech to say whatever the heck I want as long as I don't scream \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater (I know I learned something in school...).  There was another waitress out on the patio doing clean up work.  And before we knew it, she HUFFED and PUFFED right by us and said LOUD ENOUGH for us to hear \"F$#K, YALL ARE KILLING ME\"  I am not sure which school of waitressing this chick came from, but I'm damn sure that's unacceptable at anywhere.  And boy she picked the wrong table to F with... a table full of Yelpers?!  We eat for a living and we sure as heck have an opinion and the whole darn world is going to hear about it. Man, I was pissed... this chick done got my neck-twisting, finger-snapping side out of me.  A NOTE TO MANAGEMENT (if you are reading): 1. Please tell your waitresses to NEVER be so rude to your customers. NEVER, no exception, even if the customer was rude (which we weren't).  I waited tables, so I had rude customers, go b!tch in the kitchen.  2. Keep your tables informed if there's some unusual wait time.  How the heck would we know you had a big take-out order if you don't tell us?  Let us decide if we want to wait (thus forfeit our right to complain) or not wait.  3. The F word is to be never used at any table for any reason whatsoever by your staff!      This is one of my fav spots in town, and it was such a disappointment to have to encounter this myself (on an empty Wednesday night to say the least).  I have sticked my neck out plenty of times for this place, and now I can't even use my usual line \"I never had bad service here, ever\" anymore"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. The food is actually pretty good for bar food. Try the BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado) (also with the option to add turkey) & potato salad as a side. (my favorite) Very friendly servers & bartenders! They also have an awesome rewards program with free food & free $$$ (alcohol included)"}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting North Carolina and we were only staying for the weekend to watch the Panthers play the Packers. I came here on a Saturday night around 3pm to watch some college football with my husband. I liked how it was located inside a house, like most of the retail/restaurant stores in Charlotte/Elizabeth area. It was pretty quiet and not too busy. There were some families with their kids as well. Huge TV screen in the back by a pool table and seating area with several other TV's on. The service was decent- there was a lag when we first arrived to when we got our first drink. Prices are decent, similar to NY's which was weird. All together, it was a decent bar."}
{"text":"So far so good. Been here twice now. The first time just for drinks and last night for some football, food, and drinks. The crowd was very mixed, but pleasant all the same. My friend is a regular, so I was able to meet some new people. Overall, no complaints.. Ordered a grilled chicken salad... it was really good. It was way too much to finish-but will have again for sure. My friend had a burger and fries.. both good.   Looks like I have a new place to enjoy a game or two!"}
{"text":"Now this is my best friend Hollie and fellow yelper's hot spot. She's gotten me I. This place quite a few times. I have never had bad service here. Not to mention everyone is there treats you like an old friend. I love the fried pickles, they are slices not chips. Something about that makes a big difference. All of their quesadillas are mouth watering too. There's actually nothing here I haven't liked. That includes the food and service. This is def a good spot to hang with friends, watch a game or grab a bite with a nice drink."}
{"text":"Thursdays are also karaoke night and with such a wide array of talent on stage, this makes for one entertaining bar. The eclectic mix of songs performed allowed us sing along with Oasis, laugh to the Bloodhound Gang, cry to Journey and sip gin and juice with Snoop.   I'm not mad at the host for ending the night by singing  \"who's gonna drive you home\" either. Quite fitting eh?  With an army of industrial fans working on the patio, drinking outside on \"hot summer nights\" becomes bearable and actually pleasant.  Hooray for fans."}
{"text":"The place is very fun as one side has TVs and the other side has ski ball and pool table. Lots of outdoor seating and staff was all very friendly. We only ordered appetizers. Best Tater tots I've had in a long time. Perfectly cooked. Also had the the pepperoni rolls which were also very good. Only bad thing was the marinara sauce that came with the pep rolls was more like a salsa and didn't have very good flavor. The menu looked good and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I always drive by it on 7th street, but got to try it the other night for a casual get-together for a bachelor party.  Was a little leery of the parking situation, but there is plenty in the back.  7th street can be a pretty busy street with pedestrians and cars so just slow down and be cautious!  There have already been a few incidents with drunk drivers and pedestrians in this part of town.  It was a large group of us so we took up a corner of the patio/deck area and had our own \"private\" tv to watch the ball game on.  Our waitress was nice and handled our group pretty well.  We ended up ordering some onion rings and nachos... both good appetizers for sharing and a large crowd.  We eventually had dinner there as well.  I tried the country fried chicken with jalapeno mac and cheese... of course fried okra.  The chicken was cooked nicely with some great breading (light) and gravy - not drowning in it... just right.  The okra was perfect... again nice light breading to make it fried goodness with the okra nice and cooked inside.  Mac and cheese was good.  Overall I thought the food was above \"bar food status\"..... it is a bit on the higher end of the $$ end, but well worth it.  Later we partook in skeeball and shooting some hoops.  Good times had by all."}
{"text":"Good place to go and catch virtually any game because they have about 10 tvs in every room. But the food is ehh and the waiters are hit or miss. First time I went I had absolutely horrible service, which is why it's getting two stars. The second time I went they didn't wow me but were much better."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this short and sweet.                                          Bullet Point Style!!!!  -  If I lived closer I'd be here all the time  -  If you live close and aren't there all the time, then we aren't friends -  This place gets 5 stars because it knows what it is and does it perfectly. -  Jacks gets 5 stars because they don't price gouge you for quality food and/or libations. -  While I don't agree with him 70% of the time the owner is active and vocal on facebook, and is, at the very least, informed. -  Everything (with VERY few exceptions) is American made at Jacks. -  There are games  That's it, check it out if you haven't. Over and out."}
{"text":"Very good food! We ended up here because a restaurant we wanted to try was too busy. This was a great chance to try Jackalope Jack's. Everyone's food was great and the waitress was very personable. Hardly anyone was in the restaurant so she was very attentive and the food was great. If I'm ever in the Charlotte area again around lunchtime I will definitely go back."}
